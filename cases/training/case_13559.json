    "summary": "<p>On October 25, 2011, a group of citizens (Occupy Ft. Meyers) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against the City of Fort Myers, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging that the defendant's municipal code unconstitutionally suppressed plaintiff's activities. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for a preliminary injunction to restrain enforcing certain portions of the code and to declare that such portions violated the rights to free speech, assembly and association, under the First Amendment.</p><p>Defendant had employed a code requiring a special permit-signed by the chief or authorized member of the police department-for every parade, procession or public open-air meeting. Around October 11, 2011, the plaintiff began organizing the Occupy Fort Myers movement and held political activities (e.g., rally, building tents and information booths) at Centennial Park to promote awareness of the influence of private money in the nation's political process. The plaintiff attempted to acquire a \"Special Events\" permit but was denied presumably due to lack of the required liability insurance policy. On October 20, 2011, the police department of the defendant began issuing citations to plaintiff for remaining overnight in the park. Subsequently, plaintiff filed this suit.</p><p>The plaintiff argued that defendant's code: (1) provided targeted regulation of political speech with uncontrolled discretion in City officials to approve or deny permits; (2) included vague language as to cause citizens to censor speech and conduct; and (3) included language suppressing citizens' liberty interest in lounging on public benches and places. The defendant contended in part that portions of the code-some of which were to be repealed-were not enforced and thus request for the preliminary injunction was moot.</p><p>On November 15, 2012, the District Court (Judge Steele) issued an order for preliminary injunction to some of the plaintiff's claims. On November 17, 2011, the defendant denied plaintiff's request for a permit, and around 11:00 pm, the police department demanded that the plaintiff leave the park or face arrest.</p><p>The plaintiff and defendant negotiated a settlement agreement. On March 4, 2013, the District Court (Judge Steele) dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>",

FRANK GUBASTA, ZACHARY\nKUHN, HILARY MAINS, MATT McDOWELL,\nMICHELLE  MEYER,  LUIS  OSPINA,  RYAN\nPOGUE,  FRANK  PRATT,  MARLENE\nROBINSON, and JUSTIN VALO,\nPlaintiff,\nvs. Case No.  2:11-cv-00608-FtM-29DNF\nCITY OF FORT MYERS,\nDefendant.\n_____________________________________\nOPINION AND ORDER\nThis matter comes before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Amended\nEmergency  Motion  for  a  Preliminary  Injunction  and  Request  for\nExpedited  Hearing  (Doc.  #10)  filed  on  October  26,  2011. \nPlaintiffs,  Occupy  Fort  Myers,  Cindy  Banyai,  Stephanie  Darst,\nChristopher Faulner, F. Frank Gubasta, Zachary Kuh, Hilary Mains,\nMatt  McDowell,  Michelle  Meyer,  Luis  Ospina,  Ryan  Pogue,  Frank\nPratt,  Marlene  Robinson,  and  Justin  Valo  (collectively,\n“plaintiffs” or “Occupy Fort Myers”), seek to enjoin the defendant,\nthe  City  of  Fort  Myers  (“defendant”  or  “City”),  its  officers,\nemployees, and agents, from enforcing certain provisions of the\nFort Myers City Code of Ordinances and from issuing additional\ncriminal penalties to plaintiffs based upon violations of these\nordinances.  Plaintiffs assert that the challenged city ordinances\n\non their face violate plaintiffs’ rights to free speech, assembly,\nand association under the First Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and/or their substantive due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs\nfiled a Verified Complaint (Doc. #1) which attached a number of\naffidavits, a Memorandum of Law (Doc. #5), and an exhibit (Doc.\n#30) in support of their request for a preliminary injunction.  \nThe City opposes the preliminary injunction, filing a Response\n(Doc. #29), various affidavits in opposition (Docs. #23, 24, 25,\n31), and exhibits (Docs. #27, 28).  The Court heard oral argument\non  October  31,  2011.    The  City  thereafter  filed  supplemental\nauthority  (Doc.  #36)  as  requested  by  the  Court  during  oral\nargument,  and  several  additional  exhibits  (Docs.  ##35,  37). \nPlaintiffs filed a Response (Doc. #38) to the additional filings. \nAt the request of the Court, the City then filed a Response (Doc.\n#42) to one of the issues raised at oral argument.\nI.\nAccording to the Complaint, Occupy Fort Myers (“Occupy Fort\nMyers” or “OFM”) is an unincorporated association of individuals\nwho have gathered in Fort Myers, Florida “to bring visibility to\nthe influence of private money into the nation’s political process” \n(Doc. # 1, ¶4) and “attempt to bring visibility to the insidious\ninfluence of money into the U.S. political process, and to inform\nmembers of the general public on political issues such as social\n-2-\n\njustice and economic equality.”  (Doc. #1, ¶19).  “A core purpose\nof [Occupy Fort Myers] is to bring awareness to the concerns about\nthe U.S. political process and economic policy through symbolic,\naround-the-clock, peaceful protests referred to as ‘occupations.’”\n(Doc. #1, ¶4.)  \nPrior to a planned rally, Occupy Fort Myers contacted the Fort\nMyers Police Department (FMPD) to inquire about obtaining a permit\nfor the rally and march in downtown Fort Myers.  Occupy Fort Myers\nwas told it could rally and march on October 15, 2011, if it did\nnot  use  a  megaphone,  march  in  the  street,  or  include  vulgar\nlanguage on signs.  (Id. at ¶21).  As to the symbolic occupation of\nCentennial Park, the FMPD advised Occupy Fort Myers to contact the\nCity’s Recreation Division for a permit for overnight occupation. \nOccupy Fort Myers held a noon rally and march on October 15, 2011,\nand  began  “occupying”  Centennial  Park  that  evening  without  a\npermit.  From October 15, 2011, through October 19, 2011, members\nof  Occupy  Fort  Myers  were  allowed  to  “occupy”  Centennial  Park\novernight without a permit. (Id. at ¶24.)  \nOn October 18, 2011, the City provided Occupy Fort Myers with\na “Special Events” pamphlet (Doc. #30) which included information\nand  an  application  for  a  permit  to  remain  in  the  City  parks\novernight.  Occupy Fort Myers completed the permit application and\nsubmitted it to the City’s Recreation Division on the same day. \n(Id. at ¶25.)  \n-3-\n\nOn October 19, 2011, the City informed Occupy Fort Myers that\nbefore its permit application could be reviewed it was necessary\nfor it to obtain a $1 million liability insurance policy and bring\nthe insurance certificate to the City.  Occupy Fort Myers was\ninformed that the City intended to enforce the ordinance which\nprohibits setting up tents and overnight camping in a park beyond\nclosing  hours  if  Occupy  Fort  Myers  did  not  comply  with  the\ninsurance requirement.  Under that ordinance, city parks are open\nfrom  6:00  a.m.  until  10:30  p.m.    Although  the  City  initially\nrequired insurance from Occupy Fort Myers by October 18, 2011, at\n3:00 p.m., the City extended the time to comply until October 19,\n2011.  (Id. at ¶¶26-27.) \nOn October 19, 2011, Occupy Fort Myers informed the City that\nit could not comply with the insurance requirement.  The City gave\nOccupy Fort Myers the names of three insurance companies and agreed\nto  allow  an  additional  day  for  Occupy  Fort  Myers  to  obtain\ninsurance.  (Id. at ¶27.)  Later on October 19, Occupy Fort Myers\ninformed the City that the three insurance companies would not\nprovide an insurance policy, and that Occupy Fort Myers could not\ncomply with the insurance requirement.  (Id. at ¶28).  In any\nevent,  Occupy  Fort  Myers  asserts  it  has  no  funds  to  pay  for\ninsurance even if it was available.  (Id. at ¶29).  The City also\ninformed Occupy Fort Myers that it would be required to obtain\nanother permit and an insurance policy every ten days.  (Id.) \n-4-\n\nOccupy Fort Myers asserts that there are no procedures to appeal\nthe City’s denial of their request for a waiver of insurance or the\ndenial of the permit.  (Id.)   \nOn October 20, 2011, Occupy Fort Myers continued to negotiate\nwith the City for a permit, but the City would neither issue a\npermit nor identify any procedure for requesting either waiver or\nappeal.  (Id. at ¶30.)  Accordingly, on the evening of October 20,\n2011, at approximately 10:45 p.m., the FMPD began issuing citations\nto individuals for violating City ordinances.  According to the\nComplaint, eleven of the twelve individual plaintiffs have received\nat least one $135 citation between October 20 and 22, 2011, for\ntheir involvement in “symbolic First Amendment-protected speech.” \n(Id. at ¶¶5-16.)1  The twelfth individual plaintiff, while not\ncited, participates and assists in OFM activities, and feels that\nhis and others’ speech rights have been hindered and chilled by the\nalleged unconstitutional ordinances.  (Id. at ¶17.)\nPlaintiffs filed a four-count Complaint (Doc. #1) pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Count One asserts that Ordinances §§ 2-271\nthrough 2-273 (the “Special Events Advisory Board Ordinance”) and\nOrdinance  §  58-156  (the  “Park  Regulations  Ordinance”)  are\nunconstitutional on their face as “viewpoint discrimination” in\nviolation of the First Amendment.  Count Two asserts that the\n1The Chief of Police has filed Affidavits stating that as of\nOctober 26, 2011, seventy-three (73) citations have been issued. \n(Docs. #23, 31). \n-5-\n\nSpecial Events Advisory Board Ordinance, Ordinance § 86-153 (the\n“Parades  and  Processions  Ordinance”),  and  the  Park  Regulation\nOrdinance are unconstitutionally overbroad on their face.  Count\nThree asserts that the Park Regulation Ordinance is impermissibly\nvague and unconstitutional on its face. Count Four alleges that the\nPark Regulation Ordinance and the Parades and Processions Ordinance\non their face violate plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment liberty\ninterests to lounge on public benches and places “according to\ntheir inclination” and to “meet” with others in “open air” places\nwithin the City limits.  Plaintiffs correctly assert the Court has\njurisdiction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C    §§  1331  and  1343(a),  and\nincorrectly allege jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and\n§2202.2 \nII.\nA federal court has inherent authority to issue an injunction \nto remedy a violation of constitutional rights.  Klay v. United\nHealthgroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 1092, 1097 (11th Cir. 2004).  “The\npurpose of the preliminary injunction is to preserve the positions\nof the parties as best we can until a trial on the merits may be\nheld.”  Bloedorn v. Grube, 631 F.3d 1218, 1229 (11th Cir. 2011). \n2GTE Directories Pub. Corp. v. Trimen Am., 67 F.3d 1563, 1567\n(11th  Cir.1995)(“At  the  outset  we  note  that  the  Declaratory\nJudgment  Act  does  not  enlarge  the  jurisdiction  of  the  federal\ncourts but rather is operative only in respect to controversies\nwhich are such in the constitutional sense.... Thus the operation\nof the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only.” (internal\ncitation and punctuation omitted)).\n-6-\n\n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that\nhe is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the\nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in\nthe public interest.”  Winter v.NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The\nEleventh Circuit has described the four “well known” prerequisites\nfor such a preliminary injunction as follows:\nA district court may grant injunctive relief only if the\nmoving  party  shows  that:  (1)  it  has  a  substantial\nlikelihood  of success on the merits; (2) irreparable\ninjury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; (3)\nthe threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever\ndamage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing\nparty; and (4) if issued, the injunction would not be\nadverse to the public interest.\nSiegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). \nThe burden of persuasion for each of the four requirements is upon\nthe party seeking the preliminary injunction.  Siegel, 234 F.3d at\n1176.  These same standards apply in cases involving the First\nAmendment.    E.g., Citizens for Police Accountability Political\nComm. v. Browning, 572 F.3d 1213, 1217 (11th Cir. 2009); Solantic,\nLLC v. City of Neptune Beach, 410 F.3d 1250, 1253 n.3 (11th Cir.\n2005).  “[A] preliminary injunction in advance of trial is an\nextraordinary remedy.”  Bloedorn, 631 F.3d at 1229.\nIII.\nThe overarching issue is whether plaintiffs have satisfied all\nfour prerequisites to obtain a preliminary injunction as to any of\n-7-\n\nthe challenged ordinances.  The Court discusses each requirement in\nturn.\nA. Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nThe bulk of the arguments and issues focus on this prong of\nthe requirements for a preliminary injunction.  If an ordinance\ndoes not violate the First Amendment, plaintiffs cannot show a\nlikelihood of success on the merits as to that ordinance.  Gold\nCoast Publ’g, Inc. v. Corrigan, 421 F.3d 1336, 1343 (11th Cir.\n1994).  If plaintiffs are unable to show a substantial likelihood\nof success on the merits, the Court need not consider the other\nrequirements for a preliminary injunction.  Bloedorn, 631 F.3d at\n1229.\n(1)  First Amendment Applies to Municipal Governments:\nTo start at the beginning, the First Amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution provides in pertinent part that “Congress shall make\nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . or the right of\nthe people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for\na redress of grievances.”  U.S. Const. amend. I.  The Supreme Court\nhas  long  held  that  the  First  Amendment  applies  to  the  States\nthrough  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.    Members  of  City  Council  v.\nTaxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 792 n. 2 (1984), citing Lovell\nv.  Griffin,  303  U.S.  444,  450  (1938)  (“Freedom  of  speech  and\nfreedom of the press, which are protected by the First Amendment\nfrom infringement by Congress, are among the fundamental personal\n-8-\n\nrights  and  liberties  which  are  protected  by  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment  from  invasion  by  state  action”  (citing  cases)). \nLikewise,  “municipal  ordinances  adopted  under  state  authority\nconstitute  state  action  and  are  within  the  prohibition  of  the\n[First] [A]mendment”.  Lovell, 303 U.S. at 450.  No party disputes\nthat  the  First  Amendment  applies  to  the  City  of  Fort  Myers\nordinances.\n(2)  First Amendment Framework:\nIt is well settled that the First Amendment protection of\nspeech  and  assembly  is  not  absolute.    Thus,  while  the  First\nAmendment applies to the City’s conduct, a city government “need\nnot  permit  all  forms  of  speech  on  property  that  it  owns  and\ncontrols.”  International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.\nLee, 505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992).  A three step process is useful when\nassessing whether government restrictions are valid under the First\nAmendment:  “[F]irst,  determining  whether  the  First  Amendment\nprotects the speech at issue, [second,] identifying the nature of\nthe forum, and [third,] assessing whether the . . . justifications\nfor  restricting  [  ]  speech  ‘satisfy  the  requisite  standard.’” \nMahoney v. Doe, 642 F.3d 1112, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2011), quoting\nCornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 797\n(1985). \n-9-\n\n(3)  Is Conduct Within Protection of the First Amendment:\n“As  a  threshold  matter,  we  must  ask  whether  the  First\nAmendment protects the conduct at issue in the challenged ordinance\n. . . .”  DA Mortg., Inc., 486 F.3d at 1265-66.  Plaintiffs bear\nthe burden of establishing that the First Amendment applies to\ntheir conduct.  Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468\nU.S. 288, 293 n.5 (1984); United States v. Gilbert, 920 F.2d 878,\n883 (11th Cir. 1991).  “Whether certain activity or speech is\nprotected by the first amendment is a question of law for the\ndistrict court.”  Sykes v. McDowell, 786 F.2d 1098, 1103 (11th Cir.\n1986). \n“[I]t has been universally recognized that one of the primary\npurposes of the First Amendment is to ‘protect the free discussion\nof governmental affairs’ because the maintenance of a responsible\ndemocratic government depends upon it.”  Cooper v. Dillon, 403 F.3d\n1208, 1214 (11th Cir.  2005), quoting Landmark Comm’s., Inc., 435\nU.S. 829, 838 (1978).  As the Supreme Court recently stated:  \nSpeech on matters of public concern is at the heart of\nthe First Amendment's protection.  The First Amendment\nreflects a profound national commitment to the principle\nthat  debate  on  public  issues  should  be  uninhibited,\nrobust, and wide-open.  That is because speech concerning\npublic affairs is more than self-expression; it is the\nessence of self-government.    Accordingly, speech on\npublic issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy\nof First Amendment values, and is entitled to special\nprotection.\nSnyder v. Phelps, 131 S. Ct. 1207, 1215 (2011)(internal citations\nand punctuation omitted).  “Speech deals with matters of public\n-10-\n\nconcern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter\nof political, social, or other concern to the community, or when it\nis a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of\ngeneral interest and of value and concern to the public.”  Snyder,\n131 S. Ct. at 1215 (citations and internal punctuation omitted). \nThere is no dispute that much of the conduct by Occupy Fort\nMyers and its participants falls within the protection of the First\nAmendment.  The City does not dispute that plaintiffs’ efforts\ninvolving rallies, marches, distribution of literature, displaying\nsigns and posters, and engaging in conversations regarding the\ntopics  which  prompted  the  “occupation”  are  matters  of  public\nconcern and are well within the protection of the First Amendment.\nMore problematic is the claim to First Amendment protection\nfor what are essentially sleeping and camping activities.  At oral\nargument, counsel for plaintiffs described the current conduct in\nCentennial Park as setting up 10-12 tents, with four or five people\nstaying within the tents twenty-four hours a day and the remaining\nparticipants “rotating” in and out.  The participants eat food\nbrought in by others, but do not cook food at the location.  No\nfixed numbers of people or fixed duration of the occupation have\never been specified, so this description appears to be inherently\nfluid.  The City argues that this type of conduct, even if confined\nto that described currently, is outside the protection of the First\nAmendment.\n-11-\n\nPlaintiffs view their “occupation” as symbolic expression, and\nas such protected by the First Amendment.  “[T]he First Amendment\nprotects symbolic conduct as well as pure speech.”  Virginia v.\nBlack, 538 U.S. 343, 360 n.2 (2003).  Symbolic expression delivers\na message by conduct that is intended to be communicative and that,\nin context, would reasonably be understood by the viewer to be\ncommunicative.  Clark, 468 U.S. at 294.  The Eleventh Circuit has\nfound that sleeping out-of-doors is not a fundamental right per se, \nJoel v. City of Orlando, 232 F.3d 1353, 1357 (11th Cir. 2000), and\nthe First Circuit has stated that “[t]he act of sleeping in a\npublic  place,  absent  expressive  content,  is  not\nconstitutionally-protected conduct.”   Whiting v. Westerly, 942\nF.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1991).  Most courts have assumed, without\ndeciding, that sleeping and/or camping could be expressive conduct\nunder appropriate circumstances.  Thus, in Clark, the Supreme Court\nassumed without deciding that overnight sleeping in a public park\nwas expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment.  468 U.S.\nat 293.  See also Gilbert, 920 F.2d at 883-84 (expressing “doubts”\nthat  sleeping  was  entitled  to  First  Amendment  protection,  but\nassuming it was); Hershey v. Clearwater, 834 F.2d 937, 940 (11th\nCir. 1987)(assuming that sleeping can be expressive conduct); Stone\nv. Agnos, 960 F.2d 893, 895 (9th Cir. 1992)(“Although sleeping\n-12-\n\nwould seem to be the antithesis of speaking, we need not determine\nwhether Stone's conduct was a form of expression.”)3  \nThe Court finds that in the context of this case the tenting\nand sleeping in the park as described by plaintiffs’ counsel is\nsymbolic conduct which is protected by the First Amendment.  The\nconduct of tenting and sleeping in the park 24 hours a day to\nsimulate an “occupation” is intended to be communicative and in\ncontext is reasonably understood by the viewer to be communicative. \nThis  expressive  conduct  relates  to  matters  of  public  concern\nbecause it can be fairly considered as relating to matters of\npolitical, social, or other concern to the community and is a\nsubject  of  general  interest  and  of  value  and  concern  to  the\npublic.4\nAt  oral  argument,  the  City  asserted  that  plaintiffs  are\nengaging in commercial speech by soliciting donations of money,\nfood, and supplies.  Assuming this is factually correct, which\nseems likely, such conduct would also fall within the protection of\nthe  First  Amendment,  although  subject  to  different  standards. \nSorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653 (2011); Milavetz,\n3Such an assumption only works, of course, if the ordinance is\nlater found to be constitutional.  If the ordinance is later found\nunconstitutional,  a  court  is  forced  to  actually  resolve  the\nthreshold issue. \n4While the conduct may change over time, the Court addresses\nonly the current conduct of plaintiffs.  Changed conduct can be\naddressed if and as it occurs. \n-13-\n\nGallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 1339-40\n(2010).\nAccordingly, the Court finds for purposes of the motion for a\npreliminary injunction that all the current conduct by plaintiffs\nat  issue  in  this  case  is  within  the  protection  of  the  First\nAmendment.  Having done so, “[t]he validity of restrictions on\nprotected  First  Amendment  expression  depends  upon  the  type  of\nspeech and the type of forum being regulated.”  Gold Coast Publ’ns,\nInc., 42 F.3d at 1344; Thomas v. Howze, 348 F.App’x 474, 477 (11th\nCir. 2009). The Court addresses these matters in reverse order.  \n(4)  Is Centennial Park a Public Forum:  \nThe second step is to determine the type of forum in which the\nspeech is taking place.  The Supreme Court has recognized a  “forum\nbased” approach for assessing the validity of restrictions placed\non the use of government property.  \nUnder this approach, regulation of speech on government\nproperty that has traditionally been available for public\nexpression  is  subject  to  the  highest  scrutiny.  Such\nregulations survive only if they are narrowly drawn to\nachieve a compelling state interest.  The second category\nof  public  property  is  the  designated  public  forum,\nwhether of a limited or unlimited character-property that\nthe State has opened for expressive activity by part or\nall  of  the  public.    Regulation  of  such  property  is\nsubject  to  the  same  limitations  as  that  governing  a\ntraditional  public  forum.    Finally,  there  is  all\nremaining  public  property.  Limitations  on  expressive\nactivity conducted on this last category of property must\nsurvive only a much more limited review. The challenged\nregulation  need  only  be  reasonable,  as  long  as  the\nregulation is not an effort to suppress the speaker's\nactivity due to disagreement with the speaker's view. \n-14-\n\nKrishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 679.  \nA public park is among those venues which have historically\nbeen considered public forums closely associated with the free\nexercise of expressive activities.  In Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496,\n515, 516 (1939) the Court found that “streets and parks . . . have\nimmemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time\nout of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating\nthoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.”  Since\nthen, numerous cases have referred to public parks as being public\nforums within the meaning of the First Amendment.  E.g., Amnesty\nInt’l, USA v. Battle, 559 F.3d 1170, 1182 (11th Cir. 2009)(“Amnesty\nalso has a constitutional right to engage in peaceful protest on\npublic land, such as in a city park.”); Naturist Soc’y, Inc. v.\nFillyaw, 958 F.2d 1515, 1521-23 (11th Cir. 1992)(same).  \nCentennial Park is a City-owned and operated park in downtown\nFort Myers bordered by the Caloosahatchee River on one side and\nseveral side streets on the other sides.  The City concedes, and\nthe Court agrees, that Centennial Park is a public forum for First\nAmendment purposes.\n(5) Standards for Justification of Restrictions: \nFinding all the conduct is protected by the First Amendment\nand  that  Centennial  Park  is  a  public  forum  “only  begins  the\ninquiry.”  Clark, 468 U.S. at 293; Black, 538 U.S. at 361.  “Even\nthe prohibition against content discrimination that we assert the\n-15-\n\nFirst Amendment requires is not absolute.”  R.A.V. v. City of St.\nPaul, 505 U.S. 377, 387 (1992).  See also Snyder, 131 S. Ct. at\n1218 (“Even protected speech is not equally permissible in all\nplaces and at all times.”); Bloedorn, 631 F.3d at 1230 (“It is by\nnow clear that the First Amendment does not guarantee access to\nproperty just because it is owned by the government.”); Naturist\nSoc’y, 958 F.2d at 1523 (“Even though [the park] is a public forum,\nthe Naturists are not free to exercise First Amendment rights in\nany way they see fit.”)  Rather, conduct protected by the First\nAmendment  is  “subject  to  reasonable  time,  place,  or  manner\nrestrictions that are consistent with the standards announced in\nthis Court's precedents.”  Snyder, 131 S. Ct. at 1218, citing\nClark, 468 U.S. at 293.  See also First Vagabonds Church of God v.\nCity of Orlando, Fla., 638 F.3d 756,761 (11th Cir. 2011)(en banc). \nThe “standards announced in this Court’s precedents,”  Snyder, 131\nS. Ct. at 1218, depend largely on whether the restrictions on the\nactivities are content-based or content-neutral.  Solantic, LLC v.\nCity of Neptune Beach, 410 F.3d 1250, 1258 (11th Cir. 2005).\n(a) Content-Neutral Restrictions:\nContent neutral restrictions on conduct protected by the First\nAmendment  in  a  public  forum  are  proper  if  “they  are  narrowly\ntailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and [ ] they\nleave open ample alternative channels for communication of the\ninformation.”  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791\n-16-\n\n(1989) quoting Clark, 468 U.S. at 293 (internal citations omitted). \nSee also Snyder, 131 S. Ct. at 1218; Amnesty Int’l, 559 F.3d at\n1182.  Symbolic expression “may be forbidden or regulated if the\nconduct itself may constitutionally be regulated, if the regulation\nis narrowly drawn to further a substantial governmental interest,\nand  if  the  interest  is  unrelated  to  the  suppression  of  free\nspeech.”  Ward, 468 U.S. at 294.\nTo determine whether an ordinance is content-neutral, a court\ngenerally  looks  to  the  terms  of  the  ordinance  to  see  if  the\nordinance “distinguish[es] favored speech from disfavored speech on\nthe basis of the ideas or views expressed.”  Solantic, 410 F.3d at\n1259 and n.8, quoting Turner Broad. Sys., v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 643\n(1994).  If content neutral, the government restriction:\nneed not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of\ndoing  so.  Rather,  the  requirement  of  narrow  tailoring  is\nsatisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial\ngovernment interest that would be achieved less effectively\nabsent the regulation.  To be sure, this standard does not\nmean  that  a  time,  place,  or  manner  regulation  may  burden\nsubstantially more speech than is necessary to further the\ngovernment's  legitimate  interests.    Government  may  not\nregulate  expression  in  such  a  manner  that  a  substantial\nportion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its\ngoals.  So  long  as  the  means  chosen  are  not  substantially\nbroader than necessary to achieve the government's interest,\nhowever, the regulation will not be invalid simply because a\ncourt  concludes  that  the  government's  interest  could  be\nadequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative. \nThe validity of time, place, or manner regulations does not\nturn on a judge's agreement with the responsible decision\nmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting\nsignificant government interests or the degree to which those\ninterests should be promoted.\n-17-\n\nWard, 491 U.S. at 798-99.  “To demonstrate the significance of its\ninterest, the City is not required to present detailed evidence. .\n.,[but] is entitled to advance its interests by arguments based on\nappeals to common sense and logic.”  Coalition for the Abolition of\nMarijuana Prohibition v. City of Atlanta, 219 F.3d 1301, 1318 (11th\nCir.  2000)(citations  omitted.)    To  establish  an  ordinance  is\nnarrowly tailored, the Court must determine whether there is a\n“reasonable  fit”  between  the  governmental  interests  and  the \nordinance.  Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, 507 U.S. 410, 416\n(1993).    See  also  Coalition  for  the  Abolition  of  Marijuana\nProhibition, 219 F.3d at 1318; International Caucus of Labor Comms.\nv.  City  of  Montgomery,  111  F.3d  1548,  1551  (11th  Cir.  1997). \nFinally, a content-neutral restriction must allow ample alternative\nchannels of communication.  The City can satisfy this requirement\neven if the other channels may be less effective than plaintiffs\nwould  prefer.    Coalition  for  the  Abolition  of  Marijuana\nProhibition, 219 F.3d at 1319.   \n(b) Content-Based Restrictions:\nContent-based restrictions on conduct protected by the First\nAmendment require heightened judicial scrutiny.  Sorrell, 131 S.\nCt.  at  2653.    Content-based  restrictions  are  found  where  the\nstatute’s prohibition is “directed only at works with a specified\ncontent.”  Simon & Schuster, Inc. V. N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,\n502  U.S.  622,  643  (1994).    A  content-based  regulation  is\n-18-\n\npresumptively invalid, and the government has the burden to rebut\nthat presumption.  United States v. Stevens, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 1584\n(2010); DA Mortg., 486 F.3d at 1266 n.8.  With a content-based\nrestriction, the government must show: (1) that the regulation is\nnecessary  to  serve  a  compelling  state  interest;  and  (2)  that\nregulation is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.  Boos v. Barry,\n485 U.S. 321, 321-22 (1988).  \nIn sum, if restrictions on conduct protected by the First\nAmendment in a public forum are content neutral, they are lawful\nif: (1) there is a significant governmental interest in restricting\nthe conduct; (2) the restriction is narrowly tailored to achieve\nthat government interest; and (3) the restriction leaves open ample\nalternative channels for protected expression.  If, on the other\nhand, restrictions on conduct protected by the First Amendment in\na public forum are content based, they are lawful if: (1) there is\na  compelling  governmental  interest;  (2)  the  restriction  is\nnecessary  to  serve  that  interest;  and  (3)  the  restriction  is\nnarrowly drawn to achieve the interest.  \n(6) The Challenged Ordinances:\nAs  the  Complaint  states,  and  as  counsel  for  plaintiffs\nconfirmed  at  the  oral  argument,  all  four  counts  are  facial\nchallenges to the City ordinances.  \nA facial challenge, as distinguished from an as-applied\nchallenge, seeks to invalidate a statute or regulation\nitself.  And, when a plaintiff mounts a facial challenge\nto  a  statute  or  regulation,  the  plaintiff  bears  the\n-19-\n\nburden of proving that the law could never be applied in\na constitutional manner. This is because a party who\nasserts a facial challenge to a statute is seeking not\nonly  to  vindicate  his  own  rights,  but  also  those  of\nothers who may be adversely impacted by the statute. \nDA Mortg., 486 F.3d at 1262 (internal citations and punctuation\nomitted).  See also Jacobs v. The Fla. Bar, 50 F.3d 901, 906 n.20\n(11th Cir. 1995). \n(a) Ordinance 2-273:\nPlaintiffs challenge Ordinances 2-271 to 273, entitled the\n“Special Events Advisory Board” Ordinance, as “unconstitutional on\nits face as an impermissible prior restraint, containing terms\nwhich provide for targeted regulation of core political speech\nwhile  allowing  unbridled  discretion  in  the  Board  to  provide\nexemption of permit requirements for commercial speech.”  (Doc. #1, \nCount One, ¶46).  Plaintiffs also allege that this ordinance “is\nunconstitutional on its face as an impermissible prior restraint,\ncontaining terms which provide for targeted regulation of core\npolitical speech while allowing unbridled discretion in the Board\nto provide exemption of permit requirements for commercial speech.” \n(Doc. #1, Count Two, ¶54.)  The motion for a preliminary injunction\nonly seeks to enjoin the enforcement of Ordinance 2-273.  (Doc.\n#10, p. 2, ¶2.) \nThe Special Events Advisory Board Ordinance, a copy of which\nis attached to the Complaint, creates a Special Events Advisory\nBoard and provides it with the following powers and duties:  \n-20-\n\nThe special events advisory board shall:\n(1) Act in an advisory capacity to the city council in\nmatters  relating to special events proposed by event\nmanagers, which are:\na. Open to the public\nb. Held  within  the  city  limits  in  spaces\nwhich are overseen by the city;\nc. Expected  to  attract  more  than  1,000\npeople; and \nd. Requesting the city council approve a waiver\nor a reduction of fees or a cash sponsorship;\n(2) Endeavor to facilitate quality cultural and artistic\nevents that enhance the quality of life for the citizens\nof the city, and provide exposure and positive social and\neconomic impacts for the city, by either recommending or\nwithholding recommendation of funding to the city council\nfor  a  special  event  that  meets  the  four  criteria\ndescribed in (1) of this section, based on a competitive\nprocess;\n(3) Recommend to the city council special events that\nshould receive city sponsorship by a reduction or waiver\nin the fees charged for the use of public property and/or\nthe cost of services to be provided by the city, based on\na weighted scale of merit;\n(4)  Recommend regulations for  the  conduct of special\nevents  that  will  increase  interest  therein  to  the\ncitizens, residents and visitors of the city generally,\ninsofar as the same are not in conflict with the city\nCode and state statutes;\n(5) Have such other advisory duties granted by the city\ncouncil consistent with successful special events held\nwithin the city.\nFort Myers, Fla. City Ordinance § 2-273.\nIt is clear, as the City stated at oral argument, that this\nordinance creates a content-based advisory group.  The very purpose\nof  the  Special  Events  Advisory  Board  is  to  form  content-based\n-21-\n\nopinions  and  make  content-based  recommendations  to  the  City\nCouncil.  \nThe  ordinance  is  not  a  violation  of  the  First  Amendment,\nhowever,  because  the  ordinance  gives  the  Board  no  power  to\nimplement any of its recommendations.  “A municipal governing body\nmay be held liable for acts or policies of individuals to whom it\ndelegated final decision making authority in a particular area. A\nmember or employee of a governing body is a final policy maker only\nif his decisions have legal effect without further action by the\ngoverning body.”  Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1291-92 (11th\nCir. 2004)(citations omitted).  Plaintiffs have failed to establish\na substantial likelihood that Ordinances §§ 2-271 to 2-273 are\nunconstitutional  on  their  face  as  a  violation  of  the  First\nAmendment.  Accordingly, the request for a preliminary injunction\nas to these ordinances is denied.\nThe Court recognizes that the pamphlet given to Occupy Fort\nMyers (Doc. #30, p. 5) states:  “The Special Event Advisory Board\nmay have final approval of all events as detailed in City Ordinance\n#3019.”  Neither party has provided the Court with Ordinance #3019,\nand the Court has been unable to find such an ordinance.  In any\nevent,  the  challenged  ordinances  simply  do  not  contain  such\nauthority.  Therefore, the facial challenge to the ordinance is\nunlikely to succeed.\n-22-\n\n(b) Ordinance 86-153:\nPlaintiffs challenge Ordinance 86-153, entitled the “Parades\nand Processions” Ordinance, which requires a City permit from the\npolice  department  prior  to  parades  or  processions  on  any  city\nstreet and any open air public meeting on any public property. \nPlaintiffs allege that this ordinance “is unconstitutional on its\nface as an impermissible prior restraint, containing terms which\nprovide for targeted regulation of core political speech while\nallowing  unbridled  discretion  in  the  Chief  of  Police  to  show\npreference of non-political speech.”  (Doc. #1, Count Two, ¶55.) \nPlaintiffs also challenge this ordinance as vague (Count Three) and\na violation of their liberty interests (Count Four).    \nSection 86-153 states in relevant part:\n(a) No  parade  or  procession  upon  any  street  of  the\ncity,  and  no  open-air  public  meeting  upon  any\npublic property shall be permitted unless a special\npermit  shall  first  be  obtained.    Any  person\ndesiring a permit under this  section shall make\nwritten application to the chief of police or some\nduly authorized member of the police department. \nPermits issued under this section shall be printed\nor written, duly signed by the chief of police or\nsome  duly  authorized  member  of  the  police\ndepartment after approval, and shall specify the\nday,  hour,  place  and  purpose  of  such  parade,\nprocession or open-air public meeting.\nFort Myers, Fla. Ordinance § 86-153(a).  \nThe City has not responded to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims\nas to this ordinance.  Rather, the City asserts that it does not\nenforce  this  ordinance,  and  it  did  not  enforce  this  ordinance\n-23-\n\nagainst plaintiffs, thus rendering the claim moot.  The City’s\nargument  is  based  on  the  following:    On  November  9,  2004,  an\nunrelated group of plaintiffs filed a Complaint in Case No. 2:04-\ncv-551 challenging this and other City of Fort Myers ordinances\nunder the First Amendment.  On December 13, 2004, the City Council\nissued  Resolution  No.  2004-74  abating  enforcement  of  these\nordinances until the lawsuit could be evaluated.  (Doc. #28, p.\n16).  On December 21, 2004, the undersigned entered a Consent\nJudgment and Order (Doc. #33, Case No. 2:04-cv-551) at the request\nof the parties.  This Consent Judgment and Order noted that the\nCity  agreed  to  repeal  certain  sections  of  the  Parades  and\nProcessions ordinance and not to enforce them against plaintiffs\n“and those similarly situated.”  The Court then ordered the City\nand  its  employees  not  to  enforce  the  ordinance  against  those\nplaintiffs “and those similarly situated,” noting again that the\nCity had agreed to repeal the ordinances.  \nThe City now reports that the ordinance was not repealed. \nIndeed, in 2006 it was re-promulgated under the current number. \nThe City and its Chief of Police assert that despite its presence\non the books, it was not enforced as to plaintiffs in this case. \nThe City has also produced two letters in which it told citizens\nthat a permit was not required.  (Doc. #28).  \nUnder these facts it would be virtually impossible to find the\nissues moot.  The City told this Court almost seven years ago that\n-24-\n\nthe ordinance would be repealed.  Not only did the City not repeal\nthe  ordinance,  it  re-enacted  it  in  2006.    Plaintiffs  are  not\nrequired to rely upon the City’s representations that it will not\nenforce the ordinance as to them.  “The whim, self restraint, or\neven the well reasoned judgment of a government official cannot\nserve as the lone safeguard for First Amendment rights.”  Florida\nCannabis Action Network, Inc. v. City of Jacksonville, 130 F.Supp.\n2d 1358, 1362 (M.D. Fla. 2001).  \nAfter oral argument, the City filed a Notice of Filing (Doc.\n#35) attaching a Proposed Emergency Ordinance to be considered by\nthe City Council on November 7, 2011.  This emergency ordinance\nwould  finally  repeal  these  ordinances.    “Generally  when  an\nordinance is repealed any challenges to the constitutionality of\nthat  ordinance  become  moot.”    Coalition  for  the  Abolition  of\nMarijuana Prohibition, 219 F.3d at 1310.  If damages are properly\nrecoverable, however, the case may proceed despite the repeal.  In\nthis case, plaintiffs seek compensatory damages (Doc. #1, p. 20),\nbut such monetary damages are precluded as a matter of law in their\nfacial challenge.  DA Mortg., 486 F.3d at 1260 and cases cited\ntherein.    A  repeal  followed  by  a  superceding  amendment  to  an\nordinance usually, Covenant Christian Ministries, Inc. v. City of\nMarietta, 654 F.3d 1231, 1239 (11th Cir. 2011), but not always,\nHorton v. City of St. Augustine, 272 F.3d 1318, 1326 (11th Cir.\n2001)(citing cases), moots a request for injunctive relief.  While\n-25-\n\nvoluntary cessation of conduct by a government agency is entitled\nto a rebuttable presumption that the objectionable behavior will\nnot recur, Nat’l Ass’n of Bds. of Pharm. v. Bd. of Regents, 633\nF.3d 1297, 1310 (11th Cir. 2011), the past conduct of the City of\nFort Myers regarding this ordinance would certainly test such a\npresumption.    The  Court  need  not  resolve  that  issue,  however,\nbecause there is no record evidence that the City repealed the\nordinance.  \nAccordingly, the Court must determine whether plaintiffs have\na  substantial  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  as  to  the\nconstitutionality of this ordinance.  Plaintiffs contend that the\nsubject  ordinance  is  unconstitutional  because  it  is  a  prior\nrestraint on First Amendment speech.  The Court agrees.\nPrior restraints are presumptively unconstitutional and face\nstrict  scrutiny.    Burk,  365  F.3d  at  1251;  United  States  v.\nFrandsen,  212  F.3d  1231,  1236-37  (11th  Cir.  2000);  Church  of\nScientology Flag Serv. v. City of Clearwater, 2 F.3d 1514, 1547-48\n(11th Cir. 1993).  It is clear that a parade or procession on a\ncity street or an open-air public meeting on public property is\nconduct protected by the First Amendment.  Both streets and public\nparks are traditional public forums.  Although the ordinance is\ncontent-neutral, it does not serve as a valid time, place, and\nmanner restriction.  There has been no showing of a significant\ngovernmental  interest  in  requiring  a  police  permit  before  any\n-26-\n\nparade or procession on a public street or before any open-air\npublic.    Additionally,  there  has  been  no  showing  that  the\nrestriction is narrowly tailored to achieve a significant public\ninterest,  or  that  ample  alternative  channels  for  protected\nexpression exist.  As such, the ordinance does not survive strict\nscrutiny.  Therefore, plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial\nlikelihood  of  succeeding  on  the  merits  as  to  the\nunconstitutionality of this ordinance.  \n(c) Ordinance Section 58-156: \nPlaintiffs  challenge  Ordinance  58-156,  entitled  the  “Park\nRegulation”  Ordinance,  as  “unconstitutional  on  its  face  as  an\nimpermissible prior restraint, containing terms which provide for\ntargeted regulation of core political speech while allowing the\nRecreation Manager to make accommodations by extending park hours\nfor sporting, cultural or civil events.” (Doc. #1,  Count One,\n¶47).  Plaintiffs also allege that this ordinance is overbroad. \n(Doc.  #1,  Count  Two).    At  oral  argument,  plaintiffs’  counsel\nidentified § 58-156(a) as the specific provision being challenged. \nThis provision states:\nExcept  for  unusual  and  unforeseen  emergencies,  parks\nshall be open to the public every day of the year during\ndesignated hours. The opening and closing hours shall be\nposted for public information.  Normal park hours are\n6:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. unless posted otherwise by the\nrecreation manager. Such hours shall be deemed extended\nby the recreation manager as necessary to accommodate\nathletic sports events, or cultural or civic activities.\n \nFort Myers, Fl., Code of Ordinances § 58-156(a). \n-27-\n\nAt oral argument, plaintiffs’ counsel advised that plaintiffs\ndo not contend a public park has to be open twenty-four hours a\nday, and were not challenging the hours of operation set forth in\nthe ordinance.  Rather, plaintiffs challenge the portion of the\nordinance providing for extended hours, specifically the sentence\nstating:  “Such hours shall be deemed extended by the recreation\nmanager as necessary to accommodate athletic sports events, or\ncultural or civic activities.”  Plaintiffs argue that this is a\ncontent-based provision which gives unbridled discretion to the\nrecreation  manager  and  thus  on  its  face  violates  the  First\nAmendment.\nThe  City  responds  that  the  ordinance  is  content-neutral\nbecause the park hours apply equally to everyone, and the fact that\nthe hours can be extended does not render it content-based.  The\nCity argues that not only has it interpreted the phrase “civic\nactivities” to include plaintiffs’ protest activities, but that\n“civic activities” is interpreted by the City to simply relate to\nactivities by its citizens, and therefore effectively means any\nactivities.\nThe Court declines to read the ordinance in such a way as to\nrender  the  phrase  used  by  the  City  Council  to  be  effectively\nmeaningless.  Murray v. Mariner Health, 994 So. 2d 1051, 1061 (Fla.\n2008)(“A second relevant rule of statutory construction is that a\nstatutory provision will not be construed in such a way that it\n-28-\n\nrenders  meaningless or absurd any other statutory provision.”)\nMarket  Co.  v.  Hoffman,  101  U.S.  112,  115-16  (1879)(“It  is  a\ncardinal  rule  of  statutory  construction  that  significance  and\neffect shall, if possible, be accorded to every word.”); see also\nUnited States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 502 U.S. 30, 36 (1992).  The\nCity  has  cited  no  case  which  has  ever  interpreted  “civic\nactivities” in an ordinance to mean “any activities.”  The City\nwants the Court to interpret the sentence as if it was “Such hours\nshall be deemed extended by the recreation manager as necessary.” \nThis is not what the City Council wrote, and the City Council\npresumably  meant  something  when  it  restricted  the  recreation\nmanager to a necessary accommodation of only “sporting events, or\ncultural or civic activities.”  The Court finds that the plain\nlanguage  of  this  provision  requires  the  recreation  manager  to\nexamine the nature of the activity in making a decision to extend\npark  hours.    As  such,  this  provision  is  content-based,  and\ntherefore subject to strict scrutiny.\nIn  any  event,  the  last  sentence  of  this  provision  cannot\nwithstand either content-based or content-neutral scrutiny.  Under\na  strict  scrutiny  evaluation,  there  has  been  no  showing  of  a\ncompelling governmental interest in restricting the extension of\npark hours to only sporting events, cultural activities or civic\nactivities.  Even if content-neutral, there has been no showing of\na significant governmental interest in restricting the extension of\n-29-\n\npark hours to only sporting events, cultural activities or civic\nactivities,  and  no  showing  that  such  restriction  is  narrowly\ntailored.    The  Court  therefore  concludes  that  plaintiffs  are\nsubstantially  likely  to  prevail  on  their  claim  that  the  last\nsentence of this ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. \nThe Court need not enjoin enforcement of the entire ordinance\nwhen only a portion of that ordinance is likely unconstitutional. \nThe extension of park hours is wholly independent of the other\nprovisions in Ordinance § 58-156(a), and “a federal court should\nnot extend its invalidation of a statute further than necessary to\ndispose of the case before it.”  Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,\n472 U.S. 491, 503 (1985).  Additionally, the challenged ordinance\ncontains a severability clause5, and “[s]everability of a local\nordinance  is  a  question  of  state  law.”    Covenant  Christian\nMinistries v. City of Marietta, 654 F.3d 1231, 1240 (11th Cir.\n2011).  Severance is permissible because “the legislative purpose\n5Fort Myers, Fla. Code of Ordinances § 1-10 provides:\nIt is hereby declared to be the intention of the city\ncouncil that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses\nand  phrases  of  this  Code  are  severable,  and  if  any\nphrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this\nCode  shall  be declared unconstitutional by the valid\njudgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, such\nunconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining\nphrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of\nthis Code, since the same would have been enacted by the\ncity council without the incorporation in this Code of\nany  such  unconstitutional  phrase,  clause,  sentence,\nparagraph, or section.\n-30-\n\nexpressed in the valid provisions can be accomplished independently\nof those [provisions] which are void . . . .”  Presbyterian Homes\nof Synod v. Wood, 297 So. 2d 556, 559 (Fla. 1974).  Plaintiffs do\nnot contest the first part of the ordinance which provides for\nnightly closure of Fort Myers’s City parks.  The general intent of\nthe City Council’s desire to close the parks at night will remain\naccomplished if the provision providing for extensions of park\ntimes is severed.  Accordingly, the Court will enjoin the City from\nenforcing only the last sentence of this ordinance.\n(d) Ordinance 58-153(3): \nPlaintiffs allege that ordinance § 58-153 is impermissibly\nvague  on  its  face  (Doc.  #1,  Count  Three).    At  oral  argument,\nplaintiffs’  counsel  identified  §  58-153(3)  as  the  specific\nprovision being challenged. Section 58-153(3) states: \nNo unauthorized person in a park shall: Set up tents,\nshacks, or any other temporary shelters for the purpose\nof overnight camping. No person shall live in a park\nbeyond closing hours in any movable structure or special\nvehicle to be used or that could be used for such camping\npurpose, such as a tent, house-trailer, camp-trailer,\ncamp-wagon or the like. \nFort Myers, Fl., Code of Ordinances §  58-153(3).  Plaintiffs argue\nthis ordinance fails to provide notice of what precise conduct it\nprohibits and authorizes arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement \ndue to its lack of precision.  (Doc. #1, Count Three).  \nAn ordinance is  void on its face if it is so vague that\npersons  “of  common  intelligence  must  necessarily  guess  at  its\n-31-\n\nmeaning  and  differ  as  to  its  application.”    Connally  v.  Gen.\nConstr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926).  A plaintiff asserting that\na statute is void for vagueness must show either: (1) the statute\nfails to give fair notice of wrongdoing; or (2) the statute lacks\nenforcement  standards  such  that  it  might  lead  to  arbitrary  or\ndiscriminatory enforcement.  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S.\n104, 108-09 (1972).  “[T]he Constitution demands a high level of\nclarity from a law if it threatens to inhibit the exercise of a\nconstitutionally protected right, such as the right of free speech\nor religion.”  Konikov v. Orange Cnty., Fla., 410 F.3d 1317, 1329\n(11th  Cir.  2005).    In  the  context  of  a  facial  challenge,  the\nEleventh Circuit has recently stated:\nIn  bringing  a  facial  challenge  to  an  ordinance  for\nvagueness, a party “‘who engages in some conduct that is\nclearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of\nthe law as applied to the conduct of others.’”  Holder v.\nHumanitarian Law Project, –– U.S. ––, 130 S. Ct. 2705,\n2719, 177 L. Ed. 2d 355 (2010) (quoting Vill. of Hoffman\nEstates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489,\n102 S. Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1982)) . . . If\nPlaintiffs'  own  conduct is  clearly proscribed by the\nterms of the ordinance, this “necessarily precludes a\nfinding of facial vagueness.” High Ol' Times, Inc. v.\nBusbee, 673 F.2d 1225, 1228 (11th Cir. 1982).\nCatron v. City of St. Petersburg, 658 F.3d 1260(11th Cir. 2011). \nIf  the  conduct  is  not  clearly  proscribed  by  the  terms  of  the\nordinance, the court “must decide whether ‘what the ordinance as a\nwhole  prohibits  .  .  .  in  the  vast  majority  of  its  intended\napplications’ is clear enough.”  Id., citing  Hill v. Colorado, 530\nU.S. 703 (2000) (quotations and citations omitted)).  \n-32-\n\nPlaintiffs  have  not  shown  that  this  ordinance  is\nunconstitutionally vague on its face as to the conduct they are\nchallenging.  By the express terms of the ordinance, it is clear to\nthe public that it may not set up tents, shacks, or other temporary\nshelters to camp in the park overnight, and may not live in the\npark beyond closing hours in any movable structure or vehicle. \nPersons of ordinary intelligence are not left to guess at what\nconduct is prohibited, and the ordinance does not create the risk\nof arbitrary application.   Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate\na substantial likelihood of succeeding on their facial attack of\nthis ordinance, and a preliminary injunction as to it will be\ndenied.\n(e) Ordinance 58-154(6): \nPlaintiffs  challenge  Ordinance  58-154(6)  as  vague  and  as\nviolating their liberty interests under the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment on its face.  (Doc. #1, Count Four). \nSection 58-154(6) states that unauthorized persons in a park are\nprohibited from: \n(6) Loitering and boisterousness.  Sleep or protractedly\nlounge on the seats, benches, or other areas, or engage\nin loud, boisterous, threatening, abusive, insulting or\nindecent language, or engage in any disorderly conduct or\nbehavior tending to a breach of the public peace.\nFort Myers, Fl., Code of Ordinances §  58-154 (6). Plaintiffs argue\nthat this provision is vague because it creates uncertainty as to\nthe  type  of  loitering  or  boisterous  behavior  which  would  be\n-33-\n\nconsidered offensive conduct, and which conduct would fall within\nthe  “sweep”  of  the  ordinance.    (Doc.  #10,  p.  18.)    Further,\nplaintiffs contend that they have liberty interests in lounging on\npublic benches and public places “according to their inclination”\nand in meeting with others in open air within City limits.  (Doc.\n#1, Count Four).  \nIn response, defendants contend that a preliminary injunction\nshould be denied because no arrests have been made pursuant to this\nordinance, no arrests have been threatened, and plaintiffs have now\nacquired a permit which allows them to be in the park.  Defendants\nalso  argue  that  the  ordinance  only  applies  to  “unauthorized\npersons,” and plaintiffs’ presence in the park is “authorized” by\nits permit.  Defendant argues that the request for a preliminary\ninjunction as to this ordinance is therefore moot, plaintiffs lack\nstanding, and the issue is not ripe for review.  Alternatively,\ndefendant contends that any offending language should be severed\nrather than enjoining the entire ordinance.  In support, defendants\nprovided an affidavit of Mike Viola, Captain of the Fort Myers\nPolice Department.  (Doc. # 42-1.) \nThe crux of defendant’s argument is that because plaintiffs\nhave not been charged with any violations of this ordinance, and\nbecause the City does not intend to enforce this ordinance against\nplaintiff, there is no imminent fear of injury and therefore no\nactual  case  or  controversy.    This  argument  is  without  merit. \n-34-\n\nCaptain  Viola’s  affidavit  simply  states  that,  “[d]ue  to  the\nissuance of the [permit], enforcement of §58-154(6) is unlikely.” \n(Doc. # 42-1, p. 2)(emphasis added).  Thus, the City has not ruled\nout  enforcement  of  this  ordinance  against  plaintiffs. \nAdditionally, the City permit is revocable without cause with ten\ndays notice.  As such, the Court finds that there remains a case or\ncontroversy which is ripe and not moot for which plaintiffs have\nstanding. \n(1) Vagueness:\nApplying the vagueness principles set forth above, the Court\nfinds that a portion of this ordinance is unconstitutionally vague. \nWhile the meaning of sleeping on seats, benches, and other areas is\nclear, there is no established meaning to “protractedly lounge”\nwhich would advise a person of ordinary intelligence when he or she\nwas required to vacate the seat, bench, or other area in a City\npark.  An “allcases” computer search revealed not a single case\nwhere the phrase “protractedly lounge” was ever used.  Because the\nordinance fails to define this crucial term, and it is not clear\nfrom  the  ordinance  as  a  whole  that  the  vast  majority  of  its\nintended  application  is  clear  enough,  it  is  likely  to  be\nunconstitutionally  vague  on  its  face.    Catron  v.  City  of  St.\nPetersburg, 658 F.3d 1260 (11th Cir. 2011); Easy Way of Lee Cnty.,\nInc. v. Lee Cnty., 674 So. 2d 863, 866 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d\n-35-\n\nDist. 1996)(county noise ordinance failed to define crucial terms\nand was therefore vague).  \nThe meanings and application of both “disorderly conduct” and\n“breach of the public peace” are well established under Florida\nlaw.  Fla. Stat. § 877.03; K.M.D. v. State, 69 So. 3d 311, 313 n.4\n(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 4th Dist. 2011); C.N. v. State, 49 So. 3d 831,\n832 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 5th Dist. 2003); Macon v. State, 854 So.\n2d 834, 837 n.1 (Fla. 5th DCA 2003).  Thus, this portion of the\nordinance  satisfies  notice  requirements.    On  the  other  hand,\n“behavior  tending  to”  breach  of  the  peace  has  no  established\nmeaning,  and  is  not  comprehensible  to  persons  of  ordinary\nintelligence.    Florida  interprets  it  laws  in  such  a  way  that\nconduct such as “loud, boisterous, threatening, abusive, insulting\nor indecent language” are limited by the First Amendment and as\nsuch are constitutional.  Macon, 854 So. 2d at 837 n.1.  In any\nevent, plaintiffs do not assert that their conduct was threatening,\nabusive, insulting, or indecent.\nIn sum, the Court finds that plaintiffs are likely to succeed\nonly  as  to  a  portion  of  their  challenge  to  this  ordinance. \nPlaintiffs  are  likely  to  succeed  as  to  the  provisions  which\nprohibits  “protracted  lounging”  and  conduct  “tending”  towards\nbreach of the public peace.  The Court will grant a preliminary\ninjunction as to these portions of the ordinance. \n-36-\n\n(2) Liberty Interests:\n“Plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected liberty interest\nto be in parks or on other city lands of their choosing that are\nopen to the public generally . . . Plaintiffs possess a private\nliberty interest in lawfully visiting city property that is open to\nthe public . . . .”  Catron, 658 F.3d 1260, at *7, 8, 12 (11th Cir.\n2011).    “All  Florida  citizens  have  a  right  under  the  Florida\nConstitution  to  ‘chat[  ]  on  a  public  street,’  ‘stroll[  ]\naimlessly,’ and ‘saunter down a sidewalk.’”  Catron, 658 F.3d at\n*20, 21, citing State v. J.P., 907 So. 2d 1101, 1113 (Fla. 2004),\n(quoting Wyche v. State, 619 So. 2d 231, 235 (Fla. 1993)).  This\nliberty interest does not include sleeping or camping in a public\npark, Joel, 232 F.3d at 1357, and in any event can be forfeited by\n“trespass or other violation of the law.”  Catron, 658 F.3d at *7,\n8, citing Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1345 (11th\nCir.  1994).    The  Court  concludes  that  plaintiffs  have  not\nestablished that they are likely to succeed on their claims to a\nfundamental right to lounge where, when, and for how long they wish\nin a public park or to meet in a public park during hours it is\nclosed  to  the  public.    The  preliminary  injunction  as  to  this\nordinance will therefore be denied as to the liberty claims.\nB. Irreparable Injury\nHaving  determined  that  plaintiffs  have  demonstrated  a\nsubstantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits as to their\n-37-\n\nconstitutional challenges of Ordinances 86-153 and portions of 58-\n156, and 58-154(6), the Court turns to the remaining factors for\nthe issuance of a preliminary injunction. \n“A  showing  of  irreparable  injury  is  the  sine  qua  non  of\ninjunctive relief.”  Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176 (quoting Northeastern\nFla. Chapter of Ass’n of General Contractors v. Jacksonville, 896\nF.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. 1990) (internal quotations omitted)). \n“Regarding irreparable injury, it is well established that the loss\nof First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,\nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  KH Outdoor, LLC v.\nTrussville, 458 F.3d 1261, 1271-72 (11th Cir. 2006) (citations and\ninternal punctuation omitted).  The nature of the injuries in this\ncase flowing from the portions of the ordinances which the Court\nhas found to be in likely violation of the First Amendment are such\nthat they cannot be cured by the award of monetary damages.  The\nCourt finds that plaintiffs have satisfied their burden  to show\nirreparable injury stemming from these ordinances.\nC. Balance of Injuries, Public Interest\nPlaintiffs must also establish that the threatened injury to\nthem outweighs the harm a preliminary injunction may cause to the\ndefendant and that an injunction would not harm or do a disservice\nto the public interest.  Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d at 1176.  “As\nnoted, even a temporary infringement of First Amendment rights\nconstitutes a serious and substantial injury, and the city has no\n-38-\n\nlegitimate interest in enforcing an unconstitutional ordinance. For\nsimilar  reasons,  the  injunction  plainly  is  not  adverse  to  the\npublic  interest.  The  public  has  no  interest  in  enforcing  an\nunconstitutional ordinance.”  KH Outdoor, 458 F.3d at 1272.  Both\nfactors favor issuance of a preliminary injunction as to those\nportions of the ordinances the Court has found to likely violate\nthe First Amendment.\nD. Bond Requirement \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  because  they  seek  to  vindicate\nconstitutional rights they ought not be required to post security\nas a condition of the preliminary injunction, as otherwise required\nby Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).  Defendant opposes this\nrequest, contending that the City would incur substantial financial\ncosts should the Court enjoin the City from closing Centennial Park\nfrom 10:30 through 6:00 a.m. and the City will not be able to\nrecover the additional costs to the taxpayers from plaintiffs.\nRule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides\nthat a court “may issue a preliminary injunction . . . only if the\nmovant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper\nto pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have\nbeen wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  \n[B]efore  a  court  may  issue  a  preliminary\ninjunction, a bond must be posted, but it is\nwell-established that “the amount of security\nrequired by the rule is a matter within the\ndiscretion of the trial court . . . and the\n-39-\n\ncourt  may  elect  to  require  no  security  at\nall.”\nBellsouth Telecomm., Inc. V. MCI Metro Access Transmission Servs.,\nLLC,  425  F.3d  964,  971  (11th  Cir.  2005)  (internal  citations\nomitted).  Given the limited scope of the of the new matters in the\npreliminary injunction to be issued, the Court finds it appropriate\nto require a nominal $100 bond to be posted.   \nAccordingly, it is now \nORDERED:\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED IN\nPART AND DENIED IN PART as set forth above.  A separate preliminary\ninjunction will be entered.  \nDONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this   15th   day of\nNovember, 2011.\nCopies: Counsel of record\n-40-",

This action seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief and compensatory damages pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, for ongoing and threatened injury to the First Amendment rights of individuals and \nan unincorporated association engaged in lawful expressive activity within the City of Fort Myers, \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 2 of 21 PageID 2\nFlorida. This Court accordingly has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to 28 U .S.C. § 1331 \nas claims arising under the U.S. Constitution, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (a), as a civil action \nto redress the deprivation of civil rights and privileges secured by the U.S. Constitution.  Further, this \ncourt has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory relief in accordance with the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201 and 2202. \n2. Venue is proper in the Middle District of Florida-Fort Myers Division, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \n(1), insofar as defendant City of Fort Myers is located in Lee County, Florida, and is thereby wholly \nlocated within the above-referenced judicial district. \nINTRODUCTION \n3. The set of Plaintiffs is comprised of thirteen (13) persons who are active in Southwest Florida in \nbringing awareness of social and economic justice issues through demonstrations, marches, and \nrallies, and related expressive speech and conduc~ and one (1) unincorporated association whose \nmembers are concerned about current political, social and economic issues, including those arising \nlocally, nationally and globally. In the instant civil action, the Plaintiffs challenge several provisions \nof the City of Fort Myers' Municipal Code (\"Fort Myers Code\" or \"Code\").  The City of Fort \nMyers (hereinafter also \"Fort Myers\" or \"defendant City\") employs a penni t scheme, for expressive \nactivity in traditional public fora, that is violative of constitutional safeguards as an unlawful prior \nrestraint, because it is content-based, overbroad, vague, and it suffers from additional infinnities. \nThe pennit scheme requires a \"written pennit from the chief of police\" for every \"parade, procession \n... or public open-air meeting.\"  The ordinance lacks sufficient standards in multiple instances, to \nguide the decision of whether and under what conditions a permit will issue, to ensure that public \nofficials must decide whether to issue or deny a pennit in sufficient time to actually stage the event, \nand what conditions may be imposed on expressive activities.  The absence of adequate standards \nin key areas means that the ordinance vests public officials with unbridled discretion and invites \ncontent-based decisions based on the nature of the speaker. These are forbidden grounds on which \nPage 2 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 3 of 21 PageID 3\nto base a permit scheme that requires a license to engage in protected speech; the permit scheme \nviolates Plaintiffs'  First Amendment rights  by  impermissibly limiting their rights to  speech, \nassociation, and assembly.  Furthermore, the Fort Myers allows City officials to accommodate \n\"athletic sporting events, or cultural or civic events\" after public park closing hours, but allows no \nprovision for accommodation oft hose who are participating in First Amendment-protected activity. \nThis ordinance is content-based on its face and illustrates a governmental policy of preference for \nnon-political speech. For these reasons, defendant City of Fort Myers must be enjoined from \nprohibiting the lawful exercise of First Amendment-protected activity.  Further, the Plaintiffs seek \na declaration that the City'S \"Park Operating Policy\" is facially invalid as violative of protected \nexpressive conduct, and seeks damages for the wrongful abrogation of protected free speech, \nassociation and assembly. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n4.  Plaintiff OCCUpy FORT MYERS (\"alternately \"OFM\") is an unincorporated association of \nindividuals, mostly from Lee County, Florida and surrounding areas, who a re concerned about the \ndirection of our country and who have gathered spontaneously to bring visibility to the influence of \nprivate money into the nation's political process.

[Valo Decl., at ~16]. \nDefendant \n18.  Defendant CITY OF FORT MYERS is a body corporate and politic, with the capacity to sue \nand be sued.  The City of Fort Myers is the legal entity responsible for the actions of its final \npolicymaker for city policies, the Fort Myers City Council.  As such, defendant City is responsible \nfor the passage of City Code Sec. 2-271 to 2-273, Sec. 58-151 to 58-157, and Sec. 78-1 to 78-3 by \nthe City Council, and for the implementation of that city law. \nPage 6 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 7 of 21 PageID 7\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS \n19.  Plaintiffs seek to exercise their First Amendment rights to demonstrate in Centennial Park, \npublic property located in Fort Myers, Florida, in an attempt to bring visibility to the insidious \ninfluence of money into the U.S. political process, and to inform members ofthe general public on \npolitical issues such as social justice and economic equality. \nInteraction Between Event Organizers and City of Fort Myers Officials \n20. On or about October 11, 2011, Mark Hetrick, who volunteered his services as a member of the \nOFM Legal Working Team, called the Fort Myers Police Department (\"FMPD\") to inquire about \nobtaining a permit for a planned OFM rally and march in downtown Fort Myers on Oct. 15,2011. \n[Valo Decl., at ~6). \n21.  FMPD indicated that OFM could rally and march downtown on Oct. 15th, provided that OFM \nsubmit to certain restrictions. Specifically, OFM could not: use a megaphone, march in the street, \nor include \"vulgar language\" on signs.  [Valo Decl., at ~6]. \n22. Mr. Hetrick further inquired about OFM's intentions to symbolically \"occupy\" Centennial Park \nbeginning on the evening of Oct. 15, 2011.  An FMPD contact said that the police would not \ninterfere with any overnight \"occupation,\" including allowing the erection of tents, as long as there \nwas no alcohol brought into the park. The FMPD advised OFM to contact the City of Fort Myers \nRecreation Division to obtain a permit for the overnight occupation.  [Valo Decl., at ~6]. \n23.  On October 15, 2011, OFM held a noon rally at Centennial Park, and then conducted an \napproximately one mile-long march from Centennial Park to the Bank of America branch on First \nStreet, and then back to Centennial Park. Approximately 500 people showed up to support the \nOccupy Fort Myers movement. The march and rally remained peaceful and respectful. [Valo Decl., \nat ~6]. \nPage 7 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 8 of 21 PageID 8\n24.  OFM began \"occupying\" Centennial Park on the evening of October 15th The General \n• \nAssembly ofOFM, comprised oft he entire gathering ofp ersons engaged in a group decision-making \nprocess, agreed that the \"occupiers\" would respect the City and park by making sure that the \nparticipants maintained  quiet after park closing hours,  and  by thoroughly cleaning up  after \nthemselves. The occupiers had no confrontations with members of the public, the City or FMPD \nfrom Oct. 15th through Oct. 20th•  [Valo Decl., at ~9]. The \"occupiers\" did continue their political \nactivity by engaging in awareness-building with an information booth for questions for the general \npublic set up at the entranceway of the encampment, print and television media, by displaying \npolitical signs, and through the symbolic presence of tents. [Faulkner Decl., at ~ 3; see also digital \nphotographs of the OFM encampment area, attached hereto as Exhibit 5]. \n25.  On October 18, 2011, OFM obtained a \"Special Events\" pamphlet from the City, enclosed \nwithin it was a permitting scheme and a permit application. The \"Special Events\" pamphlet states \nthat \"[t]he Special Events Advisory Board may have final approval of all events as detailed in City \nOrdiance #30 19.\" OFM completed a permit application, and submitted it to the Recreation Division. \nOFM informed the Recreation Division, along with Officer Sanchez of the FMPD, through email \ncommunication that Occupy Fort Myers sought to cooperate with the City.  [Valo Decl., at ~1 0]. \n26.  On October 19,2011, at 10:19 a.m., Kelly MacDonald, Senior Program Coordinator in the \nRecreation Division informed OFM, through email, that, before the Special Event Committee could \neven review the permit application, OFM would need to obtain a $1 million liability insurance policy \nand bring the Liability Insurance certificate to the Recreation Administrative Office. Ms. MacDonald \ninformed OFM that the City was prepared to enforce Ordinance Sec. 58-153(3) if OFM did not \ncomply with the liability insurance by 3:00 p.m. on the same day.  [Valo Decl., at ~1O]. \n27.  On October 19,2011, Mark Hetrick contacted Ms. MacDonald by email and phone to let her \nknow that OFM could not possibly comply with the 3 :00 p.m. deadline to obtain an insurance policy. \nThe City gave OFM the names ofthree insurance companies, and Ms. MacDonald agreed to allow \nPage 8 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 9 of 21 PageID 9\nOFM an additional day to attempt to obtain insurance and thereby comply with City regulations. \n[Valo Decl., at ~10]. \n28.  On Oct. 19, 2011, OFM informed the City of Fort Myers Recreation Division and Police \nDepartment, through email, that the insurance companies designated by the City of Fort Myers would \nnot provide the requested liability insurance policy to OFM. OFM informed Ms. MacDonald, Mr. \nSaeed Kazemi, the Public Works Director, and Officer Sanchez of the FMPD, through email, that \nOFM sought understanding and cooperation with the City, that the group would like to obtain a \npermit, but OFM could not satisfy the City's requirements. OFM asked that the City not attempt to \ndismantle OFM presence in Centennial Park.  [Valo Decl., at ~11]. \n29.  Even if an insurer would agree to insure OFM, OFM has absolutely no funds with which to pay \nfor a liability insurance policy and, it was conveyed by City personnel that the City of Fort Myers \nwould require OFM to apply for another permit and obtain a re-issuance or new insurance policy \nevery ten days.  [Valo Decl., at ~14]. OFM sought to review the procedures for requesting a waiver \nof the liability insurance requirement or for appeal of the denial of a permit, but there were no \nprovisions for either to be found in either the City of Fort Myers ordinances or the Special Events \npamphlet.  [Valo Decl., at ~12]. \n30. On October 20,2011, members ofOFM and their legal counsel spent most of the day attempting \nto negotiate, in good faith, with City employees in an attempt to obtain a permit for the ongoing \nsymbolic demonstration. The City would not issue OFM a permit, nor would the City identify any \nprocedure for requesting either waiver or appeal of the City'S decision. [Valo Decl., at ~15]. \n31. On the evening of October 20, at approximately 10:45 p.m., members of the FMPD showed up \nat Centennial Park and issued citations of $135 each to any individual who was planning on \nremaining in the park after 10:30 p.m. [Valo Decl., at ~15; Faulkner Decl., at ~6; Ospina Decl., at \n~6]. \nPage 9 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 10 of 21 PageID 10\n32.  On the morning of October 22, 2011, FMPD law enforcement officers arrived at OFM \nencampment area at approximately 6:15 a.m. and demanded the OFM occupiers to leave the park \nand remove their tents. [McDowell Decl., at ~6]. \n33.  Humana, the insurance corporation, was sponsoring an Alzheimer's Awareness event in \nCentennial Park on Saturday, October 22. FMPD Captain Viola informed OFM occupiers that \nHumana rented \"the entire park,\" and that he didn't wish for OFM members to leave the park \ncompletely until noon. When Capt. Viola was further questioned by OFM members, he informed \nOFM that the Humana representatives did not want the tents in the park during their event. The \noccupiers who were present each received a citation in the amount of$135 for being in the park after \nclosing hours, even though Humana representatives were also in the park before 6:30 a.m. The \noccupiers who were present each received a citation in the amount of$135 for being in the park after \nclosing hours, even though Humana representatives were also  in  the park before 6:30 a.m. \n[McDowell Decl., at ~6]. \n34.  As a direct and proximate cause oft he unconstitutional City ordinances, Plaintiffs have suffered \ndamages, which include violation of their civil rights, limitation of their core political message to \nthose who may be interested in participating in OFM events but whose speech has been chilled, and \neconomic damages, in the nature of the value of the lost publicity, the value of volunteer staff time \nto adjust events and notify persons as to governmental harassment, the cost of transportation and \nrelated costs to attempt to comply with City demands, costs of litigation, and related expenses. \nCity of Fort Myers Ordinancesl \nProvision oft ile Special Events Advisory Board Ordinance, Sec. 2-273. \n35. The law, entitled \"Powers and Duties,\" is a sweeping set of provisions vesting specific powers \nwithin the Special Advisory Board, as follows: \nI. Copies of the Challenged City Code sections are attached hereto as Exhibit 6. \nPage 10 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 11 of 21 PageID 11\n\"The special events advisory board shall: \n(1) Act in an advisory capacity to the city council in matters relating to special events proposed by \nevent managers, which are Ca) Open to the public; (b) held within the city limits in spaces that are \noverseen by the city; © Expected to attract more than 1,000 people; and (d) Requesting the city \ncouncil approve a waiver or a reduction of fees or a cash sponsorship. \n(3) Recommend to the city council special events that should receive city sponsorship by a reduction \nor waiver in the fees charged for the use of public property and/or the cost of services to be provided \nby the city, based on a weighted scale of merit; \n(4) Recommend regulations for the conduct of special events that will increase interest therein to the \ncitizens, residents and visitors of the city generally ....\"  \nProvision oft l.e Park Operating Policy, Sec. 58. \n36. Sec. 58-153, entitled \"Recreational activity restrictions,\" and Sec. 58-154, entitled \"Prohibited \nBehavior,\" impose impermissibly vague restrictions on symbolic speech and expressive activity, as \nfollows: \n58-153 \"No unauthorized person in a park shall: (3)  Set up tents, shacks, or any other temporary \nshelters for the purpose of overnight camping. No person shall live in a park beyond closing hours \nin any movable structure or special vehicle to be used or that could be used for such camping purpose, \nsuch as a tent, house-trailer, camp-trailer, camp-wagon or the like.\" \n58-154 \"No unauthorized person in the park shall do any of the following: (6)  Loitering and \nboisterousness. Sleep or protractedly lounge on the seats, benches, or other areas, or engage in loud, \nboisterous, threatening, abusive, insulting or indecent language, or engage in any disorderly conduct \nor behavior tending to a breach of the public peace.\" \n37. Sec. 58-156, entitled \"Park Operating Policy,\" is a content-based restriction on symbolic speech \nand expressive activity, as follows: \nPage 11 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 12 of 21 PageID 12\n\"(a) Hours . .. Normal park hours are 6:00 a.m. to  10:30 p.m. unless posted otherwise by the \nrecreation manager. Such hours shall be deemed extended by the recreation manager as necessary to \naccommodate athletic sport events, or cultural or civic activities.\" \n38.  Sec. 58-157, entitled \"Violations; Penalties\" states, as follows: \n\"A violation of this division will subject the violator to a find of not less than $25.00 and not more \nthan $250.00. Such violators may be issued appropriate citations by city policy officers.\" \nProvision oft I,e Parades and Processions Ordinance, Sec. 86. \n39. Sec. 86, entitled \"Parades and Processions,\" is a content-based law that has three subsections that \noutline a permitting scheme without specific factors or guidelines and vests unbridled discretion in \nthe Chief of Police, as follows: \n86-153 \"(a) No parade or procession upon any street of the city, and no open-air public meeting upon \nany public property shall be permitted unless a special permit shall first be obtained. Any person \ndesiring a permit under this section shall make written application to the chief of police or some duly \nauthorized member of the police department. Permits issued under this section shall be printed or \nwritten, duly signed by the chief of police or some duly authorized member of the police department \nafter approval, and shall specify the day, hour, place and purpose of such parade, procession or \nopen-air public meeting. (b) The fee for such permit shall be $5.00 if the activity permitted requires \nno extra policing or will cause no extra cost or expense to the city. If such activity will require \nadditional policing or supervision, or otherwise incur additional cost and expense to the city, there \nshall be charged such fee as will defray such additional cost to be determined by the chief of police. \n86-154 \"If the chief of police knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that to permit any parade, \nprocession or open-air meeting under this article mayor will result in violence, fighting, disturbance \nof the peace, or injuries to persons or damage to property, he may refuse to approve issuance of a \npermit hereunder by endorsing on the application or indicating in writing to the city clerk his reason \nfor his refusal and such permit shall not be issued.\" \nPage 12 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 13 of 21 PageID 13\nApplication of City Code to OFM Events \n40.  The City of Fort Myers required OFM to obtain a \"special events\" permit for their expressive \nconduct of \"occupying\" Fort Myers, even though OFM's demonstration does not fall within the \ndefinitional parameters of a \"special event,\" especially since there was never any expectation that \nmore than 1,000 would join the overnight encampment. Because the City arbitrarily subjected OFM \nto the special events requirements, OFM was subjected to restrictive permit requirements not suitable \nfor small, spontaneous First Amendment-protected activity. Furthermore, since OFM was subjected \nto special events provisions, which are reviewed by the Special Events Advisory Board, City Code \nSec. 2-273 allows the Board complete control, without defined appellate procedures, as to whether \nor not to entertain the waiver of any provisions. \n41. The City of Fort Myers has issued citations to members ofOFM for violations of City Code 58-\n153. However, the Code prohibits the erection of tents for the \"purpose of overnight camping.\" The \napplication provision constitutes viewpoint discrimination, and clearly, OFM is not erecting tents for \nthe \"purpose of overnight camping.\" The presence of both OFM-affiliated persons and the tents is in \nfurtherance oft heir fundamental message ofd issatisfaction with the political status quo in this nation. \nOFM is subject to the provisions of Sec. 58-154. This code is impermissibly vague since OFM would \nnot be aware of what constitutes \"boisterousness\" or \"protracted lounging.\" Sec. 58-154 also divests \nmembers of OFM of a liberty interest by penalizing lounging in the park. The City of Fort Myers has \nissued citations to members ofOFM for violations ofC  ity Code 58-156. This section oft he City Code \nis clearly content-based viewpoint discrimination as it shows a policy of preference for non-political \nspeech. The Recreation Manager also has unbridled discretion to extend park hours for sporting, \ncultural or civic events, but not for First Amendment-protected activity. \n42. The FMPD allowed OFM to rally and march, pursuant to City Code 86-153, provided OFM agree \nto certain ad hoc restrictions. These restrictions reflect city policies vesting unbridled discretion in \nthe Fort Myers Police Department and has  an impermissible or, more accurately, an ethereal \nPage 13 of 21 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 14 of 21 PageID 14\npennitting scheme. Because any \"open air meeting\" is subject to the provisions of this code, OFM \nmembers are divested of an important liberty interest. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n43.  As to each cause of action delineated below in Counts One, Two, Three, and Four, the \nplaintiffs advance their federal constitutional claims against the City of Fort Myers in the City's \ncapacity as a state actor, through the operation ofthe Fourteenth Amendment. \nCOUNT ONE \nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983 - Violation of First Amendment - Viewpoint Discrimination) \nFort Myers City Code, Sec. 2-273 and Sec. 58-156 \nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against CITY OF FORT MYERS \n44.

I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. \n2.  I am a resident of Fort Myers, Lee County, Florida. \n3.  Occupy Fort Myers (\"OFM\") is a group of mostly local citizens who have come \ntogether to discuss common grievances, and hold general assemblies.  OFM is an unincorporated \nassociation of individuals concerned about the direction of our country who have spontaneously \ngathered together in an attempt to bring visibility to the insidious influence of money into the \npeople's political process.  OFM seeks to bring awareness to the citizens' concerns \nthrough an around-the-clock, peaceful protest. A core part of OFM's message is in our 24-hour \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 3 of 8 PageID 24\n\"occupation,\" which is a symbolic expression of our frustration with the current U.S. political and \neconomic climate. OFM seeks to cooperate with local police departments and city officials. OFM \nis neither a corporation nor a  not-for-profit organization. OFM is not formally affiliated with any \nnational organization or corporation. OFM does not endorse any political candidate or group. OFM \nhas no funds, no bank account, and does not participate in fundraising. I participate in the ongoing \nOFM demonstration activities and I assist in the organization of the group's activities. \n4.  I had heard about the Occupy Wall Street movement in Zuccotti Park in New York City \nbeginning in September, 2011, and when I saw that a group of individuals were seeking to come \ntogether in Fort Myers in an effort to bring local visibility to Occupy Wall Street, I was excited to \nparticipate. \n5.  Occupy Fort Myers had their first General Assembly on October 8,2011.  I attended \nthe General Assembly and, afterwards, was happy to participate and assist in organizational \nactivities. At the first General Assembly, OFM came to a consensus that we would hold our first rally \nand march on October 15, 2011.  The OFM General Assembly agreed to begin \"occupying\" \nCentennial Park on First Street in Fort Myers in a show of solidarity with Occupy Wall Street and \nto bring local visibility to the citizens' concerns. \n6.  Individual participants agreed to take on certain responsibilities on behalf of OFM \nin an effort to ensure our right and ability to peacefully demonstrate on October 15.  A loosely \norganized OFM \"Legal Working Team,\" of which I am a participant, agreed to work with the City \nofF  ort Myers and/or the Fort Myers Police Department for approval for our planned demonstrations. \nMark Hetrick, who was serving as part ofthe Legal Working Team informed the General Assembly \non or about October 11,2011 that the Fort Myers Police Department (\"FMPD\") said OFM could \nrally and march downtown on Oct. 15th, provided that we submit to certain restrictions, such as \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 4 of 8 PageID 25\nagreeing not to use a megaphone or walk in the street. An FMPD contact said that the police would \nnot interfere with any overnight \"occupation,\" including allowing the erection of tents, as long as \nthere was no alcohol brought into the park. The FMPD advised OFM to contact the City of Fort \nMyers Recreation Division to obtain a permit for the overnight occupation. \n7.  On October 11,2011, the Legal Working Team began speaking with employees of \nthe Recreation Division in an attempt to obtain a permit for OFM's First Amendment-protected \nactivity. \n8.  On October 15,2011, OFM held a noon rally at Centennial Park, and then conducted \nan approximately one mile long march from Centennial Park to the Bank of America branch on First \nStreet, and then back to Centennial Park. Approximately 500 people showed up to support the \nOccupy Fort Myers movement. The march and rally remained peaceful and respectful. There were \nprivate birthday parties occurring under the pavilion in Centennial Park after our return from our \nmarch. OFM agreed to congregate away from the pavilion so that we would not disturb the private \nevent. \n9.  OFM began \"occupying\" Centennial Park on the evening of October 15th The General \n• \nAssembly agreed that the occupiers would respect the City and park by making sure that they \nmaintained quiet after park closing hours and by thoroughly cleaning up after themselves. The \noccupiers had no confrontations with members of the public, the City or FMPD from Oct. 15th \nthrough Oct. 20th. \n10.  On October 14,2011, the Legal Working Team received an email from Peggy Kay, \nRecreation Administrative Manager. Ms. Kay attached Chapter 58, Art. IV, Div. 2, Sections 58-151 \nto 58-157 in response to our inquiry about using Centennial Park for our peaceful demonstration. \nWe were then directed to a 34-page Special Events Handbook. The Handbook had, within it, a \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 5 of 8 PageID 26\nspecial events permit application and required a deposit of $50.  OFM completed the permit \napplication on October 18,2011, and submitted it to the Recreation Division.  OFM informed the \nRecreation Division, along with Officer Sanchez of the FMPD, through email communication that \nOccupy Fort Myers sought to cooperate with the City. On October 19,2011, at 10: 19 a.m., we heard \nfrom Kelly MacDonald, Sr. Program Coordinator in the Recreation Division through email, who \ninformed us that, before the Special Event Committee could even review our permit application, \nOFM would need to obtain a $1 million liability insurance policy and bring the Liability Insurance \ncertificate to the Recreation Administrative Office. Ms. MacDonald informed OFM that the City was \nprepared to enforce Ordinance Sec. 58-153(3), which states that \"[n]o unauthorized person in a park \nshall ... set up tents, shacks, or any other temporary shelter for the purpose of overnight camping,\" \nifOFM did not comply with the liability insurance by 3:00 p.m. on the same day. We immediately \ncontacted Ms. MacDonald that same day by email and phone to let her know that OFM could not \npossibly comply with the 3:00 p.m. deadline to obtain an insurance policy. We also informed Ms. \nMacDonald that OFM had no idea how to obtain or who to contact to obtain such a policy. The City \ngave us the names of three insurance companies-Lot and Gailor, K&K Insurance, and CSI. Ms. \nMacDonald agreed to allow OFM an additional day to attempt to obtain insurance and comply with \nCity regulations. \n11.  On Oct. 19, 2011, OFM informed the City of Fort Myers Recreation Division and \nPolice Department, through email, that the insurance companies designated by the City ofF ort Myers \nwould not provide the requested liability insurance policy to OFM. Lot and Gailor Insurance Agency \nsaid they would not insure OFM because we were not a legal entity. K&K Insurance said that their \nunderwriter would not insure \"these types of events.\" CSI never even returned our call. OFM \ninformed Ms. MacDonald, Mr. Saeed Kazemi, the Public Works Director, and Officer Sanchez of \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 6 of 8 PageID 27\nthe FMPD, through email, that OFM sought understanding and cooperation with the City, that we \nwould like to obtain a pennit, but we could not satisfy the City's requirements. OFM asked that the \nCity not attempt to dismantle OFM. \n12.  OFM reviewed both the City of Fort Myers ordinances and the Special Events \npamphlet, and saw no provision for seeking a waiver of the liability insurance requirement or a \nmeans to seek an appeal of the Recreation Division's refusal to accommodate OFM's request for a \npennit. \n13.  It is my understanding that the City's Ordinance Sec. 2-273(1)(d) allows the Special \nEvents Advisory Board, the entity to which OFM submitted our pennit application, to request that \nthe City Council approve a waiver or reduction of fees for special events. Among the problems with \nthe ordinance code is it does not outline specific procedures for obtaining a pennit for First \nAmendment activity, does not outline any specific procedures to seek a waiver or appeal of permit \ndenial, and contains no exception for spontaneous speech. Additionally, the code gives the Special \nEvents Advisory Board too much discretion in what factors the Board can consider in granting or \ndenying a permit; the ordinances are unduly vague, so that someone would not know what is allowed \nand what is prohibited (how would we know what constitutes \"loud and boisterous\" behavior, for \ninstance?); and the ordinances allow for exceptions and accommodations to be made for \"athletic \nsporting events, or cultural or civic activities,\" but not for political speech, thus showing a clear \npreference for non-political viewpoints. \n14.  On October 19,2011, the Legal Working Team informed OFM during General \nAssembly that OFM's pennit application would be denied, and the City of Fort Myer's Ordinance \nSec. 58-153 would be enforced against OFM. After receiving this news, the General Assembly \nagreed to seek legal advice from an attorney. Even if an insurer would agree to insure OFM, OFM \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 7 of 8 PageID 28\nhas absolutely no funds with which to pay for a liability insurance policy and, it is my understanding, \nthat the City of Fort Myers would require OFM to apply for another permit and obtain are-issuance \nor new insurance policy every ten days. It my further understanding that the City of Fort Myers does \nnot allow an indigency exemption from the monetary permitting regulations. The City's requirement \nthat OFM obtain a liability insurance policy has the effect of being a complete prohibition on OFM's \ncore symbolic speech. \n15.  On October 20,2011, members ofOFM and their legal counsel spent most of the \nday attempting to negotiate, in good faith, with City employees in an attempt to obtain a legal permit \nfor our symbolic demonstration. Despite everyone's best efforts, the City would not issue OFM a \npermit. On the evening of October 20, at approximately 10:45 p.m., members of the FMPD showed \nup at Centennial Park and issued citations ofo ver $1 00 each to any individual who had erected a tent \nin the park or who was planning on remaining in the park after 10:30 p.m. Since the issuance of \ncitations on Oct. 20th I have had to field numerous telephone calls and emails from demonstrators \n, \nand members of the public who are concerned about the threat of harassment and intimidation due \nto the enforcement of these ordinances. OFM held a second downtown march and rally on October \n22. Since the City began issuing citations, approximately 100 people attended the OFM events. \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-1   Filed 10/25/11   Page 8 of 8 PageID 29\n16.  The City of Fort Myers' unconstitutional ordinance scheme has hindered the free \nspeech of OFM and all of the individuals who associate with the group, or who may have wanted \nto associate with the group, but are now fearful to demonstrate in solidarity with OFM due to threats \nof monetary sanctions or, even, arrest, ift hey were to participate. OFM's message has been curtailed, \nand we have suffered constitutional violations as well as monetary damages due to the cost of \ncitations, costs of materials for signs that had to be removed, and because of loss of supplies while \nrushing to disassemble the encampment area. Also, OFM suffered, and continues to suffer, the loss \nof valuable media attention that arose from our overnight symbolic expression. \nPursuant to 28 U .S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted on this ~ day of October, 20 II. \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-2   Filed 10/25/11   Page 1 of 4 PageID 30\nExhibit 2 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-2   Filed 10/25/11   Page 2 of 4 PageID 31\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nFORT MYERS DIVISION \nCASE NO: \nOCCUPY FORT MYERS, CINDY \nBANYAI, STEPHANIE DARST, \nCHRISTOPHER FAULKNER, F.

I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. \n2.  I am a resident of Lehigh Acres, Lee County, Florida. \n3.  On October  15,  2011,  I began  organizing and participating in  demonstrations at \nCentennial Park, 200 West First Street, Fort Myers, Florida. My participation includes attending \nmarches, gatherings, rallies, general assemblies, and other Occupy events. I have spent numerous \nhours the past week in Centennial Park sitting at the Occupy Fort Myers \"Information Booth,\" and \nspeaking to members of the public about our message. \n4. I am participating in the Occupy events because I believe that monetary influence has led \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-2   Filed 10/25/11   Page 3 of 4 PageID 32\nto corruption in the U.S. policies and elections. I strongly believe in and support the Occupy \nideology. \n5. To stand in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, I planned to and have been symbolically \n\"occupy\" Fort Myers by camping overnight in Centennial Park on Thursday, October 20,2011. The \nOccupy Fort Myers \"encampment\" is an area of approximately 10-12 tents erected in the southwest \nquadrant of Centennial Park. At the \"entrance way\" of the encampment area, there is an information \nbooth where members of the general public can stop by to engage in a discussion of our ideas or to \nask questions about our views on social justice and economic equality. Behind the information \nbooth, but in front of the tent area are handmade signs temporarily erected to communicate our core \nbeliefs to members of the general pUblic. \n6.  Around 11 :00 p.m. on the evening of Oct. 20, 2011, I was given two citations by a Fort \nMyers Police Department law enforcement officer, both in the amount of $135.00 for remaining in \nthe park after closing hours and for unlawful construction of a tent on City property.  I was advised \nby the FMPD that I would be issued a citation every night if! intended to symbolically \"occupy\" the \npark. Since the original 2 citations were issued, I've received 6 more for a total of 8 citations. \n7.  It is my understanding that the Fort Myers Police are enforcing the City of Fort Myers \nordinances because we were unable to obtain a permit for our symbolic speech. It is my further \nunderstanding that the Recreation Division has authority to recommend the issuance of permits and \nto waive certain provisions, but they would not waive those provisions for Occupy Fort Myers. \n8.  I wish to continue to respectfully and peacefully \"occupy\" a public area of Fort Myers, \nbut I fear I will suffer further monetary damages and I also fear that, in the future, I could suffer \narrest due to the City policies and codes. The monetary loss and threat of arrest intimidates me as \nI am a single father with a young child.  I fear that continued government intrusion will continue to \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-2   Filed 10/25/11   Page 4 of 4 PageID 33\ninhibit the exercise of my First Amendment rights. \nPursuantto 28 U.S.C. §1746, I declare under penalty ofp erjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted on this1.3 day of October, 2011. \nIL&~ \nChristopher Faulkner \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-3   Filed 10/25/11   Page 1 of 4 PageID 34\nExhibit 3 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-3   Filed 10/25/11   Page 2 of 4 PageID 35\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nFORT MYERS DIVISION \nCASE NO: \nOCCUPY FORT MYERS, CINDY \nBANY AI, STEPHANIE DARST, \nCHRISTOPHER FAULKNER, F.

I have actively participated with Occupy Fort Myers since its inception. My participation \nincludes attending rallies, organizational meeting, general assemblies, marches and other Occupy \nevents. I have engaged in dialogue regarding the nature and reform ofo ur system ofg overnment with \nother members of Occupy Fort Myers, as well as with member oft he general public on public streets, \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-3   Filed 10/25/11   Page 3 of 4 PageID 36\nin public parks and in other public spaces in the City of Fort Myers. I also serve as a citizen \njournalist. \n4.  I have been participating in Occupy events because I strongly believe in supporting the \nrights of average people in participating in the policy, economic and social debate of this Country. \n5.  In an attempt to bring visibility to my concerns about the right of the average person to \nbe heard in the political process, I planned to symbolically \"occupy\" Fort Myers by camping \novernight in Centennial Park on Friday, October 21, 2011. \n6.  Around 6:15 p.m. on the morning of October 21,2011, I was advised by Capt. Viola of \nthe Fort Myers Police Department that the public park was rented until noon by Humana Insurance \nCo., a private corporation, for an Alzheimer's Awareness event. Capt. Viola further informed me that \nHumana representatives approached FMPD and requested that the \"occupiers\" and our tents be \nremoved from the park, but we could return at noon. I was given a citation by a Fort Myers Police \nDepartment law enforcement officer in the amount of$135.00 for remaining in the park after closing \nhours even though, at the same time ofd ay I was in the park expressing my political views, Humana \nrepresentatives were in the park, also, setting up for their Alzheimer's event. \n7.  It is my understanding that the Fort Meyers Police Department would not issue citations \nif the City of Fort Myers Recreation Division would accommodate our event by allowing for us to \nparticipate in our expressive conduct after park closing hours. It is my further understanding that the \nCity ofF  ort Myers ordinances require the Recreation Manager to accommodate athletic, cultural and \ncivic events that occur after hours, but the City has refused to accommodate OFM. \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-3   Filed 10/25/11   Page 4 of 4 PageID 37\n8.

I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. \n2.  I am a resident of Lehigh Acres, Lee County, Florida. \n3.  On October 15, 2011,  I began organizing and  participating  in  demonstrations  at \nCentennial Park, 200 West First Street, Fort Myers, Florida. My participation includes attending \nrallies, marches, general assemblies and other Occupy events. I have made and held signs displaying \nour message to members of the general pUblic. \n4.  I choose to participate in the Occupy events because I am tired of the suppression of the \nmasses, and the loss of personal fulfillment which has occurred because of the desire of those who \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-4   Filed 10/25/11   Page 3 of 3 PageID 40\nhave money to attain more material wealth, and the need of those who do not have money to sustain \ntheir day-to-day lives. \n5.  To bring local visibility to my concerns. I planned to symbolically \"occupy\" Fort Myers \nby camping overnight in Centennial Park on Thursday, October 20,2011. \n6. Around 11 :00 p.m. on the evening of Oct. 20, 2011, I was given a citation by a Fort Myers \nPolice Department law enforcement officer in the amount of$135.00 for remaining in the park after \nclosing hours.  I was advised by the Fort Myers Police Department that I would be issued a citation \nevery night ifI intended to symbolically \"occupy\" the park. \n7.  It is my understanding that the City of Fort Myers may accommodate sporting or cultural \nevents after park closing hours, but our symbolic speech is not being accommodated by the City. \n8. I desire to continue my peaceful \"occupation\" ofa public area of Fort Myers, but because \nI am underemployed. the cost of the citation is an economic hardship for me.  I am also concerned \nthat more citations, or even arrests, may soon follow. I fear further intimidation or harassment from \nCity employees will continue to inhibit the exercise of my First Amendment rights. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted on this ?3 day of October, 2011. \nLuis Ospina \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-5   Filed 10/25/11   Page 1 of 3 PageID 41\nExhibit 5 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-5   Filed 10/25/11   Page 2 of 3 PageID 42\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-5   Filed 10/25/11   Page 3 of 3 PageID 43\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-6   Filed 10/25/11   Page 1 of 7 PageID 44\nExhibit 6 \n\nMunicode  http://library.municode.com/print.aspx?c1ientlD= I 3900&HTMRequ ... \nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 1-6   Filed 10/25/11   Page 2 of 7 PageID 45\nFort Myers, Florida, Code of Ordinances »  Subpart A -ADMINISTRATIVE CODE »  Chapter 2 -\nADMINISTRATION »  ARTICLE III. -BOARDS, COMMITTEES, COMMISSIONS »  DIVISION 9. -\nSPECIAL EVENTS ADVISORY BOARD» \nDIVISION 9. - SPECIAL EVENTS ADVISORY BOARD \nSec. 2-271. - Purpose; creation; membership; terms; vacancies; qualifications; nonvoting meeting attendees. \nSec. 2-272. -Oath: officers: records: meetings: quorum: attendance: minutes: compensation. \nSec. 2-273. -Powers and duties. \nSees. 2-274-2-290. -Reserved. \nSec. 2-271. -Purpose; creation; membership; terms; vacancies; qualifications; \nnonvoting meeting attendees. \n(a)  Pursuant to Charter section 83, there is hereby created a board of seven members and two alternate \nmembers to serve in the absence of a member to be known as the Special Events Advisory Board.

Permits issued under this section shall be\nprinted or written, duly signed by the chief of police\nor some duly authorized member of the police department\nafter approval, and shall specify the day, hour, place\nand  purpose  of  such  parade,  procession  or  open-air\npublic meeting.\nFort Myers, Fla. Ordinance § 86-153(a).  \n2.  Plaintiffs have established that they are substantially likely\nto succeed on the merits as to the claims that the highlighted portion\nof Ordinance 58-156(a) is unconstitutional on its face as a violation\nof the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Ordinance\n58-156(a) states: \nExcept for unusual and unforeseen emergencies, parks shall be\nopen to the public every day of the year during designated\nhours. The opening and closing hours shall be posted for\npublic information.  Normal park hours are 6:00 a.m. to 10:30\np.m. unless posted otherwise by the recreation manager.

Plaintiffs have established that their injury resulting from\nenforcement of these Ordinances outweighs the potential injury to the\nCity of Fort Myers if the preliminary injunction is granted; and\n6.    Plaintiffs  have  established  that  an  injunction  barring\nenforcement of these Ordinances would not harm or do a disservice to\nthe public interest.  \nAccordingly, it is now\nORDERED:\n1.

It is Case 2:11\n 7 Civil 608.\n 8 Counsel, if you'd identify yourselves and your\n 9 respective clients, please, beginning with counsel for the\n10 Plaintiff?\n11 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  May it please the\n12 Court.  Jennifer Keesler, from Cape Coral, on behalf of the\n13 Plaintiffs.\n14 MS. SHLACKMAN:  May it please the Court, Mara\n15 Shlackman from Fort Lauderdale, on behalf of the Plaintiffs.\n16 THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.\n17 MR. ALLEY:  Grant Alley, City Attorney, Fort\n18 Myers.\n19 MR. MORIARTY:  Mark Moriarty, Assistant City\n20 Attorney, Fort Myers.\n21 THE COURT:  We are here for Plaintiffs' motion for\n22 a preliminary injunction.  I've received what the city has\n23 called a partial response.  Looks like it was filed\n24 yesterday.  I saw it this morning.\n25 Both sides ready?\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 5 of 68 PageID 433\n     5\n 1 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.\n 2 MR. ALLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.\n 3 THE COURT:  All right.  I saw, this morning, in\n 4 the newspaper, that the issue of the insurance had been\n 5 resolved, although a permit had not yet issued.  Is there\n 6 any change in that?  And if a permit has issued, does that\n 7 moot the injunction portion of this?  I guess let me look to\n 8 counsel for the Plaintiff, first.\n 9 MS. KEESLER:  Your Honor, to the best of my\n10 knowledge, a permit has not yet issued.  I am aware that\n11 members of the Plaintiffs' group went to the City Recreation\n12 Department on Friday afternoon, and they attempted to obtain\n13 a permit.  And they had indicated to me they were told that,\n14 today, the Special Events Advisory Board would consider it.\n15 I have not heard that they've received one yet.\n16 In the event that a permit is received, I do not\n17 believe it would moot this issue.  It is my understanding\n18 that permits are only issued for ten days.  Therefore, this\n19 would fall under the bourgeois standard of capable of\n20 repetition yet evading review, because we --\n21 THE COURT:  I'm not suggesting the case would be\n22 mooted.  What I'm suggesting is the need for an injunction\n23 would be mooted.  And I suppose the answer, in part, depends\n24 on whether the permit expires in ten days, and all that does\n25 is postpone the issue for ten days.  I'm not suggesting the\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 6 of 68 PageID 434\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER      6\n 1 case would be mooted even with a permit.\n 2 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.\n 3 THE COURT:  What's your thought as to that?  I\n 4 mean, if a permit gets issued, and it's -- let's assume it's\n 5 forever -- does that moot the need for an injunction, or is\n 6 there something else to be enjoined?\n 7 MS. KEESLER:  I would . . . I would submit that\n 8 there would be other ordinances that would need to be\n 9 enjoined; specifically, the loitering ordinance, which I\n10 believe could be used, even if there is a permit, to attempt\n11 to dissuade speech.  And again, there is the issue of, in\n12 ten days, we may be right back in here even if we do get a\n13 ten-day permit.\n14 THE COURT:  And what part of your complaint talks\n15 about the loitering?  Or have you called it something else?\n16 MS. KEESLER:  It was Count 3 and 4 of the verified\n17 complaint.  It was the 14th Amendment liberty interest and\n18 the 14th Amendment vagueness challenge.\n19 THE COURT:  Three and four.  The liberty interest\n20 is sit wherever you want to sit.  Whenever you want to sit.\n21 All right.  Mr. Alley, what, if anything, do you\n22 know with regard to permits and if one is issued, whether\n23 that moots the injunction part of this or not?\n24 MR. ALLEY:  May it please the Court, did you say\n25 we could sit?\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 7 of 68 PageID 435\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY      7\n 1 THE COURT:  I didn't, but if you'd like to, you\n 2 may.\n 3 MR. ALLEY:  I apologize.  Your Honor, as of, my\n 4 understanding is, late Friday, after work hours, that there\n 5 was an insurance that was provided, and the city's in the\n 6 process of reviewing that insurance; and the city's position\n 7 is that, if a permit is issued, that that would -- it would\n 8 moot the need for an injunction.\n 9 The Plaintiffs have indicated that -- at least to\n10 the media, that they're going to be vacating the park during\n11 another event in the park, and then they would go to another\n12 park.  And so the city's position is that it would render\n13 the need for an injunction moot under the mootness doctrine.\n14 With respect to the loitering ordinance, it's the\n15 city's position that the Plaintiff has not asked this Court\n16 to enjoin the loitering ordinance, that the Plaintiff has\n17 filed a temporary restraining order ex parté, what the city\n18 has referred to as a sneak attack, while the city was\n19 negotiating with the Plaintiffs, and they have not asked to\n20 enjoin that section of the code in their pleading for the\n21 temporary restraining order.  The Court denied the temporary\n22 restraining order on procedural grounds.\n23 And on the emergency motion for a preliminary\n24 injunction, the Plaintiff has not sought to enjoin, in an\n25 emergency fashion, or even ask this Court to enjoin the --\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 8 of 68 PageID 436\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY      8\n 1 what they call loitering ordinance.  The loitering ordinance\n 2 that they refer to in their verified complaint is contained\n 3 in Section 58-154.  And they've asked, in their verified --\n 4 they've asked, in their emergency injunction and in their\n 5 temporary restraining order, to enjoin four sections of the\n 6 city code, that being 58-153, 58-156, 2-273, and 86-153.\n 7 THE COURT:  If the city does issue the permit, is\n 8 it valid for ten days, or some other length of time, or\n 9 what's the situation there?\n10 MR. ALLEY:  I don't know the answer to that.\n11 THE COURT:  The Plaintiffs' complaint pleads that\n12 they were told, I don't remember by whom, that they would\n13 need to go through the process of getting a permit and\n14 insurance, essentially, every ten days.  Do you know if\n15 that's accurate?\n16 MR. ALLEY:  I have no reason to disbelieve the\n17 Plaintiffs' counsel's representation.  The Special Events\n18 Permits, that's controlled under 2-273, and they are seeking\n19 to enjoin that in an emergency fashion.  And that -- that --\n20 what they're seeking to enjoin is the Special Events\n21 Advisory Board.  And they're not seeking to enjoin the\n22 creation of it or the processes that they follow, they're\n23 seeking to enjoin all of the powers and duties of the\n24 Special Events Advisory Board.\n25 The Special Events Advisory Board is going to, as\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 9 of 68 PageID 437\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY      9\n 1 Plaintiffs' represent, is going to be meeting to decide --\n 2 to make a decision on some aspect of the Plaintiffs' permit\n 3 request, as the Plaintiffs' attorney represents.  I'm not\n 4 aware of that.  But what I'm aware of is that special events\n 5 get granted for protests, special events get granted for\n 6 sporting events, but if there's somebody else that is using\n 7 the park exclusively because they have a prior special event\n 8 that's been issued, or if there's someone else that's using\n 9 that portion of the park, then the -- then the permit will\n10 be denied.  If the park's open, then the permit will be\n11 granted.  And there's a Taste of the Town event coming up in\n12 the City of Fort Myers, and I know, during that period of\n13 time, that the park has been already . . . already permitted\n14 for the Taste of the Town event.\n15 THE COURT:  All right.\n16 Ms. Keesler, you may proceed.\n17 MS. KEESLER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Your Honor,\n18 do you prefer that we speak from the counsel table or from\n19 the lecturn?\n20 THE COURT:  I prefer the lecturn, but it's up to\n21 your preference.\n22 MS. KEESLER:  Thank you.  Good afternoon, Your\n23 Honor.\n24 The Plaintiffs requested today's hearing to ask\n25 the Court to enjoin Defendant City of Fort Myers from\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 10 of 68 PageID 438\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     10\n 1 enforcing several provisions of their city code.  These code\n 2 sections have chilled and precluded core political speech,\n 3 conduct and assembly that's protected by the First\n 4 Amendment; and unless it's enjoined, it will continue to\n 5 infringe upon such protected rights of the Plaintiffs and\n 6 others similarly situated.  Accordingly, my clients have\n 7 launched a special challenge to the certain sections of the\n 8 City of Fort Myers code.  I would like to deal with the\n 9 easiest section first.\n10 Section 86-153 is the Parades and Processions\n11 Ordinance.  It's a prior restraint as a permit from the\n12 Chief of Police is required parades, processions, and\n13 open-air meetings.\n14 THE COURT:  Is this the one that the city says\n15 they don't --\n16 MS. KEESLER:  Yes.\n17 THE COURT:  -- there's a resolution that says they\n18 don't enforce it?\n19 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Based on the\n20 documents filed yesterday, the city, in 2004, during a\n21 different ordinance challenge, voluntarily agreed to stop\n22 enforcing the parade ordinance.  However, it does still\n23 remain officially on the books, and it appears to have been\n24 renumbered in the most recent 2006 enactment of the Code.\n25 Therefore, groups and individuals who seek to have a parade,\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 11 of 68 PageID 439\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     11\n 1 or procession, or an open-air rally, look to the Code.\n 2 THE COURT:  I'm sorry, let me stop you.  This may\n 3 be the easiest.\n 4 Let me just hear from the city.  I mean, you've\n 5 got an ordinance on the books that, in 2004, you promised\n 6 not to enforce?  What's that all about?  Why shouldn't I\n 7 enjoin from you enforcing that?\n 8 MR. ALLEY:  We believe it's moot.  It is not being\n 9 enforced.  We've submitted Docket Number 28, which is the\n10 correspondence from the City Attorney and the protestors\n11 Mr. Green and Mr. Thomas, dated October, 2011; and, in that\n12 correspondence, it says a permit is not required.\n13 We submitted documentation of a legal memorandum\n14 of October 17, 2011, the City Attorney to the City Manager,\n15 saying a permit is to -- in affect, a permit is not required\n16 under the First Amendment, that they would just have to\n17 comply with state laws and other sections of the city code,\n18 regarding obstruction of traffic, that the Plaintiffs have\n19 not challenged.\n20 We've submitted additional correspondence, dated\n21 April 7, 2006, to the Immigration Latin United of Florida\n22 and the City of Fort Myers, which was a protest that was\n23 supposed to have a hundred thousand people in the City of\n24 Fort Myers.  That's what was being organized.  It didn't\n25 turn out that way, but it was a rather large protest.  And\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 12 of 68 PageID 440\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     12\n 1 that correspondence to those parties to the organizers of\n 2 that protest basically provided, in a two-page letter, that\n 3 they needed to contact the city to identify what areas and\n 4 what -- where they were marching, what streets would need to\n 5 be closed, and are they providing for portable toilets,\n 6 water, food, because the city has limited resources.  It\n 7 told them they didn't need to get a permit, but we were\n 8 going to hold them responsible to any damages to persons or\n 9 properties that their event caused, as organizers of the\n10 event.\n11 We submitted in that -- in support of that, also,\n12 a -- the Code Article Parades and Processions, and excerpts\n13 from the December 13, 2004, City Council meeting where the\n14 City Council passed a resolution abating enforcement of not\n15 only the section the Plaintiffs are complaining about, which\n16 is 86-153, but also we abate 86-152 and 86-154.  It somehow\n17 got codified in the books after it was abated.  It used to\n18 be under Section 17, and then it somehow got codified in\n19 Section 86.\n20 The city does not enforce it.  We believe it is\n21 moot as applied to these Plaintiffs.  The Plaintiffs were\n22 never asked to get a permit under this section, the\n23 Plaintiffs were never given a citation under this section,\n24 and the Plaintiffs have been able to freely protest on the\n25 city streets and sidewalks.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 13 of 68 PageID 441\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     13\n 1 In the Plaintiffs' verification, they indicate\n 2 that they contacted the police department, and the response\n 3 from the police department was stay off the city streets,\n 4 don't go on to the city streets, don't block the city\n 5 streets, and don't use . . . I can't think of the terms, but\n 6 not blow horns to magnify your voice.  In fact, they did.\n 7 They were on city streets, and, in fact, they did use those\n 8 blow -- megaphones.\n 9 And, finally, the -- the permit requirement has\n10 never been applied to this Plaintiff, has never been applied\n11 to anyone with respect to the Plaintiff, and the Court can\n12 take -- we believe that that matter is rendered moot because\n13 it has no applicability here, and because the city is not\n14 enforcing that by the actions of City Council.\n15 THE COURT:  When you say the city, by resolution\n16 in 2004, abated enforcement, why was it abated?\n17 MR. ALLEY:  It was abated because the city and\n18 the -- the city entered into an agreement, a settlement\n19 agreement, that the city was not going to enforce section --\n20 any section of its parade ordinance, that entire article.\n21 Not just Section 86-153, but also the purpose clause and the\n22 penalties clause; 86-152 and 86-154.\n23 The city entered into a settlement agreement that\n24 the city was not going to enforce that section of the Code,\n25 and that the city would be repealing that section of the\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 14 of 68 PageID 442\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     14\n 1 Code.  And the city entered into a settlement agreement that\n 2 said that the city would be repealing a provision of the\n 3 Special Events Permit application process that had -- that\n 4 contained language that they -- that protestors could not\n 5 hand out leaflets or pamphlets.  And there were some other\n 6 complained-of materials on that case approximately seven or\n 7 eight years ago.\n 8 THE COURT:  And the city reneged because it didn't\n 9 repeal?\n10 MR. ALLEY:  No.  The city abated enforcement of\n11 the ordinance.  And it was under Section 17, and it somehow\n12 got recodified when the Code got recodified.  It -- the old\n13 Code was repealed, the new Code language was codified under\n14 a new section.  It was -- the language was divided in --\n15 what was originally contained in two paragraphs was switched\n16 to three separate sections.\n17 THE COURT:  So anyone who looks at the city code\n18 today would see that that is still an ordinance that, at\n19 least on its face, would apply to them.\n20 MR. ALLEY:  The Court's correct, and the city is\n21 acting posthaste, as we've advised Plaintiffs' counsel this\n22 morning -- or a lawyer from Plaintiffs' counsel.  I'm not\n23 sure if -- if they're admitted in the Middle District or\n24 not, but we work -- the lawyers are working well together.\n25 At least that's my perception.  We've advised them we're\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 15 of 68 PageID 443\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     15\n 1 taking it off the books posthaste, and we wanted to discuss\n 2 other sections of the litigation.\n 3 THE COURT:  When you say you're taking it off the\n 4 books, what does that mean?\n 5 MR. ALLEY:  Well, we had permission to advertise\n 6 to repeal and repealing.  We believe it has no legal effect\n 7 right now, and we've provided that information.  We believe\n 8 it has no legal effect because the Court has jurisdiction\n 9 and federal law trumps our Code.\n10 THE COURT:  So what you're saying is it has no\n11 binding effect because it's obviously unconstitutional?\n12 MR. ALLEY:  I'm saying it has no binding effect in\n13 the settlement agreement that the city entered into.  The\n14 city did not make an admission of -- it did not address the\n15 constitutionality of the Code provisions.  The city entered\n16 into a settlement agreement saying that it would repeal\n17 those sections of the Code.\n18 THE COURT:  A settlement agreement has nothing to\n19 do with me, I don't think.  Or this case.  I mean, it seems\n20 to me -- and perhaps I'm reading between the lines\n21 unnecessarily, but if it says what counsel says it says, it\n22 virtually has to be unconstitutional, and I would presume\n23 that's why the city agreed to abate enforcement, whatever\n24 that means.  And, for whatever . . . however it happened,\n25 it's still on the books.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 16 of 68 PageID 444\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     16\n 1 How is it that this group of Plaintiffs isn't\n 2 going to win on that?  Other than, I suppose, the argument\n 3 is a standing one, since no one has tried to apply to it\n 4 them.  But it's pretty clear, isn't it, to the extent that\n 5 that provision is still on the books, it can't possibly be\n 6 constitutional?\n 7 MR. ALLEY:  Your Honor, when the city entered into\n 8 the settlement agreement which the Court has reserved\n 9 jurisdiction to enforce, the city did not concede that\n10 the -- that that ordinance -- that those ordinance sections\n11 were unconstitutional.  The city did not concede that.  The\n12 city agreed that they would repeal that provision of the\n13 ordinance, and the city immediately enacted a resolution\n14 abating any enforcement of that -- of those ordinance\n15 sections, and the city has not enforced that ordinance\n16 section against anybody, and -- since the city entered into\n17 that settlement agreement.\n18 When it was under Section 17 . . . it's no longer\n19 under Section 17.  When the Code got recodified, the old\n20 Code got repealed, and now the language shows up in three\n21 paragraphs under Section 86.  It shouldn't be there.  And\n22 we're -- the Plaintiffs' litigation, we identified it's in\n23 the books, and when they filed their litigation, the Court\n24 denied the temporary restraining order; however, the Court\n25 granted an expedited hearing, and we've had three or four\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 17 of 68 PageID 445\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     17\n 1 days to research this, and it -- we're moving posthaste to\n 2 get it off the books.  However, we have established that we\n 3 have not -- we have not utilized this ordinance, and we have\n 4 not applied it to these Plaintiffs.  And there are sections\n 5 of the city code, that aren't being challenged, that say you\n 6 can't block streets and you can't block sidewalks.  It has\n 7 no other prohibitions.  And there are also sections of state\n 8 law that state that.  So we need to get those sections off\n 9 the book.  Admittedly, we didn't concede, in the litigation,\n10 that it was unconstitutional on its face.\n11 THE COURT:  So it's still a live issue, I guess.\n12 MR. ALLEY:  Your Honor, respectfully, the . . . we\n13 have passed -- we've taken official action by the highest\n14 authority the city has, the governing body, and adopted a\n15 resolution that the city is not enforcing -- the city will\n16 not enforce --\n17 THE COURT:  You tell me what the difference is\n18 between agreeing not to enforce it and not taking it off the\n19 books.\n20 MR. ALLEY:  We should have taken it off the books.\n21 THE COURT:  And all they did in 2004 is to abate\n22 enforcement of it, and it's been on the books for the next\n23 seven years.\n24 MR. ALLEY:  It was in Section 17.  It's now in --\n25 THE COURT:  Moving sections doesn't change\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 18 of 68 PageID 446\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     18\n 1 anything.  All you're doing is maybe trying to hide it.  But\n 2 you agreed to repeal it, you didn't repeal it, you abated\n 3 it, and it's still on the books.  Why doesn't that make it a\n 4 live issue?\n 5 MR. ALLEY:  Because it has not been applied to the\n 6 Plaintiffs, and they have not been -- there were 73 -- as of\n 7 the 20 . . . .  On Docket Number 23, as of October 26th,\n 8 there were 73 citations issued, and they were -- none of\n 9 them were issued for this section of the Code as applied to\n10 the -- as applied to the Plaintiffs.  In the Plaintiffs'\n11 verified complaint, they indicate that they contacted the\n12 FMPD, the Fort Myers Police Department, and they were told\n13 don't block the streets, and don't use the megaphone.  And\n14 the city has shown a history in its not enforcement this\n15 section of the Code because it's not applicable.  Both in\n16 court --\n17 THE COURT:  Not enforcing a Code and leaving it on\n18 the books so anyone who is doing legal research who wants to\n19 check can find it, how does that possibly not chill\n20 someone's exercise of First Amendment rights when they look\n21 it up and city ordinance says they can't do any of these\n22 things.\n23 MR. ALLEY:  Your Honor, it clearly is a violation\n24 if there is an unconstitutional order -- if there is an\n25 unconstitutional code if it's in the Code.  That clearly is\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 19 of 68 PageID 447\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     19\n 1 a violation.  And it does have a chilling affect, and\n 2 there's no disagreement.  And that's what the severability\n 3 clause of the Code of Ordinance is for and that's what\n 4 the -- the city, in passing a resolution that says that the\n 5 city is not enforcing this provision of the Code, and when\n 6 it got recodified, it shouldn't have been put in, and it was\n 7 put in.  It was put in in the form of three paragraphs.\n 8 THE COURT:  All right.  If you want to lose\n 9 ground, go ahead and argue that, but I understand that\n10 issue.\n11 MS. KEESLER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I'd like to\n12 move on to the park regulations ordinance.  On Page 3 of the\n13 Plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunctive\n14 Relief, Plaintiff does ask in their wherefore clause, to\n15 have this Court enjoin Sections 58-153 through 58-156.\n16 Plaintiffs' attorney apologizes for not being clearer.\n17 After reviewing Defendant's response, Plaintiffs'\n18 stipulate that they only seek to enjoin the sections of the\n19 park regulations code that are either vague, overbroad, or\n20 content-based viewpoint discrimination; specifically,\n21 Section 58-153, Subsection 3; Section 58-154 Section 6; and\n22 Section 58-156 in its entirety.\n23 The first two, 58-153, Subsection 3; and 58-154\n24 Subsection 6, are impermissibly vague and violate due\n25 process for the reasons that the Plaintiffs outlined in\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 20 of 68 PageID 448\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     20\n 1 their memorandum of law, specifically quoting city -- or\n 2 City of Chicago versus Morales, they failed to establish\n 3 standards for the police and public that are sufficient to\n 4 guard against arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests.\n 5 Section 58-156, Subsection A of the park\n 6 regulations regarding operating hours closes the city parks\n 7 to everyone from 10:30 in the evening until 6:00 a.m. in the\n 8 morning, except for when the recreation manager shall make\n 9 accommodations for a sporting, cultural or civic event.\n10 Exempting preferred speech from city regulations makes an\n11 ordinance content based on its face.\n12 Section 58-156, Subsection B vests unbridled\n13 discretion on the recreation manager to close the park at\n14 his whim during normal operating hours.  While these are\n15 being challenged facially, Plaintiffs have been issued\n16 citations under both subsections.\n17 THE COURT:  Say that last part again.\n18 MS. KEESLER:  Plaintiffs have received citations,\n19 monetary citations, under both of those subsections.\n20 THE COURT:  But, for all of your claims, what\n21 you've alleged is facial claims for all four counts?\n22 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  These are all\n23 facial challenges.\n24 Regarding the Special Events Advisory Board --\n25 THE COURT:  Let me go back a minute to the park\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 21 of 68 PageID 449\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     21\n 1 regulations.  Is it your position that the city cannot close\n 2 a public park?\n 3 MS. KEESLER:  No, that is not my position.  The\n 4 Plaintiffs' position is that exempting certain types of\n 5 events, such as sporting, cultural, or civic events, shows a\n 6 preference for nonpolitical speech.\n 7 THE COURT:  If the ordinance was just 156-A,\n 8 saying the hours of the park are whatever they are, end of\n 9 ordinance, is there anything unconstitutional with that?\n10 MS. KEESLER:  No, Your Honor.\n11 THE COURT:  So it's only the impact of 156(b),\n12 that has this exception, that causes the ordinance, in your\n13 view, to be content based, and therefore a violation of the\n14 1st Amendment?\n15 MS. KEESLER:  Subsection (a), 58-156,\n16 Subsection (a) is the section that indicates that the\n17 recreation manager can keep the park open for specific types\n18 of events.\n19 THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  So it's two sentences, or\n20 whatever, but all of 156(a)?\n21 MS. KEESLER:  Yes.\n22 THE COURT:  All right.\n23 MS. KEESLER:  And --\n24 THE COURT:  So, but for that sentence -- I'm sorry\n25 for stepping on you, but, but for that sentence, the second\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 22 of 68 PageID 450\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     22\n 1 sentence, as I understand your position, there's no claim\n 2 that the city has to have a park open 24/7.\n 3 MS. KEESLER:  No, Your Honor.\n 4 THE COURT:  All right.  And it's only because of\n 5 the sentence that gives somebody the authority to make an\n 6 exception for certain types of events that creates this\n 7 1st Amendment problem, in your view?\n 8 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.\n 9 THE COURT:  Okay.  Go ahead.\n10 MS. KEESLER:  The Special Events Advisory Board,\n11 the city code 2-273.  According to Page 5 of the special\n12 events pamphlet, the Special Events Advisory Board, which is\n13 created in the Code Section 2-271 through 2-273, has final\n14 approval of all events in the city.  Also, according to the\n15 same pamphlet, any events on public property requires a\n16 Special Events Permit.  This requires anybody wanting to\n17 protest within city limits, on public property, to go\n18 through the Special Events Advisory Board.\n19 Pursuant to the challenge section, the Special\n20 Events Advisory Board is to advise the City Council as to\n21 all special events with an eye toward:  One, facilitating\n22 quality cultural and artistic events; and, two, to provide\n23 exposure and positive social and economic impacts for the\n24 city.  This is to be done by either recommending or\n25 withholding recommendation of funding for special events\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 23 of 68 PageID 451\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     23\n 1 open to the public and held within city limits.\n 2 Subsection 3 of the same ordinance gives the same\n 3 advisory board authority to recommend events that should\n 4 either be given reduced fees or even monetary sponsorship by\n 5 the city based upon an undefined weighted scale of merit.\n 6 Subsection 4 of the Code gives the board authority\n 7 to recommend regulations for the conduct of special events\n 8 based only on the criteria of whether it will \"Increase\n 9 interest to the citizens, residents, and visitors,\" of the\n10 city.\n11 In analyzing and striking down a similar special\n12 events committee in Bledsoe versus city of Jacksonville\n13 Beach, the Middle District Court noted that this type of\n14 content filtering, although quaint in a Mayberry RFD\n15 aspirational way, takes on an Orwellian aspect when applied\n16 in the real world.\n17 In order for the Special Events Advisory Board to\n18 determine the fees and regulations of special events, the\n19 board must look at each event with an eye to the interest of\n20 the citizens, and they have to assign each event on a\n21 weighted scale of merit.  Under this Code, the Special\n22 Events Advisory Board, or whomever makes the determination,\n23 cannot help but to examine the content of the message of\n24 each event in order to determine fees, conditions, and even\n25 issuance of a permit.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 24 of 68 PageID 452\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     24\n 1 Both the park regulations and the special events\n 2 code vest unbridled discretion on city officials.  There's\n 3 nothing in the ordinance that prevents city officials from\n 4 applying one standard to one group while applying an\n 5 entirely different standard to a different group.\n 6 Under Bourgeois versus Peters, this is considered\n 7 an unconstitutional content-based restriction.  There are no\n 8 parameters to consider, no internal guidance to granting\n 9 permits.  The government regulation that allows arbitrary\n10 application is inherently inconsistent with a valid time,\n11 place, and manner regulation, quoting Forsyth versus The\n12 Nationalist Movement.\n13 Finally, the City's policy fails to provide a\n14 procedural guideline as outlined in Freedman versus\n15 Maryland, which is needed on a content-based scheme.  And\n16 that is noted in Burk versus Augusta County in their\n17 Footnote 12.\n18 Because these are content-based ordinances, the\n19 city has the burden of advancing a necessary compelling\n20 interest to survive a facial challenge.  The city's interest\n21 in esthetics and public safety are unsufficient to justify\n22 content-based codes.\n23 It is difficult to comprehend how a dozen\n24 individuals in the park will cause more destruction of park\n25 facilities than teams of athletes and hundreds or maybe even\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 25 of 68 PageID 453\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     25\n 1 thousands of spectators at sporting events.  It's difficult\n 2 to understand how a dozen individuals in the park will be a\n 3 greater threat to public safety than potentially intoxicated\n 4 members of the public leaving local bars about at 2:00 a.m.\n 5 Furthermore the enforcement of these content-based\n 6 regulations is not the least restrictive means available to\n 7 the city, as the city already has the ability to enforce\n 8 state penal codes should any individual threaten harm.\n 9 For these reasons, the Plaintiff respectfully\n10 requests that this Court grant their amended motion for\n11 emergency injunctive relief.\n12 Also, Your Honor, as I did not use my entire 30\n13 minutes, if I may just reserve a few minutes for rebuttal\n14 after the city's argument, I would prefer it.\n15 THE COURT:  You may, but I've got some questions\n16 for you.\n17 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.\n18 THE COURT:  Going back to the park regulation\n19 ordinance and the extension of the time for, I think the\n20 phrase is civic events --\n21 MS. KEESLER:  Yes.\n22 THE COURT:  -- the city argues that they have\n23 interpreted that to include Occupy Fort Myers as a civic\n24 event.  First of all, is that correct?\n25 MS. KEESLER:  Factually, they are enforcing this\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 26 of 68 PageID 454\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     26\n 1 particular ordinance against members of Occupy Fort Myers.\n 2 I believe the city had just indicated that 73 citations have\n 3 been written out on the section of that code -- you know,\n 4 Subsection (a) -- which discusses the exceptions for civic\n 5 events.  So it is being applied to my clients as we speak.\n 6 Additionally, if the city were to say that the\n 7 accommodations were open to everybody, and all types of\n 8 speech, it could have simply said that it was open to\n 9 everybody, and all types of speech, instead of carving out\n10 exceptions for civic and cultural events.\n11 THE COURT:  With regard to the Special Events\n12 Advisory Board issue, what is the authority of that board to\n13 decide things, and to make decisions, as opposed to make, as\n14 the title indicates, advisory opinions?\n15 MS. KEESLER:  The Code gives the Special Events\n16 Advisory Board an advisory capacity for special events.\n17 However, the pamphlet -- the Special Events Pamphlet, which\n18 Plaintiffs filed at approximately 2:00 a.m. this morning,\n19 actually indicates that the Special Events Advisory Board\n20 has the authority to deny permits.  There are no standards,\n21 either within the city's Code or that I could find in the\n22 Special Events Pamphlet, that identify under what authority,\n23 or why they would deny permits; but that authority is listed\n24 in the pamphlet.  And, indeed, in the pamphlet, when it\n25 lists that authority, it says pursuant to Ordinance 30-19,\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 27 of 68 PageID 455\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     27\n 1 which is codified as Section 2-273.\n 2 THE COURT:  So you're saying there's an\n 3 inconsistency between the pamphlet and the ordinance?\n 4 MS. KEESLER:  There is either an inconsistency, or\n 5 there has been authority given to the board that is not\n 6 listed in any of the city ordinances.  Indeed, the final\n 7 subsection of 2-273 -- I don't remember the exact language,\n 8 but I believe it says that the board has any other authority\n 9 given to it by the City Council.  So it may be that it's in\n10 there somewhere.\n11 THE COURT:  And how would one know whether\n12 authority has been given to that?\n13 MS. KEESLER:  I have no idea.\n14 THE COURT:  You're wrong person to ask.\n15 All right.  Let me go back to basics.  Other than\n16 the issues with regard to the parade that we talked about\n17 earlier, what is the 1st Amendment activity that you claim\n18 your clients are entitled to perform that are being impacted\n19 by the park regulation ordinance and the Special Events\n20 Advisory Board ordinance?\n21 MS. KEESLER:  Our clients, in solidarity with\n22 hundreds of similar occupy movements throughout the country,\n23 are participating in a symbolic occupation of the City of\n24 Fort Myers.  What this symbolic occupation is, is it is a\n25 demonstration that's protesting economic unfairness and\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 28 of 68 PageID 456\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     28\n 1 social justice issues.  As part of the symbolic protest,\n 2 which again is occurring in cities throughout the country,\n 3 the Plaintiffs have set up tents to symbolize their\n 4 occupation of the city.  These tents -- at the moment, I\n 5 believe Occupy Fort Myers has approximately 10 to 12 tents\n 6 set up.  However, those individuals demonstrating 24 hours a\n 7 day, in the evening is about four to five every evening\n 8 right now.  So it's mostly a symbolic event.\n 9 Outside of the tents there is an information booth\n10 that's set up, where the Plaintiffs hand out pamphlets; and,\n11 when members of the public stop by and want to talk, they\n12 talk to them about their ideas, their beliefs, and how we\n13 can change our economic system.  This is the speech that I\n14 believe is protected.\n15 THE COURT:  Are your clients claiming that the\n16 1st Amendment encompasses a right to camp?  Or to sleep?\n17 MS. KEESLER:  Not to camp.\n18 THE COURT:  It obviously encompasses the right to\n19 set up information booths, and pass out literature, and talk\n20 about it; but it seems like, in part -- and I want to make\n21 sure that I understand it right -- that they're claiming a\n22 constitutional right to sleep on public property, and to set\n23 up what could be called camping, if they're setting up tents\n24 and living in the tents.\n25 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  The Plaintiffs are\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 29 of 68 PageID 457\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     29\n 1 not claiming that they should be allowed to live in the\n 2 tents or on public property.  As a matter of fact, the\n 3 Plaintiffs tend to rotate in and out.  They go home to\n 4 shower, or go to work, or anything like that.  They live\n 5 their normal lives.\n 6 As far as the issue of sleeping, it is an\n 7 overnight symbolic area, and I . . . will submit that some\n 8 of them fall asleep.  However, in Clark versus Community for\n 9 Creative Nonviolence, the Supreme Court did say, while they\n10 did not completely decide the issue, they assume that\n11 sleeping could be protected under the 1st Amendment if it\n12 was in concert with other symbolic activity.\n13 THE COURT:  So I guess my question is are you\n14 asserting that sleeping is one of those activities that your\n15 clients want to do, and which they assert is protected by\n16 the 1st Amendment?\n17 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.\n18 THE COURT:  Do they cook there?  I mean, you talk\n19 about them rotating in and out, and going home.  Are these\n20 just tents, or are they having bonfires, or cooking meals?\n21 I mean, what is it that, other than the tents, that\n22 constitute occupying?\n23 MS. KEESLER:  They do not have campfires set up.\n24 It is my understanding, from talking with my Plaintiffs,\n25 there was one grill there; however, I believe they did not\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 30 of 68 PageID 458\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     30\n 1 use it.  I believe it was an electric grill.  And the\n 2 electricity was turned off.\n 3 They have volunteer members from the public\n 4 bringing them food to eat during the day or in the evenings.\n 5 And they do not shower in the public restrooms.  They don't\n 6 keep suitcases of clothing there to change.\n 7 THE COURT:  So essentially you have a -- your\n 8 symbolism is the tent, and then people, that may or may not\n 9 be sleeping in it, doing whatever else they do.\n10 MS. KEESLER:  Yes, Your Honor.  The symbolism is\n11 the tent, and there are individuals who protest 24 hours a\n12 day, moving in and out.\n13 THE COURT:  Thank you.\n14 MS. KEESLER:  Thank you, Your Honor.\n15 THE COURT:  Mr. Alley?  Mr. Alley, let me ask you,\n16 first, for the record, to describe Centennial Park.  Those\n17 of us from Fort Myers know what we're talking about, but the\n18 record may not.  I know because I can see it from my office.\n19 But why don't you tell me what you want the record to know\n20 about that park.\n21 MR. ALLEY:  May it please the Court.  Centennial\n22 Park is a gift to the public that was created through the\n23 cooperation of the City of Fort Myers, the State of Florida,\n24 and the federal government, namely the National Park\n25 Service.  The city obtained a grant from the federal\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 31 of 68 PageID 459\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     31\n 1 government which was used in the ability and to facilitate\n 2 the park for the public's use.  The city's been authorized\n 3 to maintain and regulate the ongoing use of the park,\n 4 including shared competing uses in the park; and, in order\n 5 to fulfill the responsibility bestowed upon it, the City of\n 6 Fort Myers has created guidelines and restrictions in order\n 7 to preserve and manage the park and ensure accessibility for\n 8 long-term use by the public.\n 9 The city has to ensure financial accountability\n10 for injuries to persons and/or property caused on the park,\n11 primarily for injuries caused to persons on the park; and\n12 the city has an obligation to coordinate multiple uses of\n13 limited space, and to ensure the preservation of facilities,\n14 prevent damages, and prevent unlawful or impermissible\n15 behavior.\n16 THE COURT:  Do you know the acreage?\n17 MR. ALLEY:  One moment.\n18 I do not know the acreage.\n19 THE COURT:  Does the city actually own the park?\n20 MS. KEESLER:  Yes.\n21 MR. ALLEY:  Yes; the city owns the park.  It is\n22 bordered by the Caloosahatchee River, Heitman Street, and\n23 West First Street, and the city does own the park.  However,\n24 there are grant obligations the city has to meet with\n25 respect to the National Park Service and the federal\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 32 of 68 PageID 460\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     32\n 1 government.\n 2 THE COURT:  When you say grant obligations, you\n 3 mean from the grant that was used to purchase the land that\n 4 the park is on?\n 5 MR. ALLEY:  The federal government gave the city\n 6 some money for the park, and there are grant -- I don't know\n 7 if it was used to actually purchase the land, or if it was\n 8 used to build structures in the park or infrastructure in\n 9 the park.  The park has pavilions, the park has electricity,\n10 the park has staging areas, the park has restrooms.\n11 THE COURT:  And do you know how long that area has\n12 served as a public park?\n13 MR. ALLEY:  I can find out during the course of\n14 this hearing.\n15 THE COURT:  It's probably not essential that I\n16 know that.  I was curious.\n17 Is there any question in your mind that the\n18 Centennial Park is a public forum within the meaning of the\n19 1st Amendment?\n20 MR. ALLEY:  No, Your Honor.  It clearly is a\n21 traditional public forum.\n22 THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead, please.\n23 MR. ALLEY:  In Thomas v. Chicago Park District,\n24 the United States Supreme Court, in 2002, upheld an\n25 ordinance that did not contain procedural safeguards\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 33 of 68 PageID 461\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     33\n 1 applicable to content-based regulations, and they upheld the\n 2 ability of the municipal park ordinance requiring\n 3 individuals to obtain a permit before conducting more than\n 4 50-person events.  That was challenged by the Plaintiffs in\n 5 that case, saying that it was a content-based attack.  A\n 6 content -- a reg -- valid time, place, and manner\n 7 restriction that is content neutral.  \n 8 Even in light of the 11th Circuit's ruling and the\n 9 District Court's ruling in . . . .  Bledsoe v. City of\n10 Jacksonville, the United States Supreme Court and the . . .\n11 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has ruled\n12 that a content neutral time, place, and manner restriction\n13 is subject to the intermediate level of scrutiny; and that\n14 is, if it applies to everybody, if it's narrowly tailored to\n15 achieve a significant government interest and there are\n16 alternative avenues for communication.\n17 Plaintiffs are seeking to strike four sections of\n18 the ordinance, the city ordinances, the code of ordinances.\n19 And I'm referring to Docket Number 10 that says Plaintiffs'\n20 Amended Emergency Motion for Preliminary Injunction and\n21 Request for Expedited Hearing with Incorporated Memorandum\n22 of Law.  Page 2, I read, \"Plaintiffs seek a preliminary\n23 injunction enjoining Defendant City of Fort Myers, its\n24 officers, employees, and agents, from enforcing Fort Myers\n25 City Code provisions challenged in this complaint:\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 34 of 68 PageID 462\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     34\n 1 Specifically, Code Section 2-273, city code Section 58-153\n 2 and 58-156, and city code Section 86-153; or from issuing\n 3 additional criminal penalties to the Plaintiff.\"\n 4 In their wherefore clause in that, they state,\n 5 \"wherefore, Plaintiffs ask this Court to set a hearing, in\n 6 an expedited manner, concerning issuance of a preliminary\n 7 injunction enjoining the City of Fort Myers from enforcing\n 8 city code Section 2-273, 58-153 to 58-156, and 86-153.\"  And\n 9 then it goes on.  The misunderstanding is because, in the\n10 Plaintiffs' pleading, when they specifically cite the Code\n11 section, and in Paragraph 2 they did not reference 58-154.\n12 The City of Fort Myers has park operating rules\n13 and policies and procedures, and it's basically contained --\n14 excuse me.  Under Chapter 58, Titled, \"Parks and\n15 Recreation,\" Article IV is titled, \"Parks and Other\n16 Recreational Facilities.\"  58-131 provides definition.\n17 58-151 provides malicious, disorderly conduct.  58-152\n18 provides sanitation.  And in the case that the -- 58-153,\n19 recreational activity restrictions.  This is a section the\n20 Plaintiff is seeking to enjoin.\n21 58-154, prohibited behavior, this is a section\n22 that the Plaintiff, through their oral arguments on this\n23 emergency hearing, are seeking to enjoin.  And 58-156, park\n24 operating policy, they are seeking to enjoin that.\n25 When you look at 58-153, recreational activity\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 35 of 68 PageID 463\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     35\n 1 restrictions, there are three sections to 58-153.  The first\n 2 section says, \"No unauthorized person in a park shall.\"\n 3 This is Subsection Number 1.  There are three.  \"Swim, dive,\n 4 bathe, or wade in any waters, lakes, ponds, or waterways in\n 5 the city limits, except that such places as are provided and\n 6 designated therefor by signage and in compliance with the\n 7 sign regulations as herein sets forth or may be hereinafter\n 8 adopted.\"  \n 9 And then it goes on to talk about you're not\n10 allowed to swim in the public waters and ponds unless\n11 swimming is permitted, it talks about you're not allowed to\n12 dive head first.  It is prohibited in the city limits\n13 unless -- due to risk of catastrophic injury, except in\n14 athletic diving events or private swimming pools.\n15 No, the city code does not permit head-first\n16 diving for 1st Amendment expression.  \"No person shall\n17 frequent any waters or places customarily designated for\n18 swimming, or bathing, or congregating where such activity is\n19 prohibited by the recreation manager upon a finding that\n20 such use of the water would be dangerous or otherwise\n21 inadvisable.\"\n22 The nucleus of operative facts that the Plaintiffs\n23 have presented in this court in its verified complaint and\n24 its temporary restraining order, and its preliminary\n25 injunction, has nothing to do with swimming, diving, or\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 36 of 68 PageID 464\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     36\n 1 bathing in the waters, and the -- no Plaintiffs have been\n 2 cited for bathing in Centennial Park or for bathing in the\n 3 Caloosahatchee River.\n 4 THE COURT:  Don't you think the Plaintiffs agree?\n 5 What I heard is that, basically, to the extent that that is\n 6 set forth in their prior papers, they were abandoning that\n 7 issue?  Sounds like they probably didn't really intend to\n 8 bring it in the first place, but to the extent they did,\n 9 certainly seems to me that they're abandoning any claim\n10 about swimming in the public parks.  Do you not see it that\n11 way?\n12 MR. ALLEY:  It's in their pleadings that they want\n13 to strike 58-153.  It doesn't say 58-153, Section 3, it says\n14 58-153; and it contains three sections.\n15 THE COURT:  And you don't think she's bound by\n16 what she told me earlier today, that what she wants is\n17 58-153(3)?\n18 MR. ALLEY:  Your Honor, I was paying attention to\n19 something else.  If she's dropping 58-153(1) and (2), I\n20 won't address them.\n21 THE COURT:  Let me verify that.  That's my sense\n22 of what they did.\n23 MS. KEESLER:  Yes.  Plaintiffs' stipulate that we\n24 only seeks to enjoin sections of the Code that pertain to\n25 content-based, overbroad, or vague issues; specifically,\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 37 of 68 PageID 465\nARGUMENT BY MS. KEESLER     37\n 1 58-153, Subsection 3; 58-154, Subsection 6; and all of\n 2 58-156.\n 3 THE COURT:  All right.  That's what my notes say,\n 4 as well.\n 5 MR. ALLEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.\n 6 58-152, recreation activity restrictions,\n 7 Section 3.  The Code provides no unauthorized person in the\n 8 park shall set up tents, shacks, or other temporary shelters\n 9 for the purpose of overnight camping.  No person shall live\n10 in a park beyond the closing hours in any moveable structure\n11 or special vehicle to be used or that could be used for such\n12 camping purpose, such as a tent, house trailer, camp\n13 trailer, camp wagon, or the like.\n14 This rule is not aimed at -- it does not target\n15 political speech, it does not apply to favored speakers, and\n16 exempts -- it does not -- the rule isn't exempted for\n17 favored speakers and applied to non-favored speakers.  That\n18 would clearly be unconstitutional.  This is -- on its face,\n19 the rule applies to everybody.  You are not allowed to set\n20 up temporary or permanent living structures, you can't live\n21 in the park, and you can't camp in the park overnight.\n22 The Plaintiff argues that, because there are\n23 possibilities for exemptions to camp in the park, or to stay\n24 overnight in the park, that that renders those regulations\n25 facially invalid because it makes them content based and\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 38 of 68 PageID 466\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     38\n 1 therefore would have to survive the strict scrutiny\n 2 standard.\n 3 The affidavit filed by the public works director,\n 4 Documents Number 24 and 25 for the record, of Saeed Kazemi,\n 5 provides that the City of Fort Myers has, in the past,\n 6 extended operating hours for events such as Occupy Fort\n 7 Myers, as well as the Cancer Relay for Life events.  The\n 8 city has permitted Occupy Fort Myers to camp in the park,\n 9 and the city has permitted Relay for Life to camp in the\n10 park, as evidenced by the affidavit of Mr. Kazemi.  But it's\n11 not for an indefinite period of time.  It can't go on\n12 forever.  It can't be kept a secret of how long protestors\n13 plan to live in the park.  They are not allowed to live in\n14 the park.\n15 This is not about esthetics and beauty only.  This\n16 is about fundamental aspects of safety.  Setting up\n17 temporary structures in a public park, and anywhere else in\n18 the city, you have to get permits to see if the design is\n19 safe.  You have to get permits to make sure that the\n20 electricity, the application of electricity to the\n21 structures, is safe.  You have to apply for permits.  And\n22 there are regulations regarding building codes that have to\n23 be -- have to be at least looked at with respect to\n24 safety -- health, safety, and welfare of the -- not only the\n25 people camping or living in the park, but also innocent\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 39 of 68 PageID 467\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     39\n 1 bystanders that choose to also share and use the park.\n 2 The Plaintiffs have, in oral arguments, stated,\n 3 58-154, they're not seeking to strike any section but\n 4 Section 6, the loitering and boisterousness, sleep,\n 5 protractively lounge; and then 58-156, park operating hours,\n 6 hours (a), and hours in Section (b) is closed areas.\n 7 The government has a compelling government\n 8 interest in being able to close its parks, and the\n 9 compelling government interest is we -- the city owns the\n10 land, it was a gift to the city, Centennial Park, in\n11 particular, was a gift to the city.  But these regulations\n12 they're asking to strike aren't just Centennial Park.  These\n13 are all the city parks.  This isn't limited to Centennial\n14 Park.  This is limited to parks where there aren't\n15 pavilions.  They are not limiting their occupation of a park\n16 like Centennial Park, they are asking the Court to enjoin\n17 the parks -- all of the recreation facilities.\n18 The title of 58-156 -- the title of 58-153 says,\n19 \"Recreation Activity Restrictions,\" and it talks about it\n20 doesn't limit -- it's not limited to Centennial Park only.\n21 And the city has parks that have nothing but playground\n22 equipment for kids.  And that park is different than\n23 Centennial Park.  Centennial Park has pavilions.  Centennial\n24 Park is a larger park.  But what they're asking this Court\n25 to enjoin is a city from enforcing its regulations on all of\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 40 of 68 PageID 468\nARGUMENT BY MR.

And there's no facts presented where overnight\n 3 camping, or living, or staying beyond park hours of\n 4 operation, would be -- would be safe.\n 5 THE COURT:  How many parks does the city operate?\n 6 MR. ALLEY:  I believe the city has over two dozen\n 7 parks.  Some of the parks are strictly designed for\n 8 children.  They have playground equipment, swing sets,\n 9 slides.  Some of the parks are passive parks, with picnic\n10 benches and cooking grills.  And some of the parks have\n11 large staging events and areas, and pavilions.\n12 The park operating policy establishes hours.  The\n13 city has a compelling government interest in being able to\n14 establish the hours of the park.  The Plaintiff had -- and\n15 the park's operating hours are from 6:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.\n16 unless otherwise -- unless posted otherwise by the\n17 recreation manager.\n18 The city -- the code provides that the hours shall\n19 be deemed extended by the recreation manager as necessary to\n20 accommodate athletic sports events or cultural or civic\n21 activities.  If you look up the word \"Civic\" in a\n22 dictionary, it's of or relating to a citizen, or of or\n23 relating to a city.  It includes the -- it includes\n24 protests.\n25 Occupy now has been given extended hours in the\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 41 of 68 PageID 469\nARGUMENT BY MR.

The affidavit of the chief shows\n 4 when -- illustrates when the tickets were first started,\n 5 when the city first started writing tickets for violation of\n 6 58-156.  All but three were written for (a), staying beyond\n 7 the hours.  Three tickets . . . in the amended affidavit we\n 8 filed this morning, of the chief of police, three tickets\n 9 were for the closed areas.\n10 My written brief, the city's written brief says\n11 that -- argues that (b) should be -- isn't in issue because\n12 no tickets were written on (b).  And we correct that this\n13 morning in our oral arguments from our brief.  We did\n14 write -- the city did write three tickets for\n15 Section 58-156(b).\n16 As of October 26th, there were 73 citations for --\n17 and those citations, all but three of them were limited to a\n18 violation of 58-153(3), and that is the prohibition on\n19 setting up shelters or camping or living in the park against\n20 the rules; and 58-156(a), which is the park hours.  And I'd\n21 like to address the Court on the park hours.\n22 6:00 to 10:30.  The Plaintiffs can express their\n23 1st Amendment conduct and expression between the hours\n24 of 6:00 to 10:30 every day, any day that they want to.

ALLEY:  Your Honor, I look to the -- I look to\n10 the case law to answer that.  And I note that the Supreme\n11 Court made that assumption when they upheld a sleeping ban\n12 in Clark.\n13 THE COURT:  So what's your position?  More\n14 particularly, what's the city's position?\n15 MR. ALLEY:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  The city's\n16 position on whether sleeping is expressive conduct?\n17 THE COURT:  In this case, does the city concede\n18 that camping, setting up tents, sleeping in the park, in\n19 this context, all qualify as expressive conduct?\n20 MR. ALLEY:  No.  The city does not agree that the\n21 setting up of structures is expressive conduct.  The city\n22 does not agree that camping is expressive conduct protected\n23 by the 1st Amendment under the strict scrutiny or\n24 intermediate scrutiny task.\n25 THE COURT:  Tell me why.  Because if you're right,\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 43 of 68 PageID 471\nARGUMENT BY MR.

So why isn't, in the context of\n 3 Occupy Fort Myers, setting up a tent, and sleeping, and\n 4 camping, symbolic expressive speech?\n 5 MR. ALLEY:  Living is not symbolic expressive\n 6 speech.  Camping is an act.  It's not symbolic expressive\n 7 speech.  The Plaintiffs argue that it's expressive conduct.\n 8 Under the Plaintiffs' argument, everything is expressive\n 9 conduct.  Under the Plaintiffs' argument, when I get up in\n10 the morning, and I put my pants on, I'm expressing conduct.\n11 But there has to be some limitations prescribed on what\n12 conduct is expressive and what conduct is not expressive\n13 with respect to what the 1st Amendment affords, what\n14 protections the 1st Amendment affords.\n15 What we're talking about here, Your Honor, are\n16 freedoms.  And it's critical to protect the 1st Amendment.\n17 The 1st Amendment is one of the greatest amendments in our\n18 federal constitution and in our state constitution, but\n19 there is some expressive conduct that is not protected by\n20 the 1st Amendment; and the Plaintiffs allegation that living\n21 in a park is expressive --\n22 THE COURT:  You said there is some expressive\n23 conduct that is not protected by the amended motion.  Did\n24 you mean that?\n25 MR. ALLEY:  Under the Plaintiffs' . . . no.  No.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 44 of 68 PageID 472\nARGUMENT BY MR.

Putting -- tying my shoes is\n 4 expressive conduct under the Plaintiffs' analysis.  That's\n 5 not expressive conduct that's protected by the\n 6 1st Amendment.\n 7 The Supreme Court assumed that it is expressive\n 8 conduct to have homeless -- for the homeless to sleep in a\n 9 park.  They assumed that.  And when the Plaintiffs -- when\n10 the demonstrators wanted to set up tents that could\n11 basically provide sleeping quarters for approximately up to\n12 150 homeless individuals, the Supreme Court made an\n13 assumption that it's expressive conduct.  They did not find\n14 it as expressive conduct, but they made that assumption.\n15 The city is not conceding that camping is\n16 expressive conduct.  The city is saying that living in\n17 Centennial Park is not expressive conduct.  The city --\n18 THE COURT:  Go ahead.  \n19 MR. ALLEY:  The city is saying that camping in\n20 Centennial Park is not expressive conduct.  The city is\n21 saying that the express -- and the city is also saying that\n22 the Plaintiffs are able to camp in Centennial Park while the\n23 park is -- they can do their symbolic camping in the park\n24 while the park is open, 16 and a half hours out of 24 hours\n25 a day.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 45 of 68 PageID 473\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     45\n 1 It's disingenuous to tell this Court that it's a\n 2 symbolic 24-hour protest.  It's not.  It's an unlimited,\n 3 indefinite, with no limit -- a secret on how long it's to\n 4 be.  When we argue why the Plaintiffs should have to post a\n 5 bond, we don't know what -- if it's a year, the bond should\n 6 be a lot higher than if it's a week or two weeks.  We don't\n 7 know how long they want to live in Centennial Park.\n 8 THE COURT:  Did you find any cases that has held\n 9 that things like sleeping and camping are not expressive\n10 conduct protected by the 1st Amendment?\n11 MR. ALLEY:  We got the emergency -- we got the\n12 court order on, I believe, Wednesday or Thursday, and . . .\n13 we weren't watching the Eagles beat the Cowboys last night\n14 at 11:30.  We were able to file by midnight, and give\n15 opposing counsel a copy of our brief.  But no, we have not\n16 fully briefed this issue.\n17 THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.  It seems to me\n18 there are a number of cases that, like the Supreme Court in\n19 Clark, assumed such conduct was within the 1st Amendment,\n20 and then, for the most part, addressed the validity of the\n21 regulation.  I was wondering whether you found any case --\n22 it's not intuitive that sleeping is expressive conduct, no\n23 matter what the Supreme Court has assumed.  So I was just\n24 wondering what you had found.\n25 All right.  Go ahead.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 46 of 68 PageID 474\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     46\n 1 MR. ALLEY:  In Clark, the United States Supreme\n 2 Court stated, \"It is urged by the respondents, and the Court\n 3 of Appeals was of this view, that the symbolic city of tents\n 4 was to be permitted if demonstrators did not intend to cook,\n 5 dig, or engage in aspects of camping other than sleeping.\n 6 The incremental benefit to the parks could not justify the\n 7 ban on sleeping, which was here an expressive activity, and\n 8 which\" -- I'm sorry.  \"Which was here an expressive activity\n 9 said to enhance the message concerning the plight of the\n10 poor and homeless.\n11 \"We cannot agree.\"  This is the United States\n12 Supreme Court talking.  \"We cannot agree.  In the first\n13 place, we seriously doubt that the 1st Amendment requires a\n14 park service to permit a demonstration in Lafayette Park and\n15 the mall involving a 24-hour vigil and the erection of tents\n16 to accommodate 150 people.\n17 \"Furthermore, although we have assumed, for\n18 present purposes, that a sleeping ban in this case would\n19 have an expressive element, it is evident that its major\n20 value to this demonstration for this would be facilitative.\n21 Without a permit to sleep, it would be difficult to get the\n22 poor and homeless to participate, or be present at all.\"\n23 486 U.S. 288, 104 Supreme Court 3065.\n24 There the Supreme Court assumed that it was\n25 expressive, but the Supreme Court did not agree.  And here\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 47 of 68 PageID 475\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     47\n 1 they're trying to strike the park -- they're trying to\n 2 overturn the ban on setting up temporary . . . tents,\n 3 shacks, or otherwise temporary shelters, overnight camping,\n 4 living in a park beyond closing hours, or using moveable --\n 5 or putting moveable structures in the park.  The sleeping\n 6 ban was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n 7 Now to the park operating policy, the hours.  16\n 8 and half hours out of 24 hours a day, they can do any\n 9 expressive conduct and expressive speech they want.  Their\n10 argument is that the city, because there's a nonexclusive\n11 way to get an extension in the code to extend park hours --\n12 Occupy now got extended park hours, Cancer -- the Cancer\n13 Relay for Life got extended park hours -- because there are\n14 nonexclusive methods to extend park hours, that the Court\n15 should render this a content-based restriction and strike\n16 it.  Or enjoin it.\n17 If the Court is of that mind, the Court -- as the\n18 Court knows, Florida law favors severability.  The Florida\n19 Supreme Court and the federal courts recognize this as a\n20 federal doctrine, recognizing the obligation of the\n21 judiciary to uphold the constitutionality of legislative\n22 enactments where possible, to strike only the\n23 unconstitutional portion.  \n24 There is a four-part test in Florida, as the\n25 federal courts recognize, as this Court knows, that was\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 48 of 68 PageID 476\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     48\n 1 identified in the Solantic v. Neptune Beach in the 11th\n 2 Circuit Court of Appeals in 2005.  Can the language -- the\n 3 unconstitutional provisions be separated from the\n 4 constitutional provisions?  Does the legislative purpose\n 5 remain intact?  Can the Court determine what the legislative\n 6 intent would be?  What the governing body would do if those\n 7 provisions were separated out.  And then, what's left, is\n 8 that an act, complete and of itself, remains after the\n 9 severance.\n10 The intention of the city counsel, is identified\n11 in the city code that says, basically, it's hereby declared\n12 to be intent of the city counsel that these sections,\n13 paragraphs sentences, clauses, and phrases of the code are\n14 severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph,\n15 or section of this code shall be declared unconstitutional\n16 by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent\n17 jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any\n18 other remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs in\n19 the sections of this code, since same would have been\n20 enacted by the City Council without the incorporation in\n21 this code of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause,\n22 sentence, paragraph or section.\n23 THE COURT:  Well, before you get into severance,\n24 let me get you back to whether the hours provision is\n25 content based.  If it is content based, that doesn't\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 49 of 68 PageID 477\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     49\n 1 necessarily make it unconstitutional, that just tells me to\n 2 apply a different test.  Is it your view that that provision\n 3 is not content based?\n 4 MR. ALLEY:  Yes.  You cannot read this -- the city\n 5 is at a loss as to how the Plaintiff can argue with a\n 6 straight face that this is content-based.  \n 7 Hours.  Park operating policy.  \"Except for\n 8 unusual and unforeseen emergencies, parks shall be open to\n 9 the public every day of the year during designated hours.\n10 The opening and closing hours shall be posted for public\n11 information.  Normal park hours are 6:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.\n12 unless posted otherwise by the recreation manager.  Such\n13 hours shall be deemed extended by the recreation manager as\n14 necessary to accommodate athletic sports events, or cultural\n15 or civic activities.\"\n16 THE COURT:  Isn't the last sentence the part that\n17 Plaintiffs say makes it content based because the recreation\n18 manager has to decide whether a particular event falls\n19 within any of those categories?\n20 MR. ALLEY:  The Plaintiffs' position is that that\n21 section adds language.  And I'm reading from Page 10 of\n22 Document Number 10.  The Plaintiff states, \"Fort Myers City\n23 Code 86-152 prohibits any parade\" -- let me get to . . . .\n24 \"Further, Fort Myers City Code 58-156\" -- that's what we're\n25 talking about -- \"Governing park policy, by its terms,\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 50 of 68 PageID 478\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     50\n 1 targets all political speech and conduct to be burdened with\n 2 the requirement of shutting down at 10:30 p.m. or not\n 3 beginning by 6:30 a.m.\"  The hours are 6:00 to 10:30,\n 4 not 6:30; but that's not the point.\n 5 The point is it says, \"While exempting athletic\n 6 events, cultural and civic activities,\" and then the\n 7 Plaintiff adds, \"And other nonpolitical association and\n 8 assembly.\"  That's not in the code.  That language isn't\n 9 there.  It says while --\n10 THE COURT:  I heard what you read, what was in the\n11 code.  I read your brief.  I know she added language that's\n12 not there.  Dealing with language that is there, how is that\n13 not content based when someone has to decide whether the\n14 event that is proposing to be permitted there, or is taking\n15 place there, is a civic event, or a sporting event, or a\n16 cultural event?  Someone has to make that decision.  Doesn't\n17 that inherently make it content based?\n18 MR. ALLEY:  No.  No.  The fact that city\n19 officials, or government officials, or persons of authority\n20 have to make decisions interpreting codes does not render\n21 them content-based regulations.  That has to be -- that --\n22 government officials have to make decisions regulating codes\n23 every day of the year, hundreds of times a day, all across\n24 the country.  And, no, the fact that a government official\n25 has to make that decision does not render it -- does not\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 51 of 68 PageID 479\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     51\n 1 make it a targeted political speech and put it under a\n 2 content-based regulation.  Or to content-based scrutiny\n 3 level by the Court.\n 4 THE COURT:  Somebody has to decide the content of\n 5 the event.  Someone has to decide whether it's a sporting\n 6 event, a cultural event or a civic event.  Don't they?\n 7 MR. ALLEY:  Yes.  Yes, they do.  Somebody does\n 8 have to make that decision.\n 9 THE COURT:  Doesn't that make it content based\n10 then?  Unless those are the only three possibilities in the\n11 world.\n12 MR. ALLEY:  Of or relating to a city covers\n13 everything because it is a city park.\n14 THE COURT:  So that is meaningless.  So what\n15 you're saying is, under that provision, every event of any\n16 description is within the phrase, \"Civic event\".\n17 MR. ALLEY:  Under the affidavit filed by the\n18 public works director, Docket Number 25, he specifically\n19 states Section 58-156 of the Fort Myers City Code does not\n20 exclude any categories of events seeking to extend the\n21 operating park -- the operating hours of the park.  So the\n22 Court is correct.\n23 THE COURT:  So, no matter what the event was, it\n24 would qualify for an extension under the ordinance.\n25 MR. ALLEY:  It would qualify for consideration of\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 52 of 68 PageID 480\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     52\n 1 extension under the ordinance.\n 2 THE COURT:  And then what does the recreation\n 3 manager use to decide whether to grant that extension.\n 4 MR. ALLEY:  The recreation manager applies the\n 5 rules of the park and the recreation activities under the\n 6 city code, the parks and recreation.  Competing interests\n 7 for the park.  Which park is it?  What are they actually\n 8 applying for?  What hours do they want an extension for?\n 9 As in the case of Occupy now, they were granted\n10 hours to go 24/7 until it became clear that they weren't\n11 going to be getting -- or they were challenging permit --\n12 getting insurance to cover personal injury damage to any of\n13 their participants, or to innocent bystanders, or to cover\n14 property damage.\n15 The park -- the parks and recs manager has to make\n16 a number of determinations.  Has anyone else rented the park\n17 for that day?  Is anyone else using the park for that day?\n18 Can we provide police services?  It's a standard interaction\n19 between somebody who wants to go to the property owner and\n20 ask if they can stay beyond the hours of closing, and the\n21 determination is made in the management of the facility.\n22 THE COURT:  Has the city ever denied an extension\n23 to a group because it wasn't one of those three categories\n24 of events?\n25 MR. ALLEY:  The city has denied extensions of\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 53 of 68 PageID 481\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     53\n 1 hours going for 24 hours.  The city is denying that right,\n 2 now, to Occupy.  To the Plaintiffs.  But the city has never\n 3 denied consideration for extended hours.\n 4 THE COURT:  So essentially you're saying that last\n 5 sentence really has no meaning, because the city will\n 6 consider any request for extension?\n 7 MR. ALLEY:  I'm not arguing that it has no\n 8 meaning.  There is legislative intent behind it.  It says,\n 9 \"Such hours shall be deemed extended by the manager as\n10 necessary to accommodate,\" and then it says, \"Athletic ports\n11 events, or cultural or civic activities.\"  And those\n12 athletic sports events, or cultural or civic activities\n13 covers everything.\n14 THE COURT:  So what you're saying is what it could\n15 have said is to accommodate any event.\n16 MR. ALLEY:  Yes.\n17 THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.\n18 MR. ALLEY:  The fact that it's possible for a\n19 government official to favor some speakers, and grant\n20 exemption to favored speakers, and to deny exceptions to the\n21 rules to unfavored speakers, because that's possible, and\n22 that clearly would be unconstitutional because that's\n23 possible, that doesn't render a -- the regulation content\n24 based, and provide it in the highest tier of scrutiny by\n25 this Court.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 54 of 68 PageID 482\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     54\n 1 In the Chicago Park case, the United States\n 2 Supreme Court, in 2002 -- this is the case where they upheld\n 3 a 50-person event -- the Supreme Court said, \"Granting\n 4 waivers to favored speakers, denying them to disfavored\n 5 speakers, would, of course, be unconstitutional; but we\n 6 think that this abuse must be dealt with if and when a\n 7 pattern of unlawful favoritism appears, rather than by\n 8 insisting upon a degree of rigidity that is found in few\n 9 legal arrangements. On Plaintiffs' theory,\" and then it goes\n10 on to criticize the Plaintiffs' theory\".\n11 The Plaintiff can't show any evidence, there is no\n12 evidence, that the city is favoring some parties and not\n13 favoring another.  In the Plaintiffs' own verified complaint\n14 they are acknowledging they were able to stay in the park\n15 beyond the park hours.  They have been occupying the park\n16 for weeks.\n17 There are alternatives.  The Plaintiffs can\n18 express themselves, and express their symbolic camping, and\n19 express their -- whatever . . . whatever their message is,\n20 they can express that 16 and a half hours a day out of a\n21 24-day -- out of a 24-hour day.  There are ample\n22 alternatives.\n23 And it's not only expressive conduct.  They also\n24 have commercial speech here.  They're soliciting donations.\n25 They're soliciting material.  This isn't -- this isn't all\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 55 of 68 PageID 483\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     55\n 1 about complaining about their social injustices worldwide,\n 2 or infinite complaints about social ills worldwide.  This is\n 3 also soliciting.  Please bring us supplies, please bring\n 4 us . . . it's commercial speech.  They're making\n 5 solicitations that are covered under a completely separate\n 6 portion of the code that you're not supposed to use the\n 7 public lands to solicit money or to -- for your\n 8 organization, or to solicit supplies.\n 9 THE COURT:  Are they in violation of any city\n10 ordinance during the 16 and a half hours or so that the park\n11 is open?\n12 MR. ALLEY:  The setting up of structures and the\n13 setting up of tents is not permitted in the park.  You can\n14 get a Special Events Permit for it, and the Special Events\n15 Permit requires a description of what you plan on setting up\n16 and where you plan on setting it up.  Do you plan on digging\n17 into the ground and possibly hitting wires?  How big is the\n18 structure going to be?  And, if it's a large structure, it\n19 gets inspected.  It gets inspected to make sure it doesn't\n20 fall on somebody.  It gets inspected to make sure the\n21 electric outlets are fine.\n22 It's just not -- the 1st Amendment doesn't afford\n23 somebody the right to go up and set up a structure in a park\n24 and -- an unsafe structure.  They believe it's safe when\n25 they set it up, but an unsafe structure.  And it doesn't\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 56 of 68 PageID 484\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     56\n 1 protect that.\n 2 THE COURT:  You said they could set up their\n 3 symbolic tenting, I forget your exact phrase, but almost\n 4 anywhere.  Is that literally true?  Where can they set up\n 5 tents in the City of Fort Myers other than a public park?\n 6 MR. ALLEY:  The city did not provide -- the city\n 7 has areas zoned where camping is permitted, but city-owned\n 8 property?  The city does not provide campgrounds for\n 9 residents at this time.  And it's not because the city's\n10 anti-camping, it's simply because this is -- the public\n11 lands are limited lands, and there's a higher priority of\n12 use for playgrounds, passive parks, and other recreation\n13 parks.  The city does not have a campground park; however,\n14 the city does accommodate camping through zoning.\n15 The Plaintiffs would argue that they can -- they\n16 can set up tents on public rights of way, or tents on\n17 sidewalks.  And that issue has yet to be litigated.  The\n18 state laws provide, and the city code provides, that you\n19 cannot obstruct the sidewalks.  So that issue has to be\n20 litigated.  If it's a tent large enough for a human being,\n21 and the sidewalk is big enough, then that's a different\n22 issue than if the sidewalk is a difficult sidewalk, and\n23 they're setting up a tent on the sidewalk.\n24 THE COURT:  Okay.\n25 MR. ALLEY:  Another section that they're striking\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 57 of 68 PageID 485\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     57\n 1 is 58-156(b), and that's closed areas.  The city has a\n 2 compelling -- and three tickets have been written for the\n 3 closed areas.  The city has a compelling government interest\n 4 and it would survive the strict scrutiny standard were the\n 5 Court to find this content based.  And the city believes\n 6 it's content neutral, and it's in the intermedial level of\n 7 scrutiny by this Court; but, irrespective of that, the city\n 8 believes that it's -- they have a compelling interest in the\n 9 ability to open and close its parks.  Or a portion of their\n10 parks.\n11 No, the city can't close a park to prevent\n12 political speech; but the city has a compelling interest to\n13 closing a park that has electrical problems, or where\n14 there's going to be a capital improvement built, like a\n15 pavilion maintained, or a pavilion built, or something along\n16 those lines.\n17 The violations section of these codes provides for\n18 a violation for a fine between $25 and $250, and the\n19 Plaintiffs allege that it's a criminal citation.  In Thomas\n20 v. State, the Supreme Court has said that municipal\n21 violation ordinances are not noncriminal, but they are not\n22 criminal either.  So what it is, is it's a municipal\n23 ordinance violation citation.\n24 THE COURT:  Can you go to jail?\n25 MR. ALLEY:  Not from the city code.  There are\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 58 of 68 PageID 486\nARGUMENT BY MR.

It does not have a municipal\n 4 jail now.  There are references to the municipal jail in the\n 5 city code.\n 6 THE COURT:  But for any of the violations issued\n 7 to people involved in this case, is there the possibility of\n 8 jail time?\n 9 MR. ALLEY:  Not under the city code.\n10 THE COURT:  That's what the citations were issued\n11 under; correct.\n12 MR. ALLEY:  I don't see.  Yes.\n13 THE COURT:  All right.\n14 MR. ALLEY:  The next section the Plaintiffs are\n15 seeking to strike is Section 2-273, which is the Special\n16 Events Advisory Board.  This is a group of volunteer\n17 citizens that are appointed by the City Council to make\n18 advisory recommendations to city officials to make, and\n19 rendering the decisions that they make, to make advisory\n20 recommendations to the City Council, and what type of events\n21 would be good for the City of Fort Myers, and what type of\n22 events would be bad for the City of Fort Myers, and to\n23 make -- and the events -- for events over 1,000 people.\n24 It's not applicable here.  Even on their best day\n25 it's 500 people in their verified complaint, and they're\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 59 of 68 PageID 487\nARGUMENT BY MR.

And when -- in permitting an event,\n10 that's exactly what a property owner does.  They sit back\n11 and they say okay, these events, this event is an event I\n12 would like in the City of Fort Myers.\n13 When the City of Fort Myers decides to put a\n14 pavilion in the city park, they sit down, and city officials\n15 sit back, and they make a decision we want to put a pavilion\n16 there because we want shelter.  We don't like the fact that\n17 there is not shelter there.  We want to put shelters up.\n18 When we put a playground in a park, we make a decision, a\n19 government official makes a decision, we don't want this a\n20 passive park for sporting events.  We want this to have\n21 playground facilities for children to play on.  The city\n22 makes those types of decisions every day.\n23 And for an appointed board -- an unpaid, appointed\n24 board that makes recommendations on what type of events they\n25 would like to see in the city, and this is what type of\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 60 of 68 PageID 488\nARGUMENT BY MR.

The ordinance facially speaks\n 4 for itself.  They cannot deny a permit.  That authority\n 5 doesn't rest with that board.  They can make\n 6 recommendations.\n 7 There are city officials every day, across this\n 8 country, that make recommendations, and individuals that\n 9 make recommendations, that are not constitutional.  The fact\n10 of the matter that they're making a recommendation that's\n11 not constitutional does not render the city's regulation or\n12 the action the city is taking as unconstitutional.  That\n13 happens every day, in every city in this country, where\n14 people make recommendations on things that are bad ideas.\n15 It doesn't comply with state law, doesn't comply with the\n16 city code, or doesn't comply with federal law.\n17 THE COURT:  So what does this Special Events\n18 Advisory Board do that is binding on the city, if anything?\n19 MR. ALLEY:  Absolutely nothing.  It actually is an\n20 extra shield, or an extra layer of review of decisions made\n21 by city officials, and their criteria is outlined and\n22 specified for what type of events that they review based on\n23 size, based on what type of commercial activity it brings to\n24 the city, what type of benefits it brings to the city, are\n25 they -- is it Cancer for Life, those types of situations.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 61 of 68 PageID 489\nARGUMENT BY MR.

Their\n 5 decision is not binding on anybody.  It's an advisory board\n 6 by its express terms.\n 7 THE COURT:  Does it carry any extra weight in\n 8 comparison with somebody else who may call and express an\n 9 opinion?\n10 MR. ALLEY:  It depends on the subject.  The\n11 person -- or the entity, if it's a City Council, which the\n12 code provides for an appeal of any person aggrieved by\n13 decision of any city official, you can appeal it to the City\n14 Council.  It's their subjective weight that they give it.\n15 They don't have to -- it's not a -- it's not a -- if they\n16 vote -- if special events recommends no, you must say no,\n17 it's not that, for the City Council to say yes, they must\n18 get the Special Events Advisory Board to say yes.\n19 What they do is they give advice and they make\n20 recommendations.  They have no decision-making authority.\n21 In some cases it may carry weight, and in some cases it may\n22 not carry weight.\n23 But the Plaintiffs are asking for more than just\n24 striking Section 2-273, because if you strike that\n25 section -- 2-271 is a purpose creation, membership, terms,\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 62 of 68 PageID 490\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     62\n 1 vacancies, qualifications, nonvoting meeting attendees; and\n 2 Section 2-272, is the oaths, officers, records, meetings,\n 3 quorum attendance, and minutes.  Those two sections, if you\n 4 strike the powers and duties of the Special Events Advisory\n 5 Board, you're in affect rendering those two sections of the\n 6 code without meaning and effect, because if they have no\n 7 powers and authorities, then those other two sections have\n 8 no meaning and effect.\n 9 What the Special Events Advisory Board is, is it's\n10 a determination by the legislative branch of the City of\n11 Fort Myers that they want an advisory board to give advice\n12 and recommendations to various city officials, and to\n13 themselves, the governing body, on special events.  And on\n14 issues related to special events.  And there is a separation\n15 of powers.\n16 It's well settled in court, and this Court has\n17 recognized in thousands of cases with respect to the\n18 separation of powers between the judiciary and the\n19 legislature, and creating an advisory board with no\n20 authority other than to make recommendations doesn't violate\n21 any federal laws even if they're making recommendations that\n22 don't comport -- even if they're making a recommendation\n23 that doesn't comport to federal law.\n24 And, in their powers and duties section that the\n25 Plaintiff is seeking to strike, there is a clause that says\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 63 of 68 PageID 491\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     63\n 1 recommend regulations for the conduct of special events that\n 2 will increase interests therein to the citizens, residents,\n 3 and visitors to the city generally, insofar as the same are\n 4 not in conflict with city code and state statutes.\n 5 In and of itself, their express powers have a\n 6 prophylactic protection against violating state statutes.\n 7 To strike the Special Events Advisory Board would be\n 8 basically to render two other sections of the code that\n 9 they're not asking for meaningless, and it would not offer\n10 any relief to the Plaintiff either.  The Special Events\n11 Advisory Board doesn't make the decisions.  So striking the\n12 Special Events Advisory Board doesn't -- someone has to make\n13 a decision.  Some city official has to make a decision.\n14 THE COURT:  What is the procedure for the\n15 Plaintiffs to challenge the decision of whatever official it\n16 is to either deny the permit or to deny a waiver of the\n17 insurance requirement?\n18 MR. ALLEY:  Some provisions of the code outline\n19 and specific procedure.  Other provisions of the code, you\n20 go to the City Manager, who is the chief administrative\n21 officer under the city charter.\n22 THE COURT:  Tell me how it works for this.\n23 MR. ALLEY:  I'm sorry?\n24 THE COURT:  Tell me how it works for this.\n25 MR. ALLEY:  If somebody on Section 2-273?\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 64 of 68 PageID 492\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     64\n 1 THE COURT:  No.  I'm sorry.  If the Plaintiffs are\n 2 dissatisfied with the city's decision not to waive the\n 3 insurance requirement, and are dissatisfied with the\n 4 decision not to issue a permit, how do they challenge that?\n 5 MR. ALLEY:  They can come before the City Council\n 6 and so state what you stated, and say we would like to have\n 7 the insurance requirement waived, and here is what we would\n 8 like.  And City Council, the governing body, can make the\n 9 decision.\n10 THE COURT:  And where is that set forth in the\n11 code?\n12 MR. ALLEY:  The city code is adopted by the City\n13 Council.  In some cases, there are specified provisions for\n14 appeal; but, as a matter of general law, any decision made\n15 under the city code, unless otherwise prescribed, is\n16 appealable to the City Council.\n17 THE COURT:  When you say general law, do you have\n18 a cite for me?\n19 MR. ALLEY:  The City Council can waive their code.\n20 A Florida statute section -- the home rule powers.  I\n21 believe it's Florida Statute 163, it may be 166.  It's the\n22 home rule powers.  The City Council has the authority to\n23 amend its code.\n24 THE COURT:  What does that have to do with\n25 appealing?  They're not asking you to -- well, maybe they\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 65 of 68 PageID 493\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     65\n 1 are asking to you amend the code, but in terms of the\n 2 decision as to whether they get a permit or not, all they're\n 3 asking is for the permit.\n 4 MR. ALLEY:  They can come before the City Council\n 5 and say we have applied for a permit, and the city said we\n 6 need to have insurance, and we don't want to have insurance.\n 7 We would like the City Council to approve this without\n 8 insurance.\n 9 THE COURT:  That's what I'm asking, what is the\n10 cite that says that?\n11 MR. ALLEY:  It's the home rule powers.  The\n12 Florida Supreme Court -- the Florida Constitution was\n13 amended in 1969 and in 1973, and what it did is, previously\n14 the powers of a municipality had to be expressly granted to\n15 the municipality by the state government; and, with the\n16 enactment of the home rule powers constitutional revision,\n17 the government has all authority and powers unless\n18 specifically preempted by the state.\n19 THE COURT:  So that says that anytime a citizen is\n20 unhappy with the decision of the city official, he or she\n21 can file an appeal with the City Council?\n22 MR. ALLEY:  No, Your Honor, it does not expressly\n23 say that.\n24 THE COURT:  That's what I'm looking for.  You're\n25 saying that's what happened.  Now tell me, if I'm their\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 66 of 68 PageID 494\nARGUMENT BY MR. ALLEY     66\n 1 lawyer, where do I find that?  Where do I find their\n 2 appellate process that they go through?\n 3 MR. ALLEY:  The four sections that are seeking to\n 4 enjoin the appellate process is not outlined in the code.\n 5 THE COURT:  Does that mean there is no appellate\n 6 process?\n 7 MR. ALLEY:  There is.  They can appeal to the City\n 8 Council.  They can come to the City Council and --\n 9 THE COURT:  Don't go in circles.  Give me the cite\n10 that says that these people can go to the City Council.\n11 MR. ALLEY:  Your Honor, it's the Florida home rule\n12 powers doctrine.\n13 THE COURT:  I want you to give me a citation.  I\n14 don't mean today.  Or at least I don't mean right now.  I\n15 want you to tell me what cite these lawyers can go to that\n16 will say when my clients are unhappy with the lack of a\n17 waiver, the appellate process is to go to City Council.  And\n18 I'd be amazed if that's in the home rule statute.\n19 MR. ALLEY:  No, it's not, in the home rule\n20 statute, expressly stated that way.\n21 THE COURT:  Tell me where it is expressly stated.\n22 If it's not expressly stated, you don't have it.  You can't\n23 just say, oh, you can always go to the City Council.  How is\n24 a litigant to know that?  I want you to -- you can file it\n25 as a submission.  Just give me a cite to the ordinance and\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 51   Filed 11/28/11   Page 67 of 68 PageID 495\nARGUMENT BY MR.

That's what I'm looking\n 4 for.\n 5 All right.  What's next?\n 6 MR. ALLEY:  Your Honor, I briefly touched on\n 7 severability, and the four-part test, and the intention of\n 8 City Council that the city would argue that these challenge\n 9 provisions, should the Court find them unconstitutional are\n10 severable, that there are severable provisions should the\n11 Court find that unconstitutional.\n12 And the city would like to preserve two minutes.\n13 Thank you.\n14 THE COURT:  You may do so.\n15 Ms. Keesler?\n16 MS. KEESLER:  Your Honor, thank you for affording\n17 me the time, but the Plaintiffs will rest on their papers\n18 and prior oral argument.\n19 THE COURT:  All right.\n20 Do you want another two minutes?\n21 MR. ALLEY:  No, thank you, Your Honor.\n22 THE COURT:  All right.  Let me just go through my\n23 notes, here, before I let you go.\n24 All right.

This action seeks declaratory relief, injunctive relief and compensatory damages pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. §1983, for ongoing and threatened injury to the First Amendment rights of individuals and\nan unincorporated association engaged in lawful expressive activity within the City of Fort Myers, \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 2 of 27 PageID 373\nFlorida.  This Court accordingly has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331\nas claims arising under the U.S. Constitution, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (a), as a civil action\nto redress the deprivation of civil rights and privileges secured by the U.S. Constitution.   \n2.  Venue is proper in the Middle District of Florida - Fort Myers Division, under 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)\n(1), insofar as defendant City of Fort Myers is located in Lee County, Florida, and is thereby wholly\nlocated within the above-referenced judicial district.\nINTRODUCTION\n3.  The set of Plaintiffs is comprised of thirteen (13) persons who are active in Southwest Florida in\nbringing awareness of social and economic justice issues through demonstrations, marches, and\nrallies, and related expressive speech and conduct, and one (1) unincorporated association whose\nmembers are concerned about current political, social and economic issues, including those arising\nlocally, nationally and globally.  In the instant civil action, the Plaintiffs challenge several provisions\nof the City of Fort Myers’ Municipal Code (“Fort Myers Code” or “Code”).  The City of Fort\nMyers  (hereinafter also “Fort Myers” or “defendant City”) employs a permit scheme, for expressive\nactivity in traditional public fora, that is violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments as an\nunlawful  prior  restraint,  because  it  is  content-based,  overbroad,  lacks  sufficient  procedural\nsafeguards, and it suffers from additional infirmities.  The permit scheme lacks sufficient standards\nin multiple instances, for example: to guide the decision of whether and under what conditions a\npermit will issue; to ensure that public officials must decide whether to issue or deny a permit in\nsufficient time to actually stage the event; fails to make exceptions for small-group political events\nor for spontaneous speech; or to delineate with clarity what conditions may be imposed on\nexpressive activities.   The absence of adequate standards in key areas means that the ordinance vests\npublic officials with unbridled discretion and invites content-based decisions based on the nature of\nthe speaker.  These are  forbidden grounds on which to base a permit scheme that requires a license\nto engage in protected speech; the permit scheme violates Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights by\nPage 2 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 3 of 27 PageID 374\nimpermissibly limiting their rights to speech, association, and assembly.  Furthermore, the Fort\nMyers allows City officials to accommodate “athletic sporting events, or cultural or civic events”\nafter public park closing hours, but allows no provision for accommodation of those who are\nparticipating in First Amendment-protected activity. Thus, the permit scheme in general, and the\nParks ordinance in particular, are content-based on their face and illustrate the governmental policy\nof preference for non-political speech. For these reasons, defendant City of Fort Myers must be\nenjoined from prohibiting the lawful exercise of First Amendment-protected activity.   Further, the\nPlaintiffs seek a declaration that the City’s “Special Events Permitting Scheme,” “Park Operating\nPolicy,” and “Parade and Processions Ordinance” are facially invalid as violative of protected\nexpressive conduct, and seeks damages for the wrongful abrogation of protected free speech,\nassociation and assembly. \nPARTIES\nPlaintiffs\n4.  Plaintiff OCCUPY FORT MYERS (“alternately “OFM”) is an unincorporated association of\nindividuals, mostly from Lee County, Florida and surrounding areas, who are concerned about  social\ninjustice in our country and who have gathered spontaneously to generate awareness of the\ncorrupting influence of massive amounts of money in the nation’s political process. [Valo Decl.\n[D.E. 1-1], at ¶ 3].   A core purpose of OFM is to bring awareness to the concerns about the U.S.\npolitical process and economic policy through symbolic, around-the-clock, peaceful protests referred\nto as “occupations.”  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶ 3].  OFM held their first rally and march on\nOctober 15, and began occupying Centennial Park in Fort Myers that evening.  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-\n1] at ¶ 5].\n5.

The City of Fort Myers is the legal entity responsible for the actions of its final\npolicymaker for city policies, the Fort Myers City Council.  As such, defendant City is responsible\nfor the passage of City Code Sec. 118.3.5(E)(1) which authorizes the use of the Special Events\nHandbook for all events on public land, including the Occupy Fort Myers demonstration, Sec. 2-273,\nSec. 58-154(6), Sec. 58-156(a), Sec. 58-157, and Chapter 86 by the City Council, and for the\nimplementation of such city laws.\nPage 6 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 7 of 27 PageID 378\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS\n19.  Plaintiffs seek to exercise their First Amendment rights to assemble and demonstrate in\nCentennial Park, and on other public property located in Fort Myers, Florida, to bring visibility to\nthe insidious influence of money on the U.S. political process, and to inform members of the general\npublic on political issues such as social justice and economic equality.  \nInteraction Between Event Organizers and City of Fort Myers Officials\n 20.  On or about October 11, 2011, Mark Hetrick, who volunteered his services as a member of the\nOFM Legal Working Team, called the Fort Myers Police Department (“FMPD”) to inquire about\nobtaining a permit for a planned OFM rally and march in downtown Fort Myers on Oct. 15, 2011.\n[Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶6].\n21.  FMPD indicated that OFM could rally and march downtown on Oct. 15th, provided that OFM\nsubmit to certain restrictions. Specifically, OFM could not: use a megaphone, march in the street,\nor include “vulgar language” on signs.   [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶6].  \n22.  Mr. Hetrick further inquired about OFM’s intentions to symbolically “occupy” Centennial Park\nbeginning on the evening of Oct. 15, 2011.  An FMPD contact said that the police would not\ninterfere with any overnight “occupation,” including allowing the erection of tents, as long as there\nwas no alcohol brought into the park. The FMPD advised OFM to contact the City of Fort Myers\nRecreation Division to obtain a permit for the overnight occupation.  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶6].\n23.  On October 15, 2011, OFM held a noon rally at Centennial Park, and then conducted an\napproximately one mile-long sidewalk procession from Centennial Park to the Bank of America\nbranch on First Street, and then back to Centennial Park. Approximately 500 people showed up to\nsupport the Occupy Fort Myers movement. The march and rally remained peaceful and respectful. \n[Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶6].\nPage 7 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 8 of 27 PageID 379\n24.   OFM began “occupying” Centennial Park on the evening of October 15th. The General\nAssembly of OFM, comprised of the entire gathering of persons engaged in a group decision-making\nprocess, agreed that the “occupiers” would respect the City and park by making sure that the\nparticipants  maintained quiet after park closing hours, and by thoroughly cleaning up after\nthemselves. The occupiers had no confrontations with members of the public, the City or FMPD\nfrom Oct. 15th through Oct. 20th.  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶9]. The “occupiers” did continue their\npolitical activity by engaging in awareness-building with an information booth for questions for the\ngeneral public set up at the entranceway of the gathering, print and television media, by displaying\npolitical signs, and through the symbolic presence of tents. [Faulkner Decl. [D.E. 1-2], at ¶ 3; see\nalso digital photographs of the OFM encampment area [D.E. 1-5]]. \n25.  On October 18, 2011, OFM obtained a “Special Events” pamphlet from the City, enclosed\nwithin it was a permitting scheme and a permit application. The “Special Events” pamphlet states\nthat “[t]he Special Events Advisory Board may have final approval of all events as detailed in City\nOrdiance #3019.” [See Special Events Pamphlet, [D.E. 30-1]]. OFM completed a permit application,\nand submitted it to the Recreation Division. OFM informed the Recreation Division, along with\nOfficer Sanchez of the FMPD, through email communication that Occupy Fort Myers sought to\ncooperate with the City.  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶10].\n26.    On October 19, 2011, at 10:19 a.m., Kelly MacDonald, Senior Program Coordinator in the\nRecreation Division informed OFM, through email, that, before the Special Event Committee could\neven review the permit application, OFM would need to obtain a $1 million liability insurance policy\nand bring the Liability Insurance certificate to the Recreation Administrative Office. Ms. MacDonald\ninformed OFM that the City was prepared to enforce Ordinance Sec. 58-153(3) if OFM did not\ncomply with the liability insurance by 3:00 p.m. on the same day.  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶10].\n27.    On October 19, 2011, Mark Hetrick contacted Ms. MacDonald by email and phone to let her\nknow that OFM could not possibly comply with the 3:00 p.m. deadline to obtain an insurance policy.\nThe City gave OFM the names of three insurance companies, and Ms. MacDonald agreed to allow\nPage 8 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 9 of 27 PageID 380\nOFM an additional day to attempt to obtain insurance and thereby comply with City regulations. \n[Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶10].\n28.   On Oct. 19, 2011, OFM informed the City of Fort Myers Recreation Division and Police\nDepartment, through email, that the insurance companies designated by the City of Fort Myers would\nnot provide the requested liability insurance policy to OFM. OFM informed Ms. MacDonald, Mr.\nSaeed Kazemi, the Public Works Director, and Officer Sanchez of the FMPD, through email, that\nOFM sought understanding and cooperation with the City, that the group would like to obtain a\npermit, but OFM could not satisfy the City’s requirements. OFM asked that the City not attempt to\ndismantle the OFM presence in Centennial Park.  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶11].\n29.   Even if an insurer would agree to insure OFM, OFM has absolutely no funds with which to pay\nfor a liability insurance policy, and it was conveyed by City personnel that the City of Fort Myers\nwould require OFM to apply for another permit and obtain a re-issuance or new insurance policy\nevery ten days.   [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶14].  OFM sought to review the procedures for\nrequesting a waiver of the liability insurance requirement or for appeal of the denial of a permit, but\nthere were no provisions for either waiver or for appeal, located in either the City of Fort Myers\nordinances or the Special Events pamphlet.  [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶12].  \n30.  On October 20, 2011, members of OFM and their legal counsel spent most of the day attempting\nto negotiate, in good faith, with City employees in an attempt to obtain a permit for the ongoing\nsymbolic demonstration. The City would not issue OFM a permit, nor would the City identify any\nprocedure for requesting either a waiver or an appeal of the City’s decision. [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1],\nat ¶15]. \n31.  On the evening of October 20, at approximately 10:45 p.m., members of the FMPD showed up\nat Centennial Park, and issued citations of $135 each to any individual who was planning on\nremaining in the park after 10:30 p.m. [Valo Decl. [D.E. 1-1], at ¶15; Faulkner Decl. [D.E. 1-2], at\n¶6; Ospina Decl. [D.E. 1-4], at ¶6].\nPage 9 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 10 of 27 PageID 381\n32.  On the morning of October 22, 2011, FMPD law enforcement officers arrived at OFM\nencampment area at approximately 6:15 a.m. and demanded the OFM occupiers to leave the park\nand remove their tents. [McDowell Decl. [D.E. 1-3], at ¶6]. \n33.  Humana, the insurance corporation, was sponsoring an Alzheimer’s Awareness event in\nCentennial Park on Saturday, October 22. FMPD Captain Viola informed OFM occupiers that\nHumana rented “the entire park,” and that he didn’t wish for OFM members to leave the park\ncompletely until noon. When Capt. Viola was further questioned by OFM members, he informed\nOFM that the Humana representatives did not want the tents in the park during their event. The\noccupiers who were present each received a citation in the amount of $135 for being in the park after\nclosing hours, even though Humana representatives were also in the park before 6:00 a.m. The\noccupiers who were present each received a citation in the amount of $135 for being in the park after\nclosing hours, even though Humana representatives were also in the park before 6:00 a.m. \n[McDowell Decl. [D.E. 1-3], at ¶6].   \n34.  On November 2, 2011, the City of Fort Myers agreed to extend a Special Events permit to\nOccupy Fort Myers for a period of 10 days, with an option to renew, if Occupy Fort Myers agreed\nto voluntarily vacate Centennial Park for the weekend’s Taste of the Town event. [See Declaration\nof Christopher Faulkner, dated November 18, 2001, hereinafter “Faulkner Decl. 11/18,” attached \nhereto as “Exhibit 1,” at ¶ 4.]\n35.  On November 7, 2011, the City of Fort Myers issued Occupy Fort Myers a 10-day permit.\n[Faulkner Decl. 11/18, at ¶ 5; Exhibit B, attached to Faulkner Decl. 11/18]. The agreed upon permit\nprovisions stated that the City could refuse or rescind the permit if the event was hazardous or if\nthere was an emergency situation in the City of Fort Myers. The agreed upon permit provisions\nfurther stated that “[f]ailure to meet the requirements of this agreement may result in future rental\n(sic) requests being denied.”\nPage 10 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 11 of 27 PageID 382\n36. On November 15, 2011, this Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the City from\nenforcing certain provisions of their Parades and Processions Ordinance and their Park Regulations\nOrdinance. [D.E. 48].\n37.  On November 17, 2011, members of Occupy Fort Myers went to the City of Fort Myers\nRecreation Division to obtain a re-issuance of their permit. Kelly MacDonald, the City of Fort Myers\nSr. Program Coordinator, told OFM that she was instructed to state that the permit request was\ndenied.1  She refused to disclose why the permit request was being denied, and was unable to inform\nOFM how to appeal the denial other than to say that OFM should “contact the Legal Department.”\n38. On November 17, 2011, at approximately 11:00 p.m., law enforcement officers in the Fort Myers\nPolice Department went to Centennial Park and demanded that all members of OFM leave the park\nimmediately or face arrest. One member of OFM was arrested for trespass. \n39.   As a direct and proximate cause of the unconstitutional City ordinances, Plaintiffs have suffered\ndamages, which include violation of their civil rights, limitation of their core political message to\nthose who may be interested in participating in OFM events but whose speech has been chilled, and\neconomic damages, in the nature of the value of the lost publicity, the value of volunteer staff time\nto adjust events and notify persons as to governmental harassment, the cost of transportation and\nrelated costs to attempt to comply with City demands, costs of litigation, and related expenses.\nCity of Fort Myers Policies2\nThe Special Events Permitting Scheme\n40.  The Temporary Land Uses Code, Sec. 118.3.5(E)(1), entitled “Temporary Uses and Structures,” \ncomprises a portion of the City’s standardless and ad hoc permitting scheme, as follows:\n1\n In Ms. MacDonald’s affidavit, filed with the Court on November 4, 2011 [D.E. 36-1], at ¶ 4, Ms.\nMacDonald stated under oath that “never in my tenure has an application been denied.”\n2 Copies of the Challenged City Code sections are attached hereto as Exhibit 2.\nPage 11 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 12 of 27 PageID 383\nThe term ‘special events’ shall mean an event held on public land . . .

The Special Events Advisory Board Ordinance 3019, Codified as Sec. 2-273, entitled “Powers\nand Duties,” is a sweeping set of provisions vesting specific powers within the Special Advisory\nBoard, as follows: \nThe special events advisory board shall:\n(1) Act in an advisory capacity to the city council in matters relating to special events\nproposed by event managers, which are (a) Open to the public; (b) held within the city\nlimits in spaces that are overseen by the city;(c) Expected to attract more than 1,000\npeople; and (d) Requesting the city council approve a waiver or a reduction of fees\nor a cash sponsorship.\n. . . \n(3) Recommend to the city council special events that should receive city sponsorship\nby a reduction or waiver in the fees charged for the use of public property and/or the\ncost of services to be provided by the city, based on a weighted scale of merit;\n(4) Recommend regulations for the conduct of special events that will increase interest\ntherein to the citizens, residents and visitors of the city generally . . . .\n3\n See D.E. 30-1.\n4\n For the codification information of Ordinance No. 3019, see ¶ 42, infra.\nPage 12 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 13 of 27 PageID 384\n43.  All provisions of the special events permitting scheme are silent as to the standards for approval\nor denial of a permit, the standard for the imposition of any fees, or the process to appeal the denial\nof a permit or appeal any permit provision. \nPark Operating Policies\n44. Sec. 58-154(6)5, entitled “Prohibited Behavior,” imposes impermissibly vague restrictions on\nsymbolic speech and expressive activity, as follows:\nNo unauthorized person in the park shall do any of the following: . . .  Loitering and\nboisterousness. Sleep or protractedly lounge on the seats, benches, or other areas, or\nengage in loud, boisterous, threatening, abusive, insulting or indecent language, or\nengage in any disorderly conduct or behavior tending to a breach of the public peace.\n45 . Sec. 58-156(a)6, entitled “Park Operating Policy,” is a content-based restriction on symbolic\nspeech and expressive activity, as follows:\nHours. . . Normal park hours are 6:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. unless posted otherwise by the recreation\nmanager.  Such  hours  shall  be  deemed  extended  by  the  recreation  manager  as  necessary  to\naccommodate athletic sport events, or cultural or civic activities.\n5\n Enacted in City Code of 1963, Sec. 24-28(5); City Code of 1991, Sec. 12-217.\n6\n Enacted in City Code of 1963, Sec. 24-28(7); City Code of 1991, Sec. 12-219.\nPage 13 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 14 of 27 PageID 385\n46.  Sec. 118.3.6(C) defines “Civic Use Categories.” The extensive list of civic use categories,7 which\ngoes on for pages, does not include political rallies or demonstrations. The Park and Open spaces\ncategory does not include political expression as a principal use or as an accessory use. \n47.  Sec. 58-1578, entitled “Violations; Penalties” states, as follows:\nA violation of this division will subject the violator to a find of not less than $25.00\nand not more than $250.00. Such violators may be issued appropriate citations by\ncity policy officers.\n48.  There is no authority for arrest in the penalties section of the Park Regulations Code.\nParades and Processions Policy\n49. Chapter 86, entitled “Parades and Processions,” is a content-based law that has three\nsubsections that outline a permitting scheme without specific factors or guidelines and vests\nunbridled discretion in the Chief of Police, as follows:\n86-153 (a) No parade or procession upon any street of the city, and no open-air\npublic meeting upon any public property shall be permitted unless a special permit\n7\n 1. Community service. Uses of a public, nonprofit, or charitable nature providing ongoing public safety,\neducational, training, or counseling to the general public on a regular basis, without a residential component. \n2.  Day care. Uses providing care, protection, and supervision of children or adults on a regular basis away from their\nprimary residence. Care is typically provided to a given individual for fewer than 18 hours each day, although the facility\nmay be open 24 hours each day. \n3.  Educational facility. Public and private (including charter or religious) schools at the primary, elementary,\nmiddle, junior high, or high school level that provide basic academic education. Also includes colleges and other\ninstitutions of higher learning that offer courses of general or specialized study leading to a degree usually in a campus\nsetting. \n4. Medical facility. Uses providing medical or surgical care to patients. Some uses may offer overnight care. \n5. Park and open space. Uses focusing on natural areas consisting mostly of vegetation, passive or active outdoor\nrecreation areas, or community gardens, and having few structures. \n6.  Passenger terminal. Public or commercial facilities for the takeoff and landing of airplanes and helicopters, and\nterminals for taxi, rail or bus service. \n7.  Place of worship. Places of assembly that provide meeting areas for religious practice. \n8.  Social service. Uses that primarily provide treatment of those with psychiatric, alcohol, or drug problems, and\ntransient housing related to social service programs. \n9.  Utilities. Public or private infrastructure serving a limited area with no on-site personnel (Minor Utility) or the\ngeneral community and possibly having on-site personnel (Major Utility). \n8\n Enacted in City Code of 1963, Sec. 24-28(8); City Code of 1991, Sec. 12-213.\nPage 14 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 15 of 27 PageID 386\nshall first be obtained. Any person desiring a permit under this section shall make\nwritten application to the chief of police or some duly authorized member of the\npolice department. Permits issued under this section shall be printed or written, duly\nsigned by the chief of police or some duly authorized member of the police\ndepartment after approval, and shall specify the day, hour, place and purpose of\nsuch parade, procession or open-air public meeting. (b) The fee for such permit\nshall be $5.00 if the activity permitted requires no extra policing or will cause no\nextra cost or expense to the city. If such activity will require additional policing or\nsupervision, or otherwise incur additional cost and expense to the city, there shall be\ncharged such fee as will defray such additional cost to be determined by the chief of\npolice. \n86-154 “If the chief of police knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that to\npermit any parade, procession or open-air meeting under this article may or will\nresult in violence, fighting, disturbance of the peace, or injuries to persons or\ndamage to property, he may refuse to approve issuance of a permit hereunder by\nendorsing on the application or indicating in writing to the city clerk his reason for\nhis refusal and such permit shall not be issued.\n \nApplication of City Code to OFM Events\n50.  The City of Fort Myers required OFM to obtain a “special events” permit as required in City\nCode Sec. 118.3.5(E)(1)  for their expressive conduct of “occupying” Fort Myers, even though\nOFM’s demonstration does not fall within the definitional parameters of a “special event.” \nBecause the City has no provision in their ordinance scheme for First Amendment activity, the City \narbitrarily subjected OFM to the standardless and content-based permitting requirements identified\nin the Special Events Handbook. Furthermore, since OFM was subjected to special events\nprovisions, which are reviewed by the Special Events Advisory Board, City Code Sec. 2-273\nallows the Board complete control, without defined appellate procedures, as to whether or not to\nentertain the waiver of any provisions.\n51.  The City of Fort Myers has issued citations to members of OFM, and has begun arresting\nmembers of OFM, for violations of City Code 58-156(a). This section of the City Code is clearly\ncontent-based viewpoint discrimination as it shows a policy of preference for non-political speech.\nThe Recreation Manager also has unbridled discretion to extend park hours for sporting, cultural or\nPage 15 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 16 of 27 PageID 387\ncivic events, but not for First Amendment-protected activity. OFM is subject to the provisions of\nSec. 58-154(6). This code is impermissibly vague since OFM would not be aware of what\nconstitutes “boisterousness” or “behavior tending to the breach of the peace” or “protracted\nlounging.”  Further, at a political rally in Centennial Park on Saturday, November 19, 2011, a\nspeaker cautioned an activist not to utilize “f-- k” or other 4-letter words that might be deemed\ninsulting or indecent. Citizens are engaging in “self-censorship” to avoid violating Fort Myers\nvague and unconstitutionally overbroad “Park Speech Code.”\n52. The FMPD allowed OFM to rally and march on a sidewalk, pursuant to City Code 86-153,\nprovided OFM agree to certain ad hoc restrictions. These restrictions reflect city policies vesting\nunbridled discretion in the Fort Myers Police Department and comprise an impermissible and\nethereal permitting scheme. Because any “open air meeting” is subject to the provisions of this\ncode, OFM members are divested of First Amendment rights and an important liberty interest.\nCAUSES OF ACTION\n53.   As to each cause of action delineated below in Counts One through Six, the plaintiffs advance\ntheir federal constitutional claims against the City of Fort Myers in the City’s capacity as a state\nactor, through the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCOUNT ONE\nMonell Claim - Official Policy to Suppress Protected Speech and Assembly\n(42 U.S.C. § 1983 - Violation of First Amendment - Viewpoint Discrimination)\nCity of Fort Myers’ Permitting Scheme (Fort Myers City Code, Sec. 2-273, and the Special\nEvents Handbook as ratified by Sec. 118.3.5(E)(1)\nBy ALL PLAINTIFFS Against CITY OF FORT MYERS\n54.

At all times relevant hereto, the City Council of defendant City of Fort Myers (“Council”) was\nthe final policymaker for the City of Fort Myers, for the purpose of adopting ordinances and other\npolicies regulating constitutionally-protected speech, expressive conduct, and assembly within the\nboundaries of the City.\n56.  The Council enacted Ordinance No. 3422 §6 on January 14, 2008, codified as Code Sec.\n118.3.5(E)(1). This Ordinance ratifies the use of the “Special Events Handbook” as City policy for\nthe application of all permits on public land within the City of Fort Myers. The Special Events\nHandbook is unconstitutional on its face as an impermissible prior restraint, containing terms\nwhich provide for targeted regulation of core political speech while allowing unbridled discretion\nin City officials to approve or deny permits, or to create permit provisions and set fees and\nrequirements without identifiable standards. Neither the Special Events section of the Code, Sec.\n118.3.5(E)(1), nor the Special Events Handbook have any provision to appeal decisions made by\nCity officials in their permitting decisions.\n57.  The Council enacted Ordinance No. 3019, on September 17, 2001, codified as Code Sec. 2-\n271 to Sec. 2-273 referenced as the “Special Events Advisory Board” Ordinance, precluding\nOFM’s demonstration event without first obtaining a permit, to be reviewed and recommended by\nthe Special Advisory Board members, defined in Sec. 2-271 and 2-272. \n58.  The Special Events Permitting Scheme is unconstitutional on its face as an impermissible prior\nrestraint, containing terms which provide for targeted regulation of core political speech while\nallowing unbridled discretion in the Board to provide for the exemption of permit requirements for\nfavored speech, including commercial speech.\n59. As part of a content-based regulatory scheme, the Special Event Handbook is subject to strict\nscrutiny, mandating that the defendant City establish that its regulatory scheme is: (1) narrowly-\ntailored; and (2) serving a compelling state interest.  The broad prohibitions against politically-\ncentered speech and conduct, the application of the permit schemes to small groups such as OFM,\nthe preference for commercial speech, the failure to provide for spontaneous speech events, the\nPage 17 of  27\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00608-JES-DNF   Document 49    Filed 11/21/11   Page 18 of 27 PageID 389\nfailure to have fee exemptions for indigent applicants, the lack of an appeals process, and other\nfactors preclude a finding that the ordinance scheme is narrowly-tailored.   The content-based\npermitting scheme does not serve any compelling state interest.\n60.   The use of the Special Events Permitting Scheme by Defendant has chilled the First\nAmendment-protected activities of the plaintiffs; has caused and will continue to cause the citation\nof members of the plaintiffs, and has and will continue to cause the arrest of members of OFM, as\nwell as others similarly situated, who wish to exercise their rights of free speech, assembly and\nassociation. \n61.   The adoption by the Fort Myers City Council of the Special Events Permitting Scheme as City\npolicy, and the present and future implementation of this permitting scheme, constitute the\nproximate causation of the deprivation of the First Amendment rights of the Plaintiffs and\nsimilarly-situated persons for the ongoing events in Centennial Park, and other imminently-\nscheduled events elsewhere within the City of Fort Myers.

As a content-based prohibition, Code 58-156(a) is subject to strict scrutiny, mandating that the\ndefendant City establish that it be (1) narrowly-tailored, and (2) serving a compelling state\ninterest.  The broad prohibitions against politically-centered speech and conduct, while allowing\nfor the accommodation for preferred non-political speech, preclude a finding that the ordinance\nscheme is narrowly-tailored.
