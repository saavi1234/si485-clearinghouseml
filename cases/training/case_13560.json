    "summary": "<p>On December 7, 2011, a political activist and supporter of Occupy Minnesota filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota under § 1983 against the County of Hennepin. The plaintiff, represented by a public interest law firm, asked the court for injunctive relief revoking the notice of trespassing and permitting the plaintiff to enter government property without interference, and for compensatory and punitive damages, claiming that the defendants had arrested her without probable cause on account of her political activism. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that she was a legal observer for an Occupy Minnesota protest standing on a public sidewalk outside a government building when the defendants arrested her for trespassing. </p><p>Two days prior to the incident in dispute, security for the Hennepin County government building served a \"trespass notice\" upon the defendant resulting from writing political slogans in chalk on government property. The notice barred the plaintiff from Hennepin County government property for 365 days, or until the notice was resolved on appeal to the security manager. Two days later, while the plaintiff was serving as a legal observer for the National Lawyers Guild, Hennepin County security guards approached her and told her that she could not enter the property because of her prior trespass notice. She claimed that at that moment, two deputy sheriffs arrived and placed her under arrest for trespassing. She spent seven hours in county jail before she was released on bail. She was charged with trespass, but the prosecution dropped the charge at the plaintiff's second court appearance.</p><p>On January 18, 2012, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her case, because she had reached a settlement with the defendants. According to news reports, the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiff $15,000 and revoked her ban from government property. In return, the plaintiff agreed not to chalk or otherwise deface government property. Additionally, the defendants agreed to change their policy for appeals from bans from county government property. Now, if the county wants someone barred from the property for longer than 45 days, that person can appeal and must get a hearing within 10 days. If the hearing official agrees with the trespass order, she must issue a written decision justifying her action.</p><p></p>",

All individual defendants named above are being sued in both their\npersonal and official capacities.  At all times relevant hereto, all individual defendants\nwere acting under color of state law.\nIII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n14. Plaintiff Melissa Lynn Hill is a political activist and legal worker. \nHer activities have included initiating a satirical political campaign against Defendant\n3\n\nCASE 0:11-cv-03542-ADM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 12/07/11   Page 4 of 13\nSheriff Richard Stanek called “Kitten for Sheriff.”  She frequently attends court hearings\nat the Hennepin County Government Center.  Plaintiff Hill had frequently attended the\n“Occupy Minnesota Protest” during early October, 2011 because of her support of its\npositions.  She has at times made political statements by drawing them on public property\nwith chalk that can be easily washed off. \n15. The Hennepin County Government Center is a large public building\nthat occupies two full city blocks in downtown Minneapolis which contains numerous\npublic courtrooms, court offices, county administrative offices, and many public services\nprovided by the state and county.  There is a large public atrium on the second floor\nwhich can serve as a public gathering place.  There are also large open public plazas on\nthe north and south sides of the building.  The public plazas also frequently serve as\npublic gathering places.  At the time of the incidents described in this Complaint, as well\nas at present, there is a continuous political protest taking place on the Government\nCenter’s plazas called “Occupy Minnesota.”  This protest is part of a national movement\nobjecting to the extreme unequal concentration of wealth in the United States, and the\ncorrupt domination of wealth and power by a small group of persons and corporations.\n16. On October 13, 2011, Plaintiff was at the Government Center Plaza\nin support of the Occupy Minnesota action.  During this time, Hennepin County\nGovernment Center security guards, including Defendant Busch, handed Plaintiff a\n“Trespass Notice.” The trespass notice banned Plaintiff from the Hennepin County\n4\n\nCASE 0:11-cv-03542-ADM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 12/07/11   Page 5 of 13\nGovernment Center, including “building, parking lot, grounds or other property” for 365\ndays.  The notice stated that if Ms. Hill returned to the property, she would be arrested\nand charged with a crime. There was no explanation of any sort on the trespass notice as\nto why Plaintiff was being banned from the government center area.  The security staff\ndid not provide any sort of hearing or due process before banning Plaintiff from this\nentire public area.  The only remedy provided was a notation on the bottom of the trespass\nnotice that she could contest the notice by writing to the security manager.\n17. On October 15, 2011, at around 5 pm, Plaintiff was standing on the\npublic sidewalk to the south of the Hennepin County Government Center plaza. The\nsidewalk was adjacent to the street.  Plaintiff was present to observe a demonstration\ntaking place in connection with Occupy Minnesota.  She was serving as a “Legal\nObserver” for the National Lawyers Guild, a role which consists of observing protests in\norder to witness and document any violations of the rights of political demonstrators. \nPlaintiff was wearing a green cap that stated, “NLG Legal Observer” on the front.\n18. While Plaintiff was observing the OccupyMN protest from the\nsidewalk, Hennepin County Government Center security guards approached Ms. Hill and\ntold her she had been trespassed from the property and could not enter the grounds.  Ms.\nHill pointed out that she was not on the Government Center Property and had a right to be\non the sidewalk.  The security guard agreed with Plaintiff that she was not trespassing on\nthe Government Center property at that time.  \n5\n\nCASE 0:11-cv-03542-ADM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 12/07/11   Page 6 of 13\n19. During Plaintiff’s discussion with the security guard where he agreed\nshe was not trespassing, Defendant Deputy C.C. Sedesky suddenly approached Plaintiff\nand told her she was under arrest.  Defendant Sedesky and Defendant Deputy J. Steffens\nthen escorted Plaintiff into a tunnel underneath the Government Center, placed her in\nhandcuffs and booked her into jail.  Plaintiff had to spend approximately seven hours in\nthe Hennepin County Jail before jail staff released her on bail.  She was charged with the\ncrime of trespass in violation of state law.\n20. Defendant Sheriff Richard Stanek was observing Plaintiff standing\non the Government Center sidewalk from his vehicle on October 15, 2011 before and\nduring her arrest.  Upon information and belief, it was Stanek who ordered that Plaintiff\nbe arrested.\n21. Plaintiff was forced to obtain counsel and appear in court to defend\nherself against the false charge of trespass.  At the second court appearance, the\nprosecutor dismissed the charge.\n22. Defendants lacked any probable cause or arguable probable cause to\nbelieve Plaintiff had committed any crime.\n23. On November 18, 2011, Plaintiff, through her counsel, contested her\ntrespass notice in the manner provided on the trespass notice, by sending a letter\naddressed to the security manager.  The letter stated that there was no legitimate basis to\nbar Plaintiff from the public property in question, that the notice was impermissibly vague\n6\n\nCASE 0:11-cv-03542-ADM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 12/07/11   Page 7 of 13\nby failing to state any basis for barring Plaintiff from the property, and that the action of\nbanning from her property violated her constitutional rights to free speech and due\nprocess.\n24. Defendant security manager Kirk Simmons responded to Plaintiff’s\nletter contesting the trespass notice in a memorandum dated November 23, 2011,\nupholding the November 23, 2011 trespass notice as well as a prior trespass notice\nallegedly issued on April 21, 2011.  This summary decision did not provide any\nopportunity for Ms. Hill to be heard, and provided no opportunity for further\nadministrative remedies or appeal.  \n25. The alleged April 21, 2011 trespass notice, which was actually\nissued on April 12, 2011, also failed to provide any explanation or authority for banning\nPlaintiff from the Government Center, and did not provide any sort of appeal remedy.  It\nlisted the address of the Government Center but did not indicate whether it applied to the\nbuilding or surrounding property, both or neither.\n26. As a result of Defendants’ above-described actions, Plaintiff has\nsuffered and continues to suffer harm and damage, including but not limited to denial of\nher individual and constitutionally guaranteed liberties, mental distress, embarrassment\nand humiliation, harm to her reputation, loss of liberty, and other damages in an amount\nto be determined.\n7\n\nCASE 0:11-cv-03542-ADM-JJG   Document 1   Filed 12/07/11   Page 8 of 13\nIV.
