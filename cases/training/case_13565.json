The law clerk has stated that she worked on the above-captioned case at that time. The Court has made no further inquiry of the law clerk and does not know the nature of her work on the case. While in Chambers, the law clerk has not discussed the case with the undersigned and indeed has had no involvement in the case. She will have no involvement in the future. Staff in my chambers have been instructed not to communicate with the law clerk in any manner about the case. In addition, the law clerk has been instructed not to communicate with anyone in Chambers about the case. The Court believes that it will be completely impartial in this case. If, however, any party wishes to make any application with respect to this matter, the party should do so on or before November 15, 2018. SO ORDERED., ( Motions due by 11/15/2018.)

USCA Case Number 16-3146.Members of Occupy Wall Street (\"OWS protesters\" or \"protesters\") assert that a group of New York City Police Officers (the \"Officers\") unlawfully detained them during a protest outside the Sheraton Hotel where President Obama was attending a fundraising dinner. The protesters claim that this detention violated their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Concluding that the Officers' motivation for the detention was a material fact in dispute and that a finding as to the Officers' motivation affected the determination of the objective reasonableness of the Officers actions, the district court denied the Officers summary judgment on the protesters' First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims, and denied the Officers qualified immunity. The Officers appealed. This court denied the protesters' motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Officers argue before us that the limited detention that occurred was permissible under the special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment so as not to violate the protesters constitutional rights and, in any event, they are entitled to qualified immunity. We identify disputes of fact that do not permit a court to conclude as a matter of law that the protesters' twohour detention was permissible under the special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. We nonetheless conclude that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court erred in concluding that the Officers' subjective intent in temporarily detaining the protesters was relevant to whether the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Considered objectively, we conclude that, at the time of the challenged actions, reasonable officers could have believed that the approximately twohour detention of the protesters in response to concerns for the President's security was justified in light of then established law. Because the Officers could have reasonably believed the temporary detention was lawful, they are also entitled to qualified immunity on the OWS protesters' First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment claims.

    "summary": "<p>On Apr. 30, 2012, five members of the Occupy Wall Street movement filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, against the City of New York and individual New York City Police Department officers. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought class certification, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that officers of the NYPD violated their rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as well as their rights under the Constitution of the State of New York. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that they were unlawfully detained by NYPD officers during an Occupy Wall Street demonstration held in New York City on Nov. 8, 2011. </p><p>The plaintiffs' claims arose from the NYPD's usage of barricades during the demonstration, when protesters gathered in Bryant Park. Their plan was to march toward a fundraising event attended by President Obama at the Sheraton Hotel and protest outside of the hotel. The plaintiffs alleged that they were illegally confined in a closed pen formed by police-erected barricades for nearly two hours. The plaintiffs alleged that they repeatedly asked to leave the enclosure, but the officers refused and threatened to arrest anyone who tried to leave, while tourists and journalists were permitted to leave the barricaded area. The plaintiffs were never arrested nor charged with any violation, misdemeanor, or crime.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that this conduct amounted to false arrest, and violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, association, and assembly, as well as their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants subjected them to selective enforcement in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Furthermore, the plaintiffs claimed that the other NYPD officers had an affirmative duty to assess the constitutionality of their actions, and that their failure to intervene amounted to a separate and distinct violation of plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</p><p>The plaintiffs argued that the NYPD's conduct violated a Stipulation of Settlement and Order in another Southern District of New York case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14002\"><i>Stauber v. City of New York</i></a>, 1:03-cv-9163. That settlement amended Section 213-11, 21(h)(3) of the New York Police Department Patrol Guide to state the following:</p><p><blockquote> Barrier configuration for demonstrations should not unreasonably restrict access to and participation in the event. For example, attendees should be permitted to leave a barricaded area at any time. In addition, if crowd conditions and other circumstances permit, participants should be permitted to leave and return to the same area. Sufficient openings in the barricades should be maintained for purpose of permitted attendees to leave expeditiously and return to the event as described in this paragraph.</blockquote></p><p>In their complaint, the plaintiffs asked the court to issue an order compelling the NYPD to comply with this section.</p><p>On Mar. 6, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for (1) failure to state a claim and (2) failure to fulfill conditions precedent to filing suit. The defendants argued that the barricades amounted to a reasonable time, place, manner restriction under the First Amendment, and that the need to ensure the President's security rendered the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim non-actionable. The defendants also pointed to New York General Municipal Law § 50-i(1), which sets forth certain procedures for suing the City. The defendants claimed that plaintiffs' had failed to comply with § 50-i(1), and that their claims were therefore barred.</p><p>On Nov. 21, 2013, District Judge Thomas P. Griesa for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. Judge Griesa acknowledged that although it was \"a close question as to whether [the complaint] states a valid cause of action for violation of constitutional rights . . . [t]he court believes that it is not appropriate at this stage to rule on the merits of the case.\" <i>Berg v. Kelly</i>, 12-cv-03391 TPG, 2013 WL 6153253, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2013). However, the court noted that \"a summary judgment motion, or cross-summary judgment motions, may be appropriate in order to avoid a drawn-out litigation with full discovery and trial.\" <i>Id.</i></p><p>On Dec. 18, 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On Jan. 21, 2016, the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.</p><p>On Aug. 10, 2016, the district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court denied the defendants' summary judgment motion with respect to the Fourth Amendment false-arrest claim, the First Amendment retaliation claim, the Fourteenth Amendment selective-enforcement claim, and the failure-to-intervene claim, finding that genuine issues of material fact existed. The court also found that the defendants had failed to show that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs' § 1983 claims against the Commissioner of the NYPD and the Chief of Department of the NYPD, finding that they failed for lack of sufficient involvement in the alleged constitutional violations, as neither defendant was at the scene was at the scene of the protest. The court also dismissed the state constitutional claims, because as the plaintiffs had alternate remedies available under a federal statute such as § 1983, their state constitutional tort claims were \"redundant and precluded\" under <i>Biswas v. City of New York</i>, 973 F. Supp. 2d 504, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).</p><p>On Sept. 9, 2016, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, from the district court's opinion dated Aug. 10, 2016. The case was assigned Docket No. 16-3146. On Nov. 18, 2016, several of the plaintiffs-appellees moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, but the Sixth Circuit denied the motion on Jan. 11, 2017. A Second Circuit panel of Judges Reena Raggi, Susan Carney, and Peter Hall ruled on the appeal on July 25, 2018 (897 F.3d 99). They noted that the officers did have a special need that could exempt them from the Fourth Amendment's probable cause requirement--the need to protect the President--but found that the ensuing detention procedure did not balance the competing interests of protecting the President, since the protesters were not allowed to leave at all while non-protesters successfully left the area in small groups without incident. However, they overturned the District Court's analysis that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity because there was a question of material fact as to the mental state of the officers erecting the barricades. They stated that qualified immunity is analyzed through the lens of a reasonable officer, not the mental state of the officer at issue, and found that a reasonable officer protecting the President could think that this detention strategy did not violate any Constitutional rights. With this grant of qualified immunity, all the Constitutional complaints were invalidated, and the Second Circuit recommended that the District Court dismiss the case with prejudice.</p><p>District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, assigned to the case since 2018, took up the Second Circuit's recommendation and declined to reargue the case on April 22, 2019. The decision to decline to reargue was based on a November 30, 2018 recommendation from Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein (343 F.Supp.3d 419). In the same order, he noted that all claims were now dismissed, and ordered the plaintiffs to pay attorney's fees. The case is closed.</p>",

Plaintiffs were protestors who were allegedly deprived of their \nfederal and state constitutional rights when New York Police Department \n(\"NYPD\")  officers detained them in a  barricaded area for  over an hour. \nDefendants,  NYPD  officers  at  the  time  of  the  protest,  now  move  for \nsummary judgment on all claims.  For the following reasons, defendants' \nmotion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part. \nBackground \nDrawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor,  a  reasonable \njury could find the following facts to be true.  See Tolan v.  Cotton,  134 S. \nCt.  1861, 1863 (2014). \nOn November 30, 2011, a  protest took place in Manhattan as part \nof the Occupy Wall  Street movement.  Scores of protestors gathered at \n- 1 -\n\nBryant Park in  the  early  evening.  Their  plan was  to  march  through \nMidtown toward a fundraising event attended by President Obama at the \nSheraton  Hotel,  located  at  Seventh  Avenue  between  52nd  and  53rd \nStreets.  Their  goal,  rhetorically,  was  to  \"#OccupyObama\"  and  have \n\"#DinnerWithBarrack\" by protesting outside the Sheraton.  See Rozental \nDep. 16:18-17:4. \nAs the protestors neared the President's event, they stopped briefly \none block south of the Sheraton, at the corner of Seventh Avenue and \n51st  Street.  The  NYPD  had  previously  designated  this  corner  as  a \n\"protest  area.\"  Some  protestors  briefly  discussed  remaining  in  the \nprotest area, but, ultimately, they continued northward on their march. \nBecause  police  officers  had  restricted  some  pedestrian  traffic \naround the Sheraton, the protestors could not walk up Seventh Avenue. \nInstead, a  group of between 50 and 200 protestors proceeded north on \nBroadway, turned right on 53rd Street, and finally came to the southwest \ncorner of Seventh Avenue  and  53rd  Street,  opposite  the  Sheraton.  In \nplans made prior to the presidential visit, the NYPD  had designated this \narea as  a  \"press  pen\"-that is,  an  area where  members  of the  media \ncould await the President's arrival at the Sheraton. \nBy the time the protesters got to the press pen at approximately \n8:00 p.m.,  police  barricades already flanked  the curb along 53rd  Street \nand at the  southwest corner of Seventh Avenue  and  53rd  Street.  The \neffect was  to  create a  U -shaped barricaded area that was enclosed on \n- 2 -\n\nthree sides.  Police  officers ushered the protestors into this barricaded \narea.  See  Hart Dep.  46:24-47:9,  47:25-48:12;  Latalardo  Dep.  41:23-\n42:2, 43:11-15. \nShortly before the President's 8:50p.m. arrival at the Sheraton, the \nNYPD established a \"frozen zone\" to restrict pedestrian traffic around the \nhotel.  The zone extended from Sixth Avenue to Broadway and from 52nd \nStreet to  53rd  Street.  It therefore  included  the  entire  press pen,  even \nthough that location \nSee  Purtell  Dep.  60: 17-63:4; \nAt some point, police officers placed additional barricades behind \nthe protesters on 53rd Street,  there by closing the press pen on all four \nsides.  See Berg Dep. 43:3-17.  Defendants have not been able to identify \nwho ordered this closure, and it is unclear whether it occurred before or \nafter the President's arrival.  The protestors repeatedly asked to leave the \npress  pen,  but  police  officers  repeated  refused  their  requests.  Some \npolice  officers  even  threatened  to  arrest protestors who  tried  to  leave. \nSee Jetter Dep. 41:8-11.  Police officers did, however, allow tourists and \njournalists to  leave  the press pen,  and traffic  flowed  freely on Seventh \nAvenue between the Sheraton and the press pen.  See,  e.g., Jetter Dep. \n38:18-39: 19;  Rozental  Dep.  42: 15-16;  Dkt.  110, Video  Ex.  12  at 0:40 \nand 4:10.  When protestors asked why they alone were being detained, \n- 3 -\n\npolice officers told them it was \"for being a  protestor.\"  Dkt.  110, Video \nEx. 13 at 4:30; see also Jetter Dep. 41:12-16. \nThe President left the Sheraton at  10:25 p.m., and police officers \nreleased the protesters from the press pen soon after.  The detention had \nlasted for over an hour. \nFollowing these events, plaintiffs, who were all part of the protest, \nfiled a complaint alleging claims under 42 U .S.C. §  1983 for violations of \nthe First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, \nas  well  as  parallel  claims  under  the  New  York  State  Constitution. \nPlaintiffs brought this case as a class action on behalf of themselves and \nall  other  persons who  were  detained  in  the  press  pen.  In  November \n2013,  the  court  denied  defendants'  motion  for  judgment  on  the \npleadings.  After plaintiffs amended their complaint,  defendants moved \nfor summary judgment on all claims. \nDiscussion \nSummary judgment is proper only \"if the movant shows there is no \ngenuine  dispute  as to  any material fact  and the  movant is  entitled to \njudgment as a  matter of law.\"  Fed. R.  Civ.  P.  56(a).  A fact is \"material\" \nwhen it \"might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\" \nAnderson v.  Liberty Lobby, Inc.,  477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  And an issue \nis \"genuine\"  when \"the  evidence  is  such  that a  reasonable jury could \nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Id. \n- 4 -\n\n\"Credibility  determinations,  the  weighing  of  evidence,  and  the \ndrawing of legitimate  inferences from  the facts  are jury functions,  not \nthose of a judge.\"  Id. at 255.  The court must \"believe[]\" the nonmovant's \nevidence and draw \"all justifiable inferences ... in his favor.\"  Id.  \"[I]f \nthere  is  any  evidence  in  the  record  from  any  source  from  which  a \nreasonable inference in the nonmoving party's favor may be drawn, the \nmoving  party  simply  cannot obtain  a  summary judgment.\"  Binder & \nBinder PC  v.  Barnhart,  481  F.3d  141,  148  (2d  Cir.  2007)  (citation and \nalteration omitted).  In sum, the court may grant such relief only \"if, on \nthe  basis of all  the  pleadings,  affidavits  and other papers on file,  and \nafter drawing all inferences and resolving all ambiguities in favor of the \nnon-movant,  it appears that the evidence  supporting the non-movant's \ncase  is  so  scant  that  a  rational  jury  could  not  find  in  its  favor.\" \nChertkova v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 92 F.3d 81, 86 (2d Cir. 1996). \nI.  Federal Constitutional Claims \nPlaintiffs have brought federal constitutional claims for violations \nof the First, Fourth, and Fourteen Amendments under 28 U.S.C. §  1983, \nwhich \"creates a  cause of action against any person who, acting under \ncolor of state law,  abridges 'rights, privileges, or immunities secured by \nthe Constitution and laws' of the United States.\"  See Shakhnes v. Berlin, \n689 F.3d 244, 250 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting 42 U.S.C. §  1983).  Defendants \nmove for summary judgment on all claims. \n- 5 -\n\na.  Kelly and Esposito's Personal Involvement \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  defendants  Raymond  Kelly  and  Joseph \nEsposito  argue  that  claims  against  them  fail  due  to  lack  of personal \ninvolvement.  \"Personal  involvement  of  defendants  in  alleged \nconstitutional  deprivations  is  a  prerequisite  to  an  award  of  damages \nunder§ 1983.\"  Farrell  v.  Burke, 449 F.3d 470, 484 (2d Cir.  2006).  A \ndefendant in a  §  1983 action may not be held liable merely because he \nholds a high position of authority.  Wright v.  Smith, 21 F.3d 496, 501 (2d \nCir. 1994). \nAt the time of the protest, Raymond Kelly was the Commissioner of \nthe NYPD and Joseph Esposito was the Chief of Department of the NYPD. \nThe  amended  complaint  barely  mentions  either  defendant,  and  it  is \nundisputed  that  neither  was  at  the  scene  of  the  protest.  In  their \nopposition brief, plaintiffs belatedly raise theories of supervisory liability \nunder Monell v.  Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), and \nof respondeat superior,  but they failed to plead either theory even after \namending  their  complaint.  Given  the  evidence  in  the  record,  no \nreasonable  jury  could  find  that  defendants  Kelly  and  Esposito  were \nsufficiently involved in this incident to establish liability under§ 1983. \nIn  sum,  plaintiffs' §  1983 claims fail  as to  defendants  Kelly  and \nEsposito  for  lack  of personal involvement in  the  alleged  constitutional \n- 6 -\n\ndeprivations.!  The  court  will  now  consider  claims  as  to  all  other \ndefendants. \nb.  Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment False-Arrest Claim \nPlaintiffs  claim  that their detention  constituted  a  false  arrest in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.  A claim for false arrest \"resting on \nthe Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures ... is \nsubstantially the same as a  claim for false arrest under New York law.\" \nWeyant  v.  Okst,  101  F.3d  845,  852  (2d  Cir.  1996)  (citations  omitted). \nUnder  New  York  law,  a  plaintiff must  satisfy  four  elements:  \"(1)  the \ndefendant intended to confine the plaintiff, (2) the plaintiff was conscious \nof the confinement, (3)  the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement, \nand (4)  the confinement was not otherwise privileged.\"  Bernard v.  United \nStates,  25  F.3d 98,  102  (2d  Cir.  1994).  Defendants concede  the  first \nthree elements. \nWhere  police  detain  someone without a  warrant,  a  presumption \narises that the detention was unlawful and the burden shifts for proving \nprivilege to confine. See Jenkins v.  City of New York, 478 F.3d 76, 88 (2d \nCir.  2007).  Defendants  here  do  not claim  to  have  had  a  warrant  to \ndetain the protestors, nor do they attempt to establish probable cause for \nthe detention.  In fact,  defendants freely admit that police officers knew \n1 In their reply brief, defendants raise for the first time the argument that claims against \ndefendants  James  McNamara  and  Peter  Loehle  also  fail  for  lack  of  personal \ninvolvement.  \"Arguments made for the first time in a reply brief need not be considered \nby a court,\" and the court declines to consider them here.  See Playboy Enters., Inc.  v. \nDumas, 960 F. Supp. 710, 720 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). \n- 7 -\n\nof no specific threats to the President that night and that officers did not \nobserve the protestors threatening any violence or criminal activity in the \npress pen.  See Latalardo Dep.  47:22-24, 48: 10-14; Hart Dep.  58:8-14, \n93: 11-13; Purtell Dep. 66:24-67:3, 72:6-9. \nDefendants' principal argument is that their actions were essential \nto  ensure the President's safety.  They also  argue that large groups of \nprotestors necessarily pose enhanced security risks.  To cast this in more \nlegalistic  terms,  defendants assert that \"special needs\"  associated with \nthe President's visit privileged their actions. \nIt  may  be  true  that certain  circumstances justify  police  officers \ntemporarily  detaining  people  to  protect  the  President,  and  that  large \ncrowds  may  sometimes  pose  higher  risks.  But  even  defendant  Peter \nLoehle,  the  NYPD  sector  commander  for  the  area  encompassing  the \nSheraton, admitted that he was unaware of any reason why his officers \nclosed the press pen on four sides and detained the protestors within. \nLoehle Dep. 65:11-15, 66:19-24.  He also testified that he was unaware \nof any reason why his officers had failed to follow the written NYPD policy \nof allowing protestors \"to leave the barrier area at any time.\"  Loehle Dep. \n110:5-16. \nTo  be sure, defendants set forth an array of possible justifications \nfor  the  detention,  chief  among  them  the  undoubted  importance  of \nensuring the  President's  security.  But defendants fail  to  identify who \ngave  the  order  to  detain  the  protestors,  thereby  obscuring  the  actual \n- 8 -\n\nreason for the detention.  Moreover, circumstantial evidence casts doubt \non defendants' purported justifications, particularly the fact that police \nofficers froze  the press pen even though \nSee  Purtell  Dep.  60: 17-63:4;  Loehle  Dep.  65:4-10, \n66:19-24;  All this uncertainty provides a  genuine issue \nof material  fact  for  the jury to  decide  as  to  why the  protestors  were \ndetained.  Without making this factual determination, it is impossible to \nassess defendants' claimed privilege. \nIn sum, the evidence in the record could allow a reasonable jury to \nfind that such a detention violated the Fourth Amendment.  For example, \na  reasonable  jury  could  conclude  that  police  officers  singled  out  the \nprotestors  for  detention  because  they  were protestors-as  opposed  to \njournalists or tourists-and that the officers had impermissible motives \nwhen they did so.  Of course, a jury might not draw these inferences in \nplaintiffs' favor at trial, but they are still the jury's inferences to draw. \nAccordingly, defendants have failed to show that they are entitled \nto  summary  judgment  on  plaintiffs'  Fourth  Amendment  false-arrest \nclaim. \nc.  Plaintiffs' First Amendment Retaliation Claim \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  their  detention  also  violated  the  First \nAmendment  because  it  was  retaliation  for  their  protest  and  their \nassociation  with  Occupy  Wall  Street.  To  establish  a  claim  for  First \n- 9 -\n\nAmendment retaliation,  a  plaintiff must satisfy three elements:  \"(1)  he \nhas a right protected by the First Amendment; (2) the defendant's actions \nwere motivated or substantially caused by his exercise of that right; and \n(3)  the defendant's actions caused him some injury.\"  Dorsett v.  Cty.  of \nNassau, 732 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir. 2013).  The injury need not be chilled \nspeech, which \"is not the sine qua non of a First Amendment claim,\" and \na  plaintiff may prevail \"if he can show either that his speech has been \nadversely affected by the government retaliation or that he has suffered \nsome other concrete harm.\"  Id. (third emphasis added) \nAs to the first element, it is undeniable that the First Amendment \nprotects the right to engage in peaceful protest directed at the President. \nSee, e.g.,  Watts v.  United States, 394 U.S. 705, 708 (1969).  And as to the \nthird  element,  the  alleged  injury  is  the  detention  itself,  which  clearly \nconstitutes a \"concrete harm.\"  See generally Gill v. Pidlypchak, 389 F.3d \n379, 381-84 (2d Cir. 2004).  The key dispute, then, concerns the second \nelement:  whether  the  officers'  actions  were  motivated  or  substantially \ncaused by the protestors' exercise of their First Amendment rights.  In \nshort,  was  there  a  causal  connection  between  the  speech  and  the \ndetention? \nCircumstantial evidence of retaliatory intent may supply the causal \nconnection  between  a  plaintiffs  protected  speech  and  a  defendant's \nadverse action.  Gronowski v.  Spencer, 424 F.3d 285, 293 (2d Cir. 2005). \nAs  discussed above,  there exists a  genuine issue of material fact as to \n- 10 -\n\nwhy the protestors were detained, and a  reasonable jury could find that \nit was simply \"for being a protestor.\"  See Dkt. 110, Video Ex.  13 at 4:30. \nNot only did police officers at the scene allegedly make statements to that \neffect,  but they also allowed journalists and tourists to  leave  the press \npen while refusing similar requests from the protestors.  Moreover,  the \npress pen was \nyet police officers unquestionably prevented \nprotestors from leaving. \nIn  short,  because  the  court cannot  glean  from  the  record  what \nactually  motivated  police  officers  to  detain  the  protestors,  defendants \ncannot show they are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' First \nAmendment retaliation claim. \nd.  Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment Selective-Enforcement Claim \nPlaintiffs  also  claim  that defendants  subjected  them to  selective \nenforcement,  in violation of the  Fourteenth Amendment's  guarantee of \nequal  protection.  To  establish  a  claim  for  selective  enforcement,  a \nplaintiff must satisfy two elements: \"(1) that the [plaintiff], compared with \nothers  similarly  situated,  was  selectively  treated;  and  (2)  that  such \nselective treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as \nrace,  religion,  intent to  inhibit or punish the exercise  of constitutional \nrights,  or  malicious  or  bad faith  intent to  injure  a  person.\"  Freedom \nHoldings, Inc.  v.  Spitzer, 357 F.3d 205, 234 (2d Cir. 2004) (alteration and \ncitation omitted).  \"Generally, whether two entities are similarly situated \n- 11 -\n\nis a factual issue that should be submitted to the jury.\"  Cine SKB, Inc.  v. \nTown of Henrietta, 507 F.3d 778, 790 (2d Cir. 2007) \nHere, as detailed above, a  genuine issue of material fact exists as \nto the actual reason for detaining the protestors.  A reasonable jury could \nfind that plaintiffs satisfy both elements of a  selective-enforcement claim \nby crediting evidence that police officers detained protestors due to their \nprotected speech.  The protestors were certainly \"treated differently\" from \nother people near the Sheraton that night.  See Harlen Assocs. v.  Inc.  Vill. \nof Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 (2d Cir. 2001).  While the protestors were \nconfined to the press pen, others were allowed to leave, and traffic moved \nfreely  along  Seventh Avenue  between  the  detained  protestors  and  the \nPresident's event. \nDefendants  argue  that  this  claim  must  fail  because  plaintiffs \n\"cannot  identify  other  groups  consisting  of  scores  of  protestors  who \neschewed  a  designated  protest  area,  attempted  to  approach  the \npresident, and supplanted a  designated area across the street from the \nPresident.\"  Dfs.' Mem.  L.  at  15.  This  degree  of extreme  similarity is \nunrealistic and unnecessary.  Rather,  \"[t]he  test is whether a  prudent \nperson,  looking objectively  at the  incidents,  would think them roughly \nequivalent.\"  Penlyn Dev. Corp.  v.  Inc.  Vill.  of Lloyd Harbor, 51 F. Supp. 2d \n255,  264  (E.D.N.Y.  1999).  \"Exact  correlation  is  neither  likely  nor \nnecessary.\"  Id. \n- 12 -\n\nMore  importantly,  the  protestors'  status  as  protestors  cannot \ndistinguish  them and thereby establish that no  one  at the  scene was \nsimilarly  situated.  Were  that  sufficient,  the  second  element  of  a \nselective-enforcement claim would be nonsensical in many cases, as this \nsimple hypothetical reveals.  Imagine two people at a parade.  The first is \na  vocal  woman  who  is  enthusiastically  exercising  her  constitutional \nrights  by  chanting political  songs;  the  second  is  a  silent man who  is \nsimply  watching  the  parade  pass  by.  Police  officers  force  the  vocal \nwoman  to  leave  the parade but do  nothing to  the  silent man.  Under \ndefendants' theory, the officers could admit that they targeted the vocal \nwoman \"to inhibit or punish the exercise of [her]  constitutional rights,\" \nFreedom Holdings, 357 F.3d at 234, but still prevail by showing that she \nwas the only one exercising those rights.  That is not the law of selective \nenforcement. \nGiven the disputed factual issues that endure, defendants cannot \nobtain  summary judgment plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment selective-\nenforcement claim.2 \ne.  Plaintiffs' Failure-to-Intervene Claim \nIn  conjunction  with  their  First,  Fourth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment  claims,  plaintiffs  bring  a  separate  claim  alleging  that \n2  Plaintiffs' opposition brief explicitly cabins their Fourteenth Amendment claim to a \ntheory of equal protection and fails to respond to defendants' arguments as to the due \nprocess  claim  found  in  plaintiffs'  amended  complaint.  It  appears,  therefore,  that \nplaintiffs have abandoned any claim based on the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee \nof due process. \n- 13 -\n\ndefendants  failed  to  intervene  during  the  detention.  Even  where  an \nofficer did not personally effect an arrest, he may be held liable for failing \nto intervene where \"that officer observes or has reason to know ... that a \ncitizen  has  been  unjustifiably  arrested\"  or  \"that  any  constitutional \nviolation has been committed by a law enforcement official.\"  Anderson v. \nBranen, 17 F.3d 552, 557 (2d Cir. 1994). \nGiven the material factual disputes that remain, defendants cannot \nobtain summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim for failure to intervene.  If \nthe jury credits plaintiffs' evidence, defendants James McNamara, Peter \nLoehle,  and Stephen Latalardo  could  all be  liable  for  failing  to  protect \nplaintiffs'  constitutional  rights.  Defendant  McNamara  was  the  NYPD \nofficer who had command of the area surrounding the Sheraton on the \nnight of the protest, and other officers testified that he likely knew of the \norders to hold the protestors.  See Purtell Dep. 37:23-39:3, 39:18-41:12. \nDe fen dan t  Loehle  was  the  NYPD  sector  commander  for  the  area \nencompassing the Sheraton, and there is evidence suggesting he was in \ncharge of carrying out the order to freeze the area that included the press \npen.  See Hart Dep. 56:15-57:24.  Finally, defendant Latalardo admits he \nmight have been the officer who actually closed the press pen, and that \nhe  was  the  one  who  opened  it  after  the  President's  departure.  See \nLatalardo Dep. 41:10-22, 43:16-20, 46:3-5.  Taken together, these facts, \nwhich a reasonable jury could find, could show that each officer failed to \nact despite knowing or having reason to  know that the protestors had \n- 14-\n\nbeen  \"unjustifiably\"  detained  or  that a  fellow  officer  had committed  a \n\"constitutional violation.\"  See Anderson v. Branen, 17 F.3d at 557. \nAccordingly,  defendants have failed to show that they are entitled \nto summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim for failure to intervene. \nf.  Defendants' Qualified-Immunity Defense \nDefendants invoke qualified immunity as to all of plaintiffs'§ 1983 \nclaims.  Qualified  immunity  shields  officials  from  liability  for  civil \ndamages to the extent their conduct \"does not violate clearly established \nstatutory or  constitutional rights  of which  a  reasonable  person would \nhave  known.\"  Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800,  818  (1982).  \"The \ncontours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a  reasonable official \nwould understand that what he is doing violates that right.\"  Anderson v. \nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987). \nIf the law is \"clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily \nshould fail, since a reasonably competent public official should know the \nlaw governing his conduct.\"  Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818-19.  That is not to \nsay that \"the very action in question [must have]  previously been held \nunlawful.\"  Id.  Rather, so long as the unlawfulness is \"apparent\" in light \nof \"pre-existing law,\"  public  officials  \"can  still  be  on  notice  that their \nconduct violates  established law even  in  novel  factual  circumstances.\" \nHope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739, 741 (2002) (citations omitted). \nThe parties fiercely  dispute the true motivation for the detention. \nAlthough  defendants  now  invoke  presidential  security,  plaintiffs  allege \n- 15 -\n\nthat  something  more  sinister  led  police  officers  to  single  out  the \nprotestors  for  different  treatment  that  night.  \"Where  the  objective \nreasonableness of state action depends on credibility determinations, a \ngenuine  issue  of  material  fact  precludes  summary judgment\"  on  the \nissue of qualified immunity.  Santulli v.  Russello,  519 F.  App'x 706, 709 \n(2d Cir. 2013) (citing Dillon v.  Morano, 497 F.3d 247, 253 (2d Cir. 2007)). \nHere,  the court cannot assess defendants' purported immunity without \nwading into factual disputes that must be left for a jury. \nIf a jury were to credit plaintiffs' evidence, clearly established law \nat the time of their detention could support each of their §  1983 claims. \nA reasonable jury could find that police officers detained the protestors, \nwithout  probable  cause  or  a  warrant,  due  to  a  motive  that  belies \ndefendants' claimed privilege.  This the Fourth Amendment clearly would \nnot permit.  See Golino v.  City of New Haven, 950 F.2d 864, 870 (2d Cir. \n1991)  (\"The  right  not  to  be  arrested  or  prosecuted  without  probable \ncause  has,  of  course,  long  been  a  clearly  established  constitutional \nright.\").  A  reasonable  jury  could  also  find  that  the  protestors  were \ndetained  as  retaliation  for  their  association  with  Occupy  Wall  Street. \nThis the First Amendment clearly would not permit.  See Santulli, 519 F. \nApp'x at 708-09 (\"It is clearly established that a  person has the right to \nbe free from retaliation for an exercise of First Amendment rights.\").  And \na  reasonable jury could find  that police  officers  selectively treated  the \nprotestors in order to punish them for their speech.  This the Fourteenth \n- 16 -\n\nAmendment clearly would  not  permit.  See  Bums  v.  Citarella,  443  F. \nSupp.  2d  464,  470  (S.D.N.Y.  2006)  (\"It  is  []  clearly  established  that \nselective  enforcement  ...  based  on  an  official's  dislike  of  protected \nexpressiOn  is  unlawful.\").  Finally,  having  made  these  findings,  a \nreasonable  jury  could  conclude  that  police  officers  violated  clearly \nestablished rights by failing to intervene when they knew or should have \nknown of the detention.  See Anderson v.  Branen,  17 F.3d at 557 (\"It is \nwidely recognized that all law enforcement officials  have an affirmative \nduty  to  intervene  to  protect  the  constitutional  rights  of citizens  from \ninfringement by other law enforcement officers in their presence.\"). \nFor these  reasons,  defendants have  failed  to  show that they are \nentitled to qualified immunity. \nII.  State Constitutional Claims \nPlaintiffs  also  plead  various  state  constitutional  claims,  which \ndefendants  argue  must  be  dismissed  because  adequate  alternative \nremedies exist.  Where a  plaintiff has alternate remedies available under \na  federal statute such as 28 U.S.C. §  1983, \"her state constitutional tort \nclaim is redundant and precluded.\"  Biswas v.  City of New York,  973 F. \nSupp.  2d  504,  522  (S.D.N.Y.  2013).  Plaintiffs' opposition ignores  this \nargument raised by defendants, yet the principle is sufficient to defeat \nthe state constitutional claims as a matter of law. \nThe  court  therefore  grants  defendants'  motion  for  summary \njudgment as to these claims. \n- 17 -\n\nConclusion \nOn  a  motion  for  summary  judgment,  the  movant  faces  a \ndemanding standard if the court is to deprive the nonmovant of a jury \ndetermination.  Defendants  have  met  their  burden  on  plaintiffs'  state \nconstitutional  claims,  but  have  failed  to  do  so  on  plaintiffs'  federal \nconstitutional  claims,  except  as  to  defendants  Kelly  and  Esposito. \nAccordingly,  the motion for  summary judgment is granted in part and \ndenied in part. \nSO ORDERED \nDated:  New York, New York \nAugust 10, 2016 \nThomas P.

In this civil rights class action against police officers of the New York City Police \nDepartment (the “NYPD”), Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter, individually and on behalf \nof a class of all others similarly situated, seek damages and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 to redress violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution and the constitution of the State of New York.  \n2.  These violations occurred when, on November 30, 2011, Plaintiffs sought to \ndemonstrate in affiliation with the Occupy Wall Street (“OWS”) movement and the NYPD \nwithout any reason or cause detained them for nearly two hours inside an interlocking metal \nbarricade.  The  NYPD  prohibited  Plaintiffs  from  exiting  the  pen  because  they  were  OWS \ndemonstrators, while permitting tourists and journalists to leave. Plaintiffs, numbering between \n70 and 120 people, were never charged with any violation, misdemeanor, or crime.   \n3.  The NYPD’s actions violated a provision of the NYPD Patrol Guide mandated by \norder of the Honorable Robert Sweet, United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nNew York, in Stauber v. City of New York, 03 Civ. 9163, dated March 31, 2008 which states: \nBarrier configuration for demonstrations should not unreasonably \nrestrict  access  to  and  participation  in  the  event.  For  example, \nattendees should be permitted to leave a barricaded area at any \ntime.  In  addition,  if  crowd  conditions  and  other  circumstances \npermit, participants should be permitted to leave and return to the \nsame  area.  Sufficient  openings  in  the  barricades  should  be \nmaintained  for  purpose  of  permitted  attendees  to  leave \nexpeditiously  and  return  to  the  event  as  described  in  this \nparagraph. \n \n4.  Defendants  violated  Plaintiffs’  clear  and  established  constitutional  rights, \nincluding their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, and \nfreedom from unreasonable seizure.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 3 of 22\n \n5.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter are New Yorkers who have voiced their \nsupport  for  change  in  the  past  and  who  have  plans  to  demonstrate  in  New  York  City  in \nassociation with OWS in the coming months. As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions \nunder the color of state law and in the scope of their employment with the NYPD, including their \nviolation of an express court order, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights have been chilled and \nthere is a real and immediate threat that their constitutional rights will be violated by the NYPD \nagain. \n6.  By this action, Plaintiffs seek redress for the violations of their constitutional and \ncivil rights and to recover damages they suffered as a result of this incident. Plaintiffs further \nseek an order enjoining the NYPD from unlawful use of barricades and compelling the NYPD to \ncomply with court orders restricting the use of pens.    \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over federal claims  pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343 (3-4). \n8.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 for violations of \nPlaintiffs’  rights  under  the  First,  Fourth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n9.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) in that Plaintiffs’ claims arose in \nthe Southern District of New York. \nPARTIES \n \nNamed Plaintiffs \n \n10.

He is sued in both his individual and official capacity.  \n17.  Defendant  DEPUTY  CHIEF  JAMES  MCNAMARA  (“Deputy  Chief \nMcNamara”) is and was at all times a Deputy Chief of the NYPD Department and is responsible, \nin whole and/or in part, for the creation, implementation, promulgation and enforcement of the \npolicies, practices and/or customs complained of herein.

Defendants were acting for and on behalf of the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 6 of 22\n \nNYPD at all times relevant herein, with the power and authority vested in them as officers, \nagents and employees of the NYPD and incidental to the lawful pursuit of their duties as officers, \nemployees and agents of the NYPD. \n21.  At all times relevant herein, Defendants violated clearly established constitutional \nstandards under First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of which a reasonable police officer \nand/or public official under their respective circumstances would have known.  \n22.  Defendants’  acts  hereafter  complained  of  were  carried  out  intentionally, \nrecklessly, with malice and/or gross disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n23.  On March 31, 2008, the Honorable Robert Sweet, United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York, so-ordered a stipulation entered into and agreed to by the \nCity of New York (the “City”) in the case captioned Ann Stauber and the New York Civil \nLiberties Union v. the City of New York, et al., 03 Civ. 9162 (the “Stauber Settlement and \nOrder”) (Ex. A hereto). \n24.  The Stauber Settlement and Order arose from actions brought against the City, \namong others, asserting, inter alia, that the NYPD’s policy and/or practice of using interlocking \nmetal barricades, or “pens,” to confine demonstrators in fixed locations violated the Constitution. \n25.  In the Stauber Settlement and Order, the City agreed to insert in the NYPD Patrol \nGuide the following: \nNote:  In  cases  in  which  the  special  event  is  a  demonstration, \ninformation  on  expected  street  and  sidewalk  closings  and \ninformation on how the public may access a demonstration site \nwill be disseminated to the media and to event organizers and \nshould,  if  possible,  be  posted  on  the  Department’s  website. \nOfficers  assigned  to  such  events  should  be  given  detailed \ninstructions  on  such  closings  and  points  of  access  prior  to \nassignment. Detail supervisors should also be advised of street \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 7 of 22\n \nclosures and points of access and any changes of points of access \nwhich  occur  during  the  event  and  which  were  not  previously \nanticipated and publicized. Officers assigned to such events shall \nprovide information to the public at the event about a available \npoints of access. \n \n26.  In the Stauber Settlement and Order, the City agreed to insert in the NYPD Patrol \nGuide the following: \nBarrier  configuration  for  demonstrations  should  not \nunreasonably  restrict  access  to  and  participation  in  the \nevent. For example, attendees should be permitted to leave \na  barricaded  area  at  any  time.  In  addition,  if  crowd \nconditions  and  other  circumstances  permit,  participants \nshould be permitted to leave and return to the same area. \nSufficient openings in the barricades should be maintained \nfor purpose of permitted attendees to leave expeditiously \nand return to the event as described in this paragraph. \n \n27.  Commissioner Kelly was a party to the Stauber Settlement and Order.  \nA Demonstration for the President, November 30, 2011 \n28.  Upon information and belief, on November 30, 2011, President Barak Obama \nattended a fundraiser dinner at the Sheraton Hotel (the “Hotel”) in New York, New York. \n29.  At  approximately  8:00  p.m.,  about  100  people  affiliated  with  OWS  events, \nincluding Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter, sought to demonstrate in front of the Hotel \nwhile the President arrived for the fundraiser dinner.  \n30.  Plaintiffs sought to demonstrate near the President and the media covering the \nPresident’s event at the Hotel. \n31.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, Jetter, and others walked to the Hotel in a group. \n32.  Plaintiffs carried signs with the intention of sharing messages with the President \nand the media covering the President’s event. Kida carried a sign that said, “Get money out of \npolitics.” Berg carried a sign protesting the National Defense Authorization Act. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 8 of 22\n \n33.  The Hotel is located on the eastern side of Seventh Avenue between 52nd and 53rd \nStreets.  \n34.  When Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter attempted to approach the Hotel, \nthey found that the NYPD had erected a barricade with interlocking metal fences approximately \nthree-feet tall on Seventh Avenue, across the street from the Hotel at the southwest corner of 53rd \nStreet.  \n35.  The barricade created a “U” shape that extended west on 53rd Street toward \nBroadway for approximately 100 feet, such that there was an opening into and out of the \nbarricade area on 53rd street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway.  \n36.   The barricades that made up the “U” were locked when Berg, Kida, Rivera, \nRozental and Jetter arrived.  \n37.  Defendants told Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter in sum or substance that \nthe only place they could stand was inside this locked “U” configuration of barricades. \n38.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, Jetter and others moved into the center of the “U”-\nshaped configuration and waited for the President to arrive.  \n39.   Because  of  the  configuration  of  the  barricade,  it  was  not  possible  for  the \ndemonstrators to get any closer to the Hotel entrance or the media covering the President’s visit.  \n40.  Sanitation trucks blocked the view from the Hotel entrance to the barricaded area.  \n41.  At approximately 8:30 p.m., Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter moved into \nthe NYPD barricades toward the east side, i.e., closer to the Hotel, in order to be as close as \npossible to the President when he arrived. \n42.  At approximately 8:41 p.m., Defendants brought barricades from further west on \n53rd Street and closed the opening of the barricaded area, turning the “U” shaped barricade into a \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 9 of 22\n \nrectangular confined area or pen. \n43.  Upon information and belief, pursuant to customary practice, Chief Esposito’s \noffice would have to receive notice of and give consent for the closing of the pen.  \n44.  Defendants told Plaintiffs in sum or substance that they were not permitted to exit \nthe pen.  \n45.  One Defendant, in sum and substance, told Jetter that he was not free to leave and \nthat he would be arrested if he attempted to leave the pen. Upon information and belief, other \nPlaintiffs were told the same. \n46.  Defendants prevented the Plaintiffs from exiting the pen. \n47.  Defendant John Doe directed communication directing the pen to be closed and \nthe plaintiffs to be held. \n48.  Defendant Insp. Loehle and Deputy Chief James McNamara ratified with their \nsilence the order to pen the protestors and knew the plaintiffs were not being released \nthereby failing to intervene in the unconstitutional conduct.  \n49.  Defendant Lt. Latardo was the ranking officer who closed the pens and held \nthe plaintiffs.  He knew the plaintiffs were not being released thereby failing to intervene in \nthe unconstitutional conduct.     \n50.  For example, Rivera, Jetter and others attempted to leave the pen at 9:15 p.m.  \nafter learning that the President had arrived and entered the Hotel, but were prohibited from \ndoing so by Defendants.  \n51.  Plaintiffs were held in the pen for nearly two hours. \n52.  During that time, Plaintiffs who sought to leave the pen were prohibited from \ndoing so by Defendants.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 10 of 22\n \n53.  Defendants prohibited Plaintiffs from exiting the pen for any reason. \n54.  Defendants prohibited Plaintiffs from exiting the pen to use the restroom or to get \nfood.  \n55.  Plaintiffs who became ill were only able to leave the pen when taken by an \nambulance. \n56.  For example, one demonstrator, Lisa Rubenstein, who felt ill inside the pen, was \ntaken away by ambulance only after fainting inside the closed pen. \n57.   Jetter, who was feeling too sick to remain at the demonstration, was forced to \nstay despite a fever.  \n58.  During the time that Plaintiffs were trapped in the pen, traffic was moving freely \non Seventh Avenue. \n59.  During the time that Plaintiffs were trapped in the pen, pedestrians were moving \nfreely on Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street, on the north and east corners of the intersection.  \n60.  At approximately 10:26 p.m., nearly two hours after the pen was initially closed \noff  and  nearly  two  hours  after  Plaintiffs  were  trapped  by  Defendants  inside  the  pen,  the \nbarricades were removed from the west side of the pen. \n61.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs were treated differently than others at the \nsame intersection at the same time.  \n62.  Defendants told Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter in sum or substance that \nthey were being held because they were protestors.  \n63.  Upon information and belief, tourists who were trapped in the pen were permitted \nto exit the pen while demonstrators were held. \n64.  Upon information and belief, journalists were permitted to exit the pen while \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 11 of 22\n \ndemonstrators were held. For example, upon information and belief, Josh Robin from NY 1 was \nreleased from the pen at 9:10 p.m., upon his request.  \n65.  Upon information and belief, legal observers and members of the press were \nunable to enter the pen and access Plaintiffs. For example: legal observer Tamara Bedic could \nnot get any closer to the demonstrators than the corner of Broadway and 53rd Streets; journalists \nJosh Harkinson (Mother Jones), Meg Robertson (MSNBC) and Andrew Katz (Brooklyn Ink), \nwere not allowed to approach the pen on foot from the West; when Mr. Harkinson and Mr. Katz \nwere later able to approach by taking a cab south on 7th Avenue, they were escorted away from \nthe area when they began talking to demonstrators in the pen.  \n66.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter were not charged with any violation, \nmisdemeanor or crime. \n67.  Upon  information  and  belief,  none  of  the  Plaintiffs  was  charged  with  any \nviolation, misdemeanor, or crime. \n68.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs were held in the pen because of their \naffiliation with the OWS movement. \n69.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter are active in the OWS movement and \nhave plans to attend demonstrations affiliated with OWS in New York City the next few months.  \n70.  Plaintiffs have avoided demonstrations after the November 30, 2011, incident for \nfear  of  becoming  trapped  in  an  NYPD  erected  pen.  For  example,  Berg  did  not  attend  a \ndemonstration  she  would  have  otherwise  attended  at  another  presidential  fundraiser,  and \nabandoned demonstrations where NYPD appeared with barricade fences, due to fear of being \ntrapped in such a pen again. \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 12 of 22\n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n71.  Pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Berg, \nKida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter seek to represent persons who were detained in the pen erected \nby the NYPD at Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street on the evening of November 30, 2011.  \n72.  The  members  of  the  class,  believed  to  number  between  70  and  120,  are  so \nnumerous as to render joinder impracticable. Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter currently \nhave information identifying at least 47 class members. \n73.  In addition, joinder is impracticable because many members of the class live \noutside of New York State and some live outside of the United States. Moreover, many class \nmembers who have been victimized by the defendants’ unconstitutional policies and practices \nmay not bring individual claims. There is no adequate avenue for the protection of the class \nmembers’ constitutional rights other than a class action.  \n74.  The class members share a number of questions of law and fact in common, \nincluding but not limited to the following: \ni.  Whether interlocking barricades were erected and maintained on the evening \nof November 30, 2011 in a manner that amounted to an unlawful seizure in \ncontravention of the Fourth Amendment. \nii.  Whether interlocking barricades were erected and maintained on the evening \nof November 30, 2011 in a way that constituted an unreasonable restriction on \nspeech in contravention of the First Amendment. \niii.  Whether the NYPD targeted the Plaintiffs on November 30, 2011, because of \ntheir perceived association with OWS in violation of the equal protection \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 13 of 22\n \n75.  These common questions of fact and law all flow from the same policies, enacted \nby the same defendants, and implemented by the same named and unnamed defendants.  \n76.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of those of the class in that, inter \nalia, at the time their constitutional rights were violated, they were engaging and attempting to \nengage in activities protected by the First Amendment and they were treated by the NYPD in the \nsame manner as members of the class, resulting in violations of their First, Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights under the United States Constitution.  \n77.  The named plaintiffs have a strong personal interest in the outcome of this action, \nhave no conflicts of interest with members of the plaintiff class, and will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class. Moreover, the named plaintiffs reside in the New York area and \nintend to continue to participate in demonstrations in New York City, where the defendants’ \nunconstitutional policies, practices and customs are implemented, and therefore remain at high \nrisk of being unconstitutionally harmed in the future pursuant to these policies, practices and \ncustoms.  \n78.  The named plaintiffs are represented by the undersigned counsel, civil rights \nlawyers with experience litigating a wide range of civil rights and class action lawsuits.  \ni.  RANKIN & TAYLOR PLLC has broad civil rights experience from litigating \nmatters in numerous contexts.  The firm handles a strong ongoing police \nmisconduct  docket  in  both  state  and  federal  court.  They  have  also  won \nsignificant victories in the employment context.  In addition to individual \nplaintiff  actions,  RANKIN  &  TAYLOR,  in  partnership  with  two  solo \npractitioners, handled a mass action of over 80 plaintiffs arrested during the \nNYPD's crackdown on Critical Mass bike rides, Callaghan v. City of New \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 14 of 22\n \nYork, 07-cv-9611, and has litigated several other multiple plaintiff matters \nover  public  assembly  issues,  property  confiscations,  and  wage  and  hour \nviolations.  The firm's eight attorneys represent significant experience and \nresources in handling complex actions.  \nii.  Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP, a New York law firm founded in 1964 with \nan extensive civil and criminal practice that has handled police misconduct \nand constitutional litigation for almost thirty years, has extensive experience \nlitigating  civil  rights  cases  and  class  action  lawsuits.  Representative  civil \nrights cases in which Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP has acted as class \ncounsel include: MacNamara, et al., v. the City of New York, 04 Civ. 09216 \n(S.D.N.Y.) (RJS)(JCF) (challenging the arrest and detention of demonstrators \nat the 2004 Republican National Convention, recently granted class status); \nDaniels v. New York, 99 Civ. 1695 (S.D.N.Y.) (SAS) (challenging the City’s \npolicy and practice of suspicionless and race-based stops and frisks); Burley et \nal. v. City of New York, et al., 03 Civ. 735 (S.D.N.Y.) (Pauley, J.) (challenging \nexcessive detention of demonstrators arrested for minor offenses during the \n2002 World Economic Forum).  \n79.  Counsel  for  the  plaintiffs  have  the  resources,  expertise,  and  experience  to \nprosecute this action. Counsel for the plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the class \nor between the attorneys and members of the class.  \n80.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. The class is readily defined and prosecution of a class action \nwill eliminate the possibility of repetitious litigation, while also providing redress for claims \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 86   Filed 12/18/15   Page 15 of 22\n \nwhich may not be large enough to warrant the expense of individual litigation.  \n81.  All named plaintiffs and class members were victimized by the same policies, \npractices,  customs  and/or  conduct  and  thus  common  questions  of  law  and  fact  greatly \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, including legal and factual \nissues relating to damages. \n82.  The plaintiff class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) because \nquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting \nonly individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly \nand efficiently adjudicating the controversy. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nPURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nDEPRIVATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS  \nUNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n   \n83.  Plaintiffs reiterate paragraph 1 through  82 and incorporate such by reference \nherein. \n84.

The alleged violations occurred on November 30, 2011.  \nPlaintiffs attended a protest as part of the Occupy Wall Street movement, \nand NYPD officers allegedly refused to allow plaintiffs to exit a barricaded \narea for approximately two hours.  On March 6, 2013, defendants moved \nfor judgment on the pleadings for failure to state a claim and failure to \nfulfill conditions precedent to suit.   \n  Defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied.  \n\nThe Complaint \nPlaintiffs Phoebe Berg, Toshiro Kida, John Rivera, Dayna Rozental, \nJonathan Jetter, and others similarly situated are protesters affiliated \nwith the Occupy Wall Street movement.  Defendants are named and \nunnamed NYPD officers, including Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly \nand Chief of the New York City Police Department Joseph Esposito.   \n  At 8:00 p.m. on November 30, 2011, plaintiffs attended a \ndemonstration with approximately 100 other protestors outside the \nSheraton Hotel, located on Seventh Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street.  \nPlaintiffs chose this time and place for their demonstration because they \nknew that President Obama planned to attend a fundraising event at the \nhotel that evening.  Defendants erected barricades in a “U” shape across \nthe street from the Sheraton Hotel at the southwest corner of 53rd Street.  \nThe barricade extended west on 53rd Street toward Broadway for \napproximately 100 feet, creating an opening for entry and exit on 53rd \nStreet.   \n  When plaintiffs arrived, NYPD officers locked the barricades and \ntold plaintiffs that they were only permitted to stand within the \nbarricaded area.  At 8:41 p.m., defendants brought additional barricades \nto close the opening of the area in which plaintiffs were standing.  These \nbarricades converted the “U”-shaped area into a confined, rectangular \npen.  Plaintiffs allege that defendants allowed tourists and journalists to \nexit the barricaded area but threatened to arrest plaintiffs if they tried to \n  - 2 - \n\nleave.  Defendants allegedly told plaintiffs that they were being held \nbecause they were protestors.   \nPlaintiffs claim that defendants only permitted protestors who \nbecame ill to leave if they were taken by ambulance.  For example, \nparamedics took one protestor, Lisa Rubenstein, out of the pen after she \nfainted inside the closed area.  Plaintiff Jetter was not allowed to leave \ndespite feeling ill and suffering from a fever.  Ultimately, the NYPD \nofficers allegedly held plaintiffs in the pen for one hour and forty-five \nminutes and neither arrested them nor charged them with any crime.   \n  Plaintiffs plan to attend future demonstrations affiliated with the \nOccupy Wall Street movement but allege that they have thus far avoided \nsuch demonstrations for fear of becoming trapped in an NYPD-erected \npen.   \nDiscussion \n \n  In deciding a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), the court “appl[ies] the same standard as that \napplicable to a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations \ncontained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences \nin favor of the nonmoving party.”  King v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 284 F.3d \n352 (2d Cir. 2002).  A Rule 12(c) motion is granted only where “from the \npleadings, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  \nDargahi v. Honda Lease Trust, 370 Fed. App’x 172, 174 (2d Cir. 2010).    \n  - 3 - \n\nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a \ncomplaint must plead sufficient facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009).  In deciding such a \nmotion, the court must accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint \nbut not its legal conclusions.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79.  The court must \nalso draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor and may \nconsider documents attached to the complaint, incorporated by reference \ninto the complaint, or known to and relied on by the plaintiff in bringing \nthe suit.  ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund. Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d \nCir. 2007).  The court may also consider documents that are integral to a \nplaintiff’s claims if the plaintiff would have had actual notice of the \ndocuments at the time the complaint was drafted. Cortec Indus., Inc. v. \nSum Holding L.P., 949 F.2d 42, 48 (2d Cir. 1991). \nThe legal standards relating to the constitutional and statutory \nprovisions relied on are well known and need no reiteration here. \nDealing with the complaint in this case, it is a close question as to \nwhether it states a valid cause of action for violation of constitutional \nrights.  Plaintiffs allege that they were confined behind barricades on a \nstreet for almost two hours.  However, the police were carrying out their \nduty to protect the President of the United States, who was visiting the \nhotel outside of which plaintiffs were protesting.  It is well known that \nextraordinary steps are taken to protect the President. \n  - 4 - \n\nPlaintiffs claim that the police went too far and sUbjected plaintiffs \nto a confinement beyond that which was necessary to protect the \nPresident.  The police obviously take the other view. \nThe court believes that it is not appropriate at this stage to rule on \nthe merits of the case.  Thus, the court declines to dismiss the action. \nHowever, a summary judgment motion, or cross-summary \njudgment motions, may be appropriate in order to avoid a drawn-out \nlitigation with full discovery and trial.  The court will confer with counsel. \nConclusion \nThe motion to dismiss is denied. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  New York, New York \nNovember 21,2013 \nThomas P.

GORENSTEIN, United States Magistrate Judge\nOn August 10, 2016, the district court issued an opinion granting in part and denying in\npart a motion for summary judgment by defendants.  The plaintiffs now move for\nreconsideration of that opinion to the extent it dismissed their purported claim under Monell v.\nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).1  For the reasons stated below, the\nplaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration should be denied.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nAs expressed by District Judge Thomas P. Griesa in his August 10, 2016, opinion, this\naction arose\nout of an Occupy Wall Street protest during President Barack Obama’s November\n2011 visit to New York City. Plaintiffs were protestors who were allegedly\ndeprived of their federal and state constitutional rights when New York Police\nDepartment (“NYPD”) officers detained them in a barricaded area for over an\nhour.\n1  See Notice of Motion, filed Sept. 10, 2018 (Docket # 138); Memorandum of Law in\nSupport of Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration, filed Sept. 10, 2018 (Docket # 139) (“Pl.\nMem.”); Declaration of David B. Rankin, filed Sept. 10, 2018 (Docket # 140); Memorandum of\nLaw in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration, filed Oct. 12, 2018 (Docket # 141)\n(“Def. Mem.”); Reply in Support of Motion to Reargue, filed Oct. 22, 2018 (Docket # 142) (“Pl.\nReply”).\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 2 of 12\nBerg v. New York City Police Comm’r Raymond Kelly, 2016 WL 4257525, at *1 (S.D.N.Y.\nAug. 10, 2016).\nFollowing the filing of plaintiffs’ original complaint, see Class Action Complaint, filed\nApr. 30, 2012 (Docket # 1), there was a lengthy discovery period, which included four orders\ngranting extensions of the discovery deadlines.  See Docket ## 74, 76, 78, minute entry dated\nSept. 28, 2015.  Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint following the close of discovery.  See\nClass Action Amended Complaint, filed Dec. 18, 2015 (Docket # 86) (“Am. Compl.”).  As was\ntrue of the original complaint, the Amended Complaint named a number of NYPD employees as\ndefendants, including Raymond Kelly, then Commissioner of the NYPD, and Joseph Esposito,\nthen Chief of Department of the NYPD.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 15-16.  Defendants then moved for\nsummary judgment as to all of plaintiffs’ claims.  See Docket ## 99-102.\nNeither the original Complaint nor the Amended Complaint named the City of New York\nas a defendant.  When defendants moved for summary judgment, they did not raise the issue of\nwhether the case could proceed on a claim under the doctrine of Monell v. Department of Social\nServices, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), which provides for the liability of municipalities for claims made\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  See Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion for\nSummary Judgment, filed Jan. 21, 2016 (Docket # 101).  In their opposition to the defendants’\nmotion, and in connection with defendants’ efforts to dismiss Kelly and Esposito for lack of\npersonal involvement in the claimed constitutional violations, plaintiffs argued that Kelly and\nEsposito were liable under Monell because the Amended Complaint stated they were sued in\ntheir “official” capacities and because evidence in the case showed a “policy or practice of\nfreezing the whole area while the President was in a building.”  Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law\nin Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, filed Mar. 11, 2016 (Docket\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 3 of 12\n# 108), at 17.  In their reply memorandum, defendants argued that this was an  “unpled\nmunicipal liability theory.”  Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants’ Motion for\nSummary Judgment, filed Mar. 24, 2016 (Docket # 114), at 8.  They argued that because\nplaintiffs “chose to omit such a theory from their complaint they should not be permitted to offer\na surprise Monell theory at this time.”  Id.\nIn ruling on the summary judgment motion, Judge Griesa noted that plaintiffs’ “amended\ncomplaint barely mentions either defendant” — referring to Kelly and Esposito.  Berg, 2016 WL\n4257525, at *3.  Judge Griesa then noted that “[i]n their opposition brief, plaintiffs belatedly\nraise [a theory] of supervisory liability under Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S.\n658 (1978).”  Id.  He ruled, however, that plaintiffs had “failed to plead [this] theory even after\namending their complaint.”  Id.\nAs to the remaining claims, Judge Griesa granted the defendants’ motion as to plaintiffs’ \nstate constitutional claims but denied the motion as to the federal constitutional claims, except\nthat he dismissed the claims as to Kelly and Esposito for lack of personal involvement.  Id. at *7. \nFinally, Judge Griesa held that the defendant officers “failed to show that they are entitled to\nqualified immunity.”  Id.\nThe defendants filed a notice of appeal challenging the denial of qualified immunity. \nThe parties then jointly asked Judge Griesa to extend the time to file any motion for\nreconsideration of his summary judgment ruling until after the disposition of the appeal.  See\nJoint Letter Motion, filed Sept. 12, 2016 (Docket # 121).  Judge Griesa approved this request. \nSee Order, filed Sept. 21, 2016 (Docket # 122).\nThe Second Circuit’s decision discussed plaintiffs’ constitutional claims at length and\nconcluded that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on these claims. See Berg v.\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 4 of 12\nKelly, 897 F.3d 99, 103 (2d Cir. 2018).  The opinion concluded as follows: “The decision of the\ndistrict court denying the Officers qualified immunity is reversed. The case is remanded with\ninstructions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.”  Id. at 114. \n  Under the “mandate rule,” which “is a branch of the law-of-the-case doctrine[,] . . . \nwhere issues have been explicitly or implicitly decided on appeal, the district court is obliged, on\nremand, to follow the decision of the appellate court.”  Burrell v. United States, 467 F.3d 160,\n165 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); accord United States v. Ben\nZvi, 242 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir. 2001); United States v. Minicone, 994 F.2d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 1993). \n“In other words, the trial court is barred from reconsidering or modifying any of its prior\ndecisions that have been ruled on by the court of appeals.”  Burrell, 467 F.3d at 165 (citing\nMinicone, 994 F.2d at 89 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).  While the Second\nCircuit’s decision instructed this Court to “dismiss the complaint with prejudice,” the decision\nalso included the following in a footnote:  \n[t]he district court dismissed the protesters’ claims against Raymond Kelly,\nCommissioner of the N.Y.P.D., and Joseph Esposito, Chief of Department of the\nN.Y.P.D. Because the protesters’ complaint barely mentioned these defendants,\nand neither was present at the protest, the district court concluded the protesters’\nclaims against these officers failed as a matter of law. It also dismissed the\nprotesters’ state law claims as duplicative of its federal claims. Neither of these\nrulings are at issue on this appeal.\nId. at 104 n.5 (emphasis added).  In light of this more specific statement, we construe the Second\nCircuit’s instruction to dismiss as limited to the claims in the complaint raising any federal\nconstitutional claims.\nThe Second Circuit’s mandate issued on August 15, 2018.  See Docket # 137.  On\nSeptember 10, 2018, plaintiffs filed their motion seeking reconsideration of the district court’s\ndismissal of the claims as to defendants Kelly and Esposito.  See Docket # 138; Pl. Mem. at 1.\n4\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 5 of 12\nII.  LAW GOVERNING MOTIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION\nMotions for reconsideration are governed by Local Civil Rule 6.3, which provides that\nthe moving party shall set forth “the matters or controlling decisions which counsel believes the\nCourt has overlooked.”  Thus, a motion to reconsider is generally denied “unless the moving\nparty can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked — matters, in other\nwords, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.”  Shrader\nv. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995).  The decision to grant or deny a motion\nfor reconsideration is “committed to the sound discretion of the district court.”  Wilder v. News\nCorp., 2016 WL 5231819, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted); accord Shrader, 70 F.3d at 257.  “The standard for granting a motion for\nreconsideration is strict,” RCC Ventures, LLC v. Brandtone Holdings Ltd., 322 F.R.D. 442, 445\n(S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citation omitted), and therefore such a motion “is not a vehicle for relitigating\nold issues, presenting the case under new theories, securing a rehearing on the merits, or\notherwise taking a second bite at the apple,” Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P.,\n684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); accord Ortega v.\nMutt, 2017 WL 1968296, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2017) (“Reconsideration of a previous order\nby the Court is an extraordinary remedy to be employed sparingly.”) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).   The Second Circuit has held that “[a] motion for reconsideration should\nbe granted only when the [moving party] identifies an intervening change of controlling law, the\navailability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.” \nKolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.\n2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nFurther, a party is “barred from making for the first time in a motion for reconsideration\n5\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 6 of 12\nan argument it could readily have raised when the underlying issue was being briefed but chose\nnot to do so.”  City of Austin Police Ret. Sys. v. Kinross Gold Corp., 957 F. Supp. 2d 277, 315\n(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In other words, “‘a party may\nnot advance new facts, issues or arguments not previously presented to the Court’ on a motion\nfor reconsideration.”  Steinberg v. Elkman, 2016 WL 1604764, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2016)\n(quoting Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Stroh Cos., 265 F.3d 97, 115 (2d Cir. 2001));\naccord Sigmon v. Goldman Sachs Mortg. Co., 229 F. Supp. 3d 254, 257 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).\nAdditionally, the “reconsideration rule” must be “narrowly construed and strictly applied\nso as to avoid duplicative rulings on previously considered issues.”  Merced Irrigation Dist. v.\nBarclays Bank PLC, 178 F. Supp. 3d 181, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (internal citation and quotation\nmarks omitted).  A narrow application of the rule not only “helps ‘to ensure the finality of\ndecisions,’” but also “‘prevent[s] the practice of a losing party examining a decision and then\nplugging the gaps of a lost motion with additional matters.’”  Henderson v. Metro. Bank & Tr.\nCo., 502 F. Supp. 2d 372, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Naiman v. N.Y. Univ. Hosps. Ctr., 2005\nWL 926904, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 2005)); see also Hernandez v. Loans, 2016 WL 6561415,\nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2016) (a reconsideration motion “should be denied where the moving\nparty merely seeks to relitigate an issue that was previously decided”) (citing Shrader, 70 F.3d at\n257). \nIII.  DISCUSSION\nPlaintiffs do not argue that there has been  an “intervening change of controlling law” or\nthat there is now “the availability of new evidence” as provided in Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of\nTartikov, 729 F.3d at 104.  Instead, they argue that the dismissal “must be reconsidered in the\ninterest of correcting error and preventing manifest injustice.”  Pl. Mem. at 2; see Kolel Beth\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 7 of 12\nYechiel Mechil of Tartikov, 729 F.3d at 104.  Plaintiffs’ argument, however, fails to show that\nJudge Griesa erred, let alone clearly erred, when he determined that the plaintiffs had “failed to\nplead [a Monell] theory even after amending their complaint.”  Berg, 2016 WL 4257525, at *3.\nPlaintiffs’ first argument is to point to case law recognizing that “a suit against an official\nin his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official personally but is a suit against the\nentity that the official represents.”  Pl. Mem. at 3 (citing Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 159\n(1985)).  That proposition, however, is not contested by defendants and is entirely consistent\nwith Judge Griesa’s ruling.  What plaintiffs fail to do is show that their complaint in fact pleaded\na claim for Monell liability and thus that Judge Griesa committed “clear error” in holding\notherwise.\nUnder Monell, municipalities may be treated as “persons” for the purpose of § 1983\nclaims “where . . . the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a\npolicy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by [the\nmunicipality’s] officers.”  436 U.S. at 690; accord Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361\nF.3d 113, 124-25 (2d Cir. 2004).  Thus, to prevail on a Monell claim, a plaintiff must show “(1)\nactions taken under color of law; (2) deprivation of a constitutional or statutory right; (3)\ncausation; (4) damages; and (5) that an official policy of the municipality caused the\nconstitutional injury.”  Roe v. City of Waterbury, 542 F.3d 31, 36 (2d Cir. 2008).2\n2  To establish the existence of a policy, the plaintiff must allege one of the following:\n(1) a formal policy which is officially endorsed by the municipality; (2) actions\ntaken or decisions made by government officials responsible for establishing\nmunicipal policies which caused the alleged violation of the plaintiff’s civil\nrights; (3) a practice so persistent and widespread that it constitutes a “custom or\nusage” and implies the constructive knowledge of policy-making officials; or (4)\na failure by official policy-makers to properly train or supervise subordinates to\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 8 of 12\nA municipality cannot be held liable on the basis of respondeat superior.  Monell, 436\nU.S. at 693-94; accord Roe, 542 F.3d at 36; Plair v. City of New York, 789 F. Supp. 2d 459, 468\n(S.D.N.Y. 2011).  Rather, the plaintiff must “demonstrate that, through its deliberate conduct, the\nmunicipality was the ‘moving force’ behind the injury alleged.”  Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v.\nBrown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997).  Thus, “[p]roof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity\nis not sufficient to impose liability under Monell, unless proof of the incident includes proof that\nit was caused by an existing, unconstitutional municipal policy, which policy can be attributed to\na municipal policymaker.”  City of Okla. City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823–24 (1985); accord\nPlair, 789 F. Supp. 2d at 470 (“[I]t is well established that a single incident does not give rise to\nan unlawful practice by subordinate officials so permanent and well-settled as to constitute\ncustom or usage.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (citing cases).\nHere, there is nothing in the Amended Complaint suggesting that plaintiffs were making\na claim under Monell.  Plaintiffs never contended the City of New York had an “official policy”\nthat “caused the constitutional injury.”  Roe, 542 F.3d at 36.  Instead, the complaint recites in\ndetail a single incident of alleged unconstitutional conduct occurring on November 30, 2011, on\nWest 53rd Street in Manhattan, when the plaintiffs were detained and kept inside a “pen” set up\nfor the press for approximately two hours.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28-42, 51, 60.  The Amended\nComplaint does not describe an official policy that resulted in the decision to keep plaintiffs in\nthis pen.  To the contrary, it alleges that the defendants’ conduct “violated” the NYPD’s official\nsuch an extent that it “amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of those\nwith whom municipal employees will come into contact.”\nJones v. Westchester Cnty. Dep’t of Corr. Med. Dep’t, 557 F. Supp. 2d 408, 417 (S.D.N.Y.\n2008) (quoting and citing Moray v. City of Yonkers, 924 F. Supp. 8, 12 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)).\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 9 of 12\npolicy of allowing attendees at demonstrations to “leave and return.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 3 (quoting\nStipulation of Settlement and Order, Stauber v. City of New York, 03 Civ. 9162, filed March 31,\n2008 (Docket # 14) (Sweet, J.) (“Stauber Settlement and Order”)); accord id. ¶¶ 86, 91, 96, 101. \nThis is precisely the sort of “single incident” of unconstitutional conduct that cannot support a\nMonell claim.  Indeed, the only allegations in the Amended Complaint that plaintiffs assert\nsupport their argument that it raises a Monell claim, see Pl. Reply at 1, are allegations of how the\nCity policy that was allegedly violated by the defendant officers came into effect, see Am.\nCompl. ¶¶ 23-27 (citing and quoting Stauber Settlement and Order) — not allegations that there\nwas a policy that was a “moving force” in causing plaintiffs to be kept in the pen.\nIn light of the complete absence of any allegation that the City of New York — or\ndefendants Kelly and Esposito in their official capacities — had a policy that caused plaintiffs to\nbe confined on November 30, 2011, plaintiffs did not plead a Monell claim.  Far from\ncommitting “clear error,” Judge Griesa properly characterized the Amended Complaint as not\nincluding such a claim.\nPlaintiffs argue that “the pleadings are not the relevant inquiry in a summary judgment\nmotion” and cite cases to support this proposition.  See Pl. Reply at 2.  But this statement sweeps\nfar too broadly.  While, in the typical case, a court does not examine whether pleadings are\nsufficient when considering a summary judgment motion because of the possibility that an\namendment to the pleadings would cure any defect, the situation is completely different where,\nas here, neither the original complaint — which suffers from the same defects as the Amended\nComplaint —  nor any other events during the course of discovery gave notice that the claim\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 10 of 12\nsought to be added was being made.3  Other than pointing to the fact that their complaints stated\nthat Kelly and Esposito were being sued in their “official” capacities, plaintiffs provide no\nargument that defendants were on notice that plaintiffs were making a Monell claim.  \nPlaintiffs assert that “[t]he issue before the Court is the sufficiency of the proof.”  Pl.\nReply. at 2.   In fact, that is not the issue.  Rather, the issue is whether Judge Griesa’s conclusion\nthat plaintiffs had never “pled” the Monell claim should be reconsidered.  See Berg, 2016 WL\n4257525, at *3.  Even if we look to the “proof” plaintiffs point to, it plainly failed to give notice\nto defendants that plaintiffs were pursuing a Monell claim.  Plaintiffs point to the deposition of\nan Inspector Hart, a non-party police official, who briefly testified that the NYPD’s actions on\nthe day of the incident were proper.  See Pl. Mem. at 6-7.  But given that the Amended\nComplaint explicitly alleged that the police officers’ actions that day “violated” a governing\npolicy that would have allowed plaintiffs to leave the pen, see Am. Compl. ¶ 3, Inspector Hart’s\ntestimony could not possibly have given defendants notice that plaintiffs sought to hold the City\nliable for instituting a policy that led to the alleged constitutional violations.  Moreover,\ndefendants have stated without contradiction that plaintiffs took no discovery addressing Monell\nliability.  See Def. Mem. at 5.  Under these circumstances, Judge Griesa properly rejected\n3  Thus in Caputo v. Pfizer, Inc., 267 F.3d 181 (2d Cir. 2001), one of the cases cited by\nplaintiffs, the Second Circuit found that a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) need not be\nconsidered at the summary judgment stage where, by the time of the summary judgment motion\nthe defendant “had all of the particulars,” id. at 191 n.4, which presumably had been obtained\nthrough discovery.  The Court also noted that the “policies behind Rule 9(b)” — obviously\nreferring to the notice that pleading fraud with particularity gives defendants  — were not served\nby defendants’ efforts to raise the Rule 9(b) pleading requirements at the summary judgment\nstage.  See id.  Here, by contrast, there were no indication that plaintiffs were pursuing a Monell\nclaim.  \n10\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 11 of 12\nplaintiffs’ belated effort to assert a Monell claim.4\nJudge Griesa having committed no “clear error,” and plaintiffs having provided no reason\nwhy requiring adherence to standard rules of pleading would work a “manifest injustice,” the\nsummary judgment decision should not be reconsidered.\nIV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration (Docket # 138) should\nbe denied.\nPROCEDURE FOR FILING OBJECTIONS TO THIS\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the parties have fourteen (14) days (including weekends and holidays) from service\nof this Report and Recommendation to file any objections.  See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a), (b), (d). \nA party may respond to any objections within 14 days after being served.  Any objections and\nresponses shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court, with copies sent to the Hon. Lewis A.\nKaplan at 500 Pearl Street, New York, New York 10007.  Any request for an extension of time\nto file objections or responses must be directed to Judge Kaplan.  If a party fails to file timely\nobjections, that party will not be permitted to raise any objections to this Report and\nRecommendation on appeal.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72; Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a),\n6(b), 6(d); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140 (1985); Wagner & Wagner, LLP v. Atkinson, Haskins,\nNellis, Brittingham, Gladd & Carwile, P.C., 596 F.3d 84, 92 (2d Cir. 2010).\n4  While plaintiffs do not seek to amend their complaint to include a Monell claim, any\nsuch motion if made now would have to be denied because of plaintiffs’ undue delay in making\nthe motion and the prejudice that would result from allowing the amendment in light of the late\nstage of this case and the length of time that has passed since the original incident.  See generally\nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-LAK-GWG   Document 144   Filed 11/30/18   Page 12 of 12\nDated: November 30, 2018 \nNew York, New York \n12 ",

The protesters claim that this detention\nviolated their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Concluding that the\nOfficers' motivation for the detention was a material fact in dispute and that a finding\nas to the Officers' motivation affected the determination of the objective\nreasonableness of the Officers actions, the district court denied the Officers summary\njudgment on the protesters' First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims, and\ndenied the Officers qualified immunity. The Officers appealed. This court denied the\nprotesters' motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The\nOfficers argue before us that the limited detention that occurred was permissible under\nthe special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment so as not to violate the protesters\nconstitutional rights and, in any event, they are entitled to qualified immunity. We\nidentify disputes of fact that do not permit a court to conclude as a matter of law that\nthe protesters' twohour detention was permissible under the special needs exception to\nthe Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. We nonetheless conclude that the\nofficers are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court erred in concluding that\nthe Officers' subjective intent in temporarily detaining the protesters was relevant to\nwhether the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Considered objectively, we\nconclude that, at the time of the challenged actions, reasonable officers could have\nbelieved that the approximately twohour detention of the protesters in response to\nconcerns for the President's security was justified in light of then established law.\nBecause the Officers could have reasonably believed the temporary detention was\nlawful, they are also entitled to qualified immunity on the OWS protesters' First\nAmendment and Fourteenth Amendment claims.

In this civil rights class action against police officers of the New York City Police \nDepartment (the “NYPD”), Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter, individually and on behalf \nof a class of all others similarly situated, seek damages and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 to redress violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution and the constitution of the State of New York.  \n2.  These violations occurred when, on November 30, 2011, Plaintiffs sought to \ndemonstrate in affiliation with the Occupy Wall Street (“OWS”) movement and the NYPD \nwithout any reason or cause detained them for nearly two hours inside an interlocking metal \nbarricade.  The  NYPD  prohibited  Plaintiffs  from  exiting  the  pen  because  they  were  OWS \ndemonstrators, while permitting tourists and journalists to leave. Plaintiffs, numbering between \n70 and 120 people, were never charged with any violation, misdemeanor, or crime.   \n3.  The NYPD’s actions violated a provision of the NYPD Patrol Guide mandated by \norder of the Honorable Robert Sweet, United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nNew York, in Stauber v. City of New York, 03 Civ. 9163, dated March 31, 2008 (annexed to this \nComplaint as Exhibit 1), which states: \nBarrier configuration for demonstrations should not unreasonably \nrestrict  access  to  and  participation  in  the  event.  For  example, \nattendees should be permitted to leave a barricaded area at any \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 3 of 25\n\t\r  \ntime.  In  addition,  if  crowd  conditions  and  other  circumstances \npermit, participants should be permitted to leave and return to the \nsame  area.  Sufficient  openings  in  the  barricades  should  be \nmaintained  for  purpose  of  permitted  attendees  to  leave \nexpeditiously  and  return  to  the  event  as  described  in  this \nparagraph. \n \n4.  Defendants  violated  Plaintiffs’  clear  and  established  constitutional  rights, \nincluding their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, and \nfreedom from unreasonable seizure.  \n5.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter are New Yorkers who have voiced their \nsupport  for  change  in  the  past  and  who  have  plans  to  demonstrate  in  New  York  City  in \nassociation with OWS in the coming months. As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions \nunder the color of state law and in the scope of their employment with the NYPD, including their \nviolation of an express court order, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights have been chilled and \nthere is a real and immediate threat that their constitutional rights will be violated by the NYPD \nagain. \n6.  By this action, Plaintiffs seek redress for the violations of their constitutional and \ncivil rights and to recover damages they suffered as a result of this incident. Plaintiffs further \nseek an order enjoining the NYPD from unlawful use of barricades and compelling the NYPD to \ncomply with court orders restricting the use of pens.    \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343 (3-4). \n8.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 for violations of \nPlaintiffs’  rights  under  the  First,  Fourth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  of  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 4 of 25\n\t\r  \n9.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) in that Plaintiffs’ claims arose in \nthe Southern District of New York. \nPARTIES \n \nNamed Plaintiffs \n \n10.

At all times relevant herein, Defendants violated clearly established constitutional \nstandards under First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of which a reasonable police officer \nand/or public official under their respective circumstances would have known.  \n43.  Defendants’  acts  hereafter  complained  of  were  carried  out  intentionally, \nrecklessly, with malice and/or gross disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n44.  On March 31, 2008, the Honorable Robert Sweet, United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of New York, so-ordered a stipulation entered into and agreed to by the \nCity of New York (the “City”) in the case captioned Ann Stauber and the New York Civil \nLiberties Union v. the City of New York, et al., 03 Civ. 9162 (the “Stauber Settlement and \nOrder”) (Ex. A hereto). \n45.  The Stauber Settlement and Order arose from actions brought against the City, \namong others, asserting, inter alia, that the NYPD’s policy and/or practice of using interlocking \nmetal barricades, or “pens,” to confine demonstrators in fixed locations violated the Constitution. \n46.  In the Stauber Settlement and Order, the City agreed to insert in the NYPD Patrol \nGuide the following: \nNote:  In  cases  in  which  the  special  event  is  a  demonstration, \ninformation  on  expected  street  and  sidewalk  closings  and \ninformation on how the public may access a demonstration site \nwill be disseminated to the media and to event organizers and \nshould,  if  possible,  be  posted  on  the  Department’s  website. \nOfficers  assigned  to  such  events  should  be  given  detailed \ninstructions  on  such  closings  and  points  of  access  prior  to \nassignment. Detail supervisors should also be advised of street \nclosures and points of access and any changes of points of access \nwhich  occur  during  the  event  and  which  were  not  previously \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 10 of 25\n\t\r  \nanticipated and publicized. Officers assigned to such events shall \nprovide information to the public at the event about a available \npoints of access. \n \n47.  In the Stauber Settlement and Order, the City agreed to insert in the NYPD Patrol \nGuide the following: \nBarrier  configuration  for  demonstrations  should  not \nunreasonably  restrict  access  to  and  participation  in  the \nevent. For example, attendees should be permitted to leave \na  barricaded  area  at  any  time.  In  addition,  if  crowd \nconditions  and  other  circumstances  permit,  participants \nshould be permitted to leave and return to the same area. \nSufficient openings in the barricades should be maintained \nfor purpose of permitted attendees to leave expeditiously \nand return to the event as described in this paragraph. \n \n48.  Commissioner Kelly was a party to the Stauber Settlement and Order.  \n \nA Demonstration for the President, November 30, 2011 \n49.  Upon information and belief, on November 30, 2011, President Barak Obama \nattended a fundraiser dinner at the Sheraton Hotel (the “Hotel”) in New York, New York. \n50.  At  approximately  8:00  p.m.,  about  100  people  affiliated  with  OWS  events, \nincluding Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter, sought to demonstrate in front of the Hotel \nwhile the President arrived for the fundraiser dinner.  \n51.  Plaintiffs sought to demonstrate near the President and the media covering the \nPresident’s event at the Hotel. \n52.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, Jetter, and others walked to the Hotel in a group. \n53.  Plaintiffs carried signs with the intention of sharing messages with the President \nand the media covering the President’s event. Kida carried a sign that said, “Get money out of \npolitics.” Berg carried a sign protesting the National Defense Authorization Act. \n54.  The Hotel is located on the eastern side of Seventh Avenue between 52nd and 53rd \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 11 of 25\n\t\r  \nStreets.  \n55.  When Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter attempted to approach the Hotel, \nthey found that the NYPD had erected a barricade with interlocking metal fences approximately \nthree-feet tall on Seventh Avenue, across the street from the Hotel at the southwest corner of 53rd \nStreet.  \n56.  The barricade created a “U” shape that extended west on 53rd Street toward \nBroadway for approximately 100 feet, such that there was an opening into and out of the \nbarricade area on 53rd street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway.  \n57.   The barricades that made up the “U” were locked when Berg, Kida, Rivera, \nRozental and Jetter arrived.  \n58.  Defendants told Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter in sum or substance that \nthe only place they could stand was inside this locked “U” configuration of barricades. \n59.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, Jetter and others moved into the center of the “U”-\nshaped configuration and waited for the President to arrive.  \n60.   Because  of  the  configuration  of  the  barricade,  it  was  not  possible  for  the \ndemonstrators to get any closer to the Hotel entrance or the media covering the President’s visit.  \n61.  Sanitation trucks blocked the view from the Hotel entrance to the barricaded area.  \n62.  At approximately 8:30 p.m., Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter moved into \nthe NYPD barricades toward the east side, i.e., closer to the Hotel, in order to be as close as \npossible to the President when he arrived. \n63.  At approximately 8:41 p.m., Defendants brought barricades from further west on \n53rd Street and closed the opening of the barricaded area, turning the “U” shaped barricade into a \nrectangular confined area or pen. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 12 of 25\n\t\r  \n64.  Upon information and belief, pursuant to customary practice, Chief Esposito’s \noffice would have to receive notice of and give consent for the closing of the pen.  \n65.  Defendants told Plaintiffs in sum or substance that they were not permitted to exit \nthe pen.  \n66.  One Defendant, in sum and substance, told Jetter that he was not free to leave and \nthat he would be arrested if he attempted to leave the pen. Upon information and belief, other \nPlaintiffs were told the same. \n67.  Defendants prevented the Plaintiffs from exiting the pen. \n68.  For example, Rivera, Jetter and others attempted to leave the pen at 9:15 p.m.  \nafter learning that the President had arrived and entered the Hotel, but were prohibited from \ndoing so by Defendants.  \n69.  Plaintiffs were held in the pen for nearly two hours. \n70.  During that time, Plaintiffs who sought to leave the pen were prohibited from \ndoing so by Defendants.  \n71.  Defendants prohibited Plaintiffs from exiting the pen for any reason. \n72.  Defendants prohibited Plaintiffs from exiting the pen to use the restroom or to get \nfood.  \n73.  Plaintiffs who became ill were only able to leave the pen when taken by an \nambulance. \n74.  For example, one demonstrator, Lisa Rubenstein, who felt ill inside the pen, was \ntaken away by ambulance only after fainting inside the closed pen. \n75.   Jetter, who was feeling too sick to remain at the demonstration, was forced to \nstay despite a fever.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 13 of 25\n\t\r  \n76.  During the time that Plaintiffs were trapped in the pen, traffic was moving freely \non Seventh Avenue. \n77.  During the time that Plaintiffs were trapped in the pen, pedestrians were moving \nfreely on Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street, on the north and east corners of the intersection.  \n78.  At approximately 10:26 p.m., nearly two hours after the pen was initially closed \noff  and  nearly  two  hours  after  Plaintiffs  were  trapped  by  Defendants  inside  the  pen,  the \nbarricades were removed from the west side of the pen. \n79.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs were treated differently than others at the \nsame intersection at the same time.  \n80.  Defendants told Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter in sum or substance that \nthey were being held because they were protestors.  \n81.  Upon information and belief, tourists who were trapped in the pen were permitted \nto exit the pen while demonstrators were held. \n82.  Upon information and belief, journalists were permitted to exit the pen while \ndemonstrators were held. For example, upon information and belief, Josh Robin from NY 1 was \nreleased from the pen at 9:10 p.m., upon his request.  \n83.  Upon information and belief, legal observers and members of the press were \nunable to enter the pen and access Plaintiffs. For example: legal observer Tamara Bedic could \nnot get any closer to the demonstrators than the corner of Broadway and 53rd Streets; journalists \nJosh Harkinson (Mother Jones), Meg Robertson (MSNBC) and Andrew Katz (Brooklyn Ink), \nwere not allowed to approach the pen on foot from the West; when Mr. Harkinson and Mr. Katz \nwere later able to approach by taking a cab south on 7th Avenue, they were escorted away from \nthe area when they began talking to demonstrators in the pen.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 14 of 25\n\t\r  \n84.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental and Jetter were not charged with any violation, \nmisdemeanor or crime. \n85.  Upon  information  and  belief,  none  of  the  Plaintiffs  was  charged  with  any \nviolation, misdemeanor, or crime. \n86.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs were held in the pen because of their \naffiliation with the OWS movement. \n87.  Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter are active in the OWS movement and \nhave plans to attend demonstrations affiliated with OWS in New York City the next few months.  \n88.  Plaintiffs have avoided demonstrations after the November 30, 2011, incident for \nfear  of  becoming  trapped  in  an  NYPD  erected  pen.  For  example,  Berg  did  not  attend  a \ndemonstration  she  would  have  otherwise  attended  at  another  presidential  fundraiser,  and \nabandoned demonstrations where NYPD appeared with barricade fences, due to fear of being \ntrapped in such a pen again. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n89.  Pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Berg, \nKida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter seek to represent persons who were detained in the pen erected \nby the NYPD at Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street on the evening of November 30, 2011.  \n90.  The  members  of  the  class,  believed  to  number  between  70  and  120,  are  so \nnumerous as to render joinder impracticable. Berg, Kida, Rivera, Rozental, and Jetter currently \nhave information identifying at least 47 class members. \n91.  In addition, joinder is impracticable because many members of the class live \noutside of New York State and some live outside of the United States. Moreover, many class \nmembers who have been victimized by the defendants’ unconstitutional policies and practices \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 15 of 25\n\t\r  \nmay not bring individual claims. There is no adequate avenue for the protection of the class \nmembers’ constitutional rights other than a class action.  \n92.  The class members share a number of questions of law and fact in common, \nincluding but not limited to the following: \ni.  Whether interlocking barricades were erected and maintained on the evening \nof November 30, 2011 in a manner that amounted to an unlawful seizure in \ncontravention of the Fourth Amendment. \nii.  Whether interlocking barricades were erected and maintained on the evening \nof November 30, 2011 in a way that constituted an unreasonable restriction on \nspeech in contravention of the First Amendment. \niii.  Whether the NYPD targeted the Plaintiffs on November 30, 2011, because of \ntheir perceived association with OWS in violation of the equal protection \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n93.  These common questions of fact and law all flow from the same policies, enacted \nby the same defendants, and implemented by the same named and unnamed defendants.  \n94.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of those of the class in that, inter \nalia, at the time their constitutional rights were violated, they were engaging and attempting to \nengage in activities protected by the First Amendment and they were treated by the NYPD in the \nsame manner as members of the class, resulting in violations of their First, Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights under the United States Constitution.  \n95.  The named plaintiffs have a strong personal interest in the outcome of this action, \nhave no conflicts of interest with members of the plaintiff class, and will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class. Moreover, the named plaintiffs reside in the New York area and \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 16 of 25\n\t\r  \nintend to continue to participate in demonstrations in New York City, where the defendants’ \nunconstitutional policies, practices and customs are implemented, and therefore remain at high \nrisk of being unconstitutionally harmed in the future pursuant to these policies, practices and \ncustoms.  \n96.  The named plaintiffs are represented by the undersigned counsel, civil rights \nlawyers with experience litigating a wide range of civil rights and class action lawsuits.  \ni.  RANKIN & TAYLOR PLLC has broad civil rights experience from litigating \nmatters in numerous contexts.  The firm handles a strong ongoing police \nmisconduct  docket  in  both  state  and  federal  court.  They  have  also  won \nsignificant victories in the employment context.  In addition to individual \nplaintiff  actions,  RANKIN  &  TAYLOR,  in  partnership  with  two  solo \npractitioners, handled a mass action of over 80 plaintiffs arrested during the \nNYPD's crackdown on Critical Mass bike rides, Callaghan v. City of New \nYork, 07-cv-9611, and has litigated several other multiple plaintiff matters \nover  public  assembly  issues,  property  confiscations,  and  wage  and  hour \nviolations.  The firm's eight attorneys represent significant experience and \nresources in handling complex actions.  \nii.  Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP, a New York law firm founded in 1964 with \nan extensive civil and criminal practice that has handled police misconduct \nand constitutional litigation for almost thirty years, has extensive experience \nlitigating  civil  rights  cases  and  class  action  lawsuits.  Representative  civil \nrights cases in which Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP has acted as class \ncounsel include: MacNamara, et al., v. the City of New York, 04 Civ. 09216 \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 17 of 25\n\t\r  \n(S.D.N.Y.) (RJS)(JCF) (challenging the arrest and detention of demonstrators \nat the 2004 Republican National Convention, recently granted class status); \nDaniels v. New York, 99 Civ. 1695 (S.D.N.Y.) (SAS) (challenging the City’s \npolicy and practice of suspicionless and race-based stops and frisks); Burley et \nal. v. City of New York, et al., 03 Civ. 735 (S.D.N.Y.) (Pauley, J.) (challenging \nexcessive detention of demonstrators arrested for minor offenses during the \n2002 World Economic Forum).  \n97.  Counsel  for  the  plaintiffs  have  the  resources,  expertise,  and  experience  to \nprosecute this action. Counsel for the plaintiffs know of no conflicts among members of the class \nor between the attorneys and members of the class.  \n98.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. The class is readily defined and prosecution of a class action \nwill eliminate the possibility of repetitious litigation, while also providing redress for claims \nwhich may not be large enough to warrant the expense of individual litigation.  \n99.  All named plaintiffs and class members were victimized by the same policies, \npractices,  customs  and/or  conduct  and  thus  common  questions  of  law  and  fact  greatly \npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, including legal and factual \nissues relating to damages. \n100.  The plaintiff class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) because \nquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting \nonly individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly \nand efficiently adjudicating the controversy. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-03391-TPG   Document 1    Filed 04/30/12   Page 18 of 25\n\t\r  \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nPURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nDEPRIVATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS  \nUNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n   \n101.

for the Southern District of New York \n12  No. 12‐cv‐3391 – Thomas P. Griesa, Judge. \n13 \n14 \n15  Before:  RAGGI, HALL, and CARNEY, Circuit Judges. \n16 \n17  Members of Occupy Wall Street (“OWS protesters” or “protesters”) \n18  assert that a group of New York City Police Officers (the “Officers”) unlaw‐\n19  fully detained them during a protest outside the Sheraton Hotel where Pres‐\n20  ident Obama was attending a fundraising dinner. The protesters claim that \n21  this  detention  violated  their  First,  Fourth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendment \n22  rights. Concluding that the Officers’ motivation for the detention was a ma‐\n23  terial fact in dispute and that a finding as to the Officers’ motivation affected \n24  the determination of the objective reasonableness of the Officers’ actions, the \n25  district court denied the Officers summary judgment on the protesters’ First, \n26  Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims, and denied the Officers quali‐\n27  fied immunity. The Officers appealed. This court denied the protesters’ mo‐\n28  tion to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Officers \n29  argue before us that the limited detention that occurred was permissible un‐\n30  der the special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment so as not to vio‐\n31  late the protesters’ constitutional rights and, in any event, they are entitled \n32  to qualified immunity. \n33 \n1 The Clerk of Court directed to amend the official caption in this case as set forth \nabove. \n2 \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P oafg 3e7 3 of 37\n \n1  We identify disputes of fact that do not permit a court to conclude as \n2  a matter of law that the protesters’ two‐hour detention was permissible un‐\n3  der the special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant re‐\n4  quirement. We nonetheless conclude that the officers are entitled to quali‐\n5  fied immunity. The district court erred in concluding that the Officers’ sub‐\n6  jective  intent  in  temporarily  detaining  the  protesters  was  relevant  to \n7  whether the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Considered objec‐\n8  tively, we conclude that, at the time of the challenged actions, reasonable \n9  officers could have believed that the approximately two‐hour detention of \n10  the protesters in response to concerns for the President’s security was justi‐\n11  fied in light of then established law. Because the Officers could have reason‐\n12  ably believed the temporary detention was lawful, they are also entitled to \n13  qualified immunity on the OWS protesters’ First Amendment and Four‐\n14  teenth Amendment claims.  \n15   \n16  REVERSED AND REMANDED. \n17   \n18   \n19  KATHY CHANG PARK, Assistant Corporation \n20  Counsel  (Richard  Dearing  and  Claude  S. \n21  Platton, on the brief), on behalf of Zachary W. \n22  Carter, Corporation Counsel of the City of \n23  New York, New York, New York, for Defend‐\n24  ants‐Appellants. \n25   \n26  DAVID B. RANKIN, Beldock Levine & Hoff‐\n27  man LLP, New York, New York, for Plain‐\n28  tiffs‐Appellees. \n29   \n30   \n31   \n32  HALL, Circuit Judge: \n33   \n34    This is an appeal from an order entered on August 10, 2016, in the \n35  Southern District of New York (Griesa, J.), denying summary judgment in \n3 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  4P oafg 3e7 4 of 37\n1  part to Defendants‐Appellants Police Officers (the “Officers”), who claimed \n2  qualified immunity from suit by Plaintiffs‐Appellees, participants in an Oc‐\n3  cupy Wall Street protest.2 The named protesters assert that the Officers un‐\n4  lawfully detained them and other putative class members during a protest \n5  outside the Sheraton Hotel where President Obama was attending a fund‐\n6  raising dinner on November 30, 2011. Before us on appeal are the protesters’ \n7  claims that this detention violated their Fourth Amendment rights, that the \n8  detention was in retaliation for their exercise of First Amendment rights, \n9  that they were subjected to selective enforcement in violation of the Four‐\n10  teenth Amendment, and that certain officers failed to intervene to protect \n11  their constitutional rights.3 The Officers argue that they are entitled to sum‐\n12  mary judgment based on qualified immunity because: (1) under the special \n13  needs exception to the Fourth Amendment, there was no constitutional vi‐\n14  olation; and (2) even if the detention that occurred were determined to be \n2 The Plaintiffs‐Appellees will be referred to as “OWS protesters” or “pro‐\ntesters.” \n3 The OWS protesters assert failure to intervene claims against Defendants \nJames McNamara, Peter Loehle, and Stephen Latalardo. McNamara was the officer in \ncommand in the area of the Sheraton. Loehle was the sector commander for the area en‐\ncompassing the Sheraton. And Latalardo admits he may have been the officer that actually \nclosed and opened the press pen where the OWS protesters was detained. \n4 \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  5P oafg 3e7 5 of 37\n \n1  unconstitutional, there was no clearly established law doing so at the time \n2  their actions were taken.  \n3    On the record before us, we conclude that the Officers have not \n4  demonstrated that, as a matter of law, the protesters’ two‐hour detention \n5  was justified under the “special needs” exception to the Fourth Amend‐\n6  ment’s warrant requirement. This is not to dismiss the possibility of addi‐\n7  tional evidence being introduced at a trial to support such a conclusion. But \n8  no such trial is warranted here because, as to the second argument, we con‐\n9  clude that the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity. At the time of the \n10  detentions at issue, it was not clearly established that the Fourth Amend‐\n11  ment did not permit officers protecting the President of the United States to \n12  detain protesters as occurred in this case. We further conclude that because \n13  the Officers have qualified immunity from the OWS protesters’ Fourth \n14  Amendment claims, they are also entitled to qualified immunity on the \n15  OWS protesters’ related First Amendment and failure to intervene claims. \n16  As to the OWS protesters’ Fourteenth Amendment claims for selective en‐\n17  forcement, the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity because reasona‐\n18  ble officers could disagree as to whether the plaintiffs’ status as protesters \n5 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  6P oafg 3e7 6 of 37\n \n1  presented unique concerns that non‐protesters on the scene did not. We pro‐\n2  ceed to explain these conclusions. \n3  I. \n4    On the night of November 30, 2011, the OWS protesters planned to \n5  protest a fundraising dinner for President Obama at the Sheraton Hotel in \n6  midtown Manhattan. Because part of the protesters’ message was aimed at \n7  keeping money out of politics, the point of that night’s protest was to bring \n8  attention to the President’s fundraiser. Through various social media ac‐\n9  counts, the OWS protesters had advertised the protest using hashtags such \n10  as #OccupyObama and #DinnerWithBarack.  \n11    The President’s visit occurred the same night as the annual Christmas \n12  tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, less than a quarter mile from the Shera‐\n13  ton. The New York City Police Department (“N.Y.P.D.”) had responded to \n14  a bomb threat at Rockefeller Center approximately one hour prior to Presi‐\n15  dent Obama’s arrival at the Sheraton.  \n16    The OWS protest began in Bryant Park, at 42nd Street and 6th Ave‐\n17  nue. The protesters intended to march about ten blocks northwest toward \n18  the Sheraton Hotel at 53rd Street and 7th Avenue to confront the President. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L

Street and 7th Avenue, in an area the N.Y.P.D. had previously designated \n3  as the “demonstration area.” The protesters, however, opted not to remain \n4  in the demonstration area, but continued to march toward the Sheraton, ul‐\n5  timately stopping at approximately 8:00 p.m., on the southwest corner of \n6  53rd  Street  and  7th Avenue.  The  protesters  stopped  there  because  the \n7  N.Y.P.D. had restricted pedestrian traffic any closer to the Sheraton. This \n8  landed the OWS protesters directly across the street from the hotel and \n9  within the President’s line of sight as he entered and exited. \n10  According to the N.Y.P.D. plans, the area near the southwest corner \n11  of 53rd Street and 7th Avenue was designated the “press pen.” Partially en‐\n12  closed by barriers on three sides, the press pen was reserved for individual \n13  press members holding certain security credentials. Although not members \n14  of the press, much less credentialed, OWS protesters chose to gather in the \n15  press  pen  because  it  was  closer  to  the  President  than  their  designated \n16  demonstration area at 51st Street and 7th Avenue. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  8P oafg 3e7 8 of 37\n \n1  Shortly before the President’s arrival at approximately 8:50 p.m., the \n2  N.Y.P.D. established a “frozen zone” for a period of time during which ve‐\n3  hicular and pedestrian traffic was restricted in the area surrounding the ho‐\n4  tel. The “frozen zone” extended from 6th Avenue to Broadway and from \n5  West 52nd Street to West 53rd Street. Dump trucks were also placed in front \n6  of the Sheraton to prevent cars from driving into the hotel and to protect \n7  against explosives. \n8  At some point, the Officers placed an additional barricade on the \n9  “press pen,” enclosing it on all four sides. It is unclear whether this closure \n10  occurred before or after the President’s arrival, and the Officers cannot iden‐\n11  tify who ordered the closure. After the last barricade was put in place, OWS \n12  protesters learned that they were not permitted to leave the area because the \n13  area had been ordered “frozen.” The Officers advised the protesters that \n14  they could expect to be released from the press pen once President Obama \n15  was safely inside the Sheraton. Subsequently, the Officers advised the pro‐\n16  testers that they would be released after President Obama left the vicinity. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e

the hotel, the Officers allowed traffic and pedestrians to flow freely on 7th \n5  Avenue. The OWS protesters, however, were required to remain in the press \n6  pen. Indeed, the Officers threatened to arrest any OWS protesters who tried \n7  to leave the press pen. Meanwhile, tourists and journalists in the press pen \n8  were allowed to leave. During the President’s time at the Sheraton, two pro‐\n9  testers in the press pen developed health issues, and the Officers offered to \n10  call for an ambulance. One of those protesters chose to stay; the other left by \n11  ambulance. Shortly after the President departed the hotel at 10:25 p.m., the \n12  protesters were permitted to leave the press pen. \n13    The OWS protesters filed this lawsuit asserting federal claims under \n14  42 U.S.C. § 1983 that the Officers had violated their First, Fourth, and Four‐\n15  teenth Amendment rights, both directly by detaining them and indirectly \n16  by failing to intervene to stop the constitutional violations. The protesters \n17  further asserted state law claims based on the same conduct. The Officers \n

The district court determined there was a dispute of material fact with \n5  respect to the Officers’ motive for fully enclosing the press pen. On the basis \n6  of that factual dispute, which the court determined precluded recognition \n7  of qualified immunity, it denied the Officers summary judgment on the \n8  OWS protesters’ federal claims. According to the district court, if the Offic‐\n9  ers had detained the protesters due to a motivation “more sinister” than \n10  “presidential security,” a proposition the court had to assume on summary \n11  judgment, then “clearly established law at the time of [the] detention could \n12  support” each of the OWS protesters’ § 1983 claims.   Berg et al. v. New York \n13  City Police Comm’r Raymond Kelly et al., No. 12‐cv‐3391 (TPG), 2016 WL \n14

The district court dismissed the protesters’ claims against Raymond Kelly, \nCommissioner of the N.Y.P.D., and Joseph Esposito, Chief of Department of the N.Y.P.D. \nBecause the protesters’ complaint barely mentioned these defendants, and neither was \npresent at the protest, the district court concluded the protesters’ claims against these of‐\nficers failed as a matter of law. It also dismissed the protesters’ state law claims as dupli‐\ncative of its federal claims. Neither of these rulings are at issue on this appeal. \n  \n10 \n

The Officers appealed from the district court’s ruling denying them \n2  qualified immunity. Before this Court the protesters moved to dismiss for \n3  lack of appellate jurisdiction. We denied the OWS protesters’ motion and \n4  concluded that we have jurisdiction over this appeal “to the extent that [the \n5  Officers] can support their defense on [the protesters’] ‘version of the facts \n6  that the district judge deemed available for jury resolution.’” Order, No. 16‐\n7  3146 (Jan 11, 2017) (quoting Lynch v. Ackley, 811 F.3d 569, 576 (2d Cir. 2016)). \n8  The gravamen of Appellant Officers’ argument is that the special \n9  needs exception applicable to the analysis of Fourth Amendment seizures, \n10  see Michigan Dep’t of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 449 – 50 (1990), justified \n11  their almost two‐hour‐long detention of the OWS protesters in the vicinity \n12  of where the President was attending a fundraising dinner. According to the \n13  Officers, the circumstances requiring them to focus their attention on the \n14  President’s security were a sufficient basis to except the detention of the pro‐\n15  testers from the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that their seizure be sup‐\n16  ported by probable cause, and in any event, it was reasonable for the Offic‐\n17  ers to believe that their actions were lawful given existing precedent. Appel‐\n18  lee OWS protesters, on the other hand, would have us ignore whether it was \n11 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  1P2a ogfe 3 172 of 37\n \n1  objectively reasonable for the Officers to believe, under the circumstances, \n2  that they were acting within the dictates of the law. Instead, the protesters \n3  want this Court to hold, regardless of the objective reasonableness of the \n4  Officers’ actions, that the Officers are not entitled to qualified immunity \n5  once we determine they violated a clearly established right. In so urging, \n6  Appellees argue that the Officers’ subjective intent in applying the special \n7  needs exception is in dispute, and thus the Officers are not entitled to qual‐\n8  ified immunity on summary judgment. The OWS protesters dispute, in any \n9  event, whether a special needs exception should apply in the context of what \n10  occurred in this case.  \n11  In the analysis that follows, we address first the question of jurisdic‐\n12  tion and conclude that we have jurisdiction to resolve the Officers’ appeal \n13  in the procedural posture presented. We then consider whether the Officers \n14  are entitled to summary judgment because there was no violation of the pro‐\n15  testers’  Fourth  Amendment  rights.  Because  that  conclusion  cannot  be \n16  reached as a matter of law on the present record, we proceed to consider \n17  whether the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity in any event because \n18  then‐existing law did not clearly establish the unconstitutionality of the \n12 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  1P3a ogfe 3 173 of 37\n \n1  challenged detentions. We conclude that the Officers do have qualified im‐\n2  munity from the protesters’ Fourth Amendment claims and that such im‐\n3  munity also bars the OWS protesters’ remaining claims under the First and \n4  Fourteenth Amendments.  \n5  III. \n6  We have appellate jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to \n7  hear an interlocutory appeal from the district court’s denial of qualified im‐\n8  munity. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985). Where, as here, denial \n9  of qualified immunity turns on questions of law, the court’s decision consti‐\n10  tutes a final appealable order under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 that we review de novo. \n11  Clubside, Inc. v. Valentin, 468 F.3d 144, 151 – 52 (2d Cir. 2006). The Officers \n12  having moved for summary judgment, we construe the evidence in the light \n13  most favorable to the OWS protesters. See id. Summary judgment may be \n14  granted only if “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \n15  movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \n16  IV. \n17    In Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001), the Supreme Court held \n18  that, when confronted with a question of law regarding the applicability of \n13 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  1P4a ogfe 3 174 of 37\n \n1  qualified immunity in a Section 1983 suit, federal courts should first deter‐\n2  mine “whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts \n3  alleged,” proceeding to the question of whether the right was clearly estab‐\n4  lished only if they answer the first question in the affirmative. The Court \n5  altered that framework eight years later in Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 \n6  (2009), holding that “courts should have the discretion to decide whether \n7  [the Saucier] procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.” Id. at 242. Because \n8  the question presented here “do[es] not frequently arise in cases in which a \n9  qualified immunity defense is unavailable,” Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. \n10  2012, 2020 (2014), we think it will be “worthwhile” to exercise that discretion \n11  here, Pearson, 555 U.S. at 242. Accordingly, we first address whether, taking \n12  the facts in the light most favorable to the protesters, the Officers are entitled \n13  to summary judgment because no constitutional violation occurred. We de‐\n14  cide that we cannot reach that conclusion as a matter of law on the present \n15  record. \n16  A. \n17  The OWS protesters assert they were falsely arrested in violation of \n18  their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures when \n14 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L

President was across the street and inside the Sheraton Hotel. To establish a \n3  § 1983 claim for false arrest, the OWS protesters must adduce evidence that: \n4  (i) the Officers intended to confine them; (ii) OWS protesters were conscious \n5  of the confinement and did not consent to it; (iii) the OWS protesters did not \n6  consent to being confined; and (iv) the confinement was not otherwise priv‐\n7  ileged. Jocks v. Tavernier, 316 F.3d 128, 134 – 35 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation omit‐\n8  ted). The protesters’ ability to satisfy the first three requirements is not dis‐\n9  puted; what is at issue is whether the detention was privileged under the \n10  “special needs” exception to the Fourth Amendment’s general probable \n11  cause requirement. See, e.g., City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 54 \n12  (2000). \n13  The special needs exception recognizes as constitutionally reasonable \n14  limited searches or temporary seizures that serve “special needs beyond the \n15  normal need for law enforcement,” where “the warrant and probable‐cause \n16  requirement [are] impracticable.” Skinner v. Railway Labor Execs. Ass’n, 489 \n17

crime investigation,” it must evaluate whether the search or seizure was \n6  “reasonable” in light of competing governmental and individual considera‐\n7  tions. MacWade v. Kelly, 460 F.3d 260, 268 – 69 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Nicholas \n8  v. Goord, 430 F.3d 652, 663 (2d Cir. 2005)). \n9  B. \n10  Here, the professed special need is protecting the President of the \n11  United States. As the Supreme Court has recognized, even in cases where \n12  the special needs doctrine was not involved, the “Nation undoubtedly has \n13  a valid, even an overwhelming, interest in protecting the safety of its Chief \n14

safety of the President and the Vice President,” the Court recognized the \n13  special need to protect the President and Vice President, which was “clearly \n14  beyond  the  normal  need  for  law  enforcement”  but  of  the  “utmost  im‐\n15  portance” because “[f]ew events debilitate the nation more than the assassi‐\n16  nation of a President.” Id. at 802 – 03 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n17  In recent years, the Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of \n18  Presidential safety in the context of granting qualified immunity to officers \n17 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  1P8a ogfe 3 178 of 37\n \n1  sued for actions taken to protect the President or Vice President. In Saucier, \n2  the Court ruled that a military police officer was qualifiedly immune from \n3  suit for using excessive force against a person protesting a speech by Vice \n4  President Gore. 533 U.S. at 208 – 09. The Court observed that the officer “did \n5  not know the full extent of the threat respondent posed or how many other \n6  persons there might be who, in concert with respondent, posed a threat to \n7  the security of the Vice President,” and, given that “[t]here were other po‐\n8  tential protesters in the crowd,” the officer “was required to recognize the \n9  necessity to protect the Vice President by securing respondent and restoring \n10  order to the scene.” Id. at 208. Thus, the Court concluded that “[i]t cannot be \n11  said there was a clearly established rule that would prohibit using the force \n12  petitioner did . . . .” Id. at 208 – 09.  \n13  In Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 660 (2012), the Court held Secret \n14  Service agents immune from suit for the retaliatory arrest of a person pro‐\n15  testing Vice President Cheney because they had probable cause to think the \n16  protester had committed a federal crime. Justice Ginsburg, concurring in \n17  that decision, observed that “[o]fficers assigned to protect public officials \n18  must make singularly swift, on the spot, decisions whether the safety of the \n18 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec

person they are guarding is in jeopardy.” Id. at 671. Most recently, in Wood \n2  v. Moss, 134 S. Ct. 2056 (2014), the Supreme Court granted Secret Service\n3  agents qualified immunity from a First Amendment suit by persons assert‐\n4  ing their opposition to President George W. Bush. The protesters com‐\n5  plained that, after the President made an unplanned stop at a restaurant, \n6  they were moved to a site further away from him while Bush supporters \n7  were not. Id. at 2061– 64. There was no claim of probable cause to think the \n8  protesters planned to commit any crime. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court \n9  concluded that the agents’ actions were objectively reasonable in light of a \n10  valid security concern that the anti‐Bush protesters, before they were relo‐\n11  cated, were within “weapons range” of the President dining on the patio. Id. \n12  at 2070. The Secret Service’s maps and travel plans, moreover, refuted argu‐\n13  ments that the basis for relocating the protesters was their political view‐\n14  points. Id. at 2069.  \n15  Of this precedent, only Stigile directly identifies protection of the Pres‐\n16  ident as a “special need,” and it does so in the context of a search, not a \n17  seizure. Nonetheless, these cases all generally recognize protection of the \n19 \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  2P0a ogfe 3 270 of 37\n \n1  President as a special need apart from routine law enforcement. See Fergu‐\n2  son, 532 U.S. at 79 (identifying special needs as those “divorced from the \n3  State’s general interest in law enforcement”). \n4  In light of the Supreme Court’s long recognition of the importance of \n5  protecting the President of the United States, we conclude that, as a matter \n6  of law, the circumstances of November 30, 2011, presented Officers with a \n7  special need. \n8  C. \n9  Having identified a special need, to assess the reasonableness of the \n10  Officers’ detention actions we must weigh the public interest served by \n11  those actions against the intrusion on the OWS protesters’ Fourth Amend‐\n12  ment right to be free from unreasonable seizures. See Skinner, 489 U.S. at 619; \n13  cf. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 16 (1968) (“[W]henever a police officer accosts an \n14  individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has ‘seized’ that per‐\n15  son.”). We have identified four “balancing factors” that are relevant to the \n16  reasonableness inquiry in the “special needs” context: \n17  (1) the weight and immediacy of the government interest; \n18  (2) the nature of the [liberty] interest allegedly compromised \n20 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  2P1a ogfe 3 271 of 37\n \n1  by the [detention]; (3) the character of the [deprivation] im‐\n2  posed by the [detention]; and (4) the efficacy of the [deten‐\n3  tion] in advancing the government interest. \n4  MacWade, 460 F.3d at 269 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n5    For the reasons explained above, protecting the President’s safety is a \n6  uniquely important government interest. See Wood, 134 S. Ct. at 2067 (recog‐\n7  nizing the “overwhelming[] interest in protecting the safety of [the] Chief \n8  Executive” (quoting Watts, 394 U.S. at 707)). But the liberty interest compro‐\n9  mised by the protesters’ detention is not to be dismissed out of hand, par‐\n10  ticularly given that its almost‐two hours’ duration is a far cry from the de \n11  minimis vehicle detentions that have previously been approved under the \n12  special needs exception. See, e.g., Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419, 427 (2004) \n13  (police information checkpoint regarding hit‐and‐run required “only a brief \n14  wait in line—a very few minutes at most” and “only a few seconds” of police \n15  contact); Sitz, 496 U.S. at 448 (average delay for each vehicle at sobriety \n16

near border was three to five minutes). Moreover, for the two hours they \n19  were detained, the protesters could not use a restroom. And those who felt \n21 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  2P2a ogfe 3 272 of 37\n \n1  ill were forced to choose between waiting out the detention period and de‐\n2  parting by ambulance. \n3  We recognize, as the Officers argue, that the protesters’ loss of liberty \n4  was limited to their freedom to depart the area for the two hours at issue. \n5  Specifically, the protesters were not handcuffed, searched, questioned, or \n6  transported to a police station. But this does not allow a court to conclude \n7  as a matter of law that the two‐hour detention was a reasonable means of \n8  meeting the special need presented. Non‐protesters, for example, were per‐\n9  mitted to leave the area after President Obama entered the Sheraton and was \n10  no longer in the line of sight of those on Seventh Avenue. The Officers con‐\n11  tend that the protesters presented unique security concerns because of the \n12  size of their group (more than 50), but no evidence was adduced as to why, \n13  after the President had entered the hotel and for the two hours he remained \n14  there, the protesters could not have been released from the press pen to pro‐\n15  ceed out of the area in smaller groups over time. \n16    The record evidence regarding relevant police practices is sparse. \n17  What there is does not compel the legal conclusion of special needs urged \n22 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  2P3a ogfe 3 273 of 37\n \n1  by the Officers. To the contrary, the NYPD’s own Patrol Guide advises of‐\n2  ficers to permit demonstrators “to leave a barriered area at any time.” Ap‐\n3  pendix at 572. To be sure, this advice pertains to protesters generally, not to \n4  circumstances involving the President. But no record evidence identifies a \n5  risk to President Obama’s safety if the protesters were permitted to leave in \n6  small groups, as provided in the Guide.6 Accordingly, on the record at sum‐\n7  mary judgment, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that there was “‘a \n8  close and substantial relationship’ . . . between the degree of intrusiveness \n9  [on the protesters’ liberty interests] and the governmental need asserted.” \n10  Cassidy v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 67, 81 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. \n11  Lifshitz, 369 F.3d 173, 186 (2d Cir. 2004). \n12  V. \n13  Qualified immunity protects officers from suit so long as “their con‐\n14  duct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of \n15  which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 \n16  U.S. 800, 818 (1982). We “do[ ] not require a case directly on point for a right \n                                            \n6   This is not to say that the Officers could not introduce evidence to support \na finding of efficacy. But, in the absence of such evidence, we cannot conclude on sum‐\nmary judgment that the protesters’ detention advanced President Obama’s physical safety \nso as to be reasonable in light of the special need presented.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  2P4a ogfe 3 274 of 37\n \n1  to  be  clearly  established”;  nevertheless,  “existing  precedent  must  have \n2  placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.” White v. \n3  Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omit‐\n4  ted). This is because qualified immunity “protects all but the plainly incom‐\n5  petent or those who knowingly violate the law.” Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. \n6  305, 308 (2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis \n7  added).  \n8  Thus, “the qualified immunity defense . . . protects an official if it was \n9  ‘objectively reasonable’ for him at the time of the challenged action to be‐\n10  lieve his acts were lawful.” Taravella v. Town of Wolcott, 599 F.3d 129, 134 (2d \n11  Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). “[W]hether a defendant official’s conduct was \n12  objectively reasonable, i.e., whether a reasonable official would reasonably \n13  believe his conduct did not violate a clearly established right, is a mixed \n14  question of law and fact.” Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) \n15  (emphasis added). Even so, the objective legal reasonableness of an officer’s \n16  action can be decided as a matter of law “in those cases where the facts con‐\n24 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec

(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n4  In applying these principles here, we begin with the district court’s \n5  conclusion that “why the protesters were detained” presented a genuine is‐\n6  sue of material fact that precluded summary judgment. Berg, 2016 WL \n7  4257525, at *4 (emphasis in original) (noting that even the N.Y.P.D. sector \n8  commander “admitted that he was unaware of any reason why his officers \n9  closed the press pen”). The conclusion runs afoul of existing precedent, \n10  which holds that “determining whether official conduct was objectively rea‐\n11  sonable requires examination of the information possessed by the officials \n12  at that time (without consideration of subjective intent).” Connecticut ex rel. \n13  Blumenthal v. Crotty, 346 F.3d 84, 106 (2d Cir. 2003) (alteration, citation, and \n14  internal quotation marks omitted); accord Garcia v. Does, 779 F.3d 84, 92 (2d \n15  Cir. 2015). In Crotty, we held that the “intent, motive or beliefs” of officials \n16  in enforcing the Nonresident Lobster Law (which was subsequently found \n17  to be unconstitutional) were irrelevant to the qualified immunity analysis. \n18  346 F.3d at 106. This is because “[i]nclusion of a subjective component, as \n25 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec

the Supreme Court instructed, produces inconsistent results and defeats the \n2  purpose of the doctrine by creating a factual issue requiring resolution by a \n3  jury.” Id. (citing Harlow, 457 U.S. at 815–16). In Garcia, we held that officers \n4  were entitled to qualified immunity against a suit for false arrest brought by \n5  a group of plaintiffs who had been arrested during a demonstration in sup‐\n6  port of Occupy Wall Street. There it was undisputed that the defendants \n7  “had,  from  their  personal  observations,  sufficient  evidence  to  establish \n8  probable cause on each of the elements of a disorderly conduct violation.” \n9  779 F.3d at 92. In such circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for de‐\n10  fendants to arrest the protesters. In urging otherwise, the Garcia plaintiffs \n11  argued that they reasonably believed the defendants had given them per‐\n12  mission to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on the vehicular roadway. Id. at 93. The \n13  court explained that the plaintiffs’ beliefs were not relevant to the qualified \n14  immunity analysis. Id. And further, the defendant police officers were enti‐\n15  tled to qualified immunity because even in the “confused and boisterous \n16  situation” in which they found themselves, it was objectively reasonable for \n17  them to think that the plaintiffs were illegally blocking a roadway and that \n26 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  2P7a ogfe 3 277 of 37\n \n1  “no official had expressly authorized the protesters to cross the Bridge via \n2  the roadway.” Id. at 93. \n3  The OWS protesters here argue that because “the [Officers] cannot \n4  identify the individual who made the decision, much less a non‐speculative \n5  justification for the decision to trap the demonstrators,” the Officers are not \n6  entitled to qualified immunity. Appellees’ Br. at 19. That reasoning is mis‐\n7  guided.7 In a court’s analysis of probable cause for an arrest, it is clear that \n8  “an arresting officer’s state of mind . . . is irrelevant to the existence of prob‐\n9  able cause”; indeed, the officer’s “subjective reason for making the arrest \n10  need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts [objectively] \n11  provide probable cause.” Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 153 (2004). Stated \n12  differently, “a claim for false arrest turns only on whether probable cause \n13  existed to arrest a defendant, and . . . it is not relevant whether probable \n14  cause existed with respect to each individual charge, or, indeed, any charge \n15  actually invoked by the arresting officer at the time of the arrest.” Jaegly v. \n16  Couch, 439 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir. 2006). In both Devenpeck and Jaegly it was \n                                            \n7   Although the protesters did not raise this specific argument before the dis‐\ntrict court, the district court did consider its substance as one of the factors in determining \nthat the Officers were not entitled to qualified immunity.  Berg, 2016 WL 4257525, at *4. \n27 \n

offense the officers said was the reason for arrest—were not subject to dam‐\n4  ages for false arrest under § 1983. \n5  A. \n6  We have applied an objective analytical framework when assessing \n7  qualified immunity based on special need. See Moore v. Vega, 371 F.3d 110, \n8  116  (2d  Cir.  2004)  (stating  that  where  qualified  immunity  is  based  on \n9  claimed special need to search parolee’s residence, the issue “is whether, in \n10  light of clearly established law and the information they possessed, the de‐\n11  fendants could have reasonably believed their search of plaintiff’s home to \n12  be lawful”). So here, we ask whether, under well‐established law at the time, \n13  and based on these facts, an officer could reasonably have believed that the \n14  actions taken to detain the OWS protesters were lawful in light of the special \n15  need to protect the President. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202. We answer that in‐\n16  quiry in the affirmative. \n17  Few cases address the manner in which a detention (as opposed to a \n18  search) should be balanced against a governmental interest in the “special \n28 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  2P9a ogfe 3 279 of 37\n \n1  needs” context. Nevertheless, the cases addressing the particular special \n2  need at issue here have emphasized the critical importance of protecting \n3  Presidential safety. See Hunter, 502 U.S. at 229 (noting that qualified im‐\n4  munity’s tolerance for reasonable error “is nowhere more important” than \n5  when protecting the life of the President).  \n6  In light of the government’s well‐recognized “overwhelming” inter‐\n7  est in the President’s safety, Wood, 134 S. Ct. at 2067, an objectively reasonable \n8  officer could have thought that the temporary detention here offered a per‐\n9  missible method of serving the heightened security need that exists during a \n10  Presidential visit.  \n11  Protecting the President in New York City routinely involves closing \n12  streets and cutting off traffic. See, e.g., Sarah Maslin Nir, One‐Man Traffic Jam \n13  Will Hit City When Trump Visits, N.Y. Times, Jan. 28, 2017, at A18; Obama in \n14  NYC Thursday for Fundraisers; Traffic Alerts, NBC New York, June 22, 2011. \n15  We have also observed, even in the First Amendment context, that “the gov‐\n16  ernment ha[s] a significant interest in ensuring that [a] protest remain[s] \n17  within [a designated area].” Kass v. City of New York, 864 F.3d 200, 208 (2d \n18  Cir. 2017). In Kass, the applicable interest was “maintaining public safety and \n29 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P0a ogfe 3 370 of 37\n \n1  order” and keeping public spaces “safe and free of congestion.” Id. (internal \n2  quotation marks omitted). The interest in protecting the President can be \n3  seen as of even greater public importance. See Watts, 394 U.S. at 707. Officers \n4  charged with the duty of protecting the President reasonably could have con‐\n5  cluded that—where OWS protesters had left the unrestricted designated pro‐\n6  test area and entered an area set aside not for them but for the press—a rea‐\n7  sonable way to allow the protesters to pursue their protest without risk that \n8  they would attempt to get closer still to the President was to require them to \n9  remain in the press pen until the President departed the area. With the ben‐\n10  efit of hindsight, other means might be imagined to safeguard the President \n11  while also allowing plaintiffs to protest with less restriction on their freedom \n12  of movement. But the officers were balancing a number of legitimate con‐\n13  cerns, including consideration for First and Fourth Amendment rights, in a \n14  dynamic situation. At the time in question no clearly established law sig‐\n15  naled that the Officers’ conduct fell outside the special needs doctrine.  \n16  Indeed, in the context of a routine law enforcement stop, a police of‐\n17  ficer with reasonable suspicion of criminal activity can detain a person for \n18  such time as is reasonably necessary to resolve that suspicion. See Terry, 392 \n30 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P1a ogfe 3 371 of 37\n \n1  U.S. at 21; Grice v. McVeigh, 873 F.3d 162, 167 – 68 (2d Cir. 2017). Police officers \n2  charged with protecting the President thus might have reasonably believed \n3  that they could temporarily deny freedom of movement to persons on the \n4  scene, perhaps even until the President had departed. In short, while the pre‐\n5  sent record does not permit us to conclude, as a matter of law, that the Offic‐\n6  ers’ actions went no further than the special need to protect the President \n7  warranted, no then clearly established law would have alerted reasonable \n8  officers that their actions did not fall within the special needs exception. \n9  Nor is a different conclusion warranted because the police did not \n10  deny all pedestrians and traffic movement to the same degree as the pro‐\n11  testers. Reasonable officers might have been particularly alert to risks posed \n12  by the Occupy Wall Street protesters, whose professed intent was to “#Oc‐\n13  cupyObama.” See Reichle, 566 U.S. at 672 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (finding \n14  that Secret Service agents were “duty bound” to take into account the con‐\n15  tent of an anti‐Iraq‐War protester’s statement to the Vice President when \n16  assessing whether he posed a threat). That a reasonable officer might objec‐\n17  tively think that OWS protesters would not leave the area upon release but, \n31 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P2a ogfe 3 372 of 37\n \n1  rather, would attempt to approach or gain access to the hotel and the Presi‐\n2  dent found some support in other OWS protesters’ actions only weeks ear‐\n3  lier in shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge. See Garcia, 779 F.3d at 88 (describ‐\n4  ing Occupy Wall Street October 1, 2011 demonstration precluding traffic \n5  moving on Brooklyn Bridge). \n6  In sum, in the absence of clearly established law prohibiting the chal‐\n7  lenged detentions in the circumstances presented, the Officers are entitled \n8  to qualified immunity. See Pauly, 137 S. Ct. at 552 (requiring that “clearly \n9  established law” be “particularized to the facts of the case” (internal quota‐\n10  tion marks omitted)). \n11  B. \n12  The OWS protesters also assert that they were unlawfully detained \n13  for the duration of the President’s visit in retaliation for exercising their First \n14  Amendment rights. Because the Officers have qualified immunity from suit \n15  based on their temporary detention of the protesters, these claims also fail. \n16  In Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 1995), we \n17  concluded that “if [an] officer either had probable cause or was qualifiedly \n18  immune from subsequent suit (due to an objectively reasonable belief that \n32 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P3a ogfe 3 373 of 37\n \n1  he had probable cause), then we will not examine the officer’s underlying \n2  motive in arresting and charging the plaintiff.” The same reasoning applies \n3  to qualified immunity based on an objectively reasonable belief of special \n4  needs. We have determined above that officers in the position of protecting \n5  the President, as here, would have an objectively reasonable belief under the \n6  circumstances that the special needs presented in this case justified their lim‐\n7  ited detention of the protesters. Our rationale in Singer thus accords the Of‐\n8  ficers qualified immunity from the protesters’ retaliation claims. \n9  C. \n10  The protesters’ claim that certain officers failed to intervene to protect \n11  constitutional violations likewise fails. To recover on a claim for “[f]ailure to \n12  intercede to prevent an unlawful arrest,” plaintiffs “must still overcome the \n13  hurdle of qualified immunity.” Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 124 F.3d 123, \n14  129 (2d Cir. 1997). A non‐intervening police officer becomes liable when \n15  “such failure permitted fellow officers to violate . . . clearly established stat‐\n16  utory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have \n17  known.” Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For the same \n18  reasons the Officers have qualified immunity for OWS’s detention, it was \n33 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P4a ogfe 3 374 of 37\n \n1  not  “objectively  unreasonable”  for  Officers  McNamara,  Loehle,  and \n2  Latalardo to conclude that their “fellow Officers’ conduct did not violate” \n3  OWS’s rights. Id.  \n4  D. \n5  The Officers are also entitled to qualified immunity on OWS’s selec‐\n6  tive enforcement claim. To assert a claim for selective enforcement, a plain‐\n7  tiff must allege: “(1) [that] the person, compared with others similarly situ‐\n8  ated, was selectively treated; and (2) that such selective treatment was based \n9  on impermissible considerations such as . . . the exercise of constitutional \n10  rights . . . .” LaTrieste Rest. & Cabaret Inc. v. Vill. of Port Chester, 40 F.3d 587, \n11  590 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting LeClair v. Saunders, 627 F.2d 606, 609 – 10 (2d Cir. \n12  1980)).  \n13  The Officers argue that in light of Marcavage v. City of New York, 689 \n14  F.3d 98 (2d Cir. 2012) and Wood, it is unclear that protesters are similarly \n15  situated to the general public when Presidential security is concerned. We \n16  agree.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P5a ogfe 3 375 of 37\n \n1  In Marcavage, we held that officers’ establishment of a “no‐demonstra‐\n2  tion zone,” which permitted pedestrians and ordinary traffic but not pro‐\n3  testers on the sidewalk in front of Madison Square Garden, was a reasonable \n4  time, place, and manner restriction, narrowly tailored to the security risks \n5  raised by a large group of protesters. 689 F.3d at 104 – 05. The officers had \n6  blocked off the sidewalk in response to a convention that both the President \n7  and the Vice President were attending. Under Marcavage, it is clear reason‐\n8  able officers could proceed on the understanding that the presence of pro‐\n9  testers on a sidewalk outside a building where the President was located \n10  raised unique concerns that are not raised by the presence of ordinary (non‐\n11  protester) pedestrians. Id. at 105.  \n12  In Wood, the anti‐Bush protesters argued that “had the agents’ pro‐\n13  fessed interest in the President’s safety been sincere, the agents would have \n14  directed all persons present . . . to be screened or removed from the prem‐\n15  ises.” 134 S. Ct. at 2069. Important to our analysis here, the Court in Wood \n16  concluded that the individuals dining in the restaurant did not pose the \n17  same type of security risks as a group of 200 to 300 people standing outside \n18  the restaurant. Id. That the members of the public dining in the restaurant \n35 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P6a ogfe 3 376 of 37\n \n1  did not choose that location to confront the President, and “could not have \n2  had any expectation that they would see the President that evening,” ren‐\n3  dered the security concerns raised by the protesters distinct from average \n4  diners. Id. \n5  It is undisputed that the OWS protesters had pre‐planned their pro‐\n6  test to challenge the President’s fundraising dinner, promoted the event \n7  through social media, and adapted their plan to be as close to the President \n8  as possible. The size of the protest, which, according to the protesters, con‐\n9  sisted of anywhere from 75 to 200 people, presented unique security con‐\n10  cerns. See Wood, 134 S. Ct. at 2069 (explaining that “[t]he Secret Service . . . \n11  could take measures to ensure that the relatively small number of people \n12  already inside the Inn were kept under close watch; no similar surveillance \n13  would have been possible for 200 to 300 people congregating in front of the \n14  Inn”). At bottom, a reasonable officer could believe that the OWS protesters \n15  were engaged in conduct different from that of regular pedestrians and that \n16  the protesters therefore were not similarly situated to those pedestrians. See \n17  Marcavage, 689 F.3d at 106 – 07. The Officers are thus entitled to qualified \n18  immunity on OWS’s selective enforcement claims. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1C:1a2s-ec v1-60-33319416-,L DAoKc-uGmWeGnt   1 D2o0c, u0m7/e2n5t/ 2103148  ,  F2i3le5d2 20175/2, 5P/1a8g e  3P7a ogfe 3 377 of 37\n1  VI. \n2  Protecting the President’s safety is among the most important of law \n3  enforcement duties. The assassination of a President does violence not only \n4  to the individual who occupies the office and to the stability of the nation \n5  but also to the democratic ideals that guide our system of government. At \n6  the same time, the Constitution guarantees citizens freedom from unwar‐\n7  ranted infringement of their rights to freedom of expression and movement. \n8  For the reasons stated, we cannot conclude that the Officers balanced \n9  those competing considerations here in a way that violated clearly estab‐\n10  lished law. We thus decide that they are entitled to qualified immunity on \n11  the claims asserted against them. The decision of the district court denying \n12  the Officers qualified immunity is reversed. The case is remanded with in‐\n13  structions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. \n37 ",
