The Eighth (8th) Amendment ri^ht to be free from cruel and unusual\npunislunent. By placing the plaintiff in segregation it is cruel and unusual\nbecause, including but not limited to, it take's plaintiff out of general\npopulation where she can talk and be around other prisoner's. And it\nforce's the plaintiff to sit in a small cell where she is not free to walk\naround and exercise like inmate's in general population.\n2. The fourteenth (14th) Amendment right to Due Process of Law prior\nto the imposition oC punisJunent. The Plaintiff is being punished by this\ninstitution prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with IXic Process\nof Law, because, plaintiff has been placed in segregation, without IXJC\nProcess of Law, because of her medical problem's.\nThat in light of Turner v. Saflcy, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (1987), the Defendant\nshould find an alternative to placing the Plaintiff in segregation because\nof her medical condition. With there being sixty-four (64) cell's in the\nfemale population section of this institution, seperated in four (4) equal\nPage 4\n\nsection's, and there being only thirty (30) to thirty\"five (35) female\nprisoner's housed in this institution on a daily hasis, and there being a\nminimum of three (3) female II,I,V. patient's in this institution, this\ninstitution, at de ininimis cost, could and should house said II.J..V. patient's,\nand in particular the plaintiff, in one of the four (4) a P. ore-mentioned\nfemale section's of this institution at no added risk to the security and\nhealth consideration's of this institution.\nRELlIiF\nV/IIIIRLil'ORE, plaintiff respectfully request's that this honorabLe court\nenter a judgement granting the plaintiff;\n1. A declaratory judgement that the defendant's act's, policies and\npractice's herein described and complained of violated plaintiff's right's\nunder the United State's Constitution.\n2, A preliminary and permanent Injunction which;\nA, Prohibit's the defendant's, their successor's in office, agent's\nand employee's and all other person's in active concert and participation\nwith them from placing the plaintiff in segregation because of her medical\ncondition.\nB. Proliib.it1.1; the defendant's, their successor's in office, agent's\nand employee's and all other person's in active concert and participation\nwith them from transferring the plaintiff to any other institution, without\nplaintiff's express consent, during the pendency of this law suit, or other\nwise retaliating against the plaintiff in any other manner.\nPage 5\n\nC. Require's the defendant, Jolm E. Wright, to submit within ninety\n(90) day's of this court's order and declaration of the unconstitutional]ty\nof the defendant's policy and procedure's of placing II.I.V. patient's in\nsegregation a list of proposed procedure's and criteria that comply with\n»\nthis court's declaration and order and the Eighth (8th) and l:ourtcenth (14th)\nAmendment's of the United State's Constitution.\n3. And an order from the court that order's the defendant to pay to the\nplaintiff one (1,000,000.00) million dollar's in punitive and compensetory\ndamage's\n4. And any and all such further relief as this honorable court deem's\nfair and appropriate.\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\\\nKaren R.

Wright\nCivil No. JFM-88-2308\nDear Counsel:\nI have entered the consent decree which you have submitted.\nI am writing this letter (and making it a part of the court\nrecord) to state that by signing this consent decree I am not\nruling upon the constitutionality of the procedures which it\nestablishes.  I am merely acknowledging that the parties have\nagreed that the procedures are constitutional.  I am making this\ndisclaimer because, as you know, I presently have pending before\nme litigation involving the policies and procedures concerning\nthe treatment of HIV-positive inmates in the state correctional\nsystem, and I do not want my signing of the consent order in\nthese cases to be deemed to be a prejudgment of the issues which\nremain to be resolved in the other litigation.\nI again want to thank you for the responsible manner in\nwhich you have handled these cases.\nVery truly yours,\nJ. Frederick\nUnited States District Judge\ncc:  Court File\nCrutchfield v. Wright\nJC-MD-003-002\n\n Z A ^^  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \\  \\^\nL\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND  \\^<\nKAREN RENEE CRUTCHFIELD, et al.,  *  °t\\^  S\nPlaintiff  *  ^\\  '$£  ^\nV.  *  CIVIL ACTION NO.\\^%\nJFM-88-2308  '\nJOHN E. WRIGHT,  *  %\nDefendant  *\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\nCONSENT DECREE\nPlaintiffs, Karen Crutchfield, Tawanda Powell, and\nJacqueline Walker, and Defendant, John Wright, through their\nrespective undersigned attorneys, agree to the dismissal of the\nabove-captioned matter and in support thereof state:\n1.  This case arose from three separate complaints\nfiled in the U. S. District Court for the District of Maryland,\nnamely, Case Nos. JFM 88-2392 (Jacqueline Walker v. John Wright),'\nJFM 88-2351 (Tawanda Powell v. John Wright), and JFM 88-2308\n(Karen Crutchfield v. John Wright).  The three cases were\nconsolidated as JFM 88-2308 by Order of this Court dated\nSeptember 15, 1988.\n2.  Plaintiffs asserted that Defendant had violated\ntheir respective constitutional rights pursuant to the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments and, therefore, had violated 42 U.S.C.\n§198 3.  The factual predicate for this; claim derived from\nPlaintiffs' respective placement in an area of the Montgomery\n\nCounty Detention Center that was segregated from the general\npopulation.  Plaintiffs had been placed in this manner pursuant\ni\nto their having tested positive for the HIV virus  (AIDS).\n3.  By July, 1989, the Detention Center had ceased the\npractice set forth in paragraph 2,  supra.\n4.  The Policy and Procedure used by the Montgomery\nCounty Detention Center has been revised to remedy the problem\naddressed by Plaintiffs in their Complaints and, also, to provide\nfurther confidentiality regarding any inmates who may have tested\npositive for the HIV virus.\n5.  The parties, through their attorneys, agree that\nthe Policy and Procedure 3000-17, effective July 1, 1990,\nresponds to their respective concerns and constitutes a fair and\nreasonable policy.  (A copy of the Policy is attached hereto as\nExh. A.)  As such, the parties agree that further proceedings in\nthis cause of action are unnecessary.\n6.  Defendant agrees henceforth to operate the\nMontgomery County Detention Center in a manner consistent with\nthe terms of Policy and Procedure 3000-17 and the Constitution of\nthe United States.\n7.  The parties agree that nothing in this Agreement\nis intended to prevent Defendant from implementing new procedures\nwhich benefit Plaintiffs and other inmates similarly situated,\nand it shall not diminish any substantive rights or procedural\nprotection they may now have or hereafter acquire under state or\nfederal statutes.\n-2-\n\n8.  This Consent Decree does not resolve the claims of\nPlaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs.  Plaintiffs may\npetition the Court for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\nDefendant reserves the right to contest any petition by\nPlaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs.\nWHEREFORE, the parties, through their undersigned\nattorneys, respectfully request that the Court accept this\nConsent Decree and dismiss this cause with prejudice.\nRespectfully submitted,\nCLYDE H.
