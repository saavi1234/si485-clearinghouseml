The plaintiffs, represented by private and public counsel, sought and received class certification including all Alaska public school students with qualified disabilities. The plaintiffs asked the court for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendant's High School Graduation Qualifying Examination (HSGQE) discriminated against students with disabilities and failed to provide an alternate assessment that leads to a standard diploma.</p><p>Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that in formulating and administering the Alaska HSGQE, Defendants failed and refused to take into account the needs of students with disabilities. Defendants restrict the plaintiffs' access to many of the most common learning accommodations available under Individualized Education Programs (\"IEPs\") or education plans established pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The plaintiffs allege that the HSGQE discriminates against students with disabilities because, among other problems, (1) there is no meaningful access to an alternate assessment, (2) the accommodations policies illegally burden students' rights to use the tools necessary to demonstrate their skills, and (3) the HSGQE unfairly tests disabled students on material they have never been taught. </p><p>On April 7, 2004, the plaintiffs and defendant filed a joint stipulation that allowed students with disabilities in the Class of 2004 to get a diploma without passing the HSGQE and agreed to negotiate a settlement. On January 20, 2005, the District Court (Judge James K. Singleton) granted final approval of the class settlement agreement stating that defendant was to develop equitable provisions and issue semi-annual reports to the plaintiffs' counsel for purposes of monitoring defendant's compliance.</p><p>The settlement lasted until 2008 without any further litigation. The case is now closed. </p>",

INTRODUCTION \n1 \n2  This is a putative class action disability discrimination case brought on \n3 \nbehalf of approximately 18,000 students with disabilities in Alaska public schools who \n4 \nhave taken or must take the High School Graduation QualiJYing Exam (\"HSGQE\") in \n5 \norder to receive a high school diploma. The complaint in this action was filed on March \n6 \n7  16,2004, alleging violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n8 \n(\"IDEA\"), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Rehab Act\"), the Americans with \n9 \nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\"), the Federal and Alaska State Constitutions, and various state \n10 \nlaws.  t>laintiIfs also med a class certification motion on March 17, 2004, seekmg \n11 \n12  certification of a class of all students eligible for an Individualized Education Program \n13 \n(,'IEP\") pursuant to the IDEA or a Section 504 Education Plan (\"504 plnn\") pursuant to \n14 \nthe Rehab Act, who have taken or will be required to take the HSGQE. \n15 \nThe undersigned Parties, by and through their counsel of record, have \n16 \n17  agreed to limited interim relief to (I) protect students with IEPs or 504 plans in the class \n18 \nof 2004 who would otherwise be denied high school diplomas this spring due to their \n19 \nfailure to fully fulfill the HSGQE graduation requirement and (2) provide additional \n20 \nopportunity for pursuit of a complete resolution of these claims through negotiation. \n21 \n22  Counsel for the parties met on March 22, 2004 in Anchorage, Alaska to discuss these \n23 \nIssues. \n24 \nThis Stipulation shall in no way be construed as an admission ofliability \n25 \nby the Defendants or as a limitation on claims that Plaintiffs may assert. This \nJoint Stip & Proposed Order  Page 2 of7 \nNoon v. State  A04-0057 CV (JKS) \n\nStipulation is without prejudice to any Party's right to assert any claim or defense, or to \n1 \n2  the ultimate determination of the Parties' legal rights before this Court. Except as \n3 \nexplicitly set forth herein, this Stipulation shall in no way be interpreted to otherwise \n4 \nimpair Defendants' discretion to administer the HSGQE to Alaska public school \n5 \nstudents, set educational standards, or determine graduation requirements. \n6 \n7  ll.  STIPULATION \n8 \nA.  Class Certification \n9 \nI.  The Parties agree and hereby stipulate that Plaintiffs have alleged \n10 \nsufficient underlying facts such that the purported class, as defined in this stipulation, \n11 \n12  meets the requirements of both Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2).  The \n13 \nParties agree that it would be impracticable to join every student with on IEP or 504 \n14 \nplan who would ultimately be required to take the HSGQE to obtain a high school \n15 \ndiploma. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(a)(I).  The Parties further agree that Plaintiffs' \n16 \n17  challenge to the HSGQE implicates numerous questions of law and fact that are \n18 \ncommon to every putative class member.  See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(a)(2).  Additionally, \n19 \nthe Parties agree that the named student Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the re~t of the \n20 \nclass members, and that the named student Plaintiffs will provide adequate and fair \n21 \n22  representation of the rights of the entire class.  See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(a)(3)-(4). \n23 \nFinally, the Parties agree that Defendants' alleged conduct is based upon grounds \n24 \ngenerally applicable to the class, and that the most appropriate remedy for the alleged \n25 \nJoint Stip & Proposed Order  Page 3 of7 \nNoon v. State  A04-00S7 CY (JKS) \n\nconduct, if any, would be final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with \n1 \n2  respect to the class as a whole. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(b)(2). \n3 \n2.  Accordingly, the Parties agree that the following class definition would be \n4 \nappropriate for purposes of this case at this time, should the Court find that Plaintiffs' \n5 \npurported class meets the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23: \n6 \n7  All students who have an Individualized Education Program \n(\"IEP\") pursuant to the Iodividuals with Disabilities Education Act \n8 \nor a Section 504 Education Plan (\"504 Plan\") pursuant to the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, and who have taken or will be required \n9 \nto take the Alaska High School Graduation Qualifying Examination \nr-\n~ ______lo_  II_ ________~ (~\"~HS~GQ£J~'  __~   _________________________________ \n11 \nThe agreements contained herein are applicable only to students with disabilities in the \n12 \nPlaintiff class.  TIle Parties have not reached an agreement at this time concerning the \n13 \nappropriateness of organizational Plaintiff, Learning Disabilities Association of Alaska, \n14 \n15  serving as a class representative; the Parties reserve their rights to advance any \n16 \nargument concerning this issue hereafter in this litigation. \n17 \nB.  Limited Interim Relief \n18 \n3.  The Parties agree and hereby stipulate that HSGQE test results will not be \n19 \n20  used to deny any class member a diploma in spring 2004 provided that the class \n21 \nmember meets aU other criteria for graduation and a diploma. \n22 \n4.  Specific notice of the above will be sent by the state to all high school \n23 \n24  principals and special education directors on or before April 13,2004.  The notice shall \n25  instruct districts to send notice to parents and special education teachers of class \nJoint Stip & Proposed Order  Page 4 of? \nNoon v.  State  A04-0057 CV (JKS) \n\nmembers affected by this order.  Both the plaintiffs and the State shall take steps to \nI \n2  facilitate compliance with the court's order. \n3  c. \nSuspension of Requirements of Civil Rules \n4 \n5.  The parties agree and hereby stipulate that they will enter into negotiations \n5 \nregarding matters raised in this case, with the intent that proposals will be prepared for \n6 \n7  presentation to the Alaska Board of Education and Early Devdopment.  During this \n8 \ntime of negotiation, the parties agree that all time deadlines and requirements in the \n9 \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, including the requirement of a responsive pleading \n10 \nand the initiation of discovery, shall be suspended.  The Parties shall hold their first \n11 \n12  negotiation session on or before May  18, 2004, unless otherwise agreed to by all Parties. \n13 \nThe parties shall report back to the court no later than July 9 regarding the progress of \n14 \nnegotiations.  If negotiations are not successful regarding all issues in this maUer, the \n15 \nparties will stipulate to, or ask the court to set, a timeline for further proceedings in this \n16 \n17  case; the Parties also agree to cooperate in providing for expedited discovery. \n18 \nDISABILITY LAW ADVOCATES \n19 \nAttorneys for Plaintiffs \n20 \n21 \nBy: \n22 \nWolinsky \nalifomia Bar No. 33716 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nJoint Slip & Proposed Order  Page 5 of7 \nNoon v.

The information will include descriptions of the options for \nDI\n19 participation in the HSGQE by students with disabilities, the implication of each of the options, \n20 and the appeals process.  The Department shall further clarify in the Participation Guidelines \n21 (and in any other publications or websites designed to provide information about \n22 accommodations on the HSGQE) that:  \n23 a.  the guideline concerning the use of a proposed HSGQE accommodation \n24 for three months prior to test in the classroom is a recommendation only \n25 and is not a requirement; \n26 b.  any list (regulatory or otherwise) of approved accommodations published \n27 by the Department as a guide for school Districts shall not be deemed \n28 exclusive by the Department.  With respect to any potential \n \nNoon v. Alaska State Bd. of Educ. & Early Dev., Case No. A04-0057 CV (JKS) \nSettlement Agreement \n5 \n\n \n1 accommodation that is not on the “approved” list, the Department will \n2 provide IEP and 504 Plan teams with a checklist and/or guidelines with \n3 criteria to be used in determining if an accommodation is appropriate.   \n4 2.  The Department shall work with Districts to ensure test security while allowing \n5 students with disabilities the opportunity to: \n6 a.  take the HSGQE over the course of more than one day if necessary to \n7 accurately demonstrate proficiency on the HSGQE; and \n8 b.  take the HSGQE at home, provided that, due to a disability, the student’s \n9 primary instruction location is the student’s own home. \n10 3.  IEP and 504 Plan teams shall meet in accordance with the timeline set forth \n11 herein.  Plans for all students with disabilities shall be reviewed in their next annual IEP or 504 \n12 Plan review (and then at least annually thereafter) for the presence and appropriateness of \nS \nE 13 accommodations to be used in the HSGQE.  \nT\nA3 \nOCe 30612  14 4.

The Department will broaden the current list of appropriate accommodations for \n21 students with disabilities and shall at least annually consider the appropriateness of other \n22 proposed accommodations that may arise.  Districts retain the right to deny a requested \n23 accommodation on a case-by-case basis and provide the reasons or basis for the denial.   \n24 6.  A student’s IEP or 504 Plan Team will initially determine whether a particular \n25 proposed modification for use on the Modified HSGQE will be helpful to a student on the \n26 Subtest(s) of the HSGQE which the student has not passed.  The IEP or 504 Plan team will then \n27 apply to the Department for approval of the proposed modification.  The Department will \n28 determine whether the benefit of the modification outweighs its potentially adverse effect on the \n \nNoon v. Alaska State Bd. of Educ. & Early Dev., Case No. A04-0057 CV (JKS) \nSettlement Agreement \n6 \n\n \n1 validity of the test.  In balancing the benefits against the potential drawbacks, the Department \n2 shall consider the effect of the proposed modification on an entire Subtest, not just on a single \n3 construct of that Subtest.   \n4 B.  Sequence of Testing \n5 1.  The Commissioner shall promptly recommend to the Board appropriate \n6 regulations concerning the alternative assessment program under the provisions of Alaska \n7 Statutes § 14.03.075(c) to implement the following procedure for accessing the HSGQE: \n8 a.  If an eligible student fails to pass any subtests of the HSGQE, the \n9 student’s IEP or 504 Plan team shall determine whether the student \n10 should: \n11 i.  retake those subtests of the HSGQE with other accommodations; \n12 or  \nS \nE 13 ii.  take the Modified HSGQE for those subtests with appropriate \nT\nA3 \nOCe 30612  14 accommodations and any of the modifications approved by the \nBILITY RIGHTS ADV49 Fifteenth Street, SuitOakland, California 94(510) 451-8644  111567 Dep12a..r  tmsaisegknnitn ,l gain nacg ltuueadsgti nepg ri,on bctetuortpr n rfeoottar  ltciimolanir tioefidfc  tateotsi:ot  nq uoefs ati otensst  fqoure as tdioena,f  \nA4\nS 18 student, \nDI\n19 3.  spell-checker on a word processor, \n20 4.  grammar checker on a word processor, \n21 5.  oral presentation (read-aloud) of test question (including \n22 recorded oral presentation), \n23 6.  graphing calculator, \n24 7.  dictionary or thesaurus, \n25 8.  math or writing resource guides, \n26 9.  voice recognition software and word processor, \n27 10. asking test proctor for synonym of unknown word; or \n28\n \nNoon v.

Non-standardized Assessment Format that Leads to a Standard Diploma \n7 1.  The non-standardized assessment is reserved only for those diploma-track \n8 students who:  \n9\na.  are working at or near grade level; \n10\nb.  have a documented history of being unable to demonstrate proficiency on a \n11\nstandardized assessment because of one or more of the following conditions: \n12\nS  (i)  the student has a severe emotional or behavioral impairment or a \nE 13\nT\nA3 \nOCe 30612  14 pervasive developmental or other disability that causes the student \nBILITY RIGHTS ADV49 Fifteenth Street, SuitOakland, California 94(510) 451-8644  111567 tsmota obndedi fauircndaa ttbieolsent istno; g m, eavinetna iwn isthu fafciccioemntm coodnacteinotnrsa toior na ptop rpoaprrtiiactiep ate in \nA4\nDIS 18 (ii)  the student cannot cope with the demands of a prolonged test \n19\nadministration because of multiple physical disabilities, severe \n20\nhealth-related disabilities, or a neurological disorder; \n21\n(iii)  the student has a significant motor, learning, or communication \n22\ndisability that causes the student to need more time than is \n23\nreasonable or available for testing, even with the allowance of \n24\nextended time. \n25\n26   2.  The Department shall make available an appropriate non-standardized assessment \n27 using formats or a format that fairly assesses a disabled student’s mastery of state content \n28 standards and eligibility for a standard high school diploma.  This non-standardized format: \n \nNoon v. Alaska State Bd. of Educ. & Early Dev., Case No. A04-0057 CV (JKS) \nSettlement Agreement \n8 \n\n \n1 a.

May be, but is not required to be, a system of individualized assessment \n6 whereby a student’s IEP or 504 Plan team develops (with the oversight \n7 and approval of the Board or Department of Education) a system of \n8 assessment for that particular student that measures the student’s \n9 qualifications to obtain a high school diploma without directly assessing \n10 the student’s disability. \n11   3.  The Department will provide appropriate and thorough guidance and information \n12 to Districts, which will provide training to IEP teams, 504 teams, other instructional planning \nS \nE 13 teams, parents, and students concerning this non-standardized assessment option leading to a \nT\nA3 \nOCe 30612  14 standard high school diploma for students who qualify under this provision. \nBILITY RIGHTS ADV49 Fifteenth Street, SuitOakland, California 94(510) 451-8644  111567 with theD1 .D.  epartPAmaperpennet tabsl esof foo frs etAu adc ecDnoitmsst rmwiciott dhre aIjtEeiocPtnss   aaannnd da  5cMc0o4om dPmilfaioncdsa atmitoiaonyn  D roeerq cmuiseoisodt nitfhsi caat taio Dn iostnr itchte c gornosuunltd s \nA4\nS 18 that the accommodation or modification would make a test invalid.

The parent of a student with an IEP or 504 Plan \n21 may request mediation, a due process hearing, or a state complaint, consistent with state and \n22 federal law and regulations.  In this type of an appeal, the procedure will be consistent with 4 \n23 AAC 52.550(g) and applicable federal law.

Alaska State Bd. of Educ. & Early Dev., Case No. A04-0057 CV (JKS) \nSettlement Agreement \n9 \n\n \n1 1.  For school year 2004-05 only, a District shall grant a waiver to a student with a \n2 disability who has an IEP or 504 Plan, is a senior, and has met all other requirements of \n3 graduation, and the student’s IEP or 504 Plan team does not meet on or before September 24, \n4 2004, and because of the failure to meet, \n5 a.  the student does not have two opportunities during the 2004-2005 school \n6 year to use an allowable modification that an IEP or 504 Plan team \n7 determines the student needs to demonstrate proficiency on the state \n8 assessment; or \n9 b.  the student does not receive the non-standardized assessment for which the \n10 student is eligible during the 2004-2005 school year. \n11 2.    The parties acknowledge that the non-standardized assessment will be a new \n12 instrument and that training of personnel and development of this instrument will be evolving \nS \nE 13 over the year.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the non-standardized assessment be phased-in \nT\nA3 \nOCe 30612  14 during the 2005 school year.  To accomplish this, in 2005 only, the grading standards for the \nBILITY RIGHTS ADV49 Fifteenth Street, SuitOakland, California 94(510) 451-8644  111567 nriogno-rsotuasn   daasr tdhiez efdin aasl ssetsasnmdaerndt sw. ill be published as “interim standards,” which may not be as \nA4\nS 18 V.  IMPLEMENTATION & REPORTING \nDI\n19 1.  Defendants shall take all necessary steps to implement the terms of this \n20 Agreement.  The parties understand that implementation of this Agreement will require adoption \n21 of regulations by the Board, and that the Board will exercise its independent judgment in the best \n22 interests of the State when adopting regulations. The parties further understand that this \n23 Agreement does not purport to bind the Alaska State Legislature, and that a change in state or \n24 federal law may moot or otherwise obviate this Agreement. \n25 2.  The Department shall designate a State employee or official as the Facilitator \n26 responsible for collecting information concerning compliance with this Agreement, and \n27 producing the semi-annual reports referenced in Paragraph V.7 below.  In addition to other \n28\n \nNoon v.

Plaintiffs are not required to exhaust the administrative procedures set forth in the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400,  et seq., because they \nare challenging policies and practices of general applicability that are contrary to numerous \nfederal  laws (including  IDEA)  and because P laintiffs  cannot obtain adequate relief through \nadministrative remedies.  \n4.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  All Defendants reside \nin the District of Alaska, and all of the events giving rise to this action occurred in the District of \nAlaska. \nINTRODUCTION \n5.  This action arises out of the discrimination by Defendants ALASKA STATE \nBOARD  OF  EDUCATION  AND EAR LY  DEVELOPMENT,  ROGER  SAMPSON,  the \nANCHORAGE SCHOOL DISTRICT, and RICHARD SMILEY (“Defendants”) against students \nwith disabilities in the Alaska public school sy stem.  Defendants are forcing vulnerable students \nwith disabilities to pass the Alaska High School Graduation Qualifying Examination (sometimes \nhereafter referred to as the “Exit Exam” or “HSGQE”) in order to receive a diploma in Spring \n2004 without the preparation or safeg uards required by law.  In doing so, they are ignoring the \neducational attainments of these students, flagrantly violating their rights, destroying their self \nesteem, and damaging their academic, professional and employment opportunities forever.   \n6.  In  formulating  and administering   the Alaska  HSGQE,  Defendants  failed  and \nrefused to take into account the needs of students with disabilities.  According  to recent Alaska \nspecial education data, Defendants’ conduct affects 18,000 students in the Alaska public school \nsystem with special education needs.  Of these, nearly half have specific learning disabilities.  \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n1 \n\n \nAnother quarter have speech and language disabilities.  The rest of these students ex perience a \nvariety  of  other  mental and phy sical  disabilities, including   low vision/blindness, deafness, \nautism, or orthopedic disabilities.   \n7.  As of December 15, 2003, 69.7% of special education students in the Anchorag e \nSchool District alone were ineligible for diplomas in 2004 because they had failed the HSGQE, \nwith only one opportunity left to pass before their  scheduled graduation date.  Throughout \nAlaska, students with disabilities have the lowest passag e rate of any discrete group of Alaska \nstudents.  Without immediate intervention by this Court, more than 500 students with disabilities \nstatewide  who  are on a diploma trac k will be denied diplomas this spring.   This number \ncomprises over two-thirds of all Alaska special education students in the class of 2004. \n8.  The “high stakes” consequences of the HSGQE (that is, the complete denial of a \ndiploma solely because the student fails the exam regardless of the student’s other achievements) \nmay lead to increased drop-out rates for special education students and other students with \ndisabilities.  Many students, perhaps hundreds in the Anchorag e School District alone,  have \naccelerated their course of study – sacrificing extracurricular activities and health considerations \n– to graduate in January before the graduation requirement became effective in February 2004.  \nMany other students with disabilities are fleeing  the Alaska public school  system to attend \nprivate schools, which can cost thousands of dollars a semester per family, so that the student can \navoid exposure to the discriminatory HSGQE and can obtain a high school diploma. \n9.  In spite of the multiple and sig nificant defects of the  High School Graduation \nQualifying Examination as it affects students with disabilities, Defendants administered the exam \nin February 2004, and will prevent the students in the class of 2004 who have otherwise satisfied \nall of the necessary graduation requirements but who have not passed the HSGQE from receiving \nthe diploma they have struggled for years to obtain.   \n10.  The High School Exit Exam has three parts: reading , writing and mathematics.  \nThe  reading  portion of the test, which includes multiple-choice and  constructed-response \nquestions, uses excerpts from published literature as the basis for evaluating students’ reading \nskills.  The writing test includes both multiple-choice questions and short essays and evaluates \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n2 \n\n \nwriting composition and knowledge of “conventions” of Standard English.  The mathematics test \ncovers procedures such as estimation and mental computation; computation problems; reading, \ninterpreting and constructing graphs; and principles of geometry and measurement.   \n11.   Students take the Exit Exam for the first time in tenth g rade, and can retake any \nportion that they do not pass in eleventh and twelfth grades and for an additional three years after \nthey graduate High School.  The test is given twice a y ear and students must pass all three \nsections of the test or they will not receive a diploma. \n12.   Defendants require all public school students in the Class of 2004 to pass the Exit \nExam in order to graduate from high school.   \n13.  The consequences to students of failing  to pass the Ex it Exam are potentially \ndevastating and lifelong.  Regardless of how brig ht and talented students are,  how hard they \nwork, or how high achieving they may be, students who do not pass the exam will not graduate \nfrom high school, will not receive a reg ular diploma, and will be severely disadvantaged in \napplying for employment, college admission or vocational training  programs.  These students \nwill  be relegated to a life of substantially less earning power, lowered expectations, fewer \nopportunities, and increased vulnerability to poverty and homelessness.  \n14.  The Exit Exam discriminates against children with disabilities in numerous ways.   \nDefendants illegally burden and restrict Plaintiffs’ access to  many of the most common learning \naccommodations available under Individualized Education Programs (“IEPs”) or education plans \nestablished pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“section 504 plans”). \n15.   Federal law requires that students with disabilities be permitted to use reasonable \naccommodations on all statewide tests.  However, Defendants permit students to use some \naccommodations on an “optional assessment” only after the student first (1) makes the futile \ngesture of taking the HSGQE without the necessary  accommodation, and (2) fails the test.  \nDefendants thus force disabled students to endure the humiliation of needlessly  proving the \nextent of their disability before allowing them to use the tools they  are entitled to under the law \nto accurately demonstrate their skills.  The accommodations available  only on these “optional \nassessments” include spell checkers and four-function calculators for students who are unable to \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n3 \n\n \nperform particular discrete tasks due to specific learning disabilities, such as dyslexia.  These are \nsome of the most common special education accommodations and are used by students every day \nin Alaska public schools to acquire and demonstrate math  or language skills. Students should \nhave access to them on all HSGQE tests, not just an “optional assessment.” \n16.   In  addition, defendants have desig nated  some accommodations as completely  \nunavailable for use on the Exit Exam, and have arbitrarily determined that the very use of these \naccommodations  will  invalidate  a  student’s  entire score, reg ardless  of the use of that \naccommodation in the student’s everyday educational experience.  Defendants classify these \nprohibited accommodations as “modifications,” under the erroneous  reasoning that they alter or \nobscure the entire measurement of a student’s skills.  Defendants have made these designations \nin an arbitrary manner and without acceptable psy chometric or legal justification (including any \ndemonstration that the specific skill supposedly “altered” by a “modification” is actually one that \ncomprises a significant or meaningful test construct).   \n17.   One example of an illegally and arbitrarily prohibited accommodation is the oral \npresentation of test material on the reading  portion of the HSGQE.  W hile oral presentation \nassists a student who cannot read printed words, it does not compromise  the assessment of a \nstudent’s abilities of reading comprehension, vocabulary, or any of the number of other things a \n“reading” test measures.  Nevertheless, a blind student who cannot read B raille – but who is \notherwise fully capable of language comprehension and analysis – will automatically fail the test \nif they use a reader and will be denied a diploma.  Contrary to the discriminatory assumptions \nthat drives this result, a blind student is not stupid, illiterate, or unemployable by virtue of their \ninability to perform the physical act of reading printed words off of a page. \n18.   In addition to the impermissible denial of accommodations by re-labeling them as \n“modifications,” Defendants arbitrarily prohibit the use of any accommodation unless the student \nhas used it at least three months prior to a HSGQE administration.   \n19.   This illegal policy strips IEP teams of their statutory discretion under federal law \nto determine the individualized needs of a particular student with respect to any  educational \nexperience.  If, for example, an IEP team determined ten weeks before a student took her first \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n4 \n\n \nadministration of the HSGQE that she needed an accom modation for that test that she had not \nneeded before, Defendants would deny the student that accommodation.  This denial violates the \n1997 Amendments to IDEA, as well as state law, both of which g uarantee every student’s right \nto all accommodations recommended by the IEP team.  Additionally, the HSGQE operates on a \ncompressed timeline, leaving teachers, students, and I EP teams with no  time to determine and \nimplement HSGQE accommodations in enough time between test administrations to meet the \ndiscriminatory three-month limitation. \n20.   Defendants also have failed to provide adequate, coherent or consistent oversig ht \nand guidance to local school districts and families reg arding the use of accommodations on the \nExit Exam.  As a result, students, parents, and school administrators do not know what process \nshould be followed to request accommodations, or which accommodations are even allowed.  \n21.   For example, the 2002/2003 “Participation Guidelines  For Alaska Students In \nState Assessments” specifically states that use of a g raphing calculator on the math test and \ngrammar checking software are not permissible, purportedly because they are “modifications” \nthat will entirely invalidate a student’s score.  Then, less than two weeks before requests for \n“optional assessment” accommodations were due to the State in December 2003 for the February \n2004 exam administration, this policy was suddenly changed in a memo from Defendant Rog er \nSampson  declaring  that  grammar  checkers and g raphing  calculators  would  be  acceptable \naccommodations on an “optional assessment,” assuming the accommodations were used in the \nclassroom.  This memo was never distributed to families and students with disabilities or the IEP \nteams that serve them, and was distributed only to superintendents, special education directors, \ntest  coordinators,  and  principals.    First,  this amounts to an admission that (1) those \naccommodations  never  really  “modified”  the  test at all (that is to say ,  Defendants cannot \nreasonably argue that one day a graphing calculator compromises test integrity and that the next \nday it does not), and (2) Defendants had been arbitrarily  depriving students of those reasonable \naccommodations for years.  Additionally, this type of last-minute and unpublicized reversal \nleaves IEP teams, students, and parents completely in the dark about acceptable accommodations \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n5 \n\n \nand  illegally  burdens each student’s rig ht  to reasonable  accommodations  on  statewide \nassessments. \n22.   Because many very capable students cannot be fairly  assessed by a standardized \nwritten  test,  Defendants  also  are  required,  under  both federal and state law, to provide an \nalternate means of assessment to the Alaska HSGQE for all students who are unable to access \nstatewide standardized assessments because of phy sical or mental disabilities.  An alternate \nassessment is (1) a mechanism or means, offered as an alternative to the Exit Exam standardized \ntest, of evaluating and measuring a student’s mastery of high school content standards, such as a \nreview of a portfolio of work or revi ew of a collection of teacher evaluations over a period of \ntime, which (2) leads to the same high school diploma that is granted following the inaccessible \nstandardized assessment.  Defendants have failed to comply with this legal requirement.   \n23.   Defendants’ current “alternate assessment” is only available to students (1) with \nthe most severe cognitive and functional disabilities and (2) whose disabilities prevent them from \nmastering high school content standards.  However, many students, with numerous other types of \ndisabilities, are entitled to and should participate in an alternate method of assessment rather than \nthe HSGQE because an alternate assessment is the only method by which these students’ abilities \nand skills can be accurately  measured.  Defendants do not provide an alternative  method of \nevaluation  for those disabled students who, while capable of mastering   State hig h  school \nstandards, are not able to demonstrate their proficiency on a statewide standardized assessment. \n24.   The Exit Exam further discriminates ag ainst students with disabilities because \nthese students have not been prepared by  the Alaska public school sy stem to take the  HSGQE.  \nThroughout  their educations, these students, pursuant to  federal  law,  have  studied  an \nindividualized curriculum set forth in their I EPs or section 504 plans.   However, IEP teams in \nAlaska have not had time to fully  align the content taug ht under individual I EPs with the \nstandard graduation requirements tested by  the HSGQE.  F urthermore, due to  mass confusion \nover which students served by IEPs and 504 plans would be entitled to  diplomas, many special \neducation teams did not know that they  were supposed to desig n IEPs to include Ex it Exam-\naligned content, such as geometry.  In short, in direct contravention of federal and state law, the \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n6 \n\n \nExit Exam unlawfully and unfairly tests these children on material that they  have never been \ntaught.    \n25.  Without  meaningful  access to accommodations (or  alternative  assessments  of \ntheir  achievement),  and without modification of their specializ ed curriculum to include the \nsubject matter being tested, it is a  certainty that the great majority of Alaskan students with \ndisabilities will not be able ever to pass the Exit Exam, no matter how many times the test is \ngiven to them, and therefore will not be able to graduate from high school.   \n26.  In fact, the defects of the Ex it Exam are such that retesting  for students  with \ndisabilities does not result in any materially improved pass rate.   \n27.  By requiring children with disabilities to take discriminatory and unfair tests with \nhigh  stakes  consequences and no m eaningful  access t o  alternate  means  of  assessments, \nDefendants have created a dual track sy stem of public education in which otherwise qualified \nstudents  with  disabilities  will  be  relegated  to the   lower  tier  and  prevented  from  pursuing \nacademic, professional and employment opportunities simply because of their disabilities.  \n28.   In  sum, the Hig h  School Ex it  Exam  discriminates  against  students  with \ndisabilities because, among other problems, (1) there is no meaning ful access to an alternate \nassessment, (2) the accommodations policies illeg ally burden students’ rig hts to use the tools \nnecessary  to de monstrate  their  skills, a nd  (3)  the  Exam  unfairly  tests  disabled  students on \nmaterial they have never been taught.    \n29.   In recognition of these dang ers posed by standardized assessment for students \nwith disabilities, other states have taken and are taking extensive and practical steps to ensure \nthat their statewide assessment systems do not disc riminate against students with disabilities.  \nFor example, Oregon agreed to adopt the recommendations of an ex pert panel commissioned \nunder the terms of a settlement agreement to study Oregon’s testing system.  The panel examined \nwhether Oregon’s high stakes assessment scheme discriminated against students with disabilities \nand recommended that Oregon: (a) develop alternate assessments for disabled students, (b) allow \nextensive accommodations for disabled students, (c) provide comprehensive information and \ntraining to parents, teachers, administrators, and I EP and 504 Plan team members regarding the \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n7 \n\n \nassessment system and participation options for students with disabilities, (d) ensure that the IEP \nand 504 teams individually assess every disabled student to determine how that  student should \nparticipate in the assessment system, (e) institute a problem resolution and appeals process by \nwhich students can appeal decisions regarding accommodation requests and participation in an \nalternate  assessment, and (f) conduct ong oing  research reg arding  accommodations and  the \nvalidity  and  reliability  of  the  assessment  system  for  students  with disabilities.   Alaska  has \ninitiated none of such measures. \n30.   Without immediate relief from the Court, Plaintiff students will be irreparably  \nharmed  in  that  they  will  be  denied numerous academic, professional and employ ment \nopportunities, may not graduate from high school, and will ex perience severe damage to their \nfuture earning capabilities, self-esteem and emotional well-being.   \nTHE PARTIES \n31.   Named Plaintiff ALEXANDER NOON is a public high school student in the class \nof  2004  with  certification  for special education services due to bi-polar disorder, attention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), and dyslexia.

Organizational  Plaintiff  LEARNING  DISABILITIES  ASSOCIATION  OF \nALASKA (“LDAalaska”) is a non-profit nationally  affiliated organization dedicated to helping \nindividuals  with le arning  disabilities,  their  families  and  professionals  through  individual \nempowerment, public education, service and collaborative efforts.  B arriers to students  with \nlearning disabilities are major areas of interest and involvement for  LDA.  The membership of \nLDAalaska includes individuals with learning disabilities, parents and other family members, \neducators, other professionals and concerned citizens.  LDAalaska is dedicated to identifying \ncauses and promoting prevention of learning disabilities, and enhancing the quality of life for all \nindividuals with learning disabilities and their families by encouraging effective identification \nand intervention, fostering research, and protecting their rights under the law.  \n37.   Defendant  ALASKA  STATE B OARD  OF  EDUCATION  AND EARL Y \nDEVLEOPMENT  (“Board”) set s  education  policy,  state  academic  content and performance \nstandards, and puts into action reg ulations governing programs, including public schools, that \noperate under Title 14 of the Alaska Statutes.  The Board is a public entity within the meaning of \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws.  The Board receives \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n9 \n\n \nfederal financial assistance from the United States Department of Education and is therefore \ncovered by the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The B oard is a \nstate educational agency and is therefore covered by the requirements of IDEA. \n38.  Defendant  ROGER SAMPSON is the Alaska Commissioner of Education  & \nEarly Development and is Defendants’ principal ex ecutive officer.  He is being  sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n39.   Defendant  ANCHORAGE SCHOOL  DISTRICT  is a local g overnment  entity \nwithin the meaning of Title II of the ADA, a  recipient of federal financial assistance within the \nmeaning of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and a local educational ag ency covered by \nIDEA.  The Anchorage School District has at least fifty employees.   \n40.   Defendant  RICHARD  SMILEY  is the Administrator of Standards and \nAssessment for the Alaska Department of Education & Early Development.  He is being sued in \nhis official capacity.  \n41.   References in this Complaint to Defendants, unless  otherwise stated, shall be \ndeemed to refer to all defendants, and to each of them. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n42.   Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)  and 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs bring \nthis action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly situated.  The class, which \nthese Plaintiffs represent, is composed of all Alaska public school students with I EPs or Section \n504 plans who have taken or will be required to  take the Alaska High School Graduation \nQualifying Examination.  The class is sometimes hereafter referred to as “Plaintiff students” or \n“Plaintiff children.” \n43.   The persons in the class are so numerous that joinder of all such persons  is \nimpracticable.  There are over forty other students in the Alaska public school system like named \nPlaintiff  Tiana  Lupie  who recei ve  special  education  services  for  visual  impairments,  while \nanother fourteen are both deaf and blind.  Named Plaintiff Doug Mate is just one of 767 students \nin Alaska public schools that are entitled to  special education services for emotional disturbance \ndisabilities.  Named Plaintiffs Alexander Noon, Kendall Leibach, and Irene Takak are just three \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n10 \n\n \nof over 8,000 students statewide that receive special  education services for specific learning \ndisabilities.  In all, there are nearly  18,000 students with  a variety of disabilities who receive \nspecial education services in the Alaska public school sy stem and who must ultimately pass the \nHSGQE in order to obtain a diploma. \n44.   There are numerous issues of fact and questions of law common to the class.   \nThese common factual issues include, but are not limited to, the following: \na.  Defendants’ failure to provide access to a meaningful alternate assessment \nto the HSGQE, leading to a diploma, for all students who need an \nalternative format to demonstrate their mastery of basic skills. \nb.  Defendants’ denial of reasonable accommodations to disabled students by \nutilizing an arbitrary process which re-labels accommodations as \nimpermissible “modifications.” \nc.  Defendants’ denial of reasonable accommodations that have not been used \nat least three months prior to an HSGQE administration. \nd.  Defendants’ failure to provide sufficient guidance to parents and \nadministrators so that students with disabilities have meaningful access to \nthe accommodations they need to succeed on the Exit Exam. \ne.  Defendants’ denial of certain accommodations to students with disabilities \nuntil they have taken and failed one administration of the test. \nf.  Defendants’ development and administration of the Exit Exam, which all \npublic high school students are required to pass to graduate from high \nschool.  \ng.  Defendants’ unfair invalidation of the entire test scores of students with \ndisabilities solely because the students used an accommodation that tests \nonly one of many skills measured by the Exit Exam. \nh.  Defendants’ failure to provide adequate oversight of accommodations \npolicies to ensure uniform and predictable outcomes for all Alaska \nstudents with disabilities. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n11 \n\n \ni.  Defendants’ failure to establish an appeals process by which students can \nappeal denials of accommodations requests.    \nj.  Defendants’ creation of confusion and uncertainty by their failure to \nprovide training and guidance to teachers, administrators, and IEP and 504 \nPlan team members regarding the HSGQE and participation options for \nstudents with disabilities. \nk.  Defendants’ failure to assure that the IEPs or 504 Plans of disabled \nstudents were modified to align with the curriculum tested on the Exit \nExam. \n45.   The common questions of law include, but are not limited to, the following: \na.  Does Defendants’ failure to provide a meaningful alternate assessment to \nthe HSGQE discriminate against Plaintiffs in violation of federal and state \nlaw? \nb.  Does Defendants’ failure to modify disabled students’ IEPs and Section \n504 plans to align with the curriculum tested on the Exit Exam violate \nfederal and state law? \nc.  Does Defendants’ failure to provide meaningful accommodations policies \nconstitute illegal discrimination under federal and state law? \nd.  Does Defendants’ failure to establish any procedure for appealing denials \nof requests for reasonable accommodations violate federal law? \ne.  Is the Exit Exam an invalid test for assessing the knowledge, skills and \nabilities of students with disabilities, in violation of the due process \nprotections of the United States or Alaska Constitution? \nf.  Have students with disabilities been provided with an adequate \nopportunity to learn the material tested on the Exit Exam, as required by \nthe due process protections of the United States Constitution? \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n12 \n\n \n46.   The claims of the named Plaintiffs are ty pical of those of the class, and Plaintiffs \nwill fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.  Plaintiffs have engaged competent \ncounsel to assist them in prosecuting their claims. \n47.   Defendants have acted and refused to act on g rounds generally applicable to the \nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief and/or corresponding  declaratory relief \nwith respect to the class as a whole. \n48.   References herein to “Plaintiffs” shall be deemed to include the named Plaintiffs \nand each member of the class. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n49.   Plaintiffs,  who attend public schools throug hout  Alaska, are students  with \ndisabilities protected by federal law.  There are nearly  18,000 special education students that \nattend Alaska’s public schools and who will be required to pass the Hig h School Graduation \nQualifying Examination in order to graduate from high school beginning this Spring, 2004.  \n50.   By virtue of their disabilities, most students with  disabilities have either a legally \nmandated IEP or a section 504 plan.  These plans are required by  law to be created throug h an \ninteractive process between educators, parents and their children, and are required to specify  a \nchild’s individual needs, including how a student will participate on statewide assessments such \nas the HSGQE.  Some students with disabilities do not have either an IEP or a section 504 plan. \n51.   Students with disabilities span the intellig ence spectrum and many children with \ndisabilities  are  of  very  high  intelligence.   Learning  disabilities  are  the  result  of  permanent \nneurological dysfunction or information processing disruptions that result in limited, unexpected, \nand usually intractable impediments in the ability to learn one or more basic skills taught through \ntraditional formal education.  Many people with learning disabilities work far harder than others \nin order to compensate for their disabilities. \n52.   There are several ty pes of learning disabilities.  Dy slexia, a particular learning \ndisability,  results  from  a  neurological  difference  in processing  phonemes, the basic unit of \nlanguage, and can be seen in brain scans as early as infancy.  Dyslexia impairs the ability to \nprocess language.  A dyslexic individual may have difficulty reading, developing age/grade \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n13 \n\n \nappropriate vocabulary, handwriting, spelling, taking notes, and memorizing rote and sequential \nfacts,  steps and information.  Dy sgraphia,  another specific learning   disability,  is a \nneurocognitive, neuromotor language-based processing disorder often, but not always, associated \nwith dyslexia.  Dysgraphia impairs an individual’s ability to write legibly in a defined space over \na normal timeframe.  Dyscalculia is a mathematical learning disability in which a person has \nsignificant difficulty grasping math concepts and acquiring and retaining math computation and \nproblem solving skills. \n53.   In  addition  to specific learning   disabilities, students with a variety   of other \nphysical and mental disabilities are served by IEPs and section 504 plans.  Students with physical \nand  neurological  disabilities that do not necessarily   affect cog nitive  functioning,  such  as \ndeafness,  low  vision/blindness,  or cerebral palsy ,  often require the support of assistive \ntechnology or human aides/interpreters to acquire and demonstrate lang uage or math skills.  \nSimilarly, students with emotional and mental disabilities, such as autism or bipolar disorder, \nhave special needs in the classroom to ensure that they have the same opportunity as their non-\ndisabled  peers to benefit from a public education.    Named  Plaintiffs  are  representative  of \nstudents throughout Alaska with a variety of disabilities. \n54.  Named  Plaintiff Alex ander  Noon is a disabled  student  with  ADHD,  bi-polar \ndisorder, and dyslexia.  Alexander is in the class of 2004 and attends Service High School in the \nAnchorage School District.  He is required to pass the HSGQE in order to graduate and will have \ncompleted all other diploma requirements by graduation. \n55.  Alexander’s IEP allows him to use the following accommodations: extended time \non writing assignments, assistance with developing/maintaining book and assignment calendar, \nuse of a graphing calculator when appropriate, use of a word processor/AlphaSmart key board to \nwrite, access to teacher or student notes, and taking tests in a small group in a separate location \nwith frequent breaks.  Alexander’s IEP also provides that he may  use special test administrator, \nincluding his teacher.  When Alexander has access to all of these tools, he is fully capable of \ndemonstrating mastery of Alaska high school content standards. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n14 \n\n \n56.  Alexander has never been allowed to use many of his accommodations on the \nHSGQE, even though these accommodations are listed in his I EP and are accommodations he \nuses in the classroom on a regular basis, such as extra time on exams and taking tests in a small \ngroup in a separate location with frequent breaks.  He was not allowed to use a calculator the \nfirst three times he took the HSGQE.  He was allowed to use a calculator on the most recent  test, \nbut he was not allowed to use a graphing calculator as specifically permitted by his IEP (and in \nviolation of Roger Sampson’s directive issued December 8, 2003).  Alex ander and his parents \nwere never given any information on the HSGQE accommodations policies,  such as how to \nrequest specific accommodations or how to appeal accommodations decisions. \n57.  Alexander was forced to seek private tutoring  for math in an effort to pass the \nmath portion of the HSGQE.  Alexander’s IEP team did not make a commitment to tailor his IEP \nto emphasize math skills in preparation for the HSGQE until November 2003, after he had \nalready taken and failed the math portion three times.  Despite recent efforts to learn the math \nskills necessary to pass the HSGQE, Alexander has not had a fair, adequate, or equal opportunity \nto learn the material. \n58.  Named  Plaintiff Kendall L eibach  is a disabled student with  dyslexia,  which \naffects her in the areas of reading, written expression, and math.  She is in the class of 2005 and \nis required to pass the HSGQE in order to obtain a diploma.  Kendall attends  Bartlett High \nSchool in the Anchorage School District.  She currently  has an overall Grade Point Averag e of \n3.516 and is in the top 15% of the students in her class, with a class rank of 45 out  of 360 \nstudents.  She is hoping to graduate summa cum laude next year.   \n59.  Kendall’s  IEP  include  the following   accommodations: ex tended  time for test \ntaking, asking for test direction and question clarification, test taking in a small group setting in a \nseparate location, reading directions out loud, a test administrator who is her teacher, using a four \nfunction calculator, dictionary, thesaurus, and computer with spell checking  software.  Kendall \nrequires these tools for test taking and is able to accurately demonstrate her capabilities when she \nuses them.  Kendall was not allowed to use her calculator on her first HSGQE administration in \n2003.  Kendall’s parents were not g iven any information or g uidelines about the “optional \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n15 \n\n \nassessment” for students with disabilities until after she took an optional assessment (with a \ncalculator, dictionary, and clarified test questions) in October  2003.  They were never given any \ninformation on how to challenge the denial of accommodations. \n60.  Kendall was not prepared for the HSGQE before she was required to take it for \nthe first time in May 2003.  Specifically, the HSGQE tested her on concepts of geometry that she \nhad never been taught.  Since then, Kendall has been enrolled (at her family’s expense) in private \ntutoring classes for reading and geometry to attempt to make up for Defendants’ failure to \nadequately prepare her for the HSGQE.  Although an alternate means of assessing  Kendall’s \nskills may be appropriate, no one has ever provided any  information to Kendall about another \nway of measuring her mastery of state standards. \n61.  Named  Plaintiff  Douglas  Mate  is a public school student with an emotional \ndisturbance disability.  He is in the class of 2004 and must pass the HSGQE in order to obtain a \ndiploma.  He attends Chugiak High School in the Anchorag e School District, and will have \nfulfilled all other diploma requirements by graduation.  Doug’s pre-enlistment in the Army has \nqualified him for a $40,000 scholarship, which he will forfeit if he does not obtain a diploma this \nspring as planned.  His last opportunity to pass the HSGQE was in F ebruary 2004; he will not \nreceive the results until two weeks before graduation. \n62.  Doug’s  IEP  allows  him  to  use  a  calculator for all purposes in his every day \nclassroom setting.  Additionally, his IEP team added a note in November 2003 to his IEP that he \nshould be allowed to use a calculator on the HSGQE.  However, Doug was not allowed to use a \ncalculator at all on the HSGQE until the February 2004 administration, after he had already taken \nand failed the math section three times.  When asked, Anchorage School District officials did not \nknow anything about using a calculator on an “optional assessment,” and Doug ’s mother only \ndiscovered  this  possibility  after  contacting  the  State  Department  of  Education  and  Early \nDevelopment directly. \n63.  Although geometry is one of the areas tested, Doug  had never taken  a geometry \nclass before being forced to take the HSGQE.   Defendants have not provided any remedial \nopportunities  beyond  a Saturday   HSGQE preparation class that  consisted  only  of  taking  a \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n16 \n\n \npractice test on a computer.   Althoug h an alternate means of assessing  Doug’s skills may be \nappropriate, no one has ever provided any information to Doug about another way of measuring \nhis mastery of state standards. \n64.  Named Plaintiff Tiana Katherine L upie is a student in the class of 2005 and  is \nblind.  She maintains a 3.33 grade point average and is an Honor Roll student at Lewis Angapak \nMemorial School in the L ower Kuskokwim School District.  Tiana reads B raille and speaks \nYupik as her native language.  She has not passed the reading and math sections of the HSGQE, \nbut must pass them in order to obtain a high school diploma. \n65.  Tiana’s IEP qualifies her for the following accommodations: extended time in \nboth classroom work and taking tests; taking tests over several short time periods, over several \ndays  if  necessary  to pr event  unwarranted  fatigue  associated  with r eading  Braille;  and  all \nmaterials and supplies adapted to Braille.  Tiana has an assistant with her in the classroom to \nhelp with materials and supplies, to answer questions and to do some tutoring .  Tiana has never \nbeen allowed to break up the reading portion of the test into smaller segments over two days – as \nshe regularly does in her classroom – and has  therefore never been able to complete more than \nhalf of the HSGQE reading  test.  Defendants summarily  denied her  request for this particular \naccommodation with no opportunity for appeal or formal documentation of the denial.  I f Tiana \nwere allowed the testing accommodations she requires to  accurately demonstrate her skills, she \nwould be able to pass the HSGQE and graduate with a diploma. \n66.  Named Plaintiff Irene Takak is a public school student in the class of 2004 with \nspeech and language delays due to a learning disability, which qualify her for special education \nservices by Shaktoolik High School in the Bering Sea School District.  I rene has taken the \nHSGQE four times, but has not yet passed it.  She took it most recently  in February 2004, but \nwill not get her scores until two weeks before graduation.  She must pass all three sections of the \nFebruary 2004 HSGQE in order to obtain a diploma. \n67.  In testing situations other than the HSGQE, I rene is allowed to use  a calculator \nwhere appropriate and to take smaller portions of a test over several days to minimize fatigue \ncaused by her disability.  Irene has never been permitted to use these accommodations that she \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n17 \n\n \nneeds everyday in her classroom to demonstrate her proficiency  in her schoolwork. She has \nnever received any information about taking an optional assessment.  Additionally , her IEP has \nnever been reviewed or updated to ensure that the  individualized curriculum she studies is fully \naligned with the material tested by the HSGQE.  For ex ample, she has never been  taught the \ngraphing skills necessary to pass the math portion.  Although an alternative to the HSGQE may  \nbe more appropriate to measure Irene’s mastery of state content standards, no one has ever told \nher of another way to obtain a diploma other than by  taking the same pen-and-paper test that \nnon-disabled students take.  \nDevelopment of the HSGQE \n68.   In 1997, the Alaska Legislature enacted a law that requires all Alaska high school \nstudents to pass an examination in reading, writing, and mathematics before they can receive a \nhigh school diploma.   Pursuant to this leg islation, the Department of Education and  Early \nDevelopment (“DEED”) contracted CTB/McGraw-Hill in 1998 to create the HSGQE for Alaska, \nwhich was to assess students’ mastery  of the State educational  standards adopted as part of the \nAlaska Quality School Initiative.  The HSGQE was orig inally intended to be a g raduation \nrequirement for students in the class of 2002.   \n69.   With  such a short timeline to create and fully   implement the  HSGQE, \nCTB/McGraw-Hill combined the recently  adopted State education  standards for high school \nstudents with test questions CTB/McGraw-Hill had previously developed for another project to \ncreate the first draft of the Alaska HSGQE.   \n70.   In  March 2000, the state administered the HSGQE for the first time.  Most \nstudents did not receive their score reports from that first administration until over  six months \nlater.  (By that time, there was less than a month  before the first opportunity to retake the test \nduring the beginning of the next school year (2000-2001), forcing students and administrators to \nscramble to prepare students for the nex t retest opportunity without adequate opportunity  to \ndesign and request appropriate accommodations.) \n71.   The results of the first administration were devastating – over 60% of all students \nwho took the test failed.  The leg islature responded to the immediate public controversy  by \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n18 \n\n \nretreating from its original plans and postponing the implementation of the HSGQE  graduation \nrequirement from the class of 2002 until the class of 2004 to allow the exam to be re-worked.    \n72.   Defendants proceeded with implementation of the HSGQE and have administered \nthe exam in Spring and Winter 2003 and February 2004 to all high school students beginning in \ntenth grade.  These students, which include members of the class of 2004, are required to pass \nthe HSGQE in order to g raduate from high school.  Recently , Defendants announced that  the \nstatewide assessment contract has just been awarded to a different corporation, Data Recognition \nCorporation.  While Defendants will still use the test developed by  CTB/McGraw-Hill for the \nfall 2004 and spring 2005 administrations, a totally new test will be implemented after that time, \ninjecting  yet  another layer  of confusion reg arding  the  alignment  of  school  coursework  and \navailability of accommodations and alternate assessments. \n73.   Based  on prior ex perience  in Alaska and early   test scores, unless the  Court \nintervenes, it is likely that over two-thirds of otherwise qualified students with disabilities in the \nclass of 2004 will not receive a diploma, with devastating lasting effects on their lives.    \n74.   Defendants  are fully   aware that the failure to take steps to  maximize  the \nparticipation of special education students has resulted in an Exit Exam that discriminates against \nstudents with disabilities.  The Exit Exam discriminates against students with disabilities in at \nleast the following multiple ways. \nAlternate Assessment \n75.   Defendants failed to develop an “alternate assessment” to the Alaska HSGQE, \nwhich leads to a standard diploma, as is required by IDEA. \n76.   IDEA  was amended in 1997 to require all states to develop and  implement \n“alternate  assessments”  that  have t he  same  outcomes  (such  as  grade  advancement,  district \nranking, or high school graduation) as any regular statewide assessment administered by  the \nState.  Alternate assessments are required for any student with a disability who is una ble to \nparticipate in the standard assessment by virtue of his or her disability, including students who \ncan  master hig h  school lang uage  and math skills but cannot demonstrate them in  a timed \nstandardized test format.  The requirement to provide an alternative  means of measuring a \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n19 \n\n \nstudent’s mastery of high school content is essential to allowing  students with disabilities an \nequal opportunity with respect to statewide assessments such as the Alaska HSGQE.   \n77.  Under these 1997 amendments, alternate assessments were to be in place by  July \nof 2000.   See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(17)(A); 34 C.F .R. § 300.138.  Defendants have  been and \nremain fully aware of their legal obligation to develop alternate assessments to the HSGQE.   \n78.   However, Defendants ignored this legal obligation and refused to develop an \nalternate assessment to the HSGQE for students who are capable of mastering  high school \ngraduation standards but who cannot access a standardiz ed test.  Instead, Defendants require all \nstudents to take the same pen-and-paper test in order to obtain a diploma.  \n79.   The so-called “optional assessment,” offered by  defendants, is not an  alternative \nformat or alternative assessment method that leads to the same outcomes for the student.  Rather, \nit is the exact same pen-and-paper test that all students take, administered with a few of the most \nstandard accommodations in special education that Defendants arbitrarily prohibit on the regular \nHSGQE.   \n80.   The Alaska “alternate assessment” also is not an alternative means of measuring a \nstudent’s mastery of high school content as contemplated  by the 1997 amendments to IDEA.  \nThe HSGQE “alternate assessment” does not lead to a diploma and is designed only for severely \ndisabled students who cannot be expected to meet high school graduation standards in the first \nplace. \n81.  At  the December 2003 meeting   of the S tate  Board  of  Education  and  Early \nDevelopment,  Roger  Sampson  recommended  that  the B oard  adopt an alternate assessment \nprogram that is truly an alternate format to the standardized HSGQE.  This pr ogram would \nrequire that a student (1) have an I EP or 504 plan that requires and alternative  assessment \nprogram and (2) take and fail the standard HSGQE first.  However, the B oard rejected this \nrecommendation and instead adopted an alternative recommendation that students have access \nonly to an “optional assessment” – that is, the same pen-and-paper HSGQE  but with other \naccommodations listed in the student’s IEP.  Again, this contributed to the mass confusion \nsurrounding  the  HSGQE,  as  people  were unclear if this was really   any  different from the \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n20 \n\n \nprevious policy.  Additionally, it is unc lear what the policy even means or if it has ever been \ncommunicated to students.  F inally, this demonstrates that the B oard of Education  and Early \nDevelopment did not even adopt final regulations to govern the “optional  assessments” until \nDecember 2003, leaving students and administrators without adequate reg ulatory guidance for \nyears of high stakes test administrations, and effectively giving students with disabilities just one \nchance to take and pass the Exit Exam with a finalized regulatory framework in February 2004. \n82.  To add to the confusion, Defendants have adopted reg ulations under which a \nstudent with a disability can get a diploma without taking the HSGQE if the  student (1) was in \nthe 9th grade or higher in the Alaska public schools during  the 2002-03 school y ear and (2) \nsuccessfully completed an alternate assessment program required by his/her IEP.  This exception \nto the HSGQE graduation requirement and the standard alternate assessment policy was adopted \nbecause previously, the DEED had sai d that students could demonstrate their mastery of high \nschool standards and receive diplomas through completing alternate assessments identified in the \na student’s IEP.  However, the Attorney General stated last fall (2003) that the DEED was \nmisinterpreting the regulations and reversed the rule, stating that alternate assessments could not \nlead to standard diplomas.  Defendants implemented the new regulations as a compromise with \nall of the students and parents who had reasonably relied on the old regulations and had worked \nto implement alternate assessments that would lead to a diploma.  However, this compromise \nindicates that Defendants (1) continue to fuel the mass  confusion over the implementation of the \nHSGQE by constantly and arbitrarily revising the procedures that students rely upon to graduate \nfrom high school and (2) overtly recognize the necessity of individualized alternate assessments \nthat qualify students for regular high school diplomas. \n83.   By failing and refusing to develop and provide a meaningful alternative means of \nmeasuring a student’s mastery of high school materials for students with disabilities who require \none (regardless of the type or nature of the disability), Defendants are discriminating against all \nAlaska students with disabilities for whom an alternate assessment, rather than the standardized \nExit Exam, is appropriate.  These students will not be properly assessed by the HSGQE, and will \nnot be able to accurately demonstrate their knowledge, skills and abilities. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n21 \n\n \nReasonable Accommodations \n84.   In order to minimize the unfair effects of their disabilities on standardiz ed tests, \nPlaintiff  students  require  and  are g uaranteed  under federal and state law reasonable \naccommodations on the HSGQE.  \n85.   Without  such accommodations, Plaintiff students will be tested  on  their \ndisabilities instead of their abilities and are subjected to discrimination on the basis of their \ndisabilities.  Without the use of reasonable accommodations on the Ex am, Plaintiffs will be \nunable to pass the Exam and therefore will be unable to graduate from high school. \n86.   Defendants  have created chaos and confusion by   failing  to formulate clear \npolicies and procedures regarding the provision of reasonable accommodations on the Alaska \nHigh School Graduation Qualifying Examination.  This failure has led to ad  hoc policymaking \nby  Defendants,  resulting  in c onflicting  and  sometimes  mutually  exclusive  “policies”  and \n“procedures.”   \n87.   Defendants’ current policies and regulations regarding access to accommodations \non the HSGQE are deficient and discriminatory in numerous ways.   \n88.   The  regulations  promulgated  by  Defendants are illeg al  and discriminatory  \nbecause they do not allow students with disabilities to use  an accommodation on the Exit Exam \nthat they may need, but that is not listed in their I EP or 504 Plan, or that they  have not used for \nthe past three months during instruction and classroom assessments.  Because of t he different \nnature of the Ex it Exam, as compared to  classroom education, many students with disabilities \nmay require accommodations on the Exit Exam that they may not have previously required for \nclassroom assessments. \n89.   The regulations are also discriminatory because they do not allow for a disabled \nstudent who does not have an IEP or 504 plan to use accommodations on the Exit Exam.  While \nthe majority of students eligible for accommodations are those with an IEP or a section 504 plan, \nthere are students with disabilities who do not have either an I EP or a section 504 plan who will \nneed accommodations on the Exit Exam.  Other states, such as Massachusetts, have recognized \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n22 \n\n \nthis and explicitly provide in their regulations that disabled students who do not ha ve IEPs or \nsection 504 plans may request accommodations on statewide assessments.  \n90.   In  addition, Defendants’ policies do not provide for any   clear procedure  for \nstudents to request accommodations on the Exit Exam, and therefore students, parents, and \nadministrators do not know what process is available for requesting  accommodations, or what \nstandards are used in reviewing and granting these accommodation requests.  \n91.   The  method  by  which the Ex it  Exam  would be administered with \naccommodations was defined – in a secret and unaccountable process –  by a single individual, \nDefendant Richard Smiley.  No opportunity  was made available to provide public input or to \nappeal Defendants’ “allowable accommodations” designations.   \n92.   The only means of applying for accommodations or an optional assessment is \nthrough Richard Smiley, and his method of g ranting or denying accommodations or an optional \nassessment is standardless and discretionary .  His determination of which  common classroom \nspecial education tools would be appropriate accommodations or impermissible “modifications” \nwas  similarly  arbitrary  and  unfounded.   His ad hoc formulation and administration of the \naccommodations policies and optional assessment has left students with disabilities, parents, and \nspecial educators vulnerable to arbitrary and unpredictable results. \n93.  Under  Defendants’ arbitrary   and defective accommodations/modifications \npolicies, the invalidation of an entire test score because the student uses an accommodation that \nassists with just one of the many skills measured by a test is discriminatory based solely on the \nstudent’s disability.  For example, the HSGQE reading test measures many different skills, or \n“domains,”  associated with reading ,  including  the ability   to understand  printed  language \n(referred  to as “decoding ”),  reading  comprehension, vocabulary ,  etc.  Oral presentation of \nmaterial, which is a prohibited “modification” for the HSGQE, only  compensates for one such \ndomain  – a   student’s  ability  to de code  printed  language.   I t  does  not  compromise  the \nmeasurement of the student’s ability to draw inferences, understand vocabulary and composition \nof  sentences,  or  any  of  the  other  skills te sted  by  reading  tests.    However,  students  with \ndisabilities are denied any credit for their abilities to demonstrate these other skills because their \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n23 \n\n \nperformance is completely invalidated due to the use of an accommodation for a totally different \ntest domain. \n94.   The regulations do not provide for any  appeals of denials  of accommodation \nrequests.  Thus, regardless of how arbitrary or incorrect a denial of an accommodation request is, \na student has no standards-driven process to appeal that denial.   \n95.   Defendants have failed to provide mechanisms, procedures,  policies or personnel \nto  engage  in the leg ally  required process with  parents  and  students  for  the  fashioning  of \nreasonable accommodations.  Defendants have not provided adequate training or information to \nschools and school districts regarding the individualized assessment necessary to determine what \naccommodations a disabled student will require on the Exit Exam.   \n96.  Confusion  regarding  the means of  requesting  accommodations  or  optional \nassessments  is  pervasive and undermines students’ abilities to access the learning   tools \nguaranteed to them by federal law.  Due to the lack of clear policies and procedures regarding \nobtaining accommodations on the Exit Exam, parents of Plaintiff students have been (1) unable \nto make informed decisions about how their child should prepare for or take the tests, (2) misled \nabout  the procedures and consequences, (3) forced to  make  decisions  which  may  be \nunnecessarily  damaging  to the ir  children’s  future,  (4)  unable to participate meaningfully in \ndesigning  Plaintiffs’  IEPs  or section 504 plans, and/or (5) discourag ed from requesting the \nreasonable accommodations and alternate assessments to which they  are entitled by  state and \nfederal law. \n97.  Although  Defendants have stated that students will be provided  reasonable \naccommodations in accordance with their I EPs or section 504 plans, this has not occurred.   In \nmany instances, the issue of reasonable accommodations on the Alaska HSGQE was not even \naddressed at the student’s IEP or section 504 meeting.  In other instances, although the issue of \nreasonable accommodations on the Exit Exam may have been di scussed at a student’s IEP or \nsection  504  plan  meeting,  parents  of  Plaintiff children were nevertheless unable to make \ninformed choices regarding their child’s education because school officials did not know what \nthe policies and procedures were regarding reasonable accommodations on the Exit Exam.   \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n24 \n\n \n98.  At various times, various school officials have made the following representations \nto parents of Plaintiff children regarding requested accommodations: \na.  The head of special education at Doug Mate’s school in the Anchorage \nSchool District had no idea that students with disabilities could take the \nHSGQE with a calculator on an “optional assessment.” \nb.  Staff at Kendall Leibach’s school in the Anchorage School District told \nher that she could not use any accommodations the first time she took the \nHSGQE in 2003.   The special education department chair told her mother \nthat a student had to fail before accommodations could be provided. \nc.  When Tiana Lupie’s IEP team requested that she be allowed to take the \ntest over several days, the request had to be made verbally to the District \nTest Coordinator, because there were no procedures available for \nrequesting them in writing.  When the IEP team’s request was rejected \n(again, verbally), they were told that there was no opportunity for appeal \nin light of Tiana’s special circumstances.  \n99.  Finally,  even  if  parents  and IEP  teams manag ed  to properly  reserve specific \naccommodations for a st udent’s test, Defendants have failed to provide adequate oversight of \naccommodations to ensure the accommodations are implemented fairly or consistently.  For \nexample, Defendants have failed to ensure the presence  of an adequate number of proctors for \nindividualized settings.  In Ketchikan, several students with disabilities typed their HSGQE \nresponse on computers and then taped the printed answers into the exam booklets.  Inexplicably, \nhalf of those exams were graded, while the other half was not g raded.  This is emblematic of \nsystemically inadequate oversight and administration that violates students’  right to reasonable \naccommodations on all statewide assessments. \nLack of Validity \n100.  The HSGQE also discriminates ag ainst students with disabilities  because they \nhave not had an opportunity to learn the material tested by  the HSGQE.  Throug hout their \neducations, Plaintiff students have been provi ded with specific courses of study in accordance \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n25 \n\n \nwith their IEPs or section 504 plans that in many  cases deviate from the general curriculum.  \nThese IEPs and 504 plans have not been modified to align with the subject matter tested on the \nHSGQE, and as a consequence t he test lacks curricular validity for students with disabilities.  \nFurther, because students have not actually been exposed to the material tested by the HSGQE, it \nalso lacks instructional validity.  The process of modify ing IEPs and section 504 plans to align \nwith the material tested on the Exit Exam can be lengthy and may require a lead time of many \nyears.   \n101.  Despite  the  fact that Defendants have already   implemented the HSGQE, \nDefendants have not taken adequate steps to ensure  that Plaintiffs’ IEPs and section 504 plans \nare  modified to alig n  with the Ex am.   In  addition, widespread confusion reg arding  which \nstudents with disabilities would be able to take the HSGQE and receive a diploma left many  IEP \nteams unaware that they  were supposed to alig n a student’s education plan with the content \ntested by the HSGQE.  Because t hese IEP teams learned so late – if ever – t hat the student \nneeded to be offered specific materials in preparation for the HSGQE, these students are unfairly \nand illegally disadvantaged in their efforts to master and demonstrate high school competency. \n102.  A paper prepared by researchers at the Anchorage School District for presentation \nat  the 2001 American Educational Research Association Convention admitted that the  low \npassing rates on the math portion of the HSGQE indicated the test’s lack of validity as a \nminimum competency test.  The paper also admitted that the HSGQE implementation process \ndid not make any close examination of external validity through the examination of instruction \nand actual learning.  Defendants made no effort to establish the  extent to which students are \ngetting the direct instruction needed in the standards areas to prepare them to answer the specific \nitems included in the tests.    \n103.  The results of the paper indicated that, particularly in the area of math, teachers \ndid not report substantial levels of opportunity  to learn the materials tested by  the HSGQE.  In \nfact, while the math portion tests a total of 27 different standards, 20 percent or more of  the \nteachers surveyed for the paper admitted that they  had given little or no emphasis to each of \nthose areas.  Thirteen of the 27 math standards had more than 40 percent of the teachers saying \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n26 \n\n \nthat no emphasis was given to the standard.  Four of the 27 standards had more  than 50 percent \nof the teachers saying no emphasis was given to the standard. \n104.  The authors of that study concluded: \n[T]he high failure rates, the lack of evidence that standards align with \ninstruction, the questionable results from Opportunity to Learn Studies, \nthe high initial failure rate on the test,  and the poor performance of \nAnchorage  students who have known success  in  course  work,  and \nevidence  of  bet ter-than-average  performance  on  a  national  norm \nreferenced test all raise questions about the fairness and validity of the \ntest scores.  Similarly , the gross differences in performance of  non-\nEnglish speaking students and special education students raise questions \nabout Opportunity to Learn and the Alaska  assertion that all students \nshould meet the standards embodied in the HSGQE. \n \n105.  In  a recent state-by -state  survey  by  a  leading  national  education  newspaper, \nEducation Week, Alaska received the lowest grade of any state this year for efforts to improve \nteacher quality.  Alaska ranked 43rd out of the 50 states in the survey ’s adequacy of school \nresources index.  Alaska was last in the nation for having  the widest variation in per  pupil \nspending  across districts, indicating   an imbalanced  distribution  of  educational  resources.  \nStandardized statewide high stakes assessment is fundamentally unfair where the opportunities to \nreceive instruction on the test material are so uneven, particularly for students with disabilities \nwho receive individualized instruction. \n106.  Defendants have not taken adequate steps  to ensure appropriate remediation for \ndisabled students who do not pass the Exit Exam on their first attempt.   \n107.  Without immediate relief from the Court, Plaintiffs will be irreparably  harmed in \nthat they will be denied numerous academic, employ ment and professional opportunities, may  \nnot graduate from high school, and will ex perience severe damage to their self-esteem and \nemotional well-being.  \nFIRST CLAIM \n(Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n108.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n107 inclusive. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n27 \n\n \n109.  Defendants’ acts and omissions alleg ed herein are in violation of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., (“ADA”) and the reg ulations promulgated \nhereunder, 28 C.F.R. Part 35, et seq.  \n110.  Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning  of the \nADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n111.  Defendants  ALASKA  STATE B OARD  OF  EDUCATION  AND  EARLY \nDEVELOPMENT  and ANCHORAGE SCHOOL   DISTRICT  are public entities  within  the \nmeaning of Title I I of the ADA and the reg ulations promulgated thereunder.  42  U.S.C. § \n12131(1)(B).   \n112.  In violation of the ADA, Defendants have failed to  evaluate their policies and \npractices to ensure that these policies and procedures do not exclude or limit the participation of \nindividuals with disabilities in their programs and activities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.105.  \n113.  In  violation  of the ADA, Defendants have refused to develop and provide \nalternate assessments to those Plaintiffs who require an alternate assessment by virtue of their \ndisability.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130. \n114.  In  violation of the ADA, Defendants  have  excluded  Plaintiff  children  from \nparticipation in and denied them the benefits of the services, prog rams or activities of a public \nentity solely on the basis of disability .  Defendants have further violated the ADA by  otherwise \nsubjecting Plaintiff children to discrimination based upon disability .  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(a). \n115.  Defendants have violated the ADA by denying Plaintiff children the opportunity \nto participate in or benefit from aids, benefits and services provided by the public entities, and by \nproviding Plaintiff children with the opportunity to participate in or benefit from aids, benefits or \nservices that are not equal to those afforded non-disabled children who attend Alaska’s  public \nschools.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i)-(ii). \n116.  Defendants have violated the ADA by providing Plaintiff children with benefits \nthat are different and/or not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same results, \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n28 \n\n \nto gain the same benefits, or to reach the same levels of achievement as that provided to others.  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii)(iv).   \n117.  Defendants  have violated the ADA by   utilizing  criteria or methods of \nadministration that have the effect of subjecting Plaintiff children to discrimination on the basis \nof  disability  or  that  have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing \naccomplishment of the objectives of the public entity ’s program with respect to individuals with \ndisabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n118.  Defendants have violated the ADA by administering a certification program in a \nmanner that subjects Plaintiff children to discrimination on the basis of disability.  28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b)(6). \n119.  Defendants have violated the ADA by failing to make reasonable modifications in \npolicies, practices or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on \nthe basis of disability.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(7). \n120.  Defendants  have  violated  the  ADA  by  imposing  eligibility  requirements that \nscreen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of individuals with \ndisabilities  from  fully  and  equally  enjoying  any  service,  program,  or  activity  offered  by \nDefendants.  28 C.F.R. § 130.(b)(8).   \n121.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nSECOND CLAIM \n(Violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq.) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n122.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n121 inclusive. \n123.  Plaintiffs  are qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning   the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973. \n124.  Defendants  ALASKA  STATE B OARD  OF  EDUCATION  AND  EARLY \nDEVELOPMENT and ANCHORAGE SCHOOL DISTRICT are the recipients  of federal funds \nsufficient to invoke the coverage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n29 \n\n \n125.  Defendants have intentionally discriminated against Plaintiffs on the basis of their \ndisabilities in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.  29 U.S.C. § 794. \n126.  Solely by reason of their disabilities, Plaintiffs have been,  and continue to be, \nexcluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, and subjected to discrimination in their \nattempts to receive, full and equal access to the prog rams, services and activities offered by  \nDefendants in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.  29 U.S.C. § 794.      \n127.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nTHIRD CLAIM \n(Violation of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq.) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n128.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n127 inclusive. \n129.  Defendants have violated IDEA by failing to develop adequate regulations for the \nprovision of appropriate accommodations to students with disabilities on the Alaska High School \nGraduation Qualifying Exam.  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(17)(A). \n130.  Defendants  have  violated I DEA  by  failing  to develop g uidelines  for the \nparticipation of children with disabilities in alternate assessments for those disabled students who \ncannot participate in the Hig h School Exit Exam but who can still master  Alaska state high \nschool content standards.  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(17)(A)(I).   \n131.  Defendants have violated I DEA by not ensuring that the Alaska Hig h School \nGraduation Qualifying Exam has been validated for the specific purpose for which it is used.   20 \nU.S.C. § 1414(b)(3)(B)(I).   \n132.  Defendants  have adopted a policy   of  discrimination  based  solely  upon  the \ndisabilities of school children, resulting in severe interference with and deprivation of Plaintiffs’ \nfundamental right to a free and appropriate public education, which  is secured to them by the \nlaws of the United States and specifically pursuant to IDEA.  20 U.S.C. § 1401(8).  \n133.  No  administrative  remedy  exists under IDEA to address these wholesale and \nstatewide violations by Defendants.  According ly, Plaintiffs are not required to ex haust the \nadministrative procedures set forth in IDEA.  \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n30 \n\n \n134.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nFOURTH CLAIM \n(Violation of Due Process Clause of United States Constitution) \n(Against Defendants Roger Sampson, Richard Smiley, and the Anchorage School District) \n \n135.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through 134 \ninclusive. \n136.  The actions of Defendants have violated and continue to violate the F ourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution in that Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs \nand their parents with adequate notice of the testing requirements for the Exit Exam.  Due to \nwidespread confusion and a systemic lack of adequate notice, parents and educators have not had \nsufficient time to consider and determine whether and how the skills tested on the statewide tests \nshould be addressed in a child’s IEP or Section 504 Plan.  Alaska schools have never taug ht or \ntrained children with disabilities many of the skills and content currently being tested on the \nAlaska High School Graduation Qualifying Examination.  Defendants have taken no steps to \nensure  that  disabled  students’ I EPs  or Section 504 Plans are modified to alig n  with the \ncurriculum and skills tested on the Exit Exam.  Instead, Defendants have embarked upon a one-\ntest-fits-all,  test-first-provide-education-later  procedure  without conducting   adequate research \ninto the far-reaching consequences for students with disabilities, which effectively  makes it \nimpossible for these students to pass the required exams. \n137.  The actions of Defendants have violated and continue to violate the F ourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution because the Exit Exam, as currently formulated \nand administered, lacks both instructional and curricular validity , and has not been shown to  be \nvalid for students with disabilities.  \n138.  Defendants have violated and continue to violate the F ourteenth Amendment to \nthe  United  States  Constitution by   failing  to c reate  and  implement  clear,  consistent  and \nunderstandable policies and procedures reg arding provision of reasonable accommodations on \nthe Exit Exam.  Defendants have violated the F ourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution by formulating arbitrary accommodations guidelines in a secret and unaccountable \nprocess without any psychometric justification whatsoever. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n31 \n\n \n139.  Defendants have violated and continue to violate the F ourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution by failing to establish a formal procedure for parents and students \nto  challenge  even the most arbitrary   conduct with reg ard  to the denials of  reasonable \naccommodations on the Alaska High School Graduation Qualifying Examination. \n140.  The actions of Defendants have violated and continue to violate the F ourteenth \nAmendment  to  the United States Constitution in that the HSGQE is fundamentally   unfair \nbecause many students with disabilities will not be accurately assessed by the Exit Exam because \nthey require an alternate assessment.  Defendants have refused, in violation of  federal law, to \ndevelop a meaningful alternate assessment to the Alaska Hig h School Graduation Qualify ing \nExamination.   \n141.  Moreover, because the HSGQE lacks curricular validity in that it tests materials \nthat students with disabilities have not had the opportunity  to learn, it is not  even rationally \nrelated to any legitimate state interest.  See Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397, 406 (5th Cir. \n1981). \n142.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nFIFTH CLAIM \n(Declaratory Relief, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n143.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n142 inclusive. \n144.  Plaintiffs contend, and are informed and believe that Defendants deny  that the \nALASKA  STATE  BOARD  OF  EDUCATION  has failed to comply   with applicable law \nprohibiting discrimination against persons with disabilities and is in violation of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101,  et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq.; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the United States \nConstitution. \n145.  A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that each \nof the parties may know his or her respective rights and duties and act accordingly. \n146.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n32 \n\n \nSIXTH CLAIM \n(Alaska Statutes § 14.03.075) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n147.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n146 inclusive. \n148.  The Alaska statute that creates the Hig h School Graduation Qualify ing Exam \nrequires  the  administration  of  an  “alternative  assessment  program.”   Ala ska  Stat.  § \n14.03.075(c)(1).  Students that successfully complete the alternative assessment  program are \neligible to receive a standard high school diploma upon graduation. \n149.  Defendants  violate  this  provision by   administering  an “optional assessment,” \nwhich (1) is not a “program” as required by the statute and amounts to the ex act same pen-and-\npaper test everyone else takes with five additional standard accommodations, and (2) does not  \ncomply with the statutory intent to comply with the alternative assessment provisions of the 1997 \nAmendments to IDEA. \n150.  Furthermore,  in  violation  of  this  statute, the “alternate assessments” that \nDefendants provide to students with disabilities (1) are available only to students with the most \nsevere cognitive disabilities who are not ex pected to master the State’s  high school content \nstandards, and (2) do not lead to a standard high school diploma. \n151.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nSEVENTH CLAIM \n(Alaska Administrative Code, Title 4, § 06.775) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n152.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n151 inclusive. \n153.  The regulations promulgated by Defendants to implement the HSGQE  require \nthat a student be allowed to use all “accommodations required in a student’s I EP or section 504 \nplan for every required standards based or norm referenced test.”  4 AAC § 06.775(a)(1). \n154.  In  violation  of  this reg ulatory  provision, Defendants prohibit students from \naccessing the full range of accommodations that may be recommended by an IEP team or section \n504 plan including, but not limited to, a blanket prohibition against extended time to take a test \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n33 \n\n \nbeyond one day, oral presentation of the reading test, and any accommodation that was added to \nan IEP within the three months preceding an HSGQE administration.  These illegal and arbitrary \nrestrictions and burdens on st udents’ right to their reasonable accommodations were devised in \nsecret without any articulated justification beyond the subjective beliefs of state bureaucrats. \n155.  Additionally, Defendants force students to take the HSGQE  once without certain \naccommodations – such as spell checkers and four funct ion calculators, which are among the \nmost commonly recommended accommodations in special education – before allowing them to \nuse the accommodations on an “opt ional assessment,” thereby burdening and violating each \nstudent’s state right to every accommodation recommended by an IEP or section 504 plan. \n156.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nEIGHTH CLAIM \n(Alaska Human Rights Act, Alaska Stat. §§ 18.80.200 et seq.) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n157.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n156 inclusive. \n158.  The Alaska public schools, as places offering educational services to the g eneral \npublic, are public accommodations that must offer their services and privileg es without regard to \nphysical or mental disability.  Alaska Stat. § 18.80.230. \n159.  Defendants  violate  state  law by   burdening  and violating   Plaintiffs’ rig hts  to \nreasonable accommodations and a m eaningful alternate assessment for statewide assessments \nbecause  of  students’  physical  or mental disabilities.  Defendants’ denial of appropriate \neducational  opportunities  to  prepare for the HSGQE because Plaintiffs are served by  \nindividualized curriculums is also an illeg al and discriminatory denial of Defendants’ public \nservices based solely upon disability. \n160.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nNINTH CLAIM \n(Violation of Equal Protection Clause of Alaska Constitution) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n161.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n160 inclusive. \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n34 \n\n \n162.  The Alaska Constitution guarantees all children of Alaska a rig ht to a public \neducation.  Alaska Const., Art. 7, § 1;  Hootch v. Alaska State-Operated Sch. System , 536 P.2d \n793, 799 (Alaska 1975). \n163.  Defendants are agencies of the State of Alaska and the conduct attributable  to \nDefendants amounts to state action.  Defendants are oblig ated to extend equal rights, protection, \nand opportunities to all residents of Alaska.  Alaska Const., Art. 1, §  1.  The Alaska equal \nprotection and due process provisions provide broader protections than the federal constitutional \ncounterparts.  Burnor v. State, 829 P.2d 837 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992). \n164.  Defendants have violated and continue to  violate the Equal Protection provisions \nof the Alaska Constitution by failing to ensure that plaintiff students with disabilities have an \nequal  opportunity  as nondisabled students to demonstrate mastery   of the content  standards \naddressed  in  the  HSGQE  through  use of reasonabl e  accommodations  and/or  an al ternate \nassessment. \n165.  Disabled students in this year’s senior class who were retested in the spring  of \n2003 – without an appropriate policy  for reasonable accommodations or a  meaningful alternate \nassessment in place – failed the writing section at a rate of 77% and the math section at a rate of \n82%.  These rates are compared to a failure rate on the writing section of 50% and on the math \nsection of 63% for all Alaska public school students who retook the HSGQE in  the spring of \n2003, including students with disabilities. \n166.  Unless  student Plaintiffs are provided with  appropriate  reasonable \naccommodations and/or an alternate assessment, students with disabilities will continue to fail \nthe HSGQE in disproportionate numbers, and thus will be deprived of the opportunity to obtain a \nhigh school diploma. \n167.  These  inequalities in opportunity   and preparation do not further  the  State’s \ninterest in ensuring a standards-based secondary  education for all students where (1)  disabled \nstudents are capable of mastering  high school standards but (2) are limited in their ability  to \ndemonstrate this mastery on a standardized test with or without accommodations.  As means of \npursuing the legislative objective of statewide assessment, Defendants’ legally deficient and \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n35 \n\n \neducationally unsound accommodations, alternate assessment, and curriculum alignment policies \ndo not afford Plaintiffs an equal opportunity meet state education standards. \n168.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nTENTH CLAIM \n(Violation of Due Process Clause of Alaska Constitution) \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n169.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the alleg ations in paragraphs 1 through \n168 inclusive. \n170.  Both the Alaska Constitution, Article I section 7, and the 14th amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution prohibit the State from depriving any person of “life, liberty, or \nproperty, without due process of law.”   Bush v. Reid, 516 P.2d 1215, 1217 n.9 (Alaska 1973).   \nWhile the protections of the Alaska Due Process Clause are broader than the 14th Amendment, \nDefendants  violate  the  Alaska  Constitution f or  the  same  reasons  they  violate  the  federal \nConstitution.  See ¶¶ 135-42, supra. \n171.  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows: \n1.  A determination by this Court that this action may be maintained as a class action. \n2.  The  issuance  of  a declaratory   judgment  that Defendants have violated the \nIndividuals  with Disa bilities  Education  Act;  the  Americans  with Disa bilities  Act;  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973; the United States Constitution; Alaska Statutes  and Alaska Code of \nRegulations; and the Alaska Constitution. \n3.  The issuance of an injunction restraining  Defendants from making the HSGQE a \ncondition of graduation unless and until Defendants have developed and provided alternate \nassessments to all disabled students who require such an assessment (not just those with severe \ncognitive disabilities who cannot master state standards); issued and publicized clear regulations \nand  establish a procedure by   which students and their parents can request reasonable \naccommodations on the Exit Exam, as well as a standard for consideration and granting of such \nrequests; establish an appeals process by which students can appeal denials of accommodations \n \nDisabled v. Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development \nComplaint \n36 \n\n \nrequests; and taken all steps necessary to ensure that the Hig h School Graduation Qualify ing \nExam is valid and reliable for students with disabilities. \n4.  Retention of jurisdiction by this Court until such time as the Court is satisfied that \nDefendants’ unlawful policies, practices, acts, and omissions complained of herein have been \nremedied and will not recur. \n5.  An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.   \n6.  Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \nDATED:          Re spectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n      B y:   _______________________________ \nSID WOLINSKY  \nDISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATES \n449 15th Street, Suite 303 \nOakland, California 94612 \n(510) 451-8644 (t) \n(510) 451-8511 (f) \n(510) 451-8716 (TTY) \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________________ \nDAVID W.

      "text": "Commissioner Roger Sampson \nDepartment of Education \n& Early Development \n801 W. Tenth Street, Suite 200 \nJuneau, Alaska 99801-1894 \nwww.eed.state.ak.us \n \n \nDate: April 7, 2004 \n \n \n \nN • E (cid:127) W (cid:127) S   R (cid:127) E (cid:127) L (cid:127) E (cid:127) A (cid:127) S (cid:127) E  \n \nMore information Harry Gamble, Information Officer, 465-2851 \n \nState Enters Stipulation In Disabilities Class Action Lawsuit \nStudents with Disabilities Can Get Diplomas in 2004 Without Passing Exit Exam  \nAttorney General Gregg Renkes and Education Commissioner Roger Sampson announced the filing of a joint \nstipulation today in U.S. District Court that would allow students with disabilities in the Class of 2004 to get a \ndiploma without passing the state’s high school exit exam. The stipulation was based on an agreement by the State \nof Alaska and the lawyers who filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court. \nAs many as 500 high school seniors with disabilities have not passed all three parts of the high school exam – \nreading, writing and math. Under the injunction, the students still need to complete all other state and district \ngraduation requirements. About 800 seniors have disabilities. \nThe lawsuit was filed March 16 against the State Board of Education & Early Development, two Department of \nEducation & Early Development officials and the Anchorage School District. \n “We have stated from the outset that we have concerns any time the State Board and Department of Education & \nEarly Development are implicated in treating students unfairly,” said Education Commissioner Roger Sampson. \n“Our aim is exactly the opposite. We are working to provide a top rate education for each and every child in the state \nand to help them make a successful transition to life after graduation.” Sampson added: “The agreement with the \nplaintiffs will allow both sides to negotiate in good faith the issues raised in the suit to reach a resolution that is fair \nfor all involved.” \nSampson and Attorney General Gregg Renkes said the stipulation will provide time for the State to seek guidance \nfrom the Legislature and the State Board of Education regarding options for settling the lawsuit. \"We need to know \nwhether the legislature will act on pending legislation affecting this case before we can engage in meaningful \nsettlement negotiations,\" said Renkes. \nThe key points of the stipulation are: \n•  Members of the class action lawsuit include all students who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) \nunder the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or a Section 504 Plan under the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973 and who have taken or who must the high school graduation qualifying exam. About 18,000 students \nstatewide at all grade levels have IEPs. \n•  The high school exam will not be used to deny a class member a high school diploma in the spring of 2004 if \nthe student has met all other requirements for a diploma. \n•  The State of Alaska will notify secondary school principals and special education directors about the stipulation. \nSchools will be required to notify parents, special education teachers and affected students. \n•  The State of Alaska and the plaintiffs’ lawyers will enter into negotiations to try to resolve the issues raised in \nthe lawsuit. The first negotiation is expected to be May 18. \n•  The State of Alaska and lawyers for the plaintiffs will report to the court progress on the negotiations no later \nthan July 9. \n### ",
