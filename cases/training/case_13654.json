The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Southern California, the ACLU of Northern California, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief, claiming that USCIS is violating plaintiffs' rights under the APA and federal regulations. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that USCIS does not conduct timely reasonable fear determinations, which are mandated to be completed within 10 days of referral to USCIS.</p><p>On July 17, 2014, the defendants moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and (6), arguing that the named Plaintiffs' individual claims are now moot as all five named Plaintiffs have now received reasonable fear determinations, and that the 10-day period is \"only a non-binding internal processing goal, not a mandatory deadline that confers enforceable rights on aliens.\"  Plaintiffs filed their opposition on August 18, 2014, responding that the claims of the putative class are inherently transitory and strongly rebuking defendants' claims of the \"aspirational\" nature of the 10-day period.</p><p>On November 21, 2014, the Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, and further granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification. Settlement discussions then began, and on August 20, 2015, the Court approved a preliminary class action settlement pending a fairness hearing. On October 27, 2015, the Court approved the final settlement and attorneys' fees and costs of $327,047.66. Under the settlement, USCIS must meet a goal of making a reasonable fear determination with an average of 10 days, and not in excess of 20 days. The settlement also included provisions to ensure compliance; it was scheduled to last for 5 years after its approval.</p>",

Plaintiffs challenge the government’s failure to process and complete their \n3  reasonable fear interviews and make reasonable fear determinations in compliance with the \n4  applicable immigration regulations. \n5  2.  Congress has provided this Court with subject matter jurisdiction over this case \n6  pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq., the Mandamus and Venue \n7  Act of 1962, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, and the general federal question jurisdiction provided pursuant to \n8  28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n9  3.  Personal jurisdiction exists over the Defendants in this case, owing to, among \n10  other things, the nationwide nature of Defendants’ conduct.  \n11  4.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. \n12  § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1) because a significant number of the events relevant to this action took \n13  place in this District, particularly with respect to Plaintiffs Credy Madrid Calderon and Gustavo \n14  Ortega, for whom the majority of their prolonged detention took place in this District, and \n15  because numerous witnesses reside in this District. \n16  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n17  5.  Every day, people who fear persecution and torture in their home countries flee \n18  to the United States in search of protection from harm and violence inflicted because of their \n19  race, religious beliefs, nationality, social group or political opinions. By statute and treaty, the \n20  United States government has committed that this nation will not expel, extradite or otherwise \n21  effect the involuntary return of any person to a country that would subject that person to \n22  persecution for any of those reasons, or to torture. \n23  6.  To live up to these commitments, the United States government has developed \n24  administrative processes to ensure that noncitizens identified for removal have an adequate \n25  opportunity to seek protection if they express fear of persecution or torture upon removal to their \n26  countries of origin. For certain individuals—those who are subject to “reinstatement” of a prior \n27  removal order and those who have been issued an “administrative” removal order based on their \n28  criminal and immigration history—that process begins with an interview where an asylum \n1\n \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page4 of 19\n \n \n1  officer determines whether the individual has articulated a reasonable fear of persecution or \n \n2  torture. Although the government imprisons these individuals while their claims are processed, it \n3  has committed to each of them that, within 10 days of his or her case being referred to an asylum \n4  officer, the officer will make a reasonable fear determination, and by doing so, initiate the \n5  process by which an immigration judge will consider his or her claim. That commitment is made \n6  manifest in a duly promulgated regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b). \n7  7.  The United States government, however, has broken that promise. Rarely if ever \n8  do the administrative agencies tasked with initiating and conducting the reasonable fear \n9  interviews, and assessing the claims made, accomplish those tasks within the prescribed 10 days. \n10  Instead, the government leaves immigrants to languish in detention for months and, in some \n11  cases, over a year before referring their cases to the immigration courts for a hearing on their \n12  claims.  \n13  8.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act and the Mandamus and Venue Act \n14  of 1962, the named Plaintiffs here seek, on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-situated \n15  immigrants, an order requiring the government to refer reasonable fear interview requests, \n16  conduct reasonable fear interviews, and issue reasonable fear determinations within the \n17  mandated 10 days and without unreasonable delay. By ordering the government to comply with \n18  its non-discretionary obligation to provide reasonable fear interviews and determinations in a \n19  timely manner, this Court will hold the United States to the promise made to all immigrants who \n20  seek refuge in this country, end improperly extended detentions, and give hope to the many who \n21  seek a new life free of persecution and torture. \n22  PARTIES \n23  Plaintiffs \n24  9.  Plaintiff Marco Antonio Alfaro Garcia is a native and citizen of El Salvador. He \n25  has been in the custody of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) at the \n26  Adelanto Detention Facility in Adelanto, California, since on or about January 16, 2014. Mr. \n27  Alfaro Garcia promptly expressed his fear of returning to El Salvador shortly after being taken \n28  into immigration custody, but has not received a reasonable fear determination for well in excess \n2 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page5 of 19\n \n \n1  of 10 days after being referred for a reasonable fear interview. Defendants’ failure to provide Mr. \n \n2  Alfaro Garcia a reasonable fear determination within the prescribed 10-day period has harmed, \n3  and will continue to harm, Mr. Alfaro Garcia by prolonging his detention and delaying his right to \n4  be heard on his claims for relief.  \n5  10.  Plaintiff Credy Madrid Calderon is a native and citizen of Honduras. He was first \n6  detained by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) on or about March 3, 2014, and \n7  transferred to ICE custody on or about March 6, 2014. He remains in ICE custody at West County \n8  Detention Center in Richmond, California. Mr. Madrid Calderon has not received a reasonable \n9  fear determination in his case for well in excess of 10 days after being referred for a reasonable \n10  fear interview. Defendants’ failure to provide Mr. Madrid Calderon a reasonable fear \n11  determination within the prescribed 10-day period has harmed, and will continue to harm, Mr. \n12  Madrid Calderon by prolonging his detention and delaying his right to be heard on his claims for \n13  relief. \n14  11.  Plaintiff Gustavo Ortega is a native and citizen of Mexico. He has been detained \n15  at the West County Detention Center in Richmond, California, since on or about February 27, \n16  2014. Mr. Ortega was referred for a reasonable fear interview after he expressed his fears of \n17  return to Mexico, but he has not received a reasonable fear determination for more than 10 days \n18  after the referral. Defendants’ failure to provide Mr. Ortega a reasonable fear determination \n19  within the prescribed 10-day period has harmed, and will continue to harm, Mr. Ortega by \n20  prolonging his detention and delaying his right to be heard on his claims for relief. \n21  12.  Plaintiff Claudia Rodriguez De La Torre is a native and citizen of Mexico. She \n22  has been detained by ICE since on or about mid-January 2014 at the Eloy Detention Center in \n23  Eloy, Arizona. Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre has not received a reasonable fear determination in her \n24  case for well in excess of 10 days after being referred for a reasonable fear interview. Defendants’ \n25  failure to provide Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre a reasonable fear determination within the \n26  prescribed 10-day period has harmed, and will continue to harm, Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre by \n27  prolonging her detention and delaying her right to be heard on her claims for relief. \n28 \n3 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page6 of 19\n \n \n1  13.  Plaintiff Nancy Bardalez Serpa is a native and citizen of Peru. She has been \n \n2  detained at the Eloy Detention Center in Eloy, Arizona, since on or about February 13, 2014. Ms. \n3  Bardalez Serpa has not received a reasonable fear determination in her case for well in excess of \n4  10 days after being referred for a reasonable fear interview. Defendants’ failure to provide Ms. \n5  Bardalez Serpa a reasonable fear determination within the prescribed 10-day period has harmed, \n6  and will continue to harm, Ms. Bardalez Serpa by prolonging her detention and delaying her right \n7  to be heard on her claims for relief. \n8  Defendants \n9  14.  Defendant Jeh Johnson is the Secretary of Homeland Security and the highest-\n10  ranking member of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the arm of the U.S. \n11  Government responsible for enforcement of the immigration laws. Mr. Johnson is sued in his \n12  official capacity. \n13  15.  Defendant Lori Scialabba is the Acting Director of the U.S. Citizenship and \n14  Immigration Services (“USCIS”), the arm of DHS charged with overseeing the Asylum Offices \n15  which process and complete reasonable fear determinations for noncitizens who express a fear of \n16  return to their country of origin. Ms. Scialabba is sued in her official capacity. \n17  16.  Defendant Joseph Langlois is the Associate Director of the Refugee, Asylum and \n18  International Operations Directorate, the office within USCIS that oversees the Asylum Division \n19  and Asylum Offices that conduct reasonable fear determinations for noncitizens who express a \n20  fear of return to their country of origin. Mr. Langlois is sued in his official capacity. \n21  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n22  Reasonable Fear Determination Process \n23  17.  The vast majority of individuals who undergo the reasonable fear process are \n24  individuals who have prior removal orders but have returned to the United States seeking refuge. \n25  Many of these individuals returned to their countries of origin after being removed from the \n26  United States, only to find that they are now the targets of violence and persecution. In some \n27  cases, it was that same violence and persecution that forced them to leave their homes in the first \n28  place, only such conditions have worsened in their absence. These individuals are forced to once \n4 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page7 of 19\n \n \n1  again abandon their home countries and make the journey to the United States seeking protection. \n \n2  Some of these individuals have already tried to seek asylum once, were summarily deported \n3  without a hearing after immigration officers ignored or discouraged their requests, yet return \n4  again because of the continued persecution or torture they face in their home countries. When \n5  apprehended by ICE or CBP, these individuals are held in an immigration detention center, \n6  subject to “reinstatement” of the prior removal order and subject to removal on that basis. See 8 \n7  U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).  \n8  18.  The reasonable fear process also applies to a second category of individuals: \n9  those who are subject to administrative removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1228 and 8 C.F.R. § \n10  238.1, but who fear violence and persecution if returned to their countries of origin. The \n11  government can detain and remove these individuals pursuant to this administrative removal \n12  process without seeing an immigration judge if an immigration officer determines that the \n13  noncitizen is not a lawful permanent resident, does not have conditional permanent residence, and \n14  has been convicted of certain criminal offenses. \n15  19.  However, if an individual subject to reinstatement of removal or to \n16  administrative removal fears return to his or her country of origin, the immigration laws require \n17  that he or she have an opportunity to request protection in the United States through “withholding \n18  of removal” and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, \n19  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”). Under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), a person \n20  may seek withholding of removal if his “life or freedom would be threatened in that country \n21  because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political \n22  opinion.” The availability of withholding of removal stems from the Refugee Act of 1980, \n23  through which the United States sought to bring its laws into conformity with the 1967 United \n24  Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19 U.S.T. 6223, under which \n25  countries committed not to “expel or return (‘refouler’) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the \n26  frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, \n27  religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.” 19 U.S.T. at \n28  6276.  \n5 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page8 of 19\n \n \n1  20.  Additionally, as a signatory to the CAT, the United States has committed “not to \n \n2  expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which \n3  there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to \n4  torture . . . .” Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 § 2242, Pub. L. 105-277, 112 \n5  Stat. 2681, 2681-821.  \n6  21.  “Withholding of removal” and CAT relief are mandatory, not discretionary—by \n7  law the United States cannot remove someone who qualifies for protection under these \n8  provisions. See Nuru v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2005) (“If an alien meets his \n9  burden of proof regarding future torture, withholding of removal is mandatory under the [CAT] \n10  implementing regulations, just as it is in the case of a well-founded fear of persecution”). \n11  22.  For a noncitizen subject to “reinstatement of removal” or “administrative \n12  removal” who expresses a fear of return, the federal government has implemented a two-stage \n13  process to determine whether the individual qualifies for withholding of removal or relief under \n14  the CAT. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31. After an individual expresses a fear of return, ICE and CBP are \n15  required to refer him or her to a USCIS asylum officer, who first conducts an interview and then \n16  makes a determination as to whether the individual has a “reasonable” basis to fear persecution or \n17  torture upon his or her return to the country of origin. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(c). If the asylum \n18  officer determines that the individual’s fear is reasonable, USCIS then refers the case to an \n19  immigration judge from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”) for full \n20  consideration of the claim. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(e).  \n21  23.  The government takes the position that noncitizens subject to reinstatement of \n22  removal or an administrative removal order are not eligible for a bond hearing to determine \n23  whether their detention is justified, regardless of whether they are determined to have a \n24  reasonable fear. As a result, these individuals are generally imprisoned throughout the entire \n25  period in which the government considers their claims for relief, including the reasonable fear \n26  process, immigration court proceedings, and any appeals. \n27 \n28 \n6 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page9 of 19\n \n \n1  Reasonable Fear Regulation and Internal Agency Guidelines \n \n2  24.  An immigration regulation sets forth a timeline for completion of reasonable fear \n3  determinations. The regulation provides that upon issuance of the administrative removal order or \n4  notice of reinstatement of an existing removal order, a noncitizen who expresses fear of return to \n5  his or her home country “shall be referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear \n6  determination.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b). The regulation further provides: “In the absence of \n7  exceptional circumstances, this determination will be conducted within 10 days of the referral.” \n8  Id. \n9  25.  Although this regulation is binding on the agency, the USCIS Asylum \n10  Division—the division responsible for making reasonable fear determinations—has foregone any \n11  attempt to comply with this official timeframe to complete reasonable fear interviews, let alone \n12  issue the reasonable fear determinations. \n13  26.  Instead, USCIS has implemented “goals” for the completion of reasonable fear \n14  interviews that simply ignore the mandated 10 days for reasonable fear determinations, and \n15  instead “encourage” applicant interviews within 45 days, adjudication of 85 percent of cases \n16  within 90 days, and monthly reports on cases still pending after 150 days. \n17  27.  In keeping with this position, the Asylum Division has not advised asylum \n18  officers of any binding timeframe for completion of reasonable fear determinations. \n19  Reasonable Fear Determinations Delays \n20  28.  Defendants routinely fail to meet the 10-day mandated timeframe for reasonable \n21  fear determinations. \n22  29.  The delays in providing reasonable fear determinations—which can range from \n23  several weeks and months in some locations to over a year in southern states such as Arizona and \n24  Texas—are common. Data from the USCIS Asylum Division reveal that the average wait time \n25  from the time a person is taken into custody to the time that a reasonable fear determination is \n26  finally served on an applicant is on average about 111 days. This includes an average of 49 days \n27  that individuals wait for USCIS to accept jurisdiction of a case. Even after USCIS accepts \n28  jurisdiction, individuals must wait an average of over 60 days for the Asylum Division to conduct \n7 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page10 of 19\n \n \n1  the interviews and make reasonable fear determinations before their cases can reach an \n \n2  immigration judge.  \n3  30.  The reasonable fear determination constitutes only the first stage in the process \n4  that a noncitizen must endure to obtain a final decision on his or her claims for relief. Once an \n5  applicant secures a hearing before an immigration judge, his or her case may take anywhere from \n6  several months to over a year, depending on whether the individual or the agency appeal decisions \n7  to the Board of Immigration Appeals or the federal appellate courts.  \n8  31.  These delays have had drastic human consequences on the named Plaintiffs, as \n9  their individual cases make clear: \n10  Plaintiff Marco Antonio Alfaro Garcia \n11  32.  Plaintiff Marco Antonio Alfaro Garcia, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has \n12  resided in the United States continuously since 2007.  \n13  33.  Shortly after coming to the United States in 2007, Mr. Alfaro Garcia met his \n14  current partner, Yeni Gomez. Mr. Alfaro Garcia has built a life with Ms. Gomez in the United \n15  States. Together, they have three children: two girls, ages four and three, and one boy, three \n16  months old. Ms. Gomez and all three children are United States citizens. Prior to his detention, \n17  Mr. Alfaro Garcia worked as a welder and was the sole provider for his family. \n18  34.  Mr. Alfaro Garcia has been previously deported from the United States. In 2005, \n19  Mr. Alfaro Garcia attempted to enter the country but was caught by immigration authorities. \n20  Instead of staying in detention, he decided to accept a removal order back to El Salvador. \n21  35.  Upon his return to El Salvador, Mr. Alfaro Garcia was subjected to several acts \n22  of violence, threats and harassment, including at the hands of the local police. In addition, Mr. \n23  Alfaro Garcia provided information to local prosecutors about the members of a local criminal \n24  group who were trying to extort money from him. He has since learned from friends in El \n25  Salvador that the members of the criminal group have been released from prison and have asked \n26  about his whereabouts. Mr. Alfaro Garcia fears that the members of this criminal group intend to \n27  harm him, and that the local police in El Salvador will be unable or unwilling to protect him. In \n28 \n8 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page11 of 19\n \n \n1  approximately 2007, as a result of the persecution that he suffered, Mr. Alfaro Garcia fled to the \n \n2  United States where he thought he would be safe. \n3  36.  On or about January 16, 2014, Mr. Alfaro Garcia was transferred to ICE custody \n4  after being arrested for driving under the influence. He has never been convicted of any other \n5  crime, aside from driving without a license. Shortly after Mr. Alfaro Garcia was taken to a \n6  processing center in downtown Los Angeles, an immigration officer informed him that he would \n7  be removed from the United States due to his previous deportation order from 2005. During that \n8  interview, Mr. Alfaro Garcia informed the immigration officer that he feared returning to El \n9  Salvador. \n10  37.  On that same date, on or about January 16, 2014, Mr. Alfaro Garcia was \n11  transferred to ICE custody at the Adelanto Detention Facility in Adelanto, California. A few \n12  weeks later, Mr. Alfaro Garcia met with another immigration officer, and again informed the \n13  officer that he feared returning to El Salvador. On or about February 11, 2014, Mr. Alfaro Garcia \n14  was interviewed by an asylum officer about his fear of returning to El Salvador. He has yet to \n15  receive a determination from that reasonable fear interview. Mr. Alfaro Garcia submitted a \n16  request to ICE inquiring about the status of his case, and was informed that it would take between \n17  four to six  months for a reasonable fear determination in his case. \n18  38.  Mr. Alfaro Garcia’s prolonged detention has been very difficult for him and his \n19  family. As a result of his detention, Mr. Alfaro Garcia could not be present for the birth of his \n20  youngest child. He has also been unable to provide financial support for his family since his \n21  detention, forcing Ms. Gomez to try to support her family by taking part-time work selling food \n22  on the weekends. The children cry almost daily because Mr. Alfaro Garcia is incarcerated. \n23  Plaintiff Credy Madrid Calderon \n24  39.  Plaintiff Credy Madrid Calderon, a native and citizen of Honduras, came to the \n25  United States when he was approximately seventeen years old. When Mr. Madrid Calderon was \n26  four years old, his father passed away and his mother left for the United States to find work. In his \n27  parents’ absence, Mr. Madrid Calderon suffered physical, sexual, and emotional abuse while \n28  growing up in Honduras. \n9 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page12 of 19\n \n \n1  40.  After coming to the United Sates, Mr. Madrid Calderon met his wife, Valentina, \n \n2  with whom he has a son. In addition, Mr. Madrid Calderon has two other children from a previous \n3  relationship. Mr. Madrid Calderon’s wife and children are all United States citizens. \n4  41.  In or around June 2013, Mr. Madrid Calderon was stopped for driving without a \n5  license. He has no other criminal history. At that time, Mr. Madrid Calderon first learned that he \n6  had a removal order from 2005, which was issued in his absence after he entered the United \n7  States as a minor. He was deported to Honduras on or about September 2013 on the basis of that \n8  prior removal order. \n9  42.  After Mr. Madrid Calderon was deported to Honduras he suffered intense \n10  persecution at the hands of a group of local men. The men demanded money from him, severely \n11  beat him, fired shots at him, and threatened to kill him. Fearing for his life, Mr. Madrid Calderon \n12  fled Honduras in approximately January 2014. \n13  43.  On or about March 3, 2014, Mr. Madrid Calderon was apprehended by border \n14  patrol officers after attempting to reenter the United States. Immigration officers informed him \n15  that he would be deported without seeing an immigration judge based on his prior removal order. \n16  He spent three days in a holding facility near the border and was then transferred to the South \n17  Texas Detention Facility in Pearsall, Texas. A few days after arriving at Pearsall, on or about \n18  March 10, 2014, Mr. Madrid Calderon submitted a detainee request form stating that he feared \n19  returning to Honduras. On or about March 12, 2014, he received a written response stating that \n20  his case had been forwarded to the Asylum Office. However, at this time, he still has not received \n21  a reasonable fear interview or determination in his case. \n22  44.  Mr. Madrid Calderon was subsequently transferred to the West County \n23  Detention Facility in Richmond, California, where he remains detained by ICE. His detention has \n24  created several hardships for his family as Mr. Madrid Calderon has been unable to provide \n25  financial or emotional support to his wife and children. \n26  Plaintiff Gustavo Ortega \n27  45.  Plaintiff Gustavo Ortega, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United \n28  States in 2000 near Phoenix, Arizona, and has resided in the United States continuously since that \n10 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page13 of 19\n \n \n1  time. He has two United States citizen children, ages eight and four. Prior to his detention, Mr. \n \n2  Ortega worked in construction and as a handyman, and he helped care for and financially support \n3  his children.  \n4  46.  On or around January 23, 2014, Mr. Ortega pled guilty to assault with a deadly \n5  weapon and was sentenced to one year with “half time” good conduct credits. This is Mr. \n6  Ortega’s only criminal conviction, other than citations for driving without a license. Mr. Ortega \n7  received an administrative order of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b). \n8  47.  On or about February 27, 2014, Mr. Ortega was transferred to ICE custody at the \n9  West County Detention Facility in Richmond, California, where he remains detained. The \n10  following day, Mr. Ortega was transferred to San Francisco to meet with an immigration officer, \n11  to whom he expressed a fear of returning to Mexico. Mr. Ortega fears returning to Mexico \n12  because his brother was brutally murdered by a drug cartel in Michoacan, Mexico. A video of the \n13  murder has been posted on YouTube. \n14  48.  On or about March 25, 2014, Mr. Ortega was interviewed by an asylum officer \n15  about his fear of returning to Mexico. He has still not received a determination pursuant to that \n16  interview. \n17  Plaintiff Claudia Rodriguez De La Torre \n18  49.  Plaintiff Claudia Rodriguez De La Torre, a native and citizen of Mexico, has \n19  resided in the United States since approximately 1998, with the exception of a short four-month \n20  visit to Mexico in 2001. Most of that time, she has lived in Reno, Nevada, where she worked \n21  primarily cleaning houses, taking care of children, and in restaurants. Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre \n22  has three children, ages ten, eight, and five, all of whom are United States citizens. \n23  50.  On or about January 12, 2014, Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre pled guilty to \n24  possession with intent to distribute heroin. While in criminal custody, on approximately January \n25  14, 2014, an ICE officer informed Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre that due to her conviction, she was \n26  ineligible to see an immigration judge.  She stated, however, that she feared returning to Mexico.  \n27  The following day, on approximately January 15, 2014, Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre was \n28 \n11 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page14 of 19\n \n \n1  transferred to ICE custody. She is currently detained at the Eloy Detention Center in Eloy, \n \n2  Arizona. \n3  51.  Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre fears being deported to Mexico because the father of \n4  her children, who had subjected her to domestic violence over a period of years, and who has \n5  been deported to Mexico on this basis, has become aware of her detention by ICE. Ms. Rodriguez \n6  De La Torre’s former partner has asked her family about the status of her case. She fears that this \n7  man will find her and possibly kill her because he blames her for his deportation to Mexico. \n8  52.  In or about late January or early February 2014, Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre was \n9  interviewed about her fear of returning to Mexico. Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre has still not \n10  received a determination from that reasonable fear interview.  \n11  53.  Ms. Rodriguez De La Torre is gravely concerned for her young children who are \n12  currently residing with relatives. She worries about their well-being should she continue to be \n13  separated from them while her immigration claims remain pending.  \n14  Plaintiff Nancy Bardalez Serpa \n15  54.  Plaintiff Nancy Bardalez Serpa, a native and citizen of Peru, was forced to flee \n16  her home country because of gender-based persecution she suffered there. Ms. Bardalez Serpa is a \n17  university graduate and enjoyed a stable, settled life in Peru. In approximately 2010 her life was \n18  torn apart by a man associated with cartels who targeted her for persecution. \n19  55.  Ms. Bardalez Serpa fled Peru in approximately 2012 and sought protection \n20  within the United States. Shortly after entering the United States in Arizona, she was apprehended \n21  by immigration authorities and taken to a detention center in Atlanta, Georgia. While in detention, \n22  Mr. Bardalez Serpa told an immigration officer that she feared returning to Peru due to the \n23  persecution she had suffered, but the officer told her that there was nothing to be done. She was \n24  subsequently deported.  \n25  56.  Although Ms. Baldalez Serpa tried to continue her life in her native country \n26  again after this deportation, her persecutor located her and began his persecution of her anew. \n27  57.  On or about February 12, 2014, Ms. Bardalez Serpa was apprehended while \n28  attempting to enter the United States again. When apprehended, Ms. Baraldez Serpa suffered a \n12 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page15 of 19\n \n \n1  severe asthma attack and had to be taken to a hospital immediately. The next day, she was taken \n \n2  to the Eloy Detention Center, in Eloy, Arizona, where she has been detained since.  \n3  58.  Shortly after her apprehension, Mr. Bardalez Serpa was informed by an \n4  immigration officer that she would be deported based on her prior removal order. Mr. Bardalez \n5  Serpa told the immigration officer that she greatly feared returning to Peru due to the abuse she \n6  had suffered there. Approximately a month later, on or about March 10, 2014, she was \n7  interviewed about her fear of returning to Peru. Ms. Bardalez Serpa has still not received a \n8  determination pursuant to her reasonable fear interview. \n9  59.  On approximately April 14, 2014, Ms. Bardalez Serpa, who has experienced \n10  depression while in ICE custody, sought to withdraw her request for a reasonable fear \n11  determination, but she subsequently decided to wait for a decision despite the despair that \n12  detention causes her. \n13  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n14  60.  Pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 23, Plaintiffs bring this action on \n15  behalf of themselves and all other similarly-situated individuals. Plaintiffs do not seek claims for \n16  compensatory relief. Instead, Plaintiffs seek only injunctive relief broadly applicable to members \n17  of the Plaintiff Class, as defined below. The requirements of Rule 23, and in particular Rule \n18  23(b)(2), are met with respect to the Plaintiff Class defined below. \n19  61.  The plaintiff-class (“Plaintiff Class”) consists of: All individuals who: (1) are or \n20  will be subject to removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5) or 8 U.S.C. § 1228; (2) who have \n21  expressed, or in the future express, a fear of returning to their country of removal; and (3) who \n22  have not received, or do not receive, a reasonable fear determination pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § \n23  208.31 within 10 days of referral to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. \n24  62.  The members of the Plaintiff Class are so numerous that joinder is impracticable. \n25  The number of individuals ICE and CBP have detained for more than 10 days pending a USCIS \n26  reasonable fear determination is not known with precision. The January 2014 USCIS Asylum \n27  Division data, however, shows that on any given day the number of members of the Plaintiff \n28  Class is likely in the hundreds.  \n13 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page16 of 19\n \n \n1  63.  Members of the Plaintiff Class reside in various DHS detention facilities across \n \n2  the United States. Joinder of the members of the Plaintiff Class in one case would create \n3  significant challenges to the efficient administration of justice that make such joinder \n4  impracticable.  \n5  64.  Further, there are questions of law and fact common to the members of the \n6  Plaintiff Class. Common questions of law include but are not limited to the following: \n7  a.  Whether the immigration regulations require that USCIS make all reasonable \n8  fear determinations within 10 days of referral; \n9  b.  Whether USCIS has unreasonably delayed agency action within the meaning of \n10  the Administrative Procedure Act by not completing reasonable fear determinations \n11  within 10 days of referral.  \n12  65.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Plaintiff Class. \n13  Plaintiffs know of no conflict between their interests and those of the Plaintiff Class they seek to \n14  represent.  \n15  66.  The members of the Plaintiff Class can be readily identified through notice and \n16  discovery.  \n17  67.  In defending their own rights, the individual Plaintiffs will defend the rights of \n18  all proposed Plaintiff Class members.  \n19  68.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel experienced in class litigation and in \n20  immigration law to represent them and the Plaintiff Class for the purpose of this litigation. \n21  69.  Defendants have acted, or refused to act, on grounds generally applicable to each \n22  member of the Plaintiff Class, insofar as they have failed to make a determination on their \n23  reasonable fear cases within 10 days of referral to USCIS. \n24  70.  A class action is superior to other methods available for the fair and efficient \n25  adjudication of this controversy because joinder of all members of the Plaintiff Class is \n26  impracticable. \n27 \n28 \n14 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page17 of 19\n \n \n1  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n \n2  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n3  71.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n4  contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n5  72.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) requires that an agency conclude \n6  matters presented to it within a “reasonable time.” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). The APA provides that a \n7  “reviewing court shall . . . compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 \n8  U.S.C. § 706(1) (emphasis added).  \n9  73.  Under the APA, whenever the law requires that the agency act within a certain \n10  amount of time, a court is obligated to compel the agency to act if it fails to comply within the \n11  mandated deadline. See Biodiversity Legal Found. v. Badgley, 309 F.3d 1166, 1177-78 & n.11 (9th \n12  Cir. 2002) (issuing injunction for agency to comply with statutory deadline); see also Norton v. \n13  South Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 65 (2004) (noting that “when an agency is \n14  compelled by law to act within a certain time period, but the manner of its action is left to the \n15  agency’s discretion, a court can compel the agency to act, but has no power to specify what the \n16  action must be”). \n17  74.  In compliance with immigration regulation 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b), the period for \n18  completion of reasonable fear determinations is mandated to be within 10 days of referral to \n19  USCIS. \n20  75.  Defendants have failed to comply with this mandatory directive, and in fact, as a \n21  matter of policy and procedure, do not even attempt to complete reasonable fear determinations \n22  within the mandated 10-day period. \n23  76.  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have suffered and will imminently suffer \n24  irreparable injury as a proximate result of this conduct, have no adequate remedy at law, and are \n25  entitled to injunctive relief to avoid that injury. \n26  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n27  Violation of 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) \n28 \n15 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page18 of 19\n \n \n1  77.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n \n2  contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n3  78.  Under the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, the court may order the \n4  Government to complete Plaintiffs and the Plaintiffs’ Class’s reasonable fear determinations \n5  within a reasonable time and in compliance with immigration regulation 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b), \n6  which requires completion of reasonable fear determinations within 10 days of referral to USCIS. \n7  79.  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class have suffered and will imminently suffer \n8  irreparable injury as a proximate cause of this failure to act, have no adequate remedy at law, and \n9  are entitled to injunctive relief to avoid any injury.  \n10  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n11    WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the Plaintiff Class, \n12  respectfully request that the Court grant the following relief: \n13    a.  Certify a class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 in \n14  accordance with the allegations of this Complaint and the forthcoming class certification \n15  motion;  \n16    b.  Declare that Defendants’ failure to complete Plaintiffs’ and other class \n17  members’ reasonable fear determinations within 10 days of referral violates federal law; \n18    c.  Order the Government to complete all of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ \n19  reasonable fear determinations within 10 days of referral to USCIS; and \n20    d.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable, including \n21  but not limited to fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, and any other applicable \n22  statute or regulation. \n   \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n16 \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:14-cv-01775   Document1   Filed04/17/14   Page19 of 19\n \n \n1  Dated: April 17, 2014      Respectfully  submitted, \n \n2                 \n3          By:  ___/s/ John D.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action and each of the parties in this action. \n5  2.  The Court finds that the Settlement appears to have resulted from arm’s-length \n6  negotiations by and among counsel for the parties who were reasonably skilled and prepared and \n7  who represented the best interests of their respective clients in negotiating the Settlement.  The \n8  settlement negotiations that led to the Settlement took place in mediation sessions supervised by \n9  Magistrate  Judge  Laurel  Beeler.    This  provides  the  Court  with  further  assurance  that  the \n10  negotiations leading to the Settlement were good faith, arm’s-length negotiations, based on a \n11  sufficiently developed record, and which appropriately considered the risks of trial, the potential \n12  resolution, and all other relevant factors leading to the Settlement. \n13  3.  Based on all of the facts and circumstances, the Court finds that Settlement is fair, \n14  reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the members of the Plaintiff Class. \n15  4.  The Court further finds that the attorneys’ fees and costs provision in the \n16  Settlement Agreement was the result of arm’s-length and good faith negotiations supervised by \n17  Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler.  The attorney’s fees and costs provision appears to have taken \n18  into consideration the right of Plaintiffs to seek an award of fees that would be substantially \n19  higher than the amount agreed to, the risks of trial, and all other relevant factors.  The Court \n20  therefore approves the provisions for attorney’s fees and costs contained in the Settlement \n21  Agreement in accordance with the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412, and 28 U.S.C. \n22  § 1920.   \n \nCase No. 4:14-cv-01775-YGR \nFINAL ORDER APPROVING SETTLEMENT \n  - 3 -   \n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133   Filed 10/27/15   Page 4 of 6\n1  5.  The Court further finds the Notice to the Class was reasonably calculated to \n2  apprise the Class of the pendency of this action and all material elements of the proposed \n3  settlement, constituted the best notice practicable under the circumstances, and constituted due \n4  and sufficient notice.   \n5  WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AS FOLLOWS: \n6  1.  The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action under 28 U .S.C. \n7  § 1331 (federal question), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. (Administrative Procedure Act), and 28 U.S.C. \n8  § 1361 (the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962). The Court has personal jurisdiction over the \n9  Plaintiff Class (as defined in the Court’s order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification \n10  (Dkt. 70 at 24)), the Settlement Class (as defined in paragraph 5 herein), and Defendants. \n11  2.  This Final Order adopts and incorporates by reference the terms and definitions of \n12  the Settlement Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  \n13  3.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), the Settlement as set forth in the \n14  Settlement Agreement is approved as fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Class. \n15  4.  The parties are directed to implement the Settlement Agreement in accordance \n16  with its terms and provisions.  \n17  5.  By its Preliminary Approval Order, dated August 20, 2015 (Dkt. No. 104), the \n18  Court preliminarily certified the following Settlement Class:    \n19  All persons who, during the term of the Settlement Agreement: \n20  a.  are or will be subject to a reinstated order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \n21  § 1231(a)(5) or an administrative removal order under 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b);  \n22  b.  have expressed, or in the future express, a fear of returning to his or her country \n23  of removal;  \n24  c.  are detained in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); \n25  and \n26  d.  have not received, or do not receive, an initial reasonable fear determination by \n27  USCIS under 8 C.F.R. § 208.31 within ten (10) days of referral to USCIS; but  \n \nCase No. 4:14-cv-01775-YGR \nFINAL ORDER APPROVING SETTLEMENT \n  - 4 -   \n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133   Filed 10/27/15   Page 5 of 6\n1  e.  the Settlement Class does not include any person who would otherwise be in the \n2  class if such individual receives his or her reasonable fear determination. \n3   \n4  6.  The Court finds that this Settlement Class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of \n5  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including the requirements of numerosity, commonality, \n6  typicality and adequacy pursuant to Rule 23(a) and the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).  The Court \n7  hereby certifies the Settlement Class as described in Paragraph 5 of this Final Order. \n8  7.  The  Court  approves  Marco  Antonio  Alfaro  Garcia,  Credy  Madrid  Calderon, \n9  Gustavo Ortega, and Claudia Rodriguez De La Torre as Class Representatives of the Settlement \n10  Class.  \n11  8.  The Court finds that American Civil Liberties Union Foundation Of Southern \n12  California, The National Immigrant Justice Center (A Heartland Alliance Partner), American \n13  Civil Liberties Union Foundation Of Northern California and Reed Smith LLP, (collectively, \n14  “Class Counsel”), have fairly and adequately represented the interests of the Plaintiff Class and \n15  satisfied all the requirements of Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n16  9.  The Court, having approved the provision for attorney’s fees and costs in the \n17  Settlement Agreement, hereby orders that these fees and costs be paid in accordance with the \n18  Settlement Agreement. \n19  10.  In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, this action is hereby dismissed \n20  with prejudice and the Plaintiff Class is barred from future prosecution of the Settled Claims (as \n21  defined in the Settlement Agreement).  Without in any way affecting the finality of this Final \n22  Order, this Court has continuing jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcing the Settlement and as \n23  to all matters relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement for the \n24  term described therein, not to exceed five years. \n \nCase No. 4:14-cv-01775-YGR \nFINAL ORDER APPROVING SETTLEMENT \n  - 5 -   \n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133   Filed 10/27/15   Page 6 of 6\n1  11.  Under Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court, in the interests \n2  of justice, and there being no just reason for delay, expressly directs the Clerk of the Court to \n3  enter this Final Approval Order. \n4  This Order terminates Docket Number 129. \n5  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n6  Dated: October 27, 2015 \n____________________________ \nYVONNE GONZALEZ ROGERS \nU.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE \n \nCase No. 4:14-cv-01775-YGR \nFINAL ORDER APPROVING SETTLEMENT \n  - 6 -   \n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 1 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 2 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 3 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 4 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 5 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 6 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 7 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 8 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 9 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 10 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 11 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 12 of 13\n\nCase 4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document 133-1   Filed 10/27/15   Page 13 of 13",

INTRODUCTION \n3\n  Plaintiffs, Marco A. Alfaro-Garcia (“Alfaro”), Credy Madrid Calderon (“Madrid”), \n4\nGustavo Ortega (“Ortega”), Claudia Rodriguez de la Torre (“Rodriguez”), and Nancy Bardalez \n5\nSerpa (“Bardalez”), filed a Complaint on their behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated \n6 seeking review of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (“USCIS”) timeliness in \n7 reaching “reasonable fear” determinations under 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b).  See Compl., ECF No. 1.  \nThis regulation states that “upon issuance of a Final Administrative Removal Order under \n8\n§ 238.1 of this chapter, or notice under § 241.8(b) of this chapter that an alien is subject to \n9\nremoval, an alien described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be referred to an asylum officer \n10\nfor a reasonable fear determination.  In the absence of exceptional circumstances, this \n11\ndetermination will be conducted within 10 days of the referral.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b).  Plaintiffs \n12\nallege that USCIS violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), by not \n13\nrendering reasonable fear determinations within 10 days.  See Compl. ¶¶ 71-79.   \n14\n  As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed in part under Rule \n15\n12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs’ individual claims are moot.  \n16 Because USCIS has already made reasonable fear determinations as to all five Plaintiffs, their \n17 individual claims as to any delay in USCIS action are moot.  Therefore, this Court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction as to Plaintiffs’ individual claims, and should dismiss the complaint in part.   \n18\n  Additionally, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and \n19\n12(b)(6) because the determination of whether “exceptional circumstances” exist is a \n20\ndiscretionary determination not reviewable under the APA and the regulations contain no \n21\nmeaningful standard to determine “exceptional circumstances.”  Moreover, as the regulation \n22\ndoes not state a penalty for failure to adjudicate within the 10-day period, the 10-day \n23\nadjudication represents only a non-binding internal processing goal, not a mandatory deadline \n24\nthat confers enforceable rights on aliens.  Lastly, Plaintiffs failed to state a claim that any delay \n25\nby USCIS violates the APA because Plaintiffs failed to show that USCIS’s delay is unreasonable \n26 as a matter of law.  Therefore, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint.   \n27  \n28  \n  1   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page10 of 27\n \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n1\nA.  Marco A. Alfaro Garcia. \n2\n  Plaintiff Alfaro is a native and citizen of El Salvador.  Ex. 1-A, Form I-213, Record of \n3\nDeportable/Inadmissible Alien.2  Alfaro first entered the United States on September 12, 2005, at \n4\nor near Lukeville, Arizona.  Ex. 1-B, Form I-205, Warrant of Removal/Deportation.   On \n5\nSeptember 28, 2005, the Immigration Judge ordered that Alfaro be removed to El Salvador.  Ex. \n6 3, Order of the Immigration Judge.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) executed \n7 Alfaro’s removal order on September 29, 2005.  Ex. 1-B.  However, on or about March of 2007, \nAlfaro unlawfully returned to the United States at or near Laredo, Texas, without being admitted \n8\nor paroled.  Ex. 1-A.  On January 14, 2014, Alfaro was arrested in Los Angeles, California, for \n9\ndriving under the influence.  Ex. 1-A.  Two days later, on January 16, 2014, ICE took Alfaro into \n10\ncustody.  Ex. 1-A.  On January 16, 2014, an ICE officer issued an order reinstating Alfaro’s \n11\norder of removal to El Salvador.  Ex. 1-C, I-871, Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior \n12\nOrder.  While in ICE custody, Alfaro expressed a fear of return to El Salvador.  Ex. 1-D, Record \n13\nof Sworn Statement in Administrative Proceedings.   \n14\n  On or about January 28, 2014, ICE referred Alfaro’s case to USCIS for a reasonable fear \n15\ndetermination.  Ex. 1-E, Email from Michael McDaniel.  USCIS interviewed Alfaro on or about \n16 February 11, 2014.  Ex. 1-F, Form I-899, Record of Determination/Reasonable Fear Worksheet.  \n17 USCIS issued a decision on April 25, 2014, concluding that Alfaro did not have a reasonable fear \nof persecution or torture in El Salvador.  Ex. 1-G, Form I-898, Record of Negative Reasonable \n18\nFinding and Request for Review by Immigration Judge.   \n19\nB.  Credy Madrid Calderon. \n20\n  Plaintiff Madrid is a native and citizen of Honduras.  Ex. 2-A, Form I-862, Notice to \n21\nAppear.  Madrid first entered the United States on November 28, 2004 at or near Laredo, Texas, \n22\nwithout being admitted or paroled.  Ex. 2-A.  On May 25, 2005, Madrid was ordered removed to \n23\nHonduras.  Ex. 2-B, Memorandum and Order of the Immigration Judge.  Madrid was removed to \n24\nHonduras on or about September 27, 2013.  Ex. 2-C, Form I-871; Notice of Intent/Decision to \n25\nReinstate Prior Order; Ex. 2-D, Form I-215B, Record of Sworn Statement in Affidavit Form.  \n26 However, on or about March 2, 2014, Madrid illegally reentered the United States at or near \n27\n                                                                 \n2   Exhibits 1 to 5 are attached to the Declaration of Victor M. Mercado-Santana \n28\naccompanying this response.  See L.R. 7-2(d), 7-5(a). \n  2   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page11 of 27\n \nLaredo, Texas.  Exs. 2-C, 2-D.  On March 6, 2014, ICE issued an order reinstating Madrid’s \n1\n2005 order of removal.  Ex. 2-C.   \n2\n  On or about April 3, 2014, USCIS notified Madrid that he was scheduled for a reasonable \n3\nfear interview, which was conducted or about May 12, 2014.  Ex. 2-E, Form M-488, Information \n4\nabout Reasonable Fear Interview; Ex. 2-F, Form I-899, Record of Determination/Reasonable \n5\nFear Worksheet.  USCIS issued a decision on May 29, 2014, finding that Madrid had a \n6 reasonable fear of persecution or torture.  Ex. 2-G, Form I-863, Notice of Referral to the \n7 Immigration Judge.   \n8 C. Gustavo  Ortega.   \n  Plaintiff Ortega is a native and citizen of Mexico.  Ex. 3-A, Form I-213, Record of \n9\nDeportable/Inadmissible Alien.  Ortega first entered the United States in September 2009 at or \n10\nnear Arizona without being admitted or paroled.  Ex. 3-A.  On January 23, 2014, Ortega was \n11\nconvicted of an aggravated felony, to wit, assault with a deadly weapon likely to cause great \n12\nbodily injury, in violation of section 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code.  Ex. 3-B, Waiver on \n13\nPlea of Guilty/No Contest, People v. Ortega.  On February 27, 2014, ICE issued a final \n14\nadministrative order of removal against Ortega.  Ex. 3-C, Form I-851; Ex. 3-D, Form I-851A.  \n15\nOn or about February 26, 2014, Ortega expressed a fear of return to Mexico.  Exs. 3-A; 3-C.   \n16   On or about February 28, 2014, USCIS provided notice to Ortega that he was scheduled \n17 for a reasonable fear interview.  Ex. 3-D, Form G-56, Notice of Reasonable Fear Interview; Ex. \n3-E, Form M-488, Information About Reasonable Fear Interview.  USCIS interviewed Ortega on \n18\nor about March 25, 2014.  Ex. 3-F, Form I-899, Record of Determination/Reasonable Fear \n19\nWorksheet.  USCIS issued a decision on April 29, 2014, concluding that Ortega does not have a \n20\nreasonable fear of persecution or torture.  Ex. 3-G, Form I-898, Record of Negative Reasonable \n21\nFear Finding. \n22\nD.  Claudia Rodriguez de la Torre \n23\n  Plaintiff Rodriguez is a native and citizen of Mexico.  Ex. 4-A, Form I-213.  In 1998, \n24\nRodriguez first entered the United States at or near San Luis, Arizona, without being admitted or \n25\nparoled.  Ex. 4-A.  On January 2, 2014, Rodriguez was convicted of an aggravated felony, to wit, \n26 possession of a controlled substance for sale in violation of title 40, section 453.337 of the \n27 Nevada Revised Statutes.  Ex. 4-B, Judgment, State v. Rodriguez-de la Torre, No. CR13-1802 \n28 (Washoe Cnty. Dist. Ct. Jan. 2, 2014).  On January 21, 2014, Rodriguez was issued a final \n  3   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page12 of 27\n \nadministrative order of removal.  Ex. 4-C, Form I-851; Ex. 4-D, Form I-851A.  That same day, \n1\nRodriguez expressed a fear of return to Mexico.  Ex. 4-B. \n2\n  On or about January 31, 2014, Rodriguez was referred to USCIS for a reasonable fear \n3\ndetermination.  Ex. 4-E, Email from Justin Smith.  USCIS interviewed Rodriguez on or about \n4\nFebruary 6, 2014.  Ex. 4-F, Form I-899.  USCIS issued a decision on April 23, 2014, concluding \n5\nthat Rodriguez established that she had a reasonable fear of persecution in Mexico.  Ex. 4-G, \n6 Form I-863.  \n7 E. Nancy  Bardalez Serpa \n  Plaintiff Bardalez is a native and citizen of Peru.  Ex. 5-A, Form I-213.  On June 27, \n8\n2012, Bardalez was ordered removed from the United States, and was subsequently removed.  \n9\nEx. 5-B, Form I-860; Ex. 5-C, Form I-296.  On February 11, 2014, Bardalez unlawfully \n10\nreentered the United States at or near Douglas, Arizona.  Ex. 5-B; 5-D, Form I-871.  ICE \n11\nreinstated Bardalez’s order of removal on February 12, 2014.  Ex. 5-D.   \n12\n  On or about February 14, 2014, Bardalez was referred to USCIS for a reasonable fear \n13\ndetermination.  Ex. 5-E, Email from Justin M. Laub.  USCIS interviewed Bardalez on or about \n14\nMarch 10, 2014.  Ex. 5-F, Form I-899.  USCIS issued a decision on April 16, 2014, concluding \n15\nthat Bardalez established a reasonable fear of persecution.  Ex. 5-G, Form I-863. \n16 II. LEGAL  BACKGROUND \n17 A.  Motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1). \n  A complaint may be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n18\nProcedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th \n19\nCir. 2014).  The Court may consider affidavits and other evidence in order to be satisfied that \n20\njurisdiction exists.  Savage v. Glendale Union High School, 343 F.3d 1036, 1040 n.2 (9th Cir. \n21\n2003).  As the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of \n22\nestablishing that jurisdiction exists.  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 376-78 \n23\n(1994). \n24\nB.  Motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). \n25\n  A complaint may be dismissed for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \n26 granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  When reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \n27 the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts and allegations in the complaint.  Ashcroft v. \n28 Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  In addition to the pleadings, the Court may consider “materials \n  4   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page13 of 27\n \nembraced by the pleadings, exhibits attached to the pleadings, and matters subject to judicial \n1\nnotice.  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1030-31 (9th Cir. 2008); \n2\nsee also Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007) (stating that \n3\ncourts “must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily \n4\nexamine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated \n5\ninto the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice”).  \n6 However, the Court is not required to accept a plaintiff’s legal conclusions.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n7 678.  Furthermore, “only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to \ndismiss.”  Id. at 679.   \n8\nC.  Reasonable fear determination procedures. \n9\n  On February 19, 1999, the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”)3 \n10\nadopted interim regulations as part of the Government’s efforts to comply with its international \n11\nobligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).  See Regulations \n12\nConcerning the Convention Against Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8,478 (Feb. 19, 1999).  The \n13\nregulations sought to create fair and efficient procedures by which the United States would \n14\ncomply with its CAT obligations “within the overall regulatory framework for the issuance of \n15\nremoval orders and decisions about the execution of such order.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 8,479.  Certain \n16 aliens (including the Plaintiffs in this case) may seek protection from removal in accordance with \n17 the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 208.31.  This regulation covers aliens who are subject to final \nadministrative orders of removal as well as aliens who are subject to removal under reinstated \n18\norders of removal.4  8 C.F.R. § 208.31(a).  \n19\n20\n                                                                 \n21 3   On March 1, 2003, the functions of the former INS were transferred from the Department \nof Justice to three distinct components (United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \n22\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection, and USCIS) in the newly formed Department of \n23 Homeland Security (“DHS”).  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 \nStat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002). \n24\n \n4   An administrative order of removal may be entered by ICE if the alien 1) was not \n25\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence, or had only been admitted conditionally for \n26 permanent residence under 8 U.S.C. § 1186a; and 2) was convicted of an aggravated felony.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1228(a)-(c); 8 C.F.R. § 238.1(b)(1); see U.S. v. Hernandez-Vermudez, 356 F.3d 1011, \n27\n1013 (9th Cir. 2004) (discussing the applicability of expedited removal to unadmitted aliens \nconvicted of aggravated felonies).  An alien is subject to removal under a reinstated order of \n28\nremoval if he or she 1) is subject to a prior order of removal; 2) was previously removed or \n  5   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page14 of 27\n \n  If an alien is subject to either a final administrative order of removal or reinstatement of a \n1\nprior removal order, and he or she expresses a fear of return to the country of removal, then the \n2\nalien is referred to USCIS for a reasonable fear determination.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(a)-(b).  \n3\nThe alien is not referred to USCIS at the moment that he or she expresses a fear of return, but \n4\ninstead the referral happens “upon issuance” of the final administrative order or the notice of \n5\nreinstatement of removal.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) (“Upon issuance of a Final Administrative \n6 Removal Order [] or notice [] that an alien is subject to removal, an alien [] shall be referred to \n7 an asylum officer for a reasonable fear determination.”).  The regulations do provide that the \nreasonable fear determination will be conducted within 10 days of the referral.  Id.  However, \n8\nthis deadline does not apply when “exceptional circumstances” are present.  Id.   \n9\n  Aliens who are found to have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture are referred to an \n10\nImmigration Judge for full consideration of their claims for withholding of removal under 8 \n11\nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or withholding or deferral of removal under CAT under 8 C.F.R. § 208.16 \n12\nand 8 C.F.R. § 208.17.  8 C.F.R. § 208.31(e).  However, an alien whom USCIS determines not to \n13\nhave a reasonable fear of persecution may request that an Immigration Judge review USCIS’s \n14\ndetermination, and if the Immigration Judge disagrees with USCIS, the alien may pursue full \n15\nconsideration of his or her claim before the Immigration Judge.  8 C.F.R. § 208.31(f)-(g).   \n16   The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 208.31 seeks to strike a balance between the need for prompt \n17 execution of removals and the Government’s international obligations.  The regulation “is \nintended to provide for the fair resolution of claims both to withholding under section 241(b)(3) \n18\nof the act [8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)], and to protection under [CAT] without unduly disrupting the \n19\noperation of these special administrative removal processes.”  69 Fed. Reg. at 8,485.   \n20\nARGUMENT \n21\nA.  Plaintiff’s individual claims should be dismissed because they are moot.   \n22\n  Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to the \n23\nconsideration of actual cases or controversies.  Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998).  Under \n24\nthis requirement, “throughout the litigation, the plaintiff must have suffered, or be threatened \n25\nwith, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial \n26 decision.”  Spencer, 523 U.S. at 7.  A case is moot “when the issues presented are no longer \n27\n                                                                                                                                                                                                               \ndeparted voluntarily; and 3) unlawfully reentered the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5); 8 \n28\nC.F.R. § 241.8(a); Moralez-Izquierdo v. Gonzales, 486 F.3d 484, 491 (9th Cir. 2007).   \n  6   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page15 of 27\n \n‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Toyo Tire Holdings of \n1\nAm. v. Cont’l Tire of N. Am., Inc., 609 F.3d 975, 982-83 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Murphy v. \n2\nHunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1984)).  A court must dismiss a case as moot if the court can no longer \n3\nprovide the petitioner with “effective relief.”  GATX/Airlog Corp. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the N. \n4\nDist. of Cal., 192 F.3d 1304, 1306 (9th Cir. 1999).  An actual controversy must exist “at all \n5\nstages of proceedings, not merely at the time when the complaint is filed.”  Id.  If a case becomes \n6 moot, then the Court lacks jurisdiction because mootness is jurisdictional.  Tor v. YouTube, Inc., \n7 562 F.3d 1212, 1214 (9th Cir. 2009).   \n  In the case of Bardalez, she received her reasonable fear determination on April 16, 2014 \n8\n– the day before Plaintiffs filed their complaint seeking adjudication of their reasonable fear \n9\ndeterminations.  See Ex. 5-G.  Any claim that Bardalez may have had relating to the adjudication \n10\nof her reasonable fear determination was moot by the time she filed her complaint.  See \n11\nGATX/Airlog, 192 F.3d at 1306.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed as it \n12\nrelates to Bardalez for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.5  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).   \n13\n  As for the remaining Plaintiffs, all four have already received their reasonable fear \n14\ndeterminations.  See Exs. 1-G (Alfaro’s April 25, 2014, reasonable fear determination), 2-G \n15\n(Madrid’s May 29, 2014, reasonable fear determination); 3-G (Ortega’s April 29, 2014, \n16 reasonable fear determination); 4-G (Rodriguez’s April 23, 2014, reasonable fear determination).  \n17 Any claims that the remaining Plaintiffs may have in their individual capacity are moot and no \nlonger present a case or controversy.  See GATX/Airlog, 192 F.3d at 1306.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ \n18\ncomplaint should be dismissed as it relates to their individual claims for lack of subject matter \n19\njurisdiction.6  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).   \n20\nB.  The Regulation does not mandate adjudication within 10 days, as there is no penalty \n21\nprovided if the 10-day goal is not met. \n22 The individual claims should also be dismissed because they fail to state a claim for \n23 relief.  Simply put, Plaintiffs have failed to identify a non-discretionary duty that they are owed.  \n24\n                                                                 \n25\n5   Plaintiffs have stated that Bardalez will voluntarily dismiss her claim.  See Pls’ Reply in \n26 Support of Mot. for Class Cert., ECF No. 40, at 3 n.1. \n \n27 6   Defendants recognize that with the exception of Plaintiff Bardalez, dismissal of \nPlaintiffs’ individual claims does not necessarily mean that their class allegations are dismissed.  \n28\nU.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397-401 (1980).   \n  7   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page16 of 27\n \nThe regulation at issue, 8 C.F.R. 208.31(b), is an internal administrative processing guideline \n1\nthat does not create a mandatory timeline for agency action and moreover does not create a \n2\nprocedural right enforceable by an alien.   \n3\nFirst, there is no basis to compel agency compliance with the 10-day time limitation.  \n4\nGenerally, Congressional deadlines to Government agencies are interpreted as hortatory and “do \n5\nnot limit their power or render its exercise in disregard of the requisitions ineffectual.”  French v. \n6 Edwards, 80 U.S. 506, 511 (1872).  As the Supreme Court observed:  “It ignores reality to expect \n7 that the Government will be able to secure perfect performance from its hundreds of thousands \nof employees scattered throughout the continent.”  Office of Pers. Management v. Richmond, 496 \n8\nU.S. 414, 433 (1990).  The Supreme Court does not expect perfection and directs that statutory \n9\ndeadlines, when applied to the Government, should be interpreted as advisory deadlines meant to \n10\nprod the Government to expeditious action.  See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, \n11\n162 (2003) (“It is impossible to believe that Congress meant its Herculean effort to resolve the \n12\ncoal industry benefit crisis to come to absolutely nothing if trustees were designated late.”); \n13\nRegions Hospital v. Shalala, 522 U.S. 448, 460 n.3 (1998) (finding that Secretary’s failure to \n14\nmeet a deadline to promulgate regulations did not mean that official lacked power to act beyond \n15\nit).  Likewise, “an administrative agency is not a slave of its rules” and agencies may waive \n16 compliance with their own procedural rules in certain instances.  Health Sys. Agency of Okla. v. \n17 Norman, 589 F.2d 486, 790 n.5 (10th Cir. 1978) (internal quotations and citation omitted); see \nAmerican Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, 397 U.S. 538-39 (1970) (“It is always \n18\nwithin the discretion of . . . an administrative agency to relax or modify its procedural rules \n19\nadopted for the orderly transaction of business before it when in a given case the ends of justice \n20\nrequire it.”); Ass’n of Am. Physicians & Surgs. v. United States HHS, 224 F. Supp. 2d 1115, \n21\n1127-1128 (S.D. Tex. 2002) (“Agency delays, particularly in the face of huge administrative \n22\nburdens, are common, and in this case such delays do not result in the invalidation of HHS’s \n23\nauthority to promulgate the Privacy Rule.”). \n24\nSecond, there are no grounds to sanction the Government for alleged noncompliance with \n25\nthe regulation.  A statutory or regulatory time limitation is not mandatory unless it both 1) \n26 “expressly requires an agency or public official to act within a particular time period” and 2) \n27 “specifies a consequence for failure to comply with the provision.”  Brock v. Pierce County, 476 \n28 U.S. 253, 259 (1986) (internal citation and quotations omitted); see United States v. James \n  8   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page17 of 27\n \nDaniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43, 63 (1993) (“If a statute does not specify a consequence \n1\nfor noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, the federal courts will not in the ordinary \n2\ncourse impose their own coercive sanction.”); United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, \n3\n711-12 (1990) (“There is no presumption or rule that for every mandatory duty imposed upon the \n4\n. . . Government . . . there must exist some corollary punitive sanction for departures or \n5\nomissions, even if negligent.”); Hendrickson v. FDIC, 113 F.3d 98, 102 (7th Cir. 1997) (“absent \n6 a clear indication to the contrary, regulatory deadlines, like statutory deadlines, provide no \n7 remedy for their own violation.”). \nIn Brock, Congress imposed a requirement that the Department of Labor audit certain \n8\ngrant recipients within 120 days of receiving a complaint, but the agency audited a recipient after \n9\nthat deadline had passed.  476 U.S. at 255-56.  The Court rejected respondent’s argument that the \n10\nSecretary was precluded from acting after the 120-day statutory period.  Id. at 257-60.  The \n11\nCourt found no basis to create and apply a sanction for “every failure of an agency to observe a \n12\nprocedural requirement” where Congress did not specify a consequence for failing to comply \n13\nwith the time period.   Id. at 260.  The Court further rejected the respondent’s claim that the \n14\nSecretary’s own regulations – which provided a timetable for the resolution of complaints and \n15\naudits – precluded the Secretary from acting after the time limitation.  Id. at 265.  The Court held \n16 that “even if it were possible for the Secretary to create a jurisdictional limitation not contained \n17 in the statute,” there was no sanction for violating the regulation because it did not specify a \nconsequence of failing to meet the deadline.  Id. \n18\nThe regulation at issue is not mandatory because it neither requires the agency to act \n19\nwithin a particular time period nor specifies a consequence for failing to comply with the time \n20\nperiod.  While the regulation states that the agency should conduct the reasonable fear \n21\ndetermination within 10 days, this time period only applies in the “absence of exceptional \n22\ncircumstances.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b).  In other words, the 10-day time period set out in the \n23\nregulation is not absolute.  Notably, the regulation itself contemplates deviations from the \n24\naspirational 10-day goal by specifically authorizing the Government, within its discretion, to take \n25\nadditional time to complete the reasonable fear determination where the Government believes \n26 exceptional circumstances prevent a speedier determination.  In addition, the regulation does not \n27 specify a consequence for failing to meet the 10-day time frame.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31.  And \n28 the courts may not “invent a remedy to satisfy some perceived need to coerce the . . . \n  9   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page18 of 27\n \nGovernment into complying with the statutory time limits.”  U.S. v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. \n1\n711, 717 (1990).   \n2\nMoreover, the agency cannot create a mandatory time limitation by regulation where it \n3\ndoes not exist in the statute.  Brock, 476 U.S. at 265 (stating that “even if it were possible for the \n4\nSecretary to create a jurisdictional limitation not contained in the statute,” violation of the time \n5\nlimitation was not sanctionable).  Notably, none of the applicable statutes sets a time limitation \n6 for conducting reasonable fear determinations, let alone specifies a consequence for failure to \n7 reach a determination within 10 days.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (prohibiting removal of certain \naliens to a country if USCIS determines that “the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened in \n8\nthat country” but failing to set any timelines for such determinations); 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5) \n9\n(failing to mention reasonable fear determinations in provision governing reinstatement of prior \n10\nremoval orders); 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b) (failing to mention reasonable fear determinations in \n11\nprovision governing final administrative of removal of aggravated felons). \n12\nWhat is more, Congress declared in relation to both final administrative orders of \n13\nremoval and reinstatement proceedings: “[n]othing in this section shall be construed to create \n14\nany substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the \n15\nUnited States or its agencies or officers or any other person.”  8 U.S.C. §§ 1228(a)(1), 1231(h).  \n16 By extension, the regulation at issue – which relates to the final administrative orders of removal \n17 provision under section 1228 and the reinstatement provision under section 1231 – also does not \ncreate any legally enforceable right or benefit.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(a) (“This section shall \n18\napply to any alien . . . whose deportation, exclusion or removal order is reinstated under [8 \n19\nU.S.C. § 1231(a)(5)].”).  Because Congress did not intend for any statutory timelines relating to \n20\nfinal administrative orders of removal and reinstatement to create causes of action for aliens, the \n21\nrelated regulation cannot create a mandatory time limitation.  See Dipeppe v. Quarantillo, 337 \n22\nF.3d 326, 333-34 (3d Cir. 2003) (finding failure to comply with statute requiring Attorney \n23\nGeneral to begin removal proceedings “as expeditiously as possible” is not actionable where \n24\nformer 8 U.S.C. § 1229(d)(2) provided that “nothing in this subsection shall be construed to \n25\ncreate any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable”).   \n26 To create a sanction, where it does not exist in statute or regulation, is also inconsistent \n27 with agency intent.  By providing an expedited process under 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b), the legacy \n28 INS intended to ensure that aliens do not use the reasonable fear process to delay their removal \n  10   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page19 of 27\n \nby making frivolous claims.  See 64 Fed. Reg. at 8,479 (“[W]e have created mechanisms to \n1\nquickly identify and resolve frivolous claims to protection so that the new procedures cannot be \n2\nused as a delaying tactic by aliens who are not in fact at risk.”).  In other words, the 10-day \n3\nprovision was intended to “spur [adjudicating officers] to action, not to limit [the agency’s] \n4\nscope of authority” by creating a duty owed to aliens.  See Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.S. 253, \n5\n259, 265 (1986); Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085, 1088 (9th Cir. 1993) (finding no cause \n6 of action where the Government delayed initiation of deportation proceedings in violation of \n7 former 8 U.S.C. § 1252(i) because legislative history showed that “Congress enacted it out of \nconcern, not with the rights of aliens, but with prison overcrowding”).  There is simply no basis \n8\nto conclude that the 10-day provision created a legally enforceable right or benefit for the alien.  \n9\nSee Giddings v. Chandler, 979 F.2d 1104, 1110 (5th Cir. 1992) (finding alien lacked standing to \n10\ncompel commencement of proceedings because while “[w]e read § 1252(i) as imposing a duty \n11\non the Attorney General to deport criminal aliens, [] we stop short of concluding that this creates \n12\na duty owed to the alien.”) (emphasis in original).  Thus, this Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ \n13\ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief \n14\nmay be granted.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (b)(6). \n15\nC.  Exceptional circumstances is not defined in the Regulation, and is a discretionary \ndetermination not subject to APA review.  \n16\n  This Court should dismiss all individual and class claims because there is no standard \n17\nagainst which this Court can determine whether “exceptional circumstances” as contemplated in \n18\n8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) excuse USCIS’s longer adjudication periods.  The regulation itself does not \n19\ndefine “exceptional circumstances,” and Plaintiffs have not pointed to any outside authority \n20\ncabining the agency’s authority to determine what constitutes an “exceptional circumstance.”  \n21\nConsequently, whether “exceptional circumstances” exist remains a determination left to the \n22 agency’s broad discretion.  In the absence of meaningful standards to apply to the agency action, \n23 this Court lacks jurisdiction to review APA challenges to agency action..   \n24   Under the APA, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review “agency action committed to the \nagency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(A)(2).  As the Supreme Court stated:  \n25\n[R]eview is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no \n26\nmeaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.  \n27 In such a case, the statute (“law”) can be taken to have “committed” the decision \nmaking to the agency’s judgment absolutely. . . .  [I]f no judicially manageable \n28\nstandards are available for judging how and when an agency should exercise its \n  11   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page20 of 27\n \ndiscretion, then it is impossible to evaluate agency action for “abuse of \n1\ndiscretion.”  \n2 Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985).  Courts examine the language and structure of the \n3 law at issue, as well as the nature of the agency action at issue, to determine whether the agency \n4 action is committed to the agency’s discretion.  See Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. U.S., 648 F.3d 708, \n719 (9th Cir. 2011).  “The absence of any statutory factors to guide the agency’s decision-\n5\nmaking process, in combination with the open-ended nature of the inquiry, generally supports the \n6\nconclusion that the agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.”  Tamenut v. \n7\nMukasey, 521 F.3d 1000, 1004 (8th Cir. 2008) (internal quotations omitted).  Thus, review is \n8\nunavailable where there is insufficient “law to apply” in reviewing the agency’s action.  Newman \n9\nv. Apfel, 232 F.3d 937, 943 (9th Cir. 2000).   \n10\nThis court lacks jurisdiction to review USCIS’s compliance with 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b)’s \n11\n10-day adjudication goal because the determination of whether there are exceptional \n12 circumstances is a discretionary determination.  As the regulation states, USCIS does not need to \n13 make a reasonable fear determination within 10 days when there are exceptional circumstances.  \n14 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b).  However, the determination that exceptional circumstances exist is \ndiscretionary, because there is no meaningful legal standard by which to measure this \n15\ndetermination.  The regulation does not define what constitutes an “exceptional circumstance.”  \n16\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 208.31.  Even more, Plaintiffs do not put forward in their complaint a standard by \n17\nwhich to measure whether exceptional circumstances exist.  The explanatory comments do not \n18\nexplain, define, or contemplate what was considered an “exceptional circumstance.”  See 64 Fed. \n19\nReg. at 8,485.  The discretionary nature of the “exceptional  circumstances” determination is \n20\nfurther reinforced by the immigration statute that treats provisions similar to “exceptional \n21\ncircumstances” as discretionary.  See, e.g., Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 926, 929-30 \n22 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that the phrase “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” at 8 U.S.C. \n23 § 1229b(b)(1)(D) is discretionary).  Thus, this regulation “is drawn so that a court would have no \n24 meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Lincoln v. \nVigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993).   \n25\n  The regulatory language clearly shows that USCIS’s determination regarding whether \n26\nexceptional circumstances are present is discretionary.  Even more, neither the statute nor the \n27\nregulations provide a legal standard by which to measure USCIS’s discretion.  Therefore, this \n28\nCourt lacks jurisdiction under the APA to review whether USCIS has complied with the \n  12   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page21 of 27\n \nregulation.  Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, this Court should \n1\ndismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)  \n2\nD.  Lastly, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that USCIS violated 8 C.F.R. \n3 § 208.31(b).   \n4   Lastly, Plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because \nPlaintiffs have failed to plead that any delay by USCIS is unreasonable as a matter of law.  In \n5\nevaluating a claim of unreasonable delay under the APA, this Court considers the following \n6\nfactors: \n7\n(1) the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a rule of \n8 reason[;] (2) where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the \nspeed with which it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that \n9\nstatutory scheme may supply content for this rule of reason [;] (3) delays that \n10 might be reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when \nhuman health and welfare are at stake [;] (4) the court should consider the effect \n11\nof expediting delayed action on agency activities of a higher or competing \npriority[;] (5) the court should also take into account the nature and extent of the \n12\ninterests prejudiced by the delay[;] and (6) the court need not find any impropriety \n13 lurking behind agency lassitude in order to hold that agency action is \nunreasonably delayed. \n14\n \nBrower v. Evans, 257 F.3d 1058, 1068-69 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Telecommunications \n15\nResearch and Action Center v. FCC (“TRAC”), 750 F.2d 70, 80 (D.D.C. 1984)) (internal \n16\ncitations and quotations omitted) (“TRAC factors”).  The analysis of an unreasonable delay claim \n17\nis a “complicated and nuanced task” because this Court needs to consider the particular facts and \n18\ncircumstances of the delay.  See Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council, Inc. v. Norton, 336 F.3d \n19\n1094, 1100 (D.D.C. 2003). \n20\n  As a preliminary matter, this Court should apply the TRAC factors because the 10-day \n21\ntimeframe at 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) is neither a statutory deadline nor a firm deadline.  See \n22 Biodiversity Legal Found. v. Badgley, 309 F.3d 1166, 1177 (9th Cir. 2002).  While the Ninth \n23 Circuit has declined to apply the TRAC factors where a congressionally-imposed statutory \n24 deadline is present, see Biodiversity Legal Found., 309 F.3d at 1177 n.11, the 10-day timeframe \non 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) is regulatory.  More importantly, however, the 10-day timeframe in the \n25\nregulation is not an absolute deadline imposed by the regulation, and one that USCIS aspires to \n26\nabide by when “exceptional circumstances” are not present.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b).  Thus, the \n27\n10-day regulatory timeframe is not demanded by law in such a way that it automatically results \n28\nin a breach when the deadline is not met.  Cf. Biodiversity Legal Found., 309 F.3d at 1177; \n  13   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page22 of 27\n \nCenter for Food Safety v. Hamburg, 954 F. Supp. 2d 965, 968 (N.D. Cal. 2013).  Therefore, the \n1\nTRAC factors are appropriate to review USCIS’s compliance with 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b). \n2\n  1.  Rule of reason \n3\n  The “rule of reason” factor weighs heavily in favor of USCIS because, due to exceptional \n4\ncircumstances, a delay of more than 10 days is not unreasonable as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs \n5 allege that USCIS renders reasonable fear determinations in about 60 days7 and that such delay \n6 violates 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) because it is more than 10 days.  Compl. ¶¶ 29, 71-79.  The length \n7 of a delay alone is not dispositive, but it is a fact-specific inquiry that depends on the complexity \nof each case.  See Gelfer v. Chertoff, 2007 WL 902382, at * 2 (N.D. Cal. 2007).  USCIS \n8\ncurrently faces high volumes of cases in which it needs to render a reasonable fear determination.  \n9\nSee Mura Decl., Tbl. 3; Lafferty Decl. ¶¶ 25-28.  For example, between fiscal year 2009 and \n10\n2013, USCIS has seen reasonable fear referrals increase from 1,109 to 7,735 – an increase of 597 \n11\npercent.  Mura Decl., Tbl. 3.  Furthermore, delays beyond 10 days are caused by multiple reasons \n12\nincluding an alien’s request for an attorney, availability of interview space and interpreters, and \n13\nthe number of Asylum Officers available.  Mora Decl. Tbl. 2; Lafferty Decl. ¶¶ 8-28.  Even \n14\nmore, the large volume of cases referred to USCIS, delays attributable to the aliens, and lack of \n15\nresources amount to exceptional circumstances that justify USCIS’s adjudication periods.  See 8 \n16 C.F.R. § 208.31(b).  Further, as required by the regulations, USCIS relies on Asylum Officers to \n17 conduct reasonable fear determinations and, due to these officers’ specialized training and \nexpertise, USCIS cannot allocate other employees to conduct the Asylum Officers’ duties.  \n18\nLafferty Decl. ¶¶ 3, 9, 16; see 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b)-(c).  Plaintiffs make no allegation in their \n19\n20\n                                                                 \n21 7   Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that it takes an average of 111 days from the moment a \nperson is taken into custody until a reasonable fear determination is issued, and 49 days for \n22\nUSCIS “to accept jurisdiction” over a case.  Compl ¶ 29.  The time ICE detains an alien before \n23 referral to USCIS and the time ICE takes before a case is referred to USCIS are irrelevant to the \nanalysis of whether USCIS has unreasonably delayed adjudication of reasonable fear \n24\ndeterminations.  A case cannot be referred to USCIS for a reasonable fear determination until a \nfinal administrative removal order or notice of reinstatement of a prior removal order is issued.  8 \n25\nC.F.R. § 208.31(b).  During such time, ICE must comply with its own regulations to determine if \n26 an alien is subject to a final administrative order of removal or reinstatement of a prior removal \norder, including notice and an opportunity to contest the determination.  See 8 C.F.R. \n27\n§§ 238.1(b)-(d); 241.8(a)-(b).  Thus, the only relevant period to Plaintiffs’ claim of unreasonable \ndelay is the period between when ICE refers the alien’s case to USCIS and when USCIS renders \n28\nits reasonable fear determination.   \n  14   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page23 of 27\n \ncomplaint that in spite of the vast increase in reasonable fear referrals to USCIS and the multiple \n1\nreasons causing delays, including lack of agency resources, USCIS’s delays are unreasonable.  \n2\nSee Compl.  Given these circumstances, a delay of 60 days as alleged by Plaintiffs in their \n3\ncomplaint is not unreasonable, and the rule of reason factor weighs in favor of the Government.   \n4\n 2.  Statutory scheme \n5\n  Under the second TRAC factor, this Court must consider whether Congress intended to \n6 impose a timetable.  TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80.  However, because the statute imposes no timetable \n7 for USCIS’s reasonable fear determination, this factor also weighs in the Government’s favor. \n8 3.  Implications for health or human welfare and interests prejudiced by the \ndelay.  \n9\n  The third and fifth TRAC factors consider the impact of agency action on health and \n10\nhuman welfare, and the nature and extent of the interest prejudiced by the agency’ action.  \n11\nTRAC, 750 F.2d at 80.  These two factors generally overlap.  See Kashkool v. Chertoff¸ 553 F. \n12 Supp. 2d 1131, 1145 (D. Ariz. 2008).  The Government does not contest that health or human \n13 welfare factors are implicated in USCIS’s reasonable fear determinations.  Cf. Kashkool, 553 F. \n14 Supp. 2d at 1145 (finding that adjustment of status applications implicate health or human \nwelfare).  However, given the nature of Plaintiffs’ claims, a delay of an average of 60 days as \n15\npleaded by Plaintiffs is not unreasonable.   \n16\n  First, while aliens may be detained while reasonable fear determinations are pending, \n17\nsuch detention is not per se improper.  As such, the aliens are immediately subject to mandatory \n18\npost-order detention under 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(2).  See, e.g., Santos v. Sabol, 2014 WL 2532491, at \n19\n*3-6 (M.D. Pa. 2014) (stating that reinstated removal orders are final administrative orders from \n20\nthe moment of reinstatement).  Under section 1231(a)(2), post-order aliens may be detained for a \n21\nperiod of ninety days, which is well within the current adjudication period of 60 days pleaded by \n22 Plaintiffs.  Thus, any claim of detention as a harm is lessened by the fact that detention is \n23 statutorily mandated for these aliens.   \n24   Second, there is an equally or more important competing interest in reaching accurate \nreasonable fear determinations:  avoiding erroneous return of aliens with valid claims to \n25\ncountries where they may be subject to harm.  Mindful of this task, USCIS implements \n26\nprocedural safeguards and review mechanisms to fulfill its mission to reach correct reasonable \n27\nfear determinations.  See Lafferty Decl. ¶¶ 15-24.  Even more, the task of adjudicating \n28\nreasonable fear determinations rests on Asylum Officers, and due to the Asylum Officers’ \n  15   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page24 of 27\n \nspecialized training, their tasks cannot be assigned to other USCIS employees.  See Lafferty \n1\nDecl. ¶¶ 3, 9-10, 27-28.  A moderate delay is preferable over ordering USCIS to utilize its scarce \n2\nresources to reach reasonable fear determinations within 10 days, which could in turn increase \n3\nthe risk of erroneous determinations.  Thus, the third and fifth TRAC factors favor the \n4\nGovernment.  \n5\n  4.  Effect of expediting agency action. \n6  The  fourth TRAC factor considers the effect of compelling expedited agency action on \n7 other agency activities of a higher or competing priority.  TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80.  Traditionally, \ncourts avoid interfering with an agency’s operation and discretion in determining its priorities.  \n8\nSee In re Barr Laboratories, 930 F.2d 72, 74 (D.D.C. 1991) (“[R]espect for the autonomy and \n9\ncomparative institutional advantage of the executive branch has traditionally made courts slow to \n10\nassume command over an agency’s choice of priorities.”).  Courts also consider this factor \n11\nkeeping in mind that the agency is in a “unique – and authoritative – position” to consider its \n12\nprojects and resources.  Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council, 336 F.3d at 1101.  Here, the \n13\neffects of compelling USCIS to make reasonable fear determinations within 10 days would \n14\nhinder Asylum Office operations by taking resources away from other programs of the agency.  \n15\nLafferty Decl. ¶¶ 3, 9, 31.  As discussed above, USCIS has seen an increase of 597 percent in \n16 reasonable fear cases referred since 2009.  Mura Decl. Tbl. 4.  USCIS has also seen a similarly \n17 dramatic increase in the number of cases that have been referred for credible fear determinations, \nrising from 5,369 cases in fiscal year 2009 to 36,035 in fiscal year 2013 – a 571 percent increase.  \n18\nMura Decl. Tbl. 4.  Furthermore, the agency is best positioned to balance its budget and \n19\nresources in order to determine how to best address these dramatic increases in cases.  See \n20\nMashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council, 336 F.3d at 1101.  Any order requiring USCIS to \n21\nadjudicate reasonable fear determinations within 10 days would seriously hinder USCIS’s ability \n22\nto adjudicate credible fear determinations, as well as affirmative asylum applications.  Lafferty \n23\nDecl. 3, 9, 31.  This will cause precisely the impairment in other programs of the Asylum \n24\nDivision that courts seek to avoid – programs that are equally as important as the reasonable fear \n25\ndeterminations that Plaintiffs seek to expedite.  Therefore, this TRAC factor weighs in favor of \n26 the Government.   \n27  \n28  \n  16   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page25 of 27\n \n  5.  Evidence of impropriety behind the delay \n1\n The  last TRAC factor considers whether there is any impropriety behind the agency’s \n2\ndelay.  TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80.  Plaintiffs have pleaded no fact to support any allegation that \n3\nUSCIS engaged in bad faith or other impropriety against Plaintiffs or any putative class member.  \n4\nTherefore, this factor weighs in favor of the Government.   \n5\nWhen considered together, the TRAC factors weigh in favor of the conclusion that USCIS \n6 has not engaged in an unreasonable delay.  Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts sufficient to \n7 support finding that the time that it takes USCIS to render reasonable fear determinations is an \nunreasonable delay under the APA.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ \n8\ncomplaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.   \n9\n// \n10\n \n11\n// \n12\n   \n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n  17   \n\n \nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document43   Filed07/17/14   Page26 of 27\n \nV.  CONCLUSION \n1\n  Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed as it relates to their individual claims because \n2\ntheir claims are moot.  Furthermore, the entire complaint, including Plaintiffs’ putative class \n3\nclaims, should be dismissed because 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) does not create a mandatory 10-day \n4\ntimeline or an enforceable right to adjudication within 10 days.  Additionally, dismissal is \n5\nappropriate because USCIS’s discretionary determination of whether exceptional circumstances \n6 exist is not subject to review under the APA.  Lastly, a delay of 60 days in reaching reasonable \n7 fear determinations as pleaded by Plaintiffs are not unreasonable as a matter of law.  Therefore, \nthis Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint.   \n8\nDATED:  July 14, 2014      Respectfully submitted. \n9\n \n10 STUART F.

According to Defendants’ Motion \n6 to Dismiss (“Motion”), Plaintiffs—noncitizens who fled their home countries and have expressed \n7 fear of persecution or torture if they are returned—cannot be heard on their claims that the \n8 Defendants willfully and systematically failed to adhere to a binding regulation requiring Defendants \n9 to perform screening interviews, and bring Plaintiffs’ request for refuge to immigration judges \n10 within a prescribed 10-day period. Instead, Defendants Johnson, Rodriguez and Langlois, and the \nware  11 immigration agencies for which they hold ultimate responsibility, believe they can ignore this rule, \nDela\nof \nTH LLP  med in the State  1123 uanndil aintedreaflilnyi teexltye ndde ttahien  bthrioesfe p werhioo dh aavlleo wsoeudg ahsty plruomte octfifoicne wrsi tthoi np roeulirm bionradrielrys .a Bssye sdso pinrogt esoct, itohne scela ims, \nREED SMImited liability partnership for 111456 ot ofrftiucriael stBo au gnti dtv heteh u elp aaw gth,e ena sch ioienpste et hrtpherayet t atedhdmi sa innndaist aitorpanpt’elsi e cidad uebsayel s at ho nofu sfmere bseeedero komifn  gcaon pudrr otthtse,e c drtoiuoelnes   ofnrfoo tlm agw ipv eaerp stphelecysu ettoi oD tnhe feaemnnd.d  ants \nA li\n17 the unfettered discretion to disregard clear and mandatory regulatory language. Nor do these \n18 Defendants stand immune from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, long established judicial \n19 precedent regarding the viability of claims brought by an inherently transitory class, or the \n20 requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. Thus, their claims of mootness, challenges to \n21 subject matter jurisdiction, and vague references to “exceptional circumstances” (never pled in the \n22 complaint, nor even identified in the materials these Defendants improperly submit on a motion to \n23 dismiss), do not provide a basis to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ complaint. Instead, this Court must deny \n24 Defendants’ Motion for at least the following reasons:  \n25 First:  Because this is an inherently transitory class, the class claims do not become moot \n26 simply because the Defendants belatedly provided the Named Plaintiffs with \n27 reasonable fear determinations after the class complaint was filed but prior to a ruling \n28 on class certification (seeSection I);\n(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:484)(cid:22)(cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:484)(cid:495)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:486)(cid:3) 1(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:136)(cid:3)21(cid:3)\n\nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document54   Filed08/18/14   Page7 of 26\n1 Second:  As numerous other courts have held with respect to similar statutory and regulatory \n2 deadlines, the Court can enforce 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) because this regulation bestows \n3 important procedural protections on Class Members seeking protection under the \n4 immigration laws (see Section II); and  \n5 Third:  Even without the mandate of the 10-day rule, this Court must allow Plaintiffs’ claims \n6 to proceed as the complaint alleges that the Defendants have “unreasonably” delayed \n7 the issuance of reasonable fear determinations. In arguing to the contrary, Defendants \n8 improperly rely on evidence outside the complaint—which the Court cannot consider \n9 on a motion to dismiss. Moreover, that evidence in fact only substantiates the fact that \n10 the Defendants systematically and openly delay conducting determinations, and \nware  11 thereby unnecessarily prolong the detention of Class Members without justification \nDela\nof \nTH LLP  med in the State  1123 (see Section III). \nREED SMImited liability partnership for 111456 becauseT thhiesy c faesaer  cpoenrcseecrBnuAsti aoC npK uoGtra RttoivOrteuU crNela Disns   AtohfNe niDro h nSocTmitAiez NecnoDsu AwnRthriDoe s sO.e UeFk.

(See Compl. [Dkt. 1] ¶¶ 19-\n20 22.) Among these is a regulatory provision allowing U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services \n21 (“USCIS”) up to 10 days – and only 10 days in the absence of exceptional circumstances – to \n22 determine whether an individual has expressed a “reasonable fear” of persecution or torture, and to \n23 refer individuals determined to have a “reasonable fear” to an immigration law judge for a full \n24 hearing on their claims for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b). Yet despite this clear regulatory mandate, \n25 Defendants have “rarely” complied with this obligation, leaving Class Members to “languish in \n26 detention for months and, in some cases, over a year” at great emotional, physical, and financial cost \n27 to Class Members and their families. (See id. ¶¶ 7, 31-59 (describing drastic human consequences” \n28 caused by Defendants’ violations, including depression, despair, and financial and emotional \n(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:484)(cid:22)(cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:484)(cid:495)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:486)(cid:3) 2(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:136)(cid:3)21(cid:3)\n\nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document54   Filed08/18/14   Page8 of 26\n1 deprivation).)  To correct this persistent violation of duty, Plaintiffs seek relief under the \n2 Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Mandamus and Venue Act to compel Defendants to \n3 comply with their mandatory legal obligations, and to cease their “unreasonable” delays in \n4 processing Plaintiffs’ claims for relief. (See id. ¶¶ 8, 71-79.)\n5 To prevail on a motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(6), Defendants must demonstrate that \n6 Plaintiffs’ complaint does not set forth facts sufficient to establish a “plausible” right to relief. Bell\n7 Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007). In considering Defendants’ Motion, this \n8 Court’s “[r]eview is limited to the contents of the complaint,” and it must accept all factual \n9 allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. \n10 Sprewell v.

Cal. 2008).\n20   Plaintiffs’ claims that Defendants’ lengthy, unjustified delays in conducting reasonable fear \n21 determinations—in direct violation of a binding regulation—are “unreasonable” are clearly \n22 plausible, and this Court must therefore deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  \n23 ARGUMENT \n24 I. As Plaintiffs Seek to  Represent an Inherently Tran sitory Cla ss, the Court has \nJurisdiction to Hear Their Claims. \n25\n  As the Defendants freely concede (Dkt. 38 at 7 n.6.),where an individual seeks to represent a \n26\nclass with inherently transitory claims—as the Named Plaintiffs seek to do here—the resolution of \n27\ntheir individual claims on the merits does not moot the class action allegations. See County of \n28\n(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:484)(cid:22)(cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:484)(cid:495)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:486)(cid:3) 3(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:136)(cid:3)21(cid:3)\n\nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document54   Filed08/18/14   Page9 of 26\n1 Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52-53 (1991); Wade v. Kirkland, 118 F.3d 667, 670 (9th Cir. \n2 1997). Even where “the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs’ claims had \n3 become moot,” mootness of their individual claims does “not deprive [the Court] of jurisdiction” \n4 because “some claims are so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time \n5 to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative’s individual interest \n6 expires.”  McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 52-53 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, if \n7 the claims in a class action case “are indeed ‘inherently transitory,’ then the action qualifies for an \n8 exception to mootness even if there is no indication that [the named plaintiff] or other current class \n9 members may again be subject to the acts that gave rise to the claims” as such “a constantly \n10 changing putative class that will become subject to the[] allegedly unconstitutional conditions.” \nware  11 Wade,118 F.3d at 670 (internal citation omitted). \nDela\nof \nTH LLP  med in the State  1123  explaineHde irne ,t thheei rc clalassss t hcee rNtifaimcaetdio Pnl bairnietiffifnsg s, eienkd itvoi dreuparlse sweniltl  ijso iinn htheree cnltalyss t raasn tshietoyr ye.x Aprse sPsl aai nfetiafrf so f \nREED SMImited liability partnership for 111456 rc4eo.)tmu Jrpunlsietn tlgeid kt oei n tth htehe iecri orh ucoramts ceeos cn. os(uPidnleatrriniientsigf, f tashn’e dR c eelaxpiilmty  tsihn ea  sScsuleaprstpseo dor tni nco efM  MthcLeo atrieuoagnsh ofloninra —bCllewa sfhese aCrre ed cretoitfueirncmtaytii nodanett ia[oDinnk epter. so4 c0e]s as ti s \nA li\n17 sought timely probable cause determinations—this Court has not had time to reach the issue of class \n18 certification before the Named Plaintiffs’ individual claims became moot. See McLaughlin, 500 U.S. \n19 at 52. Nevertheless, “it is certain that other persons similarly situated will have the same complaint,” \n20 Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc., 653 F.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. 2011), that is, that Defendants will \n21 continue to violate the mandatory regulation and fail to provide reasonable fear determinations \n22 within the mandated 10-day period or within a reasonable amount of time. As with the Named \n23 Plaintiffs, if individuals similarly aggrieved by Defendants’ unlawful conduct bring separate actions \n24 in the future, their reasonable fear determinations—although issued months after the 10-day period \n25 allotted for such government action, as in the case of the Named Plaintiffs—such individuals claims \n26 would most certainly moot by the time the Court reached the class certification issue.  \n27 Because this case involves “a constantly changing putative class that will become subject to \n28 these allegedly [unlawful practices],” Wade, 118 F.3d at 670, the case involves “inherently \n(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:484)(cid:22)(cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:484)(cid:495)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:486)(cid:3) 4(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:136)(cid:3)21(cid:3)\n\nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document54   Filed08/18/14   Page10 of 26\n1 transiitory” claimss.

To the \n22 contrrary, the Suppreme Court has held thaat “when an aagency is coompelled by law to act wwithin a \n23 certaiin time periood . . . a courrt can compeel the agencyy to act . . .” Norton v.

Supp. 2d 1158, 1169 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (ordering the government \n4 to comply with specific procedures, including deadlines, for processing applications for adjustment \n5 of status).\n6 Defendants’ more limited argument that they need not comply with the regulation at issue \n7 here “because it is an internal administrative processing guideline,” (Defs.’ Br. [Dkt.43] at 8.), also \n8 fails. The 10-day regulation is enforceable because it confers important procedural rights upon the \n9 Plaintiff Class by ensuring that the government’s desire to preliminarily assess a petitioner’s \n10 reasonable fear will not impede a fair and timely hearing of her claims for relief.

This is so even where the internal \n19 procedures are possibly more rigorous than otherwise would be required.” 415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974). \n20   Here, 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) confers important procedural benefits on Class Members by \n21 ensuring that immigration judges hear their claims for protection in the United States in a timely \n22 manner, and that they not suffer prolonged periods of detentions while immigration officers process \n23 their claims. While Defendants argue that the regulations containing the 10-day limitation exist only \n24 to benefit immigration authorities, i.e., that this regulation was “intended to ensure that [noncitizens] \n25 do not use the reasonable fear process to delay their removal by making frivolous claims,” (Defs.’ \n26 Mot. at 10-11.), this claim cannot be reconciled with the fact that the regulation was enacted to \n27 implement the Convention Against Torture, which plainly was established to provide protections to \n28 those who fear torture.

(SeeDefs.’ Mot. at 15 (noting the government’s position that noncitizens \n20 in reasonable fear determination process are subject to mandatory detention)) Because any agency \n21 delay in completing the reasonable fear determination process necessarily delays the rest of the \n22 noncitizen’s immigration case, Defendants’ violation of the regulation results in months of \n23 unnecessary detention even before a noncitizen has a chance to present his or her claim before the \n24 immigration courts. The 10-day regulatory timeline, therefore, provides another important \n25 procedural protection to the noncitizen, namely, a reduction in the overall amount of detention the \n26 noncitizen must endure while his or her claims are fully adjudicated on the merits. \n27   Because the regulation confers an important procedural right on the noncitizen, the cases \n28 upon which Defendants rely are inapposite.

That alone ends consideration of Defendants’ “exceptional circumstances” claim on a \n3 motion to dismiss. It is of further note, however, that Defendants’ Motion conspicuously lacks any \n4 indication that Defendants in fact made a determination that “exceptional circumstances” are present \n5 here. Defendants merely claim that the presence of the exception in the regulation renders this Court \n6 incapable of evaluating Defendants’ compliance with the regulation, regardless of whether they \n7 believe such “exceptional circumstances” apply in any Class Member’s case. The Court should \n8 therefore reject Defendants’ argument. See Dong, 513 F. Supp. 2d at 1168 (refusing to find \n9 exception to visa adjudication timelines applicable because government failed to expressly invoke \n10 exception, or provide evidence that exception applies); Elmalky v.

Id. at 823. The Supreme Court \n20 held that the plaintiffs’ claims were barred by APA § 701(a)(2), which precludes judicial review \n21 over actions committed to agency discretion by law. Id. at 832. The Court found that the decision to \n22 initiate an enforcement action was unreviewable because there was “no meaningful standard against \n23 which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion”: “an agency decision not to enforce often \n24 9 Defendants’ improperly submitted “evidence” in fact belies any suggestion that the delays \nexperienced by class members are “exceptional.” Defendants’ declarations reveal that Defendants \n25\nhave not complied with their obligation to conduct reasonable determinations for at least 14 years, \nand that there is therefore nothing “exceptional” about the agencies’ current burdens. (See\n26\nDeclaration of Elizabeth E. Mura, Headquarters Asylum Officer, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (“Mura Decl.”), Table 3.) Moreover, while the agency has experienced an increase in cases, \n27\nthe increase has occurred at a gradual rate for the past 14 years—undermining any claim that the \nagency could not predict, and plan for, its current caseload. (See id., Table 4.) \n28\n(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:484)(cid:22)(cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:484)(cid:495)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:486)(cid:3) 15(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:136)(cid:3)21(cid:3)\n\nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document54   Filed08/18/14   Page21 of 26\n1 involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise” \n2 and the “agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the \n3 proper ordering of its priorities.” Id. at 830-32. Accordingly, the Court adopted a “presumption of \n4 unreviewability” over an agency’s prosecutorial discretion in taking enforcement actions. Id. at 832-\n5 33.\n6 Heckler’s concerns regarding the practicality of judicial review over agency prosecutorial \n7 discretion are clearly inapplicable here for at least three reasons. First, unlike the enforcement \n8 actions at issue in Heckler, Defendants have a non-discretionary duty to conduct reasonable fear \n9 determinations within a “reasonable” period under the APA. A regulation can establish what \n10 constitutes such a “reasonable” period even if it involves some element of discretion. See Dong, 513 \nware  11 F. Supp. 2d at 1168 (rejecting argument that regulation providing immigration official discretion to \nDela\nof \nTH LLP  med in the State  1123 ecxlatiemnd).  pSeerei ogde noef rtaimllye Mtoa azdojuucdhici avt.e S vtiilsla,  2d0iv0e7s tUs .cSo. uDrti sot.f  LjuEriXsdISic 5ti3o9n9 t9o,  caot n*s1id4e (rN u.nDr.e Casaoln. aJubllye  d1e0l,a y \nREED SMImited liability partnership for 111456 2Hp0oe0scs7ke)ls e(srq  uupnorfeteicntltuged rKeedsim  rde ivvs.ci eArewsthi oocfnr o atfnot,   ur3en4lre0eg aFast.oe Sn aualbpielpen.  sd2 tedol a 3ay8  s4ct,la a3tie9m o3 f a( n‘Sld.iDm h.boNold.,Y’in .l ge2a 0tvh0ian4tg) “)  t[(hUreeSmje]C cttoIiS nl gasn iamgrugpiulsymh  dethoneet rste hn aot t \nA li\n17 indefinitely”). Because the Court can look to the regulation in determining whether Defendants have \n18 complied with their mandatory duty to conduct reasonable fear determinations within a “reasonable \n19 period,” the application of that regulation is not wholly “committed to agency action by law.” \n20 Second, the question of whether there are “exceptional circumstances” warranting delay in \n21 conducting a reasonable fear determination is not the type of purely discretionary decision that is \n22 immune from judicial review under Heckler. The Ninth Circuit has rejected Heckler’s applicability \n23 and found that it has jurisdiction to review the application of similar terminology in the immigration \n24 laws. See Husyev v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 1172, 1181 (9th Cir. 2008) (whether petitioner filed for \n25 asylum within a “reasonable period” after the expiration of his lawful status); Taslimi v.

Holder, 656 F.3d 1047, \n2 1051 (9th Cir. 2011) (whether petitioner met “changed circumstances” and “extraordinary \n3 circumstances” exceptions to asylum filing deadline) (citing Husyev and Ramadan v. Gonzales, 479 \n4 F.3d 646 (9th Cir. 2007)); Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2007) (whether \n5 petitioner met the “due diligence” requirement to reopen an immigration case).11 As the Ninth \n6 Circuit explained in Ramadan, while terms such as “changed circumstances” “involve the exercise \n7 of judgment,” they are not purely discretionary because they “do[] not depend upon the identity of \n8 the person or entity examining the issue,” and are “less value-laden and do[] not reflect the decision \n9 maker’s beliefs in and assessment of worth and principle” than determinations such as “the quality \n10 of an alien’s moral character.” Ramadan, 479 F.3d at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nware  11 The determination of “exceptional circumstances” is no more discretionary than \nDela\nof \nTH LLP  med in the State  1123 d“detueer mdiilnigaetinocnes. ”o fI n“deexetrda,o Drdeifneanrdya cnitrsc cuomnscteadnec eths,a”t  “thcihsa Cngoeudr tc hiracsu jmursitsadniccetiso,”n  ato “ dreeatesormnainbele w pheeritohde”r  or \nREED SMImited liability partnership for 111456 tachnaend   drtheevleairyeewsfo i rnteh  ceao ctnikmdnueoclwitnilneegsds gr eoea ft shroeanat astbohlneera ebf elaear ref  edsaeurtf efdriemctieienrnmattliiyno a“ntmsi oaenraesn. i “Tnrgehafiuss olC nsotaaubnrldte a,c”ra d(nss e”the be Dyre ewffoshr.ie’c  Mhre tvohitie.s wa Ct  w1o3uh.re)tt,  her \nA li\n17 there are “exceptional circumstances” that justify the lengthy delays at issue here because such \n18 review does “depend upon the identity of the person or entity examining the issue” and does not \n19 “reflect the decision maker’s beliefs in and assessment of worth and principle.” Ramadan, 479 F.3d \n20 at 656.\n21 10 While the regulations at issue in Husyev and Taslimi provided some additional guidance regarding \nwhat constitutes a “reasonable period,” the Ninth Circuit did not limit its analysis to whether the \n22\nagency followed these guidelines and instead determined whether the delay was “reasonable” as a \nmatter of law.  \n23\n11 Singh, Ghahremani, and Ramadan concern the applicability of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which \n24\nbars judicial review of a “decision or action” which is “specified” as discretionary by the \nimmigration laws. That bar is more “powerful” than the APA bar on review of discretionary \n25\ndeterminations, and thus “any determination that passes the more stringent [Section \n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)] test, remaining subject to judicial review, also passes the lower bar of the APA \n26\ntest.” Ana Int’l v. Way, 393 F.3d 886, 890-891 (9th Cir. 2004). Defendants have not claimed that \nSection 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) applies here—nor could they, as the Ninth Circuit has construed the bar to \n27\napply only to determinations specified as discretionary by statute. See Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft,\n371 F.3d 520, 528 (9th Cir. 2004). \n28\n(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:484)(cid:22)(cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:484)(cid:495)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:486)(cid:3) 17(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:136)(cid:3)21(cid:3)\n\nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document54   Filed08/18/14   Page23 of 26\n1 Third,Heckler applies where an agency makes an individualized determination to exercise \n2 purely discretionary authority. That is far different than the circumstances presented here, where \n3 Defendants apparently take the position that they need not abide by the 10-day requirement as a \n4 rule, regardless of individual circumstances in any given case.12 The existence of a safety valve to be \n5 applied in individual cases does not preclude the court from enjoining Defendants’ policy and \n6 practice of imposing systemic delays in violation of a binding regulation. To conclude otherwise \n7 would eviscerate the Court’s authority under the APA as well as the clear meaning of the regulation.  \n8 III. Defendants’ Lengthy, Unjustified Delays are Not “Reasonable” As a Matter of Law. \n9 Relying on hundreds of pages of “evidence” outside the pleadings, Defendants ask this Court \n10 to declare that the prolonged delays experienced by class members are “reasonable” as a matter of \nware  11 law under the six-factor, fact-intensive test established by Telecommunications Research Action \nDela\nof \nTH LLP  med in the State  1123 Catetenmteprt v t.o F lCitiCg,a t7e5 t0h eF .r2eda s7o0n a(Dbl.eCn.e Cssi ro. f1 t9h8e4ir)  s(“yTstReAmCic” )v.i o(Slaetei oDnes fos’f  M8 Cot..F a.Rt 1. 3§- 21078.). 3B1u(tb )D neofewn,d aatn tthse’  \nREED SMImited liability partnership for 111456 psaunlefdaf idacriingegunsec  yst htoaefg  ueP,nl aidsie nsrtluiyfbifsnst’ga  cnmotimevrepitllsya  ioanfnt ;dt h ipte  ridos icnsepodutu taer a.v lHelyhe ibrceal,ec w kfowhrea rDrede stfh.e eAn dc moanmottspi oltaoni  nitnot t crdhoiasdmlulecisnesg u etnesst egtsso ttvehdeer  envmideenntacle  \nA li\n17 delays that have resulted in immigrants “languish[ing] in detention for months and, in some cases, \n18 over a year,” Defendants’ motion to dismiss must be denied. (See Compl. ¶ 7.) See also Daohua\n19 Chen v. Chertoff, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4891, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2008) (denying motion to \n20 dismiss because “[w]hat constitutes an unreasonable delay in the context of immigration applications \n21 depends to a great extent on the facts of the particular case”). \n22\n12 Even when it comes to discretionary determinations, courts have jurisdiction to review \n23\n“categorical rules” that constrain the exercise of that discretion. For example, the Ninth Circuit has \nheld that it has jurisdiction to consider the BIA’s “categorical rule” regarding the application of \n24\n“exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” determinations, even though that determination is \ngenerally committed to agency discretion. See Arteaga-De Alvarez v. Holder, 704 F.3d 730, 738-739 \n25\n(9th Cir. 2012). For that reason, the Defendants’ reliance on Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d \n926, 929-30 (9th Cir. 2005) is completely unavailing. (See Deft. Br. [Dkt. 43] at 12 (citing Martinez-\n26\nRosasand claiming that “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” determinations are \ndiscretionary and not subject to judicial review)). Therefore, Defendants’ blanket characterization \n27\nthe “exceptional circumstances” language would constitute a categorical rule that is not “committed \nto agency discretion by law.” \n28\n(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:484)(cid:22)(cid:495)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:484)(cid:495)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:484)(cid:3)(cid:486)(cid:3) 18(cid:3)(cid:145)(cid:136)(cid:3)21(cid:3)\n\nCase4:14-cv-01775-YGR   Document54   Filed08/18/14   Page24 of 26\n1 A.

(“defendants”) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  seeking review of processes employed by the Asylum Division of the United States Citizenship \n19  and Immigration Services (“USCIS”).  The gravamen of the complaint alleges a failure to conduct \n20  in a timely manner “reasonable fear” determinations under 8 C.F.R. section 208.31(b) (“Section \n21  208.31(b)”).  Plaintiffs contend that USCIS is required to complete such determinations within 10 \n22  days of referral to an asylum officer, but that the government has essentially abdicated its duty to \n23  comply with this mandate.  As a result, plaintiffs allege that individuals are held for months in \n24  detention while they await hearings on their claims.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and mandamus \n25  relief on the following two causes of action:  (1) violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n26 \n                                                 \n27  1 One named plaintiff, Nancy Bardalez Serpa, is no longer a member of the defined class. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs have represented they will voluntarily dismiss her claims.  (Dkt. No. 40 at \n28 \n3 n.1.)  \n\n \n1  (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. sections 555(b) (requiring agency action in a “reasonable time”) and 706(1) \n2  (providing that a reviewing court shall . . . “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \n3  unreasonably delayed”); and (2) violation of Section 208.31, which requires that the USCIS \n4  complete these reasonable fear determinations within 10 days of referral to an asylum officer.  \n5  (Dkt. No. 1 (“Complaint”) at ¶¶ 71-79.)   \n6    Now before the Court are two motions: defendants’ motion to dismiss on the grounds that \n7  this Court lacks jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and that plaintiffs \n8  have failed to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Dkt. No. 43), and \n9  plaintiffs’ motion for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) (Dkt. No. \n10  12).  On September 30, 2014, the Court heard argument on both motions.   \n11  Having carefully considered the papers submitted and the pleadings in this action, the \n12  arguments of counsel presented at the hearing, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  hereby DENIES the motion to dismiss, and GRANTS plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  I.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nrts fo\niD tc 15  A.  Statutory and Regulatory Structure \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  As a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, \nS d nr\nee 17  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”), the United States has agreed not to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “expel, return, (“refouler”) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial \n19  grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture.”  Foreign \n20  Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 § 2242, Pub. L. 105-227, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-821; \n21  see also Regulations Concerning the Convention Against Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8,478-01.  By \n22  statute, an individual may seek withholding of removal if his or her “life or freedom would be \n23  threatened in that country because of [his/her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a \n24  particular social group, or political opinion.”  8 U.S.C. section 1231(b)(3)(A).  If an individual \n25  qualifies for protection, “withholding of removal is mandatory under the [CAT] implementing \n26  regulations.”  Nuru v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2005).   \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\n \n1  On February 19, 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”)2 adopted \n2  interim regulations in an effort to comply with the United States’ international obligations under \n3  the CAT.  See Regulations Concerning the Convention Against Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8,478 (Feb. \n4  19, 1999).  These regulations sought to provide fair and efficient procedures by which the United \n5  States would ensure that individuals who have a reasonable fear of torture and persecution are not \n6  returned to their countries of origin “within the overall regulatory framework for the issuance of \n7  removal orders and decisions about the execution of such order.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 8,479.  “To this \n8  end, [the Agency] designed a system that will allow aliens subject to the various types of removal \n9  proceedings currently afforded by the immigration laws to seek, and where eligible, to be accorded \n10  protection under [the CAT].  At the same time, [the Agency] created mechanisms to quickly \n11  identify and resolve frivolous claims to protection so that the new procedures cannot be used as a \n12  delaying tactic by aliens who are not in fact at risk.”  Id.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Section 208.31 of the regulations applies to two types of individuals subject to removal: \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  those who are subject to reinstatement of removal orders and those who are subject to final \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  administrative orders of removal.  If a person falling into either of those categories expresses a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  fear of return, he or she is subject to a two-part review process to determine if he or she qualifies \nS d nr\nee 17  for withholding of removal or relief.  8 C.F.R. § 208.31(a).  The first step (at issue here) occurs \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  “upon issuance” of the final administrative order or the notice of reinstatement of removal.  An \n19  individual who expresses such fear is referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear \n20  determination.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b).  Of particular relevance to this case is the final sentence \n21  in Section 208.31(b): \n \n22 \n \n(b) Initiation of reasonable fear determination process.  Upon \n23 \nissuance of a Final Administrative Removal Order under §238.1 of \nthis chapter, or notice under §241.8(b) of this chapter that an alien is \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  2 On March 1, 2003, the functions of the former INS were transferred from the Department \nof Justice to three distinct components (United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \n27  United States Customs and Border Protection, and USCIS) in the newly formed Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”).  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. \n28 \n2135 (Nov. 25, 2002). \n3 \n\n \nsubject to removal, an alien described in paragraph (a) of this \n1 \nsection shall be referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear \ndetermination.  In the absence of exceptional circumstances, this \n2 \ndetermination will be conducted within 10 days of the referral. \n3   \n8 C.F.R. § 208.31(b) (emphasis supplied); see also Regulations Concerning the Convention \n4 \nAgainst Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8478-01.  The second step concerns what occurs after that initial \n5 \ndetermination has been rendered.  Persons who are found to have a reasonable fear of persecution \n6 \nor torture are referred to an Immigration Judge for full consideration of their claims for \n7 \nwithholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. section 1231(b)(3), or withholding or deferral of removal \n8 \nunder 8 C.F.R. sections 208.16 and 208.17.  8 C.F.R. § 208.31(e).  A person whom USCIS \n9 \ndetermines not to have a reasonable fear of persecution may request that an Immigration Judge \n10 \nreview USCIS’s determination.  If the Immigration Judge disagrees with USCIS, the person may \n11 \npursue full consideration of his or her reasonable fear claim before the Immigration Judge.  8 \n12 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  C.F.R. § 208.31(f)-(g). \nCfi\n tclaC 14  Plaintiffs allege that the above regulatory process is designed to ensure that reasonable fear \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  claims are heard in a fair and timely manner.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 19- 22.)  According to plaintiffs,  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Section 208.31 requires timely resolution of reasonable fear claims because plaintiffs and other \nS d nr similarly situated individuals are subject to imprisonment while they await reasonable fear \nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo determinations.  (Compl. ¶ 23.)  Despite Section 208.31’s mandate, plaintiffs allege that \nN 18 \ndefendants have “rarely” complied with the 10-day deadline, leaving plaintiffs and others similarly \n19 \nsituated to “languish in detention for months and, in some cases, over a year” at great emotional, \n20 \nphysical, and financial cost to these individuals and their families.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 7, 31-59 \n21 \n(describing harms caused by defendants’ violations, including depression, despair, and financial \n22 \nand emotional deprivation).)  According to the complaint, defendants have wholly abandoned any \n23 \neffort to comply with Section 208.31.  Instead, defendants have developed a new, less demanding \n24 \ntimeframe, effectively supplanting the timeframe set forth in Section 208.31.  \n25 \nPlaintiffs thus seek relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the \n26 \nMandamus and Venue Act to compel defendants to comply with their mandatory legal obligations, \n27 \nand to cease their unreasonable delays in processing plaintiffs’ claims for relief.  (See id. ¶¶ 8, 71-\n28 \n4 \n\n \n1  79.) \n2  B.  Individual Plaintiffs \n3  1.  Marco A. Alfaro Garcia \n4  Plaintiff Alfaro Garcia is a native and citizen of El Salvador.  (Compl. ¶ 9.)  Mr. Alfaro \n5  Garcia first entered the United States on September 12, 2005, at or near Lukeville, Arizona.  \n6  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. 1-B, Form I-205, Warrant of Removal/Deportation.)  On September  28, 2005, \n7  the Immigration Judge ordered that Mr. Alfaro Garcia be removed to El Salvador and he was \n8  removed from the United States on September 29, 2005.  (Id. Ex. 1-B.)  On or about March 2007, \n9  Mr. Alfaro Garcia returned to the United States.  On January 14, 2014, he was arrested in Los \n10  Angeles, California, for driving under the influence, and on January 16, 2014, ICE took him into \n11  custody.  (Id. Ex. 1-A.)  That same day, an ICE officer issued an order reinstating Mr. Alfaro \n12  Garcia’s order of removal to El Salvador.  (Id. Ex. 1-D, I-871, Notice of Intent/Decision to \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Reinstate Prior Order.)  Mr. Alfaro Garcia promptly expressed his fear of returning to El Salvador \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  shortly after being taken into immigration custody, and on January 28, 2014, Mr. Alfaro Garcia \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  was referred to USCIS for a reasonable fear determination.  (Id.  Ex. 1-C, Record of Sworn \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Statement in Administrative Proceedings; Ex. 1-E, Email from Michael McDaniel.)  USCIS \nS d nr\nee 17  interviewed Mr. Alfaro Garcia on or about February 11, 2014.  (Id. Ex. 1-F, Form I-899, Record \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of Determination/Reasonable Fear Worksheet.)  USCIS issued a decision on April 25, 2014, \n19  concluding that Mr. Alfaro Garcia did not have a reasonable fear of persecution in El Salvador. \n20  (Id. Ex. 1-F, Form I-898, Record of Negative Reasonable Finding and Request for Review by \n21  Immigration Judge.)   \n22  Mr. Alfaro Garcia alleges that defendants’ failure to provide him a reasonable fear \n23  determination within the prescribed 10-day period, instead delaying such determination for almost \n24  three months, has harmed him by prolonging his detention and delaying his right to be heard on \n25  his claims for relief. \n26  2.  Credy Madrid Calderon \n27  Plaintiff Madrid Calderon is a native and citizen of Honduras.  (Compl. ¶ 10.)  Mr. Madrid \n28  Calderon first entered the United States on November 28, 2004 at or near Laredo, Texas.  (Defs.’ \n5 \n\n \n1  Mot. Ex. 2-A.)  On May 25, 2005, he was ordered removed to Honduras.  (Id. Ex. 2-B, \n2  Memorandum and Order.)  Mr. Madrid Calderon was removed to Honduras on or about \n3  September 27, 2013. (Id. Ex. 2-C, Form I-871; Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order.)  \n4  Subsequently, on or about March 2, 2014, Mr. Madrid Calderon attempted to reenter the United \n5  States at or near Laredo, Texas, and on March 6, 2014, ICE issued an order reinstating Mr.  \n6  Madrid Calderon’s order of removal.  (Id. Exs. 2-C, 2-D.) On or about April 3, 2014, USCIS \n7  notified Mr. Madrid Calderon that he was scheduled for a reasonable fear interview, which was \n8  conducted or about May 12, 2014.  (Id. Ex. 2-E, Form M-488, Information about Reasonable Fear \n9  Interview; Ex. 2-F, Form I-899, Record of Determination/Reasonable Fear Worksheet.)  On May \n10  29, 2014, USCIS determined that Mr. Madrid Calderon had a reasonable fear of persecution or \n11  torture.  (Id. Ex. 2-G, Form I-863, Notice of Referral to the Immigration Judge.) \n12  Mr. Madrid Calderon alleges that because he did not receive a reasonable fear \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  determination in his case for well in excess of 10 days after being referred for a reasonable fear \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  interview, he was harmed by his prolonged detention and delayed right to be heard on his claim. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  3.  Gustavo Ortega \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiff Ortega is a native and citizen of Mexico.  (Compl. ¶ 11.)  Mr. Ortega first entered \nS d nr\nee 17  the United States in September 2009 at or near Arizona.  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. 3-A.)  On January 23, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2014, Mr. Ortega was convicted of an aggravated felony, to wit, assault with a deadly weapon \n19  likely to cause great bodily injury, in violation of section 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code.  \n20  (Id. Ex. 3-B, Waiver on Plea of Guilty/No Contest, People v. Ortega.)  On February 27, 2014, ICE \n21  issued a final administrative order of removal against Mr. Ortega.  (Id. Ex. 3-C, Form I-851 and \n22  Form I-851A.)  On or about February 26, 2014, Mr. Ortega expressed a fear of return to Mexico.  \n23  (Id. Exs. 3-A; 3-C.) \n24  On or about February 28, 2014, USCIS provided notice to Mr. Ortega that he was \n25  scheduled for a reasonable fear interview.  (Id. Ex. 3-D, Form G-56, Notice of Reasonable Fear \n26  Interview; Ex. 3-E, Form M-488, Information About Reasonable Fear Interview.)  USCIS \n27  interviewed Mr. Ortega on or about March 25, 2014.  (Id. Ex. 3-F, Form I-899, Record of \n28  Determination/Reasonable Fear Worksheet.)  Just over two months later, USCIS issued a decision \n6 \n\n \n1  on April 29, 2014, concluding that Mr. Ortega did not have a reasonable fear of persecution.  (Id. \n2  Ex. 3-G, Form I-898, Record of Negative Reasonable Fear Finding.)  Mr. Ortega claims that \n3  defendants’ failure to provide him a reasonable fear determination within the prescribed 10-day \n4  period prolonged his detention and delayed his right to be heard on his claims for relief. \n5  4.  Claudia Rodriguez de la Torre \n6  Plaintiff Rodriguez is a native and citizen of Mexico.  (Compl. ¶ 12.)  In 1998, Ms. \n7  Rodriguez first entered the United States at or near San Luis, Arizona.  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. 4-A.)  On \n8  January 2, 2014, Ms. Rodriguez was convicted of an aggravated felony, to wit, possession of a \n9  controlled substance for sale in violation of title 40, section 453.337 of the Nevada Revised \n10  Statutes.  (Id. Ex. 4-B, Judgment, State v. Rodriguez-de la Torre, No. CR13-1802 (Washoe Cnty. \n11  Dist. Ct Jan. 2, 2014).) On January 21, 2014, Ms. Rodriguez was issued a final administrative \n12  order of removal.  (Id. Ex. 4-C, Form I-851; Ex. 4-D, Form I-851A.)  That same day, Ms. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Rodriguez expressed a fear of return to Mexico.  (Id.

USCIS interviewed Ortega on or about \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  February 6, 2014.  (Id. Ex. 4-F, Form I-899.)  Approximately three months later, USCIS issued a \nS d nr\nee 17  decision on April 23, 2014, concluding that Ms. Rodriguez established that she had a reasonable \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  fear of persecution in Mexico.  (Id. Ex. 4-G, Form I-863.)  Ms. Rodriguez claims that defendants’ \n19  failure to provide her a reasonable fear determination within the prescribed 10-day period \n20  prolonged her detention and delayed her right to be heard on her claims for relief. \n21  II.  MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION \n22  A.  Legal Standard  \n23  Under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint may be \n24  dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th \n25  Cir. 2014).  The Court may consider affidavits and other evidence in order to be satisfied that \n26  jurisdiction exists.  Savage v. Glendale Union High Sch., 343 F.3d 1036, 1040 n.2 (9th Cir. 2003).  \n27  As the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that \n28  jurisdiction exists.  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 376-78 (1994).   \n7 \n\n \n1  B.  Jurisdiction under the APA and Mandamus Act \n2  Plaintiffs premise the Court’s jurisdiction on the Administrative Procedure Act and the \n3  mandamus statute, codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  Under the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, \n4  “[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to \n5  compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed \n6  to the plaintiff.”  Mandamus is available only when (1) the plaintiff’s claim is clear and certain; (2) \n7  the defendant official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt; and \n8  (3) no other adequate remedy is available.  Johnson v. Reilly, 349 F.3d 1149, 1154 (9th Cir. 2003); \n9  Lowry v. Barnhart, 329 F.3d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir. 2003).  Even if this test is met, a district court \n10  has discretion to deny relief.  Johnson, 349 F.3d at 1154. \n11  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) “authorizes suit by ‘[a] person suffering legal \n12  wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  meaning of a relevant statute.’ ”  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 61 (2004) \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  “[A] claim under § 706(1) can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.”  Id. at 64 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (emphasis in original).  Although the APA does not provide an independent basis for subject \nS d nr\nee 17  matter jurisdiction, see Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 107 (1977), the APA, in conjunction \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  with federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1331, may vest a federal court with \n19  jurisdiction to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.”  See, e.g., \n20  Elmalky v. Upchurch, No. 06-cv-2359, 2007 WL 944330, at *2 (N.D. Tex. March 28, 2007); Yu v. \n21  Brown, 36 F. Supp. 2d 922, 928–29 (D.N.M. 1999).  Thus, “district courts have jurisdiction to \n22  review agency action as part of their general federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331.”  \n23  Proyecto San Pablo v. I.N.S., 189 F.3d 1130, 1136 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1999). \n24  The jurisdictional dimensions of the APA and the Mandamus Act are considered to be \n25  coextensive for purposes of compelling agency action that has been unreasonably delayed.  \n26  Where, as here, the relief sought is identical under the APA and the mandamus statute, proceeding \n27  under one as opposed to the other is not significant.  See Dong v. Chertoff, 513 F. Supp. 2d 1158, \n28  1161-62 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (citing Independence Mining Co. v. Babbitt, 105 F.3d 502, 507 (9th \n8 \n\n \n1  Cir.1997); Hernadez–Avalos v. I.N.S., 50 F.3d 842, 845 (10th Cir. 1995) (citation omitted) (“ ‘[a] \n2  mandatory injunction [issued under the APA] . . . is essentially in the nature of mandamus’ ”)).  \n3  “Although the exact interplay between these two statutory schemes has not been thoroughly \n4  examined by the courts, the Supreme Court has construed a claim seeking mandamus under the \n5  MVA [Mandamus and Venue Act], ‘in essence,’ as one for relief under § 706 of the APA.” \n6  Independence Mining, 105 F.3d at 507 (citing Japan Whaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc'y, 478 \n7  U.S. 221, 230 n. 4 (1986)).3   \n8                                                   \n3 Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by statute.  (Mot. at 10.)  \n9 \nDefendants assert that the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. sections 1228(a)(1) and \n1231(h), precludes this case pursuant to the following provision:  “nothing in this section shall be \n10 \nconstrued to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any \n11  party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.”  8 U.S.C. §§ \n1228(a)(1); 1231(h).  The Court finds this argument unpersuasive.  Sections 1228 and 1231 relate \n12 \na  to the administrative removal and reinstatement proceedings.  By its terms, the preclusion \ntruo inro 13  provision in both of those sections relates to those sections specifically.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1228(a)(1) \nCfi (“Nothing in this section . . ..”); 8 U.S.C. §1231(h) (same).  The regulation at issue here, however, \n tclaC 14  implements CAT and was enacted to evaluate torture claims.  Although it exists and is \ni\nrts fo implemented within the context of processing such removals, Section 208.31 operates \niD tc 15  independently and for a unique purpose.  The preclusion provision in Sections 1228 and 1231 \n sir\net relate to claims seeking to enforce those particular provisions.  Section 208.31 simply does not fall \ntatsiD 16  within that scope.  \nS d nr Defendants argue for the first time in their reply brief that this Court cannot entertain the \nee 17 \ntinhtr instant case because the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1989 (“FARRA”), Pub. \nUo\nN 18  L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822, limits review of claims arising under CAT or \nits implementing regulations to those involving a final order of removal.  (Reply at 8.)  FARRA \n19  Section 2242(d) provides: \n \n20 \n(d) REVIEW AND CONSTRUCTION.—Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, and except as provided in the regulations \n21 \ndescribed in subsection (b), no court shall have jurisdiction to \n22  review the regulations adopted to implement this section, and \nnothing in this section shall be construed as providing any court \n23  jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the \nConvention or this section, or any other determination made with \n24 \nrespect to the application of the policy set forth in subsection (a), \nexcept as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to \n25 \nsection 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § \n26  1252). \n \n27  FARRA § 2242(d).  Defendants argue that the FARRA provides that a court may review claims \nunder the Convention Against Torture only as part of review of a final order of removal and that \n28 \ntherefore this case must be dismissed.  (Reply at 8 (citing Hamoui v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 821, 826 \n9 \n\n \n1  C.  Discussion \n2  In Norton, 542 U.S. 55, the Supreme Court held that “the only agency action that can be \n3  compelled under the APA is action legally required.”  Id. at 63.  It follows that an agency’s delay \n4  in acting “cannot be unreasonable with respect to action that is not required.”  Id. n.1.   \n5  In order to establish jurisdiction, plaintiffs must establish that defendants had a clear, \n6  nondiscretionary duty to conduct reasonable fear determinations within the timeframe set forth in \n7  Section 208.31.  Defendants contend that Section 208.31 does not create such a duty.  (Mot. at 7-\n8  11.)  The gravamen of defendants’ 12(b)(1) motion is that the time period set forth in Section \n9  208.31 is subject to the agency’s discretion, and that therefore compliance with Section 208.31 \n10  falls outside the scope of the APA.  Put differently, it is defendants’ argument that because Section \n11  208.31 does not require the agency to conduct the reasonable fear determinations within the 10-\n12  day timeframe, petitioner cannot ask this Court to compel it to do so. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Defendants offer various arguments in support of this position:  (i) that Section 208.31 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  does not provide a legally cognizable, actionable right for plaintiffs or members of the class; (ii) \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the implementation of Section 208.31 is committed to agency discretion by law; and (iii) that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Section 208.31 does not impose any mandatory deadline for agency action.  Separately, defendants \nS d nr\nee 17  argue that because each of the named plaintiffs has received reasonable fear determinations, their \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  individual claims are moot and must be dismissed.  (Mot. at 6-7.)   \n19  The Court disagrees as to both of defendants’ arguments and finds that it properly has \n20  jurisdiction over this case.  The following discussion addresses first the question of whether a \n21  violation of Section 208.31(b) falls within this Court’s jurisdiction, and second, the question of \n22 \n                                                                                                                                                                \n23  (9th Cir. 2004) (citing FARRA, § 2242(d)).)  Aside from the improper assertion of a new theory \nfor the first time in a reply brief, this argument is unavailing.  Plaintiffs do not seek to enforce the \n24 \nUnited States’ obligations under the CAT generally.  The question presented to the Court is \nnarrower:  whether the regulation promulgated by the agency as a means of implementing CAT \n25 \ncreates legally actionable rights for individuals such as plaintiffs.  The import of this distinction is \n26  made all the more apparent by the fact that Section 2242’s jurisdiction limiting provision contains \nan exception that contemplates that regulations promulgated by the agencies may “provide” \n27  jurisdiction for judicial review.  See FARRA § 2242(b) and (d).  Thus, FARRA does not bar the \nCourt’s jurisdiction in this case. \n28 \n \n10 \n\n \n1  whether plaintiffs here qualify for an exception to the mootness doctrine.  \n2  i.  The Meaning of Section 208.31 \n3  The central questions in this case are ones no other court has yet had occasion to consider:  \n4  Does Section 208.31(b) require agency action within a specified timeframe?  Does Section \n5  208.31(b) confer a benefit on individuals who await reasonable fear determinations such that the \n6  agency is obligated to comply with its own regulation?  For the reasons set forth below, the Court \n7  finds that Section 208.31(b) does require the agency to complete reasonable fear determinations \n8  within 10 days as a general matter, and that the agency is not free to undertake reasonable fear \n9  determinations without regard to the timeframe specified in the regulation.   \n10  The interpretation of Section 208.31 properly begins with the plain language.   \n11   \n(b) Initiation of reasonable fear determination process.  Upon \n12 \na  issuance of a Final Administrative Removal Order under §238.1 of \ntruo inro 13  this chapter, or notice under §241.8(b) of this chapter that an alien is \nCfi subject to removal, an alien described in paragraph (a) of this \n tla\ncC 14  section shall be referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear \ni\nrts fo determination.  In the absence of exceptional circumstances, this \niD tc 15  determination will be conducted within 10 days of the referral. \n sir\netattsiD 16   \nS d nr 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(emphasis supplied).  A straightforward reading of Section 208.31 demonstrates \nee 17 \nth\nintr that the agency is required to take an action:  “upon issuance” of an administrative order of \nUo\nN 18 \nremoval or reinstatement of removal, the agency “will [] conduct[]” a reasonable fear \n19 \ndetermination.  Id.  Section 208.31 then sets forth a timeline for that action:  the determination \n20 \n“will” occur within “10 days of the referral” “[i]n the absence of exceptional circumstances.”  Id.  \n21 \nThere is nothing in Section 208.31 to suggest that that the agency has discretion to avoid making \n22 \nthe determinations, nor is there any support for the notion that the agency has unlimited discretion \n23 \nto delay these determinations.  Quite to the contrary, the regulation evinces a strong preference \n24 \nthat the agency conduct these proceedings expeditiously – only “exceptional circumstances” can \n25 \njustify delays longer than 10 days.  Thus, the regulation requires that generally, the agency will \n26 \nconduct reasonable fear determinations within the 10 day timeframe.   \n27 \nThat Section 208.31 imposes a non-discretionary duty on the USCIS to conduct these \n28 \n11 \n\n \n1  determinations within 10 days in the ordinary course makes sense given the policy purpose of the \n2  regulatory scheme.  The United States has agreed not to “expel, return, (“refouler”) or extradite a \n3  person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in \n4  danger of being subjected to torture.”  See Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n5  § 2242, Pub. L. 105-227, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-821; see also Regulations Concerning the \n6  Convention Against Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8,478-01.  Accordingly, an individual may seek \n7  withholding of removal if his or her “life or freedom would be threatened in that country because \n8  of [his/her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political \n9  opinion.”  8 U.S.C. section 1231(b)(3)(A).  “Withholding of removal is mandatory under the \n10  [CAT] implementing regulations” if an individual is found to have a reasonable fear of return.  \n11  Nuru, 404 F.3d at 1216.   \n12  The regulatory scheme of which Section 208.31 is a part was intended to balance the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  United States’ obligations under the CAT, while also accommodating the nation’s interest in \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  having effective immigration laws.  To that end, the regulations were designed to provide “fair and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  efficient procedures” to ensure compliance with the CAT obligations “within the overall \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  regulatory framework for the issuance of removal orders and decisions about the execution of such \nS d nr\nee 17  order.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 8,479.  The Federal Register reflects that the INS had “designed a system \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  that will allow aliens subject to the various types of removal proceedings currently afforded by the \n19  immigration laws to seek, and where eligible, to be accorded protection under Article 3.  At the \n20  same time, [the INS] created mechanisms to identify quickly and resolve frivolous claims to \n21  protection so that the new procedures cannot be used as a delaying tactic by aliens who are not in \n22  fact at risk.”  Id.   \n23  In light of both the purpose and language of Section 208.31, it is apparent that the \n24  regulation at issue here confers benefits on both the individuals and the agency.  The regulations \n25  created a process to guarantee that the United States would not return individuals to their countries \n26  of origin where doing so could result in torture or persecution.  Given the context in which the \n27  regulations were promulgated, it is apparent that the right of individuals not to be subjected to \n28  such treatment was of paramount importance.  As part of that regulatory scheme, Section \n12 \n\n \n1  208.31(b) provides a mechanism and process to ensure that individuals who reasonably fear \n2  torture and persecution can be protected.  Moreover, one objective of the regulations was to \n3  provide such individuals “fair” process and timely opportunity to be heard.  64 Fed. Reg. at 8,479.   \n4  Finally, while they await hearings on their reasonable fear claims, individuals are held in \n5  detention; functionally, the regulation ensures that such detention is limited unless exceptional \n6  circumstances warrant a delay.   \n7  Section 208.31, read in a straightforward manner, properly recognizes the vital liberty \n8  interest at play in these reasonable fear determinations.  It thus limits the deprivation of that liberty \n9  interest both for the individuals who do possess a reasonable fear of return and for whom \n10  withholding of removal is mandatory, see Nuru, 404 F.3d at 1216, and for the individuals who do \n11  not and are therefore subject to removal.  At the same time, the regulation ensures that the agency \n12  expeditiously resolves reasonable fear claims, which as a practical matter conserves resources, and \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  ensures that the agency is able to continue to remove individuals who are not found to have \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  reasonable fears of return.  See 64 Fed. Reg. at 8,479.  Thus, Section 208.31 balances various \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  competing interests: the liberty interest of the individuals, and the interest of the agency in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  efficiently managing its processing of removals.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants assert four arguments to contest jurisdiction.  The first is procedural.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Defendants’ position that the regulation is merely “hortatory,” a “procedural rule,” or an “internal \n19  administrative processing guideline” and does not confer any right on the individual detained or \n20  create any mandatory duty for the agency fails.  (Mot. at 8-11.)  As set forth above, Section 208.31 \n21  is not merely a procedural rule assisting the orderly transaction of business.  Cf. Am. Farm Lines v. \n22  Black Ball Freight Servs., 397 U.S. 532, 539 (1970) (finding that an administrative agency has \n23  discretion to relax or modify its procedural rules adopted for the orderly transaction of business \n24  before it); Health Sys. Agency of Oklahoma v. Norman, 589 F.2d 486, 489-90 (10th Cir. 1978) \n25  (finding that agencies may waive compliance with their own procedural rules in certain instances, \n26  for example, where the purpose of the rule is for “the orderly transaction of business before it”).  \n27  Rather, Section 208.31 impacts the liberty right of individuals and sets in place limitations on the \n28  agency’s deprivation of that right.  Where, as here, “the rights of individuals are affected, it is \n13 \n\n \n1  incumbent upon agencies to follow their own procedures.  This is so even where the internal \n2  procedures are possibly more rigorous than otherwise would be required.”  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 \n3  U.S. 199, 235 (1974).  The Court therefore finds that the agency cannot unilaterally disregard the \n4  requirements in Section 208.31, as plaintiffs allege has happened here. \n5  Second, defendants further argue that Section 208.31 does not create an enforceable \n6  obligation on the agency because neither the regulation nor the statute provides a penalty in the \n7  event that the Agency does not provide the reasonable fear determination within 10 days.  (Mot. at \n8  8-10 (citing various cases involving government deadlines, including Barnhart v. Peabody Coal \n9  Co., 537 U.S. 149, 158 (2003) (determining that act was valid even though it was made after \n10  statutory deadline has passed); United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43, \n11  63 (1993) (declining to require dismissal of forefeiture action where agency failed to comply with \n12  regulatory timing requirements); Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.S. 253, 263 (1986) (holding the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  failure of an agency to take action by a statutory deadline does not divest the agency of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  jurisdiction to act after that deadline); United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 711-12 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (1990) (declining to require release of a respondent as sanction for the agency’s delay in holding a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  bail hearing)).)  Defendants thus contend that the agency does not lose its power to act in cases of \nS d nr\nee 17  noncompliance unless the statute specifies a sanction for missing the deadline.  (Mot. at 9.)  This \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  argument, however, fails to appreciate the nature of the relief requested in this case.  Plaintiffs do \n19  not pray that defendants be precluded from conducting reasonable fear determinations after the 10 \n20  day period elapses, nor are plaintiffs requesting that the Court fashion a sanction in response to the \n21  agency’s alleged noncompliance with Section 208.31.  Plaintiffs merely ask the Court to require \n22  the agency to comply with its rule.   \n23  Defendants next argue that because the agency cannot create a binding regulation where a \n24  statute does not impose a corresponding duty, the Court cannot enforce the same.  (Mot. at 10.)  \n25  This argument is unpersuasive.  Procedures in a regulation, or a requirement to act in a regulation, \n26  can be enforceable even where the statute preceding the regulation does not create a similar duty.  \n27  See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 267 (1954) (finding procedures \n28  set forth in a regulation binding as a limit on the Attorney General’s authority because “as long as \n14 \n\n \n1  the regulations remain operative, the Attorney General denies himself the right to sidestep the \n2  Board or dictate its decision in any manner.”); Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 388 (1957) \n3  (“While it is of course true that . . . the Secretary was not obligated to impose upon himself these \n4  more rigorous substantive and procedural standards, neither was he prohibited from doing so . . . \n5  and having done so he could not, so long as the Regulations remained unchanged, proceed without \n6  regard to them.”); Dong, 513 F. Supp. 2d at 1166 (finding a regulation created a duty to act \n7  pursuant to a particular timeframe even though statute did not create a deadline).  Where, as here, \n8  a regulation creates a duty to act within a particular timeframe, the agency does not have the \n9  freedom to abdicate its responsibility.  \n10    Finally, defendants argue that because the contours of “exceptional circumstances” is \n11  undefined in the regulation, the timing of reasonable fear determinations is “committed to agency \n12  discretion by law.”  (Mot. at 11-12.)  The Court disagrees.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Under APA section 701(a), judicial review of agency action is foreclosed where the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 828, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  830 (1985).  As the Supreme Court has stated, “this is a very narrow exception . . . The legislative \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  history of the Administrative Procedure Act indicates that it is applicable in those rare instances \nS d nr\nee 17  where ‘statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.’ S.Rep. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1945).”  Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830 (citing Citizens to Preserve \n19  Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971)).  The exception applies where a “statute is \n20  drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \n21  exercise of discretion.  In such a case, the statute (“law”) can be taken to have “committed” the \n22  decision-making to the agency’s judgment absolutely.”  Id.  In determining whether judicial \n23  review is precluded on Section 701(a)(2) grounds, courts consider “the language of the statute and \n24  whether the general purposes of the statute would be endangered by judicial review.”  Pinnacle \n25  Armor, Inc. v. United States, 648 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cnty. of Esmeralda v. \n26  Dep’t of Energy, 925 F.2d 1216, 1218 (9th Cir. 1991) (citing Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 599–\n27  601 (1988).)).  A court may also look to “regulations, established agency policies, or judicial \n28  decisions” for a meaningful standard to review.  Mendez–Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 865, 868 \n15 \n\n \n1  (9th Cir. 2003).  “[T]he mere fact that a statute contains discretionary language does not make \n2  agency action unreviewable.”  Pinnacle Armor, Inc., 648 F.3d at 719 (quoting Beno v. Shalala, 30 \n3  F.3d 1057, 1066 (9th Cir. 1994)).   \n4    The Court finds that Section 208.31 does not present one of “those rare instances where \n5  statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.”  See Webster, \n6  486 U.S. at 599 (quoting Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 410).  Defendants argue strenuously that \n7  because the term “exceptional” is not defined expressly elsewhere in the regulation or statute, the \n8  agency retains essentially unfettered discretion as to what justifies a departure from the 10 day \n9  timeframe.  This argument ignores the plain meaning of “exceptional,” which provides some \n10  limiting principle to the bounds of agency discretion and a meaningful guide for judicial review.   \n11  The plain meaning of the term “exceptional” establishes that the reasons for the agency’s \n  12  delay of longer than 10 days must be “rare” or “deviating from the norm.”  MERRIAM-WEBSTER’S \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  NINTH NEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 432 (9th ed. 1988).  Although what may constitute \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “exceptional circumstances” in the context of the agency’s operations admits of some discretion, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  there is an obvious limit to that discretion.  The contours of the term “exceptional circumstances” \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  are made more clear when one considers circumstances that would not qualify as exceptional.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Ordinary, insignificant, normal circumstances cannot, by definition, qualify.  To hold otherwise \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  would allow the exception to swallow the rule.  See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(ii) (“[T]he term \n19  “exceptional circumstances” does not include a delay that results from a predictable agency \n20  workload . . ..”); Gov’t Accountability Project v. HHS, 568 F. Supp. 2d 55, 60-61 (D.D.C. 2008) \n21  (holding that “allowing a mere showing of a normal backlog of request to constitute ‘exceptional \n22  circumstances’ would render the concept and its underlying Congressional intent meaningless”; \n23  finding that where requests had increased for the last four years, “by this point, [the requests] \n24  appear to be more of a predictable agency workload than a deluge of unanticipated \n25  responsibility.”); Leadership Conference on Civil Rights v. Gonzales, 404 F. Supp. 2d 246, 259 \n26  n.4 (D.D.C. 2005) (“An agency must show more than a great number of requests to establish [. . .] \n27  exceptional circumstances under the FOIA.”); Donham v. DOE, 192 F. Supp. 2d 877, 882 (S.D. \n28  Ill. 2002) (refusing to accept agency’s argument that its backlog qualifies as “exceptional \n16 \n\n \n1  circumstances” because “then the ‘exceptional circumstances’ provision would render \n2  meaningless the [deadline].”)  Notably, defendants have offered no persuasive argument that a \n3  court would be ill-advised to adjudge the agency’s determination of circumstances that qualify as \n4  “exceptional.”  Defendants do not assert that “exceptional circumstances” is a term of art, or that \n5  the interpretation of the term necessarily requires any experience or understanding unique to the \n6  agency.  (See Mot. at 11-13.)  Nor have defendants argued that the agency action at issue in this \n7  case is so specialized or complex that a court could not adjudicate whether the agency’s delay was \n8  due to reasons of an “exceptional” nature.  (See id.)  These deficiencies counsel against finding \n9  that the limited discretion afforded the agency in Section 208.31 insulates its actions from judicial \n10  review entirely.4   \n11  To be sure, what qualifies as “exceptional” in this context carries with it broad discretion, \n12  and deference to the agency is therefore required in the ordinary course.  As the Supreme Court \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  noted in Norton, a principle purpose of the APA is to protect agencies against “undue judicial \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  interference with their lawful discretion, and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  disagreements which courts lack both expertise and information to resolve.”  Norton, 542 U.S. at \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  66.  This case, however, presents the rare instance where an agency is alleged to have failed \nS d nr\nee 17  entirely, for a length of several years, to comply with a timeframe set forth in a regulation in the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n                                                 \n19  4 Defendants cite Martinez–Rosas v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir. 2005) to suggest that \nthe Ninth Circuit has held the phrase “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” is so broad \n20 \nthat judicial review is barred under APA Section 701(a)(2).  (Mot. at 12.)  The basis for the Ninth \nCircuit’s holding in that case, however, was not that the phrase there at issue was wanting for a \n21 \nmeaningful legal standard on judicial review.  Rather, the Ninth Circuit found that it did not have \n22  jurisdiction over the agency’s discretionary judgment due to the enactment of 8 U.S.C. section \n1252(a)(2)(B)(i), which barred judicial review of certain discretionary agency decisions.  See \n23 \nMartinez-Rosas, 424 F.3d at 929-930 (noting that Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) states that \n“notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review (i) any \n24 \njudgment regarding the granting of relief under section . . . 1229b [cancellation of removal].”) ; \n25  Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, 327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir. 2003) (concluding that the “exceptional \nand extremely unusual hardship” determination is discretionary and thus “carved out of our \n26  appellate jurisdiction” pursuant to Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)).  The Ninth Circuit did not determine \nconclusively that the phrase “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” was so broad as to \n27 \nsatisfy the separate, narrower standard under APA Section 701(a)(2), and defendants do not claim \nthat Section 1252(a)(2)(B) applies in this case.  \n28 \n \n17 \n\n \n1  great majority of all reasonable fear determinations, and where there is no end to such \n2  noncompliance in sight.  The agency is alleged to have “foregone any attempt to comply” with \n3  Section 208.31, and to have instead implemented different, more relaxed “goals” for the \n4  completion of reasonable fear interviews.  (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 26.)   \n5  The exhibits provided by defendants in support of their motion reinforce these allegations.5  \n6  (See Dkt. No. 58-1 (“Mercado-Santana Decl.”); Dkt. No. 43-7 (“Mura Decl.); Dkt. No. 43-8 \n7  (“Lafferty Decl.”).)  These declarations illustrate that the exceptional appears to have become the \n8  norm such that nothing about the agency’s delay is due to anything of a “rare” or “unusual” nature.  \n9  Rather, the fact of noncompliance in the majority of reasonable fear determinations appears to be \n10  part of an ongoing and expected trend.  For example, of the 2,583 reasonable fear determinations \n11  rendered in the first half of 2014, only 78 were completed without a delay.  (Dkt. No. 43-7 at 7.)  \n12  In contrast, 1,824 were delayed for “lack of resources,” and 498 were delayed for no stated reason.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  (Id.)  Likewise, in 2013, 2,711 reasonable fear determinations were delayed for lack of resources, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and 856 were delayed for no stated reason.  (Id.)  In 2012, of the 2,036 total determinations, 1,124 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  were delayed for lack of resources, and 732 were delayed for no stated reason.  (Id.)  Records from \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  between 2006 to 2014 show marked increases in the number of reasonable fear determinations and \nS d nr\nee 17  document that the agency was well aware of this ever-increasing trend.  (Id.)  Thus, although the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  agency maintains that the increases were unpredictable, uncontrollable, and unanticipated (see \n19  Lafferty Decl. at ¶¶ 8-10), the evidence provided suggests that for the last eight years, the agency \n20  was faced with an obvious and persistent trend.  Although a dramatic increase in caseload could be \n21  fairly considered an “exceptional” circumstance for a time, here the steady increase in referrals for \n22  the last eight years demonstrates that the current caseload appears to be more of a “predictable \n23  agency workload than a deluge of unanticipated responsibility.”  See Gov’t Accountability Project, \n24  568 F. Supp. 2d at 60-61. \n25  The agency maintains that compliance with the timeframe put forth in Section 208.31 is \n26 \n                                                 \n27  5 The evidence proffered may be appropriately considered in the context of resolving \ndefendants’ 12(b)(1) motion.  Savage v. Glendale Union High Sch., 343 F.3d 1036, 1040 n.2 (9th \n28 \nCir. 2003). \n18 \n\n \n1  impracticable.  “[M]ultiple constraints” impede compliance, “many of which are beyond the \n2  control of the agency and were not anticipated, and thus not accounted for, at the time the \n3  applicable regulations were drafted,” and the “availability of staff” has not been sufficiently \n4  adjusted to meet the requirements of Section 208.31 given the “exponentially” increasing \n5  caseload.  (Lafferty Decl. ¶¶ 8,9.)  In 2011, faced with the rising tide of reasonable fear referrals, \n6  the agency undertook to “recommend” new “reasonable fear performance goals.” (Dkt. No. 58-1 \n7  Ex. A (“Langlois Memo”).)  Rather than seek to implement a strategy to achieve compliance with \n8  Section 208.31’s 10-day requirement, the agency appears to have ignored the regulatory deadline \n9  altogether.  It expanded the timeframe for completion of reasonable fear determinations to 90 days \n10  for 85% of cases, with 95% of the determinations to be completed within at least 150 days.  (Id. at \n11  1.)  According to the Langlois Memo, only the “exceptional case” would fall outside the 150 day \n12  limit.  (See id.)  In arriving at these new timeframes, the agency identified and considered practical \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  and logistical barriers to timely completing reasonable fear determinations.6  (Id. at 2.)  Regardless \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  of the stated reasons for adjusting its deadlines, however, having promulgated a binding regulation \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  governing the timeliness for processing reasonable fear referrals, the agency was not free to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  disregard that regulation.7  See Service, 354 U.S. at 388  (“While it is of course true that . . . the \nS d nr\nee 17  Secretary was not obligated to impose upon himself these more rigorous substantive and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  procedural standards, neither was he prohibited from doing so . . . and having done so he could \n19  not, so long as the Regulations remained unchanged, proceed without regard to them.”).   \n20  Although whether exceptional circumstances exist is a determination largely left to agency \n21  discretion in the first instance, here plaintiffs allege – and evidence of record suggests – that far \n22  from exercising that discretion, defendants have abdicated their obligation to comply with the \n23                                                   \n6 Notably, the 10 day requirement in the agency’s own regulations does not appear to have \n24 \nfigured as a factor considered in developing the new timeframes.  (See generally, Langlois \nMemo.)  \n25 \n \n26  7 Indeed, although it has played no part in the instant analysis, the Court notes that at \nargument, counsel for plaintiffs argued that despite the agency’s protestations that it is unable to \n27  complete these determinations in a timely manner, the government is able to complete credible \nfear determinations, a process bearing marked similarity to the reasonable fear determination \n28 \nprocess, in approximately two weeks.  (Dkt. No. 67 (“Tr.”) at 15-18.)  \n19 \n\n \n1  regulatory timeframe in the vast majority of cases.  Under the APA, a court shall “compel agency \n2  action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  “[T]he mere fact that a \n3  statute contains discretionary language does not make agency action unreviewable.”  Pinnacle \n4  Armor, Inc., 648 F.3d at 719 (quoting Beno, 30 F.3d at 1066).  Where a party alleges that the \n5  agency has failed to act consistently with a regulation, the Court has jurisdiction to hear the party’s \n6  claim and to compel action pursuant to the APA and federal question jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Dong \n7  v. Chertoff, 513 F. Supp. 2d 1158, 1167 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (finding that violation of a non-\n8  discretionary duty to act pursuant to regulation conferred subject matter jurisdiction under the \n9  APA in conjunction with federal question jurisdiction); Elmalky, 2007 WL 944330, at *4 (same).  \n10  As a practical matter, it may well be that resolving these reasonable fear determinations within 10 \n11  days is exceedingly difficult, indeed, even disadvantageous for the person seeking a favorable \n12  reasonable fear determination.  Nonetheless, given the express command in Section 208.31, \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  neither the Court nor the agency is free to disregard it.  Where, as here, an agency is alleged to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  have foregone any attempt entirely to comply with a binding regulation, its non-compliance is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  properly subject to review in the federal courts.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ii.  Mootness \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants contend that because all named plaintiffs have received their reasonable fear \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  determinations (albeit, not within 10 days of referral), their individual claims are moot.  (Dkt. No. \n19  43 at 9.)  The Court finds an exception to the mootness doctrine appropriate in this case.  \n20  Plaintiffs’ claims, as well as those of their class members, are inherently transitory, and capable of \n21  repetition yet evading review.  To impose the mootness doctrine would thus enable defendants to \n22  avoid review of the claims presented here.  Accordingly, as class representatives, plaintiffs qualify \n23  for an exception to the mootness doctrine, even if they have received reasonable fear \n24  determinations, and even if there is no indication that they may again be subject to the acts that \n25  gave rise to their claims.  See Wade v. Kirkland, 118 F.3d 667, 670 (9th Cir. 1997).   \n26  Moreover, the Supreme Court has recognized that “[s]ome claims are so inherently \n27  transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class \n28  certification before the proposed representative’s individual interest expires.”  Cnty. of Riverside v. \n20 \n\n \n1  McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 51-52 (1991) (citing U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, \n2  399 (1980) (citations omitted)).  In such cases, the “relation back” doctrine is properly invoked to \n3  preserve the merits of the case for judicial resolution.  See id. (citing Swisher v. Brady, 438 U.S. \n4  204, 213–214 n. 11 (1978); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402 n. 11 (1975)).   \n5  Accordingly, plaintiffs may represent the class and pursue this action despite having had \n6  reasonable fear determinations.8   \n7  For these reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is DENIED. \n8  III.  MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM \n9  A.  Legal Standard \n10  A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in \n11  the complaint.  Ileto v. Glock, Inc., 349 F.3d 1191, 1199-1200 (9th Cir. 2003).  “Dismissal can be \n12  based on the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  cognizable legal theory.”  Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  All allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  plaintiff.  Johnson v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 653 F.3d 1000, 1010 (9th Cir. 2011).  To survive a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a \nS d nr\nee 17  claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). \n19  B.  Discussion \n20  Under section 706(1) of the APA, a court may “compel agency action unlawfully withheld \n21  or unreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1).  The APA further provides that agencies must \n22  conclude matters before them “within a reasonable time.”  5 U.S.C. § 555(b).  In Norton, 542 U.S. \n23  at 64, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff states a claim for relief under section 706(1) when he \n24  “asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.”  “[W]hen \n25  an agency is compelled by law to act within a certain time period, but the manner of its action is \n26  left to the agency's discretion, a court can compel the agency to act, but has no power to specify \n27 \n                                                 \n8 Defendants do not seriously contest plaintiffs’ status as class representatives as part of \n28 \ntheir motion for class certification.  \n21 \n\n \n1  what the action must be.”  Id. at 65.  \n2  To invoke the APA, plaintiffs must show that (1) the agency had a nondiscretionary duty \n3  to act, and (2) the agency unreasonably delayed in acting on that duty.  Gelfer v. Chertoff, No. 06-\n4  6724, 2007 WL 902382, at *1 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (citing Norton, 542 U.S. at 63-65; 5 U.S.C. §§ \n5  555(b), 701(a)(2)).  Defendants urge that in evaluating whether the delay at issue here is \n6  unreasonable, the Court should apply the six-factor test set forth in Telecomms. Research & Action \n7  Ctr. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 80 (D.C. Cir. 1984): \n \n8 \n(1) the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a \n“rule of reason”[;] (2) where Congress has provided a timetable or \n9 \nother indication of the speed with which it expects the agency to \n10  proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory scheme may supply \ncontent for this rule of reason [;] (3) delays that might be reasonable \n11  in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human \nhealth and welfare are at stake [;] (4) the court should consider the \n12 \na  effect of expediting delayed action on agency activities of a higher \ntr in\nuoro 13  or competing priority[;] (5) the court should also take into account \nCfi the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by the delay[;] and \n tla\ncC 14  (6) the court need not “find any impropriety lurking behind agency \ni\nrts fo lassitude in order to hold that agency action is unreasonably \niD tc 15  delayed.” \n sir\netattsiD 16   \nS d nr Independence Mining Co. v. Babbitt, 105 F.3d 502, 507 (9th Cir. 1997) (citing TRAC, 750 F.2d at \nee 17 \nth\nintr 80 (citations omitted)).  As an initial matter, the Court notes that none of the cases cited by \nUo\nN 18 \ndefendants in support of their argument apply the TRAC factors in circumstances analogous to the \n19 \ninstant case – where an agency regulation confers a right to resolution generally in a defined \n20 \ntimeframe, and where the agency has essentially abdicated any effort to comply with that \n21 \nregulatory deadline.  Indeed, Ninth Circuit authority suggests that where a firm deadline exists, the \n22 \nCourt need not undertake TRAC’s six-factor balancing inquiry.  Biodiversity Legal Found. v. \n23 \nBadgley, 309 F.3d 1166, 1177 n.11 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Brower v. Evans, 257 F.3d 1058, \n24 \n1068-69 (9th Cir. 2001) (affirming district court’s application of TRAC factors at summary \n25 \njudgment where there was no statutory or regulatory deadline or timeframe).   \n26 \nRegardless, if the TRAC factors are to apply, the Court cannot resolve at this juncture \n27 \nwhether plaintiffs have met this fact-intensive test.  (See Mot. at 13-17; Reply at 12-14.)  See \n28 \n22 \n\n \n1  Independence Mining Co., 105 F.3d 502 (evaluating district court’s application of TRAC factors \n2  on cross-motions for summary judgment); Gelfer, 2007 WL 902382, at *2 (denying motion to \n3  dismiss in context where no statutory or regulatory deadline was present and noting that “[w]hat \n4  constitutes an unreasonable delay in the context of immigration applications depends to a great \n5  extent on the facts of the particular case”) (quoting Yu, 36 F. Supp. 2d at 932); cf. Chen v. \n6  Chertoff, No. 07-2816, 2008 WL 205279, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2008) (resolving summary \n7  judgment in favor of plaintiff and finding the government’s delay unreasonable).9  Indeed, \n8  defendants concede that the analysis of an unreasonable delay claim under the TRAC factors is a \n9  “complicated and nuanced task” because the Court needs to consider the particular facts and \n10  circumstances of the delay.  (Mot. at 13 (citing Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Council, Inc. v. \n11  Norton, 336 F.3d 1094, 1100 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (concerning a district court’s summary judgment \n12  application of the TRAC factors).)   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  The Court finds that plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to state a plausible claim for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  relief under the APA.  Contrary to defendants’ argument that plaintiffs have failed to allege that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Section 208.31(b) was violated because they have not specifically alleged that no “exceptional \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  circumstances” exist to justify the current level of delays (see Reply at 12), the Court finds that \nS d nr\nee 17  plaintiffs’ complaint, fairly construed, alleges precisely that – and more.  The gravamen of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  plaintiffs’ complaint is that the agency has abdicated its responsibility to comply with Section \n19  208.31 entirely.  This necessarily includes a failure to comply with the exception to the general 10-\n20  day deadline.  Taking full view of plaintiffs’ theory and construing all facts alleged in plaintiffs’ \n21  favor, as is required in the context of a 12(b)(6) motion, the Court finds that plaintiffs have alleged \n22 \n                                                 \n23  9 Defendants appear to insist that the evidence submitted in support of their 12(b)(1) \njurisdictional arguments can and should be considered in the context of their 12(b)(6) motion.  \n24 \n(See Mot. at 14-17 (relying heavily on evidence outside the complaint in support of argument that \nplaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits applying the TRAC factors).)  Reliance on such evidence in \n25 \nthe context of the instant motion is improper.  Defendants rely on this evidence to dispute the \n26  merits of plaintiffs’ claims, specifically, whether the agency delay in resolving reasonable fear \ndeterminations is reasonable.  This evidence has no place in the context of defendants’ 12(b)(6) \n27  motion; it may properly be considered only on a motion for summary judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(d).  Accordingly, the evidence cited has played no part in the Court’s consideration of \n28 \ndefendants’ 12(b)(6) motion. \n23 \n\n \n1  facts sufficient to state a claim under the APA and in light of the TRAC factors.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 7, \n2  29 (alleging that “rarely if ever” does the agency timely resolve reasonable fear claims); ¶¶ 24-30 \n3  (describing the functional role of reasonable fear determinations in the statutory and regulatory \n4  scheme and the effects of delays at the reasonable fear determination stage; alleging that the \n5  agency “has foregone any attempt to comply with the timeframe” and has instead implemented \n6  different “goals” for the completion of reasonable fear interviews that ignore the requirement in \n7  Section 208.31(b).)   \n8  For all these reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is DENIED.  \n9  IV.  MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n10  Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class of all individuals who: \n \n11 \n(1) are or will be subject to removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § \n1231(a)(5) or 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b);  \n12 \na   \ntr in (2) who have expressed, or in the future express, a fear of returning \nuoro 13  to their country of removal; and \nCfi\n tla  \ncC 14 \ni (3) who have not received, or do not receive, a reasonable fear \nrts fo determination pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 208.31 within ten days of \niD tc 15  referral to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The  defined  class does not include individuals who have received their reasonable fear \nS d nr\nee 17  determinations.  (Dkt. No. 40 (“Reply”) at 4.)  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  A.  Legal Standard \n19  A party seeking class certification must satisfy the four prerequisites of Rule 23(a): “(1) \n20  numerosity of plaintiffs; (2) common questions of law or fact predominate; (3) the named \n21  plaintiff’s claims and defenses are typical; and (4) the named plaintiff can adequately protect the \n22  interests of the class.”  Arnott, et al. v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579, \n23  583 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (citing Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)) \n24  (internal quotation marks omitted).  In addition to meeting the requirements set forth in Rule \n25  23(a), the proposed class must also qualify under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3).  Zinser v. Accufix \n26  Research Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001).  Here, Petitioners ask the Court to \n27  certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  (Compl. ¶¶ 60-70; Mot. at 12-13.)  Rule 23(b)(2) permits class \n28  actions for declaratory or injunctive relief where “the party opposing the class has acted or refused \n24 \n\n \n1  to act on grounds that generally apply to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n2  The party seeking class certification bears the burden of proof in demonstrating that it has \n3  satisfied all four Rule 23(a) prerequisites and that their class lawsuit falls within one of the three \n4  types of actions permitted under Rule 23(b).  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186.  The failure to meet “any \n5  one of Rule 23’s requirements destroys the alleged class action.”  Rutledge v. Elec. Hose & \n6  Rubber Co., 511 F.2d 668, 673 (9th Cir. 1975).  The Supreme Court has held that “actual, not \n7  presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a) [is] indispensable.”  Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. \n8  147, 160 (1982).  Consequently, a district court must conduct a rigorous analysis to determine \n9  whether plaintiffs met their burden to pursue their claims as a class action.  Id. at 161.  If a court is \n10  not fully satisfied, the class cannot be certified.  Id.  Even when all of Rule 23’s requirements are \n11  met, the district court retains “broad discretion” to determine whether a class should be certified. \n12  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186.  When reviewing a motion for class certification, a court should only \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  analyze the portions of the merits of a claim that overlap with Rule 23’s requirements.  See Eisen \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  B.  Discussion \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Defendants essentially concede that class certification in this case is proper.  With two \nS de nre 17  minor exceptions,10 they “do not otherwise contest class certification under Rule 23(a) or 23(b).” \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (Dkt. No. 38 (“Opp.”) at 9 n.4.)  Instead, defendants limit their opposition to the scope of the class \n19  that this Court should certify.  Nonetheless, as set forth below, the Court has undertaken the \n20  requisite “rigorous analysis” and finds the Rule 23(a) factors and the requirements of Rule 23(b) \n21  are both met.  The Court next explains why a nationwide class is appropriate in this case.  \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n10 Both of these arguments have been rendered either moot or immaterial.  Defendants first \nargue that plaintiff Bardalez is not a proper class representative, but plaintiffs have represented \n25 \nthat they will seek leave to voluntarily dismiss Bardalez’s claims.  (See Footnote 1, supra.)  Next, \n26  Defendants argue that the class as defined includes individuals who have already received \nreasonable fear determinations.  (Opp. at 9-12.)  The Court disagrees; the class definition as set \n27  forth by plaintiffs does not include individuals who have already received their reasonable fear \ndeterminations.  Nonetheless, for purposes of clarity, the Court expressly limits the class to only \n28 \nthose individuals who have not received these determinations.  (See also Reply at 5.)  \n25 \n\n \n1  1.  Rule 23(a)  \n2  First, publicly available data and materials provided in conjunction with the defendants’ \n3  motion to dismiss confirms that the proposed class members are so numerous that joinder of all is \n4  impracticable.  Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine Est., Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 913-14 (9th Cir. 1964); \n5  Asylum Division Quarterly Stakeholder Meeting, January 2014, Credible Fear and Reasonable \n6  Fear FY 2014 - Q1, http://1.usa.gov/1sDqaa3; see also Dkt. No. 43-7 (statistics on reasons for \n7  delay of reasonable fear determinations from 1999 to 2014).   \n8  Second, the class presents common questions of law and fact, namely, whether the agency \n9  has in fact abdicated any attempt to comply with the requirements of Section 208.31(b), and \n10  whether this violates the APA.  Here, the common question of law is fairly straightforward: Have \n11  Defendants violated the law by foregoing any attempt to comply with Section 208.31(b) and not \n12  providing class members reasonable fear determinations within ten days of referral to USCIS in \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the general course?  Thus, the putative class members’ claims “depend upon a common \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  contention” that is “of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011).  Thus, \nS d nr\nee 17  here the “capacity of a class wide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  resolution of the litigation.”  Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).    \n19  Third, the claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the proposed class. \n20  Like each and every one of the members of the proposed class, the plaintiffs have been subjected \n21  to prolonged detention upon “expressing a fear of return,” thus prompting the reasonable fear \n22  determination process.  See Pls.’ Mot. Ex. A, Decl. of Marco Antonio Alfaro Garcia, at ¶ 14; Ex. \n23  B, Decl. of Credy Madrid Calderon, at ¶ 10; Ex. C., Decl. of Gustavo Ortega at ¶ 8; Ex. D, Decl. \n24  of Claudia Rodriguez de la Torre, at ¶ 8; Ex. E, Decl. of Nancy Bardalez Serpa, at ¶ 6.  And, like \n25  the members of the proposed class, the agency should have timely provided plaintiffs with their \n26  reasonable fear determinations pursuant to the timeframe set forth in Section 208.31.  Thus, \n27  plaintiffs seek relief identical to that which the members of the proposed class would seek: the \n28  timely provision of a reasonable fear determination. \n26 \n\n \n1  Fourth, the Court finds that the class representatives’ interests coincide with those of the \n2  proposed class and that counsel for the class is adequate.  Plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU \n3  Foundation of Southern California, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern \n4  California, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and Reed Smith LLP (collectively, “Class \n5  Counsel”).  Class Counsel are experienced in protecting the interests of noncitizens and handling \n6  complex and class action litigation, including litigation on behalf of immigration detainees.  (Mot. \n7  Exs. F-I.)   \n8  2.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n9  Plaintiffs also must meet one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) for a class action to be \n10  certified.  That requirement is satisfied here, because the action meets the Rule 23(b)(2) \n11  requirement that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \n12  generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1195 (finding certification under \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Rule 23(b)(2) appropriate “where the primary relief sought is declaratory or injunctive”).  A class \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  may properly be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) if the opposing party’s “[a]ction or inaction is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  directed to a class . . . even if it has taken effect or is threatened only as to one or a few members \nS d nr\nee 17  of the class, provided it is based on grounds which have general application to the class.”  Fed. R. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Civ. P. 23(b)(2) Advisory Committee’s Note (1966).  It is sufficient that plaintiffs here allege a \n19  pattern of activity that is “central to the claims of all class members irrespective of their individual \n20  circumstances and the disparate effects of the conduct.”  Baby Neal for & by Kanter v. Casey, 43 \n21  F.3d 48, 57 (3d Cir. 1994).  Judicial economy also favors certification.  Indeed, even assuming \n22  that all of the putative class members could either be joined to this action or litigate each of their \n23  cases individually, doing so would constitute an inefficient use of judicial resources. \n24  Accordingly, all of the requirements of Rule 23 are met.  The Court therefore finds \n25  certification of plaintiffs’ proposed class appropriate so that all similarly situated individuals may \n26  benefit from the injunctive relief sought in this action. \n27  3.  Scope of the Class \n28  As stated above, defendants do not substantively dispute that class certification is \n27 \n\n \n1  appropriate under Rule 23(a) and (b).  Defendants’ sole substantive argument in opposition to \n2  plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is directed to the question of whether the Court should \n3  certify a nationwide or geographically confined class.   \n4  There is no per se prohibition against certification of a nationwide class, although the \n5  Supreme Court has cautioned that nationwide class actions “may have a detrimental effect by \n6  foreclosing adjudication by a number of different courts and judges.”  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 \n7  U.S. 682, 702 (1979) (affirming certification of a nationwide class).  Accordingly, “a federal court \n8  when asked to certify a nationwide class should take care to ensure that nationwide relief is indeed \n9  appropriate in the case before it, and that certification of such a class would not improperly \n10  interfere with the litigation of similar issues in other judicial districts.”  Id.  \n11  Mindful of this instruction, the Court finds that certification of a nationwide class is \n12  appropriate in this context.  This case addresses the government’s failure to abide by a mandatory \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  regulation designed to ensure the nation’s compliance with its obligations under international \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  agreements and statutory law.  The chief complaint is that defendants, who are charged with \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  enforcing and executing the nation’s immigration laws, are uniformly violating a federal \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  regulation promulgated to implement the United States’ obligations under an international \nS d nr\nee 17  agreement and statutory law.  In this unique context, national uniformity is of paramount \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  importance.   \n19  Although defendants argue that the Court should refrain from certifying a nationwide class, \n20  they present no compelling factual or legal argument as to why their legal obligations might vary \n21  state to state or region to region.  Cf. Arizona v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 2498 (2012) \n22  (recognizing that, when it comes to immigration matters, the government must act as “one national \n23  sovereign, not the 50 separate States.”)  Indeed, the practical consequences of not certifying a \n24  geographically limited class weigh in favor of nationwide certification.  An order requiring the \n25  government to comply with the regulatory deadline in some parts of the country, but not others, \n26  could lead to the government electing to comply merely by shifting its resources, leading to \n27  greater delays in parts of the country outside the scope of any ultimate ruling in this case.   \n28  Accordingly, courts have certified nationwide classes that challenge the government’s \n28 \n\n \n1  actions in enforcing the country’s immigration laws.  See, e.g., Santillan v. Ashcroft, No. C 04-\n2  2686 MHP, 2004 WL 2297990, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2004) (certifying nationwide class of \n3  lawful permanent residents challenging delays in receiving documentation of their status); Ali v. \n4  Ashcroft, 213 F.R.D. 390, 409-10 (W.D. Wash. 2003), aff’d, 346 F.3d 873, 886 (9th Cir. 2003), \n5  vacated on other grounds, 421 F.3d 795 (9th Cir. 2005) (certifying nationwide class of Somalis \n6  challenging legality of removal to Somalia in the absence of a functioning government); Perez-\n7  Funez v. District Director, I.N.S., 611 F. Supp. 990, 1005 (C.D. Cal. 1984) (certifying nationwide \n8  class of minors who are now or will be taken into custody by the INS for possible deportation).  \n9  Thus, a nationwide class is appropriate here.  Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is GRANTED. \n10  V.  CONCLUSION \n11  For the reasons stated above, defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and \n  12  12(b)(6) is DENIED.  Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is GRANTED.  The Court hereby \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  CERTIFIES a nationwide class of all individuals who: \nCfi\n tla  \ncC 14 \nirts fo (1) are or will be subject to removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § \niD tc 15  1231(a)(5) or 8 U.S.C. § 1228(b);  \n sir  \net\ntatsiD 16  (2) who have expressed, or in the future express, a fear of returning \nS d nr to their country of removal; and \nee 17   \nth\ninUtro (3) who have not received, or do not receive, a reasonable fear \nN 18 \ndetermination pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 208.31 within ten days of \nreferral to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. \n19 \nThe  defined class does not include individuals who have received their reasonable fear \n20 \ndeterminations.   \n21 \nThis Order terminates Docket Numbers 12 and 43. \n22 \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n23 \nDated:  November 21, 2014\n24 \n______________________________________ \n25 \n  YVONNE GONZALEZ ROGERS \n26    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n27 \n28 \n29 ",
