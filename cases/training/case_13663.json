Harley III, John Doe 10, Sanya Garcia, \"John\" Tanzin, William Gale, Francisco Artousa, Steven LNU, Michael LNU, Michael Rutkowski. Although federal law imposes limits on the investigative tactics federal officials may employ in seeking to keep this nation safe, it also establishes limits on the manner in which an individual may vindicate his rights should those tactics cross the line. For the reasons stated, the law does not permit Plaintiffs to seek damages against the Agents in their personal capacities either under Bivens or RFRA. Accordingly, the Agents' motion to dismiss is GRANTED and the claims against FNU Tanzin, Sanya Garcia, Francisco Artusa, John LNU, Michael Rutowski, William Gale, John C. Harley III, Steven LNU, Michael LNU, Gregg Grossochmig, Weysan Dun, James C. Langenberg, John Does 1-6 and 9-13 in their personal capacities are dismissed. The Court on its own motion also dismisses all personal capacity claims against John Does 7 and 8. See Hecht v. Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 26 n.6 (2d Cir. 1990). As previously noted, this opinion does not address the viability of Plaintiffs' official capacity claims and thus expresses no opinion on the merits of their arguments concerning the manner in which individuals are added to the No Fly List or the mechanisms for challenging such inclusion. The parties are directed to submit a joint letter to the Court within 30 days advising how they wish to proceed with respect to those claims. (As further set forth in this Order.)

PlaintiffsAppellants Muhammad Tanvir, Jameel Algibah, and Naveed Shinwari (\"Plaintiffs\") appeal from a February 17, 2016 final judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Abrams, J.), dismissing their complaint against senior federal law enforcement officials and 25 named and unnamed federal law enforcement officers. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that in retaliation for Plaintiffs' refusal to serve as informants, federal officers improperly placed or retained Plaintiffs' names on the \"No Fly List,\" in violation of Plaintiffs' rights under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. (\"RFRA\"). The complaint sought (1) injunctive and declaratory relief against all defendants in their official capacities for various constitutional and statutory violations, and (2) compensatory and punitive damages from federal law enforcement officers in their individual capacities for violations of their rights under the First Amendment and RFRA. After the parties agreed to stay the official capacity claims, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' individual capacity claims. As relevant here, the district court held that RFRA does not permit the recovery of money damages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities. Plaintiffs appeal that RFRA determination only. Because we disagree with the district court, and hold that RFRA permits a plaintiff to recover money damages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities for violations of RFRA's substantive protections, we reverse the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.

Harley III, John Doe 10, Sanya Garcia, \"John\" Tanzin, William Gale, Francisco Artousa, Steven LNU, Michael LNU, Michael Rutkowski. Although federal law imposes limits on the investigative tactics federal officials may employ in seeking to keep this nation safe, it also establishes limits on the manner in which an individual may vindicate his rights should those tactics cross the line. For the reasons stated, the law does not permit Plaintiffs to seek damages against the Agents in their personal capacities either under Bivens or RFRA. Accordingly, the Agents' motion to dismiss is GRANTED and the claims against FNU Tanzin, Sanya Garcia, Francisco Artusa, John LNU, Michael Rutowski, William Gale, John C. Harley III, Steven LNU, Michael LNU, Gregg Grossochmig, Weysan Dun, James C. Langenberg, John Does 1-6 and 9-13 in their personal capacities are dismissed. The Court on its own motion also dismisses all personal capacity claims against John Does 7 and 8. See Hecht v. Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 26 n.6 (2d Cir. 1990). As previously noted, this opinion does not address the viability of Plaintiffs' official capacity claims and thus expresses no opinion on the merits of their arguments concerning the manner in which individuals are added to the No Fly List or the mechanisms for challenging such inclusion. The parties are directed to submit a joint letter to the Court within 30 days advising how they wish to proceed with respect to those claims. (As further set forth in this Order.)

The Court currently takes no position regarding the viability of Plaintiffs' possible motion for attorneys' fees and costs. Because the parties agree that Plaintiffs' official capacity claims against Defendants may be dismissed without prejudice, the Court so dismisses them. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to enter final judgment in favor of Defendants. Plaintiffs may have until January 29, 2016 to move for attorneys' fees and costs.

PlaintiffsAppellants Muhammad Tanvir, Jameel Algibah, and Naveed Shinwari (\"Plaintiffs\") appeal from a February 17, 2016 final judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Abrams, J.), dismissing their complaint against senior federal law enforcement officials and 25 named and unnamed federal law enforcement officers. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that in retaliation for Plaintiffs' refusal to serve as informants, federal officers improperly placed or retained Plaintiffs' names on the \"No Fly List,\" in violation of Plaintiffs' rights under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000bb et seq. (\"RFRA\"). The complaint sought (1) injunctive and declaratory relief against all defendants in their official capacities for various constitutional and statutory violations, and (2) compensatory and punitive damages from federal law enforcement officers in their individual capacities for violations of their rights under the First Amendment and RFRA. After the parties agreed to stay the official capacity claims, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' individual capacity claims. As relevant here, the district court held that RFRA does not permit the recovery of money damages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities. Plaintiffs appeal that RFRA determination only. Because we disagree with the district court, and hold that RFRA permits a plaintiff to recover money damages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities for violations of RFRA's substantive protections, we reverse the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.

    "summary": "<p>On October 1, 2013, an American Muslim man who was repeatedly denied boarding flights in the United States because of his alleged inclusion on the federal No Fly List, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), which created and maintained the No Fly List. On April 22, 2014, an amended complaint was filed, adding three additional American Muslim men that had been denied boarding on flights originating in or destined for the United States because of their alleged inclusion on the No Fly List.</p><p>The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights as well as private counsel, alleged that the defendants had used the No Fly List to punish and retaliate against them for declining to act as informants, and to spy on others, for the FBI. The plaintiffs were opposed to doing so for religious, moral, and political reasons. More specifically, some plaintiffs found themselves on the No Fly List shortly after refusing to become informants for the FBI. Later, the FBI told these plaintiffs that they could get off the No Fly List only if they agreed to work for the FBI. Other plaintiffs were approached by the FBI shortly after being denied boarding on flights and were told they would be removed from the No Fly List if they agreed to work for the FBI.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that their inclusion on the No Fly List constituted: (1) retaliation in violation of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, association, and religion; (2) violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA); (3) denial of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment because the defendants failed to give the plaintiffs any meaningful notice or opportunity to see or challenge the asserted reasons for their inclusion; and (4) unlawful agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  </p><p>The plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. More specifically, the plaintiffs sought removal of their names from the No Fly List; declaratory and injunctive relief stating that they were kept on the No Fly List without cause and in retaliation for their assertion of constitutional rights in refusing to work for the FBI; and declaratory and injunctive relief stating that the No Fly List lacks due process and permits misuse. </p><p>The parties entered into discovery, during which the defendants filed two separate motions to dismiss on July 28, 2014. The first, on behalf of the Government, sought to dismiss all official capacity claims. The second, on behalf of the Agents, sought to dismiss all personal capacity claims.</p><p>On June 1, 2015, the Government moved to stay the official capacity claims. The government had revised the redress procedures available through administrative procedures as a result of the decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12886\"><em>Latif v. Holder</em></a>, 28 F. Supp. 3d 1134 (D. Or. 2014), which held various aspects of the process inadequate under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the APA. The plaintiffs had elected to use these revised procedures, so the government argued for a stay of the plaintiffs' official capacity claims while the administrative process occurred. The government argued that the claims were likely to become moot in light of the revised procedures. Initially, the plaintiffs opposed the motion to stay. But, after the government advised the plaintiffs that it knew of \"no reason\" why they would be unable to fly in the future, the plaintiffs agreed and voluntarily stayed their official capacity claims on June 10, 2015. The parties continued to litigate the monetary claims against the defendants in their personal capacities.  </p><p>On September 3, 2015, the court (Judge Ronnie Abrams) dismissed all of the plaintiffs' personal capacity claims against the federal employees. The court held that the plaintiffs were not permitted to seek damages against the federal employees under either <em>Bivens</em> or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 128 F. Supp. 3d 756 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). The order did not address the plaintiffs' official capacity claims regarding the manner in which individuals are added to the No Fly List or the procedures for challenging such inclusion. The court directed the plaintiffs to advise the court whether they wished to proceed on the official capacity claims. Responding to the court, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss those remaining claims. Accordingly, on December 28, 2015, the court dismissed the remaining claims.</p><p>Final judgment in favor of the defendants was entered on February 17, 2016. The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision holding that the RFRA did not permit the recovery of money damages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities. On May 2, 2018, the Second Circuit Court reversed this opinion, and on June 25, 2018, the opinion was amended. The court found that the RFRA permits individual capacity suits against government officers acting under color of law, and that money damages are an appropriate remedy. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</p><p>The Solicitor General of the United States petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. On November 22, 2019, the Supreme Court granted the petition. After a slight delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Court heard oral argument on October 6, 2020.</p><p>The Court issued its opinion on December 10, 2020. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Thomas, the Court affirmed the Second Circuit and held that RFRA permits litigants to obtain money damages from federal officials in their individual capacities. Justice Thomas noted that RFRA permits plaintiffs to obtain relief \"against a government,\" and that Congress defined \"government\" to include \"official[s] (or other person acting under color of law).\" Justice Thomas determined that appropriate relief against government officials may include money damages, especially when damages are the only remedy that could cure a RFRA violation. </p><p>Although there has been no further action on the district court docket as of January 14, 2021, this case presumably is ongoing because the money damages were not determined in the initial proceedings. </p>",

HARLEY III, STEVEN \nLNU, MICHAEL LNU, GREGG \nGROSSOEHMIG, WEYSAN DUN,  \nJAMES C. LANGENBERG, and  \nJOHN DOES 1–13 \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nRONNIE ABRAMS, United States District Judge: \nPlaintiffs Muhammad Tanvir, Jameel Algibhah, Naveed Shinwari, and Awais Sajjad bring \nthis suit to remedy alleged violations of their constitutional and statutory rights.  Each is either a \nlawful permanent resident or citizen of the United States, and each is Muslim.  They claim that as \npart of the U.S. Government’s efforts to bolster its intelligence gathering in the aftermath of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, they were asked to become informants by agents of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  When they refused because, among other things, serving \nas informants would contradict their sincerely held religious beliefs, they say the Government \nretaliated against them by placing or maintaining their names on its “No Fly List,” even though \n\nthey posed no threat to aviation security.  Since then, each Plaintiff claims to have been denied a \nboarding pass on at least one occasion, leaving him unable to visit loved ones who live abroad.  To \nredress this alleged violation of their rights, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against numerous federal \nofficials, including Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh C. \nJohnson, FBI Director James B. Comey, and 25 named and unnamed FBI and Homeland Security \nagents.   \nPlaintiffs seek relief on two bases.  First, they seek injunctive and declaratory relief against \nall of the defendants in their official capacities.  These claims arise under the First and Fifth \nAmendments of the Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706, \nand the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq.  \nPlaintiffs assert that these constitutional and statutory provisions entitle them to an order from this \nCourt requiring the Government to halt its alleged investigative tactics and to create fair procedures \ngoverning who is placed on the No Fly List and how such individuals may contest their inclusion.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs also seek compensatory and punitive damages from each of the individual agent \ndefendants in their personal capacities.  They argue that they are entitled to such monetary relief \nunder the First Amendment and RFRA.   \nAs explained in further detail below, the official capacity claims were stayed at the request \nof the parties on June 10, 2015, two days after the Government advised Plaintiffs that it knew of \n“no reason” why they would be unable to fly in the future.  The personal capacity claims, however, \nremain active.  This opinion concerns only those claims and, more specifically, resolves a motion \nbought by all but two of the individual agents (“Agents”), who seek to dismiss the personal \ncapacity claims against them.1  The Agents argue, among other things, that the remedy Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n1 Pursuant to the Stipulation and Order filed July 24, 2014, see Dkt. 30, Defendants FNU (i.e., first name \nunknown) Tanzin, John LNU (i.e., last name unknown), Steven LNU, Michael LNU and John Does 1–6 and 9–13 are \n  2   \n\nseek from them—money damages from each of the agents personally—is unavailable as a matter \nof law.  For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees and will grant the Agents’ motion. \nBACKGROUND2 \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Factual Allegations \nPlaintiffs claim that they are “among the many innocent people” who have been “swept \nup” in the years since 9/11 by the U.S. Government’s “secretive watch list dragnet.” ¶ 4.  Although \nthey acknowledge that the No Fly List is a critical national security tool meant to ensure that \nindividuals believed to be threats to aviation security are not allowed to board airplanes, ¶¶ 2, 40, \nPlaintiffs argue that the process for placing individuals on the No Fly List is “shrouded in secrecy \nand [thus] ripe for abuse,” ¶ 63.  Plaintiffs contend their names are on the No Fly List only because \nthey are the victims of abusive—and illegal—investigative tactics.  And they say that they were \nunable to do anything about their unjust inclusion because of the pervasive secrecy surrounding \nthe List. \nThe No Fly List is a database compiled and maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center \n(TSC), an agency within the FBI.  ¶ 40.  Federal agencies may “nominate” individuals for inclusion \nin the Government’s various terrorist databases, including the No Fly List, if there is a “reasonable \nsuspicion” that they are “known or suspected terrorist[s].”  ¶ 41.  An individual should only be \nplaced on the No Fly List if there is additional “derogatory information” showing that he “pose[s] \n                                                 \ncurrently proceeding under the pseudonyms specified in the First Amended Complaint, Dkt. 15.  John Doe 2 is \ncurrently proceeding as John Doe 2/3.  This motion is not brought by John Does 7 and 8 because the Government to \ndate has not been able to identify those Defendants and, accordingly, they have not been served.  On December 18, \n2014, the Court extended Plaintiffs’ time to serve John Does 7 and 8 through 30 days after a decision on this motion.  \nSee Dkt. 78. \n2 The facts as alleged by Plaintiffs are drawn from their Complaint.  All citations in this opinion preceded by \n“¶ ” or “¶¶ ” refer to paragraphs of the Complaint.  For purposes of this motion, the Court must accept Plaintiffs’ \nallegations as true.  See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007). \n  3   \n\na threat of committing a terrorist act with respect to an aircraft.”  ¶ 42.  Anyone whose name is on \nthe list is barred from boarding a flight that starts or ends in the United States, or flies over any \npart of the country.  ¶ 44.  Beyond this, however, little is known about the No Fly List.  ¶ 43.  \nAlthough they do not have information about its exact size, Plaintiffs assert that the List has grown \nmore than six times over from roughly 3,400 names in 2009 to over 21,000 in 2012.  ¶ 47.  The \nTSC itself has found that “many” of these thousands of individuals were placed on the No Fly List \neven though they did not qualify.  ¶ 48.  For example, a federal district court in California recently \nconcluded that a Muslim doctoral student at Stanford was placed on the No Fly List because an \nFBI agent checked the wrong boxes on a nominating form.  ¶ 49 (citing Ibrahim v. Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., 62 F.Supp.3d 909, 916 (N.D. Cal. 2014)). \nPlaintiffs claim that each of the federal agents named in this suit, instead of utilizing the \nNo  Fly  List  based  on  legitimate  information  for  legitimate  purposes,  have  “exploited  the \nsignificant burdens imposed by the No Fly List, its opaque nature and ill-defined standards, as well \nas its lack of procedural safeguards, in an attempt to coerce Plaintiffs into serving as informants \nwithin their American Muslim communities and places of worship.”  ¶ 8.  Plaintiffs further allege \nthat higher-level officials—including the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and \nDirector  of  the  FBI—“promulgated,  encouraged  and  tolerated  a  pattern  and  practice  of \naggressively recruiting and deploying informants in American Muslim communities.”  ¶ 67. \nAlthough the details of each of the four Plaintiffs’ experiences with the No Fly List are \ndifferent, they follow the same broad contours.  Each man was born into the Islamic faith in a \nforeign country where at least some of his family members remain.  Each legally immigrated to \nthis country and is now lawfully present here, either as a citizen or permanent resident.  Each \nclaims he was asked to become an informant for the FBI and to share what he learned by, for \n  4   \n\nexample, traveling abroad to Pakistan or Afghanistan, participating in online Islamic forums, or \nattending certain mosques.  Each declined to do so.  Each was placed or kept on the No Fly List \nand thus was unable to fly for sustained periods over several years, unable to see loved ones.  Yet \neach asserts that he does not—and has never—posed a threat to aviation security.  Rather, each \nmaintains that the Agents worked together to add or keep his name on the No Fly List because he \nrefused to serve as an informant for the FBI.  \nIn light of the manner in which the Court resolves this motion, the specific details of each \nPlaintiff’s claims need not be discussed in detail.  Some discussion, however, is warranted, and \nTanvir’s story is illustrative.  He is a lawful permanent resident who presently lives in Queens, \nNew York.  ¶ 68.  His wife, son, and parents remain in Pakistan.  Id.  In February 2007, Tanvir \nalleges that FBI Special Agents FNU Tanzin and John Doe 1 approached him at the dollar store in \nthe Bronx where he then worked.  ¶ 69.  He was questioned for roughly 30 minutes about an old \nacquaintance whom the agents believed had entered the country illegally.  Id.  Nothing else about \nthat interaction appears to have been remarkable.  Two days later, however, Tanvir heard again \nfrom Agent Tanzin, who asked whether there was anything he “could share” with the FBI \nconcerning the American Muslim community.  ¶ 70.  Tanvir alleges that he told Tanzin that he \nknew nothing that would be relevant to law enforcement.  Id. \nFast-forward more than a year later to July 2008.  After returning from a trip in Pakistan to \nvisit his family, Tanvir asserts that he was detained for five hours by federal agents at John F. \nKennedy International Airport in New York.  ¶ 71.  Although he was not interviewed, his passport \nwas confiscated and he was given an appointment to pick it up on January 28, 2009, nearly six \nmonths later.  Id.  Two days before that appointment—and almost two years since they had last \nbeen in contact—Tanvir heard again from Agent Tanzin, this time joined by FBI Special Agent \n  5   \n\nJohn Doe 2/3,3 who visited him at his new workplace.  ¶ 73.  The agents asked him to accompany \nthem to the FBI’s New York field office in Manhattan.  Id.  Tanvir agreed, and once there, he was \nquestioned for about an hour.  ¶¶ 74–75.  Among other things, he was asked about terrorist training \ncamps near the village in Pakistan where he was raised and whether he had any Taliban training.  \n¶ 75.  Tanvir denied knowledge of or attendance at any such training camps.  Id.   \nToward the end of the hour, Agents Tanzin and John Doe 2/3 told Tanvir that they \nrecognized he was “special,” “honest,” and “hardworking,” and that they wanted him to work as \nan informant for the FBI.  ¶ 76.  Specifically, he asserts that they asked him to travel to Pakistan \nand report on what he learned.  Id.  They offered to facilitate visits to the United States for his \nfamily, and to provide financial assistance for his parents in Pakistan to travel to Saudi Arabia for \na religious pilgrimage.  Id.  Tanvir reiterated his earlier position:  He did not want to work as an \ninformant.  ¶ 77.  But the agents purportedly persisted, warning him that he would not receive his \npassport and that he would be deported to Pakistan if he failed to cooperate.  Id.   \nTanvir claims to have pleaded with the agents not to deport him because his family \ndepended on him financially.  ¶ 78.  He also said that he feared for his safety in Pakistan if he went \nthere as an American informant.  Id.  When the agents suggested he could work in Afghanistan \ninstead, he responded that that too would be dangerous.  Id.  (Although Tanvir also asserts that \nserving as a government informant would violate the tenets of his Muslim faith, ¶ 84, he does not \nappear to assert that he said as much to the agents.)  At the conclusion of the meeting, the agents \nadvised Tanvir to keep thinking, and cautioned him not to discuss their conversation with anyone.  \n¶ 78.  The next day, Agent Tanzin called Tanvir to ask whether he had changed his mind.  ¶ 79.  \n                                                 \n3 With respect to John Doe 2/3’s pseudonym, see supra note 1. \n  6   \n\nTanvir claims that Agent Tanzin reiterated that he would be deported if he failed to cooperate.  Id.  \nTanvir again declined.  Id. \nOn January 28, 2009, Tanvir went to JFK Airport to retrieve his passport, as previously \ninstructed.  ¶ 80.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials advised him that his passport \nhad been withheld for an investigation that had since been completed, and they returned the \ndocument to him without incident.  Id.  The next day, however, Agent Tanzin called Tanvir and \ntold him that his passport had been returned to him because he—Agent Tanzin—had instructed \nDHS officials to release the passport in recognition of the fact that Tanvir was being “cooperative” \nwith the FBI.  ¶ 81. \nThe Complaint alleges that the FBI agents’ attempts to persuade Tanvir to become an \ninformant continued over the next three weeks.  He received multiple telephone calls and visits \nfrom Agent Tanzin and John Doe 2/3 at his workplace.  ¶¶ 82–83.4  Eventually, Tanvir stopped \nanswering their calls, and when Agents Tanzin and John Doe 2/3 visited him at his workplace to \nask why, he told them that he no longer wished to speak with them.  ¶ 86.  They then asked him to \ntake a polygraph.  ¶ 87.  When he refused, they threatened to arrest him, but did not do so once \nTanvir said he would hire an attorney if they did.  Id.  Roughly six months later, in July 2009, \nTanvir traveled to Pakistan to visit his wife and parents.  ¶ 88.  While he was abroad, Agents \nTanzin and John Doe 2/3 visited his sister at her workplace in Queens and inquired about Tanvir’s \ntravel plans.  Id.  She was uncomfortable talking to the agents.  Id.   \nTanvir returned to the United States in January 2010, at which time he took a job as a long-\nhaul trucker.  ¶ 89.  His new job involved driving across the country and then taking a return flight \nto New York.  Id.  In October 2010, while Tanvir was in Atlanta for work, he received word that \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs advise that the Complaint “may” have incorrectly identified John Doe 2/3 as John Doe 1 in these \nparagraphs of the Complaint.  See Pls. Mem. at 10 n.6.  \n  7   \n\nhis mother was visiting New York from Pakistan.  ¶ 91.  He booked a flight back to New York, \nbut was advised by an airline agent at the check-in counter in Atlanta that he was not allowed to \nfly.  Id.  Two unknown FBI agents approached Tanvir at the airport and advised him to contact the \nagents who had spoken to him in New York.  Id.  They then drove him to a nearby bus station.  Id.  \nWhile waiting for a bus to New York, Tanvir called Agent Tanzin, who advised Tanvir that he \nwas no longer assigned to Tanvir.  ¶ 92.   Agent Tanzin told him, however, that other agents would \nbe contacting him soon and that he should “cooperate.”  Id.  These interactions led Tanvir to \nbelieve that Agents Tanzin and John Doe 1–3 placed him on the No Fly List “at some time during \nor before October 2010 because he refused to become an informant against his community and \nrefused to speak or associate further with the agents.”  ¶ 90.  His bus trip home to New York took \napproximately 24 hours.  ¶ 93.  \nTwo days after he returned to New York from Atlanta, the Complaint alleges that FBI \nSpecial Agent Sanya Garcia contacted Tanvir, telling him that she would assist him in getting off \nthe No Fly List if he met with her and answered her questions.  ¶ 94.  Tanvir told Garcia that he \nhad already answered the FBI’s questions and declined to meet with her.  Id.  Recognizing that he \nwas still unable to fly, Tanvir eventually quit his job as a truck driver because he could no longer \ntake a flight back to New York after completing his deliveries.  ¶ 95.  On September 27, 2011, he \nfiled a complaint with the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP).  ¶ 97.  This program \nprovides an administrative mechanism for removing one’s name from the No Fly List.  ¶¶ 21, 57–\n61. \nThe month after filing his TRIP complaint, Tanvir purchased tickets for a flight to Pakistan \nin November 2011.  ¶ 98.  The day before his flight, Agent Garcia called Tanvir and told him he \nwould not be allowed to fly unless he met with her.  ¶ 99.  Tanvir agreed because he needed to \n  8   \n\nreturn to Pakistan to visit his ailing mother.  ¶ 100.  At that meeting, he was asked the same \nquestions that Agents Tanzin and John Doe 2/3 had asked previously.  ¶ 101.  He answered them \nbecause he wanted to see his mother.  Id.  After the meeting, the agents told him that they would \nobtain a one-time waiver for him to fly, but that it would take several weeks to process.  ¶ 102.  \nTanvir begged Agent Garcia to let him fly the next day.  ¶ 103.  She said it might be possible, but \nshe changed her mind the next day.  ¶¶ 103–104.  When they spoke the next day, Agent Garcia \ntold Tanvir that he would not be able to fly until he submitted to a polygraph.  ¶ 104.  Tanvir \ncancelled his flight, obtaining only a partial refund from the airline.  Id.  He also hired a lawyer, \nwhom the agents referred to the FBI’s lawyers, who in turn told Tanvir’s lawyer to contact TRIP.  \n¶¶ 105, 107.  Tanvir again purchased a flight to Pakistan for travel in December 2011 in the hopes \nof visiting his mother, whose health continued to deteriorate.  ¶ 109.  He was denied boarding at \nthe airport—the third time he was unable to fly.  Id.   \nOn April 16, 2012, Tanvir received a response to his TRIP complaint, about six months \nafter having filed it.  ¶ 110.  The letter did not confirm that he was on the No Fly List, but stated \nonly that “no changes or corrections are warranted at this time.”  Id.  On May 23, 2012, he appealed \nthat determination and asked the Government to provide him with the information on which it had \nbased the determination that he could not be allowed to fly.  ¶ 112.   \nIn November 2012, Tanvir purchased another ticket to Pakistan and was again denied \nboarding at JFK Airport—the fourth time he was unable to fly.  ¶ 113. The Complaint alleges that \nTanvir and his lawyer, who had accompanied him to the airport, were approached by an FBI agent \nat the check-in counter, who informed them that Tanvir would not be removed from the No Fly \nList until he met with Agent Garcia.  Id. \n  9   \n\nOn March 28, 2013, ten months after he had filed his TRIP appeal—and well over two \nyears after he was first denied boarding in October 2010—Tanvir received a letter from DHS \nsuperseding its initial determination of April 16, 2012.  ¶ 114.  The letter stated, in part, that \nTanvir’s experience “was most likely caused by a misidentification against a government record \nor by random selection,” and that the Government had “made updates” to its records.  Id.  Tanvir \ndecided to try flying again and purchased another ticket.  Id. \nOn June 27, 2013, in what was his fifth attempt to fly since being denied boarding in \nOctober 2010, Tanvir successfully boarded a flight and flew to Pakistan.  ¶ 115.  He does not know \nwhether he was able to fly as a result of a one-time waiver provided by the agents or whether he \nhad been removed from the No Fly List.  Id.  Tanvir asserts that his placement on the No Fly List \nforced him to quit his job as a truck driver, prevented him from visiting his sick mother in Pakistan \nwhen he wished to, and resulted in financial losses, including lost income and expenses related to \nairline tickets.  ¶¶ 116–17.  He says that he also continues to fear harassment by the FBI, which \ncauses him and his family great distress.  ¶ 116. \nAs noted previously, Algibhah’s, Shinwari’s, and Sajjad’s allegations, including the nature \nof their interactions with the FBI, largely track those of Tanvir.  See generally ¶¶ 118–96.  As of \nthe time this action was commenced, Algibhah had not flown since the spring of 2009, which was \nthen the last time he saw his wife and daughters, who live in Yemen.  ¶ 143.  He has attempted to \nfly home twice since then and was denied boarding each time.  Id.  Algibhah asserts that several \nof the Agents kept his name on the No Fly List even after they determined he posed no threat to \naviation security so they could retaliate against him for his refusal to become an informant.  ¶ 135.  \nShinwari was able to fly domestically in March 2014 after first being denied boarding in March \n2012 while returning from Afghanistan, although he believed his name was still on the No Fly List \n  10   \n\nuntil he was advised otherwise in June 2015.  ¶ 169.  He too claims that he was denied the ability \nto fly because he refused to become an informant.  ¶ 159.  Sajjad was first denied boarding in \nSeptember 2012 while attempting to visit his family in Pakistan and, as of the time this motion \nwas briefed, had not attempted to fly again since, believing his name remained on the No Fly List.  \n¶¶ 173, 196.  Sajjad asserts that his name was kept on the No Fly List even after several of the \nAgents determined he had been wrongfully included as retaliation for his refusal to serve as an \ninformant.  ¶ 195.   \nB.  Procedural History \nPlaintiffs brought this action on October 1, 2013 and filed their operative Complaint on \nApril 22, 2014.  See Dkt. 15.  On July 28, 2014, two separate motions to dismiss were filed.  The \nfirst, on behalf of the Government, sought to dismiss all official capacity claims.  See Dkt. 34.5 \nThe second, on behalf of the Agents, sought to dismiss all personal capacity claims.  See Dkt. 38.  \nAfter briefing was completed, oral argument was scheduled for June 12, 2015.   \nOn June 1, 2015, the Government moved to stay the official capacity claims.  See Dkt. 89.  \nAs the Government explained, it had revised the redress procedures available through TRIP as a \nresult of the decision in Latif v. Holder, 28 F.Supp.3d 1134 (D. Or. 2014), which held various \naspects of the TRIP process inadequate under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the \nAPA.  See also Mohamed v. Holder, No. 1:11-CV-50 AJT/MSN, 2015 WL 4394958 (E.D. Va. \nJuly 16, 2015) (same); Dkt. 85 (notice from Government describing revised TRIP procedures).  \nPlaintiffs elected to avail themselves of these revised procedures.  And because Plaintiffs did so, \nthe Government argued a stay of Plaintiffs’ official capacity claims was warranted, as those claims, \n                                                 \n5 In light of the discussion below regarding the distinction between official and personal capacity claims, see \ninfra at 12–14, the Court refers to the defendants sued in their official capacity as “the Government.” \n  11   \n\nwhich primarily challenge the original TRIP procedures, were or were likely to become moot in \nlight of the revised TRIP procedures.   \nPlaintiffs initially resisted the Government’s request for a stay.  See Pls. Letter of June 3, \n2015, Dkt. 91.  But on June 8, 2015—less than a week before oral argument—Plaintiffs each \nreceived a letter from DHS advising them that: “At this time the U.S. Government knows of no \nreason you should be unable to fly.  This determination, based on the totality of available \ninformation, closes your DHS TRIP inquiry.”  See Pls. Letter of June 10, 2015, Dkt. 92.  In light \nof that development—apparently indicating that Plaintiffs are not now on the No Fly List—\nPlaintiffs consented to a stay of their official capacity claims.  Id.  The Court ordered such a stay \nand administratively terminated the official capacity motion to dismiss.  See Dkt. 93.  Only \nPlaintiffs’ claims against the Agents in their personal capacities remain active at this time.  \nDISCUSSION \nA.  Introduction \nThe difference between official capacity claims, which are not at issue in this motion, and \npersonal capacity (sometimes called “individual” capacity claims), which are, has long been a \nsource of confusion, see generally Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 163–68 (1985), and some \nbackground is appropriate given the centrality of those distinctions to the claims made here.  The \nstarting point is that “[a]bsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and \nits agencies from suit.”  F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994).  In other words, the \nGovernment cannot be sued without its consent.  That rule may bar a suit even when an action is \ncommenced against an individual government official instead of a governmental agency “if the \ndecree would operate against the latter,” Hawaii v. Gordon, 373 U.S. 57, 58 (1963) (per curiam), \nas is usually the case when a plaintiff seeks an order in the form of an injunction commanding or \n  12   \n\npreventing some action.  Such a suit is known as an “official” capacity claim because it is \neffectively a suit against the Government, regardless of the named party.6   \nIn 1976, Congress amended the APA to include a formal waiver of the United States’ \nsovereign immunity from claims “seeking relief other than money damages” against “an agency \nor an officer or employee thereof … in an official capacity or under color of legal authority.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 702; see also B.K. Instrument, Inc. v. United States, 715 F.2d 713, 723–25 (2d Cir. 1983) \n(describing Congress’s intention with the APA amendments to “eliminate the sovereign immunity \ndefense in all equitable actions for specific relief against a Federal agency or officer acting in an \nofficial capacity”) (quotation omitted).  As a result, sovereign immunity does not pose a barrier to \nclaims seeking injunctive or declaratory relief against the Government and its officers when they \nare sued in their official capacities. \nSignificant for present purposes, however, neither the APA nor any other statute relevant \nin this context waives the Government’s immunity (or the immunity of its officers sued in their \nofficial capacity) from damages claims.7  There is no disagreement among the parties on this point.  \nSee Pls. Mem. at 84; Defs. Reply at 1 n.1.  But this is the significance of suits against government \nofficials in their “personal” capacities:  Where an official is sued in his or her personal capacity, \n                                                 \n6 The Supreme Court has explained that the Government is the real party in interest “if the judgment sought \nwould expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration, or if the effect of the \njudgment would be to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.”  Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 620 \n(1963) (quotations omitted).  That approach reflects the commonsensical observation that the Government can act \nonly through agents and thus, for example, “when the agents’ actions are restrained, the sovereign itself may, through \n[the agents], be restrained.”  Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 688 (1949).  As a result, \nwhere the effect of a judgment would operate against the Government, a suit against a named federal officer “is not a \nsuit against the official [personally] but rather is a suit against the official’s office.”  Will v. Michigan Dep’t of State \nPolice, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).  Because these suits are really suits against the Government, when officials sued in \ntheir official capacity die or leave office, their successors automatically assume their roles in the litigation, as Attorney \nGeneral Loretta E. Lynch did in this case for former Attorney General Eric J. Holder.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(1); \nDkt. 93 (order substituting Lynch for Holder).   \n7 The United States has, however, waived its immunity from damages in other contexts.  See, e.g., the Tucker \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(a)(2), 1491 (certain contracts claims); see also United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212–\n16 (1983) (recounting history of the Federal Government’s waiver of immunity from suits for damages). \n  13   \n\nsovereign immunity does not apply.  Unlike official capacity suits, “[p]ersonal-capacity suits … \nseek to impose individual liability upon a government officer for actions taken under color of \n[federal] law.”  Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991) (emphasis added).  Because any award of \nmoney damages in such a suit (theoretically) comes from the official’s own pocket, there is no \nconcern about sovereign immunity.8  The common-law cause of action first recognized in Bivens \nv. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 are two mechanisms that may provide for personal capacity damages actions in the \nconstitutional context against federal and state officers, respectively, while several federal statutes \nmay provide for such damages in other contexts.9   \nHere, Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants sued in their \nofficial capacities and money damages from a subset of Defendants—namely, the Agents—in their \npersonal capacities.   See Pls. Mem. at 49 n.24.  As resolution of the official capacity claims has \nbeen left for another day by consent of the parties, this opinion addresses only whether the specific \ntheories by which Plaintiffs seek to recover damages from the Agents in their personal capacities \nare legally viable. Plaintiffs advance arguments under both Bivens and RFRA, a federal statute that \nprovides for “appropriate relief” in certain situations where an individual’s ability to freely \nexercise his faith has been substantially burdened by the Government or its agents.  42 U.S.C. § \n2000bb-1(c).  For the reasons that follow, neither of these two arguments ultimately succeeds.10 \n                                                 \n8 As a practical matter, the Government almost always indemnifies its officials from such suits and provides \nrepresentation through lawyers from the Department of Justice.  See 28 C.F.R. § 50.15.  Indeed, that is true for the \nAgents’ representation in this case. \n9 For examples of such statutes, see infra at 32. \n10 The Agents also argue pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over \nmultiple Agents.  See Defs. Mem. at 61–66.  After submissions from the parties concerning Plaintiffs’ request for \nlimited jurisdictional discovery in order to oppose that aspect of the Agents’ motion, the Court accepted the Agents’ \nsuggestion to defer consideration of that aspect of their motion to dismiss until the balance of the motion was resolved.  \nSee 09/16/2014 Tr. 36, Dkt. 69.  Given the holdings in this opinion, the personal jurisdiction arguments are now moot.  \n  14   \n\nB.  Bivens Is Unavailable in This Context  \nIn Bivens, the Supreme Court “recognized for the first time an implied private action for \ndamages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen’s constitutional rights.”  Corr. \nServs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 66 (2001).  Although initially predicated on the traditional \nunderstanding that the existence of a right must imply a remedy, see Bivens, 403 U.S. at 397 (citing \nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803)), the Supreme Court has since “rejected the claim \nthat a Bivens remedy should be implied simply for want of any other means for challenging a \nconstitutional deprivation in federal court,” Malesko, 534 U.S. at 69.  Thus, although sometimes \ndescribed as “the federal analog to suits brought against state officials under [42 U.S.C. § 1983],” \nHartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 2545 n.2 (2006), Bivens is far more limited than § 1983 because \n“a Bivens remedy is not available for all who allege injury from a federal officer’s violation of \ntheir constitutional rights,” Turkmen v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 218, 234 (2d Cir. 2015).  Indeed, a Bivens \naction “is not an automatic entitlement no matter what other means there may be to vindicate a \nprotected interest, and in most instances … a Bivens remedy [is] unjustified.”  Wilkie v. Robbins, \n551 U.S. 537, 550 (2007). \nA federal court asked to imply a Bivens remedy in 2015 must approach that task with \ncircumspection.  Although the Supreme Court has twice implied Bivens actions since Bivens itself \nwas decided, see Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979) (employment discrimination in violation \nof Due Process Clause); Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980) (Eighth Amendment violation by \nprison officials), in the more than three decades since the last of the Bivens trilogy was decided, \nthe Supreme Court has “consistently refused to extend Bivens liability to any new context or new \ncategory of defendants,” Malesko, 534 U.S. at 68; accord Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559, 571 (2d \n                                                 \nFinally, the Agents have argued that the claims against John Does 1 and 2/3 are time-barred.  See Defs. Mem. at 66–\n69.  The Court need not reach that argument in light of its conclusion that no relief is available against them. \n  15   \n\nCir. 2009) (en banc) (“[T]he Bivens remedy is an extraordinary thing that should rarely if ever be \napplied in new contexts.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nThe Supreme Court’s refusal to recognize a new Bivens action since 1980 is not for want \nof opportunity.  See, e.g., Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983) (federal employee’s claim that his \nfederal employer dismissed him in violation of the First Amendment); Chappell v. Wallace, 462 \nU.S. 296 (1983) (claim by military personnel that military superiors violated various constitutional \nprovisions); United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987) (similar); Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 \nU.S. 412 (1988) (claim by recipients of Social Security disability benefits that benefits had been \ndenied in violation of the Fifth Amendment); Meyer, 510 U.S. 471 (former bank employee’s suit \nagainst a federal banking agency, claiming that he lost his job due to agency action that violated \nthe  Fifth  Amendment’s  Due  Process  Clause);  Malesko,  534  U.S.  61  (prisoner’s  Eighth \nAmendment-based suit against a private corporation that managed a federal prison); Wilkie, 551 \nU.S. 537 (ranch owner’s claim for harassment and intimidation against federal land management \nofficials under  Fourth  and Fifth Amendments); Minneci  v. Pollard, 132 S. Ct.  617 (2012) \n(prisoner’s  Eighth  Amendment-based  claim  against  employees  of  privately-operated  federal \nprison).   \nAlthough the Court has on each of these occasions explained its refusal to extend Bivens \nwith reasons specific to the particular context, this generation of Bivens jurisprudence appears \nrooted in the more fundamental judgment that “‘Congress is in a far better position than a court to \nevaluate the impact of a new species of litigation’ against those who act on the public’s behalf.”  \nWilkie, 551 U.S. at 562 (quoting Bush, 462 U.S. at 389); see also E. Chemerinsky, Federal \nJurisdiction § 9.1, p. 633 (6th ed. 2011) (“There is no way to understand the law concerning Bivens \nsuits except in the context of how the Court’s attitudes toward such claims has changed.”).  Indeed, \n  16   \n\none Justice has observed that it is “doubtless correct that a broad interpretation of [Bivens’] \nrationale would logically produce [its] application [in more contexts],” but noted that he was “not \ninclined (and the Court has not been inclined) to construe Bivens broadly.”  Malesko, 534 U.S. at \n75 (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).  As a consequence, “[w]hatever presumption in \nfavor of a Bivens-like remedy may once have existed has long since been abrogated.”  Vance v. \nRumsfeld, 701 F.3d 193, 198 (7th Cir. 2012) (en banc). \nAgainst that background, the Second Circuit’s recent decision in Turkmen, which was \nhanded down only days after oral argument on this motion, is instructive—and, indeed, dispositive.  \nAs in this case, Turkmen raised “a difficult and delicate set of legal issues concerning individuals \nwho were caught up in the post–9/11 investigation even though they were unquestionably never \ninvolved in terrorist activity.”  789 F.3d at 224.  The plaintiffs in Turkmen were eight Muslim or \nArab non-citizens who were detained by the federal government in the aftermath of 9/11.  Id.  \nWhile detained, they were, among other things, allegedly subjected to frequent physical and verbal \nabuse, denied copies of the Koran for weeks or months after requesting them, denied the Halal \nfood required by their Muslim faith, and mocked by prison officials while they prayed.  Id. at 227–\n28.  For these alleged injuries, the plaintiffs sought, among other things, a Bivens remedy against \nvarious government officials under the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.  Id. at 225. \nIn light of the Supreme Court’s—and the Second Circuit’s—repeated admonitions against \nextending Bivens to new contexts, Turkmen carefully analyzed the context of the claims asserted \nby the plaintiffs there.  The panel majority looked to “both the rights injured and the mechanism \nof the injury.”  Id. at 234; accord Arar, 585 F.3d at 572 (defining context as “a potentially recurring \nscenario that has similar legal and factual components”).  It explained that the rights injured were \nthose secured by the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, the Fifth Amendment’s Due \n  17   \n\nProcess Clause, and the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches, id. at \n235–37, while the mechanism of injury involved “punitive conditions [of confinement in a federal \nfacility in the custody of federal officials] without sufficient cause,” id. at 235.  Significant for \npresent purposes, although the panel determined that the combination of rights injured and \nmechanism of injury “st[ood] firmly within a familiar Bivens context” with respect to the Turkmen \nplaintiffs’ Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims, see id. at 235, 237 (collecting cases), that was not \nso with respect to their First Amendment claim.  With respect to that claim, “it [was] the right \ninjured—Plaintiffs’ free exercise right—and not the mechanism of injury that place[d] Plaintiffs’ \nclaims in a new Bivens context.”  Id. at 236.  As the panel majority explained, “the Supreme Court \nhas ‘not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise Clause’ and has ‘declined to \nextend Bivens to a claim sounding in the First Amendment.’”  Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 675 (2009)); accord id. at 268 n.3 (Raggi, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) \n(“[T]he  Supreme  Court  [has]  consistently  declined  to  extend  a  Bivens  remedy  to  a  First \nAmendment claim in any context.”) (emphasis in original); Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, \n2093, n.4 (2012) (“We have never held that Bivens extends to First Amendment claims.”).  Indeed, \nTurkmen leaves no doubt that recognizing a “free exercise claim would require extending Bivens \nto a new context”—“a move [the panel] decline[d] to make absent guidance from the Supreme \nCourt.”  789 F.3d at 237.  In so concluding, the panel explicitly reversed the holding of the district \ncourt.  See Turkmen v. Ashcroft, 915 F.Supp.2d 314, 352 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“Bivens should be \nextended to afford the plaintiffs a damages remedy if they prove the alleged violation of their free \nexercise rights.”).   \nIn supplemental briefing, Plaintiffs seek to distinguish Turkmen by arguing that its holding \nis limited to free exercise claims, not the panoply of other rights under the First Amendment.  See \n  18   \n\nPls. Letter of July 14, 2015 at 1–2, Dkt. 97.  To that end, Plaintiffs assert that their Bivens claim is \ngrounded not merely in the Free Exercise Clause, but in several other First Amendment rights, \nincluding “the freedom of speech … and the closely-intertwined right of free association.”  Id. at \n2.11  Although Plaintiffs are no doubt correct that the Turkmen plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim \nwas  limited  to  the  Free  Exercise  Clause,  they  overlook  the  fact  that  Turkmen  itself  is \nunambiguously predicated on the understanding that the Supreme Court has never recognized a \nBivens claim in the First Amendment context at all.  See 789 F.3d at 236 (noting the Supreme \nCourt has “‘declined to extend Bivens to a claim sounding in the First Amendment’” (quoting \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 675).  That understanding is sufficient to conclude that the relief Plaintiffs seek \nhere requires extending Bivens to a new context, whether the right injured is freedom of speech, \nreligion, or association.  In other words, while Turkmen plainly forecloses a Bivens remedy for \nfree  exercise  claims,  the  decision  at  a  minimum  also  reiterates  the  Supreme  Court’s  own \npronouncements that any claim sounding in the First Amendment would require extending Bivens \nto a new context.12 \n                                                 \n11 Although the First Amendment’s text explicitly safeguards the freedom to speak and to worship (“Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the \nfreedom of speech …”), the Supreme Court has “long understood as implicit in the right to engage in activities \nprotected by the First Amendment a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of \npolitical, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.”  Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 \n(1984).  Whether Plaintiffs’ allegations sufficiently make out a First Amendment retaliation claim—under free \nexercise, speech, or association theories, see ¶¶ 200–01, 203—is an important question that the Court need not, and \ndoes not, reach in light of its conclusion that Bivens is unavailable in this context and the fact that the Agents have not \nraised the issue here.  Indeed, the Agents do not argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a First Amendment claim because, \nfor example, Plaintiffs’ refusal to cooperate is not protected speech or protected associational activity under the First \nAmendment, or that the Agents’ alleged conduct could not infringe Plaintiffs’ free exercise rights.  Rather, their \nargument appears to be limited to the claim that “Plaintiffs fail to allege that each Agent defendant was a proximate \ncause of, or personally involved in, Plaintiffs’ alleged inclusion on the No Fly List,” Defs. Mem. at 39, and that  “the \nalleged First Amendment rights at issue were not clearly established,” id. at 51; see also Defs. Reply at 34–37.  But \nsee Ayala v. Harden, No. 1:12-CV-00281-AWI, 2012 WL 4981269, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2012)  (concluding in \nsummary fashion that “[r]efusal to become an informant is not a protected First Amendment activity”).   \n12 Although Plaintiffs cannot be faulted for pointing to a sentence in the Supreme Court’s decision in Hartman \nsuggesting the availability of a Bivens remedy in the anti-retaliation context, see Pls. Mem. at 39–40, the Court has \nresolved any ambiguity created by Hartman in subsequent decisions by at least twice reiterating that it has never \nrecognized a Bivens claim in the First Amendment context.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 675 (“[W]e have declined to extend \n  19   \n\nEven assuming, however, that the right at issue did not place Plaintiffs’ claims in a new \ncontext, the mechanism of injury in this case surely does.  Although Plaintiffs argue that the FBI \nagents’ use of the No Fly List to retaliate against them merely represents “a new tool [that] does \nnot transform a familiar pattern of misconduct into a novel context for purposes of recognizing a \nBivens claim,” Pls. Mem. at 43, Turkmen makes plain that this view is mistaken.  A distinct \nmechanism of injury—such as the extraordinary rendition alleged in Arar—can “present[] a new \n                                                 \nBivens to a claim sounding in the First Amendment.”); Reichle, 132 S. Ct. at 2093 n.4 (“We have never held that \nBivens extends to First Amendment claims.”) \nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari in Hartman to determine whether plaintiffs in retaliatory-prosecution \nsuits bear the burden of showing a lack of probable cause.  See 547 U.S. at 255–56.  At the time, the D.C. Circuit, \nfrom where Hartman emerged, had long recognized a Bivens action in the First Amendment context, see, e.g., Dellums \nv. Powell, 566 F.2d 167 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (Bivens available for false arrest of Vietnam War protestors on U.S. Capitol \nsteps), and specifically for retaliatory prosecution, see, e.g., Haynesworth v. Miller, 820 F.2d 1245, 1274 (D.C. Cir. \n1987).  The petitioners in Hartman did not seek review—nor did the Supreme Court grant review—on the predicate \nquestion of whether Bivens was available for First Amendment retaliation.  It was against that background that Justice \nSouter, in an introductory paragraph of his opinion, observed that “[w]hen the vengeful [prosecutor] is [a] federal \n[officer], he is subject to an action for damages on the authority of Bivens,” and cited Bivens without further analysis.  \nId. at 256. \nBut in light of Hartman’s posture—and the careful consideration that the Supreme Court has given to the \navailability of Bivens in each context where it has recognized Bivens’ availability—that single sentence simply cannot \nbear the weight Plaintiffs would put on it.  Bivens’ availability “was not at issue” in Hartman, “the point … was not \nthen fully argued,” and the Court “did not canvas the considerations” it invariably does in such cases.  Kirtsaeng v. \nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 1351, 1368 (2013).  As such, Hartman is better read as assuming—not deciding—\nthe question of Bivens’ availability in the First Amendment retaliation context.  See, e.g., Wood v. Moss, 134 S. Ct. \n2056, 2066 (2014) (observing eight years after Hartman was decided that “we have several times assumed without \ndeciding that Bivens extends to First Amendment claims”).  Indeed, Iqbal explicitly noted that “[t]he legal issue \ndecided in Hartman concerned the elements a plaintiff ‘must plead and prove in order to win’ a First Amendment \nretaliation claim.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 673 (quoting Hartman, 547 U.S. at 257 n.5).  And while the Court has cited \nHartman on five occasions—including significant discussions in Iqbal and Reichle—not once has it suggested \nHartman decided the availability of a Bivens remedy for First Amendment retaliation.   \nPlaintiffs also correctly note that the Second Circuit once described Hartman as “reiterat[ing] the general \navailability of a Bivens action to sue federal officials for First Amendment retaliation.”  See M.E.S., Inc. v. Snell, 712 \nF.3d 666, 675 (2d Cir. 2013).  But even assuming that is a fair characterization of Hartman, Snell distinguished \nHartman and declined to imply a Bivens remedy for alleged First Amendment retaliation, id.; no other decision of the \nSecond Circuit has relied on Snell or Hartman for the proposition that Bivens is available for a First Amendment anti-\nretaliation claim; and the author of the Snell opinion was a member of the more recent Turkmen panel and agreed with \nthe panel majority that “the Supreme Court [has] consistently declined to extend a Bivens remedy to a First \nAmendment claim in any context,” 789 F.3d at 268 n.3 (Raggi, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis \nin original).  As such, Snell offers Plaintiffs little support for the proposition that a Bivens claim already exists for anti-\nretaliation claims.  The other out-of-circuit cases cited by Plaintiffs overread Hartman for the reasons discussed above.  \nSee, e.g., George v. Rehiel, 738 F.3d 562, 585 n.24 (3d Cir. 2013). \n  20   \n\ncontext for Bivens-based claims.”  Turkmen, 789 F.3d at 234.13  Here, Plaintiffs cannot point to \nany case recognizing a Bivens remedy for a federal officer’s retaliation against an individual by \nplacing  or  maintaining  that  individual’s  name  on  the  No  Fly  List  or,  more  generally,  any \ngovernment watch list.  Nor can Plaintiffs point to a case recognizing a Bivens action where the \nmechanism of injury was the imposition of a substantial burden on an individual’s ability to travel.  \nThus, whether viewed through the lens of the rights injured or the mechanism of injury, Plaintiffs \nask this Court to extend Bivens to a new context. \nGiven the current state of Bivens jurisprudence, the conclusion that Plaintiffs seek to extend \nBivens to a new context could end the inquiry.  Indeed, in Turkmen, the court declined to “extend[] \nBivens to a new context … absent guidance from the Supreme Court,” without undertaking any \nadditional analysis of whether Bivens might be appropriate in that context.  Id. at 237; see also \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 675 (observing that the Court’s “reluctance [to extend Bivens since 1980] might \nwell have disposed of respondent’s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination”).  That \nsaid, after concluding a given claim involves extending Bivens to a new context, a court should \ngenerally consider “(a) whether there is an alternative remedial scheme available to the plaintiff, \nand, even if there is not, (b) whether special factors counsel hesitation in creating a Bivens \nremedy.”  Turkmen, 789 F.3d at 234 (quotations omitted).  The Court will do so here.    \n                                                 \n13 Turkmen emphasizes the right at issue and the mechanism of injury in determining whether a claim presents \na new context.  When confronted with a new Bivens context, a court must assess whether an alternative remedial \nscheme exists before recognizing a Bivens remedy.  Turkmen, 789 F.3d at 234 (citing Arar, 585 F.3d. at 572).  That \ninquiry ensures, among other things, that a court does not imply a remedy for an injury when an alternative scheme to \nremedy that injury already exists.  A court need not consider alternative remedial schemes, however, where a claim \narises in an existing context, since the determination of whether or not Bivens is available in that context—and whether \nan alternate remedial scheme is available—has already been made.  Id. at 237 n.17.  Taking these two rules together \nmakes clear that a failure to also consider the injury in determining whether a claim presents a new context would \nshort-circuit the Bivens analysis because it risks ignoring a remedial scheme addressing that very injury.  Thus, the \nupshot of Plaintiffs’ favored approach, which would appear to ignore the particular form of injury as nothing more \nthan a “new tool,” would be the expansion of Bivens based solely on the right at issue without regard for remedial \nschemes that may exist—a result plainly contrary to the Supreme Court’s contemporary Bivens jurisprudence. \n  21   \n\nThe existence of a system of administrative and judicial remedies for individuals who have \nbeen improperly included on the No Fly List—the precise mechanism of injury in this case—is \nsufficient to conclude that Bivens should not be extended to this context.  Specifically, Congress \nhas directed the TSA to “establish a timely and fair process for individuals identified [under the \nTSA’s  passenger  prescreening  function]  to  appeal  to  the  [TSA]  and  correct  any  erroneous \ninformation.”  49 U.S.C. § 44903(j)(2)(G)(i).  The TSA is also required to “establish a procedure \nto enable airline passengers, who are delayed or prohibited from boarding a flight because the \nadvanced passenger prescreening system determined that they might pose a security threat, to \nappeal  such  determination  and  correct  information  contained  in  the  system.”  § \n44903(j)(2)(C)(iii)(I).  Congress also mandated that “[t]he Secretary of Homeland Security shall \nestablish a timely and fair process for individuals who believe they have been delayed or prohibited \nfrom boarding a commercial aircraft because they were wrongly identified as a threat under the \nregimes utilized by the [TSA],” § 44926(a), and that the Secretary “shall establish” procedures “to \nimplement, coordinate, and execute the process” for redress, § 44926(b)(1).  These legislative \ndirectives have resulted in the DHS TRIP program.  See 49 C.F.R. § 1560.201 et seq.  The TSA is \nalso required to maintain records for individuals whose information has been corrected through its \nredress process.  See §§ 44903(j)(2)(G)(ii), 44926(b)(2).  Finally, Congress has provided for \njudicial review of orders pertaining “to security duties and powers designated to be carried out by” \nthe TSA. § 46110(a).  The bottom line, then, is that Congress has crafted a remedial scheme for \nindividuals to challenge their inclusion on the No Fly List and to judicially appeal an adverse \ndetermination.14 \n                                                 \n14 In their official capacity claims, Plaintiffs argue that this scheme of judicial review is not exclusive and \nthat they have recourse in this Court under the APA for their claims concerning “the constitutional ‘adequacy’ of No \nFly List placement, redress, and removal procedures.”  Pls. Mem. at 25.  Two courts of appeal have agreed with this \nargument, albeit in the context of the original TRIP regime, not the revised one.  See Ibrahim v. Dep’t of Homeland \n  22   \n\nPlaintiffs respond that this remedial scheme does not provide for damages from the Agents \npersonally and, “[a]s such, TRIP and § 46110 are incapable of providing remedies for the \nconstitutional violations that the Special Agent Defendants committed.”  Pls. Mem. at 45.  The \nremedies Congress has chosen to provide, however, “need not be perfectly congruent,” Minneci, \n132 S. Ct. at 625, and they need not even “provide complete relief,” Bush, 462 U.S. at 388.  Indeed, \nalthough there can be no dispute here that the scheme created by Congress does not provide relief \nin the form of compensatory or punitive damages from the Government or the Agents, “[i]t does \nnot matter that the creation of a Bivens remedy would obviously offer the prospect of relief for \ninjuries that must now go unredressed.”  Hudson Valley Black Press v. I.R.S., 409 F.3d 106, 110 \n(2d Cir. 2005) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “That a particular plaintiff might suffer \n‘unredressed’ injuries were a court not to recognize a new type of Bivens action may be a hard \ntruth but it is a truth nonetheless and one to which the Supreme Court has alerted potential \nlitigants.”  Aryai v. Forfeiture Support Associates, 25 F.Supp.3d 376, 395 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) \n(Preska, C.J.).  The Court’s jurisprudence instructs that the salient point, rather, is that Congress \nhas provided “what it considers adequate” for the relevant injury.  Chilicky, 487 U.S. at 431 (1988) \n(emphasis added).15  “So long as the plaintiff[s] ha[ve] an avenue for some redress, bedrock \n                                                 \nSec., 538 F.3d 1250 (9th Cir. 2008); Latif v. Holder, 686 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2012); Arjmand v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 745 F.3d 1300 (9th Cir. 2014); Ege v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 784 F.3d 791 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Fourth \nCircuit has also adopted that reasoning in an unpublished opinion.  See Mohamed v. Holder, No. 11-1924, slip op. at \n4–6 (4th Cir. May 28, 2013).  Were the official capacity claims to proceed and were this Court to accept Plaintiffs’ \nargument, Plaintiffs would thus have a further remedial path that may be sufficient to preclude the availability of a \nBivens remedy.  See, e.g., Western Radio Servs. Co. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 578 F.3d 1116, 1123 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[T]he \nAPA leaves no room for Bivens claims based on agency action or inaction.”); Sinclair v. Hawke, 314 F.3d 934, 940 \n(8th Cir. 2003) (“[T]he existence of a right to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act is sufficient to \npreclude a Bivens action.”); Miller v. U.S. Dep’t of Agr. Farm Servs. Agency, 143 F.3d 1413, 1416 (11th Cir. 1998) \n(“[T]he existence of a right to judicial review under the APA is, alone, sufficient to preclude a federal employee from \nbringing a Bivens action.”). \n15 Analysis at this stage “include[s] an appropriate judicial deference to indications that congressional \ninaction has not been inadvertent.” Chilicky, 487 U.S. at 423. And as Plaintiffs’ themselves concede, “[t]he legislative \nhistory of the No Fly List remedial scheme shows that Congress considered, and struck down, an amendment that \nwould create a civil remedy against the Government if, following the TRIP review process, the TSC decided not to \nremove the complainant from the No Fly List.”  Pls. Mem. at 47 n.3.  See H.R. Rep. No. 108-724, pt. 5, at 270–71 \n  23   \n\nprinciples of separation of powers foreclose[] judicial imposition of a new substantive liability.”  \nMalesko, 534 U.S. at 69 (emphasis added).  Indeed, it appears that the alternative remedial scheme \nhere is far more comprehensive—and effective—than that available to the Turkmen plaintiffs.  Cf. \nTurkmen, 915 F.Supp.2d at 353. \nNor is it relevant that Congress may not have had constitutional violations of the sort \nalleged here—as opposed to administrative errors—in mind when crafting the administrative and \njudicial review scheme it did.  See Pls. Mem. at 44.  The Supreme Court has explicitly rejected the \nargument that a remedy is inadequate because claimants “merely received that to which they would \nhave been entitled had there been no constitutional violation.”  Chilicky, 487 U.S. at 427.  In both \nBush and Chilicky, the Court rejected claims that a Bivens remedy was necessary because the \nstatutory schemes did not provide for relief specifically intended to compensate a constitutional \nviolation (First Amendment retaliation and Due Process violations, respectively) as opposed to the \ndenial of a statutory right.  “In neither case … [did] the presence of alleged unconstitutional \nconduct that is not separately remedied under the statutory scheme imply that the statute has \nprovided ‘no remedy’ for the constitutional wrong at issue.”  Id. at 427–28 (emphasis in original).  \nAs Justice O’Connor explained in Chilicky, “the harm resulting from the alleged constitutional \nviolation can in neither case be separated from the harm resulting from the denial of the statutory \nright.”  Id. at 428.  The same is true here.  The crux of Plaintiffs’ injury is their improper inclusion \non the No Fly List as a result of the Agents’ alleged retaliation.  And whether that injury resulted \n                                                 \n(2004).  Plaintiffs seek to sidestep this legislative history because it concerns “a remedy against the Government, not \nindividual nominating agents.”  Pls. Mem. at 47 n.3.  But nowhere has the Supreme Court suggested that courts should \nlook only to whether Congress has considered the specific question of damages against federal officers in their \npersonal capacity.  Here, Plaintiffs agree that Congress considered the question of what remedies would be appropriate \nin the context of the No Fly List and specifically rejected the option of a civil remedy.  “Congress’s pronouncements \nin the relevant context [thus] signal that it would not support … a damages claim,” Lebron v. Rumsfeld, 670 F.3d 540, \n548 (4th Cir. 2012) (Wilkerson, J.), and reinforce the conclusion that a Bivens remedy is inappropriate here. \n  24   \n\nfrom administrative error, a constitutional violation, or both, the dispositive point is that Congress’ \nremedial scheme addresses precisely that injury. \nIn concluding that the remedial scheme crafted by Congress forecloses the recognition of \na Bivens action, the Court does not overlook the fact that Plaintiffs in their official capacity claims \nchallenge the procedural adequacy of that scheme.  This Court does not today consider whether \nthe TRIP process is constitutionally or otherwise deficient.  Because the official capacity claims \nare now stayed, the procedural adequacy of that scheme, including the TRIP process, is a question \nfor another day.  For purposes of assessing the viability of a Bivens claim, however, it is enough \nto recognize that an alternative remedial process is available.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have availed \nthemselves of that process and now have assurances from the Government that they are not \npresently on the No Fly List.  That is more than enough to conclude that the creation of a Bivens \nremedy is inappropriate in these circumstances. 16  \nC.  RFRA Does Not Provide for Damages Against The Agents \nPlaintiffs also seek damages against the Agents pursuant to RFRA.  Section 3 of that \nstatute, which creates a private right of action and provides for judicial remedies to enforce that \nright, states, in pertinent part, that: \nA person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of \nthis section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a \njudicial  proceeding  and  obtain  appropriate  relief  against  a \ngovernment. \n                                                 \n16 Because an alternative remedial scheme is available in this context, the Court need not proceed to the \nsecond stage of inquiry and consider the applicability of any additional special factors, including the parties’ divergent \narguments concerning the national security implications of recognizing a Bivens action in this context.  See Defs. \nMem. at 18–22; Pls. Mem. at 48–52. \n  25   \n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(c).  The principal question that divides the parties here is the meaning of \n“appropriate relief.”  Specifically, does the notion of “appropriate relief” encompass money \ndamages against government officials in their personal capacities?17  \n“Statutory construction begins with the plain text and, if that text is unambiguous, it usually \nends there as well.”  United States v. Gayle, 342 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 2003).  This is not the usual \ncase, however, because the plain text of RFRA merely raises, rather than answers, the critical \nquestion.  As the Supreme Court has recognized with respect to RFRA’s companion statute, which \nincludes identical language in this respect, the phrase “‘appropriate relief’ is open-ended and \nambiguous about what types of relief it includes.”  Sossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651 (2011).18  \nIndeed, “[f]ar from clearly identifying money damages, the word ‘appropriate’ is inherently \ncontext-dependent.”  Id.  “In some contexts, ‘appropriate relief’ might include damages.”  Webman \nv. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 441 F.3d 1022, 1026 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  But “another plausible reading \nis that ‘appropriate relief’ covers equitable relief but not damages.”  Id.  While the Supreme Court \nhas acknowledged the availability of injunctive relief under RFRA, see Gonzales v. O Centro \n                                                 \n17 The parties also dispute whether federal officials in their personal capacities are included within RFRA’s \ndefinition of “government” and thus amenable to suit under the statute at all.  At least two courts appear to have \nconcluded that RFRA applies to personal capacity claims against federal officials.  See United Elmaghraby v. Ashcroft, \nNo. 04-CV-1809 (JG), 2005 WL 2375202, at *30 n.27 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2005), aff’d in part, rev’d in part and \nremanded sub nom., Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2007), rev’d and remanded sub nom., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662 (2009); Solomon v. Chin, No. 96-CIV-2619 (DC), 1997 WL 160643, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 1997).  At \nleast one other court, however, has expressed some doubts about such a conclusion, at least in the national security \ncontext.  See Lebron, 670 F.3d at 557.  This Court need not address the issue, however, in light of its conclusion that \nmoney damages are unavailable under RFRA because, even assuming the Agents may be sued in their personal \ncapacities, Plaintiffs’ RFRA claim against the Agents in their personal capacities here is limited to money damages.  \nSee Pls. Mem. at 49 n.24.   \n18 When the Supreme Court held RFRA unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments because \nit exceeded Congress’ power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 519 \n(1997) (“Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what that right is.”), Congress responded by \nenacting the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U.S.C. § \n2000cc et seq., pursuant to its Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority.  See Sossamon, 131 S. Ct. at 1656.  \n“RLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA … includ[ing] an express private cause of action that is taken from \nRFRA.”  Id. at 1656.  For that reason, courts often apply “case law decided under RFRA to issues that arise under \nRLUIPA” and vice-versa.  Redd v. Wright, 597 F.3d 532, 535 n.2 (2d Cir. 2010). \n  26   \n\nEspirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 425–30 (2006), neither the Supreme Court \nnor any of the thirteen courts of appeals has held that RFRA provides for money damages.19  The \nquestion, then, remains: Does “appropriate relief” in the context of RFRA encompass such \ndamages?  The answer is no. \nAlthough the statute’s plain text is wanting in clarity, “[t]he purpose and history of the \nstatute elucidate the meaning of this ambiguous phrase.”  United States v. Tohono O’Odham \nNation, 131 S. Ct. 1723, 1736 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., concurring); see also King v. Burwell, 135 \nS. Ct. 2480, 2496 (2015) (“A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the \nlegislative plan.”).  Indeed, Congress included detailed findings and an unambiguous statement of \nthe law’s purpose in the statute itself.  Section 2 of RFRA, codified at § 2000bb(b), provides that:  \nThe purposes of this Act are— \n(1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in \nSherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972) and to guarantee its application in all cases \nwhere free exercise of religion is substantially burdened; and \n                                                 \n19 Three courts of appeals have held that RFRA does not provide for money damages against the United \nStates (or its agents acting in their official capacities) on the basis that “appropriate relief” cannot include damages \nbecause the language does not amount to an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity.  See Webman, 441 F.3d at \n1026; Oklevueha Native Am. Church of Haw., Inc. v. Holder, 676 F.3d 829, 841 (9th Cir. 2012); Davila v. Gladden, \n777 F.3d 1198, 1210 (11th Cir. 2015).  Although the Second Circuit has not addressed the issue, Plaintiffs agree with \nthat conclusion, see Pls. Mem. at 84, and instead bring this case focusing on the remaining gap in the RFRA \njurisprudence: whether a damages action exists against federal officials in their personal capacities.  Because these \ndecisions (and Sossamon) are grounded in principles of sovereign immunity, they are of limited assistance in \naddressing the question of damages against those who “come to court as individuals,” Hafer, 502 U.S. at 27.  At most, \nthey may counsel caution in concluding that the same term—even one as malleable as “appropriate relief”—can \ninclude damages as applied to one class of defendants but not another. \nThe Court has also considered the Agents’ argument concerning Washington v. Gonyea, 731 F.3d 143 (2d \nCir. 2013), which held that RLUIPA does not provide for damages against state officials in their personal capacities.  \nAs the panel explained, RLUIPA “was enacted pursuant to Congress’ spending power, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc–\n1(b)(1), which allows the imposition of conditions, such as individual liability, only on those parties actually receiving \nthe state funds.”  Id. at 145.  Because the parties receiving the federal funds were state prison institutions, not state \nprison officials, Gonyea concluded “as a matter of statutory interpretation and following the principle of constitutional \navoidance” that RLUIPA did not create a personal capacity damages action.  Id. at 146.  RFRA, by contrast, “was \nauthorized by the Necessary and Proper Clause.”  Hankins v. Lyght, 441 F.3d 96, 106 (2d Cir. 2006).  As such, the \ndoctrinal concerns underlying the conclusion in Gonyea do not assist here.  \n  27   \n\n(2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious \nexercise is substantially burdened by government. \nRFRA  was  enacted  three  years  after  the  Supreme  Court’s  watershed  decision  in \nEmployment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), which, as the Act itself recounts, “virtually \neliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by \nlaws neutral toward religion.”  § 2000bb(a)(4).  Prior to Smith, the Supreme Court had employed \na balancing test that took into account whether the challenged state action imposed a substantial \nburden on the right to free exercise of religion, and if it did, whether that action was necessary to \nserve a compelling government interest.  Applying this test, the Court held in Sherbert that an \nemployee who was fired for refusing to work on her Sabbath could not be denied unemployment \nbenefits.  374 U.S. at 408–409.  And applying a similar approach, the Court held in Yoder that \nAmish children could not be required by state law to remain in school until the age of 16 over the \nobjection of their parents, who viewed such education “as an impermissible exposure of their \nchildren to a ‘wordly’ influence in conflict with their beliefs.”  406 U.S. at 210–211, 234–236. \nThe plaintiffs in Smith were two individuals who had been fired from their jobs at a drug \nrehabilitation center because they had ingested peyote as part of a religious ceremony of the Native \nAmerican Church, of which they were both members.  494 U.S. at 874.  They were subsequently \ndenied state unemployment benefits after being found ineligible because of their discharge for \nwork-related “misconduct.”  Id.  Citing Supreme Court precedent, including Sherbert, the Oregon \nSupreme Court concluded that “the state could not, consistent with the First Amendment, deny \nunemployment compensation to petitioners.”  Smith v. Employment Div., 307 Or. 68, 71 (1988).  \nThe Supreme Court reversed.   \nIn his opinion for the closely divided Court, Justice Scalia noted that its decisions “have \nconsistently held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to \n  28   \n\ncomply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes \n(or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).”  Smith, 494 U.S. at 879 \n(quotation omitted).  Indeed, Smith cautioned that “a private right to ignore generally applicable \nlaws” would prove “a constitutional anomaly.”  Id. at 886.  In so concluding, Smith distinguished \nthe Court’s earlier decisions in Sherbert and Yoder, confining the former to its facts, see id. at 884–\n85, and holding that the latter involved more than just the free exercise of religion, see id. at 881 \n(discussing “the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections,” such \nas the right of parents to direct the education of their children).  Notable for present purposes, \nSmith did not change the remedies available for a successful claim under the Free Exercise Clause.  \nIndeed, it says nothing about remedies at all. \nCongress responded to Smith by affording greater statutory protection than the Court in \nSmith had held the Constitution offered.20   Specifically, it concluded that “the compelling interest \ntest as set forth in prior Federal court rulings”—that is, in Sherbert and Yoder—offered “a \nworkable  test  for  striking  sensible  balances  between  religious  liberty  and  competing  prior \ngovernmental interests.”  § 2000bb(a)(5).  As a result, in enacting RFRA, Congress sought “to \nrestore the compelling interest test as set forth” in those earlier cases.  § 2000bb(b).  The Act thus \n                                                 \n20 While some have spoken of RFRA “overturning” Smith, “a statute cannot either enlarge or contract the \nConstitution.”  Mack v. O’Leary, 80 F.3d 1175, 1181 (7th Cir. 1996), vacated on other grounds, 522 U.S. 801 (1997).  \nThat Congress would seek to create a new statutory right that exceeded constitutional baselines, however, is not \nremarkable.  “Indeed, Congress has often provided statutory protection of individual liberties that exceed the Supreme \nCourt’s interpretation of constitutional protection.”  Hankins, 441 F.3d at 107 (quotation omitted).  In that respect, one \naspect of RFRA’s test is significant.  As noted in City of Boerne, “the Act imposes in every case a least restrictive \nmeans requirement—a requirement that was not used in the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.”  521 \nU.S. at 535.  “On this understanding of [the Supreme Court’s] pre-Smith cases, RFRA did more than merely restore \nthe balancing test used in the Sherbert line of cases; it provided even broader protection for religious liberty than was \navailable under those decisions.”  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2761 n.3 (2014).  As discussed \nbelow, however, that breadth did not include expanding the scope of remedies available as compared with those \npreviously available for constitutional violations. \n  29   \n\ncreated a new statutory right beyond the constitutional baseline articulated in Smith by providing \nthat: \nGovernment  may  substantially  burden  a  person’s  exercise  of \nreligion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the \nperson— \n(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; \nand \n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.  \n§ 2000bb–1.  In order to ensure that this new statutory right (albeit one based in erstwhile \nconstitutional doctrine) could be vindicated in the courts, Congress also created a private right of \naction in § 3 providing for “appropriate relief” against the Government. \nPlaintiffs, however, see something more ambitious in RFRA.  In addition to restoring the \nstandard by which free exercise claims were adjudicated, Plaintiffs appear to argue the language \nin  § 3 demonstrates  Congress’ intent  to  expand the scope of remedies  available  where  an \nindividual’s religious freedom is abridged.  But as Judge Posner persuasively noted shortly after \nRFRA became law, since the statute “says very little about remedies … it is unlikely that Congress \nintended it to displace the existing remedial system for constitutional violations.”  Mack v. \nO’Leary, 80 F.3d 1175, 1181 (7th Cir. 1996), vacated on other grounds, 522 U.S. 801 (1997).  \nIndeed, nothing in the Act’s Congressional findings or statements of purpose says anything about \nchanging the remedial scheme applicable to free exercise claims.  And nothing on the face of the \nAct’s substantive provisions outwardly suggests they do anything other than carry out the law’s \nstated purpose—namely, restoring the compelling interest test as it existed before Smith.  As noted \nin the discussion of official and personal capacity claims above, see supra 12–14, a Bivens action \nwould have provided the only potential path for an individual seeking personal capacity damages \n  30   \n\nfrom a federal official for violation of the Free Exercise Clause at the time of RFRA’s enactment.  \nAnd as also discussed at length above, the Supreme Court has never recognized a Bivens remedy \nfor violations of the Free Exercise Clause.  See supra at 17–20.  As a consequence, to interpret \nRFRA’s reference to “appropriate relief” as contemplating a remedy then unknown to the law is, \nat the least, a stretch.  Rather, the plain language of the statute read in the light of its stated purpose \nsuggests the law changed the standard applicable to free exercise claims while retaining all \nremedies that were understood as “appropriate” for claims under the Free Exercise Clause—and \nnothing more. \nThe conclusion that RFRA did not displace the existing remedial scheme—whether by \nadding to or removing from it—is reinforced by the statute’s legislative history.  Indeed, both \nHouse and Senate committee reports, which are regarded as “the most authoritative and reliable \nmaterials of legislative history,” Disabled in Action of Metro. New York v. Hammons, 202 F.3d \n110, 124 (2d Cir. 2000), evidence concern about the potential misinterpretation of RFRA’s impact \non existing law.  For example, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s report states that “[a]lthough the \npurpose of this act is only to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith, concerns have been \nraised that the act could have unintended consequences and unsettle other areas of the law.”  S. \nRep. No. 103–111 (“S. Rep.”) at 12; see also H.R. Rep. No. 103–88 (“H.R. Rep.”) at 8 (including \nessentially identical language). In particular, the legislative history includes discussion of the bill’s \npotential impact on abortion rights, the ability of religious organizations to participate in publicly \nfunded social welfare and educational programs, and the availability of tax emptions for such \norganizations.  See S. Rep. at 12; H.R. Rep. at 8.  Thus, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s report \nstates that: \nTo be absolutely clear, the act does not expand, contract or alter the \nability of a claimant to obtain relief in a manner consistent with the \n  31   \n\nSupreme  Courts’s  [sic]  free  exercise  jurisprudence  under  the \ncompelling governmental interest test prior to Smith. \nS. Rep. at 12; see also H.R. Rep. at 8 (including essentially identical language).  In view of such \nan understanding—and against a backdrop where the Supreme Court has never recognized a \nBivens remedy under the Free Exercise Clause, whether before or after Smith—it would seem \nstrange indeed for Congress to have employed a phrase as ambiguous as “appropriate relief” to \ncreate such a remedy where one was not previously recognized.   \nThe contrast between the language in RFRA’s remedial provision and every other federal \nstatute identified by Plaintiffs as recognizing a personal capacity damages action against federal \nofficers also points away from the conclusion they urge.  Indeed, each of these four statutes \nincludes specific reference to the availability of damages.  Section 1985’s remedial clause speaks \nof “an action for the recovery of damages.”  42 U.S.C. § 1985.  The Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act permits “recover[y] … [of] actual damages … [and] punitive damages.”  50 \nU.S.C. § 1810.  The Telecommunication Acts provides that a court “may award damages.”  47 \nU.S.C. § 605(e)(3).  And although the Federal Wiretap Act provides for “appropriate relief,” that \nterm is specifically defined to include “damages … and punitive damages in appropriate cases.”  \n18 U.S.C. § 2520(b).  Because Congress knows how to create a personal capacity damages remedy \n(and because Plaintiffs have not  pointed to  a single statute where “appropriate relief” was \ninterpreted to include such a remedy without an explicit definition to that effect), one might \nreasonably expect such language if Congress in fact intended to depart from the pre-Smith world \nin such a significant way.21 \n                                                 \n21 Plaintiffs correctly observe that 42 U.S.C. § 1983, although usually concerned with the activities of state \nofficials, also provides for damages against a federal official in his personal capacity where “state and federal \ndefendants conspire[] under color of state law to deprive plaintiff[s] of federally guaranteed rights.”  See Kletschka v. \nDriver, 411 F.2d 436, 442, 448–49 (2d Cir. 1969).  Even § 1983, however, is clear that appropriate relief under that \n  32   \n\nNonetheless, Plaintiffs contend that Congress’s reference to “appropriate relief” in RFRA’s \nprivate right of action triggers the “ordinary convention” recognized in Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. \nPub. Sch., whereby courts “presume the availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress \nhas expressly indicated otherwise.”  503 U.S. 60, 76, 66 (1992); see also Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. \n678, 684 (1946) (“[W]here legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a \ngeneral right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good \nthe wrong done.”).  But whatever force of that rule in some contexts, it lacks any here.  As noted \nin Sossamon, which interpreted this very statutory provision as borrowed in RFRA’s companion \nstatute,22 Franklin required the Supreme Court to interpret the scope of an implied statutory right \nof action.  “With no statutory text to interpret, the Court ‘presume[d] the availability of all \nappropriate remedies unless Congress ha[d] expressly indicated otherwise.’”  Sossamon, 131 S. \nCt. at 1660 (quoting Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66); accord Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. \n244, 285 n.38 (1994).  That is not the case here, however, as Congress has created “an express \nprivate cause of action” that provides for “appropriate relief.”  Sossamon, 131 S. Ct. at 1656.  The \nFranklin presumption is thus inapplicable, and the meaning of “appropriate relief” must be \ndiscerned using the traditional tools of statutory construction.  Those tools, as noted above, point \n                                                 \nstatute includes “an action at law,” which is to say, damages.  See City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, \nLtd., 526 U.S. 687, 710–11 (1999). \nPlaintiffs also note that Congress has sometimes specifically excluded damages from their definitions of \n“appropriate relief” and that “numerous” federal statutes specifically include injunctive and other equitable relief \nwithin their definitions of “appropriate relief.”  See Pls. Mem. at 83–84 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702; 42 U.S.C. § 6395(e)(1); \n15 U.S.C. § 797(b)(5); 16 U.S.C. § 973i(e); 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(6)(A); 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(f)(2); 12 U.S.C. § 1715z–\n4a(b); 15 U.S.C. § 6309(a)).  None of these statutes, however, concerns the creation of a damages remedy against \nfederal officers in their personal capacities and, as such, the value of Plaintiffs’ analogy is diminished.  In any event, \nthe Supreme Court has “several times affirmed that identical language may convey varying content when used in \ndifferent statutes, sometimes even in different provisions of the same statute.”  Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074, \n1082 (2015) (collecting cases). \n22 See supra note 18. \n  33   \n\nto the conclusion that Congress did not intend to create a Bivens-type action with the language of \n“appropriate relief.”  \nPlaintiffs also seek support in Jama v. U.S.I.N.S., 343 F.Supp.2d 338 (D.N.J. 2004), where \nthe court determined that RFRA provides for personal capacity damages against federal officers.  \nBut that decision, and subsequent district court opinions adopting its reasoning,23 rest on a crucial \nyet flawed premise—that “[c]ourts have always recognized § 1983 and Bivens claims for money \ndamages against officials for violation of the Free Exercise Clause.”  Id. at 374 (emphasis added).  \nSetting aside the § 1983 cases, which have no bearing on whether a claim exists under Bivens, \nthere is no question—in light of Iqbal, Reichle, and, most recently, Turkmen—that the Supreme \nCourt has never recognized a Bivens remedy for violations of the Free Exercise Clause.  See supra \nat 17–21.24  Indeed, before RFRA was enacted in 1993, the Supreme Court’s only Bivens case in \nthe First Amendment context came in the form of its refusal to recognize such an action in Bush—\ndecided a full decade before RFRA became law. \n                                                 \n23 See Lepp v. Gonzales, No. C-05-0566 (VRW), 2005 WL 1867723, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 2, 2005); Padilla \nv. Yoo, 633 F.Supp.2d 1005, 1039 (N.D. Cal. 2009), as amended, (June 18, 2009), rev’d on other grounds, 678 F.3d \n748 (9th Cir. 2012);  \n24 Jama’s (and Plaintiffs’) sole citation to contrary authority is a single decision of the Sixth Circuit \nconcerning a prisoner’s free exercise claim.  In that case, Jihaad v. O’Brien, 645 F.2d 556 (6th Cir. 1981), the court \nadopted the holding of an earlier panel extending Bivens to the First Amendment as a whole—not merely to Free \nExercise Clause, see id. at 558 n.1.  That prior panel’s reasoning on this point was as follows: “We recognize that \nBivens dealt with a Fourth Amendment violation, but its logic appears to us to be equally applicable to a First \nAmendment violation.”  Yiamouyiannis v. Chem. Abstracts Serv., 521 F.2d 1392, 1393 (6th Cir. 1975).  Although \nsuch reasoning may have seemed perfectly reasonable in 1975 (shortly after Bivens was decided), it has become \nuntenable in the years after 1980, as cases such as Turkmen ably demonstrate.  Indeed, the Sixth Circuit itself recently \nexpressed doubts about the availability of Bivens in the free exercise context, notwithstanding its earlier holdings in \nYiamouyiannis and Jihaad.  See Meeks v. Larsen, No. 14-1381, ___ F.App’x. ___, 2015 WL 2056346, at *9 (6th Cir. \nMay 5, 2015) (observing that “there is a dearth of precedent applying Bivens to free-exercise claims” and quoting the \nEighth Circuit’s conclusion that Bivens’ availability in such contexts is “doubtful”). \nPlaintiffs also point to Mack for the proposition that at least one court of appeal has concluded that \n“appropriate relief” includes personal capacity damages.  See Pls. Mem. at 85.  But such reliance is difficult to justify \nbecause defendants there did not contest the availability of damages.  As Judge Posner’s opinion in that case observed, \nthey “d[id] not question the propriety of damages as a remedy for violations of the Act, even though [RFRA] says \nnothing about remedies except that a person whose rights under the Act are violated ‘may assert that violation as a \nclaim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.’”  80 F.3d at 1177 (citing \n§ 2000bb–1(c), emphasis added in Mack).   \n  34   \n\nIn the end, “the fundamental task for the judge is to determine what Congress was trying \nto do in passing the law.”  R. Katzmann, Judging Statutes 31 (2014); see also Lehigh Valley Coal \nCo. v. Yensavage, 218 F. 547, 553 (2d Cir. 1914) (Hand, J.) (“[S]tatutes … should be construed, \nnot as theorems of Euclid, but with some imagination of the purposes which lie behind them.”)  As \nexplained, Congress’ intent in enacting RFRA could not be clearer:  It was to restore Congress’ \nunderstanding of the compelling interest test as it existed before Smith—no more, no less.  And \n“[b]ecause Congress enacted RFRA to return to a pre-Smith world, a world in which damages were \nunavailable against the government, ‘appropriate relief’ is most naturally read to exclude damages \nagainst the government.”  Webman, 441 F.3d at 1028 (Tatel, J., concurring).25  Plaintiffs’ argument \nto the contrary thus fails.26 \nCONCLUSION \nAlthough federal law imposes limits on the investigative tactics federal officials may \nemploy in seeking to keep this nation safe, it also establishes limits on the manner in which an \nindividual may vindicate his rights should those tactics cross the line.  For the reasons stated, the \nlaw does not permit Plaintiffs to seek damages against the Agents in their personal capacities either \nunder Bivens or RFRA.  Accordingly, the Agents’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED and the claims \n                                                 \n25 RFRA provides only for relief “against the government,” which is defined to include “a branch, department, \nagency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States, or of a covered \nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb–2(1).  As noted above, see supra note 17, the Court need not address the predicate \nquestion of whether “the government” includes federal officials sued in their personal capacity in light of its conclusion \nthat “appropriate relief” does not encompass damages in any event. \n26 Plaintiffs’ argument might carry more weight were the Supreme Court eventually to recognize a Bivens \nremedy in the First Amendment context.  The Supreme Court has observed, in a related context, that “[t]he meaning \nof the word ‘appropriate’ permits its scope to expand to include … remedies that were not appropriate before …, but \nin light of legal change … are appropriate now.”  West v. Gibson, 527 U.S. 212, 218 (1999) (holding that Title VII’s \nreference to “appropriate remedies” as passed in 1972 should be interpreted to include compensatory damages in light \nof subsequent legal developments in 1991).  Thus, were the Supreme Court to recognize a Bivens remedy under the \nFree Exercise Clause, it might well be that “appropriate relief” under RFRA would be held to encompass personal \ncapacity damages. \n  35   \n\nagainst FNU Tanzin,  Sanya Garcia,  Francisco Artusa, John LNU, Michael Rutowski, William \nGale, John C. Harley III, Steven LNU, Michael LNU, Gregg Grossochmig, Weysan Dun, James \nC. Langenberg, John Does 1-6 and 9-13 in their personal capacities are dismissed. The Court on \nits own motion also dismisses all personal capacity claims against John Does 7 and 8.  See Hecht \nv.  Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 26 n.6 (2d Cir. 1990).  As previously noted, this \nopinion does not address the viability of Plaintiffs' official capacity claims and thus expresses no \nopinion on the merits of their arguments concerning the manner in which individuals are added to \nthe No Fly List or the mechanisms for challenging such inclusion.  The parties are directed to \nsubmit a joint letter to the Court within 30 days advising how they wish to proceed with respect to \nthose claims. \nSO ORDERED. \n__ \nDated:  September 3, 2015  ,. \n___ \nNew York, New York \n•.  ..\" \"\"~----\n~~~· \n--;:;1/\"~~:;:::::;:::::;:;=----- -~~~~~~~~-\nnm e  rams \nl  nited States District Judge \n36 ",

The \nOpinion also directed the parties to advise the Court as to how they wish to proceed with respect \nto Plaintiffs' official capacity claims against Defendants.

The only significant \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 109   Filed 12/28/15   Page 2 of 3\ndifference between them is that Plaintiffs' proposed order recites what Plaintiffs describe as \"basic \nprocedural facts that led to the dismissal.\"  Id. at 1.  Plaintiffs seek to have \"these facts be set forth \nin a judicially-issued document.\"  Id. at 2.

This is an action for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages under Bivens, seeking\nto remove Muhammad Tanvir, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, from the\nfederal government's No Fly List, and to challenge the FBI's practice of abusing this U.S.\ngovernment watch list to force American Muslims into serving as informants against their\nown communities. Mr. Tanvir is one of many individuals whom Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) agents have placed on the No Fly List in retaliation for their refusal to\nwork as informants against their communities and to submit to questioning. FBI agents have\nalso unlawfully coerced individuals into cooperating and serving as informants by promising\nto take them offthe No Fly List.\n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 2 of 30\n2.  Defendants create, maintain and implement a blacklist that prevents individuals named on it \nfrom boarding a flight to, from or over the United States under any circumstances (barring \nwaiver  from the government). The  No Fly List—one among several government watch \nlists—purports to be filled with the names of individuals too dangerous to fly under any \ncircumstances, with any degree of additional search and scrutiny, but not worthy of arrest and \ncriminal process. \n3.  Plaintiff Muhammad Tanvir, a lawful permanent resident, was denied the right to board \nflights, deprived of his right to travel, and wrongly stigmatized as a security threat. Yet the \ngovernment did not inform him of any reason why he presented a risk to civil aviation, and \ncontinues to deny him any after-the-fact explanation for his listing, and any meaningful \nassurance that his name is definitively cleared from the No Fly List.  \n4.  Mr. Tanvir was placed on the No Fly List after he was approached by FBI agents and asked \nto serve as an informant in his predominantly Muslim community. He refused. Subsequently, \nhe was suddenly and without notice banned from flying. After his listing, he reached out to \nthose same FBI agents to clear up what he presumed was an error that led to his placement on \nthe No Fly List. Instead of providing that explanation or opportunity, FBI agents offered to \nhelp him get off the No Fly List—but only in exchange for relaying information about his \ncommunity. Mr. Tanvir again refused. \n5.  Mr. Tanvir has been prevented from flying despite the fact that he does not present any threat \nto aviation security. Instead, defendants sought to exploit the draconian burden posed by the \nNo Fly List—including the inability to travel for work, or to visit family overseas—in order \nto coerce him into serving the FBI as a spy within American Muslim communities and places \nof worship. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 3 of 30\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702. Declaratory relief is \navailable pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n7.  This Court is a proper venue for this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because \ndefendants are officers and employees of the United States or its agencies operating under \ncolor of law, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims have \noccurred and are occurring in this judicial district.  \nPARTIES \n \n8.  Plaintiff Muhammad Tanvir is a lawful permanent resident who resides in Queens, New \nYork. He has lived in the United States since 2002 and has been married since March 2, \n2006. Because of his placement on the No Fly List, Mr. Tanvir was unable to visit his ailing \nmother for over two years. Mr. Tanvir has never been convicted of a crime nor does he pose \nany threat to aviation safety. \n9.  Defendant James B. Comey is the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The \nFBI is one of the agencies responsible for nominating individuals to government watch lists, \nknown collectively as the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), and which includes the No \nFly List. The FBI oversees the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), which maintains the TSDB. \nWhen an individual on the No Fly List participates in the limited redress process known as \nDepartment  of  Homeland  Security  Traveler  Redress  Inquiry  Program  (“DHS  TRIP”)  to \nchallenge his inclusion on the No Fly List, if that individual was nominated by the FBI, then \nthe FBI coordinates with TSC in determining whether an individual should remain on the \nwatch lists. Defendant Comey is sued in his official capacity. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 4 of 30\n10. Defendant Christopher M. Piehota is the Director of the TSC. The TSC is responsible for \nmaintaining the No Fly List and for reviewing and accepting nominations from originating \nagencies such as the FBI. The TSC is also responsible for removing individuals from the No \nFly List when requested by the nominating agency. In addition, in the redress process, the \nTSC is responsible for making the final determination whether to remove an individual from \na watch list. Defendant Piehota is sued in his official capacity. \n11. Defendant Rand Beers is the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS). The DHS maintains and administers the TRIP program and is the point of contact for \nindividuals  seeking  redress  for  being  unable  to  fly.  The  DHS  is  also  responsible  for \noverseeing the establishment of a timely and fair redress process for individuals who believe \nthey were wrongly identified as a threat. Defendant Beers is sued in his official capacity. \n12. Defendant John S. Pistole is the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration \n(TSA). The TSA is a screening agency responsible for implementing the No Fly List at \nairports.  The  TSA  receives  the  List  from  the  TSC  without  the  underlying,  classified \nintelligence,  and  it  in  turn  implements  the  List  at  the  airport,  determining  whether  an \nindividual should be denied boarding.

In the past decade, the FBI has engaged in a policy and practice of targeting American \nMuslim communities for suspicionless surveillance and intelligence-gathering, without any \nfactual basis to believe that specific violations or threats to national security exist. These law \nenforcement  policies  and  practices  have  included  the  aggressive  recruitment  of  and \ndeployment of informants in Muslim communities, organizations, and houses of worship. \n18. The identification and recruitment of informants, known in FBI parlance as Confidential \nHuman Sources, is an important part of FBI agents’ intelligence collection duties. The FBI \nmaintains over 15,000 informants, a number that excludes unofficial informants. Many of \nthem are tasked with infiltrating American Muslim communities. \n19. Over  the  past  decade,  FBI  recruitment  of  informants  has  significantly  expanded.  A \nNovember 2004 Presidential Directive required an increase in “human source development \nand management.” In a 2007 statement before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nDefendant Pistole described the FBI response to this directive, which includes changes to the \npolicies  intended  to  “enhance  the  FBI's  ability  to  share  human  intelligence  information \nwithin its organization and will encourage [Special Agents] to open and operate new Human \nSources.” The FBI’s 2008 fiscal year budget authorization request includes funding for a \n                                                                                                                                                             \n2 Possible alternative spellings could include “Sania,” “Sonya,” or “Sonia.” \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 6 of 30\nprogram to track and manage the growing number of informants. Many of these informants \nare recruited from and placed among Muslim communities. \n20. FBI informants are often tasked with infiltrating mosques and participating in religious-based \nactivities. For example, in Orange County, FBI agents sent an informant, Craig Monteilh, to \nvarious Southern California mosques to pose as a convert to Islam. Court documents and \nsworn testimony describe how he was tasked to infiltrate religious activities and to record \nreligious lectures, discussion groups and classes, and other religious and cultural events \noccurring in mosques. In order to accomplish this, Mr. Monteilh publicly converted to Islam \nin  front  of  a  crowd  of  hundreds.  Another  FBI  informer  was  asked  to  secretly  tape \nconversations of the Muslim community and to go into a mosque in Lodi, California.  \n21. FBI agents have a number of investigative techniques at their disposal as they identify and \nrecruit informants. Some of these are laid out in the FBI’s 2011 Domestic Investigations and \nOperations Guide (“DIOG”), which implement the 2008 Attorney General’s Guidelines for \nDomestic FBI Operations, which govern the FBI’s conduct in criminal, national security, and \ncounter-intelligence  assessments  and  investigations.  See  Fed.  Bureau  of  Investigation, \nDomestic  Intelligence  Operations  Guide  §  4.3(C)(2),  available  at \nhttp://vault.fbi.gov/FBI%20Domestic%20Investigations%20and%20Operations%20Guide%\n20(DIOG). \n22. The DIOG allows for six types of “assessments” of individuals or groups. An assessment is a \nlow-level investigation that does not require factual predication, or a factual indication of \ncriminal  wrongdoing.  According  to  data  obtained  by  investigative  journalists  through \nFreedom  of  Information  Act  requests,  from  2009  to  2011,  FBI  agents  opened  42,888 \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 7 of 30\nassessments of people or groups to see whether they were terrorists or spies;41,056 of the \nassessments yielded no indication of terrorist activity.  \n23. According to the DIOGs, an FBI agent opens a “Type 5” assessment when determining \nwhether  or  not  an  individual  is  suited  to  become  an  informant.  Agents  may  conduct \ninvestigations on a particular individual to determine whether he is suitable as a Confidential \nHuman  Source  (“CHS”);  they  may  also  conduct  investigations  without  any  specific \nindividual in mind, in order to identify individuals with “placement and access to particular \ninformation.” \n24. A Type 5 assessment may be based in part on religion or activities protected by the First \nAmendment. \n25. Once an individual is identified, the DIOGs allow the FBI agent to evaluate the “background, \nauthenticity, and suitability of a particular potential” informant, and to recruit a suitable  \ninformant. If the recruitment is successful, the Type 5 Assessment must be closed. If it is not \nsuccessful, “either because the individual declines to become a CHS or a determination is \nmade not to continue the recruitment,” the assessment must also be closed. But unless such a \ndetermination is reached, the assessment may remain open. \n26. A 2005 FBI Office of  Investigator General Report evaluating  FBI  compliance with the \nAttorney General’s Guidelines on the Use of Confidential Informants has found one or more \ncompliance errors in 87 percent of the informant files the Inspector General examined.3 The \n  \nReport also found serious compliance deficiencies with provisions in the Guidelines relating \nto approval, monitoring, documentation, and notification of confidential informants. The \n                                                 \n3 OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GEN., DEP’T OF JUSTICE, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION’S COMPLIANCE WITH \nTHE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL’S  INVESTIGATIVE  GUIDELINES  7  (2005),  available  at \nhttp://www.justice.gov/oig/special/0509/final.pdf. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 8 of 30\nReport noted that FBI personnel felt that the Guidelines’ requirements were cumbersome and \nonerous. \n27. To  recruit  informants,  FBI  agents  often  resort  to  exploiting  Muslim  individuals’ \nvulnerabilities. Civil rights organizations have documented instances where FBI agents have \nthreatened Muslim individuals with withholding their immigration benefits, or to facilitate \nimmigration benefits – a practice that is not allowed under the Attorney General’s Guidelines \nRegarding the Use of Confidential Human Sources.4  One FBI training presentation obtained \nby civil liberties organizations on recruiting informants in the Muslim community suggested \nthat  agents  exploit  “immigration  vulnerabilities”  because  Muslims  in  the  U.S.  are  “an \nimmigrant community.” \n28. Civil rights organizations have also reported that a wide variety of government interactions \nwith Muslim individuals, such as interactions with Customs and Border Patrol upon entering \nthe United States, will lead to subsequent and unrelated attempts to recruit those individuals \nas informants. \n29. Muslim  individuals  have  also  been  threatened  with  prosecution,  often  on  minor,  non-\ndangerous charges, if they refuse to become informants.  \nThe No Fly List \n \n30. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), which is administered by the FBI, develops and \nmaintains the federal government’s consolidated Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), the \nfederal  government’s  terrorist  watch  list.  In  September  2003,  Attorney  General  John \nAshcroft established the TSC to consolidate the federal government’s approach to terrorism \nscreening.  Although  the  TSA,  Customs  and  Border  Patrol,  and  various  other  front-line \n                                                 \n4 DEP’T. OF JUSTICE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S GUIDELINES REGARDING THE USE OF CONFIDENTIAL HUMAN \nSOURCES 245, available at https://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fbi/chs-guidelines.pdf. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 9 of 30\nagencies  that  engage  in  screening  of  individuals  for  varied  purposes  may  use  records \nprovided by the TSC, it is the TSC that maintains and controls the TSDB. \n31. The No Fly List is a subset of this master watch list. Individuals named on the No Fly List \nwill be categorically barred from boarding an aircraft for (at minimum) flights that originate, \nterminate, or pass over the United States, absent a specific waiver from the government. The \nNo Fly List is thus distinct from another list—known as the Selectee List—used to identify \npassengers who will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny at TSA security screening \ncheckpoints and at customs on return from international travel. Individuals on the Selectee \nList are not barred from boarding but are forced to submit to additional searches before doing \nso.  \n32. A number of federal agencies may nominate individuals to the TSC for inclusion on the \nconsolidated TSDB watch list. The FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center are the \nprimary agencies responsible for making nominations to the TSDB. When the FBI nominates \nan individual for inclusion, the TSC makes the final decision on whether the nominated \nindividual purportedly meets the minimum requirements for inclusion on the watch list as a \n“known or suspected terrorist,” based on a summary of underlying information provided by \nan FBI case agent. \n33. Nominations to the TSDB are supposed to be based on a “reasonable suspicion” that the \nindividual is a known or suspected terrorist derived from the totality of the information \nreviewed. According to TSC, the nominator’s “[m]ere guesses or ‘hunches’” are insufficient, \nas  are  race,  ethnicity,  nationality,  religion,  or  protected  First  Amendment  speech  or \nassociation; instead, “reasonable suspicion requires articulable facts which, taken together \nwith rational inferences, reasonably warrant the determination that an individual ‘is known or \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 10 of 30\nsuspected to be, or has been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of or \nrelated to, terrorism and terrorist activities.’” As of 2007, TSC rejected only approximately \none percent of nominations to the TSDB. \n34. The FBI also nominates individuals to be included specifically on the No Fly List. Additional \nunderlying “derogatory information” is required if a nominator suggests the inclusion of an \nindividual not only on the TSDB but on the No Fly List as well. Although the operation of \nthe No Fly List suggests that individuals placed on it must somehow present threats to \naviation security that cannot be mitigated if allowed to board an airplane, the government has \nnot  specified  publicly  what  standards  or  criteria  are  applied  to  determine  whether  an \nindividual on the consolidated TSDB watch list will additionally be placed on the No Fly \nList. The TSDB reportedly contains 875,000 names as of May 2013. Data provided to \nCongress in 2009 indicated that 1600 names were added to the watch list every day. The No \nFly  List  contained  approximately  21,000  individuals  as  of  February  2012,  including \napproximately 500 United States citizens. \n35. The TSC disseminates watch list data in a variety of forms to a variety of agencies including \nthe  Transportation  Security  Administration,  which  uses  TSC-provided  data  to  screen \ntravelers  for  commercial  flights.  Such  information  is  also  disseminated  to  cooperating \ngovernments for use by their agencies.  \n36. The TSC provides the No Fly List to the TSA for use in pre-screening airline passengers. \nBecause the data disseminated to the TSA is unclassified, the list provided includes only \nidentifiers such as name, date of birth, etc. and not the underlying information provided by \nthe nominator to purportedly justify inclusion. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 11 of 30\n37. The  TSA  screens  travelers  by  conducting  a  name-based  search  of  a  passenger  prior  to \nboarding. If that person has been placed on the No Fly List by the TSC, he or she will be \ndenied boarding.  \nAbuse of the No Fly List to Pressure Individuals to Become Informants \n38. FBI agents have used placement on the No Fly List as a way to pressure individuals to work \nas informants. According to publicly available information, the FBI has placed individuals on \nthe No Fly List as a way to pressure them to submit to questioning by government agents. \nThe FBI has also conditioned removal from the No Fly List upon agreeing to work for or \nsubmit to questioning by government agents.  \n39. Mr. Yonas Fikre, a United States Citizen, has filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that FBI \nagents placed him on the No Fly List in order to coerce him into becoming a government \ninformant.  According to the complaint, on or about April 21, 2010, his wife called him in \nSudan, where he was pursuing a business opportunity, and told him that she received a call \nfrom the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum asking that Mr. Fikre contact a United States Embassy \nofficial, Mr. Noordeloos. Mr. Fikre called Mr. Noordeloos, who invited him to the U.S. \nEmbassy in Khartoum. When Mr. Fikre arrived at the Embassy he was subjected to an \ninterrogation and prevented from leaving the room. FBI Agent Noordeloos also told Fikre \nthat  he  wanted  him  to  work  with  the  Agents  on  a  “case”  that  was  developing.  Agent \nNoordeloos asked Fikre to come in the next day. Fikre agreed because he wanted to leave. \nThe next day, Fikre called Agent Noordeloos to tell him that he was not interested in serving \nas an informant. Agent Noordeloos was upset, and told Fikre that when he wanted to travel \nback to the United States, he would have to go to the U.S. embassy. On June 15, 2010, Mr. \nFikre traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he was stripped of his passport and \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 12 of 30\ntortured. Ultimately, he was unable to return to the United States because he had been placed \non the No Fly List. \n40. Michael Migliore, a dual citizen of the USA and Italy, had traveled by ship to Europe \nbecause he was on the U.S. government’s No Fly List. Mr. Migliore believes he was placed \non the List after he refused to be interviewed by the FBI without an attorney present.  \n41. In June 2012, Mr. Kevin Iraniha was boarding a flight home to San Diego on Frontier \nAirlines with his two brothers and father when he was informed that he was on the No Fly \nList. Mr. Iraniha went to the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica. Once there, he was questioned \nextensively by FBI agents about his religious beliefs, his attendance and contacts at mosques \nin Costa Rica.  Mr. Iraniha states that he felt pressured to speak to the FBI agents.  \n42. In June 2009, Mr. Amir Meshal was denied boarding at Newark International Airport and \nwas informed that he was on the No Fly list. In October 2010, an FBI agent offered to \nremove Mr. Meshal from the No Fly list if he agreed to serve as a government informant. Mr. \nAbe Mashal, an Illinois resident, was prevented from boarding a flight from Chicago, and \ntold that he was on the No Fly List. Later that same day, FBI agents came to his home and \nquestioned him. A few months later, the same agents asked him to become an undercover \ninformant, promising to remove him from the  No Fly  List if he agreed to spy  for the \ngovernment. \n43. Mr. Nagib Alo Ghaleb, a naturalized U.S. Citizen residing in San Francisco, traveled to \nYemen in 2010 to visit his wife and children. Upon his return to the U.S., an FBI agent \ninformed him at the Frankfurt airport in Germany that he would not be allowed back into the \nU.S.  As  a  result,  Mr.  Ghaleb  returned  to  Yemen  and  sought  assistance  from  the  U.S. \nEmbassy. The U.S. officials in Yemen pressured him to submit to questioning by the FBI \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 13 of 30\nagents. The FBI agents offered to help Mr. Ghaleb if he would work with them. They offered \nto arrange for him to fly back to the United States immediately if he would agree to tell them \nwho the “bad guys” were in Yemen and in San Francisco, and provide names of individuals \nfrom  his  mosque  and  his  community.  Mr.  Ghaleb  declined  to  work  as  a  government \ninformant. When he again attempted to board a flight to the U.S. and was refused boarding, \nan FBI agent again informed him that he would be taken off the No Fly List if he would \nagree to become an FBI informant in the California Yemeni community \n \nThe Redress Process \n \n44. Individuals, even U.S. citizens and LPRs, receive no notice that they have been placed in the \nTSDB or on the No Fly List.  \n45. An individual who has been barred from boarding an aircraft due to apparent placement on \nthe No Fly List has no avenue for redress with the TSC, the government entity responsible \nfor adding individuals to the list, maintaining their inclusion on the list, or removing them \nfrom the list. TSC does not accept redress inquiries directly from the public, nor does it \nprovide final orders or disposition letters to individuals who have submitted redress inquiries. \n46. The only avenue of relief available to individuals who find themselves unable to fly is the \nTRIP program, which is administered by DHS. DHS is responsible for establishing and \nimplementing the redress procedures for individuals who are denied boarding, as well as for \nestablishing  the  administrative  appeals  process  for  redress  determinations.  The  TSA  is \nresponsible for implementing the results of the TRIP process.  \n47. Individuals may submit a DHS TRIP Traveler Inquiry Form by mail, e-mail or by submitting \nan online form. When the inquiry is filed electronically, the system automatically provides a \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 14 of 30\nRedress  Control  Number  to  help  monitor  the  progress  of  the  inquiry  (and  to  serve  as \nadditional identifying information for any future travel). When filing is done via hard-copy, \nthe traveler receives a Redress Control Number at the conclusion of the DHS TRIP review. \n48. If the inquiring individual’s name is an exact or near match to an identity in the TSDB, DHS \nTRIP submits redress inquiries to the TSC, which makes the final decision as to whether any \naction should be taken (including removal from the list). The TSC has provided no public \ninformation about how it makes such decisions, other than to state that TSC “coordinates \nwith” the agency that originally nominated the individual to be included in the TSDB during \nits review of whether the individual should continue to remain in the TSDB. However, the \nTSC is the final arbiter of whether an individual’s name will be retained or removed from the \nlist.  \n49. TSC’s process for making this determination is entirely closed. There is no hearing or other \nfurther opportunity for the complaining individual to participate. Once the TSC makes a final \ndetermination regarding a particular individual’s status on the watch lists, including the No \nFly List, the TSC advises DHS that it has completed its process. DHS TRIP then responds to \nthe individual with a letter that neither confirms nor denies the existence of any terrorist \nwatch list records relating to the individual. The letter does not set forth any basis for \ninclusion  in  a  terrorist  watch  list,  does  not  state  how  the  government  has  resolved  the \ncomplaint at issue, and does not specify whether an individual will be permitted to fly in the \nfuture. Thus, the only “process” available to individuals who are prevented from boarding \ncommercial  flights  is  to  submit  their  names  and  other  identifying  information  to  a \ngovernment entity that has no authority to provide redress and to hope that an unspecified \ngovernment agency corrects an error or changes its mind. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 15 of 30\n50. As a general matter of policy, the government provides no confirmation of whether or not a \nperson is on the No Fly List, at any stage of the nomination or redress processes, even where \npresence on the no Fly List has already been confirmed by individual federal officers or \nairline employees. \nPlaintiff Muhammad Tanvir \n \n51. Plaintiff Muhammad Tanvir is a lawful permanent resident who resides in Queens, New \nYork. He has lived in the United States since 2002 and has been married since March 2, \n2006. \n52. Mr. Tanvir was first questioned by FBI special agents in approximately February 2007 at his \nworkplace, a “99 Cents” store in the Bronx. There, Defendants FBI Special Agent “John” \nTanzin and another FBI agent questioned him about an old acquaintance who they believed \nhad attempted to enter the United States illegally through Mexico. After the FBI agents \nfinished questioning Mr. Tanvir, they asked him if he would be willing to relay information \nto them about the American Muslim community. \n53. Two days later, Mr. Tanvir received a phone call from Agent Tanzin, and again asked if there \nwas anything about the American Muslim community that Mr. Tanvir could share with the \nFBI.  Mr.  Tanvir  replied  that  he  did  not  know  of  anything  that  would  concern  law \nenforcement.   \n54. In 2008, Mr. Tanvir visited his wife and family in Pakistan.  \n55. On his return flight in late 2008, U.S. government officials escorted Mr. Tanvir off the \nairplane, led him to a private investigation room, searched his baggage, and questioned him \nfor five (5) hours before confiscating his passport. The officials ultimately allowed Mr. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 16 of 30\nTanvir to enter the United States, but they held onto Mr. Tanvir’s passport and told him to \npick it up a month later. \n56. Shortly after this trip, FBI agents began aggressively attempting to recruit Mr. Tanvir to work \nfor them as a government informant. \n57. On January 26, 2009, Defendants Tanzin and another FBI agent, Defendant “John Doe” \ncame to see Mr. Tanvir at his workplace, a “99 Cents” store in Queens. The FBI agents asked \nMr. Tanvir to come with them to Manhattan. \n58. Mr. Tanvir agreed to accompany Defendants, and was driven from Queens to the FBI’s New \nYork offices at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. \n59. At 26 Federal Plaza, Defendants informed Mr. Tanvir that they had been following him. \nThey even showed him surveillance photos of himself standing on a New York City subway \nplatform. The FBI agents then told Mr. Tanvir that he was special, hardworking, and that \nthey wanted him to work for them.  \n60. The Defendant FBI agents offered Mr. Tanvir incentives, such as facilitating his wife’s and \nfamily’s visits from Pakistan to the United States and helping his aging parents in Pakistan \ngo on religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. \n61. The FBI agents also threatened Mr. Tanvir by stating that if he did not work for them, they \nwould not give him back his passport and that if he tried to pick up his passport at the airport, \nhe would be deported to Pakistan. \n62. Mr. Tanvir was terrified by the agents’ threats and cried at the meeting. He pleaded with \nthem. He asked them to not deport him because his family depends on him financially.  He \ntold the agents that he believed working as an informant would be dangerous. The Defendant \nFBI agents told him to not repeat their discussion with anyone. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 17 of 30\n63. During that same FBI interview, the FBI agents also asked Mr. Tanvir whether he had \nattended any Taliban training camps, and whether he knew of any training camps near the \nvillage where he was raised. Mr. Tanvir responded that he never attended any training camps \nand didn’t know of the whereabouts of any such camps.  \n64. The next day, Agent Tanzin called Mr. Tanvir and told him that he was authorizing the \nrelease of his passport since Mr. Tanvir was cooperating with the agents.  \n65. On January 28, 2009, Mr. Tanvir picked up his passport from John F. Kennedy airport. Mr. \nTanvir asked the DHS officials why they withheld his passport, and they replied that it was \ndue to an investigation that has since been cleared.  \n66. Two days later, Agent Tanzin informed Mr. Tanvir that DHS was able to return his passport \nbecause he ordered its release. During this call, Agent Tanzin again asked Mr. Tanvir to work \nas an informant for the government.  \n67. Over the course of the next few weeks, Mr. Tanvir received multiple phone calls and visits \nfrom Defendants Tanzin and John Doe at his workplace. The FBI agents repeatedly asked \nMr. Tanvir whether he had decided to work for them as a confidential informant.  \n68. Defendants told Mr. Tanvir that they wanted him to gather information on criminal activities. \nFurther, the agents stated that they were generally interested in people from the “Desi” \n(South Asian) communities. Mr. Tanvir repeatedly told the FBI agents that if he knew of any \ncriminal activities he would tell them but that he did not want to proactively seek out such \ninformation nor spy on any communities generally. \n69. Mr. Tanvir did not want to work as an informant because he felt that it was a dangerous job \nnot only for himself, but for his entire community. He was concerned about the dangers of \nprolonged  and  repeated  interactions  with  federal  government  agents,  and  his  resulting \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 18 of 30\nvulnerability to potential criminal or immigration retaliatory acts. Based on the way the \nagents pressured Mr. Tanvir to tell them about criminal activity that he knew nothing about, \nor even that did not exist, he was also worried that if he agreed to be an informant, he would \nbe required to monitor and potentially entrap innocent individuals in his community. For Mr. \nTanvir, spying and eavesdropping on others, especially when they have done nothing wrong, \nis fundamentally incompatible with his moral and religious beliefs.  \n70. Due to these repeated visits and calls, Mr. Tanvir felt intimidated and harassed. Mr. Tanvir \nspoke to a relative who had been in the United States longer than he had, and was told that he \nwas under no obligation to continue speaking with the FBI agents, and that in fact it would be \nsafer for him not to engage with them. Based on his relative’s advice, he stopped answering \nDefendants’ phone calls. \n71. Eventually, Defendants again visited Mr. Tanvir at his workplace and asked him why he was \nno longer answering their phone calls. Mr. Tanvir explained that he had answered all of their \nquestions on multiple occasions and that he no longer had anything to tell them. The FBI \nagents then asked him to take a polygraph test. When Mr. Tanvir declined to take the test, the \nFBI agents threatened to arrest him. Mr. Tanvir responded that if they arrested him, he would \nobtain an attorney.. After this encounter, Defendants Tanzin and John Doe ceased attempting \nto recruit Mr. Tanvir.  \n72. In January 2010, Mr. Tanvir traveled to Pakistan to visit his wife and parents. During this \ntime, Agent Tanzin visited Mr. Tanvir’s sister at her workplace and questioned her about Mr. \nTanvir’s travel.  \n73. The FBI agents had Mr. Tanvir’s itinerary and wanted to know why Mr. Tanvir had flown on \nKuwait Airways instead of Pakistan International Airlines.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 19 of 30\n74. Mr. Tanvir’s sister replied that Mr. Tanvir had found a cheaper airfare on the Kuwaiti airline. \nShe also told the FBI agents that she was not comfortable speaking with them.  \n75. Mr. Tanvir returned to the United States and took a job as a truck driver, as this work \ngenerated more income even though it required significant travel. \n76. In October 2010, while Mr. Tanvir was in Atlanta for work, he received word that his mother \nwas visiting New York from Pakistan. Mr. Tanvir planned to fly from Atlanta to New York \nCity. When he arrived at the check-in counter at the airport, airline officials told him that he \nwas not allowed to fly. \n77. Two unknown FBI agents approached Mr. Tanvir at the airport and told him to call the New \nYork FBI agents he had originally been in touch with.  \n78. The two unknown FBI agents then drove Mr. Tanvir to the nearby bus station where he could \ntake a New York-bound bus.  \n79. Mr. Tanvir called Defendant Tanzin while waiting at the bus station. However, Agent Tanzin \ntold Mr. Tanvir that he was no longer assigned to his case, but that he should cooperate with \nthe FBI agent who would be contacting him. \n80. Two days after Mr. Tanvir arrived in New York City by bus, Defendant FBI agent Sanya \nGarcia called him and told him that she wanted to speak with him and ask him some more \nquestions.  \n81. Upon information and belief, Agent Garcia knew about Agent Tanzin’s prior failed attempts \nto recruit Mr. Tanvir as an informant, and his subsequent placement of Mr. Tanvir on the No \nFly List in retaliation for his refusal to become an informant. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 20 of 30\n82. Frustrated,  Mr.  Tanvir  told  Agent  Garcia  that  he  had  answered  the  FBI’s  questions  on \nmultiple occasions and that he was not interested in further questioning, and hung up the \nphone. \n83. Almost a year later, Mr. Tanvir reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \nto see whether he would be allowed to board a plane. DHS instructed Mr. Tanvir to file a \nDHS TRIP complaint.  \n84. Mr. Tanvir filed a TRIP complaint on September 27, 2011. \n85. In October 2011, Mr. Tanvir purchased plane tickets to Pakistan for himself and his wife. \nThe date of travel was booked for November 3, 2011. On November 2, 2011, the day before \nMr. Tanvir and his wife were set to fly, Defendant Garcia called Mr. Tanvir.  She told him \nthat he would not be allowed to fly the next day.  \n86. When Mr. Tanvir asked why, Agent Garcia told him that it was because he hung up on her \nthe last time she had tried to question him. \n87. Agent Garcia again demanded that Mr. Tanvir meet with her as a precondition before she \ncould allow him to fly out the following day. Because Mr. Tanvir wanted to fly to visit his \nailing mother, he agreed to meet with her and another FBI agent, Defendant “John LNU,” at \na restaurant.  \n88. At that meeting, Defendants Garcia and Roe subjected Mr. Tanvir to the same questions \nDefendant Tanzin had repeatedly asked on multiple occasions, including questions about his \nfamily, his religious and political beliefs, and whether he had any military training,  \n89. After the meeting, Defendants Garcia and Roe advised Mr. Tanvir that they would try to \npermit him to fly again by obtaining a one-time waiver to enable him to visit his ailing \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 21 of 30\nmother, but that it would take some weeks. As a condition, Mr. Tanvir had to agree to meet \nwith the agents upon his return. \n90. Mr. Tanvir begged Agent Garcia to let him fly the next day with his wife. \n91. Agent Garcia stated that she might be able to do so, but an FBI agent would have to \naccompany him.  \n92. The next day, Agent Garcia called Mr. Tanvir and told him that he would not be permitted to \nfly on that day. She wanted him to come to the FBI headquarters to take a polygraph test. \nWhen Mr. Tanvir’s cousin asked if he could accompany Mr. Tanvir to the polygraph test, \nAgent Garcia refused. \n93. At  that  point,  Mr.  Tanvir  contacted  the  Creating  Law  Enforcement  Accountability  & \nResponsibility (CLEAR) project of Main Street Legal Services, Inc., at CUNY School of \nLaw to represent him in connection with his interactions with the FBI. \n94. Mr. Tanvir’s attorneys reached out to the FBI agents, but the agents did not want to speak to \nhis attorneys. Mr. Tanvir’s attorneys offered to meet with the FBI agents to resolve his \nplacement on the No Fly List, but the agents rejected their proposals. The agents directed the \nattorneys to the FBI legal counsel’s office, which in turn directed them to the TRIP process. \nMr. Tanvir had already tried TRIP and it had not provided him with any redress. \n95. The FBI agents no longer contacted Mr. Tanvir after he obtained legal representation, and no \nlonger sought to recruit him to work as an informant for them. \n96. This confirmed Mr. Tanvir’s suspicion that the FBI had placed him on the No Fly List in \nretaliation for his refusal to work for them as an informant, and as a way to coerce him to \nagree to work as an informant with promises of permanent, or even temporary, removal from \nthe No Fly List.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 22 of 30\n97. On  December  10,  2011,  Mr.  Tanvir  again  attempted  to  visit  his  mother,  whose  health \ncontinued to deteriorate. \n98. At  John  F.  Kennedy  (JFK)  Airport,  Mr.  Tanvir  was  informed  by  the  airline  carrier’s \nemployees that they could not issue him a boarding pass because he was on the No Fly List. \n99. On April 16, 2012, Mr. Tanvir received a response to his TRIP complaint. The letter noted \nthat “no changes or corrections are warranted at this time.” \n100.  On May 17, 2012, Mr Tanvir’s attorneys wrote a letter to the FBI’s legal counsel. The \nletter described Mr. Tanvir’s predicament and the FBI’s retaliatory actions, and it also stated \nthat Mr. Tanvir was prepared to take legal action. Neither Mr. Tanvir nor his attorneys have \nheard back from the FBI in response to that letter. \n101.  On  May  23,  2012,  Mr.  Tanvir  appealed  his  TRIP  determination.  Mr.  Tanvir  also \nrequested the releasable materials upon which the TRIP determination was based.  \n102.  In November 2012, Mr. Tanvir again purchased a ticket to visit his sick mother in \nPakistan. \n103.  On November 28, 2012, Mr. Tanvir arrived at JFK airport and was not allowed to board.  \n104.  An FBI agent who introduced herself as Janet Ambrisco approached Mr. Tanvir and his \nattorney from CLEAR at the check-in area and informed them that in order to be removed \nfrom the No Fly List, Mr. Tanvir would have to meet with Defendant Garcia. \n105.  Mr. Tanvir’s attorney attempted to speak with Agent Garcia but she did not return their \ncalls.  Eventually,  Ms.  Dawn  Bruno  from  the  FBI’s  legal  counsel  office  in  New  York \ninformed Mr. Tanvir’s attorneys that Ms. Garcia was no longer interested in speaking with \nMr. Tanvir. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 23 of 30\n106.  On  March  28,  2013,  Mr.  Tanvir  received  a  letter  from  DHS  which  noted  that  it \nsupersedes the April 16, 2012  TRIP response. The letter stated that Mr. Tanvir’s experience \n“was most likely caused by a misidentification against a government record or by random \nselection,” and that the Government has “made updates” to records. As a result, the letter \nstated, Mr. Tanvir’s request for releasable materials was moot and would not be processed by \nDHS. \n107.   The DHS letter did not state whether Mr. Tanvir had previously been placed on the No \nFly List, whether he had been granted a temporary waiver permitting his travel on a single \noccasion, or whether Mr. Tanvir would be now permitted to board flights. As a result, Mr. \nTanvir purchased another ticket and attempted to travel again. On June 27, 2013, Mr. Tanvir \nwas allowed to board a flight to Pakistan.  \n108.  Mr. Tanvir’s placement on the No Fly List prevented him from visiting his sick mother in \nPakistan, causing him great distress. \n109.  Mr. Tanvir also suffered economic loss because of his placement on the No Fly List, \nincluding but not limited to loss of income and expenses and fees related to the purchase of \nairline tickets.  \n110.  Upon information and belief, Defendants Comey, Piehota, Beers, and Pistole knew about, \nshould have known of, or willfully or recklessly ignored U.S. government agents’ misuse of \nthe No Fly List for purposes other than ensuring aviation safety. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-06951-RA   Document 1    Filed 10/01/13   Page 24 of 30\nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nViolation of the First Amendment: Retaliation \n \n(Against all Defendants) \n \n111.

On appeal from the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiffs’ complaint, we \n12  “accept[] as true factual allegations in the complaint, and draw[] all reasonable \n13  inferences in the favor of the plaintiffs.” Town of Babylon v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, \n14  699 F.3d 221, 227 (2d Cir. 2012).  \n15  I.  Relevant Factual and Procedural Background \n16   \n17    Plaintiffs are Muslim men who reside in New York or Connecticut. Each \n18  was born abroad, immigrated to the United States early in his life, and is now \n19  lawfully present here as either a U.S. citizen or as a permanent resident. Each has \n20  family remaining overseas.  \n5 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg6e o 6f  5o7f 57\n1    Plaintiffs assert that they were each approached by federal agents and \n2  asked to serve as informants for the FBI. Specifically, Plaintiffs were asked to \n3  gather information on members of Muslim communities and report that \n4  information to the FBI.2 In some instances, the FBI’s request was accompanied \n5  with severe pressure, including threats of deportation or arrest; in others, the \n6  request was accompanied by promises of financial and other assistance. \n7  Regardless, Plaintiffs rebuffed those repeated requests, at least in part based on \n8  their sincerely‐held religious beliefs. In response to these refusals, the federal \n9  agents maintained Plaintiffs on the national “No Fly List,” despite the fact that \n10  Plaintiffs “do[] not pose, ha[ve] never posed, and ha[ve] never been accused of \n11  posing, a threat to aviation safety.” App’x at 74, 84, 92 ¶¶ 68, 118, 145.  \n12    According to the complaint, Defendants “forced Plaintiffs into an \n13  impermissible choice between, on the one hand, obeying their sincerely held \n14  religious beliefs and being subjected to the punishment of placement or retention \n                                                            \n2 Plaintiffs assert that they were caught up in a broader web of federal law \nenforcement mistreatment of American Muslims. They allege that, following the \ntragic attacks of September 11, 2001, “the FBI has engaged in widespread \ntargeting of American Muslim communities for surveillance and intelligence‐\ngathering.” App’x at 66 ¶ 36. These law enforcement practices included “the \naggressive recruitment and deployment of informants . . . in American Muslim \ncommunities, organizations, and houses of worship.” Id. \n6 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg7e o 7f  5o7f 57\n1  on the No Fly List, or, on the other hand, violating their sincerely held religious \n2  beliefs in order to avoid being placed on the No Fly List or to secure removal \n3  from the No Fly List.” App’x at 109 ¶ 210. Plaintiffs allege that this dilemma \n4  placed a substantial burden on their exercise of religion.  \n5    Additionally, Defendants’ actions caused Plaintiffs to suffer emotional \n6  distress, reputational harm, and economic loss. As a result of Defendants’ actions \n7  placing and retaining Plaintiffs on the “No Fly List,” Plaintiffs were prohibited \n8  from flying for several years. Such prohibition prevented Plaintiffs from visiting \n9  family members overseas, caused Plaintiffs to lose money they had paid for \n10  plane tickets, and hampered Plaintiffs’ ability to travel for work.3  \n11    A.   The “No Fly List” \n12    In an effort to ensure aircraft security, Congress directed the \n13  Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) to establish procedures for \n14  notifying appropriate officials of the identity of individuals “known to pose, or \n                                                            \n3 One Plaintiff, for example, had to quit a job as a long‐haul trucker because that \njob required him to fly home after completing his route, while another declined \ntemporary employment in Florida due to these travel restrictions. These same \nrestrictions barred another Plaintiff from traveling to Pakistan to visit his ailing \nmother, and rendered yet another Plaintiff unable to see his wife or daughter in \nYemen for many years. \n7 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg8e o 8f  5o7f 57\n1  suspected of posing, a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to airline or \n2  passenger safety.” 49 U.S.C. § 114(h)(2). TSA was further instructed to “utilize all \n3  appropriate records in the consolidated and integrated terrorist watchlist \n4  maintained by the Federal Government” to perform a passenger prescreening \n5  function. 49 U.S.C. § 44903(j)(2)(C)(ii). \n6    The “No Fly List” is one such terrorist watchlist and is part of a broader \n7  database developed and maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (“TSC”), \n8  which is administered by the FBI. The TSC’s database contains information about \n9  individuals who are known or reasonably suspected of being involved in \n10  terrorist activity. The TSC shares the names of individuals on the “No Fly List” \n11  with federal and state law enforcement agencies, the TSA, airline representatives, \n12  and cooperating foreign governments.  \n13    Plaintiffs allege that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies \n14  may “nominate” an individual for inclusion in the TSC’s database, including the \n15  “No Fly List,” if there is “reasonable suspicion” that the person is a “known or \n16  suspected terrorist.” App’x at 68 ¶ 41. In order for a nominated individual to be \n17  added to the “No Fly List,” there must be additional “derogatory information” \n18  showing that the individual “pose[s] a threat of committing a terrorist act with \n8 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1

respect to an aircraft.” App’x at 68 ¶ 42. Any person placed on the “No Fly List” \n2  is barred from boarding a plane that starts in, ends in, or flies over the United \n3  States.4  \n4    Plaintiffs claim that the federal agents named in the amended complaint \n5  “exploited the significant burdens imposed by the No Fly List, its opaque nature \n6  and ill‐defined standards, and its lack of procedural safeguards, in an attempt to \n7  coerce Plaintiffs into serving as informants within their American Muslim \n8  communities and places of worship.” App’x at 59 ¶ 8. When rebuffed, the federal \n9  agents “retaliated against Plaintiffs by placing or retaining them on the No Fly \n10  List.” Id.  \n                                                            \n4 In their amended complaint, Plaintiffs decry the secrecy around the “No Fly \nList,” alleging that there is little public information about its size, the criteria for \ninclusion, the standards for “derogatory information,” or the adequacy of its \nprocedural safeguards. Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs assert that the \n“No Fly List” burgeoned from 3,400 individuals in 2009 to over 21,000 \nindividuals by February 2012.  \n9

As did the district court below, we present Tanvir’s story as illustrative of \n3  Plaintiffs’ experiences. \n4    At the time the complaint was filed, Tanvir was a lawful permanent \n5  resident living in Queens, New York. Tanvir’s wife, son, and parents remain in \n6  Pakistan. In February 2007, Tanvir alleged that FBI Special Agents FNU Tanzin \n7  and John Doe 1 approached him at work and questioned him for 30 minutes \n8  about an acquaintance who allegedly entered the United States illegally. Two \n9  days later, Agent Tanzin called Tanvir and asked whether he had anything he \n10  “could share” with the FBI about the American Muslim community. App’x at 74 \n11  ¶ 70. Tanvir said he told Agent Tanzin that he knew nothing relevant to law \n12  enforcement.  \n13    In July 2008, after returning home from a trip to Pakistan to visit his \n14  family, Tanvir was detained by federal agents for five hours at JFK Airport. His \n15  passport was confiscated and he was told he could retrieve it on January 28, \n16  2009, nearly six months later. Two days prior to that appointment, Agent Tanzin \n17  and FBI Special Agent John Doe 2 visited Tanvir at his new workplace and asked \n18  him to come to the FBI’s Manhattan field office. Tanvir agreed.  \n10 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e1  1o1f  5o7f 57\n1    At the FBI field office, the federal agents questioned Tanvir for about an \n2  hour. The agents asked Tanvir whether he was aware of Taliban training camps \n3  near his home village in Pakistan and whether he had Taliban training. Tanvir \n4  denied knowledge of the camps or participation in such training.  \n5    After the questioning, Agents Tanzin and John Doe 2 complimented \n6  Tanvir and asked him to work as an informant for the FBI in Pakistan or \n7  Afghanistan. Tanvir alleged that they offered him various incentives, including \n8  facilitating visits for his family to the United States and paying for his parents’ \n9  religious pilgrimage. Despite the offer, Tanvir declined, stating that he did not \n10  want to be an informant. The agents persisted, threatening Tanvir that his \n11  passport would not be returned and he would be deported if he failed to \n12  cooperate. Tanvir implored the agents not to deport him. At the meeting’s end, \n13  the agents asked Tanvir to reconsider and to keep their conversation private.  \n14    The next day, Agent Tanzin asked Tanvir if he had reconsidered and \n15  would become an informant. Agent Tanzin threatened Tanvir with deportation if \n16  he did not cooperate. Again, Tanvir declined.  \n17    On January 28, 2009, Tanvir recovered his passport from Department of \n18  Homeland Security (“DHS”) officers at JFK Airport without incident. The DHS \n11 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669,

investigation was complete. Nevertheless, the next day, Agent Tanzin called \n3  Tanvir and said that he asked for the release of Tanvir’s passport because Tanvir \n4  was “cooperative” with the FBI. App’x at 77 ¶ 81. \n5    The FBI agents continued to pressure Tanvir to work as an informant over \n6  the next few weeks. Tanvir received numerous calls and visits at his workplace \n7  from Agents Tanzin and John Doe 1. Tanvir stopped answering their phone calls \n8  and asked them to stop their visits. Later, the agents asked Tanvir to submit to a \n9  polygraph test, and when he declined, they threated to arrest him. When Tanvir \n10  flew to Pakistan in July 2009 to visit his family, Agents Tanzin and John Doe 3 \n11  questioned Tanvir’s sister at her workplace about Tanvir’s travel. \n12    After Tanvir returned to the United States in January 2010, he took a job as \n13  a long‐haul trucker. The job required him to drive across the country and fly \n14  back to New York after he had completed his route.  \n15    In October 2010, Tanvir heard that his mother was visiting New York from \n16  Pakistan. Tanvir, who had been in Atlanta for work, booked a flight back to New \n17  York. When he arrived at the Atlanta airport, an airline employee told Tanvir \n18  that he could not fly. At that time, two FBI agents approached Tanvir and told \n12 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e3  1o3f  5o7f 57\n1  him to call the agents who had previously spoken to him in New York. Tanvir \n2  contacted Agent Tanzin, who instructed that other agents would contact Tanvir \n3  and that he should “cooperate.” App’x at 79 ¶ 92. Unable to fly to New York, \n4  Tanvir traveled by bus—a 24‐hour ride.  \n5    Two days later, FBI Special Agent Sanya Garcia contacted Tanvir. She told \n6  him that if he met with her and answered her questions, she would help remove \n7  his name from the “No Fly List.” Tanvir declined, saying that he had already \n8  answered the FBI’s questions. Because Tanvir believed he could no longer fly, \n9  and therefore could not return to New York after completing his one‐way \n10  deliveries, he quit his job as a long‐haul trucker.  \n11    On September 27, 2011, Tanvir filed a complaint with the DHS Traveler \n12  Redress Inquiry Program (“TRIP”), an administrative mechanism for filing a \n13  complaint about placement on the “No Fly List.”  \n14    The next month, Tanvir purchased tickets to Pakistan for himself and his \n15  wife so that they could visit his ailing mother. The day before his flight, Agent \n16  Garcia told Tanvir that he would not be able to fly unless he met with her and \n17  answered her questions. Because of his urgent need to travel, Tanvir agreed to do \n18  so. After answering the same questions that the other agents asked him \n13 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e4  1o4f  5o7f 57\n1  previously, Tanvir pleaded with Agent Garcia to allow him to fly to Pakistan the \n2  next day. The next day, Agent Garcia told Tanvir that he could not fly. Moreover, \n3  she stated that he could not fly in the future unless he submitted to a polygraph \n4  test. Tanvir cancelled his flight and received only a partial refund. His wife \n5  traveled alone to Pakistan. \n6    After this incident, Tanvir hired counsel. Tanvir’s counsel communicated \n7  with FBI lawyers. The FBI lawyers directed Tanvir’s counsel to the TRIP process, \n8  even though Tanvir had already submitted a TRIP complaint and not yet \n9  received any redress.  \n10    Tanvir persisted, buying another plane ticket to Pakistan to visit his ailing \n11  mother. On December 11, 2011, however, he was denied boarding and told he \n12  was on the “No Fly List.” This was the third time Tanvir was barred from \n13  boarding a flight for which he had purchased a ticket.  \n14    In April 2012, nearly six months after Tanvir filed his complaint with TRIP, \n15  he received a response. The response did not acknowledge that he was on the \n16  “No Fly List,” but noted that “no changes or corrections are warranted at this \n17  time.” App’x at 83 ¶ 110. Tanvir appealed this TRIP determination.  \n14 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e5  1o5f  5o7f 57\n1    In November 2012, Tanvir purchased another ticket to Pakistan in an effort \n2  to visit his ailing mother. Again, Tanvir was denied boarding when he arrived \n3  for his flight. An FBI agent approached Tanvir and his counsel at the airport and \n4  told them that Tanvir would not be removed from the “No Fly List” until he met \n5  with Agent Garcia. \n6    In March 2013, ten months after Tanvir appealed his TRIP determination, \n7  he received a letter from DHS overturning that earlier determination. The letter \n8  blamed Tanvir’s experience on probable “misidentification against a government \n9  record” or “random selection,” and stated that the government “made updates” \n10  to its records. App’x at 83 ¶ 114. Following this communication, Tanvir \n11  purchased a plane ticket to Pakistan for June 2013. On June 27, 2013, Tanvir \n12  successfully boarded a flight to Pakistan. By this time, over five years had passed \n13  since Tanvir was first contacted by the FBI. \n14    Tanvir asserts that because the federal agents wrongfully placed his name \n15  on the “No Fly List,” Tanvir could not fly to visit his family in Pakistan, quit his \n16  trucking job, lost money from unused airline tickets, and feared additional \n17  harassment by the FBI.  \n18   \n15 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e6  1o6f  5o7f 57\n1    C.   Procedural History \n2    On October 1, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting that Defendants \n3  violated their constitutional and statutory rights by placing their names on the \n4  “No Fly List”—even though they posed no threat to aviation safety—in \n5  retaliation for their refusal to become informants for the government. On April \n6  22, 2014, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.  \n7    Plaintiffs sued Defendants in their official capacities under the First \n8  Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n9  §§ 702, 706, and RFRA, 42 U.S.C. § 200bb et seq., seeking injunctive and \n10  declaratory relief. Plaintiffs also sued the federal agents in their individual \n11  capacities, seeking compensatory and punitive damages under the First \n12  Amendment and RFRA.5 \n13    On July 28, 2014, the Defendants filed two separate motions to dismiss the \n14  amended complaint. One motion sought to dismiss Plaintiffs’ official capacity \n15  claims; the other sought to dismiss Plaintiffs’ individual capacity claims.  \n                                                            \n5 Plaintiffs and non‐appealing plaintiff Awais Sajjad asserted a First Amendment \nretaliation claim against all 25 federal agents named as Defendants. Plaintiffs, \nexcluding Sajjad, asserted a claim under RFRA against only the 16 federal agents \nnamed as Defendants that allegedly interacted with Plaintiffs.  \n16 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e7  1o7f  5o7f 57\n1    On June 1, 2015, the government moved to stay Plaintiffs’ official capacity \n2  claims, arguing that it had revised the redress procedures available to challenge \n3  one’s designation on the “No Fly List,” and that Plaintiffs had availed themselves \n4  of those procedures. On June 8, 2015, Plaintiffs received letters from DHS \n5  informing them that the government knows of no reason why they would be \n6  unable to fly. On June 10, 2015, Plaintiffs consented to a stay of their official \n7  capacity claims. The district court stayed those claims and terminated the \n8  government’s related motion to dismiss. The parties continued to dispute \n9  Plaintiffs’ individual capacity claims. \n10    D.   District Court Opinion \n11    On September 3, 2015, the district court issued an opinion and order \n12  dismissing Plaintiffs’ individual capacity claims.  \n13    First, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs’ First Amendment retaliation \n14  claims, stating that the Supreme Court and this Court have “declined to extend \n15  Bivens to a claim sounding in the First Amendment.” Tanvir v. Lynch, 128 F. \n16  Supp.3d 756, 769 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Turkmen v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 218, 236 (2d \n17  Cir. 2015), rev’d in part and vacated and remanded in part sub nom. Ziglar v. Abbasi, \n18  137 S. Ct. 1843 (2017)). Plaintiffs do not appeal that determination here. \n17 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e8  1o8f  5o7f 57\n1    Next, the district court held that RFRA does not permit the recovery of \n2  money damages from federal officers sued in their individual capacities. The \n3  district court determined that “Congress’ intent in enacting RFRA could not be \n4  clearer.” Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 780. Specifically, the court determined that \n5  Congress intended to restore the compelling interest test by which courts \n6  evaluated free exercise claims before the Supreme Court’s decision in \n7  Employment Division, Dept. of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). In \n8  doing so, it held that Congress did not express an intention to expand the \n9  remedies available to those individuals who asserted that their free exercise of \n10  religion was substantially burdened by the government. \n11    The district court found this conclusion supported by the state of the law \n12  at the time RFRA was passed, and RFRA’s legislative history. With respect to the \n13  former, the district court stated that, at the time Smith was decided, the Supreme \n14  Court had not recognized a Bivens remedy for claims under the Free Exercise \n15  Clause, and to allow damages in this case against federal employees would \n16  expand, rather than restore, the remedies available prior to Smith. With respect to \n17  the latter, the district court identified congressional reports stating that Congress \n18  in RFRA did not intend to “expand, contract or alter the ability of a claimant to \n18 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg1e9  1o9f  5o7f 57\n1  obtain relief in a manner consistent” with the Supreme Court’s pre‐Smith free \n2  exercise jurisprudence. Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 778 (quoting S. Rep. No. 103‐111 \n3  at 12). \n4    Finally, the district court rejected Plaintiffs’ assertions with respect to \n5  Franklin v. Gwinnett Cty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60 (1992). In Franklin, the Supreme \n6  Court stated that “we presume the availability of all appropriate remedies unless \n7  Congress has expressly indicated otherwise.” Id. at 66. The district court \n8  nevertheless found that the traditional Franklin presumption did not apply here. \n9  In particular, the district court noted that “Franklin required the Supreme Court \n10  to interpret an implied statutory right of action,” and held that Franklin’s \n11  “ordinary convention” does not control where, as here, Congress created an \n12  express private right of action. Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 779. \n13    Plaintiffs appeal the district court’s ruling that RFRA does not permit the \n14  recovery of money damages from federal officers sued in their individual \n15  capacities.6 We agree with Plaintiffs, and reverse. \n16   \n                                                            \n6 Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their official capacity claims on December 28, \n2015, rendering the district court’s ruling on the individual claims a final \nappealable order.  See Tanvir v. Comey, No. 1:13‐cv‐06951‐RA (docs. 109, 111).  \n19

We review de novo a district court’s dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of \n5  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Town of Babylon, 699 F.3d at 227. When reviewing the \n6  dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim, we accept as true the factual \n7  allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff’s \n8  favor. ATSI Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007). “To \n9  survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \n10

The district court here held that RFRA does not permit a plaintiff to \n13  recover money damages against federal officers sued in their individual \n14  capacities. Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 775. Where, as here, the district court \n15  decision below “presents only a legal issue of statutory interpretation,” “[w]e \n16  review de novo whether the district court correctly interpreted the statute.” White \n17  v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296, 299 (2d Cir. 1993). \n18   \n19   \n20 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm

The district court held that RFRA does not permit the recovery of money \n4  damages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities. To frame our \n5  discussion, we briefly address the difference between official capacity suits and \n6  individual capacity suits. \n7    The Supreme Court has stated that “official‐capacity suits generally \n8  represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an \n9  officer is an agent.” Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991) (citation and internal \n10  quotation marks omitted). In an official capacity suit, “the real party in interest \n11  … is the governmental entity and not the named official.” Id. By contrast, \n12  individual capacity suits “seek to impose individual liability upon a government \n13  officer for [her] actions under color of [] law.” Id. Any damages awarded in an \n14  individual capacity suit “will not be payable from the public fisc but rather will \n15  come from the pocket of the individual defendant.” Blackburn v. Goodwin, 608 \n16  F.2d 919, 923 (2d Cir. 1979).7 \n                                                            \n7 Suits against public officers that seek damages are directed at the particular \nofficer whose allegedly unlawful actions are claimed to have caused damage to \nplaintiffs.  In contrast, suits against officers in their official capacity, which \ngenerally seek injunctive relief, are directed at the office itself. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n21 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg2e2  2o2f  5o7f 57\n1    This distinction proves important with respect to the recovery of damages. \n2  “Absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its \n3  agencies from suit.” Dep’t of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 260 (1999) \n4  (citation omitted). Sovereign immunity does not, however, shield federal officials \n5  sued in their individual capacities. Lewis v. Clarke, 137 S. Ct. 1285, 1291 (2017) \n6  (“[S]overeign immunity does not erect a barrier against suits to impose \n7  individual and personal liability.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n8  III. Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n9    “As in any case of statutory construction, we start our analysis . . . with the \n10  language of the statute.” Chai v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue, 851 F.3d 190, 217 (2d \n11  Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). “Where the statutory language provides a clear \n12  answer, our analysis ends there.” Id. (citation and internal punctuation omitted). \n13  “[I]f the meaning of the statute is ambiguous, we may resort to canons of \n14  statutory interpretation to help resolve the ambiguity.” Id. (citation and brackets \n15  omitted). “The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by \n16  reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \n17(d). As a result, if the defendant in an official capacity suit leaves office, the \nsuccessor to the office replaces the originally named defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. \nR. 25(d). \n22

Statutory Text \n4   \n5    In 1993, Congress passed RFRA. 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, et seq. Congress stated \n6  that its purposes in enacting RFRA were “to restore the compelling interest test” \n7  that been applied in cases where free exercise of religion was substantially \n8  burdened and “to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise \n9  is substantially burdened by government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb(b). Through \n10  RFRA, Congress sought “to provide very broad protection for religious liberty.” \n11  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 2751, 2760 (2014).   \n12    RFRA provides that the “Government shall not substantially burden a \n13

the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental \n16  interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \n17  governmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb‐1(a), (b). \n18    In order to protect this statutory right, RFRA created an explicit private \n19  right of action. Id. § 2000bb‐1(c). That section permits any “person whose \n23 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P

violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate \n3  relief against a government.” Id. § 2000bb‐1(c) (emphasis added). RFRA defines the \n4  term “government,” to include “a branch, department, agency, instrumentality, \n5  and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States.” Id. § \n6  2000bb‐2(1). RFRA does not define the term “appropriate relief.” \n7    In its decision below, the district court determined that the phrase \n8  “appropriate relief” did not include money damages from federal officials sued \n9  in their individual capacities. See Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 775. The district court \n10  did not address whether federal officers sued in their individual capacities are \n11  included within RFRA’s definition of “government” and therefore amenable to \n12  suit under RFRA. See id. at 774 n. 17. \n13  B.  “Against a Government” \n14   \n15    On appeal, the parties disagree over whether RFRA authorizes individual \n16  capacity suits against government officials. In construing the meaning of the \n17  term “government” under RFRA, we begin by reviewing RFRA’s plain language. \n18  See Chai, 851 F.3d at 217. Because RFRA’s plain language “provides a clear \n24 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg2e5  2o5f  5o7f 57\n1  answer,” we conclude that RFRA authorizes individual capacity claims against \n2  federal officers. Id. \n3    As discussed above, RFRA permits a plaintiff to assert a violation of the \n4  statute “as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain relief against a \n5  government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb‐1(c). RFRA defines “government” to include “a \n6  branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting \n7  under color of law) of the United States.” Id. § 2000bb‐2(1). When we substitute \n8  that definition for the defined term, it is clear that a plaintiff may bring a claim \n9  for “appropriate relief against” either a federal “official” or “other person acting \n10  under color of [federal] law” whose actions substantially burden the plaintiff’s \n11  religious exercise. Therefore, RFRA, by its plain terms, authorizes individual \n12  capacity suits against federal officers.  \n13    Defendants argue, to the contrary, that the plain text of RFRA permits suits \n14  only against officers in their official capacities and not suits against federal \n15  officers in their individual capacities. Defendants argue that we: (1) should give \n16  the term “government” its most natural reading; (2) should understand the \n17  phrase “official” in the statutory definition of “government” as suggesting that \n18  only official capacity suits are permitted; and (3) should conclude that the phrase \n25 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg2e6  2o6f  5o7f 57\n1  “or other person acting under color of law” is not intended to permit \n2  government officers to be sued in their individual capacities. We disagree with \n3  each argument.  \n4    First, we refuse Defendants’ request to apply a natural reading of the term \n5  “government” in this case where RFRA includes an explicit definition of \n6  “government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb‐2(1). “When a statute includes an explicit \n7  definition, we must follow that definition.” Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 942 \n8  (2000); Upstate Citizens for Equality, Inc. v. United States, 841 F.3d 556, 575 (2d Cir. \n9  2016) (“In general, statutory definitions control the meaning of statutory \n10  words.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the statute specifically \n11  defines ʹgovernmentʹ to include officials and others acting under color of law. \n12  There would be no need to permit suits against government agents in their \n13  official capacity, since such a suit is simply a formal variant of an action that, in \n14  substance, runs against the government itself. See Hafer, 502 U.S. at 25. \n15    Second, RFRA’s use of the word “official” in the statutory definition of \n16  “government” does not mandate that a plaintiff may only obtain relief against \n17  federal officers in official capacity suits. In ordinary usage, an “official” is \n18  generally defined simply as “one who holds or is invested with an office” and is \n26 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg2e7  2o7f  5o7f 57\n1  roughly synonymous with the term “officer.” Merriam‐Webster Unabridged, \n2  http:/unabridged.merriam‐webster.com/unabridged/official (noun definition). \n3  There is no reason to think that, in using this ordinary English word, Congress \n4  intended to invoke the technical legal concept of “official capacity,” rather than \n5  simply to state that government “officials” are amenable to suit. Moreover, the \n6  statute permits suits against “officials (or other person[s] acting under color of \n7  law).” 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000bb‐2(1). The specific authorization of actions broadly \n8  against “other person[s] acting under color of law,” undercuts the assertion that \n9  the term “official”’ was intended to limit the scope of available actions.  \n10    Further, a defendant’s status as a federal officer “is not controlling” in \n11  determining whether a suit is, in reality, against the government. Stafford v. \n12  Briggs, 444 U.S. 527, 542 n. 10 (1980) (citation omitted). Rather, “the dispositive \n13  inquiry is ‘who will pay the judgment?’” Id. A plaintiff may not sue a federal \n14  officer in her official capacity for money damages, because such suit seeks money \n15  from the federal government, and sovereign immunity would bar recovery from \n16  the federal government absent an explicit waiver. However, a plaintiff may sue a \n17  federal officer in her individual capacity without implicating sovereign \n27 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg2e8  2o8f  5o7f 57\n1  immunity concerns. See Hafer, 502 U.S. at 25‐28. RFRA’s use of the word “official” \n2  does not alter that rule.  \n3    Third, we reject Defendants’ argument that the phrase “other person \n4  acting under color of law” authorizes only official capacity suits. Rather, that \n5  phrase “contemplates that persons ‘other’ than ‘officials’ may be sued under \n6  RFRA, and persons who are not officials may be sued only in their individual \n7  capacities.” Patel v. Bureau of Prisons, 125 F. Supp.3d 44, 50 (D.D.C. 2015) (citing \n8  Jama v. INS, 343 F. Supp.2d 338, 374 (D. N.J. 2004)) (emphasis added). \n9  “Defendants’ interpretation would render the entire phrase surplasage: once \n10  Congress authorized official‐capacity suits against ‘officials,’ adding another \n11  term that allowed only official‐capacity suits would have had no effect \n12  whatsoever.” Id.  \n13    Our conclusion that RFRA authorizes individual capacity claims against \n14  federal officers is consistent with the Supreme Court’s recognition of RFRA’s \n15  “[s]weeping coverage,” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 532 (1997), which \n16  “was designed to provide very broad protection for religious liberty,” Hobby \n17  Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2767. RFRA’s reach “ensures its intrusion at every level of \n18  government, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every \n28 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg2e9  2o9f  5o7f 57\n1  description and regardless of subject matter.” City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532 \n2  (further stating that RFRA’s restrictions “apply to every agency and official of the \n3  Federal … Government[]”). \n4    Moreover, we draw support for our conclusion from Congress’s use of \n5  comparable language in enacting 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which, long prior to RFRA’s \n6  enactment, had consistently been held to authorize individual and official \n7  capacity suits. See, e.g., Hafer, 502 U.S. at 25; Graham, 473 U.S. at \n8  166. Section 1983 creates a private right of action against “persons” who, acting \n9  “under color of [law],” violate a plaintiff’s constitutional rights—regardless of \n10  whether that person was acting pursuant to an unconstitutional state law, \n11  regulation, or policy. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n12    We, like several of our sister circuits before us, do not find “this word \n13  choice [] coincidental,” as “Congress intended for courts to borrow concepts from \n14  § 1983 when construing RFRA.” Mack v. Warden Loretto FCI, 839 F.3d 286, 302 (3d \n15  Cir. 2016); see also Listecki v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors, 780 F.3d 731, 738 \n16

already judicially interpreted phrase from an old statute to use it in a new \n29 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg3e0  3o0f  5o7f 57\n1  statute, it is presumed that the legislature intends to adopt not merely the old \n2  phrase but the judicial construction of that phrase.” Sutton, 192 F.3d at 834‐35 \n3  (citation omitted); Mack, 839 F.3d at 302 (quoting same); see also Leonard v. Israel \n4  Discovery Bank, 199 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[R]epetition of the same language \n5  in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its  \n6  judicial interpretations as well.”) (citation and ellipses omitted).  \n7    In light of this presumption, given both RFRA’s and Section 1983’s \n8  applicability to “person[s]” acting “under color of law,” we hold that RFRA, like \n9  Section 1983, authorizes a plaintiff to bring individual capacity claims against \n10  federal officials or other “person[s] acting under color of [federal] law.”  \n11  C.  “Appropriate Relief” \n12     \n13    Having determined that RFRA permits individual capacity suits against \n14  government officers acting under color of law, we now turn to whether \n15  “appropriate relief” in that context includes money damages. In its opinion \n16  below, the district court held that “appropriate relief” did not include money \n17  damages in suits against federal officers in their individual capacities. Tanvir, 128 \n18  F. Supp.3d at 780‐81. We disagree. \n19   \n30 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot

Ambiguity and the Franklin Presumption \n2   \n3    Starting with RFRA’s statutory text, as we do in any case of statutory \n4  construction, we note that RFRA does not define the phrase “appropriate relief.” \n5  See Chai, 851 F.3d at 217. Unable to draw further insight from a plain reading of \n6  the statute, we turn to the context in which the language is used and the context \n7  of the statute more broadly. See Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341.   \n8    In the context of RFRA’s companion statute, the Religious Land Use and \n9  Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq., 8 the \n10  Supreme Court acknowledged that the phrase “‘appropriate relief’ is open‐ended \n11  and ambiguous about what types of relief it includes . . . Far from clearly \n12  identifying money damages, the word ‘appropriate’ is inherently context‐\n13  dependent.” Sossamon, 563 U.S. at 286. Indeed, “[i]n some contexts, ‘appropriate \n                                                            \n8 The district court opinion aptly notes that RFRA and RLUIPA are companion \nstatutes. See Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 775. After the Supreme Court in City of \nBoerne, 521 U.S. 507, determined that RFRA was unconstitutional as applied to \nstate and local governments because it exceeded Congress’s power under Section \n5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress passed RLUIPA pursuant to the \nSpending Clause and Commerce Clause. See Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 775 n. 18; \nSossamon v. Texas, 563 U.S. 277, 281 (2011). “RLUIPA borrows important elements \nfrom RFRA . . . includ[ing] an express private cause of action that is taken from \nRFRA.” Sossamon, 563 U.S. at 281. As a result, courts commonly apply RFRA case \nlaw to issues arising under RLUIPA and vice versa. See Redd v. Wright, 597 F.3d \n532, 535 n. 2 (2d Cir. 2010). \n31

‘appropriate relief’ covers equitable relief but not damages.” Id. As with the \n4  analogous phrase in RLUIPA, we agree that the phrase “appropriate relief” in \n5  RFRA’s statutory text is ambiguous. \n6    Having made that determination, “we resort to canons of statutory \n7  interpretation to help resolve the ambiguity.” Chai, 851 F.3d at 217. We turn to \n8

indicated otherwise.” Id. at 65‐66 (emphasis added); see also Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. \n7  247, 255 (1978) (upholding damages remedy under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, even though \n8  the enacting Congress did not “address directly the question of damages”). It \n9  based that presumption on a long‐standing rule that “has deep roots in our \n10  jurisprudence:” that “[w]here legal rights have been invaded, and a federal \n11  statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may \n12

government,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb‐1(c), and includes no “express[] indicat[ion]” \n18  that it proscribes the recovery of money damages, Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66. \n33 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1

RFRA’s explicit private right of action. In light of RFRA’s purpose to provide \n5  broad protections for religious liberty, Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2760, and \n6  applying the Franklin presumption here, we hold that RFRA authorizes the \n7  recovery of money damages against federal officers sued in their individual \n8  capacities.9 \n9  b.  Defendants’ Arguments to the Contrary  \n10   \n11  i.  Precedent Does Not Require a Different Outcome \n12   \n13    Defendants argue that our holding here is inconsistent with several \n14  decisions by the Supreme Court, our Court, and our sister circuits limiting the \n                                                            \n9 Indeed, the determination that RFRA permits individual capacity suits leads \nlogically to the conclusion that it permits a damages remedy against those \nindividuals. An individual capacity suit that is confined to injunctive relief has \nlimited value; official capacity suits for injunctive relief already supply injunctive \nrelief against the governmental entity as a whole. As a result, plaintiffs will \nrarely, if ever, prefer to enjoin the conduct of a single officer. In contrast, as noted \nabove, suits seeking compensation from officers in their official capacity, being in \nessence suits against the state or federal government itself, are generally barred \nby sovereign immunity. Thus, individual capacity suits tend to be associated \nwith damages remedies, and official capacity suits with injunctive relief.  \n34

at 1026; Oklevueha Native Am. Church of Hawaii, Inc. v. Holder, 676 F.3d 829, 840‐41 \n4  (9th Cir. 2012); Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198, 1210 (11th Cir. 2015), cert. denied \n5  sub nom. Davila v. Haynes, 136 S.Ct. 78 (2015). Our holding, however, is not \n6  inconsistent with these decisions, each of which is based upon animating \n7  principles that are inapplicable here.  \n8    In Sossamon, the Supreme Court held that the phrase “appropriate relief” \n9  in RLUIPA does not permit the recovery of money damages against a state or \n10  state officers sued in their official capacities. 563 U.S. at 288. The Supreme Court \n11  based its conclusion on considerations relating to state sovereign immunity. \n12  Namely, when determining whether an act of Congress waives sovereign \n13  immunity, the Court stated that such language “will be strictly construed, in \n14  terms of scope, in favor of the sovereign.” Id. at 285. Therefore, in that context, \n15  the Court’s relevant inquiry was the opposite of the one at issue here: “not \n16  whether Congress has given clear direction that it intends to exclude a damages \n17  remedy, see Franklin, [503 U.S.] at 70‐71, but whether Congress ha[d] given clear \n18  direction that it intend[ed] to include a damages remedy.” Sossamon, 563 U.S. at \n35 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg3e6  3o6f  5o7f 57\n1  289 (emphasis in original). Because the phrase “appropriate relief” in that context \n2  did not “unequivocally express[]” Congress’s intent to waive state sovereign \n3  immunity, the Supreme Court held that RLUIPA did not permit a suit for \n4  monetary damages against a state or state officials sued in their official \n5  capacities. Id. at 288. \n6    Like Sossamon, several of our sister circuits have determined that RFRA’s \n7  prescription for “appropriate relief” does not include damages against the \n8  federal government or its officers acting in their official capacities. See Webman, \n9  441 F.3d at 1026; Oklevueha Native Am. Church of Hawaii, 676 F.3d at 840‐41; Davila \n10  777 F.3d at 1210. These courts so held because, in the context of suits against the \n11  federal government and its officers in their official capacities, the phrase \n12  “appropriate relief” similarly does not express an unambiguous waiver of the \n13  federal government’s sovereign immunity. See, e.g., Davila, 777 F.3d at 1210 \n14  (“Congress did not unequivocally waive its sovereign immunity in passing \n15  RFRA. RFRA does not therefore authorize suits for money damages against \n16  officers in their official capacities.”). \n17    The animating principles underlying Sossamon, Webman, Oklevueha Native \n18  Am. Church of Hawaii, and Davila, however, are absent from the instant case. Each \n36 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg3e7  3o7f  5o7f 57\n1  of those cases involved a question of whether “appropriate relief” under RFRA \n2  or RLUIPA permitted suits against a sovereign or its officers in their official \n3  capacities. Although the Supreme Court and our sister circuits declined to \n4  construe the phrase “appropriate relief” to amount to an explicit waiver of \n5  sovereign immunity, Plaintiffs’ individual capacity suits against Defendants \n6  present no sovereign immunity concerns here. This is so because Plaintiffs seek \n7  monetary relief from those officers personally, not from the federal or state \n8  government. See Hafer, 502 U.S. at 25‐28; Blackburn, 608 F.2d at 923. As we stated \n9  above, “Congress need not waive sovereign immunity to permit an individual‐\n10  capacity suit against a federal official.” Patel, 125 F. Supp.3d at 54 (citing Larson, \n11  337 U.S. at 686‐87).  \n12    Indeed, as the district court below acknowledged in its discussion of \n13  precedent, “[b]ecause these decisions . . . are grounded in principles of sovereign \n14  immunity, they are of limited assistance in addressing the question of damages \n15  against those who ‘come to court as individuals.’” Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 775 \n16  n. 19 (quoting Hafer, 502 U.S. at 27). We agree and similarly find those cases \n17  inapplicable here where sovereign immunity concerns are not at play. \n37 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg3e8  3o8f  5o7f 57\n1     Furthermore, our holding that RFRA permits the recovery of money \n2  damages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities does not \n3  conflict with our decision in Washington v. Gonyea. In Gonyea, we held that the \n4  phrase “appropriate relief” in RLUIPA prohibits both the recovery of money \n5  damages from state officers sued in their official capacities and in their individual \n6  capacities. Gonyea, 731 F.3d at 145. The conclusion that RLUIPA does not permit \n7  the recovery of money damages from state officers sued in their official capacities \n8  follows directly from the Supreme Court’s decision in Sossamon. 563 U.S. at 293 \n9  (“States, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign \n10  immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA because no statute \n11  expressly and unequivocally includes such a waiver.”).  \n12    Gonyea’s conclusion that RLUIPA does not permit the recovery of money \n13  damages from state officers sued in their individual capacities follows from \n14  another source: the constitutional basis upon which Congress relied in enacting \n15  RLUIPA. RLUIPA “was enacted pursuant to Congress’ spending power, which \n16  allows the imposition of conditions, such as individual liability, only on those \n17  parties actually receiving state funds.” 731 F.3d at 145 (citation omitted). \n18

aPgaeg3e9  3o9f  5o7f 57\n1  entities other than the recipients of the federal funds at issue would have the \n2  effect of binding non‐parties to the terms of the spending contract.” Patel, 125 F. \n3  Supp.3d at 52 (internal quotation marks omitted). “Indeed, to decide otherwise \n4  would create liability on the basis of a law never enacted by a sovereign with the \n5  power to affect the individual rights at issue—i.e., the state receiving the federal \n6  funds—and this would raise serious questions regarding whether Congress had \n7  exceeded its authority under the Spending Clause.” Gonyea, 731 F.3d at 146 \n8  (emphasis in original; citations and internal punctuation omitted). As a result, in \n9  Gonyea, we held that RLUIPA did not permit a plaintiff to sue state officials in \n10  their individual capacities because the state prison, and not the state prison \n11  officials, was the ‘contracting party,’ which had “agree[d] to be amenable to suit \n12  as a condition to received funds.” Id. at 145. \n13    RFRA, by contrast, was enacted pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth \n14  Amendment and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Hankins v. Lyght, 441 F.3d 96, \n15  105 (2d Cir. 2006). RFRA’s constitutional bases thus “do[] not implicate the same \n16  concerns” as those relevant to RLUIPA and the Spending Clause, which we \n17  addressed in Gonyea. Mack, 839 F.3d at 303‐04; see also Tanvir, 128 F. Supp. 3d at \n18  775 n. 19. Because the animating principles underlying our decision in Gonyea are \n39 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e0  4o0f  5o7f 57\n1  absent in the instant case, our holding here—that RFRA permits the recovery of \n2  money damages from federal officials sued in their individual capacities—and \n3  our holding in Gonyea—that RLUIPA does not permit the recovery of money \n4  damages from state officials sued in their individual capacities—are entirely \n5  consistent. \n6    Defendants complain that our holding in this case makes the phrase \n7  “appropriate relief” in RFRA into a chameleon. See United States v. Santos, 553 \n8  U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (plurality op.) (stating that the Supreme Court has “forcefully \n9  rejected” the “interpretive contortion” of “giving the same word, in the same \n10  statutory provision, different meanings in different factual contexts”) (emphasis \n11  omitted). But that is incorrect. To the contrary, we are tasked with interpreting \n12  the meaning of RFRA’s phrase “appropriate relief,” an inquiry that is “inherently \n13  context‐dependent.” Sossamon, 563 U.S. at 286. Indeed, the word ‘appropriate’ \n14  does not change its meaning; rather, the question addressed in each of these \n15  various contexts is what sort of relief is ‘appropriate’ in that particular situation. \n16  And, since the relevant animating principles vary appreciably across legal \n17  contexts, the meaning of ‘appropriate’ may well take on different meanings in \n18  different settings.  \n40 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e1  4o1f  5o7f 57\n1    At the time of the district court decision below, neither the Supreme Court \n2  nor any of our sister circuits had squarely addressed whether RFRA provides for \n3  money damages.10 Since then, however, the Third Circuit has held, as we do \n4  now, that RFRA authorizes individual capacity suits against federal officers for \n5  money damages. See Mack, 839 F.3d at 304.   \n6    In Mack, the Third Circuit reached that holding by applying the Franklin \n7  presumption—that any “appropriate relief” is available unless Congress \n8  expressly indicates otherwise. Id. at 302‐03. The court found that its conclusion \n9  was buttressed by the fact that, in enacting RFRA, Congress used the exact \n10  language (“appropriate relief”) discussed by the Supreme Court in Franklin. Id. at \n11  303. “Congress enacted RFRA one year after Franklin was decided and was \n12  therefore well aware that ‘appropriate relief’ means what it says, and that, \n                                                            \n10 The Seventh Circuit has previously decided that a plaintiff was entitled to sue \nstate prison officials in their individual capacities for damages. Mack v. O’Leary, \n80 F.3d 1175, 1177 (7th Cir. 1996) (Posner, J.), vacated on other grounds, 522 U.S. 801 \n(1997). Before reaching that conclusion, the court noted that RFRA “says nothing \nabout remedies except that a person whose rights under the Act are violated \n‘may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and \nobtain appropriate relief against a government.’” Id. (emphasis in original) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb‐1(c)). The court also acknowledged that the \ndefendants in that case did not contest the availability of damages as a remedy \nunder RFRA. Id.    \n41 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e2  4o2f  5o7f 57\n1  without expressly stating otherwise, all appropriate relief would be available.” \n2  Id. at 303.11 In light of RFRA’s purpose of providing broad religious liberty \n3  protections, the Third Circuit concluded that it saw “no reason why a suit for \n4  money damages against a government official whose conduct violates RFRA \n5  would be inconsistent with” that purpose. Id.12  \n6    We agree with the Third Circuit’s reasoning in Mack and adopt it here. In \n7  particular, we reject a strained reading of “appropriate relief” that would be less \n8  generous to plaintiffs under RFRA than under implied rights of action, and thus \n9  would undermine Congress’s intention to “provide broad religious liberty \n10  protections.” Id.  Further, as one district court has pointed out, “[i]t seems \n                                                            \n11 Of note, the Third Circuit in Mack stated that “[b]ecause Mack brings his RFRA \nclaim against only [two federal officers] in their individual capacities, the federal \ngovernment’s sovereign immunity to suits for damages is irrelevant here.” Id. at \n302 n. 92.   \n12 The court in Mack drew further support from the similarities between RFRA \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which has long permitted money damages against state \nofficials sued in their individual capacities. Id. By comparison, the court \ndistinguished its earlier decision in Sharp v. Johnson, 669 F.3d 144, 154‐55 (3d Cir. \n2012), in which it found that RLUIPA did not provide for money damages \nagainst state officials sued in their individual capacities, by pointing out how \nCongress’s constitutional authorization for RLUIPA (Commerce Clause and \nSpending Clause) poses concerns not relevant to its analysis of RFRA (Necessary \nand Proper Clause and Section 5 of Fourteenth Amendment). \n \n42 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e3  4o3f  5o7f 57\n1  unlikely that Congress would restrict the kind of remedies available to plaintiffs \n2  who challenge free exercise violations in the same statute it passed to elevate the \n3  kind of scrutiny to which such challenges would be entitled.” Jama, 343 F. Supp.2d \n4  at 374‐75 (emphasis in original). Given that Congress has not specified that \n5  individual capacity suits for money damages should be barred under RFRA, and \n6  that, unlike in the RLIUPA context, no constitutional conflict prevents their \n7  application, we find that such suits are wholly appropriate under this statutory \n8  scheme.   \n9  ii.  The Franklin Presumption Is Not Confined to Statutes with \n10  Implied Rights of Action \n11   \n12    The district court below found that the Franklin presumption did not apply \n13  in the instant case. Tanvir, 128 F. Supp.3d at 779. In making that determination, \n14  the district court noted that Franklin “required the Supreme Court to interpret the \n15  scope of an implied statutory right of action.” Id. (emphasis in original). By \n16  comparison, Congress created an express private right of action in RFRA. See 42 \n17  U.S.C. § 2000bb‐1(c). The district court held that “the Franklin presumption is \n18  thus inapplicable” to RFRA “and the meaning of ‘appropriate relief’ must be \n19  discerned using the traditional tools of statutory construction.” Tanvir, 128 F. \n43 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e4  4o4f  5o7f 57\n1  Supp.3d at 779. Applying those tools, the district court discerned that Congress \n2  lacked an intent to permit money damages under RFRA through its use of the \n3  phrase “appropriate relief.” Id.   \n4    Although Franklin indeed considered the availability of damages under a \n5  statute with an implied private right of action, we are not convinced that the \n6  district court’s distinction is correct.  The logical inference, in our view, runs the \n7  other way: one would expect a court to be more cautious about expanding the \n8  scope of remedies available for a private right of action that is not explicitly \n9  provided by Congress, than in determining what remedies are available for a \n10  right of action that Congress has expressly created. This is particularly true \n11  where, in creating the right of action, Congress has also explicitly authorized \n12  courts to provide any “appropriate relief,” without limitation. In fact, the Court \n13  in Franklin recounted its own case, Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, in which \n14  it held that damages were available under a statute with an explicit private right \n15  of action where that statute failed to specify the remedies available. 37 U.S. (12 \n16  Pet) 524, 624 (1838) (stating that to find otherwise would present “a monstrous \n17  absurdity in a well organized government, that there should be no remedy, \n18  although a clear and undeniable right should be shown to exist”).   \n44 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e5  4o5f  5o7f 57\n1    As discussed above, the Third Circuit in Mack applied the Franklin \n2  presumption in determining that RFRA’s express private right of action \n3  permitted the recovery of money damages against individuals sued in their \n4  individual capacities. Mack, 839 F.3d at 303‐04; see also Patel, 125 F. Supp.3d at 53 \n5  n. 1 (“[T]he mere mention of remedies [in RFRA] does not rebut the [Franklin] \n6  presumption;” rather, the phrase “appropriate relief” “does nothing more than \n7  authorize what courts applying Franklin presume, and it falls far short of an \n8  express indication that damages are prohibited.”) (internal punctuation omitted). \n9  Other courts have applied the Franklin presumption in the context of statutes \n10  containing express private rights of action. See, e.g., Reich v. Cambridgeport Air. \n11  Sys., 26 F.3d 1187, 1191 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying Franklin presumption to \n12  conclude that “all appropriate relief” under Section 11 of the Occupational Safety \n13  and Health Act included money damages); Ditulio v. Boehm, 662 F.3d 1091, 1098 \n14  (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that punitive damages were available under the \n15  Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which permits the recovery of “damages,” \n16  because the court “follow[s] the ‘general rule’ that we should award ‘any \n17  appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal \n18  statute’” (quoting Franklin, 503 U.S. at 71)). \n45 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e6  4o6f  5o7f 57\n1    We disagree with the district court’s decision to limit the application of the \n2  Franklin presumption in this case. The Franklin presumption need not be confined \n3  to only those cases interpreting the remedies available under an implied private \n4  right of action. To the contrary, “[t]he same presumption applies here—more so, \n5  we think, because Congress expressly stated that a claimant may obtain \n6  ‘appropriate relief’ against a government—the exact language used in Franklin.” \n7  Mack, 839 F.3d at 303. Thus, we reject the district court’s position that the Franklin \n8  presumption does not apply in interpreting the meaning of “appropriate relief” \n9  under RFRA.  \n10  iii.  Legislative History \n11    Although we conclude that the Franklin presumption extends to express \n12  private rights of action, the presumption can be rebutted. Pursuant to Franklin, \n13  “we presume the availability of all appropriate remedies unless Congress has \n14  expressly indicated otherwise,” 503 U.S. at 66, and our analysis of whether \n15  Congress intended to limit the application of this general principle will vary \n16  depending on whether the right of action is implied or explicit.  \n17    Where a statutory cause of action is implied, it is futile to resort to the \n18  statutory text and legislative history, because Congress usually has not spoken \n46 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e7  4o7f  5o7f 57\n1  about remedies applicable to a right that the federal courts, rather than Congress, \n2  created. See id. at 71 (“[T]he usual recourse to statutory text and legislative \n3  history. . . necessarily will not enlighten our analysis.”). Accordingly, our \n4  analysis of Congress’s intent in such contexts “is not basically a matter of \n5  statutory construction,” but rather a matter of “evaluat[ing] the state of the law \n6  when the Legislature passed [the statute].” Id. (emphasis in original). \n7    On the other hand, where the private right of action is express, the \n8  statutory text and legislative history may enlighten our understanding. The \n9  question thus becomes whether these interpretative sources exhibit a “clear \n10  direction” by Congress that the federal courts lack “the power to award any \n11  appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a \n12  federal statute.” Id. at 70‐71. We conclude that neither the statutory text nor the \n13  legislative history provides such a clear direction here. \n14    As noted above, the district court supported its conclusion in part by \n15  referencing legislative history indicating that RFRA was intended solely to \n16  reverse the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith. See Tanvir, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 778‐\n17  80. For instance, the Senate Committee Report, which discusses the background \n18  and purpose for RFRA, states that “the purpose of this act is only to overturn the \n47 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e8  4o8f  5o7f 57\n1  Supreme Court’s decision in Smith,” S. Rep. No. 103‐111, at 12 (1993), and by \n2  doing so restore the compelling interest test to free exercise claims, id. at 8. The \n3  House Committee Report similarly focuses on the effect of the Smith decision and \n4  the resulting outcome that free exercise claims receive the “the lowest level of \n5  scrutiny employed by the courts.” H.R. Rep. No. 103‐88, at 5‐6 (1993). \n6    The Senate and House Committee Reports, however, are not conclusive as \n7  to the meaning of RFRA’s statutory text. The statutory text of RFRA reflects a \n8  dual purpose: “to restore the compelling interest test” applied by the Supreme \n9  Court in free exercise cases before Smith, and “to provide a claim or defense to \n10  persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.” 42 \n11  U.S.C. § 2000bb(b). In accomplishing the latter purpose, Congress also codified a \n12  statutory cause of action to bring claims against officials in their individual \n13  capacities—a type of action never explicitly authorized (or foreclosed) by the \n14  Supreme Court’s free exercise jurisprudence. Congress accordingly went beyond \n15  merely restoring the compelling interest test. It removed ambiguity about who \n16  could be held liable for violations of religious exercise.13   \n                                                            \n13 The Supreme Court also has indicated that RFRA’s least restrictive means \nrequirement may well have gone beyond what was required by its pre‐Smith \n48 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg4e9  4o9f  5o7f 57\n1    The legislative history further fails to provide an “express[]” and “clear \n2  direction” that Congress intended to preclude litigants from seeking damages in \n3  these individual capacity suits. Franklin, 503 U.S. at 66, 70. To be sure, the House \n4  and Senate Committee Reports each contain similar language stating, “[t]o be \n5  absolutely clear, the bill does not expand, contract or alter the ability of a \n6  claimant to obtain relief in a manner consistent with free exercise jurisprudence, \n7  including Supreme Court jurisprudence, under the compelling governmental \n8  interest test prior to Smith.” H.R. Rep. No. 103‐88, at 8; see also S. Rep. No. 103‐\n                                                                                                                                                                                                \ndecisions. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 509 (“[T]he least restrictive means \nrequirement was not used in the pre‐Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to \ncodify.”); see also Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2761 n. 3 (observing that City of Boerne \nreflects an understanding that RFRA’s least restrictive means requirement \n“provided even broader protection for religious liberty than was available under \nthose [pre‐Smith] decisions”); id. at 2767 n. 18 (declining to decide whether \nRFRA’s least restrictive means requirement in fact “went beyond what was \nrequired by our pre‐Smith decisions”); id. at 2793 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“Our \ndecision in City of Boerne, it is true, states that the least restrictive means \nrequirement was not used in the pre‐Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to \ncodify. As just indicated, however, that statement does not accurately convey the \nCourtʹs pre‐Smith jurisprudence.”) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). If RFRA’s least restrictive means requirement in fact went beyond pre‐\nSmith jurisprudence, such an extension further supports our holding that RFRA \nprovides an individual damages remedy. We need not decide this dispute today, \nhowever, because our holding remains the same in light of RFRA’s statutory text \nand legislative history. \n

intended to limit the remedies available for RFRA violations. \n6    As an initial matter, the broader legislative history shows that the House \n7  and Senate Committee Reports were not using the term “relief” to refer to \n8  remedies. Rather, the reports were concerned with claimants bringing particular \n9

free exercise violation. Given this potential, we cannot say that the Senate \n12  Committee Report expressly intended to exclude such a remedy when it stated \n13  that it did not intend to “expand” or “alter” claimants’ ability to obtain relief. S. \n14  Rep. No. 103‐111, at 12.16 \n                                                            \n16 To be sure, the Supreme Court has subsequently shown “caution toward \nextending Bivens remedies into any new context,” Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, \n534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001), and “[s]ince Carlson in 1980, the Supreme Court has \ndeclined to extend the Bivens remedy in any new direction at all,” Arar v. \nAshcroft, 585 F.3d 559, 571 (2d Cir. 2009). This trend, however, was not clearly \napparent at the time of RFRA’s passage because the Court had recognized Bivens \n53 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg5e4  5o4f  5o7f 57\n1    Furthermore, even if the Senate Committee Report could be read to limit \n2  RFRA’s remedies to those explicitly authorized by the Supreme Court prior to \n3  Smith, the approach of the House Committee Report is not necessarily so narrow. \n4  Unlike the Senate Committee Report, which authorizes relief “consistent with the \n5  Supreme Courts’[] free exercise jurisprudence,” S. Rep. No. 103‐111, at 12, the \n6  House Committee Report authorizes relief so long as it is “consistent with free \n7  exercise jurisprudence, including Supreme Court jurisprudence,” H.R. Rep. No. \n8  103‐88, at 8. The House Committee Report therefore appears to have \n9  contemplated providing a broad array of relief consistent not only with Supreme \n10  Court jurisprudence but that of the lower courts as well. We thus find it highly \n11  relevant that at the time of RFRA’s passage, several Courts of Appeals had held \n12  that plaintiffs could pursue individual damages claims for violations of their free \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nclaims in three instances and denied such claims in four. See id. at 571‐72. \nAdditionally, although the Supreme Court in Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367, 368 \n(1983), held that federal employees could not bring Bivens claims against their \nsuperiors, the decision was narrow, and based on federal employees’ existing \naccess to “an elaborate remedial system” that protected their constitutional \nrights, id. at 388. That remedial framework is not applicable here, because the \nplaintiffs are not federal employees. Moreover, even if the trend away from \nextending Bivens were obvious when RFRA was passed, it still falls short of the \nSupreme Court’s clearly foreclosing an individual damages remedy for free \nexercise violations. We therefore conclude that it would not be a basis for finding \nthe Franklin presumption inapplicable here.  \n54 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg5e5  5o5f  5o7f 57\n1  exercise rights. See Caldwell v. Miller, 790 F.2d 589, 607‐608 (7th Cir. 1986); Jihaad v. \n2  OʹBrien, 645 F.2d 556, 558 n. 1 (6th Cir. 1981); see also Paton v. La Prade, 524 F.2d \n3  862, 870 (3d Cir. 1975) (holding that Bivens claims are broadly available for First \n4  Amendment violations); Scott v. Rosenberg, 702 F.2d 1263, 1271 (9th Cir. 1983) \n5  (assuming, without deciding, that the plaintiff could recover damages if his free \n6  exercise rights had been violated).  \n7    Accordingly, we do not believe that the legislative history evinces a clear \n8  and express indication that Congress intended to exclude individual damages \n9  claims from the scope of RFRA’s available relief, and we therefore conclude that \n10  the Franklin presumption is applicable. \n11  VI. Qualified Immunity \n12   \n13    Having held that RFRA authorizes a plaintiff to sue federal officers in their \n14  individual capacities for money damages, we consider whether those officers \n15  should be shielded by qualified immunity.  \n16    At the panel’s request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing \n17  addressing two questions: (1) “whether, assuming arguendo that RFRA authorizes \n18  suits against officers in their individual capacities, [Defendants] would be \n19  entitled to qualified immunity,” and (2) “whether Ziglar v. Abbasi, No. 15‐1358, \n55 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg5e6  5o6f  5o7f 57\n1  2017 WL 2621317 (June 19, 2017), applies in any relevant way to this question or \n2  the other questions presented in this appeal.” Order, Tanvir v. Tanzin, No. 16‐\n3  1176 (2d Cir. 2017), Dkt. No. 83; see also Post‐Argument Ltr. Brs., Tanvir v. Tanzin, \n4  No. 16‐1176 (2d Cir. 2017), Dkt Nos. 89‐90, 93‐94.    \n5    We are sensitive to the notion that qualified immunity should be resolved \n6  “at the earliest possible stage in the litigation.” Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 \n7  (1991). Indeed, we have, in some circumstances, “permitted the [qualified \n8  immunity] defense to be successfully asserted in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.” \n9  McKenna v. Wright, 386 F.3d 432, 435 (2d Cir. 2004). Nevertheless, as a general \n10  matter, “[i]t is our practice in this Circuit when a district court fails to address the \n11  qualified immunity defense to remand for such a ruling.” Eng v. Coughlin, 858 \n12  F.2d 889, 895 (2d Cir. 1988) (citing Francis v. Coughlin, 849 F.2d 778, 780 (2d Cir. \n13  1988)).  \n14    Here, the district court decision below did not address whether \n15  Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Similarly, until the panel \n16  prompted the parties at oral argument and in its post‐argument order, neither \n17  side fully addressed or briefed the issue of qualified immunity on appeal. In the \n18  absence of a more developed record, we decline to address in the first instance \n56 \n \n\nCaCsea s1e:1 136-c-1v1-07669, 5D1o-cRuAm  e Dnot c1u1m8,e 0n6t /12155/2  0 F1i8le, d2 30361/2459/51,8 P   aPgaeg5e7  5o7f  5o7f 57\n1  whether the Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. We remand to the \n2  district court to make such determination in the first instance. \n3   \n4   \n5  CONCLUSION \n6   \n7    For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the district court \n8  and remand for further proceedings. \n57 \n ",

Commerce Clearing \nHouse, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 26 n.6 (2d Cir. 1990).

The Court currently takes no position regarding the \nviability of Plaintiffs' possible motion for attorneys' fees and costs. \nBecause the parties agree that Plaintiffs' official capacity claims \nagainst Defendants may be dismissed without prejudice, the Court so \ndismisses them. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to enter \nfinal judgment in favor of Defendants. Plaintiffs may have until \nJanuary 29, 2016 to move for attorneys' fees and costs. If no motion \nis filed by that date, this action will be terminated on the docket. (As \nfurther set forth in this Order.)

USCA Case Number 16-1176. \nPlaintiffsAppellants Muhammad Tanvir, Jameel Algibah, and \nNaveed Shinwari (\"Plaintiffs\") appeal from a February 17, 2016 \nfinal judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York (Abrams, J.), dismissing their complaint \nagainst senior federal law enforcement officials and 25 named and \nunnamed federal law enforcement officers. The complaint alleged, \ninter alia, that in retaliation for Plaintiffs' refusal to serve as \ninformants, federal officers improperly placed or retained Plaintiffs' \nnames on the \"No Fly List,\" in violation of Plaintiffs' rights under \nthe First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000bb et seq. (\"RFRA\"). The complaint sought (1) \ninjunctive and declaratory relief against all defendants in their \nofficial capacities for various constitutional and statutory violations, \nand (2) compensatory and punitive damages from federal law \nenforcement officers in their individual capacities for violations of \n\ntheir rights under the First Amendment and RFRA. After the parties \nagreed to stay the official capacity claims, the district court \ndismissed Plaintiffs' individual capacity claims. As relevant here, the \ndistrict court held that RFRA does not permit the recovery of money \ndamages against federal officers sued in their individual capacities. \nPlaintiffs appeal that RFRA determination only. Because we \ndisagree with the district court, and hold that RFRA permits a \nplaintiff to recover money damages against federal officers sued in \ntheir individual capacities for violations of RFRA's substantive \nprotections, we reverse the district court's judgment and remand for \nfurther proceedings.
