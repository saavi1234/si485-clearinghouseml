The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Official-Capacity Defendants' Unopposed Motion 56 for Stay, or in the Alternative, Extension of Time. The Court agrees it is appropriate for the Official-Capacity Defendants to reconsider Plaintiff's DHS TRIP inquiry under new procedures, but the Court finds a stay is unnecessary to permit Defendants to do so. In addition, the Court notes this case is now over 18 months old and has not yet proceeded beyond the pleading stage. Accordingly, no later than March 9, 2015, Defendants shall complete a substantive reconsideration of Plaintiff's DHS TRIP inquiry consistent with Defendants' newly-created procedures and shall notify Plaintiff of the result of Defendants' reconsideration. No later than March 16, 2015, the parties shall submit a single, Joint Status Report in which they present their recommendations for the next steps in this case, including whether it is appropriate for Plaintiff to be permitted to file a Fourth Amended Complaint that takes into account Defendants' newly-created procedures before Defendants file their responsive pleading to Plaintiff's operative Complaint. The Joint Status Report shall specify an efficient schedule to advance this action past the initial pleadings and to make progress toward a final resolution without further delay. The Court will review the Joint Status Report upon its receipt and set a final case-management schedule shortly thereafter. (bb) (Entered: 01/14/2015)"

The Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion to the extent that the Court reconsiders its Opinion and Order 81 . Having reconsidered Plaintiff's arguments, however, the Court adheres to its conclusion that Plaintiff lacks standing to seek declaratory relief on Plaintiff's Claim Fifteen brought under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The Court will then take Motion 90 under advisement on 6/23/2016. With respect to Plaintiff's Unopposed Motion 91 to Stay Due Process Claims, the Court proposes to deny that Motion as premature with leave to renew in the context of a proposed case-management schedule to be set after the Court resolves Motion 90 to Dismiss.

Although the Court is willing to deem the Motion 40 withdrawn and to grant Plaintiff leave to file the Third Amended Complaint, Defendants' counsel requested time to consider the matter more fully.

He was denied boarding to a flight from the United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\") to the United States because of his alleged inclusion on the No Fly List.  He filed the lawsuit on May 30, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Terrorist Screening Center (\"TSC\"), which created and maintained the No Fly List.  Represented by the Council on American Islamic Relations as well as private counsel, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants placed him on the No Fly List to coerce him into becoming an informant for the FBI.  The plaintiff further alleged that during an interview in Sudan he was denied counsel by defendants and urged to become an FBI informant in order to have his name removed from the No Fly List.  Because the plaintiff refused to become an informant, he further alleged that the defendants retaliated by instigating and facilitating his torture in the UAE. </p><p>Based upon the foregoing allegations, the plaintiff alleged six claims for relief:  (1) violation of the right to citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) an unidentified cause of action pertaining to torture; (3) denial of his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment; (4) violation of his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment; (5) violation of his Fifth Amendment substantive due process right to return to his homeland once abroad; and (6) denial of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment because the defendants failed to inform him on the basis for his inclusion on, or the means of removing his name therefrom the No Fly List.</p><p>The plaintiff sought a declaration that his right to counsel was violated; redress for the defendants' instigating and facilitating his torture in the UAE; an injunction preventing the defendants from violating the above-mentioned rights; and monetary damages in the amount of $30,000,000.</p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Anna Brown.  On June 17, 2013, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint to add an additional defendant.  On November 4, 2013, the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.  The court heard oral argument on the defendants' motion on March 14, 2014 and took the motion under advisement.</p><p>On May 29, 2014, Judge Brown granted the official-capacity defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing all counts except three (denial of his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment) and four (violation of his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment). The plaintiff had leave to file a second amended complaint consistent with the opinion and order no later than June 27, 2014. 23 F.Supp.3d 1268 (D. Or. May 29, 2014),  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73174. The plaintiff eventually filed a series of amended complaints. </p><p>In 2015, the government revised the redress procedures available through administrative procedures as a result of the decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12886\">Latif v. Holder</a>, 28 F.Supp.3d 1134 (D.Or. 2014), which held various aspects of the process inadequate under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the APA.  As a result, the official-capacity defendants moved for a stay or, in the alternative, an extension of time to allow the defendants to reconsider the plaintiff's application under the new procedure.  However, after completing the re-evaluation, the defendants determined that the plaintiff should remain on the No-Fly List. </p><p>On January 14, 2015, Judge Brown granted in part and denied in part the official-capacity defendants' unopposed motion. The court agreed that it was appropriate for the official-capacity defendants to reconsider the plaintiff's DHS TRIP inquiry under the new procedures, but the court found that a stay was unnecessary to permit the defendants to do so. In addition, the court noted that this case was now over 18 months old and had not yet proceeded beyond the pleading stage. Accordingly, the court ordered the defendants to complete a substantive reconsideration of the plaintiff's DHS TRIP inquiry no later than March 9, 2015, to move the case along.</p><p>The plaintiff filed their corrected fourth amended complaint on April 6, 2015.  The defendants again filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction.  On November 4, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court held that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient (1) to state a substantive due process claim based on right to international travel; (2) to state procedural due process claim based on right to international travel and to be free from false government stigmatization; (3) to state a claim for injunctive relief under the Fourth Amendment because the plaintiff was subject to surveillance without a warrant, probable cause, or reasonable suspicion; and (4) to state a claim under the Wiretap Act.  However, the court also held that the plaintiff's allegations were not sufficient to state a claim under the Stored Communications Act and that he had failed to plead a valid waiver of sovereign immunity for his claim that the FBI failed to comply with FISA.  And the court held that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective injunctive relief on the claim that the FBI placed him on the No Fly List while he was abroad in order to subject him to custodial interrogation without the assistance of counsel, because that issue no longer affected him, personally. 142 F.Supp.3d 1152, 2015 WL 6756121, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151522.  The court again gave the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint to correct the deficiencies, and on November 29, 2015, the plaintiff filed his fifth amended complaint. </p><p>On March 16, 2016, Judge Brown found that plaintiff lacked standing to seek declaratory relief on their claim that was brought under the Fourth Amendment. On May 9, 2016, the defendants notified the court that the plaintiff was removed from the No Fly List. </p><p>On September 28, 2016, the courted issued an opinion and order, in which it granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissed with prejudice plaintiff’s fifth amended complaint, and denied as moot the defendants’ motion to stay the plaintiff’s due process claims. 2016 WL 5539591, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133307. On October 6, 2016, the plaintiff filed a notice in which he stated his non-objection to the court dismissing this action as to the individual capacity defendants, the actions of which were subsequently dismissed without prejudice by the court on October 24, 2016. </p><p>On December 23, 2016, the plaintiff appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 2, 2017, the appellant submitted their opening brief, arguing that (1) the court must reject defendants’ attempt to moot plaintiff’s claims by removing him from the No Fly List years after the start of the litigation; (2) the complaint states a Fourth Amendment Claim for Unlawful Surveillance, Search, and Seizure; and (3) the district court improperly concluded that declaratory relief was not available for the fourth amendment claim. In response, the government argued that (1) the plaintiff’s No Fly List claims are moot because he is no longer on the No Fly List; (2) the government had demonstrated that the alleged wrongful conduct is not likely to occur; (3) the plaintiff’s requests for injunctive relief for speculative future claims do not save his current claim from mootness; (4) the plaintiff’s No Fly List claims are not capable of repetition yet evading review; and (5) the district court correctly dismissed the plaintiff’s surveillance claims. Oral argument was scheduled for May 9, 2018 before Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson, Judge Morgan B. Christen, and Judge Marvin J. Garbis. On June 28, 2018, Judge Marvin J. Garbis retired and was replaced by Judge Milan D. Smith. </p><p>On September 20, 2018, the Ninth Circuit found that the allegations in the plaintiff’s fifth amended complaint were vague and conclusory, and did not give rise to a plausible claim for relief. Moreover, since the plaintiff had several opportunities to amend his complaint, and repeatedly failed to do so, the Ninth Circuit found that the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his Fourth Amendment claim with prejudice. 738 Fed.Appx. 545 (Mem), 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 26939, 2018 WL 4537720. In a separately filed opinion by Judge Christen, the panel reversed the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s action as moot, that alleged the FBI violated his substantive and procedural due process rights by placing and maintaining him on the No Fly List. The panel held that plaintiff’s removal from the No Fly List was more likely an exercise of discretion than a decision arising from a broad change in agency policy or procedure, and further held that the government had not assured plaintiff that he would not be banned from flying for the same reasons that prompted the government to add him to the list in the first place, nor had it verified the implementation of procedural safeguards conditioning its ability to revise plaintiff’s status on the receipt of new information. The panel subsequently reversed the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s due process claims and remanded for further proceedings. 904 F.3d 1033, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 26880. Costs were taxed against the appellees. </p><p>On October 25, 2018, the Ninth Circuit granted the defendants/appellees’ unopposed motion for an extension to file petition for panel rehearing on or before December 5, 2018. The plaintiff filed a petition on that date, but the Ninth Circuit unanimously denied the petition on January 2, 2019.</p><p>On May 19, 2019 the plaintiff filed another amended complaint. This one removed previously unresolved claims, added additional factual allegations for the due process claims, and added the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator as defendant. The plaintiffs wanted to add the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) head as a defendant as well, but Judge Brown did not allow this in her order partially granting and denying the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint on May 8. 2019 WL 2030724.</p><p>The case was reassigned to Judge Michael W. Mosman on July 15, 2019.</p><p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on July 20, 2019. Oral argument before Judge Mosman on the motion was held on November 14; after argument, the Judge granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice. He stated that arguments based on travel limitations were moot, but granted the plaintiff the opportunity to amend the complaint to further discuss stigma and reputational damage surrounding previous placement on the No Fly List, which is disseminated nationally and internationally.</p><p>The plaintiff filed an amended complaint expanding on the reputational harm of being on the No Fly List on December 18, 2019. The defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim on January 22, 2020; a hearing on that motion is set for June 15, 2020. The case is ongoing.</p>",

The criterion for placing an individual's name on the No-Fly List was \ndeveloped in secret by the Terrorism Screening Center without congressional oversight \nor approval. Under the present criterion, a person may be \"nominated\" to be on the List \nif \"there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is a known or suspected \nterrorist.\"  \n27.  Most individuals on the No-Fly List, and plaintiff in this action, are \nprohibited from flying on commercial aircraft into, out of, or over United States and \nCanadian airspace.  \nPlaintiff's Background, Travel, Imprisonment, Torture, and Release  \n28.  Plaintiff is a naturalized American citizen of Eritrean descent. When he \nwas a small boy, war broke out in Eritrea, and thus his family took him to Sudan, where \nhe was when the State of Eritrea came into being in 1993. From Sudan the Fikre family \nemigrated to the United States. \n29.  Beginning in 2006, plaintiff resided in Portland, Oregon. In late December \n2009, after working for an American cell phone company, plaintiff decided to attempt to \ndistribute and to sell consumer electronic products on the retail market in East Africa. \nHe began by returning to Sudan, where some of his extended family still reside. Upon \nPage 8 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 9 of 47\narrival in Sudan, plaintiff, in compliance with a recommendation by the State \nDepartment, contacted the United States Consulate in Khartoum and informed a \nrepresentative of the consulate of his interest in pursuing business opportunities in the \ncountry. The representative encouraged plaintiff to pursue business opportunities in \nSudan. In reliance upon the representative's recommendation plaintiff began the \nprocess of obtaining a Sudanese business license. \n30.  On Tuesday, April 20, 2010, defendant Noordeloos sent an email to \nplaintiff, which stated: \"Younas, I work at the embassy in Khartoum and need to meet up \nwith you on wed 4/21. Can you email me back and let me know what time in the \nafternoon works for you? Best, David Noordeloos US Department of State\".  \n31.  On Wednesday, April 21, defendant Noordeloos sent an email to plaintiff, \nwhich stated: \"Yonas, I hope this finds you well. I still need to meet with you as soon as \npossible, can you give me a call and let me know what time works for you to meet? You \ncan email me back or try me at the Embassy or on my cell, but please contact me \nsoonest. Regards, David Noordeloos, US Department of State\" [telephone numbers \nredacted]. \n32.  On April 21, at approximately 9 p.m. local time, plaintiff called the number \ngiven and spoke with defendant Noordeloos. Defendant Noordeloos stated that a \nnumber of Americans in Sudan had been invited to the Embassy for a luncheon the \nfollowing day in order to discuss how Americans might stay safe during a period of \npolitical turmoil in Sudan. Plaintiff agreed to attend the luncheon on that basis, which \nturned out to be a false pretense. \n33.  The next day plaintiff appeared at the embassy. After going through \nPage 9 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 10 of 47\nsecurity screening, plaintiff met defendant Noordeloos and another person, defendant \nJohn Doe I, who identified himself as Jason Dundas. Defendants Noordeloos and John \nDoe I (Jason Dundas) escorted plaintiff to a small meeting room and shut the door; \ndefendants positioning themselves between plaintiff and the door. At that point \ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) produced badges and stated \nthat they were FBI agents assigned to the Portland office.  \n34.  Upon being informed that defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason \nDundas) were FBI agents from the Portland office, plaintiff stated that he wanted to be \nrepresented by his legal counsel (plaintiff was then represented by Oregon attorney \nBrandon Mayfield) during the interrogation. Defendant Noordeloos denied Mr. Fikre’s \nrequest for such representation on the grounds that plaintiff had been placed on the No-\nFly List and thus could not return to the United States to confer with his attorney.  \n35.  Because defendants John Doe I (Jason Dundas) and Noordeloos were \nblocking the door, plaintiff, who had never before been detained or arrested, felt he \ncould not leave. During the following interrogation, defendants Noordeloos and John \nDoe I (Jason Dundas) questioned plaintiff extensively about the events, activities, and \nleadership at the as-Saber Mosque in Portland, which plaintiff had attended for prayer \nservices. Defendant Noordeloos also questioned plaintiff about the source of his \nfinancial support for this business endeavors in Sudan, and told plaintiff that, because of \nthe Sudan sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, it was illegal for \nplaintiff to engage in business transactions in Sudan - a statement that is inconsistent \nwith the advice and recommendation earlier given by the representative of the embassy \nas set forth in ¶ 29, supra.  \nPage 10 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 11 of 47\n36.  Defendant Noordeloos next told plaintiff that the FBI desired plaintiff to \nbecome an FBI informant to work upon “a case” that was then developing. Defendant \nNoordeloos stated that, in return, plaintiff would be paid substantial compensation, be in \na position to enjoy “the good life,” and that the FBI would take steps to remove plaintiff \nfrom the No-Fly List. Defendant Noordeloos then asked, \"Don't you love your wife?\", \nwhich question plaintiff considered an implicit threat. Plaintiff responded that he did not \nwish to become an FBI informant. The interview lasted for several hours until the close \nof the business day. As the day wore on, defendant Noordeloos suggested that they \nresume the discussion on the following day; in order to escape the interrogation room \nand leave the embassy, plaintiff agreed. \n37.  At approximately 8:45 a.m. on the following morning, plaintiff called \ndefendant Noordeloos and stated that he did not wish to meet further with the FBI \nagents because he would be wasting their and his time; he reiterated that he did not \nwish to become an informant for the FBI. Defendant Noordeloos became agitated and, \nto the best of plaintiff's recollection, stated, \"Wait a minute! Are you trying to tell me you \ndon't want to work with us!\" Defendant Noordeloos then stated, \"Whenever you want to \ngo home you come to the embassy.\" Plaintiff understood this to mean that plaintiff's \nname would not be removed from the No-Fly List and he could not travel to the United \nStates unless he became an informant/agent provocateur for the FBI. \n38.  On May 4, 2010, defendant Noordeloos wrote an email to plaintiff which \nstated: \"Yonas, Thanks for meeting with us last week in Sudan. While we hope to get \nyour side of issues we keep hearing about, the choice is yours to make. The time to \nhelp yourself is now. Be safe in Sudan, Dave Noordeloos.\" \nPage 11 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 12 of 47\n39.  Plaintiff remained in Khartoum for almost two months following his \nmeeting with defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas). During that time \nhe noticed that he was being followed by persons he assumed were affiliated with the \nSudanese secret police, and he was told by merchants and other acquaintances in his \nneighborhood that similar individuals had been inquiring about him and his activities. \n40.  On or about June 15, 2010, plaintiff left Sudan, and on or about \nSeptember 15, 2010, plaintiff arrived in the UAE to pursue similar business interests \ninvolving the distribution and retail sale of consumer electronics there. Plaintiff moved to \nthe city of Al Ain in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, where he sought and obtained a residency \npermit from the UAE in order to conduct business; he invested substantial financial \nresources provided by family members in pursuing that course. \n41.  In the evening of June 1, 2011, persons unknown to plaintiff (who plaintiff \nlater learned were UAE plainclothes secret police) invaded plaintiff's home in Al Ain, \nseized plaintiff's computer, phone, and other items, and compelled plaintiff to \naccompany them in a vehicle. Several of plaintiff's friends and neighbors witnessed \nplaintiff's apprehension. Plaintiff was blindfolded, placed in a confined space in the \nvehicle, and the air conditioner in the vehicle was turned on high and directed at him \nwith the effect that he became quite chilled. \n42.  Plaintiff was taken to a then-unknown location approximately two hours’ \ndriving time from Al Ain. Still blindfolded, he was led into a building and into a long hall \nwhere, by peeking down through the bottom of his blindfold, he noticed that he was \npassing door after door. His guards stopped at one door and put him inside a \nwindowless cell where he was lodged. Upon removal of his blindfold, he saw that his \nPage 12 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 13 of 47\ntiny cell lacked toilet facilities. His cell contained only a bed and some bedding. The cell \nwas very cold because the air conditioning had been set on high.  \n43.  The following morning the interrogations of plaintiff began. Except for the \none instance noted below, during all of his interrogations plaintiff was blindfolded. Once \nblindfolded, he was taken to a room where, throughout his ordeal, plaintiff was \nquestioned for hours in English. Periodically during the 106 days of his imprisonment \nand torture, plaintiff occasionally was able to peek beneath the blindfold and view shoes \nand the lower torsos of his interrogators.  \n44.  The primary focus of the blindfolded interrogations was events at \nPortland's as-Saber Mosque, addressing in particular who plaintiff knew at the mosque \nwho had a \"jihadi mentality,\" what topics the mosque's leader, Sheikh Mohamed Kariye, \nspeaks about both in public and in private, and how fundraising at the mosque occurs \nand who engages in fundraising there. The interrogators also questioned plaintiff about \ncircumstances and events that plaintiff had disclosed to defendants Noordeloos and \nJohn Doe I (Jason Dundas) during his interrogation at the embassy in Khartoum. \nNumerous times during the blindfolded interrogations plaintiff's interrogators urged him \nto cooperate with them and with the FBI by becoming an informant.  \n45.  When plaintiff was returned to his cell at the end of the first day of \ninterrogation he discovered that his bed and bedding had been removed. The air \nconditioning remained at a high level, which made the cell extremely cold. Because his \nbed and bedding had been removed, plaintiff was obliged to sleep almost naked on the \ncold cement floor.   \n46.  During the initial period of his confinement plaintiff resisted answering \nPage 13 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 14 of 47\nsome of the questions, insisting that he was an American citizen and needed to speak \nwith his ambassador and with his attorney. In response, plaintiff's jailers struck him on \nhis head and he fell to the ground. Throughout course of his confinement plaintiff was \nrepeatedly beaten severely on his head, back, legs, and feet with batons and plastic \npipes, required to assume stress positions for hours, and threatened with death by \nstrangulation by use of a flexible plastic pipe. One particularly painful torture method his \ninterrogators used was to force plaintiff to lie on his stomach with his sandals off, \nwhereupon he was beaten severely on the soles of his feet; thereafter, he was required \nto stand on his feet, which standing caused him great pain. \n47.  On several occasions plaintiff told his interrogators that the questions he \nwas being asked and the suggestions of cooperation with the FBI were the same \nquestions and suggestion he had heard from defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I \n(Jason Dundas); he thus inquired whether his confinement and mistreatment was at the \nrequest of the FBI. On each such occasion the interrogators responded by beating \nplaintiff severely.   \n48.  As noted above, during his interrogations plaintiff was occasionally able to \npeek beneath his blindfold and view the lower torsos of his interrogators. On most \noccasions, based on their clothing and accents, plaintiff believes that his interrogators \nwere Arabs. On other occasions, however, plaintiff was able to view the shoes and \nslacks of several individuals who wore Western dress. Plaintiff believes that in those \ninstances some or all of the Individual defendants, acting as representatives of the \nUnited States, were present and witnessed the interrogations and that those Individual \ndefendants participated in interrogating plaintiff.  \nPage 14 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 15 of 47\n49.  All Individual defendants who attended and participated in the \ninterrogation of plaintiff were present with the permission, and were under the physical \nand legal control, of UAE authorities who operated and maintained the secret prison. \n50.  On or about June 14, 2011, plaintiff was informed that he had to take a lie \ndetector test. During the test, for the only time during his confinement, plaintiff was \nquestioned without a blindfold in place. The questioning during the test focused not \nupon events at Portland's as-Saber Mosque but, rather, upon whether plaintiff's financial \narrangements involved soliciting funds for al-Qaeda. Following the lie detector test \nplaintiff’s bed and bedding were returned to his cell.  \n51.  The interrogations, including beatings and stress positions, as well as \nbeing subjected to temperature extremes, sleep deprivation, and humiliation when not \nbeing interrogated, continued daily from June 14 through July 27.  \n52.  On June 20, 2011, immediately after learning from plaintiff's family that \nplaintiff had been apprehended in the UAE (the family had learned of plaintiff's \napprehension from witnesses who observed the event), Oregon counsel Thomas \nNelson telephoned and then e-mailed the United States Consulate in Abu Dhabi to \ninform them that plaintiff, a United States citizen, had gone missing and that witnesses \nin Al Ain had viewed him being placed in a SUV of the type that is commonly used by \nthe UAE secret police. The consulate officials indicated that they would look into the \nmatter.  \n53.  On July 21, 2011, plaintiff's Oregon counsel Thomas Nelson on behalf of \nplaintiff contacted Representative Earl Blumenauer's office to request assistance in \nlocating plaintiff and made contact with staff member Emily Barrett. Ms. Barrett stated \nPage 15 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 16 of 47\nthat Congressman Blumenauer would look into the situation. \n54.  On July 28, 2011, plaintiff was informed that a woman from the American \nconsulate had arrived to see him. He was told that he was to meet with the American \nconsul and that he should not disclose to the consular officer that he had been \nmistreated during his detention lest he beaten still more severely. \n55.  On July 28, 2011, plaintiff, accompanied by two guards, was taken to a \nmeeting room where he met “Marwa,” a consular employee of the State Department \nwho, on information and belief, is of Egyptian extraction. The two guards positioned \nthemselves close to plaintiff, one on each side. Marwa was dressed in Islamic attire (a \n“hijab,” or covering of her hair). By that time plaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds \nof body weight. \n56.  The meeting with Marwa was short and superficial. Although by that time \nplaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds, Marwa stated that plaintiff appeared to be in \ngood shape. During the interview plaintiff attempted by facial contortions and winks to \nindicate that he was under duress, but Marwa either did not notice or disregarded these \nsignals. \n57.  Marwa questioned plaintiff regarding what offense he had been charged \nwith, whereupon plaintiff asked the two guards what he had been charged with. The \nguards stated that plaintiff was being held without charge and that the authorities were \nmerely conducting an investigation.  \n58.  Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff was returned to his cell and the \ninterrogations and torture resumed. Marwa’s visit was the only United States consular \nvisit during plaintiff's 106 days of detention and torture; the consulate did not visit or \nPage 16 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 17 of 47\nmake any contact with plaintiff during his remaining 49 days of his confinement and \ntorture, nor did it provide any assistance to plaintiff when he was deported from the \nUAE. \n59.  Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff became despondent. Because \nthe consul's office had sent a Muslim woman wearing a hijab to interact with the prison \nauthorities and the two guards, plaintiff came to believe that, because of his black skin, \nthe United States had “thrown [him] away.” He consequently began to consider refusing \nfood in an attempt at suicide, but was told that he would be force-fed if necessary. \n60.  Toward the end of his interrogation plaintiff again inquired of his \ninterrogator whether the FBI had requested that he be detained and interrogated. This \ntime, instead of being beaten, the interrogator stated that indeed the FBI had made \nsuch a request and that the American and Emerati authorities work closely on a number \nof such matters. \n61.  On September 14, 2011, plaintiff was told that he would be released that \nday but would have to leave the UAE and stay out for at least a year. His belongings \nwere returned to him and money from his wallet was taken to buy him a plane ticket \nback to the United States while plaintiff remained in custody. Such a ticket was \npurchased from a travel agency; however, when the jailer took the ticket to the airport to \nobtain a boarding pass, the boarding pass was refused on the grounds that plaintiff was \non the No-Fly List. \n62.  Plaintiff's custodian was visibly upset because he could not board the flight \nout of the UAE, and asked plaintiff, “What kind of country would refuse a citizen’s return \nto his own country?” or words to that effect. The custodian then reiterated that plaintiff \nPage 17 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 18 of 47\ncould not stay in the UAE, and therefore would have to go somewhere else, and asked \nwhere plaintiff wished to be sent. Because plaintiff had a relative in Sweden, plaintiff \nindicated that he should be sent there. Therefore, the custodian took more money from \nplaintiff's wallet and arranged the purchase of a ticket to Stockholm, Sweden. This time \na boarding pass was issued for plaintiff. \n63.  The United States consulate in the UAE knew or should have known that \nplaintiff would be deported upon his release from prison, but the consulate took no \naction to provide assistance to plaintiff upon his release. \n64.  Plaintiff arrived in Sweden traumatized, with few financial and other \nresources, and clothing entirely inappropriate for the Scandinavian weather and climate. \n65.  Shortly after arriving in Stockholm plaintiff contacted the airline that had \nrefused to issue him a boarding pass in the UAE and discussed his situation with them. \nThe representative he spoke with confirmed that he had been denied boarding on the \nflight from the UAE to the United States but stated that she could not provide any \nreasons for such refusal. Plaintiff then requested a refund of the ticket price, but the \nrepresentative stated that because the ticket had been purchased through a travel \nagency in the UAE he would have to get the refund (if any) from that travel agency. \n66.  To date plaintiff has been unable to obtain a refund for the unused ticket \nfrom the UAE to the United States.  \n67.  In addition to being stranded with few resources in a foreign country, being \nplaced on the No-Fly List resulted in plaintiff's losing virtually all of his rights as a citizen \nof the United States - he could not return home to enjoy the rights, privileges and \nimmunities of citizenship. Moreover, his experience with State Department officials in \nPage 18 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 19 of 47\nKhartoum and Abu Dhabi demonstrated to him that the State Department would neither \nprotect nor assist him while overseas; rather, it would actively work to his detriment. \n68.  Nationals of one country are allowed to visit foreign countries for only \nlimited periods of time before they have to leave the country they are visiting; in the \ncase of Sweden and other Schengen Agreement countries the maximum stay is for 90 \ndays for holders of United States passports unless special arrangements are made, \nsuch as requesting asylum. \n69.  Upon arriving in Sweden and being unable to return home, plaintiff \ncontacted a Swedish attorney, Advokat Hans Bredberg, who suggested that plaintiff \nseek protective asylum in that country. Believing that the United States, through the FBI, \nwas responsible for his detention and torture in Abu Dhabi and that he may still be in \ndanger of abuse in countries that condone torture (including the United States), plaintiff \nsubmitted an application for asylum to the authorities in Sweden. \n70.  On April 18, 2012, a press conference was held in Advokat Bredberg's \noffice in Stockholm during which plaintiff's ordeal was disclosed publicly. Less than two \nweeks later, on May 1, 2012, plaintiff and two other individuals were indicted in the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of California, Docket No. 3:12-cr-\n06189-JAH, for \"conspiracy to structure\" monetary transfers from his family to him in the \nUAE between April 14, 2010, and April 19, 2010, which funds plaintiff used to attempt to \nstart his business. On information and belief, this indictment was in retaliation for \nplaintiff's publicizing of his ordeal through the April 18, 2012 press conference in \nStockholm, and based at least in part upon information the United States obtained from \nthe interview at the United States Embassy in Khartoum, from plaintiff's 106 days of \nPage 19 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 20 of 47\ninterrogation and torture in the UAE, and from the electronic surveillance of plaintiff.  \n71.  Sometime in the fall of 2013 counsel for defendants  contacted counsel for \nplaintiff and suggested that if plaintiff wished to return to the United States he should \nvisit the United States embassy in Stockholm to make necessary arrangements. After \nconferring with plaintiff in Stockholm, plaintiff's representatives informed defendants' \ncounsel that plaintiff was apprehensive about entering the embassy grounds and that \nplaintiff would, under the present circumstances, consider returning if the United States \n(1) guaranteed plaintiff's safety from extra-judicial actions, and (2) provided adequate \nassurances that plaintiff could leave the United States once he returned. Counsel for \ndefendants indicated that the United States would not provide such guarantees and \nassurances. \n72.  In early November 2013 plaintiff filed with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) a Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (“TRIP”) request and was \nassigned a redress number. By letter dated January 23, 2014, DHS informed plaintiff \nthat \"It has been determined that no changes or corrections are warranted at this time\" \nand suggesting that plaintiff might wish to take an administrative appeal from this \ndecision. Because it was unclear from the DHS letter whether plaintiff was then on the \nNo-Fly List, and thus it was unclear whether plaintiff was aggrieved by this decision, by \nletter dated February 24, 2014, plaintiff requested clarification and a stay pending \nresolution of this issue and the resolution of the current litigation. By letter dated March \n11, 2014, DHS replied that an extension to take an appeal would be granted to April 22, \n2014. Plaintiff then abandoned his efforts with DHS.  \n73.  Because of the separation occasioned by plaintiff's inability to return to the \nPage 20 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 21 of 47\nUnited States and because of the stigma attaching to plaintiff occasioned by the United \nStates' putting him on the No-Fly List, plaintiff's wife sought and received a divorce from \nplaintiff.  \n74.  Early in 2015 plaintiff's application for asylum in Sweden was denied.  \n75.  On February 12, 2015, the DHS by letter informed plaintiff that DHS had \non its own motion \"reevaluated\" plaintiff's prior TRIP inquiry and informed plaintiff that \nhe was on the No-Fly List because he had been \"identified as an individual who 'may be \na threat to civil aviation or national security.'\" The DHS provided no factual bases to \nsupport this conclusion, and requested plaintiff's response. By a letter dated February \n19, 2015, plaintiff categorically denied that he was or is a threat and stated that the bare \nconclusion contained in the DHS latter of February 12, 2015, prevented plaintiff from \nproviding a meaningful response; consequently, plaintiff asserted that the February 12, \n2015, letter violated plaintiff's due process rights. By a \"Decision and Order\" dated \nMarch 9, 2015, the DHS indicated that plaintiff's name would remain on the No-Fly List. \n76.  On February 14, 2015, the Swedish government transported plaintiff to \nPortland, Oregon, by private jet.  \nPlaintiff's Surveillance, Indictment, and Dismissal \n77.  In 2010, while he was inside the United States, plaintiff and his brother \nDawit Woldehawariat - both US citizens - worked together to set up a lawful business \nventure abroad. In furtherance of this objective, plaintiff and his brother discussed the \nparameters of the business venture they envisioned and the financial resources \nnecessary to execute their plan.  These discussions occurred by telephone, email, and \ntext message. \nPage 21 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 22 of 47\n78.  Unbeknownst at the time to either plaintiff or his brother, defendants were \nintercepting and/or acquiring the content of plaintiff’s telephone calls, his text messages, \nand his emails. Plaintiff now knows this because the United States has confirmed, \nthrough Department of Justice filings submitted in a since-dismissed prosecution \nagainst plaintiff in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, \nthat it intercepted the contents of plaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text messages. \nSee U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Docket No. 3:12-cr-06189-\nJAH, Doc. # 10. \n79.  These interceptions and/or acquisitions of plaintiff’s telephone calls, \nemails, and text messages were not conducted pursuant to a warrant and were not \nsupported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion. \n80.  On information and belief, the information upon which defendants caused \nplaintiff to meet with defendant FBI agents Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) \nin Khartoum and upon which defendants caused the UAE to imprison and torture \nplaintiff was derived from illegal surveillance and searches.  \n81.  On information and belief, information derived from the electronic \nsurveillance of plaintiff has been disseminated to several agencies and foreign \ngovernments including but not limited to the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \nSecurity Council, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, \nthe Department of Justice/Federal Bureau of Investigation, the US Attorney’s Office for \nthe District of Oregon, the Department of the Treasury and the National Security \nAgency, and the United Arab Emirates. \n82.  More than six months before the filing of the additional claims set forth in \nPage 22 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 23 of 47\nthis Third Amended Complaint, plaintiff filed a federal tort claim notice with the \nDepartment of Justice, NSA, FBI, and other agencies for violating the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, the Wiretap Act, and the Stored Communications Act, and \nrelated claims. The named agencies have failed to make a final disposition of the claims \nat this time, and therefore plaintiff deems such failure to be a denial thereof. \n83.  Plaintiff has suffered mistreatment at the hands of defendants including, \nbut not limited to, being placed on the No-Fly List without notice of the factual bases \ntherefor or the opportunity to be heard, denial of legal counsel, false arrest and false \nimprisonment, assault and battery, torture, violation of his right to freedom of \nassociation, illegal surveillance, violation of his right to privacy, and violation of his \nsubstantive and procedural due process rights. Plaintiff intends to continue to attempt to \nexercise his rights, including the right to legal counsel, to travel by air, to be free from \nfalse arrest and false imprisonment, assault and battery, and torture, to freedom of \nassociation, and his substantive and procedural due process rights, but based upon \ndefendants' past misconduct plaintiff has a reasonable fear of further future \nmistreatment by defendants and other agents of the United States. \nClaim One \nFifth Amendment Substantive Due Process - Fundamental Right to Return to \nUnited States  \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n84.  Plaintiff, once outside of the United States, has a fundamental liberty right \nunder the Fifth Amendment to return by air to, and to re-enter, the United States. \nDefendants have violated and are continuing to violate this right by placing plaintiff \nwithout cause on the No-Fly List after he had departed the United States and then \nmaintaining his name on that List after he had been arrested and incarcerated in the \nPage 23 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 24 of 47\nUAE, knowing at that time that the UAE would deport him from the UAE upon his \nrelease from prison without charge, which caused plaintiff to be deported to Sweden \ninstead of being allowed to return home, all in violation of plaintiff's Fifth Amendment \nsubstantive due process right to return to his homeland. \n85.  Defendants are continuing to violate this right by continuing to maintain \nplaintiff on the No-Fly List, preventing him from returning by air to the United States \nshould he again leave the United States.  But for his placement on the No-Fly List, \nplaintiff would continue to travel overseas and return to the United States by air. \n86.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \n \nClaim Two \nFifth Amendment Substantive Due Process - Right to International Travel \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n87.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83.  \n88.  Plaintiff has a liberty right to international travel under the Fifth \nAmendment. By placing plaintiff's name on the No-Fly List, defendants have violated \nand are continuing to violate this right, preventing plaintiff from departing, flying over, or \nreturning to the United States, all in violation of plaintiff's Fifth Amendment substantive \ndue process right to travel internationally.  \n89.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \nPage 24 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 25 of 47\n \nClaim Three \nFifth Amendment Due Process - Vagueness  \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n90.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83.  \n91.  Plaintiff has a due process right not to be sanctioned based upon vague, \noverbroad, or unknowable standards of conduct. The No-Fly List is an administrative \nsanction created by defendant Terrorism Screening Center, and according to \ndefendants' joint stipulation in the Latif case, the standard for placing individuals on the \nNo-Fly List is the \"existence of a reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is a \nknown or suspected terrorist.\"  Emphasis added.  \n92.  The \"existence of a reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is a \nknown or suspected terrorist\" is vague, and because of such vagueness has led to \ndiscriminatory application of the criterion and its use to unconstitutionally coerce \npersons placed on the No-Fly List, specifically by coercing plaintiff and others placed on \nthe List to become agents, agents provocateur, or informants for the FBI in return for \nhaving their names removed from the List. \n93.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \n \nClaim Four \nFifth Amendment - Violation of Right to Counsel \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n94.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83.  \n95.  It is a policy, custom, and practice of defendants to place individuals on \nPage 25 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 26 of 47\nthe No-Fly List once they have departed the United States in order to arrange for \ninterrogation of such individuals at American embassies abroad without the assistance \nof legal counsel. In plaintiff's case, upon being informed by defendant Noordeloos that \nNoordeloos was an FBI agent and wished to question plaintiff, plaintiff requested to be \nrepresented by counsel during such interrogation. In response, defendant Noordeloos in \nviolation of plaintiff’s Fifth Amendment right to counsel told plaintiff he could not have \nlegal counsel because plaintiff was on the No-Fly List, whereupon the interrogation \ncontinued for several hours.  \n96.  Defendants used the information gathered from plaintiff during such \ninterrogation to, among other things, obtain an indictment against plaintiff in the \nSouthern District of California, and an arrest warrant was issued calling for plaintiff's \narrest, all in further violation of plaintiff's Fifth Amendment right to counsel.  \n97.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \n \nClaim Five  \nFifth Amendment – Violation of Right to Counsel and Right Against Self-\nIncrimination  \nDamages  \n(Against Defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas)) \n98.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83. \n99.  Defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) refused plaintiff's \ndemand to be represented by counsel in Khartoum, Sudan, on April 22, 2010. Instead, \nthose defendants continued to interrogate plaintiff notwithstanding such demand and \nthen turned over such information to United States law enforcement defendants, which \nPage 26 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 27 of 47\nused information gleaned from plaintiff in securing his indictment in the District Court for \nthe Southern District of California. \n100.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) which deprived plaintiff of his \nright to counsel give rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth \nAmendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n \nClaim Six \nFifth Amendment Procedural Due Process -  \nPlacement and Retention on the No-Fly List \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n101.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83.  \n102.  Plaintiff has a protected liberty interest in international travel.  Plaintiff also \nhas a protected liberty interest in his reputation and in freedom from government-\nassigned stigmas that restrict or prevent him from engaging in activities in which he \ncould otherwise engage and in which others not stigmatized are free to engage. \n103.  Defendants‘ actions in placing and keeping plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, \nsecret No-Fly List substantially interferes with and deprives plaintiff of his liberty interest \nin international travel.  Defendants‘ actions in placing and keeping plaintiff on the FBI-\nmaintained, secret No-Fly List also injures plaintiff’s liberty interest in his reputation by, \nfirst, stigmatizing him as a known or suspected terrorist and as an individual who \nrepresents a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and who is \noperationally capable of doing so and, second, on the basis of that stigma, depriving \nhim of the ability to travel by air domestically and internationally as others are permitted \nto do and as plaintiff would be permitted to do absent the stigma.  \nPage 27 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 28 of 47\n104.  Defendants‘ actions in placing and keeping plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, \nsecret No-Fly List without informing him of such placement, of the basis for his inclusion \non the No-Fly List, of the means of removing his name from the No-Fly List, and without \nproviding an independent forum in which plaintiff might secure the removal of his name \nfrom the No-Fly List, all violated and are continuing to violate plaintiff’s right to \nprocedural due process under the Fifth Amendment.  Such procedures as do exist for \nchallenging inclusion on the No-Fly List are inadequate to satisfy the notice and hearing \nrequirements of procedural due process. \n105.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \n \nClaim Seven \nFirst Amendment - Violation of Right to Freedom of Association \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n106.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83.  \n107.  It is a policy, custom, and practice of defendants to place individuals on \nthe No-Fly List in order to coerce them into becoming informants/agents provocateur for \nthe FBI. Plaintiff has a right under the First Amendment to associate, and not to \nassociate, with whom he pleases. Defendants placed plaintiff on the No-Fly List in order \nboth to coerce plaintiff into associating with the FBI, and to coerce plaintiff into harming \nhis associations with others with whom he associates, by becoming an informant/agent \nprovocateur in a case then under investigation in Portland. Moreover, when plaintiff \ndeclined to become an informant and agent provocateur, defendants maintained \nplaintiff's name on the No-Fly List in retaliation, which ultimately led to plaintiff's being \nPage 28 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 29 of 47\nforced to seek protection and asylum in Sweden, all in violation of plaintiff's First \nAmendment right of freedom of association.  \n108.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \n \nClaim Eight \nFifth Amendment - False Arrest and Imprisonment \nDamages \n(Against Defendants Noordeloos, John Doe I (Jason Dundas), and John/Jane \nDoes II-X) \n109.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83.   \n110.  Plaintiff has a Fifth Amendment right to be free from false arrest and \nimprisonment.  On information and belief, some or all of individual defendants \nNoordeloos, John Doe I (Jason Dundas), and John/Jane Does II-X enlisted foreign \nintermediaries to cause the arrest of plaintiff by UAE secret police without probable \ncause that he had committed a crime.

On information and belief, the actions, orders, authorizations, and other \nconduct of defendants Noordeloos, John Doe I (Jason Dundas), and John/Jane Does \nXI-XX deprived plaintiff of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unconstitutional \nsearches and seizures and give rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the \nFourth Amendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal \nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of \n$10 million. \n \nClaim Fifteen \nFourth Amendment Violation \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n (Against All Defendants)  \n145.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83. \n146.  The Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in \ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \nsupported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, \nand the persons or things to be seized.” \n147.  Plaintiff’s telephone communications, emails, text messages, and other \ncommunications are protected from interception, search, and seizure by the Fourth \nAmendment. Plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephone \ncommunications, emails, text messages, and other communications. \n148.  Plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by defendants’ \ninterception, search, and seizure of plaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text \nmessages.  Defendants’ actions were not authorized by a warrant satisfying the Fourth \nAmendment, were not supported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and were \nPage 38 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 39 of 47\nunreasonable. \n149.  Provisions of the Patriot Act and FISA authorize defendants to acquire the \nconstitutionally protected communications of U.S. citizens and residents (i) without \nidentifying the people to be surveilled, (ii) without specifying the facilities, places, \npremises, or property to be monitored, (iii) without observing meaningful limitations on \nthe retention, analysis, and dissemination of acquired information, (iv) without obtaining \nindividualized warrants based on criminal or foreign intelligence probable cause, and (v) \nwithout making prior administrative determinations that the targets of surveillance are \nforeign agents or connected in any way, however tenuously, to terrorism. \n150.  On information and belief, defendants continue to retain, use, and disclose \nplaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text messages, and information derived \ntherefrom, that defendants unconstitutionally seized.  By these actions, defendants are \nirreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law for defendants’ \ncontinuing unlawful conduct, and defendants will continue to violate plaintiff’s legal \nrights unless enjoined and restrained by this Court.  Plaintiff seeks an injunction \nrequiring defendants to return or destroy any of plaintiff’s unconstitutionally seized \ntelephone calls, emails, or text messages, or information derived therefrom, that \ndefendants continue to retain, and prohibiting any use or disclosure of those \ncommunications and information. \n151.  Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the provisions of the Patriot Act and FISA \nwhich permit the federal government to secretly collect, disseminate, and retain \ninformation from a person and which allow one to perform electronic surveillance and \nwiretaps of a person without first demonstrating to a court the existence of probable \ncause that the person has committed a crime are unconstitutional. \n \nPage 39 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 40 of 47\nClaim Sixteen \nViolation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nDamages \n(Against Defendants United States of America, Defendant Noordeloos, John Doe \nI, and John/Jane Does XI-XX) \n152.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83. \n153.  On information and belief, defendants unlawfully engaged in electronic \nsurveillance of plaintiff and unlawfully used and/or disclosed information obtained by \nelectronic surveillance of plaintiff, in violation of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(a),(b),(h),(i), 1804(a), \n1806(a), 1809(a)(1), and 1809(a)(2). \n154.  Plaintiff and his brother are not foreign powers or agents of foreign \npowers, and there has never been any probable cause to believe so.  The information \nobtained from defendants’ electronic surveillance of their communications is not foreign \nintelligence information.  Obtaining foreign intelligence was not the primary purpose and \nwas not a significant purpose of defendants’ electronic surveillance of plaintiff’s \ncommunications.  The information defendants obtained from their electronic surveillance \nof plaintiff’s communications could have been obtained by normal investigative \ntechniques, e.g., normal criminal wiretap warrants conforming to the Fourth \nAmendment’s warrant requirement.    \n155.  Defendant United States is liable in damages to plaintiff pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. § 2712 for the unlawful use and disclosure of information.  Defendants \nNoordeloos, John Doe I, and John/Jane Does XI-XX are liable in damages pursuant to \n50 U.S.C. § 1810.  \n \nClaim Seventeen \nViolation of the Stored Communications Act \nDamages \n(Against Defendants United States of America and John/Jane Does XI-XX) \n156.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 83. \nPage 40 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 41 of 47\n157.  On information and belief, defendants United States, FBI, NSA, and John \nDoes XI-XX intercepted and/or acquired, disseminated, and otherwise utilized plaintiff’s \nstored communications, including but not limited to emails and text messages, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2703.     \n158.  Defendant United States is liable in damages to plaintiff pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. § 2712.  Defendants John/Jane Does XI-XX are liable in damages pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. § 2707(a). \n \nClaim Eighteen \nViolation of the Wiretap Act \nDamages \n(Against Defendants United States of America and John/Jane Does XI-XX) \n159.  Plaintiff re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 83. \n160.  On information and belief, Defendants United States, FBI, NSA, and John \nDoes XI-XX intercepted and/or acquired, disseminated, and otherwise utilized plaintiff’s \nelectronic communications, including but not limited to phone conversations with his \nbrother, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2511.     \n161.  Defendant United States is liable in damages to plaintiff pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. § 2712.  Defendants John/Jane Does XI-XX are liable in damages pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. § 2520(a). \n \nClaim Nineteen \nMotion For Return Of Unlawfully Searched And Seized Property Pursuant To \nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g) \n(Against All Defendants) \n162.  Plaintiff re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 83. \n163.  This Court has civil equitable jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Criminal \nProcedure 41(g) to order the return of illegally searched and seized property.  U.S. v. \nComprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).  \nPage 41 - FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT (corrected), Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 62    Filed 04/06/15    Page 42 of 47\n164.  Defendants have unlawfully searched, seized, used, and disclosed \nplaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text messages, and information derived \ntherefrom. Plaintiff is aggrieved by defendants’ unlawful search, seizure, use, and \ndisclosure of these communications and information. \n165.  Plaintiff seeks an order directing the return or destruction of plaintiff’s \nunconstitutionally seized telephone calls, emails, or text messages, or information \nderived therefrom, in the possession, custody, or control of defendants, their agents, \nsuccessors, and assigns, and all those in active concert and participation with them.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:  \n1.

(ecp) (Entered: 10/02/2014)\n10/03/2014 50  MINUTES of Proceedings: On October 3, 2014, the Court conferred briefly with\ncounsel concerning Plaintiff's stated intention to seek leave to file a Third Amended\nComplaint notwithstanding that Defendants' Motion 40 to Dismiss (against Plaintiff's\nSecond Amended Complaint) is pending Defendants' Reply and the Court's\nconsideration. Although the Court is willing to deem the Motion 40 withdrawn and to\ngrant Plaintiff leave to file the Third Amended Complaint, Defendants' counsel\nrequested time to consider the matter more fully. Accordingly, no later than October\n14, 2014, Defendants shall file either (a) their Reply in further support of the Motion,\nin which case the Court will consider the merits of the Motion and any Motion by\nPlaintiff for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint, or (b) Defendants' consent that\nPlaintiff file his Third Amended Complaint and Defendants' withdrawal of their\nMotion 40 with leave to refile similar arguments in response to the Third Amended\nComplaint.

No later\nthan 11/4/2014, Defendants shall file either (a) their Reply in further support of the\nMotion, in which case the Court will consider the merits of the Motion and any Motion\nby Plaintiff for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint, or (b) Defendants' consent\nthat Plaintiff file his Third Amended Complaint and Defendants' withdrawal of their\nMotion 40 with leave to refile similar arguments in response to the Third Amended\nComplaint.

Brown. The Court has reviewed Defendants' Notice 53 and, in\nlight thereof, GRANTS Plaintiff leave to file his Third Amended Complaint no later\nthan 11/14/14. In the exercise of its case−management discretion, the Court also\nGRANTS Defendants until 1/14/15 to file their Answer or other responsive pleadings\nto the Third Amended Complaint. Accordingly, it appears to the Court that the filing\nof such Third Amended Complaint will render moot the Motion 40 of some\nDefendants to dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint and, unless the Court\nreceives by 11/14/14 a justification to maintain Motion #40 on the docket, the Court\nwill strike Motion #40 as moot as of that date.

(Nelson,\nThomas) (Entered: 11/13/2014)\n01/13/2015 56  Unopposed Motion for Stay , or in the Alternative, Extension of Time to Answer or\nOtherwise Respond. Filed by James B. Comey, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Eric\nHolder, John Kerry, National Security Agency, Christopher M. Piehota, Michael S.\nRogers, State Department. (Bowen, Brigham) (Entered: 01/13/2015)\n01/14/2015 57  ORDER by Judge Anna J. Brown. The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part\nthe Official−Capacity Defendants' Unopposed Motion 56 for Stay, or in the\nAlternative, Extension of Time. The Court agrees it is appropriate for the\nOfficial−Capacity Defendants to reconsider Plaintiff's DHS TRIP inquiry under new\nprocedures, but the Court finds a stay is unnecessary to permit Defendants to do so. In\naddition, the Court notes this case is now over 18 months old and has not yet\nproceeded beyond the pleading stage. Accordingly, no later than March 9, 2015,\nDefendants shall complete a substantive reconsideration of Plaintiff's DHS TRIP\ninquiry consistent with Defendants' newly−created procedures and shall notify\nPlaintiff of the result of Defendants' reconsideration. No later than March 16, 2015, the\nparties shall submit a single, Joint Status Report in which they present their\nrecommendations for the next steps in this case, including whether it is appropriate for\nPlaintiff to be permitted to file a Fourth Amended Complaint that takes into account\nDefendants' newly−created procedures before Defendants file their responsive\npleading to Plaintiff's operative Complaint. The Joint Status Report shall specify an\nefficient schedule to advance this action past the initial pleadings and to make progress\ntoward a final resolution without further delay. The Court will review the Joint Status\nReport upon its receipt and set a final case−management schedule shortly thereafter.\n(bb) (Entered: 01/14/2015)\n03/16/2015 58  Joint Status Report .

(Bowen, Brigham) (Entered: 03/16/2015)\n03/17/2015 59  Scheduling Order by Judge Anna J. Brown. Based on the Joint Status Report 58 the\nfollowing deadlines are set: Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is due 04/01/2015.\nDefendants' response to Amended Complaint is due 5/15/2015. If defendants' response\nis an answer, a jointly proposed case−management schedule is due 5/22/2015. If\ndefendants' response to the Amended Complaint is a Motion to Dismiss, then\nPlaintiff's opposition is due 06/15/2015. Defendants' reply is due 06/29/2015. Oral\nArgument is SET for 07/30/2015 at 9:00 am in Courtroom 14A before Judge Anna J.\nBrown. (bb) (Entered: 03/17/2015)\n04/01/2015 60  Fourth Amended Complaint . Filed by Yonas Fikre against All Defendants. (Nelson,\nThomas) (Entered: 04/01/2015)\n04/02/2015 61  Order by Judge Anna J. Brown. Upon review of Plaintiffs Fourth Amended Complaint\n60 , the Court notes Plaintiffs procedural due−process claim (Claim Six) still does not\nallege the denial of any specific protected liberty or property interest. Plaintiffs\nprevious failure in his First Amended Complaint to plead and specifically to identify in\nhis procedural due−process claim the protected liberty or property interest that he\ncontends has been denied was the basis for the Courts dismissal of that claim without\nprejudice and with leave to amend. See Opin. and Order 36 at 28−29. Notwithstanding\nany other challenges Defendants may assert against Plaintiff's Fourth Amended\nComplaint and in the interest of advancing this almost two−year−old litigation that has\nnot yet moved beyond the pleading stage, the Court exercises its discretion and hereby\nGRANTS to Plaintiff leave to file a Corrected Fourth Amended Complaint to address\nthis issue if Plaintiff chooses to do so no later than April 8, 2015. The Court does not\nintend to grant to Plaintiff any further leave to amend his procedural due−process\nclaim. (bb) (Entered: 04/02/2015)\n04/06/2015 62  Fourth Amended Complaint (corrected).

(Bowen,\nBrigham) (Entered: 03/03/2016)\n03/16/2016 97  ORDER by Judge Anna J. Brown. The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's Motion 84 for\nRelief FRCP 60(B), which, although docketed as pertaining to the Court's Opinion and\nOrder 83 issued November 4, 2015, appears, in fact, to challenge the Court's Opinion\nand Order 81 issued on that same day. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion to the\nextent that the Court reconsiders its Opinion and Order 81 . Having reconsidered\nPlaintiff's arguments, however, the Court adheres to its conclusion that Plaintiff lacks\nstanding to seek declaratory relief on Plaintiff's Claim Fifteen brought under the\nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the Court declines\nto alter or to amend its November 4, 2015, Opinion and Order 81 .

The Court concludes additional oral argument on\nMotion 90 is unnecessary so long as the parties have a fair opportunity to file\nsupplemental briefs. No later than 5/27/2016, the parties must file a Stipulation\nconfirming their agreement(s). If the parties reach any additional agreements, they\nshould be included in the Stipulation. No later than 6/23/2016, the parties must file\nsimultaneous supplemental memoranda(not to exceed 20 pages of substance) that (a)\nstate and support their positions as to the effect of Plaintiffs Notice 98 and this Courts\ndecisions to date in Latif on the efficacy of Plaintiffs Fifth Amended Complaint in\nlight of the Motion 90 to Dismiss it, and (b) summarize concisely, with references to\nthe existing briefing on Motion #90, all of their arguments in support or opposition\nthereof. The Court will then take Motion 90 under advisement on 6/23/2016. With\nrespect to Plaintiff's Unopposed Motion 91 to Stay Due Process Claims, the Court\nproposes to deny that Motion as premature with leave to renew in the context of a\nproposed case−management schedule to be set after the Court resolves Motion 90 to\nDismiss. If the parties do not jointly agree with this approach, they must file no later\nthan 5/27/2016, a joint statement expressing the reasons for their disagreement. See\nattached.

For  the  reasons \nthat  follow,  the  Court  GRANTS  in part  and  DENIES  in part \nPlaintiff's Motion. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiff  initiated this  action  on  May  30,  2013.  In  his \noriginal  Complaint  (#1)  Plaintiff brought  six  claims  against \nvarious  Defendants  arising  from  his  placement  on  the  No-Fly  List \nand  alleged  detention  and  torture  while  he  was  overseas. \nIn  his  original  Complaint  and  First Amended  Complaint  (#10) \nPlaintiff brought  four  claims  (Claims  One,  Two,  Five,  and  Six) \nagainst  various  Defendants  sued  in  their  official  capacities \n2  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 3 of 31\n(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Official  Capacity  Defendants  or \nDefendants)  and  two  claims  against  two  Defendants  in  their \nindividual  capacities  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Individual \nCapacity  Defendants) .1  In  Claim  One  Plaintiff  alleged  his \nplacement  on  the  No-Fly  List  while  he  was  abroad  prevented  him \nfrom  returning  to  the  United  States  and,  in  effect,  stripped him \nof  his  rights  of  citizenship protected by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.  In  Claim  Two  Plaintiff alleged  the  various \nDefendants  violated  his  substantive  due-process  rights  under  the \nFifth Amendment  and  his  rights  as  a  citizen under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment  when  the  Defendants  allegedly  \"enlisted  foreign \nintermediaries  to  torture  [P]laintiff  at  their  behest.\"  First \nAm.  Compl.  58.  In  Claim  Five  Plaintiff  alleged various \n~ \nDefendants  violated his  substantive  due-process  right  to  return \nto  the  United  States  by  placing  him  on  the  No-Fly  List. \nFinally,  in  Claim  Six  Plaintiff  alleged  Defendants  violated his \n1  On  October  24,  2016,  this  Court  dismissed  Plaintiff's \nclaims  (Claims  Three  and  Four)  brought  pursuant  to  Bivens  v.  Six \nUnknown  Named  Agents  of Federal  Bureau  of Narcotics,  403  U.S. \n388  (1971),  against  the  two  Individual  Capacity  Defendants.  The \nCourt  dismissed  these  claims  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure  4(m)  for  failure  of  service.  See  Order  (#107)  issued \nOct.  24,  2016.  Accordingly,  only  the  Official  Capacity \nDefendants  remain  in  this  case. \n3  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 4 of 31\nprocedural  due-process  rights  when  they  placed  him  on  the  No-Fly \nList  without  providing  him  with  sufficient  notice  or  opportunity \nto  challenge  his  placement  on  the  List. \nOn  May  29,  2014,  this  Court  dismissed  Plaintiff's Claim  One \nwith  prejudice  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure \n12(b) (6)  for  failure  to  state  a  claim.  Fikre  v.  Fed.  Bur.  of \nInvestigation,  23  F.  Supp.  3d  1268  (D.  Or.  2014).  The  Court \nalso  dismissed  Plaintiff's  Claims  Two,  Five,  and  Six  without \nprejudice  and  with  leave  to  amend  pursuant  to  Rule  12(b) (6). \nId. \nOn  June  27,  2014,  Plaintiff  filed  a  Second  Amended \nComplaint  (#37)  in which  he  re-pleaded  his  substantive  due \nprocess  claim  (Claim  One)  on  the  basis  of  his  right  to  return  to \nthe  United  States  and  his  procedural  due-process  claim  (Claim \nSix)  against  the  Official  Capacity  Defendants.  Although \nPlaintiff  did  not  re-plead  his  torture  claim  against  the \nOfficial  Capacity  Defendants,  Plaintiff  did  add  several  claims \nagainst  the  Individual  Capacity  Defendants,  including multiple \nBivens  claims  related  to  his  alleged  torture.  Plaintiff  also \nadded  the  following  claims  against  the  Official  Capacity \nDefendants:  a  substantive  due-process  claim  on  the  basis  of  his \nright  to  international  travel  (Claim  Two),  a  substantive  due-\n4  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 5 of 31\nprocess  claim  on  the  basis  of  vagueness  and  overbreadth  (Claim \nThree),  a  claim  for  violation  of  his  Fifth Amendment  right  to \ncounsel  (Claim  Four),  and  a  claim  for  violation  of  his  Fifth \nAmendment  right  to  freedom  of  association  (Claim  Five)  on  the \nbasis  that  Defendants  allegedly  attempted  to  coerce  Plaintiff \ninto  being  an  informant  by  offering  to  remove  him  from  the  No \nFly  List  if he  did  so. \nThe  Official  Capacity  Defendants  filed  a  Motion  (#40)  to \nDismiss  Plaintiff's  Second  Amended  Complaint  on  August  8,  2014. \nBefore  briefing  was  completed  on  the  Official  Capacity \nDefendants'  Motion,  Plaintiff expressed  an  intention  to  file  a \nThird Amended  Complaint.  After  conferral  the  parties  agreed \nPlaintiff  should  be  permitted  to  file  his  Third Amended \nComplaint  and  that  Defendants'  Motion  to  Dismiss  the  Second \nAmended  Complaint  should  be  stricken  as  moot. \nAccordingly,  Plaintiff  filed  his  Third Amended  Complaint \n(#55)  on  November  13,  2014.  In  the  Third Amended  Complaint \nPlaintiff  re-pleaded  each  of  the  claims  that  he  brought  in his \nSecond Amended  Complaint,  but  he  added  claims  against  at  least \nsome  of  the  Official  Capacity  Defendants  for  violation  of \nPlaintiff's  Fourth Amendment  rights  on  the  basis  of  an \nunreasonable  search  and  seizure  of  his  telephone  calls,  emails, \n5  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 6 of 31\nand  text messages  (Claim  Fifteen);  violation  of  the  Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance Act  (FISA)  (Claim  Sixteen);  violation \nof  the  Stored  Communications  Act  (Claim  Seventeen);  violations \nof  the  Wiretap  Act  (Claim  Eighteen);  and  a  claim  for  return  of \nunlawfully  searched-and-seized property  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule \nof  Criminal  Procedure  41(g)  (Claim  Nineteen). \nIn  Fall  2014  Defendants  amended  the  Department  of  Homeland \nSecurity Traveler  Redress  Inquiry  Program  (DHS  TRIP)  procedures \navailable  to  individuals  who  had  been  denied  boarding  on  a \ncommercial  airline,  including  those  denied  boarding  because  they \nwere  on  the  No-Fly  List.  Defendants  amended  these  procedures \nafter  this  Court  concluded  in  Latif v.  Holder,  et  al.,  that  the \nDHS  TRIP  procedures  in  place  at  the  time  Plaintiff  filed  this \naction  violated the  Latif Plaintiffs'  procedural  due-process \nrights.  See  28  F.  Supp.  3d  1134  (D.  Or.  2014). \nEven  though  this  action  had  not  yet  proceeded beyond  the \nRule  12  stage,  Defendants  moved  for  an  extension  of  time  to \nrespond  to  Plaintiff's  Third Amended  Complaint  in  order  to \npermit  Defendants  to  reassess  Plaintiff's  DHS  TRIP  inquiry \npursuant  to  the  new  procedures.  On  March  16,  2015,  the  parties \nfiled  a  Joint  Status  Report  (#58)  in  which  the  Official  Capacity \nDefendants  indicated  Plaintiff  remained  on  the  No-Fly  List  after \n6  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 7 of 31\nreevaluation  of  his  DHS  TRIP  inquiry  and  that  Plaintiff had \nreturned  to  the  United  States.  Accordingly,  the  parties  agreed \nPlaintiff  should be  entitled to  amend  his  Complaint  again  to \nreflect  these  developments. \nOn  April  1,  2015,  Plaintiff  filed  a  Fourth  Amended \nComplaint  (#60).  In  his  Fourth  Amended  Complaint,  however, \nPlaintiff  failed  to  plead  and  to  identify  specifically in his \nprocedural  due-process  claim  the  protected  liberty and/or \nproperty  interest(s)  that  he  was  allegedly denied.  Because  this \nwas  a  pleading  deficiency  that  had  persisted  since  Plaintiff's \noriginal  Complaint,  the  Court  granted  Plaintiff  leave  to  file  a \nCorrected  Fourth  Amended  Complaint  to  address  that  issue.  See \nOrder  (#61)  issued Apr.  2,  2015.  Accordingly,  on  April  6,  2015, \nPlaintiff  filed  a  Corrected  Fourth  Amended  Complaint  (#62)  in \nwhich  Plaintiff updated  the  factual  pleadings,  identified the \nprotected  liberty  interests  that  he  was  allegedly  denied  as  a \nresult  of  procedural  due-process  violations,  and  otherwise  re \npleaded  each  of  the  claims  that  he  raised  in  his  Third Amended \nComplaint. \nDefendants  moved  to  dismiss  Plaintiff's  Fourth  Amended \nComplaint  on  May  22,  2015.  Defs.'  Mot.  (#69)  to  Dismiss.  On \nNovember  4,  2015,  the  Court  granted  Defendants'  Motion  in  part \n7  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 8 of 31\nand  denied  it in  part.  See  Opin.  and  Order  (#81). \nSpecifically,  the  Court  denied  Defendants'  Motion  as  to \nPlaintiff's  substantive  due-process  claim as  it related  to  the \nright  to  international  travel  and  his  procedural  due-process \nclaim because  the  Court  determined  Plaintiff  adequately  stated \nthose  claims  for  relief.  The  Court  also  denied  Defendants' \nMotion  as  to  Plaintiff's Wiretap  Act  claim  as  pleaded  in \nPlaintiff's  Fourth  Amended  Complaint.  The  Court,  however, \ndismissed  with  prejudice  the  following  claims:  Plaintiff's \nsubstantive  due-process  claim  on  the  basis  of  Defendants'  denial \nof  his  right  to  return  to  the  United  States  (Claim  One); \nPlaintiff's due-process  vagueness  and  overbreadth  claim  (Claim \nThree);  Plaintiff's  Fifth·Amendment  right-to-counsel  claim \n(Claim  Four);  Plaintiff's  First Amendment  freedom-of-association \nclaim  (Claim  Seven);  Plaintiff's  Fourth Amendment  claim  (Claim \nFifteen)  as  to  declaratory  relief only;  and  portions  of \nPlaintiff's  FISA  claim  (Claim  Sixteen).  The  Court  dismissed \nwithout  prejudice  and  with  leave  to  amend  Plaintiff's  FISA  claim \nonly  as  to  injunctive  relief and  his  Stored  Communications  Act \nclaim  (Claim  Seventeen).  The  Court,  however,  stated:  ~In  light \nof  the  age  of  this  case  and  Plaintiff's  numerous  previous \npleading  attempts,  the  Court  does  not  grant  Plaintiff  leave  to \n8  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 9 of 31\namend  his  Complaint  to  add  new  claims  or  to  materially  alter  any \nother  existing  claims.\"  Opin.  and  Order  (#81)  at  48.  Finally, \nthe  Court  also  dismissed  Plaintiff's  Claim  Nineteen  without \nprejudice  because  the  legal  basis  for  Claim Nineteen,  Federal \nRule  of  Criminal  Procedure  4l(g),  could  not  act  as  a  stand-alone \nclaim but  could  serve  as  a  remedy  in  the  event  Plaintiff \nprevailed on  his  Fourth Amendment  claim. \nOn  November  29,  2015,  Plaintiff  filed  a  Fifth Amended \nComplaint  (#87).  In  his  Fifth Amended  Complaint  Plaintiff re \npleaded  each  of  the  claims  that  were  not  dismissed  in  the \nCourt's  Opinion  and  Order  (#81).  Plaintiff  re-pleaded  his \nFourth  Amendment  claim  (Claim  Twelve),  his  FISA  claim  (Claim \nThirteen),  his  Stored  Communications  Act  claim  (Claim  Fourteen), \nand  his  Wiretap  Act  claim  (Claim  Fifteen).  Plaintiff  also  re \npleaded  his  freedom-of-association  claim  (Claim  Four)  even \nthough  the  Court  had  earlier dismissed  it with  prejudice. \nFinally,  Plaintiff  added  a  Claim  Sixteen  that  he  characterized \nas  a  \"Motion  for  Return  of  Unlawfully  Searched  and  Seized \nProperty  Pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  41(g) .\" \nFifth Am.  Compl.,  at  40. \nOn  January  21,  2016,  Defendants  again  filed  a  Motion  (#90) \nto  Dismiss  Plaintiff's  Fifth Amended  Complaint.  During  the \n9  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 10 of 31\nbriefing  on  that  Motion,  however,  Defendants  filed  a  Notice \n(#98)  that  indicated  Plaintiff had  been  removed  from  the  No-Fly \nList.  As  a  result,  the  Court  directed  the  parties  to  confer  and \nto  submit  supplemental  memoranda  regarding  the  effect  that \nPlaintiff's  removal  from  the  No-Fly  List  had  on  Plaintiff's \nthen-existing  claims  and  Defendants'  Motion  to  Dismiss  them. \nAfter  the  parties  submitted  the  supplemental  briefing,  the \nCourt  issued  an  Opinion  and  Order  (#105)  on  September  28,  2016 \n(Fikre  v.  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation,  No.  3:13-cv-00899-BR, \n2016  WL  5539591  (D.  Or.  Sept.  28,  2016)).  In  that  Opinion  and \nOrder  the  Court  dismissed  Plaintiff's  substantive  and  procedural \ndue-process  claims  as  moot  in  light  of  Plaintiff's  removal  from \nthe  No-Fly  List.  As  it did  in  its November  4,  2015,  Opinion  and \nOrder,  the  Court  also  dismissed  with  prejudice  Plaintiff's  First \nAmendment  freedom-of-association  claim  (Claim  Four)  for  failure \nto  state a  claim.  Moreover,  the  Court  dismissed  each  of \nPlaintiff's  various  surveillance  claims  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment  (Claim  Twelve),  FISA  (Claim  Thirteen),  the  Stored \nCommunications  Act  (Claim  Fourteen),  the  Wiretap  Act  (Claim \nFifteen),  and  Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  4l(g)  (Claim \nSixteen)  for  failure  to  state  a  claim.  In  light  of  Plaintiff's \nprevious  multiple  opportunities  to  amend,  the  Court  declined  to \n10  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 11 of 31\nprovide  Plaintiff with  a  further  opportunity  to  amend  those \nclaims. \nAlthough  Plaintiff  appealed  the  Court's  dismissal  of  his \nsubstantive  and  procedural  due-process  claims  on  mootness \ngrounds  and  the  dismissal  of  his  Fourth  Amendment  claim  for \nfailure  to  state  a  claim,  he  did  not  appeal  the  dismissal  of  his \nother  surveillance  claims  or  the  dismissal  of  his  freedom-of \nassociation  claim.  On  September  20,  2018,  the  Ninth  Circuit \nCourt  of Appeals  reversed  the  dismissal  of  his  procedural  and \nsubstantive  due-process  claims  on  mootness  grounds.  The  Ninth \nCircuit  found  the  government's  actions  in  removing  Plaintiff \nfrom  the  No-Fly  List  were  insufficient  to  overcome  the \nvoluntary-cessation  exception  to  the  mootness  doctrine  and  that \nsome  relief might  remain  available  to  redress  Plaintiff's \nalleged  injuries.  Fikre  v.  Fed.  Bur.  of Investigation,  904  F.3d \n1033  (9th  Cir.  2018).  In  a  separately  filed  unpublished  opinion \nthat  same  day,  the  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed  this  Court's  dismissal \nof  Plaintiff's  Fourth Amendment  claim.  Fikre  v.  Fed.  Bur.  of \nInvestigation,  738  F.  App'x  545  (9th  Cir.  2018). \nOn  remand  Plaintiff now  seeks  leave  to  file  a  Sixth Amended \nComplaint  to  accomplish  the  following:  (1)  to  add  the  Secretary \nof  Homeland  Security,  the  Administrator  of  the  Transportation \n11  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 12 of 31\nSecurity Administration  (TSA),  and  the  Commissioner  of  Customs \nand  Border  Protection  (CBP)  (collectively the  OHS  Defendants)  as \nDefendants  related to  his  procedural  and  substantive  due-process \nclaims;  (2)  to  remove  the  already-resolved  claims  from  the \noperative  Complaint;  (3)  to  plead  additional  facts  relevant  to \nthe  procedural  and  substantive  due-process  claims  that  have \nrecently  become  publicly  known;  (4)  to  add  a  claim  under  the \nAdministrative  Procedure  Act  on  largely  the  same  basis  as \nPlaintiff's  substantive  and  procedural  due-process  claims;  and \n(5)  to  add  a  claim under  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act \n(RFRA)  on  a  basis  similar  to  Plaintiff's  previous  First \nAmendment  freedom-of-association  claims. \nSTANDARD \nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  15 (a) (2)  provides  \"a  party \nmay  amend  its pleading  only  with  the  opposing  party's  written \nconsent  or  the  court's  leave.

Dep' t  of \nthe  Interior,  876  F.3d  1144,  1173  (9th  Cir.  2017).  \"District \ncourts  generally  consider  four  factors  in  determining  whether  to \ndeny  a  motion  to  amend:  'bad  faith,  undue  delay,  prejudice  to \n12  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 13 of 31\nthe  opposing  party,  and  the  futility  of  amendment.'\"  In  re \nKorean  Air Lines  Co.r  Ltd.,  642  F.3d  685,  701  (9th  Cir. \n2011) (quoting  Kaplan  v.  Rose,  49  F.3d  1363,  1370  (9th  Cir. \n1994)). \nWhether  an  amendment  will  cause  undue  prejudice  to  the \ndefendant  is  the  key  factor  the  court  must  consider  when \ndetermining  whether  to  grant  a  motion  for  leave  to  file  an \namended  complaint.  Eminence  Capitalr  LLC  v.  Aspeonr  Inc.,  316 \nF.3d  1048,  1052  (9th  Cir.  2003).  The  party who  opposes \namendment  bears  the  burden  to  show  prejudice.  Adam  v.

The  court's  discretion  to  deny  leave  to  amend, \nhowever,  is  \"'particularly broad  where  [the]  plaintiff has \npreviously  amended  the  complaint.'\"  Cafassor  United  States  ex \nrel  v.  Gen.  Dynamics  C4  Sys.r  Inc.,  637  F.3d  1047,  1058  (9th \nCir.  2011) (quoting  Ascon  Props.r  Inc.  v.  Mobil  Oil  Co.,  866  F.2d \n1149,  1160  (9th  Cir.  1989)). \nDISCUSSION \nAs  noted,  Plaintiff  seeks  to  amend  his  Complaint  to  add  the \nOHS  Defendants,  to  remove  already-resolved  claims,  to  include \n13  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 14 of 31\nadditional  factual  allegations  relevant  to  his  due-process \nclaims,  and  to  add  claims  under  the  APA  and  RFRA.  Plaintiff \nattaches  his  Proposed  Sixth Amended  Complaint  to  his  Motion. \nPl.'s Mot.  (#125),  Attach.  1.  Defendants  oppose  Plaintiff's \nMotion  for  Leave  to  Amend  insofar  as  Plaintiff  seeks  to  add  the \nDHS  Defendants  and  to  bring  RFRA  and  APA  claims. \nThe  Court  notes  Plaintiff's Motion  is  unopposed  insofar  as \nPlaintiff  seeks  to  remove  resolved  claims  and  to  allege \nadditional  facts  related to  Plaintiff's  due-process  claims.  The \nCourt  finds  amending  the  Complaint  to  do  so  would  be  helpful  to \nnarrow  the  issues  and  to  facilitate  litigation of  Plaintiff's \nremaining  claims.  Accordingly,  the  Court  grants  Plaintiff's \nMotion  in  those  respects. \nI.  Addition  of DHS  Defendants \nDefendants  oppose  Plaintiff's  addition  of  the  DHS \nDefendants  on  the  basis  that  Plaintiff's  attempt  to  do  so  is \nuntimely,  would  unfairly  prejudice  those  Defendants,  and  would \nnot  materially  advance  the  litigation of  Plaintiff's  claims.  In \nparticular,  Defendants  contend  the  allegations  in  Plaintiff's \nProposed  Sixth Amended  Complaint  do  not  provide  any  basis  to  add \nthe  DHS  Defendants  as  parties  to  this  litigation.  Defendants \nalso  contend  Plaintiff does  not  provide  any  basis  to  add  the  TSA \n14  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 15 of 31\nAdministrator  and  CBP  Commissioner  because  Plaintiff does  not \nallege  he  was  subjected  to  additional  screening  at  an  airport  or \nat  the  border. \nPlaintiff,  on  the  other  hand,  contends  the  OHS  Defendants \nwill  not  be  prejudiced by  their  addition  to  this  case  even \nthough  it has  been  almost  six  years  since  this  action  was \ninitiated because  discovery  has  not  yet  begun.  Moreover, \nPlaintiff  contends  the  OHS  Defendants  are  relevant  to \nPlaintiff's  due-process  claims  because  Plaintiff alleges  in  his \nProposed  Sixth Amended  Complaint  that  \"OHS  and/or  its  agency \nsubcomponents  including  TSA  and  CBP  have  both  decision-making \nauthority  and  veto  powers  over  watchlisting  policies  affecting \nthe  No  Fly  List  and  the  [Terrorist  Screening  Database  (TSDB)] .\" \nProposed  Sixth Am.  Compl.  1  9. \nAlthough  the  Court  finds  Plaintiff's  addition  of  the  OHS \nDefendants  to  this  case  is  untimely,  Defendants  have  failed  to \ndemonstrate  any  meaningful  prejudice  to  the  OHS  Defendants  that \nwould  arise  from  Plaintiff's belated  attempt  to  bring  them  into \nthis  long-pending  case.  As  Plaintiff points  out,  discovery  in \nthis matter  has  not  yet  begun  and  the  OHS  Defendants'  interests \nto  date  have  been  well-represented  in  this  matter  through  the \nparticipation  of multiple  government  agencies. \n15  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 16 of 31\nMoreover,  the  participation  of  the  OHS  Secretary  and  the \nTSA  Administrator  may  be  necessary  to  provide  Plaintiff the \nrelief  that  he  would  be  entitled to  if he  prevails  on  the \nmerits.  As  Plaintiff  alleges,  OHS  is  the  agency  that  contains \nseveral  of  the  sub-agencies  that  are  involved  in  the  maintenance \nof  the  No-Fly  List  and  the  TSDB  in  addition  to  being  responsible \nfor  enforcement  of  any  restrictions  that  follow  from  placement \non  watchlists.  See  Proposed  Sixth  Am.  Compl.  11  9-11.  In \naddition,  OHS  is  involved  in  the  OHS  TRIP  procedures  that \nPlaintiff  challenges  in  his  procedural  due-process  claim.  See \nid.  11  102-05.  Similarly,  after  an  individual  who  has  been \ndenied  boarding  as  a  result  of  placement  on  the  No-Fly  List \nsubmits  a  OHS  TRIP  inquiry,  the  TSA  Administrator  makes  the \nfinal  decision  as  to  whether  that  individual  should  be \nmaintained  on  the  No-Fly  List.  Id.  1  43.  Thus,  Plaintiff's \nclaims  are  sufficiently related to  each  of  these  actions,  and, \ntherefore,  inclusion  of  the  OHS  Secretary  and  the  TSA \nAdministrator  satisfies  the  joinder  requirements  of  Federal  Rule \nof  Civil  Procedure  20(a) (2).  In  light  of  the  lack  of  any \ndemonstrated  prejudice  to  these  parties,  the  Court  concludes  in \nthe  exercise  of  its discretion  that  it is  reasonable  to  allow \nPlaintiff to  amend  his  Complaint  to  include  the  TSA \n16  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 17 of 31\nAdministrator  and  the  DHS  Secretary  as  Defendants  in  their \nofficial  capacities. \nAs  Defendants  point  out,  however,  Plaintiff does  not  allege \nthat  CBP  has  taken  any  action  related to  Plaintiff's placement \nin  the  TSDB  or  on  the  No-Fly  List  nor  that  Plaintiff has  ever \nbeen  subjected  to  additional  screening  at  the  border  or  had  any \nitems  seized by  CBP.  In  his  Proposed  Sixth Amended  Complaint \nPlaintiff only mentions  CBP  as  follows: \nDefendant  McAleenan  is  Commissioner  of  the  United \nStates  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (\"CBP\")  of  the \nUnited  States  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (\"DHS\"). \nCBP  has  both  decision-making  authority  and  veto  power \nover  watchlisting  policies  affecting  the  No  Fly  List \nand  TSDB.  CBP  acts  as  a  front-line  agency  that \nutilizes  the  TSDB  and  its No  Fly  List  component  to \nscreen  individuals  against  the  TSDB,  including \nPlaintiff.  These  consequences  include  impeding \ndomestic  and  international  travel,  including  through \nthe  outright  denial  of  boarding  any  flights.  The  CBP \nDefendant  McAleenan  is being  sued  in  his  official \ncapacity,  only. \nProposed  Sixth Am.  Compl.  ~ 11.  Although  this  allegation may  be \nsufficient  to  establish  that  CBP  is  involved  with  the  No-Fly \nList  and  TSDB  at  some  level,  Plaintiff does  not  allege  CBP  was \ninvolved  in  Plaintiff's placement  on  the  No-Fly  List  nor  in  the \nTSDB,  that  CBP  took  any  part  in  processing  Plaintiff's  DHS  TRIP \ninquiry,  that  CBP  has  any  authority  over  whether  Plaintiff \nremains  in  the  TSDB,  or  that  CBP  will  serve  any  role  in \n17  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 18 of 31\ndetermining  whether  Plaintiff will  be  placed  on  the  No-Fly  List \nagain.  Under  the  allegations  in  Plaintiff's  Proposed  Sixth \nAmended  Complaint,  there  is  not  any  apparent  remedy  that \nPlaintiff  could  specifically obtain  from  CBP  as  opposed  to  OHS. \nAccordingly,  there  currently  is  not  any  apparent  purpose  for \ninvolving  the  CBP  Administrator  in  this  litigation.  The  Court, \ntherefore,  concludes  it would  be  unfair  to  permit  Plaintiff to \namend  his  Complaint  to  include  the  CBP  Commissioner  as  a \nDefendant  at  the  six-year mark  of  his  case. \nAccordingly,  on  this  record  the  Court  grants  Plaintiff's \nMotion  to  Amend  as  it relates  to  adding  the  OHS  Secretary  and \nthe  TSA  Administrator  as  defendants  in  this  action  and  denies \nPlaintiff's Motion  insofar  as  Plaintiff  seeks  to  add  the  CBP \nCommissioner  as  a  defendant. \nII.  Addition  of Claims \nAs  noted,  Plaintiff also  seeks  to  add  claims  under  the  APA \nand  RFRA  in  his  Proposed  Sixth Amended  Complaint. \nA.  Plaintiff's  Proposed APA  Claim \nPlaintiff  indicates  his  proposed APA  claim \"turns  on \nsimilar  operative  facts  and  legal  issues  as  [his]  Procedural  Due \nProcess  claims,  and  therefore  do  not  substantially alter  the \nnature  of  the  litigation.\"  Pl.'s Mot.  (#125)  at  9.  Plaintiff, \n18  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 19 of 31\ntherefore,  contends  the  addition  of  the  APA  claim will  not \nprejudice  Defendants  and  the  remainder  of  the  factors  relevant \nto  Plaintiff's Motion  to  Amend  do  not  provide  a  basis  to  deny \nPlaintiff the  opportunity  to  add  his  APA  claim. \nDefendants,  on  the  other  hand,  contend  the  Court  should  not \npermit  Plaintiff to  add  his  APA  claim because  Plaintiff unduly \ndelayed  the  addition  of  that  claim,  and,  therefore,  Defendants \nwould  be  prejudiced by  its  addition.  In  any  event,  Defendants \npoint  out  that  Plaintiff's APA  claim  is  redundant  of  his \nprocedural  due-process  claim. \nAs  noted,  the  Court  primarily  considers  four  factors  in \ndetermining  whether  Plaintiff  should  be  permitted  to  amend  his \ncomplaint:  \"'bad  faith,  undue  delay,  prejudice  to  the  opposing \nparty,  and  the  futility  of  amendment.'ll  In  re  Korean  Air Lines, \n642  F.3d  at  701  (quoting  Kaplan,  49  F.3d  at  1370). \nThe  bad-faith  and  undue-delay  factors  go  hand-in-hand  as \nrelated to  Plaintiff's APA  claim.  Plaintiff does  not  contend \nthat  he  could  not  have  brought  his  APA  claim  in  any  of  his \nnumerous  earlier  complaints  nor  does  Plaintiff present  any \nreason  for  failing  to  bring  his  APA  claim earlier.  Although \nthere  is not  any  basis  to  conclude  that  Plaintiff  deliberately \nattempted  to  prolong  these  proceedings  by  filing  numerous \n19  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 20 of 31\namendments  presenting  a  moving  target,  it is  indisputable  that \nPlaintiff's  repeated  attempts  to  recharacterize  previously \nadjudicated  claims  at  the  pleading  stage  has  significantly \ndelayed  this  litigation  and  is  a  primary  reason  why  this  case \nhas  not  yet  proceeded  beyond  the  pleading  stage  almost  six  years \nafter  it was  initiated.  Accordingly,  although  the  Court  does \nnot  find  Plaintiff has  intentionally  engaged  in  dilatory \nconduct,  the  Court  does  find  these  factors,  nonetheless,  weigh \nagainst  permitting  Plaintiff to  add  his  APA  claim. \nThe  Court  also  finds  permitting  Plaintiff  to  add  his  APA \nclaim would  prejudice  Defendants.  In  complex  cases  like  this, \nlitigation under  Rule  12(b) (6)  serves  the  important  purpose  of \nnarrowing  and  focusing  the  issues  to  guide  the  parties  and  the \nCourt  in  the  subsequent  stages  of  the  proceedings.  Allowing \nPlaintiff  to  amend  his  Complaint  repeatedly  to  raise  new  and \nrecharacterized  claims  would  (if  it has  not  already)  turn  this \nimportant  stage  of  the  proceedings  into  a  pleading  version  of \n\"Whac-a-Mole\"  and  would  frustrate  the  ability of  the  Court  and \nthe  parties  to  proceed  to  consider  the  merits  of  the  important \nissues  raised  in  this  case.  Especially because  Plaintiff has \nalready  been  given  numerous  opportunities  to  amend,  it would \ncontradict  the  overriding  direction  in  Rule  1  to  \"construe[], \n20  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 21 of 31\nadminister[],  and  employ[]\"  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  \"to \nsecure  the  just,  speedy,  and  inexpensive  determination  of  every \naction  and  proceeding\"  if the  Court  interpreted  the  policy  of \n\"freely giv[ing]\"  a  party  leave  to  amend  its  complaint  under \nRule  15(a) (2)  by  allowing  this  type  of  repeated \nrecharacterization  of  claims.  Accordingly,  on  this  record  the \nCourt  concludes  this  factor  weighs  against  permitting  Plaintiff \nto  add  his  APA  claim. \nFinally,  the  Court  also  concludes  Plaintiff's  addition  of \nan  APA  claim to  his  Complaint  would  be  futile.  As  Plaintiff \ncandidly  admits,  the  APA  claim  is  largely duplicative  of  the \nprocedural  due-process  claim  that  this  Court  has  already  found \npasses  Rule  12(b) (6)  muster.  Plaintiff does  not  identify any \npotential  additional  remedy  or  other meaningful  advantage  that \nwould  be  available  to  him  if he  were  permitted  to  proceed  with \nhis  APA  claim.  Accordingly,  the  Court  concludes  the  futility \nfactor  also  weighs  against  permitting  Plaintiff to  proceed  with \nhis  APA  claim. \nOn  this  record,  therefore,  the  Court  denies  Plaintiff's \nMotion  to  Amend  insofar  as  Plaintiff  seeks  to  add  an  APA  claim \nin  his  Sixth Amended  Complaint. \n21  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 22 of 31\nB.  Plaintiff's  Proposed RFRA  Claim \nPlaintiff also  seeks  to  add  a  RFRA  claim  on  the  basis  that \nDefendants'  alleged  attempts  to  coerce  Plaintiff  into  becoming \nan  informant  by  placing  Defendant  on  the  No-Fly  List  violated \nhis  religious  freedoms  protected by  RFRA.  Plaintiff  contends \nthere  is  \"little difference\"  between  his  RFRA  claim  and  his \npreviously-dismissed  freedom-of-association  claims.  Pl.'s Mot. \n(#125)  at  6.  Defendants,  on  the  other  hand,  contend  Plaintiff \nshould  not  be  permitted  to  add  his  RFRA  claim because  it \nconstitutes  a  mere  repackaging  of  his  previously-dismissed \nclaims  and  it is  futile  because  it does  not  state  a  viable \nclaim. \nAs  the  Court  earlier noted  with  respect  to  Plaintiff's APA \nclaim,  Plaintiff has  unduly  delayed  asserting  his  RFRA  claim. \nPlaintiff  contends  he  now  brings  his  RFRA  claim because  two \nrecent  cases  (Tanvir  v.  Tanzin,  894  F.3d  449  (2d.  Cir.  2018), \nand  Fazaga  v.  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation,  916  F.3d  1202 \n(9th  Cir.  2019))  indicate  such  a  claim  is  viable  in  these \ncircumstances. \nAs  relevant  here,  the  plaintiffs  in  Tanvir  brought  a  RFRA \nclaim  for  damages  against  various  federal  officials  on  the  basis \nthat  those  officials  improperly  placed  the  plaintiffs  on  the  No-\n22  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 23 of 31\n'  '  I \nFly  List  in  retaliation  for  their  refusal  to  serve  as \ninformants.  894  F.3d  at  452.  Rather  than  consider  the  merits \nof  the  plaintiffs'  claims,  the  Second  Circuit  addressed  a  narrow \nissue:  whether  \"RFRA  permits  a  plaintiff to  recover  money \ndamages  against  federal  officers  sued  in  their  individual \ncapacities  for  violations  of  RFRA's  substantive  protections.\" \nId.  at  453.  After  engaging  in  a  detailed  statutory \ninterpretation  analysis,  the  Second  Circuit  concluded  RFRA \npermitted  such  an  action  for  damages  against  officers  in  their \nindividual  capacities.  Id.  at  464.  Although  Plaintiff  contends \nthe  Second  Circuit's  opinion  impliedly  suggests  the  Tanvir \nplaintiffs'  claim was  viable  on  the  merits,  the  Second  Circuit \nexpressly  declined  to  address  that  issue  when  it \"decline[d]  to \naddress  in  the  first  instance  whether  the  Defendants  are \nentitled to  qualified  immunity.\"  Id.  at  472.  The  Court, \ntherefore,  concludes  Tanvir  does  not  provide  any  support  for \nPlaintiff's  assertion  that  the  government's  placement  or \nmaintenance  of  an  individual  on  the  No-Fly  List  in  retaliation \nfor  refusal  to  serve  as  an  informant  violates  RFRA.  As  a \nresult,  the  Court  does  not  find  Tanvir  establishes  any  new  basis \nfor  Plaintiff  to  believe  his  RFRA  claim  is more  viable  now  than \nit may  have  been  before  the  Second  Circuit  issued  the  Tanvir \n23  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 24 of 31\nI  '  '  ' \nopinion. \nIn  Fazaga  the  plaintiffs were  members  and/or  imams  at  two \nmosques  that  the  FBI  surveilled  using  electronic  surveillance \nand  a  confidential  informant  who  attended  the  mosques.  916  F.3d \nat  1212-14.  As  relevant  to  this  case,  the  plaintiffs brought \nRFRA  claims  against  both  individual-capacity  and  official \ncapacity  defendants  alleging  the  surveillance  activities \nsubstantially burdened  the  exercise  of  their  religion.  The \ndistrict  court  dismissed  those  claims  under  the  state-secrets \nprivilege.  Id.  at  1215.  The  Ninth  Circuit  reversed  the \ndistrict  court's  dismissal  of  the  plaintiffs'  claims  on  the \nbasis  of  the  state-secrets  privilege,  but  the  court  continued  to \nconsider  other  bases  for  dismissal  that  were  raised  in  the \ndefendants'  motion  to  dismiss  before  the  district  court.  Id.  at \n1225-39. \nThe  Ninth  Circuit  did  not  address  any  basis  for  dismissal \nof  the  RFRA  claim as  related to  the  official-capacity defendants \nbecause  they  \"offer[ed]  no  argument  for  dismissal  of  the  RFRA \nclaim  other  than  the  state  secrets  privilege.\"  Id.  at  1246. \nThe  Ninth  Circuit,  in  fact,  expressly  stated it \"d[id]  not \naddress  any  other  defenses  the  [official-capacity defendants] \nmay  raise  before  the  district  court  in  response  to  Plaintiffs' \n24  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 25 of 31\nI  1  ,  l \nRFRA  claim.\"  Id.  at  1248  n.45. \nThe  Ninth  Circuit,  however,  considered  whether  the  RFRA \nclaim  against  the  individual-capacity  defendants  should  be \ndismissed  on  qualified-immunity  grounds. 2  The  Ninth  Circuit \nnoted  the  plaintiffs  were  required  to  present  allegations  to \nallow  the  trier of  fact  to  determine  two  elements:  (1)  whether \nthe  allegedly  burdened  activities  qualified  as  an  \"exercise  of \nreligion,\"  and  (2)  whether  the  government  action  \"substantially \nburden[ed]\"  that  exercise  of  religion.  Id.  at  1246.  Although \nthe  Ninth  Circuit  noted  the  plaintiffs  alleged  a  variety  of  ways \nin which  their  exercise  of  religion  was  burdened  by  the \ngovernment's  actions,  the  court  dismissed  the  plaintiffs'  RFRA \nclaim  as  to  the  individual-capacity defendants  on  qualified-\nimmunity  grounds  because  it was  not  \"clearly established\"  at  the \ntime  of  the  conduct  that  \"surveillance  conducted  on  the  basis  of \nreligion would  meet  the  RFRA  standards  for  constituting  a \nsubstantial  religious  burden  on  individual  congregants.\"  Id.  at \n2  The  Ninth  Circuit  did  not  reach  whether  RFRA  permits \nlawsuits  for  damages  against  individual-capacity  defendants \nbecause  it dismissed  the  RFRA  claim on  qualified-immunity \ngrounds,  but,  nonetheless,  it noted  two  other  circuits \n(including  the  Second  Circuit  in  Tanvir)  had  concluded  such \nclaims  were  permissible. \n25  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 26 of 31\n1247. \nContrary  to  Plaintiffs'  insistence  that  Fazaga  indicated \nPlaintiff's  RFRA  claim  is  now  viable  and,  therefore,  that  he  did \nnot  unduly  delayed  in  bringing  this  claim,  the  Ninth  Circuit's \ntreatment  of  the  Fazaga  plaintiffs'  claims  does  not  speak  one \nway  or  the  other  to  the  viability of  Plaintiff's  claim  for  two \nreasons.  First,  the  court  in  Fazaga  did  not  indicate  a  RFRA \nclaim  on  the  basis  raised  in  that  case  would  be  viable  even \noutside  of  the  context  of  qualified  immunity  because  it declined \nto  consider  additional  potential  defenses  pertaining  to  the  RFRA \nclaim  against  the  official-capacity defendants.  Second,  the \nclaims  in  Fazaga  and  the  case  before  this  Court  are  factually \ndistinguishable;  i.e.,  direct  surveillance  of  individuals' \nactivities  and  communications  in  a  place  of  worship  bears  a  much \ncloser  nexus  to  the  burdening  of  religious  practices  than  the \nactions  alleged  in  this  case.  As  noted,  the  crux  of  Plaintiff's \nRFRA  claim  is  that  Defendants  attempted  to  use  Plaintiff's \npresence  on  the  No-Fly  List  as  leverage  to  coerce  Plaintiff  into \nbecoming  an  informant  regarding  activities  in  Plaintiff's \nmosque.  Plaintiff  alleges  these  actions  ~forced  Plaintiff  into \nan  impermissible  choice  between  obeying  his  sincerely  held \nreligious  beliefs  regarding  honesty,  integrity,  trust  and \n26  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 27 of 31\ncommunity  and  remaining  on  the  No  Fly  List  or  disobeying  his \nreligious  beliefs  and  succumbing  to  Government  coercion  in  order \nto  violate  his  religious  beliefs.\"  Proposed  Sixth Am.  Compl. \n66.  Although  Plaintiff alleges  Defendants'  actions  forced  him \n~ \nto  choose  between  remaining  on  the  No-Fly  List  or  compromising \nsincerely held  religious  values,  Plaintiff does  not  allege \nDefendants'  actions  burdened  the  kinds  of  specific  religious \npractices  that  the  surveillance  in  Fazaga  prevented. 3 \nLike  the  court  in  Tanvir,  therefore,  this  Court  concludes \nFazaga  does  not  provide  any  basis  for  Plaintiff to  believe  his \nRFRA  claim  is  any  more  viable  today  than  it may  have  been  before \n3  The  Fazaga  court  summarized  the  allegedly burdened \npractices  as  follows: \nMalik  trimmed  his  beard,  stopped  regularly  wearing  a  skull \ncap,  decreased  his  attendance  at  the  mosque,  and  became \nless  welcoming  to  newcomers  than  he  believes  his  religion \nrequires.  AbdelRahim  \"significantly decreased  his \nattendance  to mosque,\"  limited his  donations  to mosque \ninstitutions,  and  became  less  welcoming  to  newcomers  than \nhe  believes  his  religion  requires.  Fazaga,  who  provided \ncounseling  at  the  mosque  as  an  imam  and  an  intern \ntherapist,  stopped  counseling  congregants  at  the  mosque \nbecause  he  feared  the  conversations  would  be  monitored  and \nthus  not  confidential. \n916  F.3d  at  1247.  Although  here  Plaintiff alleges  Defendants' \nactions  \"chilled his  religious  exercise\"  (Proposed  Sixth Am. \nCompl.  158),  that  bare  allegation  is  far  too  conclusory  to \n~ \npass  muster  under  Rule  12(b) (6). \n27  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 28 of 31\nthe  Ninth  Circuit  decided  Fazaga.  Accordingly,  as  with \nPlaintiff's APA  claim,  the  Court  finds  Plaintiff has  not \nprovided  any  reason  why  he  could  not  have  raised  his  RFRA  claim \nearlier,  and,  therefore,  Plaintiff unduly  delayed  bringing  his \nRFRA  claim. \nThe  Court  also  finds  permitting  Plaintiff to  add  his  RFRA \nclaim would  prejudice  Defendants.  Plaintiff  acknowledges  there \nis  \"little difference\"  between  his  proposed  RFRA  claim  and  his \nfreedom-of-association  claim.  As  noted,  the  Court  dismissed \nwith  prejudice  Plaintiff's  freedom-of-association  claim on \nNovember  4,  2015  (Opin.  and  Order  (#81)),  and  again  on  September \n28,  2016  (Opin.  and  Order  (#105)).  Plaintiff did  not  appeal  the \nCourt's  dismissal  with  prejudice  of  his  freedom-of-association \nclaim.  To  permit  Plaintiff  to  bring  a  new  claim  that  is \nderivative  of  his  freedom-of-association  claim more  than  two \nyears  after  the  Court  dismissed  the  associative-freedom  claim \nwould  rob  Defendants  of  the  finality  that  they  earned  regarding \nthose  issues. \nFinally,  Defendants  contend  Plaintiff's  RFRA  claim  is \nfutile  because  Plaintiff  fails  to make  a  plausible  allegation \nthat  Defendants  substantially burdened  Plaintiff's  exercise  of \nhis  religion  when  Defendants  allegedly  placed  and/or  maintained \n28  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 29 of 31\nPlaintiff on  the  No-Fly  List  in  order  to  coerce  him  into  being \nan  informant  at  his  mosque.  In  particular,  Defendants  contend \n\"a  'substantial  burden'  is  imposed  only  when  individuals  are \nforced  to  choose  between  following  the  tenets  of  their  religion \nand  receiving  a  governmental  benefit  .  or  coerced  to  act \ncontrary  to  their  religious  beliefs  by  the  threat  of  civil  or \ncriminal  sanctions.\"  Navajo  Nation  v.  United  States  Forest \nServ.,  535  F.3d  1058,  1069-70  (9th  Cir.  2008).  Defendants  point \nout  that  \"[a]n  effect  on  an  individual's  'subjective,  emotional \nreligious  experience'  does  not  constitute  a  substantial  burden, \n.  nor  does  'a  government  action  that  decreases  the \nspirituality,  the  fervor,  or  the  satisfaction with  which  a \nbeliever practices  his  religion.\"  Fazaga,  916  F.3d  at  1447 \n(quoting  Navajo  Nation,  535  F.3d  at  1063,  1070). \nThe  Court  shares  some  of  Defendants'  concerns  regarding  the \npleading  adequacy  of  Plaintiff's  RFRA  claim and,  in  particular, \nas  to  whether  Plaintiff has  pleaded  an  adequate  nexus  between \nhis  placement  and  maintenance  on  the  No-Fly  List  and  the  alleged \nrequest  that  he  serve  as  an  informant  at  his  mosque. \nNonetheless,  the  Court  concludes  it need  not  determine  whether \nPlaintiff's  RFRA  claim  is  futile  because  the  Court  concludes  it \nwould  be  unfair  to  permit  Plaintiff to  add  that  claim  for  the \n29  - OPINION  AND  ORDER \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 128    Filed 05/08/19    Page 30 of 31\nreasons  stated above.  Because  Plaintiff has  had  numerous \nopportunities  to  amend  prior  Complaints  and  the  parties  have \nengaged  in multiple  rounds  of  Rule  12(b) (6)  litigation,  it would \nbe  inappropriate  for  the  Court  to permit  Plaintiff to  start that \nprocess  anew  almost  six  years  after  Plaintiff  filed  this  action. \nAccordingly,  the  Court  denies  Plaintiff's Motion  to Amend \ninsofar  as  Plaintiff  seeks  to  add  a  RFRA  claim  in  his  Sixth \nAmended  Complaint. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  these  reasons,  the  Court  GRANTS  in part  and  DENIES  in \npart  Plaintiff's Motion  (#125)  to Amend.  Plaintiff may  amend \nhis  Complaint  to  remove  previously  resolved  claims,  to  plead \nadditional  factual  allegations  related to  Plaintiff's  due \nprocess  claims,  and  to  add  the  DHS  Secretary  and  the  TSA \nAdministrator  as  defendants.  Plaintiff may  not,  however,  add \nthe  CBP  Commissioner  as  a  defendant  or  add  any  new  claims. \nThe  Court  directs  Plaintiff to  file  his  Sixth Amended \nComplaint  consistent  with  this  Opinion  and  Order  no  later  than \nMay  20,  2019.

Comey, and\nChristopher M. Piehota (collectively referred to as Official \n2 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nCapacity Defendants).1  \nFor the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS the Official\nCapacity Defendants’ Motion (#21) to Dismiss for Failure to State\na Claim and for Lack of Jurisdiction; DISMISSES with prejudice\nClaim One; DISMISSES without prejudice Claims Two, Five, and Six\nwith leave to file a Second Amended Complaint consistent with\nthis Opinion and Order no later than June 27, 2014; and directs\nthese Defendants to file their responsive pleading to the Second\nAmended Complaint no later than July 25, 2014.\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nThe Official Capacity Defendants move to dismiss pursuant to\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) the claims\nagainst them in Plaintiff Yonas Fikre’s First Amended Complaint\n(FAC) (#10) on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to present a\nripe case or controversy in Claims One, Five, and Six; failed to\nexhaust available administrative remedies with respect to Claims\nOne, Five, and Six; and failed to state a claim on which relief \n1\n Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), James\nB.

Piehota is automatically substituted for\nTimothy Healy.\n3 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nmay be granted in Claims One, Two, Five, and Six.2\nOn March 14, 2014, the Court heard oral argument on the\nOfficial Capacity Defendants’ Motion.  At oral argument the\nOfficial Capacity Defendants acknowledged their arguments\nconcerning exhaustion of administrative remedies are no longer\napplicable because Plaintiff exhausted his administrative\nremedies since filing the FAC, and Plaintiff advised the facts\nconcerning exhaustion will be included in his Second Amended\nComplaint to be filed following this Opinion and Order. \nAccordingly, the Court need not address the parties’ arguments\nconcerning exhaustion of administrative remedies.\nThe Court took the remaining issues in Official Capacity\nDefendants’ Motion under advisement at the conclusion of oral\nargument.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff alleges the following pertinent facts in his FAC:\nI. The No-Fly List\nThe FBI is responsible for development and maintenance of\nthe No-Fly List which identifies individuals who are “prohibited\n2\n David Noordeloos and Jason Dundas, the defendants sued in\ntheir individual capacities, have not yet been served and,\ntherefore, are not currently parties to this litigation.  Thus,\nClaims Three and Four are not at issue in the Motion to Dismiss\nbecause those claims relate exclusively to Noordeloos and Dundas.\n4 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nfrom flying into, out of, or over the United States,” or into,\nout of, or over Canadian airspace, by commercial airlines.  \nII. Plaintiff’s Interrogation and Inclusion on the No-Fly List\nPlaintiff is a 33-year-old naturalized American citizen of\nEritrean descent who was a resident of Portland, Oregon,\nbeginning in 2006.  In late 2009 Plaintiff decided to use his\nexperience working for a cellular telephone company in the United\nStates to pursue the business of distributing and selling\nconsumer electronic products in East Africa, and, accordingly,\nPlaintiff traveled to Sudan where some of his extended family\nlives.  Once in Sudan Plaintiff informed the United States\nEmbassy in Khartoum of his presence in the country and of his\nintention to pursue business opportunities there.  Based on\nencouragement from Embassy personnel, Plaintiff began the process\nof obtaining a Sudanese business license.\nOn April 21, 2010, Plaintiff received a telephone call from\nthe Embassy requesting Plaintiff to contact Defendant Noordeloos,\nwho represented himself as an Embassy official.  Plaintiff called\nNoordeloos, who invited Plaintiff to a luncheon at the Embassy\nthe following day to discuss safety during a period of political\nturmoil in Sudan.\nThe next morning Plaintiff arrived at the Embassy and was\nmet by Noordeloos and Defendant John Doe I, who introduced\n5 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nhimself as Jason Dundas.3  Noordeloos and Dundas escorted\nPlaintiff to a small meeting room, shut the door, positioned\nthemselves between Plaintiff and the door, and informed Plaintiff\nthat they worked for the FBI Field Office in Portland.\nWhen he was told Noordeloos and Dundas were FBI agents from\nPortland, Plaintiff requested to be represented by his legal\ncounsel during any interrogation.  Noordeloos, however, informed\nPlaintiff that he could not return to the United States to confer\nwith his legal counsel because Plaintiff had been placed on the\nNo-Fly List.  \nThe ensuing interrogation lasted several hours until the end\nof the business day.  Throughout the course of the interrogation\nNoordeloos and Dundas questioned Plaintiff about the As-Saber\nMosque in Portland where Plaintiff had attended prayer services. \nIn addition, Noordeloos and Dundas questioned Plaintiff about the\nsource of financial support for his business endeavors and told\nhim that sanctions made his business activities in Sudan illegal. \nFinally, Noordeloos asked Plaintiff to be an informant for the\nFBI in exchange for “substantial compensation” and removal from\nthe No-Fly List.  Plaintiff responded he did not wish to become\nan informant.  At the end of the business day Noordeloos\n3\n For purposes of this Opinion, the Court refers to John Doe\nI as “Dundas.”\n6 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nsuggested they resume the discussion the following day. \nPlaintiff agreed.\nThe following morning Plaintiff called Noordeloos on the\ntelephone and informed him that he did not wish to meet further\nwith Dundas and Noordeloos.  Noordeloos became agitated when\nPlaintiff stated he did not want to be an informant.  Noordeloos\nconcluded the conversation by telling Plaintiff:  “Whenever you\nwant to go home you come to the embassy.”  On May 4, 2010, a\nlittle more than a week after their final conversation,\nNoordeloos emailed Plaintiff as follows:\nYonas,\nThanks for meeting with us last week in Sudan. \nWhile we hope to get your side of issues we keep\nhearing about, the choice is yours to make.  The\ntime to help yourself is now.\nBe safe in Sudan,\nDave Noordeloos\nFAC ¶ 28, p. 8.  Plaintiff remained in Khartoum for approximately\ntwo months during which time he noticed he was being followed by\npersons he assumed to be associated with the Sudanese secret\npolice.  He learned from acquaintances that similar individuals\nhad been inquiring about him and his activities.  Plaintiff left\nSudan on approximately June 15, 2010.\nOn approximately September 15, 2010, Plaintiff traveled to\nthe United Arab Emirates (UAE) to pursue similar business\ninterests.  Plaintiff obtained a residency permit in the UAE in\n7 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\norder to conduct business, and he invested substantial financial\nresources provided by his family to that end.\nOn the evening of June 1, 2011, Plaintiff was forcibly taken\nfrom his home by persons he later learned were Emirati secret\npolice.  The police seized some of Plaintiff’s personal property,\nblindfolded him, and placed him in a heavily air-conditioned car. \nPlaintiff’s captors drove him for approximately two hours to a\nbuilding where he was housed in a heavily air-conditioned,\nwindowless cell with only a bed.\nThe next morning Plaintiff was led to a room in which he\nwould undergo the first of repeated interrogations during 106\ndays of imprisonment.  During these interrogations Plaintiff was\nblindfolded while he was questioned in English for extended\nperiods of time.  Periodically Plaintiff was able to peek beneath\nhis blindfold and view the shoes and lower torsos of his\ninterrogators, some of whom wore Western dress.\nThe substance of the interrogations focused on the\nactivities, fundraising, and leadership of the As-Saber Mosque. \nIn addition, the interrogators questioned Plaintiff about\n“circumstances and events that [P]laintiff had disclosed” to\nNoordeloos and Dundas in Khartoum, and the interrogators urged\nPlaintiff “numerous times” to cooperate with the FBI by becoming\nan informant.\n8 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nPlaintiff was subjected to multiple threats and beatings\nthroughout the course of his confinement.  In response to his\nresistance to answering questions, Plaintiff was struck on the\nhead.  Besides being hit on the head, Plaintiff was repeatedly\nbeaten on his back, legs, and the soles of his feet with batons\nand plastic pipes.  When Plaintiff returned to his cell at the\nend of the first day of interrogation, his bed had been removed\nand Plaintiff slept on the floor of his very cold cell.  When\nPlaintiff asked his interrogators on several occasions whether\nhis confinement and interrogation were at the request of the FBI,\nthe interrogators severely beat Plaintiff.\nOn June 14, 2011, Plaintiff took a “lie-detector test”\nduring which he was questioned about whether his “financial\narrangements involved soliciting funds for al-Qaeda,” but he was\nnot asked about the As-Saber Mosque.  That evening the bed was\nreturned to his cell.\nOn June 20, 2011, Plaintiff’s family learned from\nPlaintiff’s neighbors in the UAE that he was missing. \nPlaintiff’s counsel notified the United States Consulate in Abu\nDhabi that Plaintiff had disappeared after being placed in an SUV\nof the type commonly used by the Emirati secret police.\nThe interrogations and beatings continued until July 28,\n2011, when Plaintiff met with a United States Department of State\nemployee named Marwa.  Before the meeting Plaintiff’s captors\n9 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\ninstructed him not to disclose his mistreatment.  During the\ninterview guards told Marwa that Plaintiff was being held without\ncharge as part of an ongoing investigation.  Despite Plaintiff\nlosing approximately 30 pounds since his kidnapping, Marwa found\nPlaintiff was in good health.  Plaintiff “attempted by facial\ncontortions and winks to indicate that he was under duress,” but\nMarwa either did not notice or disregarded the signals.\nThe interrogations and beatings resumed after Marwa’s visit. \nFollowing the meeting interrogators repeatedly told Plaintiff\nthat he would be released “soon” or “tomorrow,” but his release\nwas not forthcoming.  Plaintiff considered refusing food in an\nattempt at suicide, but he was told he would be force-fed.\nNear the end of his detention Plaintiff again asked an\ninterrogator whether the FBI had requested his detention and\ninterrogation.  This time, however, the interrogator confirmed\nthe FBI had made such a request and that American and Emirati\nauthorities work closely on a number of such matters.\n  On September 14, 2011, Plaintiff was told he would be\nreleased that day.  Interrogators took money from Plaintiff’s\nwallet to purchase an airline ticket back to the United States,\nbut they were told Plaintiff would not be allowed to return to\nthe United States by air because he was on the No-Fly List. \nThus, Plaintiff chose to fly to Sweden where, in the belief that\nhe might still be in danger of abuse in countries that condone\n10 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\ntorture, Plaintiff submitted an application for asylum.  Based on\nhis experience with State Department officials in Khartoum and\nthe UAE, Plaintiff does not believe he can rely on the State\nDepartment to protect or to assist him while overseas.\nIII. Plaintiff’s Claims\nPlaintiff asserts four claims against the Official Capacity\nDefendants:\nA. Claim One\nIn Claim One Plaintiff alleges his placement by all\nDefendants on the No-Fly List while abroad prevented him, a\nUnited States citizen, from returning to the United States and\n“effectively stripped [P]laintiff of his rights, privileges, and\nimmunities as a citizen, thereby effectively rendering him\nstateless in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.”  FAC ¶ 55, p. 15.  \nPlaintiff seeks a declaration that “Defendants rendered him\nstateless by denying him his right as a citizen to return to the\nUnited States,” and Plaintiff seeks an injunction requiring\n“Defendants not render United States citizens stateless by\npreventing them from returning to the United States through\nplacing them on the No-Fly List once outside of the United\nStates.”  FAC at pp. 18-19.\n11 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nB. Claim Two\nIn Claim Two Plaintiff alleges all Defendants “enlisted\nforeign intermediaries to torture [P]laintiff at their behest. \nThe foreign intermediaries were directed to torture [P]laintiff,\nand [P]laintiff was tortured in accordance with [D]efendants’\ninstructions.”  FAC ¶ 58, pp. 15-16.  \nPlaintiff seeks a declaration that “Defendants’\nparticipation in the activities that led to Plaintiff’s\nimprisonment, interrogation, and torture at the hands of UAE\nauthorities is a denial of [P]laintiff’s substantive due process\nrights under the Fifth Amendment and a denial of his right as a\ncitizen under the Fourteenth Amendment,” and he seeks an\ninjunction requiring “Defendants not instigate or facilitate the\ntorture of United States citizens in foreign countries.”  FAC at\npp. 18-19.\nC. Claim Five\nIn Claim Five Plaintiff alleges Defendants Holder, FBI,\nComey, and Piehota violated Plaintiff’s substantive due-process\n“right to return to his homeland once abroad” by placing him on\nthe No-Fly List.4  FAC ¶ 67, p. 17.  \nPlaintiff seeks a declaration that his placement on the \n4\n Plaintiff also listed the FBI Terrorist Screening Center\n(TSC) as a participant in Claims Five and Six, but Plaintiff did\nnot name the TSC as a defendant in his FAC.\n12 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nNo-Fly List in a manner that prevented him from “returning to his\nhomeland once abroad” denied Plaintiff his substantive due-\nprocess rights under the Fifth Amendment.  In addition, Plaintiff\nseeks an injunction prohibiting Defendants from preventing\nPlaintiff “from returning to the United States in the event of\nfuture international travel” and requiring Defendant State\nDepartment to “establish information and protocols to assist\nUnited States citizens to return to their homeland who, once\nabroad, are placed in the No-Fly List.”  FAC at pp. 18-20.\nD. Claim Six\nIn Claim Six Plaintiff alleges Defendants Holder, FBI,\nComey, and Piehota violated Plaintiff’s procedural due-process\nrights by “placing [P]laintiff on the FBI-maintained, secret No-\nFly List without informing him of such placement, the basis for\nhis inclusion on the No-Fly List, the means of removing his name\nfrom the No-Fly List, or providing an independent forum in which\n[P]laintiff might secure the removal of his name from the No-Fly\nList.”  FAC ¶ 69, pp. 17-18.  \nPlaintiff seeks a declaration that the placement of his\n“name on the No-Fly List with no notice thereof, with no reasons\ngiven therefor, and with no opportunity to challenge the basis\nfor such placement is a denial of procedural due process under\nthe Fifth Amendment.”  Plaintiff also seeks an injunction\nrequiring Defendants to “provide [P]laintiff notice of placement\n13 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nof his name on the No-Fly List, provide [P]laintiff with the\nreasons for such placement, and provide [P]laintiff an\nopportunity to challenge or rebut the reasons therefor.”  FAC at\npp. 18-19.\nSTANDARDS\nI. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\nWhen deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), the court may consider\naffidavits and other evidence supporting or attacking the\nAutery v. U.S.\nplaintiff’s jurisdictional allegations.   , 424 F.3d\n944, 956 (9th Cir. 2005).  The court may permit discovery to\nData Disc, Inc. v. Sys.\ndetermine whether it has jurisdiction.  \nTech. Assoc., Inc., 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1977).  The\ncourt has broad discretion in granting discovery and may narrowly\nId.  \ndefine the limits of such discovery.   When the court\n\"receives only written submissions, the plaintiff need only make\nprima facie Rio Props., Inc. v. Rio\na   showing of jurisdiction.\"  \nInt'l Interlink, 284 F.3d 1007, 1019 (9th Cir. 2002).  Plaintiff\nhas the burden to establish that the court has subject-matter\nAss'n of American Med. Coll. v. United States\njurisdiction.   , 217\nF.3d 770 (9th Cir. 2000).\n14 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nII. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6), the plaintiff’s complaint must contain\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to\nBell Atlantic v. Twombly\nrelief that is plausible on its face.”   ,\n550 U.S. 544, 545 (2007).  A claim has facial plausibility when\nthe plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to\ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for\nId.\nthe misconduct alleged.    at 556.  “The plausibility standard\nis not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more\nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” \nAshcroft v. Iqbal Twombly\n, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)(quoting  , 550\nU.S. at 546).  When a complaint pleads facts that are “merely\nconsistent with” a defendant's liability, it “stops short of the\nline between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to\nIqbal Twombly\nrelief.”   , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing  , 550 U.S. at\n557).\nThe pleading standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n8 “does not require ‘detailed factual allegations,’ but it\ndemands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-\nIqbal   Twombly\nme accusation.”   , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting  , 550\nSee also\nU.S. at 555).    Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  “A pleading\nthat offers ‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation\nId. \nof the elements of a cause of action will not do.’”   (citing\n15 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTwombly\n, 550 U.S. at 555).  A complaint also does not suffice if\nit tenders “naked assertion[s]” devoid of “further factual\n Id.\nenhancement.”   at 557.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Official Capacity Defendants move to dismiss Claims One,\nFive, and Six pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the ground\nthat Plaintiff’s allegations as to those claims do not present a\nripe case or controversy.  In addition, the Official Capacity\nDefendants move to dismiss Claims One, Two, Five, and Six\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which\nrelief may be granted.\nI. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction\nThe Official Capacity Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s\nClaims One, Five, and Six relating to the No-Fly List on the\nground that Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to\nestablish a ripe case or controversy.\n“Ripeness is one component of the Article III case or\ncontroversy requirement” designed “‘to prevent the courts,\nthrough avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling\nOklevueha Native Am.\nthemselves in abstract disagreements.’”  \nChurch of Haw., Inc. v. Holder, 676 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir.\nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner\n2012)(quoting  , 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967)). \n16 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\n“‘The ripeness inquiry contains both a constitutional and a\nId. Portman v. Cnty. of Santa\nprudential component.’”    (quoting \nClara, 995 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 1993)). \nA. Constitutional Ripeness\n“The constitutional component of ripeness overlaps with the\nWolfson v.\n‘injury in fact’ analysis for Article III standing.”  \nBrammer, 616 F.3d 1045, 1058 (9th Cir. 2010).  “Whether framed as\nan issue of standing or ripeness, the inquiry is largely the\nsame:  whether the issues presented are ‘definite and concrete,\nId. Thomas v. Anchorage\nnot hypothetical or abstract.’”    (quoting \nEqual Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir. 2000)).  “In\nassuring that this jurisdictional prerequisite is satisfied,” the\ncourt considers “whether the plaintiffs face ‘a realistic danger\nof sustaining a direct injury as a result of’” the defendant’s\nallegedly illegal action “or whether the alleged injury is too\nThomas\n‘imaginary’ or ‘speculative’ to support jurisdiction.”   ,\nBabbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l\n220 F.3d at 1139 (quoting \nUnion\n, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)).  “[N]either the mere existence\nof a proscriptive statute nor a generalized threat of prosecution\nId.\nsatisfies the ‘case or controversy’ requirement.”  \nThe Official Capacity Defendants argue Plaintiff’s claims as\nto the No-Fly List do not present a ripe case or controversy\nbecause Plaintiff has never personally attempted to purchase an\nairline ticket or to board a flight to the United States.  The\n17 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nOfficial Capacity Defendants argue Plaintiff relies on “vague,\noutdated, word-of-mouth allegations about the actions of foreign\n‘authorities’” to establish that Plaintiff’s injury due to his\nstatus on the No-Fly List is sufficiently definite and concrete\nto present a ripe case of controversy.  Official Capacity Defs.’\nReply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (#31) at 9.\nThe Court notes, however, the statement of the Emirati\nauthorities that Plaintiff could not travel to the United States\nby air because he is on the No-Fly List is not the only alleged\nbasis for Plaintiff’s claim that he is on the List.  For example,\nPlaintiff alleges Noordeloos, an FBI agent, told Plaintiff during\nthe interview at the Khartoum Embassy on April 22, 2010, that\nPlaintiff was on the List and that Noordeloos told Plaintiff the\nFBI could “take steps to remove [P]laintiff from the No-Fly List”\nif he agreed to be an informant.  Thus, Plaintiff’s allegations\nsuggest Noordeloos not only knew Plaintiff was on the No-Fly\nList, but also that Noordeloos had influence over Plaintiff’s\ncontinued status on the List.\nThese allegations, accepted as true at this stage of the\nproceedings, are sufficient to demonstrate that Plaintiff’s\nstatus on the No-Fly List and the alleged injuries that have\narisen from that status are sufficiently definite and concrete to\nestablish a ripe case or controversy.  The statements of the\nEmirati authorities and Noordeloos may be somewhat dated, but\n18 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nthere is not any evidence of an intervening event that would have\nchanged Plaintiff’s status on the List.  Although a denial of\nboarding may be necessary to ripen a typical plaintiff’s No-Fly\nList claims, here Plaintiff alleges he was told by a credible\nauthority that he is on the List, and, therefore, the Court\nconcludes it is not necessary for Plaintiff to attempt to make\nfutile travel plans in order to establish constitutional\nripeness.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes Plaintiff’s claims that\narise from being on the No-Fly List present a constitutionally\nripe case or controversy.\nB. Prudential Ripeness\n“To evaluate the prudential component of ripeness,” the\ncourt weighs “two considerations: ‘the fitness of the issues for\njudicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding\nWolfson Abbott\ncourt consideration.’”   , 616 F.3d at 1060 (quoting \nLabs.\n, 387 U.S. at 149).  “‘A claim is fit for decision if the\nissues raised are primarily legal, do not require further factual\nU.S. West\ndevelopment, and the challenged action is final.’”  \nCommunc’ns v. MFS Intelnet, Inc., 193 F.3d 1112, 1118 (9th Cir.\nStandard Alaska Prod. Co. v. Schaible\n1999)(quoting  , 874 F.2d\n624, 627 (9th Cir. 1989)).  To establish hardship “‘a litigant\nmust show that withholding review would result in direct and\nimmediate hardship and would entail more than possible financial\n19 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nWolfson Stormans, Inc. v.\nloss.’”   , 616 F.3d at 1060 (quoting \nSelecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1126 (9th Cir. 2009)).  When evaluating a\nclaim of hardship, the court considers “‘whether the regulation\nrequires an immediate and significant change in [the plaintiff’s]\nconduct of [his] affairs with serious penalties attached to\nId.\nnoncompliance.’”  \nThe Court finds Plaintiff’s allegations in his FAC are\nsufficient to establish prudential ripeness.  Plaintiff’s No-Fly\nList claims are primarily legal and do not require the\ndevelopment of any additional facts.  Moreover, Plaintiff would\nsuffer considerable hardship if the Court did not consider his\nNo-Fly List claims because Plaintiff’s alleged status on the No-\nFly List deprives him of the right to board any flight that\nenters American airspace.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes Plaintiff’s No-Fly List\nclaims are appropriate for the Court’s consideration under\nprudential ripeness.\nII. Failure to State a Claim\nThe Official Capacity Defendants argue Plaintiff fails to\nSee\nstate a claim against them.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\nA. Claim One:  Fourteenth Amendment\nIn Claim One Plaintiff alleges:  “By placing [P]laintiff on\nthe No-Fly List and prohibiting [P]laintiff from returning home\nafter his ordeal in the UAE, [D]efendants effectively stripped\n20 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\n[P]laintiff of his rights, privileges, and immunities as a\ncitizen, thereby effectively rendering him stateless in violation\nof the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.” \nFAC ¶ 55, p. 15.  Although it may not be clear on the face of\nPlaintiff’s FAC, Plaintiff clarified at oral argument that Claim\nOne is based on the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.5\nThe Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: \n“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and\nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United\nStates and of the State wherein they reside.”  U.S. Const. amend.\nXIV, § 1.  “[T]he protection afforded to the citizen by the\nCitizenship Clause of [the Fourteenth] Amendment is a limitation\non the powers of the National Government as well as the States.” \nSaenz v. Roe\n, 526 U.S. 489, 507-08 (1999).\nThe Citizenship Clause serves as a “constitutional\nAfroyim v. Rusk\ndefinition and grant of citizenship.”   , 387 U.S.\n253, 262 (1967).  The Citizenship Clause provides the\nconstitutional basis for claims regarding an individual’s legal\nSee, e.g. Vance v. Terrazas\nstatus as a citizen.   ,  , 444 U.S. 252\n5\n To the extent that Plaintiff seeks to state a claim under\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nin Claim One, the Court concludes that effort fails because the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause “applies in terms only to\nactions taken by states, not to those  . . . taken by the federal\ngovernment.”  Russell v. Hug, 275 F.3d 812, 822 (9th Cir. 2002).\n21 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\n(1980)(to extinguish an individual’s citizenship status, a trier\nof fact must find that the citizen intended to renounce his\nAfroyim\ncitizenship);  , 387 U.S. at 267 (citizenship can only be\nrevoked upon the voluntarily relinquishment of citizenship by the\nRabang v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv.\ncitizen);  , 35 F.3d\n1449, 1452 (9th Cir. 1994)(birth in the Philippines during its\nterritorial period does not “constitute birth ‘in the United\nStates’ under the Citizenship Clause . . . and thus does not give\nrise to United States citizenship.”).\nAs an initial matter, Plaintiff is undoubtedly correct that\nthe right to return to the United States is inherent in American\nNguyen v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv.\ncitizenship.  See  ,\n533 U.S. 53, 67 (2001)(citizenship in the United States includes\n“an absolute right to enter its borders.”).  Plaintiff, however,\nseeks to extend the Citizenship Clause not only to protect an\nstatus rights\nindividual’s   as a citizen, but also to protect the \nof citizenship.  \nPlaintiff does not cite any cases and the Court does not\nfind any in which the Citizenship Clause has been interpreted to\nprotect the rights of citizenship.  Instead the Citizenship\n \nClause only defines and protects an individual’s status as a\ncitizen while other constitutional limitations on the powers of\n \nthe government protect the rights of citizenship.  Indeed, this\nwas the role of the Citizenship Clause within the Fourteenth\n22 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nAmendment at its passage:  “[W]hen the Fourteenth Amendment\npassed the House without containing any definition of\ncitizenship, the sponsors of the Amendment in the Senate insisted\non inserting a constitutional definition and grant of\nAfroyim\ncitizenship.”   , 387 U.S. at 262.  Plaintiff’s\ninterpretation of the Citizenship Clause as protecting the rights\nof citizenship would transform the provision from a\nsee id.\n“constitutional definition and grant of citizenship” ( )\ninto a catchall provision protecting every right reasonably\ncharacterized as a right of citizenship contrary to the plain\nmeaning and purpose of the Citizenship Clause.  \nThe Court notes Plaintiff does not allege Defendants have\ntaken any action to strip him of his United States citizenship,\nand, therefore, the Court concludes Plaintiff does not state a\nclaim for relief in Claim One under the Citizenship Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.  Because that deficiency cannot be cured by\namendment, the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s Claim One with\nprejudice.\nB. Claim Two:  Torture\nIn Claim Two Plaintiff alleges all Defendants “enlisted\nforeign intermediaries to torture [P]laintiff at their behest. \nThe foreign intermediaries were directed to torture [P]laintiff,\nand [P]laintiff was tortured in accordance with [D]efendants’\ninstructions.”  FAC ¶ 58, pp. 15-16.  \n23 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nAlthough a claim must contain “a short and plain statement\nof the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), the Court notes Plaintiff fails to plead\nany legal basis upon which he seeks relief in Claim Two.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes on this record that\nPlaintiff has failed to meet the pleading requirements of Rule 8. \nThe Court, therefore, dismisses Plaintiff’s Claim Two without\nprejudice and with leave to amend to plead facts that provide a\nlegal basis for the relief that he seeks in Claim Two.\nC. Claim Five:  Substantive Due Process\nIn Claim Five Plaintiff alleges the actions of Defendants\nHolder, FBI, Comey, and Piehota “in placing [P]laintiff on the\nFBI-maintained, secret No-Fly List resulted in the violation of\nPlaintiff’s Fifth Amendment substantive due process right to\nreturn to the homeland.”  FAC ¶ 67, p. 17.  \n“Substantive due process ‘provides heightened protection\nagainst government interference with certain fundamental rights\n  Mohamed v. Holder\nand liberty interests.’” , No. 1:11-CV-50\n(AJT/TRJ), 2014 WL 243115, at *13 (E.D. Va. Jan. 22,\nWashington v. Glucksberg\n2014)(quoting  , 521 U.S. 702, 719\n(1997)).  Substantive due process “protects those fundamental\nrights and liberties which are, objectively, ‘deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition,’ and ‘implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty,’ such that ‘neither liberty nor\n24 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nGlucksberg\njustice would exist if they were sacrificed.’”   , 521\nMoore v. City of East Cleveland, Ohio\nU.S. at 720-21 (quoting  ,\nPalko v.\n431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977)(plurality opinion), and \nConnecticut\n, 302 U.S. 319, 325-26 (1937)).\nTo establish a substantive due-process claim, the plaintiff\nId.\nmust carefully describe the fundamental liberty interest.    at\n721.  In this case the only infringed liberty interest alleged by\nPlaintiff is his right to return to the United States.\nThe Official Capacity Defendants, however, contend\nPlaintiff’s assertion of such an infringed liberty interest fails\non three grounds:  (1) no court has recognized a right to return\nto the United States; (2) even if such a right exists, it only\nserves to permit a citizen entry upon presentation to a port of\nentry and does not extend to the right to reach a port of entry;\nand (3) even if the right to return extends to more than a right\nto cross the border, Plaintiff has failed to allege his inclusion\non the No-Fly List presents an insurmountable barrier to\nreturning to the United States.  \nBecause the Supreme Court has described the right of an\nAmerican citizen to return to the United States from abroad as\nNguyen\n“absolute,”  , 533 U.S. at 67, the Court finds the right of\na citizen to return to the United States from abroad is\n25 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\ncognizable under substantive due process.6  As Judge Anthony J.\nMohamed\nTrenga’s concluded in  : \n{A] U.S. citizen’s right to reenter the United\nStates entails more than simply the right to step\nover the border after having arrived there.  At\nsome point, governmental actions taken to prevent\nor impede a citizen from reaching the [border]\ninfringe upon the citizen’s right to reenter the\nUnited States.\nMohamed\n, 2014 WL 243115, at *14 (citations omitted).  \nThus, to plead a substantive due-process claim based on a\ndeprivation of the right to return to the United States,\nPlaintiff must allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that\nDefendants have deprived him of every viable means of returning\nto the country.  Here Plaintiff alleges “[a]ir travel is the only\npractical means of passenger transportation between the North\nAmerican continent and Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and\nAustralia.”  FAC  ¶ 17, p. 5.  “Although this may be the sort of\nconclusory allegation that ordinarily is not entitled to\nacceptance as true at this stage of the proceedings, it is,\nnevertheless, consistent with the realities of the modern world.” \nTarhuni v. Holder\n, No. 3:13-cv-00001-BR, 2014 WL 1269655, at *11\nSee also Mohamed\n(D. Or. Mar. 26, 2014).     , 2014 WL 243115, at *6;\nLatif v. Holder\n, 969 F. Supp. 2d. 1293, 1302-03 (D. Or. 2013);\n6\n The Court need not decide at this stage of the proceeding\nthe level of scrutiny that applies to burdens on a citizen’s\nright to return to the United States.\n26 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nIbrahim v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec.\n  , No. C 06-00545 WHA, 2012 WL\n6652362, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2012).\nPlaintiff’s allegations, nevertheless, reveal he has been\noffered a viable means of returning to the United States.  As\nnoted, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Noordeloos told him: \n“Whenever you want to go home you come to the embassy.”  FAC \n¶ 27, p. 8.  Although Plaintiff’s lack of confidence in State\nDepartment personnel is understandable in light of the facts he\nalleges, Plaintiff’s concerns do not establish the option of\nmaking arrangements to return to the United States through the\nembassy is actually unavailable to Plaintiff.  Thus, Plaintiff\nhas not sufficiently alleged facts to support a conclusion that\nDefendants Holder, FBI, Comey, and Piehota have deprived him of\nall viable means of returning to the United States.\nOn this record, therefore, the Court concludes Plaintiff has\nfailed to state a claim against Defendants Holder, FBI, Comey,\nand Piehota that they deprived him of all practical means of\nreturning to the United States.  In fact, the Court notes\nPlaintiff’s specific allegations about the limitations imposed\nupon him by his presence on the No-Fly List are particularly\nSee\nsparse.    FAC ¶ 19, p. 5.  Moreover, because the Court finds\nPlaintiff’s allegations show that Plaintiff has a viable means of\nreturning to the United States, the Court need not determine on\n27 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nthis Motion whether these minimal allegations are sufficient to\nimplicate Plaintiff's right to return to the United States. \nAccordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s Claim Five\nwithout prejudice and with leave to amend.\nD. Claim Six: Procedural Due Process\nIn Claim Six Plaintiff alleges the actions of Defendants\nHolder, FBI, Comey, and Piehota “in placing [P]laintiff on the\nFBI-maintained, secret No-Fly List without informing him of such\nplacement, the basis for his inclusion on the No-Fly List, the\nmeans of removing his name from the No-Fly List, or providing an\nindependent forum in which [P]laintiff might secure the removal\nof his name from the No-Fly List, all violated [P]laintiff’s\nright to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment.”  FAC\n¶ 69, pp. 17-18.\nWhen presented with a procedural due-process claim, the\nCourt must weigh three factors in evaluating the sufficiency of\nprocedural protections:  (1) “the private interest that will be\naffected by the official action”; (2) “the risk of erroneous\ndeprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the\nprobative value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural\nsafeguards”; and (3) “the Government’s interest, including the\nfunction involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that\nthe additional or substitute procedural requirement would\nMathews v. Eldridge\nentail.”   , 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976).  To\n28 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nstate a claim under procedural due process, a plaintiff must at a\nminimum sufficiently plead the deprivation of a protected liberty\nor property interest and the denial of adequate procedural\nBrewster v. Bd. of Educ. of Lynwood Unified Sch.\nprotections.  \nDist., 149 F.3d 971, 982-83 (9th Cir. 1998).\nIn Claim Six Plaintiff fails to state a claim against\nDefendants Holder, FBI, Comey, and Piehota under procedural due\nprocess because he does not identify any protected interest that\nhe has been deprived of by Defendants' official actions.  Thus,\nbecause Plaintiff has not alleged any protected private interest\nthat has been affected in Claim Six, further analysis of\nPlaintiff’s procedural due-process claim is impossible under the\nMathews \nbalancing factors.\nAccordingly, on this record the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s\nClaim Six without prejudice and with leave to amend.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the Court GRANTS the Official Capacity\nDefendants’ Motion (#21) to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\nand for Lack of Jurisdiction; DISMISSES with prejudice Claim One;\nDISMISSES without prejudice Claims Two, Five, and Six with leave\nto file a Second Amended Complaint consistent with this Opinion\nand Order no later than June 27, 2014; and directs these\n29 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nDefendants to file their responsive pleading to the Second\nAmended Complaint no later than July 25, 2014.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED this 29th day of May, 2014.  \n/s/ Anna J.

Plaintiff Yonas Fikre, an American citizen, seeks redress for the denial \nof  his  right  to  procedural  due  process  leading  to  denial  of  his  right  to  travel \ndomestically and internationally.  Plaintiff Yonas Fikre also seeks redress for the \ndenial  of  his  right  to  travel  internationally,  which  denial  prevented  him  from \nPage 2 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 3 of 50\nreturning to the United States when he was expelled from the United Arab Emirates \nand for years prevented from domestic and international air travel.   \n2.  Plaintiff’s allegations in summary are (i) that Defendants sometime \nprior to April 21, 2010, placed  Plaintiff’s name on the “No Fly List” within the \nTerrorism Screening Database (“TSDB”) in order to coerce Plaintiff into becoming an \ninformant/agent  provocateur  for  the  FBI,  (ii)  that  on  April  21,  2010,  during  an \ninvoluntary interview at the United States Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, Plaintiff \nwas urged to become an informant/agent provocateur for the FBI in order to, among \nother things, have his name removed from the No Fly List, (iii) that when Plaintiff \nrefused  to  become  an  informant/agent  provocateur,  Defendants  retaliated  by \ninstigating and facilitating imprisonment, assault, and torture at the hands of the \nUAE  government  during  the  summer  of  2011,  and  (v) that  Defendants  denied \nPlaintiff his constitutional right as a citizen to return home to the United States \nfollowing the UAE government’s releasing him without charge by keeping his name \non the No Fly List.   \n3.  Through  this  action  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  and  for \ndamages Plaintiff seeks (i) a method whereby Plaintiff can challenge the inclusion of \nhis name on the No Fly List and Terrorist Screening Database in accordance with \ndue process procedures, (ii) a declaration that Plaintiff’s fundamental right to return \nto the United States by air, and his right to travel by air, has been infringed, and (iii) \nan injunction preventing the United States from violating the rights specified herein \nin the future.  \nPage 3 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 4 of 50\nPARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff is a naturalized American citizen of Eritrean descent. Plaintiff \nhas never engaged in any acts of terrorism or supported terrorism in any form. \n5.  Defendant  Christopher  Wray  is  Director  of  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation (“FBI”).  Defendant Federal Bureau of Investigation is a bureau of the \nDepartment of Justice responsible for, among other things, selecting individuals for \ninclusion  on,  and  maintaining,  the  No  Fly  List.    The  FBI  and/or  its  agency \nsubcomponents  have  both  decision-making  authority  and  veto  power  over \nwatchlisting policies affecting the No Fly List and TSDB.  The FBI Defendant Wray \nis being sued in his official capacity, only. \n6.  Defendant William Barr is United States Attorney General of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”).   The DOJ and/or its agency subcomponents have both \ndecision-making authority and veto power over watchlisting policies affecting the No \nFly List and TSDB.

As NSA Director, General Nakasone has authority to supervise \nand  implement  all  operations  and  functions  of  the  NSA,  which  include  the \ninterception of wire and electronic communications of those listed on the TSDB.  The \nNSA Defendant Nakasone is being sued in his official capacity, only. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13.  This  is  a  complaint  for  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief,  and  for \ndamages, based upon Defendants’ violations of Plaintiff’s constitutional rights. The \nclaims  asserted  arise  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment \n(substantive and procedural). \nPage 6 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 7 of 50\n14.  Under U.S. CONST. Art. III § 2, this Court has jurisdiction because the \nrights sought to be protected herein are secured by the United States Constitution.   \n15.  This Court has federal question subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n16.  The Court has the authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n17.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because \nDefendants include the United States and agencies of the United States, because this \njudicial district is where Plaintiff resides, and because a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nGeneral Factual Allegations \n18.  President George W. Bush executed Homeland Security Presidential \nDirective-6 on September 16, 2003.  HSPD-6 directed the U.S. Attorney General to \n“establish an organization to consolidate the Government’s approach to terrorism \nscreening.”    HSPD-6  created  the  Terrorist  Screening  Center  (“TSC”),  which  is \nadministered by the FBI.  \n19.  HSPD-6 also directs the Attorney General to consolidate terrorism-\nrelated information and then use it to support (a) federal, state, local, territorial, \ntribal,  foreign-government,  and  private-sector  screening  processes,  and  (b) \ndiplomatic, military, intelligence, law enforcement, immigration, visa, and protective \nprocesses.    The  TSC  thus  houses  the  Terrorist  Screening  Database  (“TSDB”  or \nPage 7 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 8 of 50\n“watchlist”).    The  TSDB  is  a  centralized  collection  of  information  about  listed \nindividuals (i.e. “TSDB Listees”).  The individual identifying information includes \nbiographic and biometric data, such as names, aliases, birthdates, photographs, \nfingerprints, and iris scans.   \n20.  The  TSDB  is  updated  continuously  and  disseminated  around  the \ncountry and to more than 60 foreign governments around the world in real-time.   \n21.  Federal government agencies and foreign government partners draw the \ninformation  supporting  their  nominations  from  intelligence,  law  enforcement, \nhomeland security, embassy, consulate, financial, and immigration records.   \n22.  New  additions  to  the  TSDB  must  include  minimal  identifying  and \nsubstantive information.  The minimum identifying information must be sufficient to \nallow screeners to determine whether an individual’s identity is an actual match to a \nTSDB record.   \n23.  The minimum substantive information must be enough to satisfy the \nTSDB inclusion standard, which the Government calls the “reasonable suspicion that \nthe individual is a known or suspected terrorist” standard.   \n24.  The Government defines a “Known Terrorist” as “an individual who has \nbeen (1) arrested, charged by information, or indicted for, or convicted of, a crime \nrelated to terrorism and /or terrorist activities by the United States Government or \nforeign government authorities; or (2) identified as a terrorist or member of a terrorist \norganization pursuant to statute, Executive Order or international legal obligations \npursuant to a United Nations Security Council Resolution.” \nPage 8 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 9 of 50\n25.  The Government defines a “Suspected Terrorist” as “an individual who \nis reasonably suspected to be engaging in, has engaged in, or intends to engage in \nconduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and /or \nterrorist activities.”  \n26.  The Government adds individuals to the TSDB if their nomination is \nbased “upon articulable intelligence or information which, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances and, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, creates \na reasonable suspicion that the individual is engaged, has been engaged, or intends \nto engage, in conduct constituting in preparation for, in aid or in furtherance of, or \nrelated to, terrorism and/or terrorist activities.” \n27.  The Terrorist Screening Center reviews all nominations to the TSDB \nand  their  supporting  facts.    The  final  authority  to  accept,  reject,  or  modify  a \nnomination rests with the TSC alone.   \n28.  The  TSC  may  consider  an  individual’s  “race,  ethnicity,  or  religious \naffiliation” as well as their “beliefs and activities protected by the First Amendment, \nsuch as freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of \npeaceful  assembly,  and  the  freedom  to  petition  the  government  for  redress  of \ngrievances” as information supporting a nomination to the TSDB. \n29.  The  TSC  may  consider  an  individual’s  travel  history,  associates, \nbusiness associations, international associations, financial transactions, and study of \nArabic as information supporting a nomination to the TSDB.   \n30.  TSDB records are not criminal records.  The TSC includes individuals \nPage 9 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 10 of 50\nin the TSDB who have not been convicted, arrested, investigated, or suspected of any \ncrime.   Inclusion in the TSDB does not require evidence that an individual has \nengaged in any criminal activity.  Inclusion in the TSDB does not require evidence \nthat an individual has committed a crime, is committing a crime, or will commit a \ncrime in the future.  Individuals who have been acquitted of a terrorism-related crime \nmay still be listed in the TSDB.   \n31.  Based on the specific needs and missions of its various partners, the TSC \nannotates TSDB records.  TSC assigns these annotations based on distinct criteria \nfrom TSDB’s overall inclusion standard.  The final authority to accept, reject, or \nmodify a nomination or annotation to a TSDB rests with the TSC alone.  Defendant \nTSC is responsible for including, maintaining, and/or removing Plaintiff from the No \nFly List and the TSDB. \n32.  For the TSA, the TSC annotates TSDB entries in three ways: (1) No Fly, \n(2) Selectee, and (3) Expanded Selectee.  \n33.  The TSC assigns a No Fly annotation when the TSC determines the \nindividual poses: \n(1) a threat of committing an act of international terrorism (as defined in 18 \nU.S.C. § 2331(1)) or domestic terrorism (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2331(5)) with \nrespect to an aircraft (including a threat of piracy, or a threat to airline, \npassenger, or civil aviation security); \n(2) a threat of committing an act of domestic terrorism (as defined in 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2331(5)) with respect to the homeland; \n(3) a threat of committing an act of international terrorism (as defined in 18 \nU.S.C. § 2331(1)) against any U.S. Government facility abroad and associated \nor supporting personnel, including U.S. embassies, consulates and missions, \nmilitary installations (as defined by 10 U.S.C. 2801(c)(4)), U.S. ships, U.S. \naircraft, or other auxiliary craft owned or leased by the U.S. Government; or, \nPage 10 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 11 of 50\n(4) a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and who is \noperationally capable of doing so.   \n34.  TSDB Listees with the No Fly List annotation are prohibited from \nboarding an aircraft that traverses U.S. airspace. \n35.  TSDB Listees, whether bearing the No Fly List annotation are not, are \nalso  subjected  to  intensive  scrutiny  by  the  Government  as  a  matter  of  TSDB \nencounter policy.  This includes the Government subjecting TSDB Listees to lengthy \nand onerous secondary screening at airports; subjecting TSDB Listees to lengthy and \nonerous  secondary  inspection  at  land  borders;  subjecting  TSDB  Listees  to  the \nmandatory search and copying of their electronic devices at borders; subjecting TSDB \nListees to handling codes requiring their arrest or other adverse treatment during \nany encounter with federal, state, local, or private law enforcement officers; barring \nTSDB Listees from access to employment or credentials across federal agencies and \npublic and private infrastructure industries; and subjecting TSDB Listees’ traveling \ncompanions, relatives, and other associates to comparable scrutiny. \n36.  TSC does not notify individuals about their nominations or additions to \nthe TSDB, or their nominations or additions to the No Fly List.  There are no \n“adversarial hearings” regarding TSDB Listee status.   \n37.  The TSDB, since 2006, retains copies of all prior versions of listed \npersons’ records.  TSDB Listees are not permitted to know the history of any changes \nto their watchlist status, or the factual basis for those changes. \n38.  Following 2015 litigation in Latif v. Holder, the federal government \nmodified the redress process for TSDB Listees who are U.S. Persons and who have \nPage 11 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 12 of 50\nthe No Fly List annotation.  If a U.S. Person on the No Fly List files a DHS TRIP \ncomplaint, DHS TRIP (following referral to and consultation with TSC) must inform \nthe individual if they are currently on the No Fly List.  The No Fly Listee may then \nrequest  additional  information,  including  TSC’s  unclassified  summary  of  the \ninformation supporting their No Fly List annotation.  The No Fly Listee may respond \nby submitting information they consider potentially relevant or responsive to that \nunclassified factual summary. \n39.  The redress policy which governs No Fly List annotations (as set forth \nbelow) does not apply to any other TSDB Listees, including those who remain on the \nTSDB although their No Fly List annotation has been removed.   \n40.  The TSC Redress Office has final authority to modify or remove a TSDB \nrecord during the redress process, including by adjusting or removing the No Fly List \nannotation. \n41.  If the TSC chooses to maintain a person’s No Fly List annotation, the \nTSC  must  prepare  a  recommendation  to  the  TSA  Administrator  regarding  the \ncontinuing  No  Fly  List  annotation  on  that  TSDB  Listee’s  record.    The  TSA \nAdministrator  them  makes  the  final  written  determination  concerning  the \nmaintenance or removal of the No Fly List annotation for U.S. Persons.  The TSC will \nthen  technically implement  any  change  to  the No  Fly  List annotation the  TSA \nAdministrator directs.  \n42.  The TSC removing an individual’s No Fly List annotation does not mean \nthat  the  individual  is  also  removed  from  the  TSDB.    The  TSC  alone  remains \nPage 12 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 13 of 50\nresponsible for a U.S. Person’s overall TSDB Listee status.   \n43.  If the U.S. Person remains on the No Fly List following both TSC and \nTSA Administrator review, the TSA Administrator will issue a final order regarding \nthe basis for that individual’s continuing placement.  The final order will also notify \nthe individual with the continuing No Fly List annotation of their ability to seek \njudicial review.   \n44.  Apart from the DHS TRIP Redress process, the TSC periodically reviews \nits  TSDB  listings  and  No  Fly  List  annotations,  based  on  new  or  additional \ninformation  the  TSC  receives.    Pursuant  to  that  process,  the  TSC  occasionally \nimposes or removes No Fly List annotations. \n45.  Nothing prevents the TSC, after removing an individuals’ No Fly List \nannotation, from re-adding the same individual to the No Fly List based on the same \nor similar derogatory information. \n46.  Plaintiff is justifiably skeptical of Defendants’ willingness to engage in \nmeaningful introspection or self-correction.  Famously, in Ibrahim v. Department of \nHomeland  Security,  et  al.,  06-CV-00545,  ECF  701-1  (N.D.  Cal.  Feb.  6,  2014), \nDefendants vigorously contested a Muslim graduate student’s challenge to her No Fly \nList designation and subsequent revocation of her student visa.  Defendants’ actions \nstranded her in Malaysia for nine years.  Following trial, it was ultimately revealed \nthat her placement on the No Fly List was the result of an FBI agent’s error in \nNovember 2004.  He had accidentally checked the wrong box.  Id. at 9. \n47.  Defendants have a pattern of using the TSDB and No Fly List as a \nPage 13 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 14 of 50\nbludgeon to coerce everyday American Muslims into spying on their fellow religious \nadherents and neighbors and becoming government informants.  Presence on the \nwatchlist is deployed as an intimidation tactic and used to coercively justify the denial \nof American-Muslims’ civil rights, such as the right to have an attorney present \nduring law enforcement questioning. \n48.  Along with the experiences of Plaintiff being recruited as an information \nas described in more detail below, public examples of the Government-informant-\nrecruitment phenomenon abound.  See, e.g., Latif v. Holder, 28 F. Supp. 3d 1134, 1145 \n(D. Or. 2014) (an FBI agent told Steven Washburn that he “would help remove \nWashburn’s name from the No-Fly List if he agreed to speak to the FBI”) ; Id. at 1146 \n(FBI agents told Ibraheim Mashal that “his name would be removed from the No-Fly \nList and he would receive compensation if he helped the FBI by serving as an \ninformant”): Id. (FBI agents offered Amir Meshal “the opportunity to serve as a \ngovernment informant in exchange for assistance in removing his name from the No-\nFly List”); Tanvir v Tanzin, 894 F.3d 449 (2d Cir. 2018) (multiple Muslim Plaintiffs \n“asked to gather information on members of Muslim communities and report that \ninformation to the FBI” and “[i]n some instances, the FBI’s request was accompanied \nwith severe pressure, including threats of deportation or arrest; in others, the request \nwas accompanied by promises of financial and other assistance”). \n49.  As  detailed  below,  Plaintiff’s  watchlist  status  and  his  No  Fly  List \nannotation has been the subject of personal harm, contention with the United States \ngovernment, and litigation, for more than a decade. \nPage 14 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 15 of 50\nPlaintiff’s Background, Travel, Imprisonment, Torture, and Release  \n50.  Air  travel  is  the  only  practical  means  of  passenger  transportation \nbetween the North American continent and Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, \nand Australia. \n51.  Plaintiff  Yonas Fikre  is a  naturalized  American citizen of Eritrean \ndescent. When he was a small boy, war broke out in Eritrea, and thus his family took \nhim to Sudan, where he was when the State of Eritrea came into being in 1993. From \nSudan the Fikre family emigrated to the United States. \n52.  Beginning  in  2006,  Plaintiff  resided  in  Portland,  Oregon.  In  late \nDecember 2009, after working for an American cell phone company, Plaintiff decided \nto attempt to distribute and to sell consumer electronic products on the retail market \nin East Africa. He began by returning to Sudan, where some of his extended family \nstill reside. Upon arrival in Sudan, Plaintiff, in compliance with a recommendation \nby the State Department, contacted the United States Consulate in Khartoum and \ninformed  a  representative  of  the  consulate  of  his  interest  in pursuing  business \nopportunities  in  the  country.  The  representative  encouraged  Plaintiff  to  pursue \nbusiness  opportunities  in  Sudan.  In  reliance  upon  the  representative’s \nrecommendation Plaintiff began the process of obtaining a Sudanese business license. \n53.  On Tuesday, April 20, 2010, Defendants’ employee David Noordeloos \nsent an email to Plaintiff, which stated: “Younas, I work at the embassy in Khartoum \nand need to meet up with you on wed 4/21. Can you email me back and let me know \nwhat time in the afternoon works for you? Best, David Noordeloos US Department of \nPage 15 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 16 of 50\nState.”  \n54.  On  Wednesday,  April  21,  Defendants’  employee  Noordeloos  sent  an \nemail to Plaintiff, which stated: “Yonas, I hope this finds you well. I still need to meet \nwith you as soon as possible, can you give me a call and let me know what time works \nfor you to meet? You can email me back or try me at the Embassy or on my cell, but \nplease contact me soonest. Regards, David Noordeloos, US Department of State.” \n55.  On April 21, at approximately 9 p.m. local time, Plaintiff called the \nnumber given and spoke with Noordeloos.  Noordeloos stated that a number of \nAmericans in Sudan had been invited to the Embassy for a luncheon the following \nday in order to discuss how Americans might stay safe during a period of political \nturmoil in Sudan. Plaintiff agreed to attend the luncheon on that basis, which turned \nout to be a false pretense. \n56.  The next day Plaintiff appeared at the embassy. After going through \nsecurity  screening,  Plaintiff  met  Noordeloos  and  another  person  who  identified \nhimself  as  Jason  Dundas.  Noordeloos  and  Dundas  escorted  Plaintiff  to  a  small \nmeeting room and shut the door, positioning themselves between Plaintiff and the \ndoor. At that point Noordeloos and Dundas produced badges and stated that they \nwere FBI agents assigned to the Portland office.  \n57.  Upon being informed that Noordeloos and Dundas were FBI agents from \nthe Portland office, Plaintiff stated that he wanted to be represented by his legal \ncounsel  (Plaintiff  was  then  represented  by  Oregon  attorney  Brandon  Mayfield) \nduring  the  interrogation.    Noordeloos  denied  Mr.  Fikre’s  request  for  such \nPage 16 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 17 of 50\nrepresentation on the grounds that Plaintiff had been placed on the No Fly List and \nthus could not return to the United States to confer with his attorney.  \n58.  Because Dundas and Noordeloos were blocking the door, Plaintiff, who \nhad never before been detained or arrested, felt he could not leave. During the \nfollowing  interrogation,  Noordeloos  and  Dundas  questioned  Plaintiff  extensively \nabout the events, activities, and leadership at the as-Saber Mosque in Portland, \nwhich Plaintiff had attended for prayer services. Noordeloos also questioned Plaintiff \nabout the source of his financial support for his business endeavors in Sudan, and \ntold Plaintiff that, because of the Sudan sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, it was illegal for Plaintiff to engage in business transactions in Sudan \n- a statement that is inconsistent with the advice and recommendation earlier given \nby a representative of the embassy.  \n59.  Noordeloos next told Plaintiff that the FBI desired Plaintiff to become \nan FBI informant to work upon “a case” that was then developing.  Noordeloos stated \nthat, in return, Plaintiff would be paid substantial compensation, be in a position to \nenjoy “the good life,” and that the FBI would take steps to remove Plaintiff from the \nNo Fly List. Noordeloos then asked, “Don’t you love your wife?”, which question \nPlaintiff considered an implicit threat. Plaintiff responded that he did not wish to \nbecome an FBI informant. The interview lasted for several hours until the close of \nthe  business  day.  As  the  day  wore  on,  Noordeloos  suggested  they  resume  the \ndiscussion on the following day.  In order to escape the interrogation room and leave \nthe embassy, Plaintiff agreed. \nPage 17 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 18 of 50\n60.  Defendants’ placement of Plaintiff on the No Fly List and recruitment \nof him as an informant pressured him to infiltrate his religious community as a \ngovernment informant, and to spy and eavesdrop on other  Muslims’ words and \ndeeds—regardless of whether his religious brothers and sisters were suspected of \nwrongdoing—and then to report his observations to the FBI. \n61.  Plaintiff has a sincere religious belief in honesty, integrity, trust, and \ncommunity within his Muslim faith. \n62.  At approximately 8:45 a.m. on the following morning, Plaintiff called \nNoordeloos and stated that he did not wish to meet further with the FBI agents \nbecause he would be wasting their and his time.  Plaintiff reiterated that he did not \nwish to become an informant for the FBI. Noordeloos became agitated and, to the best \nof Plaintiff’s recollection, stated, “Wait a minute! Are you trying to tell me you don’t \nwant to work with us!” Noordeloos then stated, “Whenever you want to go home you \ncome to the embassy.” Plaintiff understood this to mean that Plaintiff’s name would \nnot be removed from the No Fly List and he could not travel to the United States \nunless he became an informant/agent provocateur for the FBI. \n63.  On May 4, 2010, Noordeloos wrote an email to Plaintiff which stated: \n“Yonas, Thanks for meeting with us last week in Sudan. While we hope to get your \nside of issues we keep hearing about, the choice is yours to make. The time to help \nyourself is now. Be safe in Sudan, Dave Noordeloos.” \n64.  Defendants  forced  Plaintiff  into  an  impermissible  choice  between \nobeying his sincerely held religious beliefs regarding honesty, integrity, trust and \nPage 18 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 19 of 50\ncommunity and remaining on the No Fly List, or disobeying his religious beliefs and \nsuccumbing to Government coercion in order to violate his religious beliefs.   \n65.  Because  Plaintiff  chose  his  faith  over  Government  coercion,  he \ncontinued to experience interrogations and the Government-imposed No Fly List \npunishment, which severely restricted his travel including his ability to visit loved \nones in the United States and abroad.   \n66.  Defendants’ actions in leveraging his No Fly List status based on his \nagreement to become an FBI informant caused Plaintiff to suffer emotional distress, \nreputational harm, and economic loss.  \n67.  Plaintiff remained in Khartoum for almost two months following his \nmeeting with Noordeloos and Dundas. During that time Plaintiff noticed that he was \nbeing followed by persons he assumed were affiliated with the Sudanese secret police, \nand he was told by merchants and other acquaintances in his neighborhood that \nsimilar individuals had been inquiring about him and his activities. \n68.  On  or  about  June  15,  2010,  Plaintiff  left  Sudan,  and  on  or  about \nSeptember 15, 2010, plaintiff arrived in the UAE to pursue similar business interests \ninvolving the distribution and retail sale of consumer electronics there. Plaintiff \nmoved to the city of Al Ain in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, where he sought and obtained \na  residency  permit  from  the  UAE  in  order  to  conduct  business;  he  invested \nsubstantial financial resources provided by family members in pursuing that course. \n69.  In the evening of June 1, 2011, persons unknown to  Plaintiff (who \nPlaintiff later learned were UAE plainclothes secret police) invaded Plaintiff’s home \nPage 19 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 20 of 50\nin Al Ain, seized Plaintiff’s computer, phone, and other items, and compelled Plaintiff \nto accompany them in a vehicle. Several of Plaintiff’s friends and neighbors witnessed \nPlaintiff’s apprehension. Plaintiff was blindfolded, placed in a confined space in the \nvehicle, and the air conditioner in the vehicle was turned on high and directed at him \nwith the effect that he became quite chilled. \n70.  Plaintiff  was  taken  to  a  then-unknown  location  approximately  two \nhours’ driving time from Al Ain. Still blindfolded, he was led into a building and into \na long hall where, by peeking down through the bottom of his blindfold, he noticed \nthat he was passing door after door. His guards stopped at one door and put him \ninside a windowless cell where he was lodged. Upon removal of his blindfold, he saw \nthat his tiny cell lacked toilet facilities. His cell contained only a bed and some \nbedding. The cell was very cold because the air conditioning had been set on high.  \n71.  The following morning the interrogations of Plaintiff began. Except for \nthe  one  instance  noted  below,  during  all  of  his  interrogations  Plaintiff  was \nblindfolded. Once blindfolded, he was taken to a room where, throughout his ordeal, \nplaintiff was questioned for hours in English. Periodically during the 106 days of his \nimprisonment  and  torture,  Plaintiff  occasionally  was  able  to  peek  beneath  the \nblindfold and view shoes and the lower torsos of his interrogators.  \n72.  The  primary  focus  of  the  blindfolded  interrogations  was  events  at \nPortland’s as-Saber Mosque, addressing in particular who Plaintiff knew at the \nmosque  who  had  a  “jihadi  mentality,”  what  topics  the  mosque’s  leader,  Sheikh \nMohamed Kariye, speaks about both in public and in private, and how fundraising at \nPage 20 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 21 of 50\nthe mosque occurs and who engages in fundraising there. The interrogators also \nquestioned Plaintiff about circumstances and events that Plaintiff had disclosed to \nNoordeloos  and  Dundas  during  his  interrogation  at  the  embassy  in  Khartoum. \nNumerous times during the blindfolded interrogations Plaintiff’s interrogators urged \nhim to cooperate with them and with the FBI by becoming an informant.  \n73.  When Plaintiff was returned to his cell at the end of the first day of \ninterrogation he discovered that his bed and bedding had been removed. The air \nconditioning remained at a high level, which made the cell extremely cold. Because \nhis bed and bedding had been removed, Plaintiff was obliged to sleep almost naked \non the cold cement floor.   \n74.  During the initial period of his confinement Plaintiff resisted answering \nsome of the questions, insisting that he was an American citizen and needed to speak \nwith his ambassador and with his attorney. In response, Plaintiff’s jailers struck him \non his head and he fell to the ground. Throughout course of his confinement Plaintiff \nwas repeatedly beaten severely on his head, back, legs, and feet with batons and \nplastic pipes, required to assume stress positions for hours, and threatened with \ndeath by strangulation by use of a flexible plastic pipe. One particularly painful \ntorture method his interrogators used was to force Plaintiff to lie on his stomach with \nhis sandals off, whereupon he was beaten severely on the soles of his feet; thereafter, \nhe was required to stand on his feet, which standing caused him great pain. \n75.  On several occasions Plaintiff told his interrogators that the questions \nhe was being asked and the suggestions of cooperation with the FBI were the same \nPage 21 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 22 of 50\nquestions and suggestion he had heard from defendants Noordeloos and Dundas.  \nPlaintiff thus inquired whether his confinement and mistreatment was at the request \nof the FBI. On each such occasion the interrogators responded by beating Plaintiff \nseverely.   \n76.  As noted above, during his interrogations Plaintiff was occasionally able \nto peek beneath his blindfold and view the lower torsos of his interrogators. On most \noccasions, based on their clothing and accents, Plaintiff believes that his interrogators \nwere Arabs. On other occasions, however, Plaintiff was able to view the shoes and \nslacks of several individuals who wore Western dress. Plaintiff believes that in those \ninstances Noordeloos, Dundas, or other individuals acting as representatives of the \nUnited  States,  were  present  and  witnessed  the  interrogations  and  that  those \nindividuals participated in interrogating Plaintiff.  \n77.  All individuals who attended and participated in the interrogation of \nPlaintiff were present with the permission, and were under the physical and legal \ncontrol, of UAE authorities who operated and maintained the secret prison. \n78.  On or about June 14, 2011, Plaintiff was informed that he had to take a \nlie detector test. During the test, for the only time during his confinement, Plaintiff \nwas questioned without a blindfold in place. The questioning during the test focused \nnot upon events at Portland’s as-Saber Mosque but, rather, upon whether Plaintiff’s \nfinancial  arrangements  involved  soliciting  funds  for  al-Qaeda.  Following  the  lie \ndetector test Plaintiff’s bed and bedding were returned to his cell.  \n79.  The interrogations, including beatings and stress positions, as well as \nPage 22 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 23 of 50\nbeing subjected to temperature extremes, sleep deprivation, and humiliation when \nnot being interrogated, continued daily from June 14 through July 27.  \n80.  On June 20, 2011, immediately after learning from Plaintiff’s family \nthat Plaintiff had been apprehended in the UAE (the family had learned of Plaintiff’s \napprehension  from  witnesses  who  observed  the  event),  Oregon  counsel  Thomas \nNelson telephoned and then e-mailed the United States Consulate in Abu Dhabi to \ninform them that Plaintiff, a United States citizen, had gone missing and that \nwitnesses in Al Ain had viewed him being placed in a SUV of the type that is \ncommonly used by the UAE secret police. The consulate officials indicated that they \nwould look into the matter.  \n81.  On July 21, 2011, Plaintiff’s Oregon counsel Thomas Nelson contacted \nRepresentative Earl Blumenauer’s office to request assistance in locating Plaintiff \nand  made  contact  with  staff  member  Emily  Barrett.  Ms.  Barrett  stated  that \nCongressman Blumenauer would look into the situation. \n82.  On  July  28,  2011,  Plaintiff  was  informed  that  a  woman  from  the \nAmerican consulate had arrived to see him. He was told that he was to meet with the \nAmerican consul and that he should not disclose to the consular officer that he had \nbeen mistreated during his detention lest he beaten still more severely. \n83.  On July 28, 2011, Plaintiff, accompanied by two guards, was taken to a \nmeeting room where he met “Marwa,” a consular employee of the State Department \nwho, on information and belief, is of Egyptian extraction. The two guards positioned \nthemselves close to Plaintiff, one on each side. Marwa was dressed in Islamic attire \nPage 23 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 24 of 50\n(a “hijab,” or covering of her hair). By that time plaintiff had lost approximately 30 \npounds of body weight. \n84.  The meeting with Marwa was short and superficial. Although by that \ntime  Plaintiff  had  lost  approximately  30  pounds,  Marwa  stated  that  plaintiff \nappeared to be in good shape. During the interview Plaintiff attempted by facial \ncontortions and winks to indicate that he was under duress, but Marwa either did \nnot notice or disregarded these signals. \n85.  Marwa questioned Plaintiff regarding what offense he had been charged \nwith, whereupon Plaintiff asked the two guards what he had been charged with. The \nguards stated that Plaintiff was being held without charge and that the authorities \nwere merely conducting an investigation.  \n86.  Following the meeting with Marwa, Plaintiff was returned to his cell \nand the interrogations and torture resumed. Marwa’s visit was the only United States \nconsular visit during Plaintiff’s 106 days of detention and torture; the consulate did \nnot visit or make any contact with Plaintiff during his remaining 49 days of his \nconfinement and torture, nor did it provide any assistance to Plaintiff when he was \ndeported from the UAE. \n87.  Following  the  meeting  with  Marwa,  Plaintiff  became  despondent. \nBecause the consul’s office had sent a Muslim woman wearing a hijab to interact with \nthe prison authorities and the two guards, Plaintiff came to believe that, because of \nhis black skin, the United States had “thrown [him] away.” He consequently began \nto consider refusing food in an attempt at suicide, but was told that he would be force-\nPage 24 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 25 of 50\nfed if necessary. \n88.  Toward  the  end  of  his  interrogation  Plaintiff  again  inquired  of  his \ninterrogator whether the FBI had requested that he be detained and interrogated. \nThis time, instead of being beaten, the interrogator stated that indeed the FBI had \nmade such a request and that the American and Emerati authorities work closely on \na number of such matters. \n89.  On September 14, 2011, Plaintiff was told that he would be released that \nday but would have to leave the UAE and stay out for at least a year. His belongings \nwere returned to him and money from his wallet was taken to buy him a plane ticket \nback to the United States while Plaintiff remained in custody. Such a ticket was \npurchased from a travel agency; however, when the jailer took the ticket to the airport \nto obtain a boarding pass, the boarding pass was refused on the grounds that Plaintiff \nwas on the No Fly List. \n90.  Plaintiff’s custodian was visibly upset because he could not board the \nflight out of the UAE, and asked Plaintiff, “What kind of country would refuse a \ncitizen’s return to his own country?” or words to that effect. The custodian then \nreiterated that Plaintiff could not stay in the UAE, and therefore would have to go \nsomewhere else, and asked where Plaintiff wished to be sent. Because Plaintiff had \na relative in Sweden, Plaintiff indicated that he should be sent there. Therefore, the \ncustodian took more money from Plaintiff’s wallet and arranged the purchase of a \nticket to Stockholm, Sweden. This time a boarding pass was issued for Plaintiff. \n91.  The United States consulate in the UAE knew or should have known \nPage 25 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 26 of 50\nthat Plaintiff would be deported upon his release from prison, but the consulate took \nno action to provide assistance to Plaintiff upon his release. \n92.  Plaintiff arrived in Sweden traumatized, with few financial and other \nresources, and clothing entirely inappropriate for the Scandinavian weather and \nclimate. \n93.  Shortly after arriving in Stockholm Plaintiff contacted the airline that \nhad refused to issue him a boarding pass in the UAE and discussed his situation with \nthem. The representative he spoke with confirmed that he had been denied boarding \non the flight from the UAE to the United States but stated that she could not provide \nany reasons for such refusal. Plaintiff then requested a refund of the ticket price, but \nthe representative stated that because the ticket had been purchased through a travel \nagency in the UAE he would have to get the refund (if any) from that travel agency. \n94.  To date Plaintiff has been unable to obtain a refund for the unused ticket \nfrom the UAE to the United States.  \n95.  In addition to being stranded with few resources in a foreign country, \nbeing placed on the No Fly List resulted in Plaintiff’s losing virtually all of his rights \nas a citizen of the United States - he could not return home to enjoy the rights, \nprivileges  and  immunities  of  citizenship.  Moreover,  his  experience  with  State \nDepartment officials in Khartoum and Abu Dhabi demonstrated to him that the State \nDepartment would neither protect nor assist him while overseas; rather, it would \nactively work to his detriment. \n96.  Nationals of one country are allowed to visit foreign countries for only \nPage 26 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 27 of 50\nlimited periods of time before they have to leave the country they are visiting; in the \ncase of Sweden and other Schengen Agreement countries the maximum stay is for 90 \ndays for holders of United States passports unless special arrangements are made, \nsuch as requesting asylum. \n97.  Upon arriving in Sweden and being unable to return home, Plaintiff \ncontacted a Swedish attorney, Advokat Hans Bredberg, who suggested that Plaintiff \nseek protective asylum in that country. Believing that the United States, through the \nFBI, was responsible for his detention and torture in Abu Dhabi and that he may still \nbe in danger of abuse in countries that condone torture (including the United States), \nPlaintiff submitted an application for asylum to the authorities in Sweden. \n98.  On April 18, 2012, a press conference was held in Advokat Bredberg’s \noffice in Stockholm during which Plaintiff’s ordeal was disclosed publicly. Less than \ntwo weeks later, on May 1, 2012, Plaintiff and two other individuals were indicted in \nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Docket No. \n3:12-cr-06189-JAH, for “conspiracy to structure” monetary transfers from his family \nto him in the UAE between April 14, 2010, and April 19, 2010, which funds Plaintiff \nused to attempt to start his business. On information and belief, this indictment was \nin retaliation for Plaintiff’s publicizing of his ordeal through the April 18, 2012 press \nconference in Stockholm, and based at least in part upon information the United \nStates obtained from the interview at the United States Embassy in Khartoum, from \nPlaintiff’s 106 days of interrogation and torture in the UAE, and from the electronic \nsurveillance of Plaintiff.  \nPage 27 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 28 of 50\n99.  Sometime in the fall of 2013 counsel for Defendants contacted counsel \nfor Plaintiff and suggested that if Plaintiff wished to return to the United States he \nshould  visit  the  United  States  embassy  in  Stockholm  to  make  necessary \narrangements.  After  conferring  with  Plaintiff  in  Stockholm,  Plaintiff’s \nrepresentatives informed Defendants’ counsel that Plaintiff was apprehensive about \nentering  the  embassy  grounds  and  that  Plaintiff  would,  under  the  present \ncircumstances, consider returning if the United States (1) guaranteed  Plaintiff’s \nsafety from extra-judicial actions, and (2) provided adequate assurances that Plaintiff \ncould leave the United States once he returned. Counsel for Defendants indicated \nthat the United States would not provide such guarantees and assurances. \n100.  In  early  November  2013  Plaintiff  filed  with  the  Department  of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”) a Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (“TRIP”) request \nand was assigned a redress number. By letter dated January 23, 2014, DHS informed \nPlaintiff that “It has been determined that no changes or corrections are warranted \nat this time” and suggesting that Plaintiff might wish to take an administrative \nappeal from this decision. Because it was unclear from the DHS letter whether \nPlaintiff was then on the No Fly List, and thus it was unclear whether Plaintiff was \naggrieved by this decision, by letter dated February 24, 2014, Plaintiff requested \nclarification and a stay pending resolution of this issue and the resolution of the \ncurrent litigation. By letter dated March 11, 2014, DHS replied that an extension to \ntake an appeal would be granted to April 22, 2014. Plaintiff then abandoned his \nefforts with DHS.  \nPage 28 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 29 of 50\n101.  Because of  the stigma Plaintiff’s No Fly List placement imposed, Fikre’s \nformer wife and her family placed tremendous pressure on their marriage.  The \nformer wife, whenever she traveled, would be asked about Fikre.  The former wife \nand the family feared that the stigma Fikre’s listing inflicted would continue to affect \ntheir standing in the community and with government, absent a divorce.  Because of \nthe listing, Fikre’s former wife insisted on a divorce, her father asked Fikre and his \nfamily for a divorce.  And in accordance with community practices and mores, a local \nimam got involved in the matter to mediate the marital dispute caused by Fikre’s No \nFly List placement. \n102.   Because of the fear and stigma created by Fikre’s placement on the No \nFly List, , Plaintiff’s wife sought and received a divorce from Plaintiff.  \n103.  Early in 2015 Plaintiff’s application for asylum in Sweden was denied.  \n104.  On February 12, 2015, the DHS by letter informed Plaintiff that DHS \nhad on its own motion “reevaluated” Plaintiff’s prior TRIP inquiry and informed \nPlaintiff that he was on the No Fly List because he had been “identified as an \nindividual who ‘may be a threat to civil aviation or national security.’” The DHS \nprovided  no  factual  bases  to  support  this  conclusion,  and  requested  Plaintiff’s \nresponse. By a letter dated February 19, 2015, Plaintiff categorically denied that he \nwas or is a threat and stated that the bare conclusion contained in the DHS latter of \nFebruary  12,  2015,  prevented  Plaintiff  from  providing  a  meaningful  response; \nconsequently, Plaintiff asserted that the February 12, 2015, letter violated Plaintiff’s \ndue process rights. By a “Decision and Order” dated March 9, 2015, the DHS indicated \nPage 29 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 30 of 50\nthat Plaintiff’s name would remain on the No Fly List. \n105.  On February 14, 2015, the Swedish government transported Plaintiff to \nPortland, Oregon, by private jet.  \nPlaintiff’s Surveillance, Indictment, and Dismissal \n106.  In 2010, while he was inside the United States, Plaintiff and his brother \nDawit Woldehawariat - both US citizens - worked together to set up a lawful business \nventure abroad. In furtherance of this objective, Plaintiff and his brother discussed \nthe parameters of the business venture they envisioned and the financial resources \nnecessary to execute their plan.  These discussions occurred by telephone, email, and \ntext message. \n107.  Unbeknownst at the time to either Plaintiff or his brother, Defendants \nwere intercepting and/or acquiring the content of Plaintiff’s telephone calls, his text \nmessages, and his emails. Plaintiff now knows this because the United States has \nconfirmed, through Department of Justice filings submitted in a since-dismissed \nprosecution against Plaintiff in the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of California, that it intercepted the contents of Plaintiff’s telephone calls, \nemails,  and  text  messages.  See  U.S. District  Court  for  the  Southern District  of \nCalifornia, Docket No. 3:12-cr-06189-JAH, Doc. # 10. \n108.  These interceptions and/or acquisitions of Plaintiff’s telephone calls, \nemails, and text messages were not conducted pursuant to a warrant and were not \nsupported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion. \n109.  On  information  and  belief,  the  information  upon  which  defendants \nPage 30 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 31 of 50\ncaused Plaintiff to meet with defendant FBI agents Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason \nDundas) in Khartoum and upon which Defendants caused the UAE to imprison and \ntorture Plaintiff was derived from illegal surveillance and searches.  \n110.  On  information  and  belief,  information  derived  from  the  electronic \nsurveillance of Plaintiff was willfully, knowingly, and recklessly disseminated for the \nunlawful purpose of interrogating Plaintiff without counsel and coercing Plaintiff to \nturn informant and then to cause his torture by proxy in the UAE. \n111.  On information and belief, the information derived from the electronic \nsurveillance  of  Plaintiff  was  disseminated  to  several  agencies  and  foreign \ngovernments  including  but  not  limited  to  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency,  the \nNational Security Council, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity,  the  Department  of  Justice/Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation,  the  US \nAttorney’s Office for the District of Oregon, the Department of the Treasury and the \nNational Security Agency, and the United Arab Emirates. \nFikre’s Continued Suffering Due to His Placement on the Watchlist \n112.  Plaintiff  has  suffered  mistreatment  at  the  hands  of  Defendants \nincluding, but not limited to, being placed on the Terrorist Screening Database and \nits  No  Fly  List  annotation  without  notice  of  the  factual  bases  therefor  or  the \nopportunity to be heard, denial of legal counsel, false arrest and false imprisonment, \nassault and battery, torture, violation of his right to freedom of association, illegal \nsurveillance, violation of his right to privacy, and violation of his substantive and \nprocedural due process rights. Plaintiff intends to continue to attempt to exercise his \nPage 31 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 32 of 50\nrights, including the right to legal counsel, to travel by air, and his substantive and \nprocedural due process rights.  Based upon defendants’ past misconduct Plaintiff has \na reasonable fear of further future mistreatment by defendants and other agents of \nthe United States. \n113.  On  May  6,  2015,  during  the  course  of  this  litigation,  Defendants \ninformed Plaintiff that the Terrorist Screening Center had removed him from the No \nFly List.  See Dkt. 98. \n114.  In 2016, Fikre undertook the Islamic religious pilgrimage known as \nhajj—a one-per-lifetime obligation Muslims have to travel to Mecca to perform certain \nrituals.  It is a communal ritual, and like other American Muslims, Fikre booked his \nhajj trip through a travel company that specializes in organizing trips to Mecca.   \n115.  Fikre’s itinerary to Mecca had him traveling with about 20-25 Muslims \nin the Seattle-area community to Chicago, where they would meet up with other \nMuslims from across the country to travel altogether—in a group of about 60-80—to \nMecca.   \n116.  When Fikre traveled to the airport in Seattle to begin his trip, he went \nalone and very early to get his boarding pass.  He expected Defendants to make it \nonerous for him to obtain his boarding pass.  And Defendants did require him to wait \nfor a ticketing agent to call Defendants for an individualized permission to print \nFikre’s boarding pass.  His boarding pass was stamped as SSSS, which indicates a \nperson’s TSDB status. \n117.  Though  Fikre  got  his  boarding  pass  alone  to  hide  from  others  his \nPage 32 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 33 of 50\nwatchlist status, Fikre could not do the same when Defendant TSA screened him to \nenter the sterile area of the airport. Fikre went through the security line alongside \nthe 20-25 community members who were part of his hajj group.  As he proceeded \nthrough security, Defendant TSA—in accordance with his TSDB status—subjected \nhim to invasive and disparate screening.  His co-travelers saw his security screening, \nunderstood that Defendant TSA viewed him as a physical threat, and feared him as \na result.   \n118.  When Fikre and his group arrived at their gate, inside the secure area \nof the airport, there were 3-5 five agents with a swab machine—used to detect \nchemicals on a person’s hands, clothes, or belongings—and a metal detector.  The \nagents inspected each person’s boarding pass and ID as they entered the jetbridge, \nand when Fikre approached, the agents directed him to step aside1.  He was, again, \ninvasively searched, patted down, swabbed, and otherwise inspected in full view of \nhis hajj group and other passengers.   \n119.  Because Defendants’ watchlisting system is so focused on the Muslim \ncommunity, many of the TSDB-related consequences Defendants imposed on Fikre \nare common knowledge among American Muslims.  As a result, some of Plaintiff’s co-\ntravelers deduced his TSDB status from how Defendants treated him.   \n120.  In response to the visible consequences of Fikre’s TSDB status at the \nSeattle airport, many individuals in his hajj group stopped speaking with him and \n                                            \n1 These gate screenings are conducted only against a subset of persons in the TSDB and for no other reason. \nPage 33 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 34 of 50\notherwise sought to avoid any contact with him for the remainder of the trip.  His co-\ntravelers feared that, if they were to associate with Fikre, they would be subject to \nthe same treatment.   \n121.  Because Fikre’s TSDB status was discernable to members of the public, \nhis co-travelers, and fellow passengers, Fikre was humiliated and could discern fear \nand revulsion of him from those who witnessed how Defendants treated Fikre.   \n122.  When Fikre and his co-travelers landed in Chicago, his hajj group had \nto get new boarding passes in order to get to their international flight to Mecca.  After \ndeplaning, the travel group organizers convened everyone and proceeded to the \nticketing counter.   \n123.  When Fikre presented his information for a boarding pass, the ticketing \nagent  asked  him  to  step  aside.    The  ticketing  agent  called  Defendants  to  get \nindividualized permission to print out Fikre’s boarding pass.  Fikre’s co-travelers \ncould see that Defendants required Fikre to obtain special permission to fly via a \nmore onerous process.  \n124.  Fikre’s co-travelers, particularly some who had witnessed how he was \ntreated in Seattle’s airport, asked him why he was not getting his boarding pass and \nwhy he was being treated in this manner.  These co-travelers could tell that the \nfederal government believed Fikre was dangerous.   \n125.  Because of the delay in getting his boarding pass, Fikre’s hajj group \nproceeded to the security line before him.  As Fikre’s co-travelers went through the \nsecurity line, the organizers gathered everyone up to wait for Fikre just past the \nPage 34 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 35 of 50\nsecurity line so that, once Defendants completed their invasive searches of Fikre and \nhis property, everyone could proceed to the gate together.   \n126.  When Fikre finally got his boarding pass to board his international flight \nfrom Chicago to Mecca, it was stamped with SSSS—the physical manifestation of \nFikre’s TSDB status.  When he presented himself at the security line, Defendant TSA \nsubjected him to the same invasive screening of his person and his bags that he had \ngone through in Seattle.  This time, his whole hajj group could see how he was being \ntreated.  And after he rejoined the group, some individuals were in tears about what \nthey saw Defendants doing to Fikre.  Others told Fikre that they had been praying \nfor his safety.  \n127.   Some, however, were alarmed that Fikre was in their hajj group and \nthat they would be traveling with him.  Some individuals who had spoken warmly \nwith Fikre prior to witnessing how Defendants treated him subsequently shunned \nand avoided him.  The tangible consequences of Fikre’s TSDB status made him an \noutcast in his hajj group.   \n128.  When Fikre’s hajj group arrived at the gate and began boarding their \nflight, an airline gate agent scanned his boarding pass in front of others and, in \nArabic, told his colleague that Fikre had been “red-flagged.”  The gate agent then \ntreated  Fikre  with  suspicion  and  reacted  in  this  manner  because  Defendants \ndisseminated Fikre’s TSDB status to them.  Fikre’s co-travelers, including some who \nknew Arabic, could tell that Defendant TSA believed Fikre was a threat and decided \nto subject him to more onerous processes.   \nPage 35 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 36 of 50\n129.  When Fikre arrived in Saudi Arabia and customs agents scanned his \npassport, he heard the agents tell each other that Fikre had been “red-flagged.”  This \nwas in front of many in his hajj group.  Rather than proceed through customs as \neveryone else in his hajj group, Fikre was detained by Saudi customs officials for \napproximately four to five hours because of the TSDB status Defendants imposed on \nhim and disseminated to Saudi Arabia.   \n130.  To protest his detention, some members of his hajj group stayed in the \narea immediately past the customs checkpoint—though almost all of his co-travelers \nhad left on a bus to their hotel.   \n131.  When Fikre finally cleared customs and rejoined the members of his hajj \ngroup that had stayed behind, he was greeted with hugs and expressions of grave \nconcern for his safety.   \n132.  Fikre’s treatment at the airports in Seattle, Chicago, and Saudi Arabia \non his way to Mecca disclosed to his co-travelers the stigmatizing label Defendants \nimposed on Fikre.  His co-travelers feared Fikre and avoided him because of his status \non  the  watchlist.    And  because  Fikre’s  co-travelers  were  part  of  his  religious \ncommunity,  the  stigma  of  his  TSDB  status  spread  throughout  his  religious \ncommunity. \n133.  During his weeks-long hajj trip, almost every person in his group would \nrefuse to associate or talk with Fikre in any manner.  Fikre’s co-travelers did not \nwant to serve him food or water and looked at Fikre with fear and disgust.  Fikre’s \nwatchlist status caused his co-travelers to ostracize him. \nPage 36 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 37 of 50\n134.  During the hajj group’s return trip to the United States, Fikre and \nseveral co-travelers were subject to secondary screening.  One traveler told Fikre that \nthe extra screening that the traveler was dealing with were Fikre’s fault.  The \ntraveler blamed his travel difficulties on his association, via the hajj group, with \nFikre.  And Defendants watchlisting system does, in fact, target people who associate \nwith listees like Fikre. \n135.  Even after entering the United States, Defendants imposed on Fikre \nseparate and more onerous processes that further stigmatized him,  Fikre overheard \nDefendants’ agent instructing, in accordance with Fikre’s TSDB status, a ticketing \nagent to make Fikre miss his scheduled connecting flight home. Because of this \ninstruction, Fikre could not continue home with his co-travelers as his hajj group had \nplanned.  Co-travelers presumed that Defendants had detained or arrested Fikre.     \n136.  In his community, as a result of Defendants’ decision to impose on him \na TSDB status, fellow congregants have opposed him leading prayer or calling the \nadhan—an Islamic recitation that signals to congregants the start of prayer.   \n137.  Some  in  the  Muslim  community  believe,  incorrectly,  that  Fikre’s \nremoval from the No Fly List was compensation for government informant work. \n138.  When Fikre has tried to start conversations with fellow congregants in \nhis religious community, people do not want to share their names with Fikre or tell \nFikre what their jobs are.  This is attributable to the stigma of Fikre’s watchlist \nstatus. \n139.  After Fikre took over ownership of a restaurant since returning to the \nPage 37 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 38 of 50\nUnited States, knowledge of his TSDB status in the community deterred customers \nto Fikre’s restaurant.  Community members told Fikre that “your place is hot” and \nthat the “FBI is watching.”   \n140.  Upon information and belief, a friend working in the aerospace industry \nbroke off communication with Fikre due to his TSDB status. \n141.  In 2016, Fikre traveled with his wife and 11 month old child by plane to \nSan Diego.  As they obtained their boarding passes from a ticketing agent, Fikre \nheard the ticketing agent tell Defendants’ agent over the phone that Fikre was \ntraveling with two others.   \n142.  Prior to the trip, Fikre tried to explain to his wife why it may be better \nfor them to fly separately.  Fikre feared that Defendants would treat his wife and \ntheir infant child like they treated him, and Fikre sought to spare his family the \nordeal.  Fikre also wanted to spare himself the humiliation of having his family see \nFikre go through the onerous and disparate processes Defendants impose on him.  \nBut Fikre and his wife were newly married with a young infant, and his suggestion \nto travel separately from his wife was disconcerting to her and the family traveled \ntogether. \n143.  When Fikre’s family was screened by Defendant TSA together, Fikre’s \nwife and 11 month old child were searched invasively as if they were suspected \nterrorists, just as Fikre had been on his way to Saudi Arabia for hajj.  In addition to \naggressive patdowns and body searches of Fikre’s wife, Defendant TSA patted down \nthe 11 month old baby, touching every part of the infant’s body in a manner that \nalarmed Fikre and his wife.  Their child was distressed and crying during this search, \nPage 38 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 39 of 50\nand Fikre felt horrified that his TSDB status was causing this to happen to his wife \nand their young baby.   \n144.  After Fikre and his family completed this screening, they proceeded to \nthe gate.  Fikre understood that if they boarded the plane together Defendants would \ncause the entire family to be screened again at the gate, which would replicate the \nhumiliation they felt when they proceeded through the security line.  For this reason, \nFikre sat separately from his family and ignored his infant child who sought Fikre’s \nattention in an effort to spare the child and his wife the humiliation of being screened \nat the gate in front of other passengers.  It worked, and Fikre alone was invasively \npatted down and searched at the gate.   \n145.  As a result of this harrowing experience, Fikre has not flown with his \nfamily and, so long as the same constitutionally defective procedures remain, Fikre \nwill continue to be deterred from flying with his family.   \n146.  Many of Fikre’s closest cousins, as a result of Defendants’ decision to \nimpose on him a TSDB status, will not talk with him anymore and have ended their \nrelationships with Fikre. The cousins fear that associating with Fikre may get them \nin trouble with the federal government.  \n147.  His relationship with his older brother, who has been questioned about \nFikre in accordance with Fikre’s TSDB status, has been damaged by the TSDB status \nDefendants assigned Fikre. \n148.  On June 16, 2019, the Government asserted that Fikre “will not be \nplaced on the No Fly List in the future based on the currently available information.” \nPage 39 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 40 of 50\nDkt. 130-2 at ¶ 5. But the Government has not explained what “currently available \ninformation” means. It is not clear whether that involves non-arbitrary information, \nor Fikre participating in innocent or even constitutionally-protected conduct. See \nElhady v. Kable, 391 F. Supp. 3d 562, 581 (E.D. Va. 2019) (Government claims an \nauthority to place individuals on watchlist for innocent and constitutionally-protected \nreasons). The Government has also made no an assertion to the Court that is binding \nin any way. See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982) \n(voluntary cessation does not render a case moot when government is “free to return \nto his old ways”). In other words, despite the declaration, the procedural defects \nresponsible for Fikre’s constitutional injury persist. \n149.  The government has not assured Fikre that he will not be banned from \nflying for the same reasons that prompted the government to add him to the list in \nthe  first  place,  nor  has  it  addressed  the  procedural  defects  that  caused  Fikre’s \nconstitutional violation in the first place. \n150.  Both (1) because the Government has not acknowledged that Fikre was \nillegally placed on the No Fly List and the TSDB, and (2) because the Government \nhas not acknowledged that Fikre will not be returned to the No Fly List absent a new, \nindependent reason as determined by constitutionally adequate procedures, Fikre \nremains stigmatized as a known or suspected terrorist and as an individual who \nrepresents a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and who is \noperationally capable of doing so. \n151.  Until  the  Government  both  (1)  acknowledges  that  its  investigation \nrevealed  Fikre  was  illegaly  placed  on  the  No  Fly  List  and  the  TSDB,  and  (2) \nPage 40 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 41 of 50\nacknowledges that Fikre will not be returned to the No Fly List via the same defective \nprocedures  that  led  to  his  illegal  placement,  Fikre’s  acquaintances,  business \nassociates, and evn family members will continue to persist in shunning or avoiding \nhim despite his renewed ability to travel.  \n152.  The Government’s vague litigation declaration on June 16, 2019 that \nFikre “will not be placed on the No Fly List in the future based on the currently \navailable information” does not provide the necessary vindication to eliminate the \nstigmatizing effects of No Fly List and watchlist placement. Indeed, the declaration \nis expressly non-vindicating, asserting that Fikre ‘was placed on the No Fly List in \naccordance with applicable policies and procedures” and that he was “removed form \nthe No Fly List upon the determination that he no longer satisfied the criteria for \nplacement on the No Fly List.” Dkt. 130-2 at ¶ 5 (emphasis added). In other words—\nin a public document available on PACER—the Government continues to expressly \nand publicly assert that Fikre at one time properly belonged on the No Fly List, and \nthus at one time represented a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of \nterrorism and was operationally capable of doing so.  \n153.  There has been no renouncement by the government of its prerogative \nand authority to place Fikre on the No Fly List. \nClaim One \nFifth Amendment Procedural Due Process -  \nPlacement and Retention on the No Fly List and TSDB \n (Against All Defendants) \n154.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n155.  Defendants placed Plaintiff’s name in the Terrorist Screening Database \nPage 41 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 42 of 50\nand on its No Fly List subcomponent. \n156.  Plaintiff learned that he was placed on the federal terrorist watchlist \nand No Fly List subsequent to being added to the TSDB and No Fly List. \n157.  Plaintiff has experienced economic, reputational, physical, and liberty \nharms due to Defendants’ placement of his name on the TSDB and No Fly List.   \n158.  Plaintiff’s harms attributable to placement of his name on the TSDB and \nNo Fly List include coercion to violate his religious beliefs, foreign detention and \ntorture, inability to travel by air or home to the United States, monitoring of his \nelectronic communications, loss of financial resources, loss of business opportunities, \nand divorce from his now ex-wife. \n159.  Defendants have disseminated Plaintiff’s status in the TSDB and his No \nFly List annotation to federal agencies, state agencies, foreign governments, and \nprivate entities including airlines. \n160.  Plaintiff has a protected liberty interest in domestic and international \ntravel.   \n161.  Plaintiff also has a protected liberty interest in his reputation and in \nfreedom  from  government-assigned  stigmas  that  restrict  or  prevent  him  from \nengaging in activities in which he can lawfully engage and in which others not \nstigmatized are free to engage. \n162.  Plaintiff also has a protected liberty interest in being able to practice his \nsincerely-held  religious  beliefs,  free  of  Government  interference  and  without \nretribution from the Government. \n163.  Defendants have imposed on Plaintiff the stigmatizing label of “known \nor  suspected  terrorist.”    Plaintiff  has  a  right  to  be  free  from  false  government \nPage 42 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 43 of 50\nstigmatization as an individual who is a “known or suspected” terrorist, or who is \notherwise associated with terrorist activity.    \n164.  Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiff with meaningful notice of his \nTSDB or No Fly List status, the factual basis for that status, and an opportunity to \ncontest it. \n165.  Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiff with an explanation for his \nTSDB or No Fly List status, any changes to that status, or the factual basis for those \nchanges. \n166.  Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiff with a guarantee that he is \nno longer on the TSDB, or that he will not be re-added via the same constitutionally \ndefective procedures to either the TSDB or the No Fly List absent new “derogatory” \ninformation about. \n167.  Defendants have failed to remove or expunge the factual basis for or \nhistory changes to Plaintiff’s TSDB or No Fly List status from Defendants’ records. \n168.  Defendants  have  failed  to  repudiate  the  original  basis of Plaintiff’s \nTSDB or No Fly List status. \n169.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  and  keeping  Plaintiff  on  the  FBI-\nmaintained, secret TSDB and No Fly List substantially interfered with and deprived \nPlaintiff of his liberty interest in international travel.  Defendants’ actions in placing \nand keeping Plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, secret TSDB and No Fly List also \ninjured Plaintiff’s liberty interest in his reputation by, first, stigmatizing him as a \nknown  or  suspected  terrorist  and  as  an  individual  who  represents  a  threat  of \nengaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and who is operationally capable \nof doing so and, second, on the basis of that stigma, depriving him of the ability to \nPage 43 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 44 of 50\ntravel by air domestically and internationally as others are permitted to do and as \nPlaintiff would be permitted to do absent the stigma.  \n170.  Defendants’  actions  in  placing  and  keeping  Plaintiff  on  the  FBI-\nmaintained, secret No Fly List without informing him of such placement, of the basis \nfor his inclusion on the No Fly List, of the means of removing his name from the No \nFly List, and without providing an independent forum in which Plaintiff might secure \nthe removal of his name from the No Fly List, all violated and are continuing to \nviolate Plaintiff’s right to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment.  Such \nprocedures as do exist for challenging inclusion on the No Fly List are inadequate to \nsatisfy the notice and hearing requirements of procedural due process. \n171.  By failing to expunge their records, inform Plaintiff as to whether he \nremains on the TSDB in any form, or correct the public record regarding Plaintiffs’ \nyears-long  designation  as  a  known  or  suspected  terrorist  on  the  No  Fly  List, \nDefendants have imposed and continue to impose harm. \n172.  By  these  actions,  Defendants  are  irreparably  harming  plaintiff.  \nPlaintiff has no adequate remedy at law for Defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, \nand Defendants will continue to violate Plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and \nrestrained by this Court. \n \nClaim Two \nFifth Amendment Substantive Due Process \n (Against All Defendants)  \n173.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n174.  Substantive due process protects Americans’ freedom from government \naction which infringes upon their fundamental constitutional rights.  Government \naction which infringes upon these rights cannot be arbitrary and must be narrowly \nPage 44 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 45 of 50\ntailored to serve a compelling government interest. \n175.  Defendants have placed Plaintiff on the TSDB and No Fly List despite \nlacking any reasonable suspicion that Plaintiff is a known, suspected, or potential \nterrorist. \n176.  Defendants  consider  and  rely  on  race,  ethnicity,  national  origin, \nreligious affiliation, and First Amendment protected activities as factors supporting \nplacement on the TSDB and No Fly List.  Defendants considered and relied upon one \nor more of these impermissible factors in placing Plaintiff on the TSDB and No Fly \nList. \n177.  Defendants  lack  a  compelling  interest  in  placing  innocent  persons, \nparticularly those with no prior terrorism related criminal record and no probable \ncause for suspicion of terrorism related crimes, on the federal terrorist watchlist. \n178.  Defendants lack a compelling interest in the TSDB and No Fly List \nannotation insofar as their true purpose is to provide law enforcement with a tool to \nharass  and  intimidate  American  Muslims,  to  track  such  persons,  and  coerce \nAmerican Muslims into becoming informants. \n179.  Defendants’ placement of Plaintiff on the watchlist has placed an undue \nburden on his fundamental rights to domestic and international travel, including his \nright as a U.S. citizen to return to the United States. \n180.  Defendants’ placement of Plaintiff on the watchlist has placed an undue \nburden on his fundamental right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  \n181.  Defendants’ placement of Plaintiff on the watchlist has placed an undue \nburden on his fundamental right to be free from government coercion of his religious \npractices.  \nPage 45 – SEVENTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-MO    Document 145    Filed 12/18/19    Page 46 of 50\n182.  Defendants’ actions in placing Plaintiff on the TSDB and No Fly List, in \nimposing  the  stigmatizing  label  of  “known  or  suspected  terrorists,”  and  widely \ndisseminating the stigmatizing label to numerous governmental, foreign, and private \npartners, are arbitrary and capricious, shock the conscience, violate the decencies of \ncivilized conduct and are so brutal and offensive that they do not comport with the \ntraditional ideas of fair play and decency. \n183.  Defendants’ watchlists are also not narrowly tailored insofar as the \nfederal terrorist watchlists are entirely and demonstrably ineffectual and obvious \nalternatives exist. The Defendants, for example, have never placed a person who \ncommitted a violent act of terrorism inside the United States on the No Fly List prior \nto the terrorist act. \n184.  By placing Plaintiff on the federal watchlist, Defendants have caused \nhim  actual,  imminent  and  irreparable  injury  that  cannot  be  undone  through \nmonetary remedies. \n185.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law for  defendants’ continuing \nunlawful conduct, and Defendants will continue to violate Plaintiff’s legal rights \nunless enjoined and restrained by this Court. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:    \n1.

The panel held that the record\nsuggested that plaintiff’s removal from the No Fly List was\nmore likely an exercise of discretion than a decision arising\nfrom a broad change in agency policy or procedure.  The\npanel  further  held  that  the  government  had  not  assured\nplaintiff that he would not be banned from flying for the same\nreasons that prompted the government to add him to the list\nin the first place, nor had it verified the implementation of\nprocedural  safeguards  conditioning  its  ability  to  revise\nplaintiff’s status on the receipt of new information.  Finally,\nthe panel held that plaintiff’s removal from the No Fly List\ndid  not  completely  eradicate  the  effects  of  the  alleged\nviolation. \nThe panel remanded for further proceedings.

FBI\nOPINION\nCHRISTEN, Circuit Judge:\nYonas Fikre sued the United States government, alleging\nthat  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigations  violated  his\nsubstantive and procedural due process rights by placing and\nmaintaining him on the No Fly List.  While the suit was\npending, the Defendants removed Fikre from the list and the\ndistrict court dismissed Fikre’s due process claims as moot. \nFikre appeals.  We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and\nwe reverse.\nBACKGROUND1\nFikre is an American citizen who, until 2009, lived in\nPortland,  Oregon  and    worked  for  a  cellular  telephone\ncompany.  In late 2009, Fikre traveled to Sudan to establish\na consumer electronics business in East Africa.  In April\n2010, while still in Sudan, Fikre was approached by two FBI\nagents who questioned him about his association with the as-\nSaber Mosque in Portland and his commercial finances.  The\nagents told Fikre that he had been placed on the No Fly List,\nwhich identifies individuals who are prohibited from flying\ninto, out of, or over the United States and Canadian airspace\nby commercial airlines.  The FBI agents offered to remove\nFikre from the list if he became a government informant. \nFikre refused.\n1 At this stage of the proceedings, “[w]e accept as true all well-\npleaded allegations of material fact, and construe them in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party.”  Daniels-Hall v. Nat’l Educ. Ass’n,\n629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 5 of 16\nFIKRE V. FBI 5\nFikre’s business took him to the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE) in September 2010.  As recounted by Fikre, Emirati\nsecret police seized him from the place where he was staying\nin June 2011 and transported him to an unknown location\nwhere he was imprisoned and tortured for 106 days.  During\nthis time, Fikre was interrogated about his connection to the\nas-Saber Mosque and the nature of his financial dealings. \nOne of the interrogators told Fikre that the FBI had requested\nhis detention.  Fikre was released in September 2011, but he\nwas unable to board a plane bound for the United States\nbecause he remained on the No Fly List.  Fikre sought refuge\nin Sweden.  While there, he consulted an attorney and held a\npress conference denouncing his capture and confinement in\nthe UAE.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s Traveler\nRedress  Inquiry  Program  (TRIP)  allows  individuals  the\nopportunity  to  have  the  Transportation  Security\nAdministration review and, if appropriate, correct their files\nif it determines that a person has been erroneously placed on\na  watchlist.    As  initially  implemented  in  2007,  the\ngovernment responded to TRIP inquiries without confirming\na traveler’s inclusion on the No Fly List.  Fikre attempted in\nNovember 2013 to rectify his situation through TRIP, but the\nDHS neither confirmed nor denied his placement on the No\nFly List in response to this first inquiry; it stated only that “no\nchanges or corrections [we]re warranted at th[at] time.”\nIn 2015, the DHS modified TRIP to comply with the\njudgment in Latif v. Holder, 28 F. Supp. 3d 1134 (D. Or.\n2014).    The  revised  TRIP  protocol  includes  additional\nprocedural safeguards that were unavailable at the time Fikre\nfiled  his  action.    Requesters  are  now  apprised  of  their\npresence or absence on the No Fly List and the unclassified\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 6 of 16\n6 FIKRE V. FBI\nreasons for their status.  Applying the revised procedures, in\nFebruary 2015 the DHS informed Fikre that he was and\nwould remain on the  No Fly List  because he had been\n“identified as an individual who may be a threat to civil\naviation  or  national  security.”    No  other  reasons  were\nprovided for the decision to maintain Fikre on the No Fly\nList.  Fikre was ultimately denied asylum in Sweden, and the\nSwedish government returned him to the United States in\n2015.  Fikre avers that these events damaged his reputation\nby stigmatizing him as a suspected terrorist and so strained\nhis marriage that his wife divorced him while he was stranded\noutside of the country.\nFikre brought the instant suit against the government\nraising a variety of common law, statutory, and constitutional\nclaims.2  As relevant here, Fikre alleged that the FBI violated\nhis right to substantive due process by depriving him of his\nliberty interest in his reputation and international travel,3 and\nby conditioning his removal from the No Fly List upon his\nagreement  to  become  a  government  informant.    Fikre’s\ncomplaint also maintained that the FBI denied him procedural\ndue process by placing and keeping him on the No Fly List\nwithout adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. \nFikre prayed for injunctive and declaratory relief for both due\nprocess  claims  and  asked,  among  other  things,  for  a\n2 Fikre’s complaint listed sixteen causes of action, but only his\nsubstantive due process, procedural due process, and Fourth Amendment\nclaims are implicated in this appeal.  We affirm the dismissal of Fikre’s\nFourth  Amendment  claims  in  a  concurrently  filed  memorandum\ndisposition.\n3 The Supreme Court has recognized the right to international travel\nas a protected right under substantive due process.  Kent v. Dulles, 357\nU.S. 116, 125 (1958).\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 7 of 16\nFIKRE V. FBI 7\ndeclaration by the government that he should not have been\nadded to the No Fly List.\nThe Defendants moved to dismiss the operative complaint\nand,  shortly  thereafter,  notified  Fikre  that  he  had  been\nremoved from the No Fly List.  In a joint status report filed at\nthe district court’s direction, Fikre agreed that, to the extent\nhe sought an injunction requiring the Defendants to remove\nhim from the list, that claim was moot.  Fikre contended,\nhowever, that he remained entitled to other injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief.\nThe  district  court  subsequently  dismissed  Fikre’s\nremaining procedural and substantive due process claims in\na detailed decision.  The court reasoned that the government’s\nremoval of Fikre from the No Fly List was “a sufficiently\ndefinite action” to render his claims moot.  In reaching this\nconclusion, the district court observed that the Defendants\nhad publicly stated that Fikre was no longer on the No Fly\nList, that more than six months had elapsed since this change\nin status, and that the record did not indicate a lack of good\nfaith  on  the  government’s  part.    The  district  court  also\n“emphasize[d]” that “the courthouse doors will be open to\n[Fikre]” were he to be reinstated to the No Fly List in the\nfuture.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nWe  review  “questions  of  Article  III  justiciability,\nincluding mootness” de novo.  Bell v. City of Boise, 709 F.3d\n890, 896 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Sierra Forest Legacy v.\nSherman, 646 F.3d 1161, 1176 (9th Cir. 2011)).\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 8 of 16\n8 FIKRE V. FBI\nDISCUSSION\nThe  government  argues  that  Fikre’s  procedural  and\nsubstantive due process claims are moot because he has been\nremoved from the No Fly List.  In the government’s view,\ninsofar as Fikre sought to be removed from the No Fly List,\nthat outcome has now been achieved and his former status\ndoes  not  impinge  on  his  existing  legal  rights.    The\ngovernment argues that there is no longer a live controversy\nand no effectual relief the court could grant.\nFikre begs to differ.  According to him, the voluntary\ncessation doctrine should apply to preclude a finding of\nmootness,  especially  because  the  government  has  not\nexplained why it added him to the No Fly List in the first\nplace and why, years later, it spontaneously took him off of\nit.  Fikre urges that nothing prevents the government from\nputting him back on the list and that his claims are therefore\nnot moot.\n“Article III of the Constitution grants the Judicial Branch\nauthority  to  adjudicate  ‘Cases’  and  ‘Controversies.’” \nAlready, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 90 (2013).  “A case\nbecomes  moot—and  therefore  no  longer  a  ‘Case’  or\n‘Controversy’ for purposes of Article III—‘when the issues\npresented are no longer “live” or the parties lack a legally\ncognizable interest in the outcome.’”  Id. at 91 (quoting\nMurphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1982) (per curiam)).  It\nis well-established, however, that “voluntary cessation of\nallegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of\npower to hear and determine the case” unless “it can be said\nwith assurance that ‘there is no reasonable expectation . . .’\nthat the alleged violation will recur” and “interim relief or\nevents have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 9 of 16\nFIKRE V. FBI 9\nof the alleged violation.”  County of Los Angeles v. Davis,\n440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (alteration in original) (quoting\nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632–33\n(1953)); see Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v.\nComer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2019 n.1 (2017).  A party asserting\nmootness has “the ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court\nthat the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to\nstart  up  again.”    Adarand  Constructors,  Inc.  v.  Slater,\n528 U.S. 216, 222 (2000) (alteration in original) (quoting\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services\n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000)).  Where that party is\nthe government we presume that it acts in good faith, Am.\nCargo Transp., Inc. v. United States, 625 F.3d 1176, 1180\n(9th Cir. 2010), though the government must still demonstrate\nthat  the  change  in  its  behavior  is  “entrenched”  or\n“permanent.”  McCormack v. Herzog, 788 F.3d 1017, 1025\n(9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bell, 709 F.3d at 900); see Rosebrock\nv. Mathis, 745 F.3d 963, 971 (9th Cir. 2014).\nOur precedents illuminate the contours of such an inquiry. \nFirst, the form the governmental action takes is critical and,\nsometimes, dispositive.  “A statutory change . . . is usually\nenough  to  render  a  case  moot,  even  if  the  legislature\npossesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is\ndismissed.”  Native Vill. of Noatak v. Blatchford, 38 F.3d\n1505, 1510 (9th Cir. 1994); see Chem. Producers & Distribs.\nAss’n v. Helliker, 463 F.3d 871, 877–78 (9th Cir. 2006).  The\nrigors of the legislative process “bespeak . . . finality and not\n. . . for-the-moment, opportunistic tentativeness.”  Libertarian\nParty of Ark. v. Martin, 876 F.3d 948, 951 (8th Cir. 2017). \nOn the other hand, “an executive action that is not governed\nby any clear or codified procedures cannot moot a claim.” \nMcCormack, 788 F.3d at 1025; see Trinity Lutheran Church,\n137 S. Ct. at 2019 n.1 (holding that although the state had\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 10 of 16\n10 FIKRE V. FBI\n“beg[u]n allowing religious organizations to compete for and\nreceive [government] grants on the same terms as secular\norganizations,” it did not meet the requisite “‘heavy burden’\nof making ‘absolutely clear’ that it could not revert to its\npolicy of excluding religious organizations” (quoting Friends\nof the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 189)).  For cases that lie\nbetween these extremes, we ask whether the government’s\nnew position “could be easily abandoned or altered in the\nfuture.”  Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 972 (quoting Bell, 709 F.3d\nat 901).\nWe  have  also  examined  the  avowed  rationale  for\ngovernmental action when assessing the merits of a claim of\nvoluntary cessation.  For instance, Olagues v. Russoniello,\n770 F.2d 791 (9th Cir. 1985), held that abandonment of a\nfederal investigation into illegal voter registration by non-\ncitizens  did  not  moot  the  plaintiffs’  suit.    Id.  at  794. \nImportant to our conclusion was the fact that “the United\nStates Attorney did not voluntarily cease the challenged\nactivity because he felt that the investigation was improper.” \nId. at 795.  “Rather, [he] terminated the investigation solely\nbecause it failed to produce evidence supporting any further\ninvestigative activities” and “ha[d] at all times continued to\nargue vigorously that his actions were lawful.”  Id.; see also\nNorman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Lab., 135 F.3d\n1260, 1274 (9th Cir. 1998) (the discontinuance of syphilis\ntests  on  employees  “merely  for  reasons  of  ‘cost-\neffectiveness’” did not moot the case because the laboratory\ndid not “offer[] any reason why they might not return in the\nfuture to their original views on the utility of mandatory\ntesting” and therefore did not rule out that testing might be\nemployed again); Porter v. Bowen, 496 F.3d 1009, 1016–17\n(9th Cir. 2007) (letter from California Secretary of State to\nthe California legislature tolerating the operation of vote-\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 11 of 16\nFIKRE V. FBI 11\nswapping websites pending clarification of state election code\ndid not moot lawsuit because “the Secretary has maintained\nthroughout the nearly seven years of litigation . . . that [her\npredecessor] had the authority under state law to threaten\n[plaintiffs] with prosecution”); Forest Guardians v. Johanns,\n450 F.3d 455, 460, 462 (9th Cir. 2006) (Forest Service’s\npractice  of  not  monitoring  utilization  levels  of  grazed\nallotment likely to persist despite interim monitoring because\nthe agency “argued throughout th[e] litigation that it is not\nrequired to meet [those monitoring requirements]”).\nIn contrast, White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242–44 (9th\nCir. 2000) held that a change in administrative policy that\nembraced plaintiffs’ free speech arguments rendered their\nclaims moot.  The plaintiffs in White opposed the conversion\nof a motel into a multi-family housing unit for the homeless,\nid. at 1220, by “wr[iting] to the Berkeley City Council,\nsp[eaking] out before the Zoning Adjustment Board and at\nother public meetings, and publish[ing] a newsletter with\narticles critical of the project.”  Id. at 1221.  They aired their\ngrievances to the press, asked the business community to\nespouse  their  cause,  and  challenged  the  integrity  of  the\nZoning Adjustment Board’s decision-making processes.  Id. \nAfter the Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(HUD)  investigated  the  plaintiffs  for  engaging  in  a\ndiscriminatory housing practice under the Fair Housing Act\n(FHA), the plaintiffs sued the agency for injunctive and\ndeclaratory  relief.    Id.  at  1222–25.    The  investigation\nprompted HUD to promulgate guidelines prohibiting the\ninvestigation of petitioning or lobbying activities that did not\nthreaten physical harm.    Id. at 1242–43.  We held that\nplaintiff’s claim was moot in light of HUD’s new guidelines. \nId. at 1243–44.  HUD’s change of heart did not fall within\nthe voluntary cessation exception to mootness because it\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 12 of 16\n12 FIKRE V. FBI\n“represent[ed]  a  permanent  change  in  the  way  HUD\nconduct[ed] FHA investigations,” was “broad in scope and\nunequivocal in tone,” and, significantly, “fully supportive of\nFirst Amendment Rights.”  Id.\nOur case law teaches that a voluntary change in official\nstance or behavior moots an action only when it is “absolutely\nclear” to the court, considering the “procedural safeguards”\ninsulating the new state of affairs from arbitrary reversal  and\nthe government’s rationale for its changed practice(s), that the\nactivity  complained  of  will  not  reoccur.    McCormack,\n788 F.3d at 1025; Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 974.  No bright-line\nrule separates cases comprehended by the voluntary cessation\ndoctrine  from  those  that  are  not,  but  the  government’s\nunambiguous renunciation of its past actions can compensate\nfor the ease with which it may relapse into them.  In White,\nfor  instance,  we  deemed  a  memorandum  issued  by  an\nassistant secretary for the Office of Fair Housing and Equal\nOpportunity sufficient to moot a case, even though there had\nbeen no intervening statutory or regulatory change, because\nthe  memorandum  “addresse[d]  all  of  the  objectionable\nmeasures that HUD officials took against the plaintiffs . . .\nand even confesse[d] that th[e] case was the catalyst for the\nagency’s adoption of the new policy.”  227 F.3d at 1243. \nThough there is no bright-line rule for application of the\nvoluntary cessation doctrine, this much is apparent: a claim\nis not moot if the government remains practically and legally\n“free to return to [its] old ways” despite abandoning them in\nthe ongoing litigation.  United States v. W.T. Grant Co.,\n345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953).\nReturning to Fikre’s appeal, the government insists that\nit is “absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could\nnot reasonably be expected to recur,” Already, 568 U.S. at 91\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 13 of 16\nFIKRE V. FBI 13\n(quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 190), because\nit filed a notice in district court announcing Fikre’s removal\nfrom the No Fly List.  We disagree.  Even accepting the\ngovernment’s argument that its notice constitutes a “formal\nagency action, publicly made, and unequivocally expressed,”\nthe mere announcement that Fikre was removed from the list\nfalls short of meeting the government’s burden.4\nTo begin, the FBI’s decision to restore Fikre’s flying\nprivileges is an individualized determination untethered to\nany explanation or change in policy, much less an abiding\nchange in policy.  Cf. Am. Cargo Transp., 625 F.3d at 1180. \nThe DHS re-evaluated Fikre’s presence on the No Fly List\nin  2013  and  2015  pursuant  to  its  TRIP  procedure  and\ndetermined that no adjustments to his status were necessary. \nIndeed, the DHS affirmed as late as March 2015—after it had\namended TRIP to conform to the decision in Latif—that Fikre\nposed “a threat to civil aviation or national security” and it\nrefused to remove him from the No Fly List.  Yet it did just\nthat  fourteen  months  later,  without  explanation  or  any\nannounced change in policy.  Fikre was taken off the list two\nmonths after briefing was completed on the government’s\nmotion to dismiss Fikre’s lawsuit.  See Reply to Motion to\nDismiss, Fikre v. FBI, No. 3:13-cv-00899-BR (D. Or. Oct.\n24, 2016), Dkt. # 96.  This record suggests that Fikre’s\nremoval from the No Fly List was more likely an exercise of\n4 We note that the focus should not be on the absence of evidence that\nthe government intends to reinstate Fikre to the list, as that would\nimproperly shift the evidentiary burden to Fikre to prove the alleged\nviolation will not reoccur.  See Nat. Res. Def. Council v. County of Los\nAngeles, 840 F.3d 1098, 1104 (9th Cir. 2016).  The government bears the\nburden of proving mootness.  Id.\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 14 of 16\n14 FIKRE V. FBI\ndiscretion than a decision arising from a broad change in\nagency policy or procedure.\nMoreover, the government has not assured Fikre that he\nwill not be banned from flying for the same reasons that\nprompted the government to add him to the list in the first\nplace, nor has it verified the implementation of procedural\nsafeguards conditioning its ability to revise Fikre’s status on\nthe receipt of new information.  As far as we can tell, the\ncurrent  permission  Fikre  has  to  travel  by  air  is\n“discretionary,”  and  not  “entrenched”  or  “permanent.” \nMcCormack, 788 F.3d at 1025.  We presume the government\nacts in good faith and do not impute to it a strategic motive to\nmoot Fikre’s suit, see Am. Cargo Transp., 625 F.3d at 1180,\nbut with no explanation of the reasons for dropping Fikre\nfrom the No Fly List, we may not infer the government’s\nacquiescence to the righteousness of Fikre’s contentions.  On\nthis record, the government has not repudiated the decision to\nadd Fikre to the No Fly List and maintain him there for\napproximately five years.\nFinally, in response to the government’s assertion that no\nrelief is available for Fikre’s claims, we note that Fikre’s\nremoval from the No Fly List does not “completely and\nirrevocably eradicate[] the effects of the alleged violation[s].”\nDavis, 440 U.S. at 631.  The notice filed by the government\naverred  only  that  “counsel  recently  was  advised  by  the\nTerrorist Screening Center that [Fikre] has been removed\nfrom the No Fly List.”  Absent an acknowledgment by the\ngovernment  that  its  investigation  revealed Fikre  did  not\nbelong on the list, and that he will not be returned to the list\nbased on the currently available evidence, Fikre remains, in\nhis own words, “stigmatiz[ed] . . . as a known or suspected\nterrorist and as an individual who represents a threat of\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 15 of 16\nFIKRE V. FBI 15\nengaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and who\nis operationally capable of doing so.”  Because acquaintances,\nbusiness associates, and perhaps even family members are\nlikely to persist in shunning or avoiding him despite his\nrenewed ability to travel, it is plain that vindication in this\naction would have actual and palpable consequences for\nFikre.\nThe government suggests in its appellate brief that if\nFikre is ever put back on the No Fly List, that determination\nwould “necessarily be . . . predicated on a new and different\nfactual record,”  but the government has not executed a\ndeclaration to that effect.  Cf. Mokdad v. Sessions, 876 F.3d\n167, 169 (6th Cir. 2017).  Nor has the government explained\nwhy such a declaration would not constitute additional relief\nthat may be afforded to Fikre.  When examining whether a\nclaim has become moot, “[t]he question is not whether the\nprecise relief sought at the time [the case] was filed is still\navailable.  The question is whether there can be any effective\nrelief.”  McCormack, 788 F.3d at 1024 (second alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Earth Island Inst. v. U.S. Forest Serv.,\n442 F.3d 1147, 1157 (9th Cir. 2006)).\nBecause there are neither procedural hurdles to reinstating\nFikre on the No Fly List based solely on facts already known,\nnor any renouncement by the government of its prerogative\nand  authority  to  do  so,  the  voluntary  cessation  doctrine\napplies.  Fikre’s due process claims are not moot.\n\n  Case: 16-36072, 09/20/2018, ID: 11018392, DktEntry: 47-1, Page 16 of 16\n16 FIKRE V.

The Court also\nDENIES as moot Official Capacity Defendants’ Unopposed Motion\n(#91) to Stay Plaintiff’s Due Process Claims.\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff filed his Fifth Amended Complaint (#87) (FAC) on\nNovember 29, 2015.  \nOn January 21, 2016, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) Official Capacity Defendants\nmoved to dismiss the claims that Plaintiff Yonas Fikre brings\nagainst them in his FAC as described below and also moved in the \n3 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nalternative to stay Plaintiff’s due-process claims.1\nOn February 11, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Response (#95) in\nOpposition to Official Capacity Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \nOn March 3, 2016, Official Capacity Defendants filed a Reply\n(#96) in Support of Motion to Dismiss.\nOn May 9, 2016, Official Capacity Defendants filed a Notice\n(#98) Regarding Plaintiff’s Status in which they represented\n“Plaintiff has been removed from the No Fly List.”  That same day\nby Order (#99) the Court directed the parties2 to confer and to\nfile no later than May 16, 2016, a single, joint status report in\nwhich the parties set out their positions regarding the effect of\nPlaintiff’s removal from the No-Fly List on Official Capacity\nDefendants’ pending Motion (#90) to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Fifth\nAmended Complaint and Official Capacity Defendants’ Unopposed\nMotion (#91) to Stay Due Process Claims and, in particular, to\nspecify the portions of the pending Motions that are rendered\nmoot and the portions that are unaffected by the Notice.\n1 David Noordeloos and the John and Jane Doe Defendants, who\nPlaintiff sued in their individual capacities (collectively\nIndividual Capacity Defendants), have not yet been served and,\ntherefore, are not currently parties to this litigation.  Thus,\nClaims Two, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, and Eleven, are\nnot at issue in this Motion because those claims relate\nexclusively to Individual Capacity Defendants.\n2 For purposes of this Motion only, the Court’s references\nto the “parties” include only Plaintiff and Official Capacity\nDefendants.\n4 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nIn a Joint Status Report (#100) filed May 16, 2016, the\nparties agreed Claims One and Three should be dismissed to the\nextent that those claims seek injunctive relief related to the\nremoval of Plaintiff’s name from the No-Fly List.  Plaintiff,\nhowever, contends he remains entitled to other injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief on Claims One and Three.\nOn May 20, 2016, the Court issued Order (#101) in which it\nconcluded oral argument was unnecessary to resolve the pending\nMotions.  In light of the intervening developments since the\nfiling of Defendants’ Motions, however, the Court directed the\nparties to file a stipulation confirming their agreement as to\nthe extent to which Defendants’ Notice (#98) moots or otherwise\nresolves any of Plaintiff’s pending claims.  In addition, the\nCourt provided the parties an opportunity to file simultaneous,\nsupplemental memoranda regarding the effect that Plaintiff’s\nremoval from the No-Fly List has on Official Capacity Defendants’\nMotions and to provide any additional argument.  The parties\nfiled their respective supplemental memoranda (#103, #104) on\nJune 23, 2016, and the Court took this matter under advisement\nwithout argument on that date.\n \n5 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nBACKGROUND\nFor purposes of these Motions, the Court deems as true the\nfollowing background facts from Plaintiff’s FAC, Official\nCapacity Defendants’ Notice (#98) Regarding Plaintiff’s Status,\nand the parties’ Joint Status Report (#100):\nI. The No-Fly List\nThe FBI is responsible for development and maintenance of\nthe No-Fly List, which identifies individuals who are “prohibited\nfrom flying into, out of, or over the United States” or into, out\nof, or over Canadian airspace by commercial airlines.\nII. Interrogation of Plaintiff and Placement on the No-Fly List\nPlaintiff is a 33-year-old naturalized American citizen of\nEritrean descent who was a resident of Portland, Oregon,\nbeginning in 2006.  In late 2009 Plaintiff decided to use his\nexperience working for a cellular telephone company in the United\nStates to pursue the business of distributing and selling\nconsumer electronic products in East Africa, and, accordingly,\nPlaintiff traveled to Sudan where some of his extended family\nlives.  In Sudan Plaintiff informed the United States Embassy in\nKhartoum of his presence in the country and his intention to\npursue business opportunities there.  Based on encouragement from\nEmbassy personnel, Plaintiff began the process of obtaining a\nSudanese business license.\n6 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nOn April 21, 2010, Plaintiff received a telephone call from\nthe Embassy requesting Plaintiff to contact Defendant Noordeloos. \nWhen Plaintiff returned the call, Noordeloos represented himself\nas an Embassy official working for the State Department. \nNoordeloos invited Plaintiff to a luncheon at the Embassy the\nfollowing day to discuss safety during a period of political\nturmoil in Sudan.\nThe next morning Plaintiff arrived at the Embassy and was\nmet by Noordeloos and Defendant John Doe I, who introduced\nhimself as Jason Dundas.  Noordeloos and Dundas escorted\nPlaintiff to a small meeting room, shut the door, positioned\nthemselves between Plaintiff and the door, and informed Plaintiff\nthat they worked for the FBI Field Office in Portland, Oregon.\nWhen he was told Noordeloos and Dundas were FBI agents from\nPortland, Plaintiff requested to be represented by his legal\ncounsel during any interrogation.  Noordeloos, however, informed\nPlaintiff that he could not return to the United States to confer\nwith his Oregon-based legal counsel because Plaintiff had been\nplaced on the No-Fly List.  \nThe ensuing interrogation lasted several hours until the end\nof the business day.  Throughout the course of the interrogation\nNoordeloos and Dundas questioned Plaintiff about the As-Saber\nMosque in Portland where Plaintiff had attended prayer services. \nIn addition, Noordeloos and Dundas questioned Plaintiff about the\n7 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nsource of financial support for his business endeavors and told\nhim that sanctions made his business activities in Sudan illegal. \nFinally, Noordeloos asked Plaintiff to be an informant for the\nFBI in exchange for “substantial compensation” and removal from\nthe No-Fly List.  Plaintiff responded he did not wish to become\nan informant.  At the end of the business day Noordeloos\nsuggested they resume the discussion the following day. \nPlaintiff agreed.\nThe following morning Plaintiff called Noordeloos on the\ntelephone and informed him that he did not wish to meet further\nwith Dundas and Noordeloos.  Noordeloos became agitated when\nPlaintiff again stated he did not want to be an informant. \nNoordeloos concluded the conversation by telling Plaintiff: \n“Whenever you want to go home you come to the embassy.”  On   \nMay 4, 2010, a little more than a week after their final\nconversation, Noordeloos emailed Plaintiff as follows:\nYonas,\nThanks for meeting with us last week in Sudan.  While\nwe hope to get your side of issues we keep hearing\nabout, the choice is yours to make.  The time to help\nyourself is now.\nBe safe in Sudan,\nDave Noordeloos\nFAC ¶ 38.  Plaintiff remained in Khartoum for approximately two\nmonths during which time he noticed he was being followed by\npersons he assumed to be associated with the Sudanese secret\n8 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\npolice.  He learned from acquaintances that similar individuals\nhad been inquiring about him and his activities.  Plaintiff left\nSudan on approximately June 15, 2010.\nOn approximately September 15, 2010, Plaintiff traveled to\nthe United Arab Emirates (UAE) to pursue similar business\ninterests.  Plaintiff obtained a residency permit in the UAE in\norder to conduct business, and he invested substantial financial\nresources provided by his family for that purpose.\nOn the evening of June 1, 2011, Plaintiff was forcibly taken\nfrom his home by persons who he later learned were Emirati secret\npolice.  The police seized some of Plaintiff’s personal property,\nblindfolded him, and placed him in a heavily air-conditioned car. \nPlaintiff's captors drove him for approximately two hours to a\nbuilding where he was housed in a heavily air-conditioned,\nwindowless cell with only a bed.\nThe next morning Plaintiff was led to a room in which he\nwould undergo the first of repeated interrogations during 106\ndays of imprisonment.  During these interrogations Plaintiff was\nblindfolded while he was questioned in English for extended\nperiods of time.  Periodically Plaintiff was able to peek beneath\nhis blindfold and to view the shoes and lower torsos of his\ninterrogators, some of whom wore Western clothes.\nThe substance of the interrogations focused on the\nactivities, fundraising, and leadership of the As-Saber Mosque. \n9 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nIn addition, the interrogators questioned Plaintiff about\n“circumstances and events that [P]laintiff had disclosed” to\nNoordeloos and Dundas in Khartoum, and the interrogators urged\nPlaintiff “numerous times” to cooperate with the FBI by becoming\nan informant.\nPlaintiff was subjected to multiple threats and beatings\nthroughout the course of his confinement.  In response to his\nresistance to answering questions, Plaintiff was struck on the\nhead.  Plaintiff also was repeatedly beaten on his back, legs,\nand the soles of his feet with batons and plastic pipes.  When\nPlaintiff returned to his cell at the end of the first day of\ninterrogation, his bed had been removed and he had to sleep on\nthe floor of his cold cell.  When Plaintiff asked his\ninterrogators on several occasions whether his confinement and\ninterrogation were at the request of the FBI, the interrogators\nseverely beat him.\nOn June 14, 2011, Plaintiff took a “lie-detector test”\nduring which he was questioned about whether his “financial\narrangements involved soliciting funds for al-Qaeda,” but he was\nnot asked about the as-Saber Mosque.  That evening the bed was\nreturned to his cell.\nOn June 20, 2011, Plaintiff's family learned from\nPlaintiff's neighbors in the UAE that he was missing. \nPlaintiff's counsel notified the United States Consulate in Abu\n10 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nDhabi that Plaintiff had disappeared after being placed in an SUV\nof the type commonly used by the Emirati secret police.\nThe interrogations and beatings continued until July 28,\n2011, when Plaintiff met with a United States Department of State\nemployee named Marwa.  Before the meeting Plaintiff's captors\ninstructed him not to disclose his mistreatment.  During the\ninterview guards told Marwa that Plaintiff was being held without\ncharge as part of an ongoing investigation.  Despite Plaintiff\nlosing approximately 30 pounds since his kidnapping, Marwa found\nPlaintiff was in good health.  Plaintiff “attempted by facial\ncontortions and winks to indicate that he was under duress,” but\nMarwa either did not notice or disregarded the signals.\nThe interrogations and beatings resumed after Marwa's visit. \nFollowing the meeting interrogators repeatedly told Plaintiff\nthat he would be released “soon” or “tomorrow,” but he was not\nreleased.  Plaintiff considered refusing food in an attempt at\nsuicide, but he was told he would be force-fed.\nNear the end of his detention Plaintiff again asked an\ninterrogator whether the FBI had requested his detention and\ninterrogation.  This time the interrogator confirmed the FBI had\nmade such a request and that American and Emirati authorities\nwork closely on a number of such matters.\nOn September 14, 2011, Plaintiff was told he would be\nreleased that day.  Interrogators took money from Plaintiff's\n11 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nwallet to purchase an airline ticket back to the United States,\nbut they were told Plaintiff would not be allowed to return to\nthe United States by air because he was on the No-Fly List. \nThus, Plaintiff chose to fly to Sweden where, in the belief that\nhe might still be in danger of abuse in countries that condone\ntorture, Plaintiff submitted an application for asylum.\nBased on his experience with State Department officials in\nKhartoum and the UAE, Plaintiff does not believe he can rely on\nthe State Department to protect or to assist him while overseas.\nOn April 18, 2012, Plaintiff and his Swedish attorney held a\npress conference to detail his experiences in Sudan and the UAE\nand to announce that he would seek asylum in Sweden.  Less than\ntwo weeks later Plaintiff and two other individuals were indicted\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia for “conspiracy to structure monetary transfers” from\nhis family to him between April 14, 2010, and April 19, 2010. \nThe charges against Plaintiff were ultimately dismissed.\nIn the fall of 2013 Defendants’ counsel suggested Plaintiff\nshould visit the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm to make the necessary\narrangements to return to the United States.  Because the\ngovernment would not assure Plaintiff (1) that his safety from\n“extra-judicial actions” was guaranteed and (2) that he would be\npermitted to leave the United States after he returned, Plaintiff\ndeclined to return to the United States.\n12 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nIn November 2013 Plaintiff filed a DHS TRIP inquiry.  On\nJanuary 23, 2014, DHS informed Plaintiff that changes to his\nstatus were not warranted at that time.  DHS, however, did not\nverify Plaintiff’s status on the No-Fly List.  \nPlaintiff’s wife sought and received a divorce from\nPlaintiff because of the separation resulting from Plaintiff’s\ninability to return to the United States and because of the\nstigma attached to Plaintiff’s placement on the No-Fly List.\nIn early 2015 Plaintiff’s asylum application in Sweden was\ndenied.  On February 12, 2015, after the parties stipulated DHS\nwould reconsider Plaintiff's DHS TRIP application under the new\nprocedures in light of the Court's June 24, 2014, Opinion and\nOrder in Latif v. Holder, 28 F. Supp. 3d 1134 (D. Or. 2014), DHS\ninformed Plaintiff that he remained on the No-Fly List because he\nhad been “identified as an individual who may be a threat to\ncivil aviation or national security.”  DHS did not provide any\nadditional factual reasons for Plaintiff's designation.\nOn February 14, 2015, the Swedish government transported\nPlaintiff to Portland, Oregon, by private jet.\nAs noted, on May 9, 2016, Official Capacity Defendants filed\na Notice (#98) Regarding Plaintiff’s Status in which Official\nCapacity Defendants indicated Plaintiff had been removed from the\nNo-Fly List.\n13 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nIII. Defendants’ Surveillance of Plaintiff\nIn 2010 while Plaintiff was in the United States, he and his\nbrother, Dawit Woldehawariat, worked together to set up a\nbusiness venture abroad.  Plaintiff and Woldehawariat discussed\nthis venture by telephone, email, and text messages.\nAs a result of discovery and filings in the Southern\nDistrict of California criminal case against Plaintiff that was\nultimately dismissed, Plaintiff discovered Defendants intercepted\nthe contents of the communications between Plaintiff and\nWoldehawariat.  Plaintiff alleges Defendants did so without a\nwarrant or probable cause and that the electronic surveillance\ntook place under Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)\nauthority.  These intercepted communications formed the basis for\nthe meeting in the Khartoum Embassy and have been transmitted to\nseveral United States government agencies and foreign\ngovernments.\nSTANDARDS\nI. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\nWhen deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), the court may consider\naffidavits and other evidence supporting or attacking the\nplaintiff’s jurisdictional allegations.  Autery v. U.S., 424 F.3d\n944, 956 (9th Cir. 2005).  The court may permit discovery to\n14 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\ndetermine whether it has jurisdiction.  Data Disc, Inc. v. Sys.\nTech. Assoc., Inc., 557 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1977).  See\nalso Mujica v. AirScan, Inc., 771 F.3d 580, 617 (9th Cir. 2014). \nThe court has broad discretion in granting discovery and may\nnarrowly define the limits of such discovery.  Data Disc, Inc.,\n557 F.2d at 1285.  See also Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011,\n1020 (9th Cir. 2008).  When the court “receives only written\nsubmissions, the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing\nof jurisdiction.”  Rio Props., Inc. v. Rio Int'l Interlink, 284\nF.3d 1007, 1019 (9th Cir. 2002).  Plaintiff has the burden to\nestablish that the court has subject-matter jurisdiction.  Ass'n\nof American Med. Coll. v. United States, 217 F.3d 770 (9th Cir.\n2000).\nII. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6), the plaintiff’s complaint must contain\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atlantic v. Twombly,\n550 U.S. 544, 545 (2007).  A claim has facial plausibility when\nthe plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to\ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for\nthe misconduct alleged.  Id. at 556.  “The plausibility standard\nis not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more\nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” \n15 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)(quoting Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 546).  When a complaint pleads facts that are “merely\nconsistent with” a defendant's liability, it “stops short of the\nline between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to\nrelief.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n557).\nThe pleading standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n8 “does not require ‘detailed factual allegations,’ but it\ndemands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-\nme accusation.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 555).  See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  “A pleading\nthat offers ‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation\nof the elements of a cause of action will not do.’”  Twombly, 550\nU.S. at 555.  A complaint also does not suffice if it tenders\n“naked assertion[s]” devoid of “further factual enhancement.” \nId. at 557.\nDISCUSSION\nAs noted, Official Capacity Defendants move to dismiss each\nof the claims brought against them in Plaintiff’s FAC.3\nI. Plaintiff’s Due Process Claims:  Substantive Due Process\n(Claim One) and Procedural Due Process (Claim Three)\n3 In his FAC, Plaintiff only brings Claims One, Three, Four,\nand Twelve through Sixteen against Official Capacity Defendants.\n16 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nIn Claim One Plaintiff brings a substantive due-process\nclaim against Official Capacity Defendants in which Plaintiff\nasserts his placement on the No-Fly List violated his fundamental\nright to international travel.  In Claim Three Plaintiff brings a\nprocedural due-process claim against Official Capacity Defendants\nin which Plaintiff asserts they provided him with inadequate\nprocedural opportunities to have his name removed from the No-Fly\nList through the DHS TRIP process.  Plaintiff seeks declaratory\nand injunctive relief on Claims One and Three.\nOfficial Capacity Defendants move to dismiss Claims One and\nThree on the basis that those claims are moot as a result of\nPlaintiff’s removal from the No-Fly List.\nA. Mootness Standard\nThe limitation of the judicial branch in Article III of the\nUnited States Constitution to adjudicate “cases” and\n“controversies” requires “those who invoke the power of a federal\ncourt to demonstrate standing—a ‘personal injury fairly traceable\nto the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be\nredressed by the requested relief.’”  Already, LLC v. Nike Inc.,\n133 S. Ct. 721, 726 (2013)(quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,\n751 (1984)).  “[A]n ‘actual controversy’ must exist not only ‘at\nthe time the complaint is filed,’ but through ‘all stages’ of the\nlitigation.”  Already, LLC, 133 S. Ct. at 726 (quoting Alvarez v.\nSmith, 558 U.S. 87, 92 (2009)).  Moreover, a “‘plaintiff must\n17 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\ndemonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.’” \nMayfield v. United States, 599 F.3d 964, 969 (9th Cir. 2010)\n(quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Serv.,\nInc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000)). \n“A case becomes moot — and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or\n‘Controversy’ for purposes of Article III — ‘when the issues\npresented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally\ncognizable interest in the outcome.’”  Already, LLC, 133 S. Ct.\nat 726 (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1982)).  “No\nmatter how vehemently the parties continue to dispute the\nlawfulness of the conduct that precipitated the lawsuit, the case\nis moot if the dispute ‘is no longer embedded in any actual\ncontroversy about the plaintiffs' particular legal rights.’” \nAlready, 133 S. Ct. at 727 (quoting Alvarez, 558 U.S. at 93). \n“‘A case becomes moot whenever it loses its character as a\npresent, live controversy . . . .  The question is not whether\nthe precise relief sought at the time [the case] was filed is\nstill available.  The question is whether there can be any\neffective relief.’”  McCormack v. Herzog, 788 F.3d 1017, 1024\n(9th Cir. 2015)(quoting Siskiyou Reg’l Educ. Project v. U.S.\nForest Serv., 565 F.3d 545, 559 (9th Cir. 2009)(ellipses and\nbracketed text in original)).\n“The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not\nordinarily render a case moot because a dismissal for mootness\n18 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nwould permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as soon as\nthe case is dismissed.”  Knox v. Serv. Emp. Int’l Union, Local\n1000, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 2287 (2012).  See also Bell v. City of\nBoise, 709 F.3d 890, 898 (9th Cir. 2013).  “[V]oluntary cessation\ncan yield mootness if a ‘stringent’ standard is met:  ‘A case\nmight become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear\nthat the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be\nexpected to recur.’”  Rosebrock v. Mathis, 745 F.3d 963, 971 (9th\nCir. 2014)(quoting Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., 528 U.S. at 189).  See\nalso McCormack, 788 F.3d at 1024.\nB. Analysis\nWhen the government changes a policy, the court must presume\nthe government entity is acting in good faith.  Rosebrock, 745\nF.3d at 971.  Nonetheless, “when the Government asserts mootness\nbased on such a change it still must bear the heavy burden of\nshowing that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected\nto start up again.”  Id.  See also Bell, 709 F.3d at 898-99.  “A\npresumption of good faith, however, cannot overcome a court’s\nwariness of applying mootness under ‘protestations of repentance\nand reform, especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate\nsuit, and there is probability of resumption.’”  McCormack, 788\nF.3d at 1025 (quoting United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S.\n629, 632 n.5 (1953)).\n19 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\n“[W]hile a statutory change ‘is usually enough to render a\ncase moot,’ an executive action that is not governed by any clear\nor codified procedures cannot moot a claim.”  Id. (quoting Bell,\n709 F.3d at 898-900).  When determining whether an executive\naction “not reflected in statutory changes or even in changes in\nordinances or regulations” is sufficiently definitive to render a\ncase moot, the court considers the following factors:         \n(1) whether “the policy change is evidenced by language that is\n‘broad in scope and unequivocal in tone,’” (2) whether “the\npolicy change fully ‘addresses all of the objectionable measures\nthat [the Government] officials took against the plaintiffs in\nth[e] case,’” (3) whether the case in question was the “‘catalyst\nfor the agency's adoption of the new policy,’” (4) whether “the\npolicy has been in place for a long time when we consider\nmootness,” and (5) whether the government has engaged in conduct\nsimilar to that challenged by the plaintiff since the\nimplementation of the new policy.  Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 972\n(quoting White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1243-44 (9th Cir.\n2000)(bracketed text in original)).  “On the other hand, [the\ncourt is] less inclined to find mootness where the ‘new policy  \n. . . could be easily abandoned or altered in the future.’”\nRosebrock, 745 F.3d at 972 (quoting Bell, 709 F.3d at 901).\nThis Court addressed a similar situation in Tarhuni v.\nLynch, 129 F. Supp. 3d 1052 (D. Or. 2015).  In Tarhuni the\n20 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nplaintiff, who was also on the No-Fly List, brought substantive\nand procedural due-process claims regarding his placement on the\nNo-Fly List similar to those raised here.  During the course of\nthe Tarhuni litigation and after the government had been required\nto reconsider Tarhuni’s DHS TRIP inquiry pursuant to new\nprocedures that had been promulgated following this Court’s\nprevious decision in Latif, the defendants notified Tarhuni that\nhe had been removed from the List.  Tarhuni, however, maintained\nhis claims for prospective relief remained viable notwithstanding\nhis removal from the No-Fly List because he did not know the\nspecific reasons why he had been placed on the No-Fly List and\nthere was the possibility that the defendants would place him\nback on the No-Fly List after termination of the litigation. \nTarhuni, 129 F. Supp. 3d at 1060.\nThe Court, nevertheless, concluded Tarhuni’s claims were\nmoot.  The Court reasoned the defendants’ conduct was “not a\nvoluntary act in any real sense” because it came at the\nconclusion of a DHS TRIP reconsideration process that was put\ninto motion by the Court’s decision in Latif.  Id. at 1061.  The\nCourt noted the only relief that Tarhuni sought was “a\ndeclaration that Plaintiff's placement on the No–Fly List\nviolated his substantive due-process rights,” and, therefore, the\nCourt ultimately found “[s]uch a declaration would not have any\n21 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\neffect on Plaintiff’s substantive legal rights because Plaintiff\nis no longer on the No–Fly List.”  Id.\nEven if the voluntary-cessation doctrine applied, the Court\nalso concluded in Tarhuni that “Defendants have carried their\n‘heavy burden’ to demonstrate Plaintiff's placement on the No–Fly\nList based on current information will not recur.”  Id. at 1062\n(quoting Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 971).  Although the Court noted\nthe “Rosebrock factors do not fit neatly within the context of an\nindividualized determination,” the Court, nonetheless, concluded\nthe “principles expressed in Rosebrock support a finding that\nthis case is now moot” because the defendants’ statements\nregarding Tarhuni’s presence on the No-Fly List were\n“unequivocal” and the defendants had acted “in a manner\nconsistent with a genuine change in Defendants’ assessment of\nPlaintiff's inclusion on the List” for the more than six months\nsince Tarhuni had been taken off the list.  Tarhuni, 129 F. Supp.\n3d at 1062.  The Court pointed out that, unlike in McCormack,\nthere was “not any evidence in this record from which the Court\ncan conclude Defendants’ ‘abandonment seems timed to anticipate\nsuit, and there is probability of resumption,’” and, in fact,\n“the notion that the government would remove from the No–Fly List\nan individual whom Defendants believe is, in fact, ‘an individual\nwho represents a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent\nact of terrorism and who is operationally capable of doing so’\n22 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nfor the mere purpose of concluding this litigation is, to say the\nleast, far-fetched.”  Id. (quoting McCormack, 788 F.3d at 1025.\nThere are, however, some differences between this case and\nTarhuni.  In Tarhuni the plaintiff’s removal from the No-Fly List\nwas a direct result of a process that was initiated because of\nthe Court’s Order in Latif.  Here the connection between the\nCourt’s coercive Order in Latif and Plaintiff’s removal from the\nNo-Fly List is more attenuated.  Although Official Capacity\nDefendants reassessed Plaintiff’s DHS TRIP inquiry through the\nrevised procedures, that process concluded in March 2015 with a\ndetermination that Plaintiff should remain on the No-Fly List. \nIt was not until almost a year later that Official Capacity\nDefendants, apparently acting on their own initiative, removed\nPlaintiff from the List.  Accordingly, the Court concludes this\ncase is somewhat different than Tarhuni, and the voluntary-\ncessation doctrine applies to this case.\nAs it did in Tarhuni, however, the Court notes the Rosebrock\nanalysis “do[es] not fit neatly within the context of an\nindividualized determination.”  Tarhuni, 129 F. Supp. 3d at 1062. \nMany of the factors the Ninth Circuit set out in Rosebrock are\nbased on the assumption that the government action that\npotentially moots the lawsuit has general applicability and,\ntherefore, is capable of codification in statutes and\nregulations.  \n23 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nIn this case, however, the government action is inherently\nindividualized and is not a matter of legislative or executive\ndiscretion.  If an individual does not meet the substantive\ncriteria to be placed or maintained on the No-Fly List, the\ngovernment cannot place or keep that individual on the List.  As\nin Tarhuni, the circumstances in this case, therefore, are\nsomewhat different from those the Ninth Circuit addressed in\nRosebrock.\nNonetheless, the Court concludes Official Capacity\nDefendants’ removal of Plaintiff from the No-Fly List is a\nsufficiently definite action to render this case moot.  As in\nTarhuni, the government affirmatively informed Plaintiff that he\nhad been removed from the No-Fly List, and the government filed a\nNotice confirming that action in the public record of this case. \nAlso, like Tarhuni, more than six months have elapsed since\nOfficial Capacity Defendants took that action, and there is not\nany evidence in the record to suggest Plaintiff’s removal from\nthe No-Fly List is not “a genuine change in Defendants’\nassessment of Plaintiff’s inclusion on the List.”  Tarhuni, 129\nF. Supp. 3d at 1062.  Finally, as in Tarhuni, the notion that\ngovernment would remove an individual from the No–Fly List whom\nit believes is “‘a threat to civil aviation or national\nsecurity,’” for the “mere purpose of concluding this litigation\n24 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nis, to say the least, far-fetched.”4  See Tarhuni, 129 F. Supp.\n3d at 1062.  The Court, therefore, concludes Official Capacity\nDefendants have carried their “heavy burden” to demonstrate their\nplacement of Plaintiff on the No-Fly List based on current\ninformation will not recur.  See Rosebrock, 745 F.3d at 971.\nFinally, the prospective relief that Plaintiff seeks in this\ncase would no longer redress any nonconjectural injury, and,\ntherefore, there is “no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for\npurposes of Article III.”  See Already, LLC, 133 S. Ct. at 726\n(quoting Murphy, 455 U.S. at 481).  The relevant injunctive\nrelief that Plaintiff seeks in his substantive due-process claim\n(Claim One) would be an order requiring Official Capacity\nDefendants to remove Plaintiff’s name from the No-Fly List, which\nhas already occurred.5  \nPlaintiff, nonetheless, asserts his procedural due-process\nclaim (Claim Three) remains cognizable, and, therefore, Plaintiff\n4 This is especially true in light of the fact that many of\nthe legal issues raised in Plaintiff’s Claims One and Three\nremain at issue in Latif v. Lynch, No. 3:10-cv-00750-BR, as well\nas several other cases around the country.  To the extent that\nthe government may be concerned about the potential legal and\npolicy implications of those issues, mooting this case would do\nlittle to allay those concerns.\n5 Plaintiff now concedes a requested injunction directing\nOfficial Capacity Defendants to remove Plaintiff from the No-Fly\nList is now moot.  See Jt. Status Rept. (#100), May 16, 2016.\n25 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nstill seeks an order requiring Official Capacity Defendants to\ntake the following actions:\nf. Official Capacity defendants not condition the\nremoval of plaintiff’s name from the No-Fly List\nupon plaintiff’s agreeing to become an informant\nor agent provocateur on behalf of Official\nCapacity defendants;\ng. Official Capacity defendants not deny plaintiff\nwritten notice whenever his named is added to the\nNo-Fly List;\nh. Official Capacity defendants not deny plaintiff\nwritten notice whenever his name is removed from\nthe No-Fly List; [and]\ni. Official Capacity defendants [provide] plaintiff\nwith the specific reasons why his name was added\nto the No-Fly List;\nFAC at 44.  \nThe Court concludes the relief Plaintiff seeks in paragraphs\n(f), (g), and (h) is not cognizable because the circumstance that\ncould necessitate such relief in the future (i.e., Official\nCapacity Defendants again placing Plaintiff on the No-Fly List)\nis speculative.  Such “relief,” if imposed, would not redress any\nactual or imminent injury.  See Mayfield, 599 F.3d at 971 (“Once\na plaintiff has been wronged, he is entitled to injunctive relief\nonly if he can show that he faces a ‘real or immediate threat   \n. . . that he will again be wronged in a similar way.’”)(quoting\nLos Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983)).\nSimilarly, the relief sought in paragraph (i) of Plaintiff’s\nFAC would not redress any actual or imminent injury because it\n26 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nwould only be effective if Official Capacity Defendants placed\nPlaintiff on the No-Fly List again for the same or similar\nreasons.  That, however, is precisely the sort of “speculation or\n‘subjective apprehension’ about future harm” that does not\nsupport standing.  See Mayfield, 599 F.3d at 971 (quoting Laidlaw\nEnvtl. Servs., 528 U.S. at 184).  Thus, because Plaintiff’s\nremoval from the No-Fly List deprives Plaintiff of standing to\nseek prospective relief as to his No-Fly List claims against\nOfficial Capacity Defendants, the Court finds Plaintiff’s Claims\nOne and Three are moot.\nAccordingly, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff’s\nClaims One and Three as moot.  As in Tarhuni, however, the Court\nemphasizes the courthouse doors will be open to Plaintiff in the\nfuture if Official Capacity Defendants again place him on the No-\nFly List.\nII. Claim Four - Right to Freedom of Association\nIn Claim Four Plaintiff asserts all Defendants violated his\nright to freedom of association as guaranteed by the First\nAmendment when they placed him on the No-Fly List in order to\ncoerce him into becoming an agent provocateur pursuant to a\npolicy, custom, or practice of doing so.  \nBy Opinion and Order (#81) issued November 11, 2015, the\nCourt dismissed with prejudice an identical claim in Plaintiff’s\nCorrected Fourth Amended Complaint.  See Fikre v. Fed. Bur. of\n27 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nInvestigation, 142 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1166 (D. Or. 2015). \nAccordingly, the Court also dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff’s\nClaim Four in his FAC.\nIII. Plaintiff’s Surveillance Claims - Claims Twelve Through\nSixteen\nIn Claims Twelve through Sixteen, Plaintiff brings claims\nagainst Official Capacity Defendants for their alleged search and\nseizure of Plaintiff’s telephone communications, emails, and text\nmessages.  \nIn his FAC Plaintiff alleges the searches and seizures of\nhis communications were “not authorized by a warrant satisfying\nthe Fourth Amendment [and] were not supported by probable cause,”\nbut instead “were done under purported FISA authority.”  FAC ¶¶\n138, 144.  Plaintiff alleges the surveillance of his telephone\ncalls, text messages, and emails under the authority of FISA is\nongoing.  FAC ¶ 140.\nPlaintiff’s surveillance allegations stem from a disclosure\nby the government in a criminal case in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of California that\nindicated the government intended to introduce into evidence or\notherwise to use in that case “information obtained or derived\nfrom electronic surveillance and physical searches conducted\npursuant to (FISA)” against Plaintiff’s co-defendants in that\n28 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\ncase (Dawit Woldehawariat, who is, as noted, Plaintiff’s brother,\nand Abrehaile Haile).  \nIn the Southern District of California case, Plaintiff,\nWoldehawariat, and Haile were charged with structuring or\nattempting to structure monetary transactions to avoid federal\nfinancial-reporting regulations in violation of 31 U.S.C.       \n§ 5324(a)(3) and conspiracy to do so under 18 U.S.C. § 371.  In\naddition, Woldehawariat was charged with two counts of failure to\nfile a tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7203.  After\nWoldehawariat pled guilty to one count of failure to file a tax\nreturn, the government dismissed the other three counts against\nhim pursuant to a plea agreement.  The court also dismissed the\ncharges against Plaintiff and Haile on the government’s motion.   \nOfficial Capacity Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s\nClaims Twelve through Sixteen on the basis that Plaintiff fails\nto state a claim.\nA. Claim Twelve - Fourth Amendment\nIn Claim Twelve Plaintiff brings his claim under the Fourth\nAmendment contending Defendants intercepted, searched, and seized\nhis telephone calls, emails, and text messages without a “warrant\nsatisfying the Fourth Amendment,” probable cause, or reasonable\nsuspicion.  FAC ¶ 138. \n29 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nPlaintiff seeks a declaration that “the provisions of the\nPatriot Act and FISA which permit the federal government secretly\nto collect, disseminate, and retain information from a person and\nwhich allow one to perform electronic surveillance and wiretaps\nof a person without first demonstrating to a court the existence\nof probable cause that the person has committed a crime are\nunconstitutional.”  FAC ¶ 141.\nIn addition, Plaintiff seeks an injunction “requiring\n[D]efendants to return or destroy any of [P]laintiff’s\nunconstitutionally seized telephone calls, emails, or text\nmessages, or information derived therefrom, that [D]efendants\ncontinue to retain, and prohibiting any use or disclosure of\nthose communications and information.”  FACC ¶ 140. \nOfficial Capacity Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s\nClaim Twelve for failure to state a claim.  Official Capacity\nDefendants assert the only conclusion that can be drawn from\nPlaintiff’s FAC is that the surveillance took place pursuant to\nFISA and that the surveillance, therefore, did not violate the\nFourth Amendment.  Official Capacity Defendants specifically rely\non United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102 (2d Cir. 2010), for\nthe proposition that FISA is consistent with the Fourth Amendment\nand, therefore, Plaintiff’s Claim Twelve must be dismissed with\nprejudice because the surveillance was authorized by FISA.\n30 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nPlaintiff, on the other hand, contends:\nRegardless of whether the surveillance was done with or\nwithout FISA authorization, it does not change the\noutcome where plaintiff has alleged that the\ninterception, search, and seizure of plaintiff’s\ntelephone calls, emails, and text messages were not\nauthorized by a warrant satisfying the Fourth\nAmendment, were not supported by probable cause or\nreasonable suspicion, and did not contain particulars\nregarding the persons, premises and things to be\nsearched.\nPl.’s Resp. (#95) at 15.  In any event, Plaintiff contends this\nCourt should follow a previous case in this District in which the\ncourt concluded surveillance conducted pursuant to FISA violated\nthe Fourth Amendment.  See Mayfield v. United States, 504 F.\nSupp. 2d 1023, 1036-42 (D. Or. 2007), vacated on justiciability\ngrounds by Mayfield, 599 F.3d 964.\nWith the exception of the Mayfield decision in this District\nthat was later vacated on justiciability grounds by the Ninth\nCircuit, Official Capacity Defendants are correct that there is\nbroad consensus that surveillance conducted pursuant to FISA does\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment.  See Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at\n120 (collecting cases).  See also United States v. Duka, 671 F.3d\n329, 341 (3d Cir. 2011).  Moreover, after multiple opportunities\nto re-plead, Plaintiff’s FAC remains devoid of nonconclusory\nallegations from which this Court could find the alleged\nsurveillance was not authorized by FISA.  Instead Plaintiff sets\n31 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nout a series of conclusory reasons in his FAC as to why he\nbelieves any FISA authorization may have been legally deficient:\n146.  Plaintiff and his brother are not foreign\npowers or agents of foreign powers, and there has never\nbeen any probable cause to believe so.  The information\nobtained from defendants’ electronic surveillance of\ntheir communications is not foreign intelligence\ninformation.  Obtaining foreign intelligence was not\nthe primary purpose and was not a significant purpose\nof defendants’ electronic surveillance of plaintiff’s\ncommunications.  The information defendants obtained\nfrom their electronic surveillance of plaintiff’s\ncommunications could have been obtained by normal\ninvestigative techniques, e.g., normal criminal wiretap\nwarrants conforming to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant\nrequirement.\n147.  The electronic surveillance was not\nauthorized or conducted pursuant to the strict FISA\nprocedural requirements, certifications, and privacy\nprotections for U.S. persons, and/or the minimization\nprocedures that apply only to foreign intelligence and\nnot open-ended domestic intelligence activities.\nFAC ¶¶ 146-47.  Such allegations, however, are precisely the kind\nof “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action [that] will not do.”  See Twombly,\n550 U.S. at 555.  The only plausible, factual conclusion that can\nbe drawn from Plaintiff’s FAC, therefore, is that Official\nCapacity Defendants conducted surveillance that captured\nPlaintiff’s communications pursuant to FISA.  Because Plaintiff\nhas not established such surveillance violates the Fourth\nAmendment as a matter of law, the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s\nClaim Twelve.\n32 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nThe Court notes Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)\nprovides a party may amend a pleading after a response has been\nfiled only by leave of court unless the opposing party consents\nto the amendment.  Rule 15(a), however, also provides leave to\namend “shall be freely given when justice so requires.”  This\npolicy is to be applied with “extreme liberality.”  Moss v.\nUnited States Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 972 (9th Cir. 2009).\nThe Supreme Court has recognized several factors that a\ndistrict court should consider when determining whether justice\nrequires the court to grant leave to amend.  Those factors\ninclude\nundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part\nof the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by\namendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the\nopposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,\nfutility of the amendment.\nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  See also Eminence\nCapital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.\n2003).  The factor that carries the greatest weight is whether\nthe amendment will prejudice the opposing party.  Eminence\nCapital, 316 F.3d at 1052.  “Absent prejudice or a strong showing\nof any of the remaining Foman factors, there exists a presumption\nunder Rule 15(a) in favor of granting leave to amend.”  Id. \n“Delay alone is insufficient to justify denial of leave to amend;\nthe party opposing amendment must also show that the amendment\n33 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nsought is futile, in bad faith or will cause undue prejudice to\nthe opposing party.”  Jones v. Bates, 127 F.3d 839, 847 n.8 (9th\nCir.1997)(citing United States v. Webb, 655 F.2d 977, 980 (9th\nCir. 1981)).  See also Quantum Tech. Partners II, L.P. v. Altman\nBrowning and Co., No. 08-CV-376-BR, 2009 WL 1795574, at *19 (D.\nOr. June 23, 2009)(same).  The party who opposes amendment bears\nthe burden to show prejudice.  Eminence Capital, 316 F.3d at 1052\n(citing DCD Programs, Ltd. v. Leighton, 833 F.2d 183, 187 (9th\nCir. 1987)).\nIn the Court’s Opinion and Order (#81) in which it dismissed\nin part Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Complaint (Corrected), the\nCourt noted the multiple opportunities that Plaintiff had been\ngiven to produce a viable complaint.  In particular, the Court\nobserved:\nIn the Court’s view, the unusually protracted Rule 12\nlitigation arises from the moving target that Plaintiff\ncreated in his pleadings and that has already\nsignificantly delayed this action and potentially\nprejudiced the Official Capacity Defendants in light of\ntheir interest in a reasonably speedy resolution of\nthis matter on the merits.  The Court concludes there\nis now an urgent need to move this matter beyond Rule\n12 litigation and toward resolution on the merits.\nFikre, 142 F. Supp. 3d at 1170-71.  Nonetheless, the Court\nprovided Plaintiff with “one final opportunity to amend” his\nComplaint.  Id. at 1711.  \n34 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nAt this point (which is more than three years after\nPlaintiff filed this litigation) if the Court provided Plaintiff\nwith another opportunity to amend his Complaint, Official\nCapacity Defendants, who have been required to participate in\nmultiple rounds of Rule 12 litigation, would be unduly\nprejudiced.  In addition, the repeated opportunities that\nPlaintiff has had to amend his various Complaints and Plaintiff’s\napparent inability to plead additional and more specific facts\nindicates any further opportunities to amend would be futile.\nOn this record, therefore, the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s\nClaim Twelve with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\nB. Claim Thirteen - FISA  \nIn Claim Thirteen Plaintiff seeks to state a claim for\ndamages against the Official Capacity Defendants’ for alleged\nFISA violations pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2712(a).  Official\nCapacity Defendants move to dismiss Claim Sixteen on the basis\nthat Plaintiff fails to state a claim under FISA.\nPlaintiff’s sole remaining claim for damages under FISA\narises from the allegation that Official Capacity Defendants\nwillfully failed to employ and to follow sufficient minimization\nprocedures on the disclosure of information seized pursuant to\n35 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nFISA in violation of 50 U.S.C. § 1806(a).6  Section 1806(a)\nprovides:\nInformation acquired from an electronic surveillance\nconducted pursuant to this subchapter concerning any\nUnited States person may be used and disclosed by\nFederal officers and employees without the consent of\nthe United States person only in accordance with the\nminimization procedures required by this subchapter. \nNo otherwise privileged communication obtained in\naccordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of\nthis subchapter shall lose its privileged character. \nNo information acquired from an electronic surveillance\npursuant to this subchapter may be used or disclosed by\nFederal officers or employees except for lawful\npurposes.\nPursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2712(a) Plaintiff may only obtain damages\nfor a violation of § 1806(a) if he proves such a violation was\nwillful.  See Fikre, 142 F. Supp. 3d at 1169-70.\nOfficial Capacity Defendants assert Plaintiff’s Claim\nThirteen must be dismissed because (1) Plaintiff does not provide\na plausible, nonconclusory allegation that any surveillance\ninformation relating to Plaintiff was actually disclosed; (2)\nPlaintiff’s FAC does not contain any nonconclusory allegations as\nto what the minimization procedures were and which of those\nprocedures were violated, and (3) Plaintiff fails to allege\n6 Plaintiff’s FAC purports to include claims for damages\narising from alleged violations of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(i) and\n1804(a).  This Court, however, previously dismissed those claims\nwith prejudice on the basis that Plaintiff failed to identify a\nvalid waiver of sovereign immunity.  See Fikre, 142 F. Supp. 3d\nat 1168-69.  \n36 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nnonconclusory facts from which the Court could find Plaintiff has\npled a claim for willful violation sufficient to waive sovereign\nimmunity under   § 2712(a).\nPlaintiff, on the other hand, contends his allegation that\n“the information upon which defendants caused Plaintiff to meet\nwith Defendant FBI agents Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason\nDundas) in Khartoum and upon which defendants caused the UAE to\nimprison and torture plaintiff was derived from illegal\nsurveillance and searches” is sufficient to establish at this\nstage of the proceedings that there was a disclosure of the FISA-\nderived information that is actionable under § 1806(a). \nMoreover, Plaintiff contends he could not more specifically\nallege a failure to follow or to employ minimization procedures\nbecause those procedures are secret.\nStanding alone, the Court is not troubled by Plaintiff’s\nfailure to include specific allegations about the minimization\nprocedures associated with the FISA-derived email, text messages,\nand telephone conversations between Plaintiff and his brother. \nThe Court notes Rule 12 does not require a plaintiff to plead\nwhat he cannot possibly know.  Nonetheless, the remainder of\nPlaintiff’s allegations are insufficient to cross “‘the line\nbetween possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’” \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). \n37 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nPlaintiff’s nonconclusory factual allegations regarding the\nconnection between the FISA-derived materials and his\ninterrogation and torture in the UAE are as follows:\n77. In 2010, while he was inside the United\nStates, plaintiff and his brother Dawit Woldehawariat -\nboth US citizens - worked together to set up a lawful\nbusiness venture abroad.  In furtherance of this\nobjective, plaintiff and his brother discussed the\nparameters of the business venture they envisioned and\nthe financial resources necessary to execute their\nplan.  These discussions occurred by telephone, email,\nand text message.\n78. Unbeknownst at the time to either plaintiff\nor his brother, defendants were intercepting and/or\nacquiring the content of plaintiff’s telephone calls,\nhis text messages, and his emails.  Plaintiff now knows\nthis because the United States has confirmed, through\nDepartment of Justice filings submitted in a\nsince-dismissed prosecution against plaintiff in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District\nof California, that it intercepted the contents of\nplaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text messages. \nSee U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia, Docket No. 3:12-cr-06189-JAH, Doc. # 10.\nFAC ¶¶ 77-78.  In his FAC Plaintiff alleges the general content\nof the FISA-derived communications was discussed when Noordeloos\nand Dundas interrogated him.\n35. Because defendants John Doe I (Jason Dundas)\nand Noordeloos were blocking the door, plaintiff, who\nhad never before been detained or arrested, felt he\ncould not leave.  During the following interrogation,\ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas)\nquestioned plaintiff extensively about the events,\nactivities, and leadership at the as-Saber Mosque in\nPortland, which plaintiff had attended for prayer\nservices.  Defendant Noordeloos also questioned\nplaintiff about the source of his financial support for\nthis business endeavors in Sudan, and told plaintiff\n38 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nthat, because of the Sudan sanctions imposed by the\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control, it was illegal for\nplaintiff to engage in business transactions in Sudan -\na statement that is inconsistent with the advice and\nrecommendation earlier given by the representative of\nthe embassy as set forth in ¶ 29, supra.\nFAC ¶ 35.  After Plaintiff moved from Sudan to the UAE and was\nimprisoned by Emirati agents, Plaintiff alleged he was\ninterrogated regarding the following subjects:\n44. The primary focus of the blindfolded\ninterrogations was events at Portland’s as-Saber\nMosque, addressing in particular who plaintiff knew at\nthe mosque who had a “jihadi mentality,” what topics\nthe mosque’s leader, Sheikh Mohamed Kariye, speaks\nabout both in public and in private, and how\nfundraising at the mosque occurs and who engages in\nfundraising there.  The interrogators also questioned\nplaintiff about circumstances and events that plaintiff\nhad disclosed to defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I\n(Jason Dundas) during his interrogation at the embassy\nin Khartoum.  Numerous times during the blindfolded\ninterrogations plaintiff’s interrogators urged him to\ncooperate with them and with the FBI by becoming an\ninformant.\n* * *\n47. On several occasions plaintiff told his\ninterrogators that the questions he was being asked and\nthe suggestions of cooperation with the FBI were the\nsame questions and suggestion he had heard from\ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas); he\nthus inquired whether his confinement and mistreatment\nwas at the request of the FBI.  On each such occasion\nthe interrogators responded by beating plaintiff\nseverely.\n* * *\n50. On or about June 14, 2011, plaintiff was\ninformed that he had to take a lie detector test. \nDuring the test, for the only time during his\n39 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nconfinement, plaintiff was questioned without a\nblindfold in place.  The questioning during the test\nfocused not upon events at Portland’s as-Saber Mosque\nbut, rather, upon whether plaintiff’s financial\narrangements involved soliciting funds for al-Qaeda. \nFollowing the lie detector test plaintiff’s bed and\nbedding were returned to his cell.\nFAC ¶¶ 44, 47, 50.  From these facts Plaintiff concludes:\n80. On information and belief, the information\nupon which defendants caused plaintiff to meet with\ndefendant FBI agents Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason\nDundas) in Khartoum and upon which defendants caused\nthe UAE to imprison and torture plaintiff was derived\nfrom illegal surveillance and searches.\n81. On information and belief, information\nderived from the electronic surveillance of plaintiff\nwas willfully, knowingly, and/or recklessly\ndisseminated for the unlawful purpose of interrogating\nplaintiff without counsel and coercing plaintiff to\nbecome an informant and then to cause his torture by\nproxy in the UAE.\n82. On information and belief, the information\nderived from the electronic surveillance of plaintiff\nwas disseminated to several agencies and foreign\ngovernments including but not limited to the Central\nIntelligence Agency, the National Security Council, the\nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Homeland\nSecurity, the Department of Justice/Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, the US Attorney’s Office for the\nDistrict of Oregon, the Department of the Treasury and\nthe National Security Agency, and the United Arab\nEmirates.\nFAC ¶¶ 80-82.\nPlaintiff’s conclusion that the FISA-derived communications\nprovided the basis for his interrogation in Khartoum and torture\nand interrogation in the UAE, therefore, is based on the rough\ncommonality of the general subject matter brought up in all three\n40 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nevents.  In particular, the Court notes the subject matter of his\nalleged communications with his brother was very specific; i.e.,\n“plaintiff and his brother discussed the parameters of the\nbusiness venture they envisioned and the financial resources\nnecessary to execute their plan.”  FAC ¶ 77.  Plaintiff’s\ninterrogation in Khartoum, on the other hand, concerned\nactivities at the as-Saber Mosque and “the source of his\nfinancial support for his business endeavors in Sudan.”  FAC    \n¶ 44.  His interrogation in the UAE concerned activities at the\nas-Saber Mosque, “circumstances and events that plaintiff had\ndisclosed to defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas)\nduring his interrogation at the embassy in Khartoum,” and\n“whether plaintiff’s financial arrangements involved soliciting\nfunds for al-Qaeda.”  FAC ¶¶ 44, 50.\nThe relationship between these three events (the FISA\nsurveillance, the Khartoum interrogation, and the UAE\ninterrogation) as alleged by Plaintiff is tenuous.  Foe example,\nPlaintiff does not allege he was ever questioned either in\nKhartoum or in the UAE about the communications with his brother,\nwhich allegedly was the subject of the FISA surveillance. \nAlthough the Court appreciates allegations concerning a\ndisclosure of FISA-derived information will often have to be\ncircumstantial, a plaintiff remains required to “plead[] factual\n41 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal,\n556 U.S. at 678.  In this case the relationship between the\nallegedly FISA-derived material and the alleged interrogations is\ntoo attenuated to permit the Court to reasonably infer that\nOfficial Capacity Defendants disclosed the FISA-derived\ninformation in a manner that would support a claim for damages\nunder § 1806(a) and § 2712(a).\nOn this record and for the same reasons as with Claim\nTwelve, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff’s Claim\nThirteen for failure to state a claim.\nC. Claim Fourteen - Stored Communications Act\nIn Claim Fourteen Plaintiff brings claims for violation of\nthe Stored Communications Act (SCA), 18 U.S.C. § 2703, and states\na cause of action for damages under § 2712.  Plaintiff’s\ncontention is that Official Capacity Defendants unlawfully\ncompelled the production of stored communications from service\nproviders in violation of the procedures set out in § 2703.\nOfficial Capacity Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s\nClaim Fourteen on the basis that 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(a)(ii)\nprovides a safe-harbor provision for government agents who\nconduct surveillance pursuant to FISA authorization.  Section\n2511(2)(a)(ii) provides:\n42 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nNotwithstanding any other law, providers of wire or\nelectronic communication service, their officers,\nemployees, and agents, landlords, custodians, or other\npersons, are authorized to provide information,\nfacilities, or technical assistance to persons\nauthorized by law to intercept wire, oral, or\nelectronic communications or to conduct electronic\nsurveillance, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, if such\nprovider, its officers, employees, or agents, landlord,\ncustodian, or other specified person, has been provided\nwith–-\n(A) a court order directing such assistance or a\ncourt order pursuant to section 704 of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 signed by\nthe authorizing judge, or\n(B) a certification in writing by a person\nspecified in section 2518(7) of this title or the\nAttorney General of the United States that no\nwarrant or court order is required by law, that\nall statutory requirements have been met, and that\nthe specified assistance is required,\nPlaintiff concedes § 2511(2)(a)(ii) would provide a safe\nharbor for Official Capacity Defendants if the surveillance was,\nin fact, authorized by FISA, but Plaintiff contends the\nsurveillance in this case was not properly authorized by FISA. \nAs noted, however, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege the\nFISA surveillance was not properly authorized.  \nAccordingly, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff’s\nClaim Fourteen pursuant to § 2511(2)(a)(ii).\nD. Claim Fifteen - Wiretap Act \nIn Claim Fifteen Plaintiff brings a cause of action for\ndamages pursuant to § 2712 in which Plaintiff alleges Official\n43 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nCapacity Defendants violated the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2511. \nOfficial Capacity Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s Claim\nFifteen for failure to state a claim on primarily the same basis\nas Claim Fourteen:  Official Capacity Defendants contend        \n§ 2511(2)(e) precludes liability under the Wiretap Act when the\nsurveillance is conducted pursuant to FISA.\nSection § 2511(2)(e) provides:\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this title or\nsection 705 or 706 of the Communications Act of 1934,\nit shall not be unlawful for an officer, employee, or\nagent of the United States in the normal course of his\nofficial duty to conduct electronic surveillance, as\ndefined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act of 1978, as authorized by that Act.\nAs the Court noted in its November 4, 2015, Opinion and Order\n(#81), “[a]lthough the Official Capacity Defendants are correct\nthat § 2511(2)(e) permits surveillance that is conducted pursuant\nto FISA, Official Capacity Defendants’ contention that          \n§ 2511(2)(e) immunizes Defendants’ conduct is, once again,\npremature on this record because Plaintiff has not alleged\nDefendants conducted the surveillance in this case pursuant to\nFISA.”  Fikre, 142 F. Supp. 3d at 1173.  Official Capacity\nDefendants’ contention is no longer premature.  As noted, in his\nFAC Plaintiff alleges the surveillance was conducted under FISA\nauthority.  \n44 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nAccordingly, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff’s\nClaim Fifteen.\nE. Claim Sixteen - Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n41(g)\nIn Claim Sixteen Plaintiff raises a stand-alone claim under\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g) in which Plaintiff seeks\nthe return of allegedly illegally searched and seized property. \nAccordingly, Plaintiff seeks an order directing Official Capacity\nDefendants to return or to destroy the records of telephone\ncalls, emails, text messages, and derivative information that\nPlaintiff alleges Official Capacity Defendants seized\nunconstitutionally.\nIn its November 4, 2015, Opinion and Order (#81), however,\nthe Court found Plaintiff’s claim under Rule 41(g) was not\ncognizable as a stand-alone claim because “Rule 41(g) provides a\nremedy in civil cases in which Plaintiff establishes a Fourth\nAmendment violation” and the relief sought in Plaintiff’s Rule\n41(g) claim was “functionally identical to the injunction that he\nseeks in Claim Fifteen to remedy Defendants’ alleged Fourth\nAmendment violation.”  Fikre, 142 F. Supp. 3d at 1173.  The\nCourt, therefore, dismissed Plaintiff’s Rule 41(g) claim “without\nprejudice to Plaintiff seeking relief authorized by Rule 41(g) in\nthe event that Plaintiff prevails on Claim Fifteen.”  Id.\n45 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nAs noted, the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment\nclaim (Claim Twelve) on the basis that Plaintiff has failed to\nstate a claim in light of his allegation that the surveillance\nwas conducted pursuant to FISA.  Accordingly, because Plaintiff’s\nClaim Sixteen operates only as a potential remedy for Plaintiff’s\nClaim Twelve under the Fourth Amendment, the Court also dismisses\nPlaintiff’s Claim Sixteen with prejudice.\nIV. Official Capacity Defendants’ Unopposed Motion (#91) to Stay\nPlaintiff’s Due Process Claims\nIn their Unopposed Motion (#91) to Stay Plaintiff’s Due\nProcess Claims, Official Capacity Defendants request the Court\nstay adjudication of Plaintiff’s procedural and substantive due-\nprocess claims until the Court addresses similar claims in Latif\nv. Lynch, No. 3:10-cv-00750-BR.\nIn light of this Court’s conclusion that Plaintiff’s Claims\nOne and Three are now moot as a result of Plaintiff’s removal\nfrom the No-Fly List, the Court finds Official Capacity\nDefendants’ Motion to Stay Plaintiff’s Due Process Claims is also\nmoot.\nThe Court, therefore, DENIES as moot Official Capacity\nDefendants’ Motion (#91) to Stay Plaintiff’s Due Process Claims. \nCONCLUSION\n46 - OPINION AND ORDER\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS Official\nCapacity Defendants’ Motion (#90) to Dismiss and DISMISSES with\nprejudice Plaintiff’s Fifth Amended Complaint as to Plaintiff’s\nclaims against Official Capacity Defendants.  The Court also\nDENIES as moot Official Capacity Defendants’ Unopposed Motion\n(#91) to Stay Plaintiff’s Due Process Claims.\nAfter more than three years of litigation the record still\nreflects none of Individual Capacity Defendants identified in\nPlaintiff’s FAC have been served.  Accordingly, pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m), the Court directs Plaintiff\nto show cause in writing no later than October 14, 2016, why this\naction should not be dismissed as to Individual Capacity\nDefendants.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED this 28th day of September, 2016.  \n   /s/ ANNA J.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiff Yonas Fikre seeks redress for denial of his rights as a citizen of \nthe United States, which denial effectively rendered him stateless. Plaintiff also seeks \nredress for suffering torture at the hands of a foreign power, which torture, on \ninformation and belief, was instigated by and facilitated by defendants.  \n2.   Plaintiff's fundamental claims are (i) that defendants sometime prior to \nApril 21, 2010, placed plaintiff's name on the \"No-Fly List\" in order to coerce plaintiff into \nbecoming an informant for the FBI, (ii) that on April 21, 2010, during an involuntary \ninterview at the United States Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, defendants denied \nplaintiff's request for legal counsel, (iii) that during the April 2010 involuntary interview \nplaintiff was urged to become an FBI informant in order to, among other things, have his \nname removed from the No-Fly List, (iv) that when plaintiff refused to become an \ninformant defendants retaliated by instigating and facilitating his torture at the hands of \nthe United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\") government during the summer of 2011, (v) that \ndefendants denied plaintiff his constitutional right as a citizen to return home to the \nUnited States following the UAE government's releasing him without charge by keeping \nhis name on the No-Fly List, thus effectively rendering him stateless, and (vi) that in \nMay 2012 defendants further retaliated against plaintiff for his publicly disclosing his \nordeal.  \n3.  Through this action for declaratory and injunctive relief and for damages \nplaintiff seeks (i) a declaration that plaintiff's right to assistance of legal counsel has \nbeen violated, (ii) redress for the United States' instigating and facilitating his torture by \nthe UAE government, (iii) an injunction preventing the United States from violating the \nPage 2 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 3 of 20    Page ID#: 3\nrights specified herein in the future, and (iv) monetary damages from the individual \ndefendants acting in their personal capacities for the events specified in this complaint.  \nII. PARTIES \n  4.  Plaintiff is a naturalized American citizen of Eritrean descent. He is not a \ncitizen of Eritrea.  \n  5.  Defendant Federal Bureau of Investigation is a bureau of the Department \nof Justice responsible for, among other things, selecting individuals for inclusion on, and \nmaintaining, the No-Fly List.  \n  6.  Defendant Eric Holder is Attorney General, whose office is responsible for, \namong other agencies, the FBI and the Terrorism Screening Center. Mr. Holder is sued \nonly in his official capacity. \n  7.  Defendant Department of State is the Department of the United States \nresponsible for protecting and assisting United States citizens while those citizens are \nabroad.  \n  8.  Defendant John Kerry is Secretary of State, who is responsible for foreign \nrelations and for protecting and assisting United States citizens while abroad. Mr. Kerry \nis sued only in his official capacity. \n  9.  Defendant Robert S. Mueller III is Director of the FBI. He is sued only in \nhis official capacity. \n  10.  Defendant Timothy Healy is Director of the Terrorism Screening Center. \nHe is sued only in his official capacity. \n  11.  At all times relevant, a person identifying himself as defendant Jason \nDundas, who is sued in his individual capacity, was an employee of the FBI assigned to \nPage 3 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 4 of 20    Page ID#: 4\nthe Portland office. Defendant Dundas traveled to Khartoum, Sudan, in April 2010, in \norder to interrogate plaintiff Yonas Fikre at the United States Embassy in Khartoum, and \non April 22, 2010, defendant Dundas did so interrogate plaintiff for several hours.  \n12.  At all times relevant, defendant David Noordeloos, who is sued in his \nindividual capacity, was an employee of the FBI assigned to and/or reporting to the \nPortland office of the FBI. Defendant Noordeloos traveled to Khartoum, Sudan, in April \n2010, in order to interrogate plaintiff at the United States Embassy in Khartoum, and on \nApril 22, 2010, Defendant Noordeloos did so interrogate plaintiff for several hours. \nIII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  13.  This is a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief, and for damages, \nbased upon defendants’ violation of plaintiff’s’ rights as a citizen of the United States. \nThe claims asserted arise under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (substantive and procedural), and the \nFifth Amendment’s prohibition against self-incrimination.   \n  14.  This Court has jurisdiction over claims against the United States pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Jurisdiction over the individual defendants sued in their personal \ncapacities is authorized and instituted pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n  15.  The Court has the authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n16.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because \ndefendants are agencies of the United States and because this judicial district is where \nplaintiff resides and where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nPage 4 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 5 of 20    Page ID#: 5\nclaims occurred. Venue is also proper in this Court because two of the individuals sued \nin their personal capacities at all times relevant hereto either resided in, worked in, or \nwere assigned to and/or reported to this District. \nIV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  17.  Air travel is the only practical means of passenger transportation between \nthe North American continent and Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. \n  18.  Defendant FBI is responsible for the maintenance of the \"No-Fly List,\" \nwhich lists individuals whom the airlines flying within, into, or over the United States may \nnot transport. \n  19.  Most individuals on the No-Fly List, and plaintiff in this action, are \nprohibited from flying into, out of, or over United States and Canadian airspace.  \n  20.  Plaintiff is a 33-year-old naturalized American citizen of Eritrean descent. \nWhen he was a small boy war broke out in Eritrea, and thus his family took him to \nSudan, where he was when the State of Eritrea came into being in 1993; consequently, \nplaintiff is not a citizen of Eritrea. From Sudan the Fikre family emigrated to the United \nStates. \n  21.  Beginning in 2006, plaintiff resided in Portland, Oregon. In late December \n2009, after working for an American cell phone company, plaintiff decided attempt to \ndistribute and retail sale of consumer electronic products in East Africa. He began by \nreturning to Sudan, where some of his extended family still reside. Upon arrival in \nSudan plaintiff, in compliance with a recommendation by State Department, contacted \nthe United States Consulate in Khartoum and informed a representative of the \nconsulate of his interest in pursuing business opportunities in the country. The \nPage 5 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 6 of 20    Page ID#: 6\nrepresentative encouraged plaintiff to pursue business opportunities in Sudan. In \nreliance upon the representative's recommendation plaintiff began the process of \nobtaining a Sudanese business license. \n  22.  On or about April 21, 2010, plaintiff was informed by his wife in the United \nStates that she had received a telephone call from the United States Embassy in \nKhartoum requesting that plaintiff contact defendant Noordeloos, who claimed to be an \nofficial at the embassy and whose telephone number his wife gave to plaintiff. On the \nsame day, at approximately 9 p.m. local time, plaintiff called the number given and \nspoke with defendant Noordeloos. Defendant Noordeloos stated that a number of \nAmericans in Sudan had been invited to the Embassy for a luncheon the following day \nin order to discuss how Americans might stay safe during a period of political turmoil in \nSudan. Plaintiff agreed to attend the luncheon on that basis. \n23.  The next morning plaintiff appeared at the embassy. After going through \nsecurity screening, plaintiff met defendant Noordeloos and another person who \nidentified himself as defendant Jason Dundas. Defendants Noordeloos and Dundas \nescorted plaintiff to a small meeting room and shut the door; defendants positioning \nthemselves between plaintiff and the door. At that point defendants Noordeloos and \nDundas produced badges and stated that they were FBI agents assigned to the \nPortland office.  \n24.  Upon being informed that defendants Noordeloos and Dundas were FBI \nagents from the Portland office, plaintiff stated that he wanted to be represented by his \nlegal counsel (plaintiff was then represented by Oregon attorney Brandon Mayfield) \nduring the interrogation. Defendant Noordeloos denied Mr. Fikre’s request for such \nPage 6 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 7 of 20    Page ID#: 7\nrepresentation on the grounds that plaintiff had been placed on the No-Fly List and thus \ncould not return to the United States to confer with his attorney.  \n25.  Because defendants Dundas and Noordeloos were blocking the door, \nplaintiff felt he could not leave. During the following interrogation defendants Noordeloos \nand Dundas questioned plaintiff extensively about the events, activities, and leadership \nat the As-Saber Mosque in Portland, which plaintiff had attended for prayer services. \nDefendant Noordeloos also questioned plaintiff about the source of his financial support \nfor this business endeavors in Sudan, and told plaintiff that, because of the Sudan \nsanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, it was illegal for plaintiff to \nengage in business transactions in Sudan - a statement that is inconsistent with the \nadvice and recommendation earlier given by the representative of the embassy.  \n26.  Defendant Noordeloos next told plaintiff that the FBI desired plaintiff to \nbecome an FBI informant to work upon “a case” that was then developing. Defendant \nNoordeloos stated that, in return, plaintiff would be paid substantial compensation, be in \na position to enjoy “the good life,” and that the FBI would take steps to remove plaintiff \nfrom the No-Fly List. Defendant Noordeloos then asked, \"Don't you love your wife?\", \nwhich question plaintiff considered an implicit threat. Plaintiff responded that he did not \nwish to become an FBI informant. The interview lasted for several hours until the close \nof the business day. As the day wore on, defendant Noordeloos suggested that they \nresume the discussion on the following day; in order to escape the interrogation room \nand leave the embassy, plaintiff agreed. \n27.  At approximately 8:45 a.m. on the following morning, plaintiff called \ndefendant Noordeloos and stated that he did not wish to meet further with the FBI \nPage 7 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 8 of 20    Page ID#: 8\nagents because he would be wasting their and his time; he reiterated that he did not \nwish to become an informant for the FBI. Defendant Noordeloos became agitated and, \nto the best of plaintiff's recollection, stated, \"Wait a minute! Are you trying to tell me you \ndon't want to work with us!\" Defendant Noordeloos then stated that, \"Whenever you \nwant to go home you come to the embassy.\"  \n28.  On May 4, 2011, defendant Noordeloos wrote an email to plaintiff which \nstated: \nYonas, \nThanks for meeting with us last week in Sudan. While we hope to get your \nside of issues we keep hearing about, the choice is yours to make. The \ntime to help yourself is now. \nBe safe in Sudan, \nDave Noordeloos \n \n29.  Plaintiff remained in Khartoum for almost two months following his \nmeeting with defendants Noordeloos and Dundas. During that time he noticed that he \nwas being followed by persons he assumed were affiliated with the Sudanese secret \npolice, and he was told my merchants and other acquaintances that similar individuals \nhad been inquiring about him and his activities. \n30.  On or about June 15, 2010, plaintiff left Sudan, and on or about \nSeptember 15, 2010, plaintiff arrived in the United Arab Emirates to pursue similar \nbusiness interests involving the distribution and retail sale of consumer electronics \nthere. Plaintiff moved to the city of Al Ain in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, where he sought \nand obtained a residency permit from the UAE in order to conduct business; he invested \nsubstantial financial resources provided by family members in pursuing that course. \nPage 8 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 9 of 20    Page ID#: 9\n31.  In the evening of June 1, 2011, persons unknown to plaintiff (who plaintiff \nlater learned were UAE plainclothes secret police) invaded plaintiff's home in Al Ain, \nseized some of his personal property (computer, phone, etc.), and compelled plaintiff to \naccompany them in a vehicle. Several of plaintiff's friends and neighbors witnessed \nplaintiff's apprehension. Plaintiff was blindfolded, placed in a confined space in the \nvehicle, and the air conditioner in the vehicle was turned on high and directed at him \nwith the effect that he became quite chilled. \n32.  Plaintiff was taken to a then-unknown location approximately two hours’ \ndriving time from Al Ain. Still blindfolded, he was led into a building and into a long hall \nwhere, by peeking down through the bottom of his blindfold, he noticed that he was \npassing door after door. His guards stopped at one door and put him inside a \nwindowless cell where he was lodged. Upon removal of his blindfold, he saw that his \ntiny cell lacked toilet facilities. His cell contained only a bed and some bedding. The cell \nwas very cold because the air conditioning had been set on high.  \n33.  The following morning the interrogations of plaintiff began. Except for the \none instance noted below, during all of his interrogations plaintiff was blindfolded. Once \nblindfolded, he was taken to a room where, throughout his ordeal, plaintiff was \nquestioned for hours in English. Periodically during the 106 days of his imprisonment \nand torture, plaintiff occasionally was able to peek beneath the blindfold and view shoes \nand the lower torsos of his interrogators.  \n34.  The primary focus of the blindfolded interrogations was events as \nPortland's as-Saber Mosque, addressing in particular who plaintiff knew at the mosque \nhad a \"jihadi mentality,\" what topics the mosque's leader, Sheikh Mohamed Kariye, \nPage 9 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 10 of 20    Page ID#: 10\nspeaks about both in public and in private, and how fundraising at the mosque occurs \nand who engages in fundraising there. The interrogators also questioned plaintiff about \ncircumstances and events that plaintiff had disclosed to defendants Noordeloos and \nDundas during his interrogation at the embassy in Khartoum. Numerous times during \nthe blindfolded interrogations plaintiff's interrogators urged him to cooperate with them \nand with the FBI by becoming an informant.  \n35.  When plaintiff was returned to his cell at the end of the first day of \ninterrogation he discovered that his bed and bedding had been removed. The air \nconditioning remained at a high level, which made the cell extremely cold. Because his \nbed and bedding had been removed, plaintiff was obliged to sleep almost naked on the \ncold cement floor.   \n36.  During the initial period of his confinement plaintiff resisted answering \nsome of the questions, insisting that he was an American citizen and needed to speak \nwith his ambassador and with his attorney. In response, plaintiff's jailers struck him on \nhis head and he fell to the ground. Throughout course of his confinement plaintiff was \nrepeatedly beaten severely on his head, back, legs, and feet with batons and plastic \npipes, required to assume stress positions for hours, and threatened with death by \nstrangulation by use of a flexible plastic pipe. One particularly painful torture method his \ninterrogators used was to force plaintiff to lie on his stomach with his sandals off, \nwhereupon he was beaten severely on the soles of his feet; thereafter, he was required \nto stand on his feet, which standing caused him great pain. \n37.  On several occasions plaintiff told his interrogators that the questions he \nwas being asked and the suggestions of cooperation with the FBI were the same \nPage 10 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 11 of 20    Page ID#: 11\nquestions and suggestion he had heard from defendants Noordeloos and Dundas; he \nthus inquired whether his confinement and mistreatment was at the request of the FBI. \nOn each such occasion the interrogators responded by beating plaintiff severely.   \n38.  As noted above, during his interrogations plaintiff was occasionally able to \npeek beneath his blindfold and view the lower torsos of his interrogators. On most \noccasions, based on their clothing and accents, plaintiff believes that his interrogators \nwere Arabs. On other occasions, however, plaintiff was able to view the shoes and \nslacks of several individuals who wore Western dress. Plaintiff believes that in those \ninstances representatives of the United States were present and witnessing the \ninterrogations and that those United States representatives controlled the questions \nbeing posed to plaintiff.  \n39.  On or about June 14, 2011, plaintiff was informed that he had to take a lie \ndetector test. During the test, for the only time during his confinement, plaintiff was \nquestioned without a blindfold in place. The questioning during the test focused not \nupon events at Portland's as-Saber Mosque but, rather, whether plaintiff's financial \narrangements involved soliciting funds for al-Qaeda. Following the lie detector test \nplaintiff’s bed and bedding were returned to his cell.  \n40.  On June 20, 2011, immediately after learning from plaintiff's family that \nplaintiff had been apprehended in the UAE (the family had learned of plaintiff's \napprehension from witnesses who observed the event), the undersigned Oregon \ncounsel telephoned and then e-mailed the United States Consulate in Abu Dhabi to \ninform them that plaintiff, a United States citizen, had gone missing and that witnesses \nin Al Ain had viewed him being placed in a SUV of the type that is commonly used by \nPage 11 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 12 of 20    Page ID#: 12\nthe UAE secret police. The consulate officials indicated that they would look into the \nmatter. Immediately thereafter, at the request of the undersigned Oregon counsel, \nCongressman Earl Blumenauer’s office contacted the State Department on behalf of \nplaintiff. \n41.  The interrogations, including beatings and stress positions, as well as \nbeing subjected to temperature extremes, sleep deprivation, and humiliation when not \nbeing interrogated, continued daily from June 14 through July 27.  \n42.  On July 28, plaintiff was informed that a woman had arrived to see him. \nHe was told that he was to meet with the American consul and that he should not \ndisclose to the consular officer that he had been mistreated during his detention lest he \nbeaten still more severely. \n43.  On July 28, 2011, plaintiff, accompanied by two guards, was taken to a \nmeeting room where he met “Marwa,” an employee of the State Department who, on \ninformation and belief, is of Egyptian extraction. The two guards positioned themselves \nclose to plaintiff, one on each side. Marwa was dressed in Islamic attire (a “hijab,” or \ncovering of her hair). By that time plaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds of body \nweight. \n  44.  The meeting with Marwa was short and superficial. Although by that time \nplaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds, Marwa stated that plaintiff appeared to be in \ngood shape. During the interview plaintiff attempted by facial contortions and winks to \nindicate that he was under duress, but Marwa either did not notice or disregarded these \nsignals. \nPage 12 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 13 of 20    Page ID#: 13\n  45.  Marwa questioned plaintiff regarding what offense he had been charged \nwith, whereupon plaintiff asked the two guards what he had been charged with. The \nguards stated that plaintiff was being held without charge and that the authorities were \nmerely conducting an investigation.  \n  46.  Marwa’s visit was the only United States consular visit during plaintiff's \n106 days of detention and torture. Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff was \nreturned to his cell and the interrogations and torture resumed.  \n  47.  Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff’s interrogators constantly \nstated that he would be released “soon” or “tomorrow.” However, after approximately a \nweek of continuing interrogation and torture plaintiff became despondent. He believed \nthat the United States had “thrown [him] away,” primarily because of his black skin. He \nconsequently began to consider refusing food in an attempt at suicide, but was told that \nhe would be force-fed if necessary. \n  48.  Toward the end of his interrogation plaintiff again inquired of his \ninterrogator whether the FBI had requested that he be detained and interrogated. This \ntime, instead of being beaten, the interrogator stated that indeed the FBI had made \nsuch a request and that the American and Emerati authorities work closely on a number \nof such matters. \n  49.  On September 14, 2011, plaintiff was told that he would be released that \nday. His belongings were returned to him and money from his wallet was taken to buy \nhim a plane ticket back to the United States. However, when the authorities attempted \nto purchase his ticket they were told that the United States would not allow him to return \nby airplane because he was on the No-Fly List. Plaintiff was not given the option of \nPage 13 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 14 of 20    Page ID#: 14\nreturning to the United States by other means. Therefore plaintiff chose to be sent by air \nto Sweden, where he had a relative. \n  50.  Plaintiff arrived in Sweden traumatized, with few financial and other \nresources, and clothing entirely inappropriate for the Scandinavian weather and climate. \n  51.  In addition to being stranded with few resources in a foreign country, being \nplaced on the No-Fly List resulted in plaintiff's losing virtually all of his rights as a citizen \nof the United States - he could not return home to enjoy the rights, privileges and \nimmunities of citizenship. Moreover, his experience with State Department officials in \nKhartoum and Abu Dhabi demonstrated to him that he could not count on the State \nDepartment to protect or even to assist him while overseas. \n  52.   American passport holders are allowed to visit other countries for only \nlimited periods of time before they have to leave the country they are visiting; in the \ncase of Sweden and other Schengen countries the maximum stay is for 90 days unless \nspecial arrangements are made, such as requesting asylum. \n  53.  Upon arriving in Sweden and being unable to return home, plaintiff \ncontacted a Swedish attorney, Advokat Hans Bredberg, who suggested that plaintiff \nseek political asylum in that country. Believing that the FBI was responsible for his \ndetention and torture in Abu Dhabi and that he may still be in danger of abuse in \ncountries that condone torture (including the United States), plaintiff submitted an \napplication for asylum to the authorities in Sweden. Plaintiff understands that Swedish \nauthorities have determined that he is not a supporter of terrorism, and that his \napplication for political asylum is pending. \nPage 14 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 15 of 20    Page ID#: 15\n  54.  On April 18, 2012, a press conference was held in Sweden during which \nplaintiff's ordeal was disclosed publicly. Less than two weeks later, on May 1, 2012, \nplaintiff was indicted in the Southern District of California for \"conspiracy to structure\" \n2010 monetary transfers from his family to him in the UAE that plaintiff used to attempt \nto start his business. On information and belief, this indictment was in retaliation for \nplaintiff's publicizing of his ordeal.    \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim for Relief: Denial of Citizenship - Right to Return to Homeland   \n  55.  By placing plaintiff on the No-Fly List and prohibiting plaintiff from returning \nhome after his ordeal in the UAE, defendants effectively stripped plaintiff of his rights, \nprivileges, and immunities as a citizen, thereby effectively rendering him stateless in \nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n  56.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and Dundas which deprived plaintiff of his rights as a citizen \ngive rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth Amendment pursuant \nto Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971).  Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $10 million. \nSecond Claim for Relief: Torture \n  57.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54.   \n  58.  Defendants, including defendants Noordeloos and Dundas, enlisted \nforeign intermediaries to torture plaintiff at their behest. The foreign intermediaries were \ndirected to torture plaintiff, and plaintiff was tortured in accordance with defendants' \ninstructions.    \nPage 15 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 16 of 20    Page ID#: 16\n  59.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and Dundas which deprived plaintiff of his rights as a citizen, \nincluding the right to be free from torture, give rise to a cause of action for damages \ndirectly under the Fifth Amendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents \nof Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Plaintiff has been damaged in the \namount of $10 million. \nThird Claim for Relief: Denial of Counsel \n  60.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54. \n  61.  Defendants Noordeloos and Dundas refused plaintiff's demand to be \nrepresented by counsel in Khartoum, Sudan, on April 22, 2010. Instead, those \ndefendants continued to interrogate plaintiff notwithstanding such demand and then \nturned over such information to United States law enforcement defendants, which used \ninformation gleaned from plaintiff in securing his indictment which is now pending before \nthe District Court for the Southern District of California. \n  62.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and Dundas which deprived plaintiff of his rights as a citizen, \ngive rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth Amendment pursuant \nto Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971).  \nFourth Claim for Relief: Violation of Right Against Self-Incrimination \n  63.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54. \n  64.  By continuing the April 22, 2010, interrogation of plaintiff after a demand \nthat he be represented by counsel and inquiring into matters related to the pending \nPage 16 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 17 of 20    Page ID#: 17\nindictment of plaintiff in the Southern District of California, Defendants Noordeloos and \nDundas violated plaintiff's right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to \nthe Untied States Constitution.  \n  65.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and Dundas which deprived plaintiff of his right against self-\nincrimination give rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth \nAmendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).  \nFifth Claim for Relief: Substantive Due Process - Right to Return to Homeland \n  66.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54.  \n  67.  Defendants Holder, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mueller, FBI Terrorist \nScreening Center, and Healy’s actions in placing plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, secret \nNo-Fly List resulted in the violation of plaintiff's Fifth Amendment substantive due \nprocess right to return to his homeland once abroad. \nSixth Claim for Relief: Due Process - The No-Fly List \n  68.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54.  \n  69.  Defendants Holder, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mueller, FBI Terrorist \nScreening Center, and Healy’s actions in placing plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, secret \nNo-Fly List without informing him of such placement, the basis for his inclusion on the \nNo-Fly List, the means of removing his name from the No-Fly List, or providing an \nindependent forum in which plaintiff might secure the removal of his name from the No-\nFly List, all violated plaintiff’s right to procedural due process under the Fifth \nAmendment. \nPage 17 - COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 1    Filed 05/30/13    Page 18 of 20    Page ID#: 18\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:  \n  1.

Defendant Noordeloos and Dundas' denial of plaintiff's right to \ncounsel in the April 22, 2010, interrogation at the United States Embassy is a \nviolation of plaintiff's rights under the Fifth Amendment; \n  d.  Defendants' use of plaintiff's coerced testimony gathered during the \nApril 22, 2010, interrogation at the United States Embassy in Khartoum and \nduring his imprisonment, interrogation, and torture in the UAE is a violation of \nplaintiff's rights under the Fifth Amendment;  \n  e.   Defendants' placing name on the No-Fly List, which prevented him \nfrom returning to his homeland once abroad, is a denial of plaintiff's substantive \ndue process rights under the Fifth Amendment. \n  f.

INTRODUCTION \n1.

This is a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief, and for damages, \nbased upon defendants’ violation of plaintiff’s constitutional, statutory, and common law \nPage 6 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 7 of 46\nrights. The claims asserted arise under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n(substantive and procedural), the Fifth Amendment’s right to counsel and prohibition \nagainst self-incrimination, the First Amendment’s right to freedom of association, the \nFourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, 50 \nU.S.C. § 1810, 18 U.S.C. § 2707(a), 18 U.S.C. § 2712, 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a), the Torture \nVictim Protection Act, and the common law.  \n20.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n5 U.S.C. § 702, 18 U.S.C. § 2712, 28 U.S.C. § 1367, and Bivens v.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nGeneral Factual Allegations \n23.  Air travel is the only practical means of passenger transportation between \nthe North American continent and Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. \n24.  Defendant FBI is responsible for selecting individuals for inclusion on, and \nPage 7 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 8 of 46\nmaintaining, the \"No-Fly List,\" which lists individuals whom the airlines flying within, into, \nor over the United States may not transport. \n25.  Information upon which a determination is made to place an individual on \nthe No-Fly List is kept secret, and individuals on the No-Fly List are not informed when \ntheir names are placed on the List, when their names are removed from the No-Fly List, \nor what their current status is vis-à-vis the No-Fly List.  \n26.  The criterion for placing an individual's name on the No-Fly List was \ndeveloped in secret by the Terrorism Screening Center without congressional oversight \nor approval. Under the present criterion, a person may be \"nominated\" to be on the List \nif \"there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is a known or suspected \nterrorist.\"  \n27.  Most individuals on the No-Fly List, and plaintiff in this action, are \nprohibited from flying on commercial aircraft into, out of, or over United States and \nCanadian airspace.  \nPlaintiff's Background, Travel, Imprisonment, Torture, and Release  \n28.  Plaintiff is a naturalized American citizen of Eritrean descent. When he \nwas a small boy, war broke out in Eritrea, and thus his family took him to Sudan, where \nhe was when the State of Eritrea came into being in 1993. From Sudan the Fikre family \nemigrated to the United States. \n29.  Beginning in 2006, plaintiff resided in Portland, Oregon. In late December \n2009, after working for an American cell phone company, plaintiff decided to attempt to \ndistribute and to sell consumer electronic products on the retail market in East Africa. \nHe began by returning to Sudan, where some of his extended family still reside. Upon \nPage 8 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 9 of 46\narrival in Sudan, plaintiff, in compliance with a recommendation by the State \nDepartment, contacted the United States Consulate in Khartoum and informed a \nrepresentative of the consulate of his interest in pursuing business opportunities in the \ncountry. The representative encouraged plaintiff to pursue business opportunities in \nSudan. In reliance upon the representative's recommendation plaintiff began the \nprocess of obtaining a Sudanese business license. \n30.  On Tuesday, April 20, 2010, defendant Noordeloos sent an email to \nplaintiff, which stated: \"Younas, I work at the embassy in Khartoum and need to meet up \nwith you on wed 4/21. Can you email me back and let me know what time in the \nafternoon works for you? Best, David Noordeloos US Department of State\".  \n31.  On Wednesday, April 21, defendant Noordeloos sent an email to plaintiff, \nwhich stated: \"Yonas, I hope this finds you well. I still need to meet with you as soon as \npossible, can you give me a call and let me know what time works for you to meet? You \ncan email me back or try me at the Embassy or on my cell, but please contact me \nsoonest. Regards, David Noordeloos, US Department of State\" [telephone numbers \nredacted]. \n32.  On April 21, at approximately 9 p.m. local time, plaintiff called the number \ngiven and spoke with defendant Noordeloos. Defendant Noordeloos stated that a \nnumber of Americans in Sudan had been invited to the Embassy for a luncheon the \nfollowing day in order to discuss how Americans might stay safe during a period of \npolitical turmoil in Sudan. Plaintiff agreed to attend the luncheon on that basis, which \nturned out to be a false pretense. \n33.  The next day plaintiff appeared at the embassy. After going through \nPage 9 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 10 of 46\nsecurity screening, plaintiff met defendant Noordeloos and another person, defendant \nJohn Doe I, who identified himself as Jason Dundas. Defendants Noordeloos and John \nDoe I (Jason Dundas) escorted plaintiff to a small meeting room and shut the door; \ndefendants positioning themselves between plaintiff and the door. At that point \ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) produced badges and stated \nthat they were FBI agents assigned to the Portland office.  \n34.  Upon being informed that defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason \nDundas) were FBI agents from the Portland office, plaintiff stated that he wanted to be \nrepresented by his legal counsel (plaintiff was then represented by Oregon attorney \nBrandon Mayfield) during the interrogation. Defendant Noordeloos denied Mr. Fikre’s \nrequest for such representation on the grounds that plaintiff had been placed on the No-\nFly List and thus could not return to the United States to confer with his attorney.  \n35.  Because defendants John Doe I (Jason Dundas) and Noordeloos were \nblocking the door, plaintiff, who had never before been detained or arrested, felt he \ncould not leave. During the following interrogation, defendants Noordeloos and John \nDoe I (Jason Dundas) questioned plaintiff extensively about the events, activities, and \nleadership at the as-Saber Mosque in Portland, which plaintiff had attended for prayer \nservices. Defendant Noordeloos also questioned plaintiff about the source of his \nfinancial support for this business endeavors in Sudan, and told plaintiff that, because of \nthe Sudan sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, it was illegal for \nplaintiff to engage in business transactions in Sudan - a statement that is inconsistent \nwith the advice and recommendation earlier given by the representative of the embassy \nas set forth in ¶ 29, supra.  \nPage 10 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 11 of 46\n36.  Defendant Noordeloos next told plaintiff that the FBI desired plaintiff to \nbecome an FBI informant to work upon “a case” that was then developing. Defendant \nNoordeloos stated that, in return, plaintiff would be paid substantial compensation, be in \na position to enjoy “the good life,” and that the FBI would take steps to remove plaintiff \nfrom the No-Fly List. Defendant Noordeloos then asked, \"Don't you love your wife?\", \nwhich question plaintiff considered an implicit threat. Plaintiff responded that he did not \nwish to become an FBI informant. The interview lasted for several hours until the close \nof the business day. As the day wore on, defendant Noordeloos suggested that they \nresume the discussion on the following day; in order to escape the interrogation room \nand leave the embassy, plaintiff agreed. \n37.  At approximately 8:45 a.m. on the following morning, plaintiff called \ndefendant Noordeloos and stated that he did not wish to meet further with the FBI \nagents because he would be wasting their and his time; he reiterated that he did not \nwish to become an informant for the FBI. Defendant Noordeloos became agitated and, \nto the best of plaintiff's recollection, stated, \"Wait a minute! Are you trying to tell me you \ndon't want to work with us!\" Defendant Noordeloos then stated, \"Whenever you want to \ngo home you come to the embassy.\" Plaintiff understood this to mean that plaintiff's \nname would not be removed from the No-Fly List and he could not travel to the United \nStates unless he became an informant/agent provocateur for the FBI. \n38.  On May 4, 2010, defendant Noordeloos wrote an email to plaintiff which \nstated: \"Yonas, Thanks for meeting with us last week in Sudan. While we hope to get \nyour side of issues we keep hearing about, the choice is yours to make. The time to \nhelp yourself is now. Be safe in Sudan, Dave Noordeloos.\" \nPage 11 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 12 of 46\n39.  Plaintiff remained in Khartoum for almost two months following his \nmeeting with defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas). During that time \nhe noticed that he was being followed by persons he assumed were affiliated with the \nSudanese secret police, and he was told by merchants and other acquaintances in his \nneighborhood that similar individuals had been inquiring about him and his activities. \n40.  On or about June 15, 2010, plaintiff left Sudan, and on or about \nSeptember 15, 2010, plaintiff arrived in the UAE to pursue similar business interests \ninvolving the distribution and retail sale of consumer electronics there. Plaintiff moved to \nthe city of Al Ain in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, where he sought and obtained a residency \npermit from the UAE in order to conduct business; he invested substantial financial \nresources provided by family members in pursuing that course. \n41.  In the evening of June 1, 2011, persons unknown to plaintiff (who plaintiff \nlater learned were UAE plainclothes secret police) invaded plaintiff's home in Al Ain, \nseized plaintiff's computer, phone, and other items, and compelled plaintiff to \naccompany them in a vehicle. Several of plaintiff's friends and neighbors witnessed \nplaintiff's apprehension. Plaintiff was blindfolded, placed in a confined space in the \nvehicle, and the air conditioner in the vehicle was turned on high and directed at him \nwith the effect that he became quite chilled. \n42.  Plaintiff was taken to a then-unknown location approximately two hours’ \ndriving time from Al Ain. Still blindfolded, he was led into a building and into a long hall \nwhere, by peeking down through the bottom of his blindfold, he noticed that he was \npassing door after door. His guards stopped at one door and put him inside a \nwindowless cell where he was lodged. Upon removal of his blindfold, he saw that his \nPage 12 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 13 of 46\ntiny cell lacked toilet facilities. His cell contained only a bed and some bedding. The cell \nwas very cold because the air conditioning had been set on high.  \n43.  The following morning the interrogations of plaintiff began. Except for the \none instance noted below, during all of his interrogations plaintiff was blindfolded. Once \nblindfolded, he was taken to a room where, throughout his ordeal, plaintiff was \nquestioned for hours in English. Periodically during the 106 days of his imprisonment \nand torture, plaintiff occasionally was able to peek beneath the blindfold and view shoes \nand the lower torsos of his interrogators.  \n44.  The primary focus of the blindfolded interrogations was events at \nPortland's as-Saber Mosque, addressing in particular who plaintiff knew at the mosque \nwho had a \"jihadi mentality,\" what topics the mosque's leader, Sheikh Mohamed Kariye, \nspeaks about both in public and in private, and how fundraising at the mosque occurs \nand who engages in fundraising there. The interrogators also questioned plaintiff about \ncircumstances and events that plaintiff had disclosed to defendants Noordeloos and \nJohn Doe I (Jason Dundas) during his interrogation at the embassy in Khartoum. \nNumerous times during the blindfolded interrogations plaintiff's interrogators urged him \nto cooperate with them and with the FBI by becoming an informant.  \n45.  When plaintiff was returned to his cell at the end of the first day of \ninterrogation he discovered that his bed and bedding had been removed. The air \nconditioning remained at a high level, which made the cell extremely cold. Because his \nbed and bedding had been removed, plaintiff was obliged to sleep almost naked on the \ncold cement floor.   \n46.  During the initial period of his confinement plaintiff resisted answering \nPage 13 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 14 of 46\nsome of the questions, insisting that he was an American citizen and needed to speak \nwith his ambassador and with his attorney. In response, plaintiff's jailers struck him on \nhis head and he fell to the ground. Throughout course of his confinement plaintiff was \nrepeatedly beaten severely on his head, back, legs, and feet with batons and plastic \npipes, required to assume stress positions for hours, and threatened with death by \nstrangulation by use of a flexible plastic pipe. One particularly painful torture method his \ninterrogators used was to force plaintiff to lie on his stomach with his sandals off, \nwhereupon he was beaten severely on the soles of his feet; thereafter, he was required \nto stand on his feet, which standing caused him great pain. \n47.  On several occasions plaintiff told his interrogators that the questions he \nwas being asked and the suggestions of cooperation with the FBI were the same \nquestions and suggestion he had heard from defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I \n(Jason Dundas); he thus inquired whether his confinement and mistreatment was at the \nrequest of the FBI. On each such occasion the interrogators responded by beating \nplaintiff severely.   \n48.  As noted above, during his interrogations plaintiff was occasionally able to \npeek beneath his blindfold and view the lower torsos of his interrogators. On most \noccasions, based on their clothing and accents, plaintiff believes that his interrogators \nwere Arabs. On other occasions, however, plaintiff was able to view the shoes and \nslacks of several individuals who wore Western dress. Plaintiff believes that in those \ninstances some or all of the Individual defendants, acting as representatives of the \nUnited States, were present and witnessed the interrogations and that those Individual \ndefendants participated in interrogating plaintiff.  \nPage 14 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 15 of 46\n49.  All Individual defendants who attended and participated in the \ninterrogation of plaintiff were present with the permission, and were under the physical \nand legal control, of UAE authorities who operated and maintained the secret prison. \n50.  On or about June 14, 2011, plaintiff was informed that he had to take a lie \ndetector test. During the test, for the only time during his confinement, plaintiff was \nquestioned without a blindfold in place. The questioning during the test focused not \nupon events at Portland's as-Saber Mosque but, rather, upon whether plaintiff's financial \narrangements involved soliciting funds for al-Qaeda. Following the lie detector test \nplaintiff’s bed and bedding were returned to his cell.  \n51.  The interrogations, including beatings and stress positions, as well as \nbeing subjected to temperature extremes, sleep deprivation, and humiliation when not \nbeing interrogated, continued daily from June 14 through July 27.  \n52.  On June 20, 2011, immediately after learning from plaintiff's family that \nplaintiff had been apprehended in the UAE (the family had learned of plaintiff's \napprehension from witnesses who observed the event), Oregon counsel Thomas \nNelson telephoned and then e-mailed the United States Consulate in Abu Dhabi to \ninform them that plaintiff, a United States citizen, had gone missing and that witnesses \nin Al Ain had viewed him being placed in a SUV of the type that is commonly used by \nthe UAE secret police. The consulate officials indicated that they would look into the \nmatter.  \n53.  On July 21, 2011, plaintiff's Oregon counsel Thomas Nelson on behalf of \nplaintiff contacted Representative Earl Blumenauer's office to request assistance in \nlocating plaintiff and made contact with staff member Emily Barrett. Ms. Barrett stated \nPage 15 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 16 of 46\nthat Congressman Blumenauer would look into the situation. \n54.  On July 28, 2011, plaintiff was informed that a woman from the American \nconsulate had arrived to see him. He was told that he was to meet with the American \nconsul and that he should not disclose to the consular officer that he had been \nmistreated during his detention lest he beaten still more severely. \n55.  On July 28, 2011, plaintiff, accompanied by two guards, was taken to a \nmeeting room where he met “Marwa,” a consular employee of the State Department \nwho, on information and belief, is of Egyptian extraction. The two guards positioned \nthemselves close to plaintiff, one on each side. Marwa was dressed in Islamic attire (a \n“hijab,” or covering of her hair). By that time plaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds \nof body weight. \n56.  The meeting with Marwa was short and superficial. Although by that time \nplaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds, Marwa stated that plaintiff appeared to be in \ngood shape. During the interview plaintiff attempted by facial contortions and winks to \nindicate that he was under duress, but Marwa either did not notice or disregarded these \nsignals. \n57.  Marwa questioned plaintiff regarding what offense he had been charged \nwith, whereupon plaintiff asked the two guards what he had been charged with. The \nguards stated that plaintiff was being held without charge and that the authorities were \nmerely conducting an investigation.  \n58.  Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff was returned to his cell and the \ninterrogations and torture resumed. Marwa’s visit was the only United States consular \nvisit during plaintiff's 106 days of detention and torture; the consulate did not visit or \nPage 16 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 17 of 46\nmake any contact with plaintiff during his remaining 49 days of his confinement and \ntorture, nor did it provide any assistance to plaintiff when he was deported from the \nUAE. \n59.  Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff became despondent. Because \nthe consul's office had sent a Muslim woman wearing a hijab to interact with the prison \nauthorities and the two guards, plaintiff came to believe that, because of his black skin, \nthe United States had “thrown [him] away.” He consequently began to consider refusing \nfood in an attempt at suicide, but was told that he would be force-fed if necessary. \n60.  Toward the end of his interrogation plaintiff again inquired of his \ninterrogator whether the FBI had requested that he be detained and interrogated. This \ntime, instead of being beaten, the interrogator stated that indeed the FBI had made \nsuch a request and that the American and Emerati authorities work closely on a number \nof such matters. \n61.  On September 14, 2011, plaintiff was told that he would be released that \nday but would have to leave the UAE and stay out for at least a year. His belongings \nwere returned to him and money from his wallet was taken to buy him a plane ticket \nback to the United States while plaintiff remained in custody. Such a ticket was \npurchased from a travel agency; however, when the jailer took the ticket to the airport to \nobtain a boarding pass, the boarding pass was refused on the grounds that plaintiff was \non the No-Fly List. \n62.  Plaintiff's custodian was visibly upset because he could not board the flight \nout of the UAE, and asked plaintiff, “What kind of country would refuse a citizen’s return \nto his own country?” or words to that effect. The custodian then reiterated that plaintiff \nPage 17 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 18 of 46\ncould not stay in the UAE, and therefore would have to go somewhere else, and asked \nwhere plaintiff wished to be sent. Because plaintiff had a relative in Sweden, plaintiff \nindicated that he should be sent there. Therefore, the custodian took more money from \nplaintiff's wallet and arranged the purchase of a ticket to Stockholm, Sweden. This time \na boarding pass was issued for plaintiff. \n63.  The United States consulate in the UAE knew or should have known that \nplaintiff would be deported upon his release from prison, but the consulate took no \naction to provide assistance to plaintiff upon his release. \n64.  Plaintiff arrived in Sweden traumatized, with few financial and other \nresources, and clothing entirely inappropriate for the Scandinavian weather and climate. \n65.  Shortly after arriving in Stockholm plaintiff contacted the airline that had \nrefused to issue him a boarding pass in the UAE and discussed his situation with them. \nThe representative he spoke with confirmed that he had been denied boarding on the \nflight from the UAE to the United States but stated that she could not provide any \nreasons for such refusal. Plaintiff then requested a refund of the ticket price, but the \nrepresentative stated that because the ticket had been purchased through a travel \nagency in the UAE he would have to get the refund (if any) from that travel agency. \n66.  To date plaintiff has been unable to obtain a refund for the unused ticket \nfrom the UAE to the United States.  \n67.  In addition to being stranded with few resources in a foreign country, being \nplaced on the No-Fly List resulted in plaintiff's losing virtually all of his rights as a citizen \nof the United States - he could not return home to enjoy the rights, privileges and \nimmunities of citizenship. Moreover, his experience with State Department officials in \nPage 18 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 19 of 46\nKhartoum and Abu Dhabi demonstrated to him that the State Department would neither \nprotect nor assist him while overseas; rather, it would actively work to his detriment. \n68.  Nationals of one country are allowed to visit foreign countries for only \nlimited periods of time before they have to leave the country they are visiting; in the \ncase of Sweden and other Schengen Agreement countries the maximum stay is for 90 \ndays for holders of United States passports unless special arrangements are made, \nsuch as requesting asylum. \n69.  Upon arriving in Sweden and being unable to return home, plaintiff \ncontacted a Swedish attorney, Advokat Hans Bredberg, who suggested that plaintiff \nseek protective asylum in that country. Believing that the United States, through the FBI, \nwas responsible for his detention and torture in Abu Dhabi and that he may still be in \ndanger of abuse in countries that condone torture (including the United States), plaintiff \nsubmitted an application for asylum to the authorities in Sweden. \n70.  On April 18, 2012, a press conference was held in Advokat Bredberg's \noffice in Stockholm during which plaintiff's ordeal was disclosed publicly. Less than two \nweeks later, on May 1, 2012, plaintiff and two other individuals were indicted in the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of California, Docket No. 3:12-cr-\n06189-JAH, for \"conspiracy to structure\" monetary transfers from his family to him in the \nUAE between April 14, 2010, and April 19, 2010, which funds plaintiff used to attempt to \nstart his business. On information and belief, this indictment was in retaliation for \nplaintiff's publicizing of his ordeal through the April 18, 2012 press conference in \nStockholm, and based at least in part upon information the United States obtained from \nthe interview at the United States Embassy in Khartoum, from plaintiff's 106 days of \nPage 19 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 20 of 46\ninterrogation and torture in the UAE, and from the electronic surveillance of plaintiff.  \n71.  Sometime in the fall of 2013 counsel for defendants contacted counsel for \nplaintiff and suggested that if plaintiff wished to return to the United States he should \nvisit the United States embassy in Stockholm to make necessary arrangements. After \nconferring with plaintiff in Stockholm, plaintiff's representatives informed defendants' \ncounsel that plaintiff was apprehensive about entering the embassy grounds and that \nplaintiff would, under the present circumstances, consider returning if the United States \n(1) guaranteed plaintiff's safety from extra-judicial actions, and (2) provided adequate \nassurances that plaintiff could leave the United States once he returned. Counsel for \ndefendants indicated that the United States would not provide such guarantees and \nassurances. \n72.  In early November 2013 plaintiff filed with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) a Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (“TRIP”) request and was \nassigned a redress number. By letter dated January 23, 2014, DHS informed plaintiff \nthat \"It has been determined that no changes or corrections are warranted at this time\" \nand suggesting that plaintiff might wish to take an administrative appeal from this \ndecision. Because it was unclear from the DHS letter whether plaintiff was then on the \nNo-Fly List, and thus it was unclear whether plaintiff was aggrieved by this decision, by \nletter dated February 24, 2014, plaintiff requested clarification and a stay pending \nresolution of this issue and the resolution of the current litigation. By letter dated March \n11, 2014, DHS replied that an extension to take an appeal would be granted to April 22, \n2014. Plaintiff then abandoned his efforts with DHS.  \n73.  Because of the separation occasioned by plaintiff's inability to return to the \nPage 20 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 21 of 46\nUnited States and because of the stigma attaching to plaintiff occasioned by the United \nStates' putting him on the No-Fly List, plaintiff's wife sought and received a divorce from \nplaintiff.  \n74.  Early in 2015 plaintiff's application for asylum in Sweden was denied.  \n75.  On February 12, 2015, the DHS by letter informed plaintiff that DHS had \non its own motion \"reevaluated\" plaintiff's prior TRIP inquiry and informed plaintiff that \nhe was on the No-Fly List because he had been \"identified as an individual who 'may be \na threat to civil aviation or national security.'\" The DHS provided no factual bases to \nsupport this conclusion, and requested plaintiff's response. By a letter dated February \n19, 2015, plaintiff categorically denied that he was or is a threat and stated that the bare \nconclusion contained in the DHS latter of February 12, 2015, prevented plaintiff from \nproviding a meaningful response; consequently, plaintiff asserted that the February 12, \n2015, letter violated plaintiff's due process rights. By a \"Decision and Order\" dated \nMarch 9, 2015, the DHS indicated that plaintiff's name would remain on the No-Fly List. \n76.  On February 14, 2015, the Swedish government transported plaintiff to \nPortland, Oregon, by private jet.  \nPlaintiff's Surveillance, Indictment, and Dismissal \n77.  In 2010, while he was inside the United States, plaintiff and his brother \nDawit Woldehawariat - both US citizens - worked together to set up a lawful business \nventure abroad. In furtherance of this objective, plaintiff and his brother discussed the \nparameters of the business venture they envisioned and the financial resources \nnecessary to execute their plan.  These discussions occurred by telephone, email, and \ntext message. \nPage 21 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 22 of 46\n78.  Unbeknownst at the time to either plaintiff or his brother, defendants were \nintercepting and/or acquiring the content of plaintiff’s telephone calls, his text messages, \nand his emails. Plaintiff now knows this because the United States has confirmed, \nthrough Department of Justice filings submitted in a since-dismissed prosecution \nagainst plaintiff in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, \nthat it intercepted the contents of plaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text messages. \nSee U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Docket No. 3:12-cr-06189-\nJAH, Doc. # 10. \n79.  These interceptions and/or acquisitions of plaintiff’s telephone calls, \nemails, and text messages were not conducted pursuant to a warrant and were not \nsupported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion. \n80.  On information and belief, the information upon which defendants caused \nplaintiff to meet with defendant FBI agents Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) \nin Khartoum and upon which defendants caused the UAE to imprison and torture \nplaintiff was derived from illegal surveillance and searches.  \n81.  On information and belief, information derived from the electronic \nsurveillance of plaintiff was willfully, knowingly, and/or recklessly disseminated for the \nunlawful purpose of interrogating plaintiff without counsel and coercing plaintiff to \nbecome an informant and then to cause his torture by proxy in the UAE. \n82.  On information and belief, the information derived from the electronic \nsurveillance of plaintiff was disseminated to several agencies and foreign governments \nincluding but not limited to the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security \nCouncil, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the \nPage 22 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 23 of 46\nDepartment of Justice/Federal Bureau of Investigation, the US Attorney’s Office for the \nDistrict of Oregon, the Department of the Treasury and the National Security Agency, \nand the United Arab Emirates. \n83.  More than six months before the filing of the additional claims set forth in \nplaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, plaintiff filed a federal tort claim notice with the \nDepartment of Justice, NSA, FBI, and other agencies for violating the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, the Wiretap Act, and the Stored Communications Act, and \nrelated claims. The named agencies have failed to make a final disposition of the claims \nat this time, and therefore plaintiff deems such failure to be a denial thereof. \n84.  Plaintiff has suffered mistreatment at the hands of defendants including, \nbut not limited to, being placed on the No-Fly List without notice of the factual bases \ntherefor or the opportunity to be heard, denial of legal counsel, false arrest and false \nimprisonment, assault and battery, torture, violation of his right to freedom of \nassociation, illegal surveillance, violation of his right to privacy, and violation of his \nsubstantive and procedural due process rights. Plaintiff intends to continue to attempt to \nexercise his rights, including the right to legal counsel, to travel by air, to be free from \nfalse arrest and false imprisonment, assault and battery, and torture, to freedom of \nassociation, and his substantive and procedural due process rights, but based upon \ndefendants' past misconduct plaintiff has a reasonable fear of further future \nmistreatment by defendants and other agents of the United States. \nClaim One \nFifth Amendment Substantive Due Process - Right to International Travel \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n85.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84.  \nPage 23 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 24 of 46\n86.  Plaintiff has a liberty right to international travel under the Fifth \nAmendment. By placing plaintiff's name on the No-Fly List, defendants have violated \nand are continuing to violate this right, preventing plaintiff from departing, flying over, or \nreturning to the United States, all in violation of plaintiff's Fifth Amendment substantive \ndue process right to travel internationally.  \n87.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \n \nClaim Two  \nFifth Amendment – Violation of Right to Counsel and Right Against Self-\nIncrimination  \nDamages  \n(Against Defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas)) \n88.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84. \n89.  Defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) refused plaintiff's \ndemand to be represented by counsel in Khartoum, Sudan, on April 22, 2010. Instead, \nthose defendants continued to interrogate plaintiff notwithstanding such demand and \nthen turned over such information to United States law enforcement defendants, which \nused information gleaned from plaintiff in securing his indictment in the District Court for \nthe Southern District of California. \n90.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I (Jason Dundas) which deprived plaintiff of his \nright to counsel give rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth \nAmendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \nPage 24 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 25 of 46\n \nClaim Three \nFifth Amendment Procedural Due Process -  \nPlacement and Retention on the No-Fly List \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n91.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84.  \n92.  Plaintiff has a protected liberty interest in international travel.  Plaintiff also \nhas a protected liberty interest in his reputation and in freedom from government-\nassigned stigmas that restrict or prevent him from engaging in activities in which he \ncould otherwise engage and in which others not stigmatized are free to engage. \n93.  Defendants‘ actions in placing and keeping plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, \nsecret No-Fly List substantially interferes with and deprives plaintiff of his liberty interest \nin international travel.  Defendants‘ actions in placing and keeping plaintiff on the FBI-\nmaintained, secret No-Fly List also injures plaintiff’s liberty interest in his reputation by, \nfirst, stigmatizing him as a known or suspected terrorist and as an individual who \nrepresents a threat of engaging in or conducting a violent act of terrorism and who is \noperationally capable of doing so and, second, on the basis of that stigma, depriving \nhim of the ability to travel by air domestically and internationally as others are permitted \nto do and as plaintiff would be permitted to do absent the stigma.  \n94.  Defendants‘ actions in placing and keeping plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, \nsecret No-Fly List without informing him of such placement, of the basis for his inclusion \non the No-Fly List, of the means of removing his name from the No-Fly List, and without \nproviding an independent forum in which plaintiff might secure the removal of his name \nfrom the No-Fly List, all violated and are continuing to violate plaintiff’s right to \nprocedural due process under the Fifth Amendment.  Such procedures as do exist for \nchallenging inclusion on the No-Fly List are inadequate to satisfy the notice and hearing \nPage 25 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 26 of 46\nrequirements of procedural due process. \n95.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \n \nClaim Four \nFirst Amendment - Violation of Right to Freedom of Association \nInjunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n(Against All Defendants) \n96.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84.  \n97.  It is a policy, custom, and practice of defendants to place individuals on \nthe No-Fly List in order to coerce them into becoming informants/agents provocateur for \nthe FBI. Plaintiff has a right under the First Amendment to associate, and not to \nassociate, with whom he pleases. Defendants placed plaintiff on the No-Fly List in order \nboth to coerce plaintiff into associating with the FBI, and to coerce plaintiff into harming \nhis associations with others with whom he associates, by becoming an informant/agent \nprovocateur in a case then under investigation in Portland. Moreover, when plaintiff \ndeclined to become an informant and agent provocateur, defendants maintained \nplaintiff's name on the No-Fly List in retaliation, which ultimately led to plaintiff's being \nforced to seek protection and asylum in Sweden, all in violation of plaintiff's First \nAmendment right of freedom of association.  \n98.  By these actions, defendants are irreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has \nno adequate remedy at law for defendants’ continuing unlawful conduct, and defendants \nwill continue to violate plaintiff’s legal rights unless enjoined and restrained by this \nCourt. \nPage 26 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 27 of 46\n \nClaim Five \nFifth Amendment - False Arrest and Imprisonment \nDamages \n(Against Defendants Noordeloos, John Doe I (Jason Dundas), and John/Jane \nDoes II-X) \n99.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84.   \n100.  Plaintiff has a Fifth Amendment right to be free from false arrest and \nimprisonment.  On information and belief, some or all of individual defendants \nNoordeloos, John Doe I (Jason Dundas), and John/Jane Does II-X enlisted foreign \nintermediaries to cause the arrest of plaintiff by UAE secret police without probable \ncause that he had committed a crime. The foreign intermediaries did so arrest plaintiff \nand imprisoned him without charge for 106 days, from June 1, 2011, through \nSeptember 15, 2011.   \n101.  On information and belief, some or all of individual defendants \nNoordeloos, John Doe I (Jason Dundas), and John/Jane Does II-X have directly \nperformed or aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, encouraged, \npromoted, instigated, advised, willfully caused, participated in, enabled, contributed to, \nfacilitated, directed, controlled, assisted in, acted in concert with, or conspired in the \ncommission of the above-described acts of false arrest and imprisonment. \n102.

The Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in \ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \nsupported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, \nand the persons or things to be seized.” \nPage 34 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 35 of 46\n131.  Plaintiff’s telephone communications, emails, text messages, and other \ncommunications are protected from interception, search, and seizure by the Fourth \nAmendment. Plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephone \ncommunications, emails, text messages, and other communications. \n132.  Plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by defendants’ \ninterception, search, and seizure of plaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text \nmessages.  Defendants’ actions were not authorized by a warrant satisfying the Fourth \nAmendment, were not supported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and were \nunreasonable. \n133.  Provisions of the Patriot Act and FISA authorize defendants to acquire the \nconstitutionally protected communications of U.S. citizens and residents (i) without \nidentifying the people to be surveilled, (ii) without specifying the facilities, places, \npremises, or property to be monitored, (iii) without observing meaningful limitations on \nthe retention, analysis, and dissemination of acquired information, (iv) without obtaining \nindividualized warrants based on criminal or foreign intelligence probable cause, and (v) \nwithout making prior administrative determinations that the targets of surveillance are \nforeign agents or connected in any way, however tenuously, to terrorism. \n134.  On information and belief, the actions, orders, authorizations, and other \nconduct of defendants Noordeloos, John Doe I (Jason Dundas), and John/Jane Does \nXI-XX deprived plaintiff of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unconstitutional \nsearches and seizures and give rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the \nFourth Amendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal \nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of \n$10 million. \n \nPage 35 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 36 of 46\nClaim Twelve \nFourth Amendment Violation \nDeclaratory, Injunctive, and Other Equitable Relief \n (Against All Defendants)  \n135.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84. \n136.  The Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in \ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \nsupported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, \nand the persons or things to be seized.” \n137.  Plaintiff’s telephone communications, emails, text messages, and other \ncommunications are protected from interception, search, and seizure by the Fourth \nAmendment. Plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephone \ncommunications, emails, text messages, and other communications. \n138.  Plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by defendants’ \ninterception, search, and seizure of plaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text \nmessages.  Defendants’ actions were not authorized by a warrant satisfying the Fourth \nAmendment, were not supported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and were \nunreasonable. \n139.  Provisions of the Patriot Act and FISA authorize defendants to acquire the \nconstitutionally protected communications of U.S. citizens and residents (i) without \nidentifying the people to be surveilled, (ii) without specifying the facilities, places, \npremises, or property to be monitored, (iii) without observing meaningful limitations on \nthe retention, analysis, and dissemination of acquired information, (iv) without obtaining \nindividualized warrants based on criminal or foreign intelligence probable cause, and (v) \nwithout making prior administrative determinations that the targets of surveillance are \nPage 36 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 37 of 46\nforeign agents or connected in any way, however tenuously, to terrorism. \n140.  On information and belief, defendants continue to collect, retain, use, and \ndisclose plaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text messages, and information derived \ntherefrom, that defendants unconstitutionally seized.  By these actions, defendants are \nirreparably harming plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law for defendants’ \ncontinuing unlawful conduct, and defendants will continue to violate plaintiff’s legal \nrights unless enjoined and restrained by this Court.  Plaintiff seeks an injunction \nrequiring defendants to return or destroy any of plaintiff’s unconstitutionally seized \ntelephone calls, emails, or text messages, or information derived therefrom, that \ndefendants continue to retain, and prohibiting any use or disclosure of those \ncommunications and information. \n141.  It is a policy, custom, and practice of defendants routinely to intercept, \nsearch, and seize telephone calls, emails, and text messages of Muslim Americans \nwithout probable cause that they have committed a crime or are agents of a foreign \npower. To prevent him from continuing to be targeted now and in the future, plaintiff \nseeks a declaration that the provisions of the Patriot Act and FISA which permit the \nfederal government secretly to collect, disseminate, and retain information from a \nperson and which allow one to perform electronic surveillance and wiretaps of a person \nwithout first demonstrating to a court the existence of probable cause that the person \nhas committed a crime are unconstitutional. \n \nPage 37 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 38 of 46\nClaim Thirteen \nViolation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nDamages \n(Against Defendants United States of America, Defendant Noordeloos, John Doe \nI, and John/Jane Does XI-XX) \n \n142.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84. \n143.  On information and belief, defendants unlawfully engaged in electronic \nsurveillance of plaintiff and unlawfully used and/or disclosed information obtained by \nelectronic surveillance of plaintiff, in violation of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 (i), 1804(a), and \n1806(a). \n144.  The electronic surveillance was done under purported FISA authority. \n145.  On information and belief, the information derived from the electronic \nsurveillance of plaintiff was willfully, knowingly, and recklessly disseminated for the \nunlawful purpose of interrogating plaintiff without counsel and coercing plaintiff to turn \ninformant and then to cause his torture by proxy in the UAE. \n146.  Plaintiff and his brother are not foreign powers or agents of foreign \npowers, and there has never been any probable cause to believe so.  The information \nobtained from defendants’ electronic surveillance of their communications is not foreign \nintelligence information.  Obtaining foreign intelligence was not the primary purpose and \nwas not a significant purpose of defendants’ electronic surveillance of plaintiff’s \ncommunications.  The information defendants obtained from their electronic surveillance \nof plaintiff’s communications could have been obtained by normal investigative \ntechniques, e.g., normal criminal wiretap warrants conforming to the Fourth \nAmendment’s warrant requirement.    \n147.  The electronic surveillance was not authorized or conducted pursuant to \nPage 38 - FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, Civil No. 3:13-cv-00899 (BR) \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 87    Filed 11/29/15    Page 39 of 46\nthe strict FISA procedural requirements, certifications, and privacy protections for U.S. \npersons, and/or the minimization procedures that apply only to foreign intelligence and \nnot open-ended domestic intelligence activities.  \n148.

Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 84. \n150.  On information and belief, defendants United States, FBI, NSA, and John \nDoes XI-XX intercepted and/or acquired, disseminated, and otherwise utilized plaintiff’s \nstored communications, including but not limited to emails and text messages, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2703.     \n151.  Plaintiff did not decide to pursue commercial activities in East Africa until \nlate December 2009. Plaintiff was first interrogated in Sudan in April 2010, during which \ninterrogation defendants used illegally obtained electronic communications. At least \nsome of these communications were clearly in electronic storage for fewer than 180 \ndays. Even if the illegally acquired communications had been in storage for more than \n180 days, those communications were not obtained in compliance with 18 U.S.C. § \n2703(b).  \n152.  Defendant United States is liable in damages to plaintiff pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. § 2712.

On information and belief, Defendants United States, FBI, NSA, and John \nDoes XI-XX intercepted and/or acquired, disseminated, and otherwise utilized plaintiff’s \nelectronic communications, including but not limited to phone conversations with his \nbrother, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2511 as required by 18 USC 2703(a)..     \n155.  Defendant United States is liable in damages to plaintiff pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. § 2712.  Defendants John/Jane Does XI-XX are liable in damages pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. § 2520(a). \n \nClaim Sixteen \nMotion For Return Of Unlawfully Searched And Seized Property Pursuant To \nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g) \n(Against All Defendants) \n156.

U.S. v. \nComprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F.3d 1162 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).  \n158.  Defendants have unlawfully searched, seized, used, and disclosed \nplaintiff’s telephone calls, emails, and text messages, and information derived \ntherefrom. Plaintiff is aggrieved by defendants’ unlawful search, seizure, use, and \ndisclosure of these communications and information. \n159.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  13.  This is a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief, and for damages, \nbased upon defendants’ violation of plaintiff’s’ rights as a citizen of the United States. \nThe claims asserted arise under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (substantive and procedural), and the \nFifth Amendment’s prohibition against self-incrimination.   \n  14.  This Court has jurisdiction over claims against the United States pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Jurisdiction over the individual defendants sued in their personal \ncapacities is authorized and instituted pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n  15.  The Court has the authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n16.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because \ndefendants are agencies of the United States and because this judicial district is where \nPage 4 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 5 of 20    Page ID#: 63\n \nplaintiff resides and where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaims occurred. Venue is also proper in this Court because two of the individuals sued \nin their personal capacities at all times relevant hereto either resided in, worked in, or \nwere assigned to and/or reported to this District. \nIV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  17.  Air travel is the only practical means of passenger transportation between \nthe North American continent and Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. \n  18.  Defendant FBI is responsible for the maintenance of the \"No-Fly List,\" \nwhich lists individuals whom the airlines flying within, into, or over the United States may \nnot transport. \n  19.  Most individuals on the No-Fly List, and plaintiff in this action, are \nprohibited from flying into, out of, or over United States and Canadian airspace.  \n  20.  Plaintiff is a 33-year-old naturalized American citizen of Eritrean descent. \nWhen he was a small boy war broke out in Eritrea, and thus his family took him to \nSudan, where he was when the State of Eritrea came into being in 1993; consequently, \nplaintiff is not a citizen of Eritrea. From Sudan the Fikre family emigrated to the United \nStates. \n  21.  Beginning in 2006, plaintiff resided in Portland, Oregon. In late December \n2009, after working for an American cell phone company, plaintiff decided attempt to \ndistribute and retail sale of consumer electronic products in East Africa. He began by \nreturning to Sudan, where some of his extended family still reside. Upon arrival in \nSudan plaintiff, in compliance with a recommendation by State Department, contacted \nthe United States Consulate in Khartoum and informed a representative of the \nPage 5 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 6 of 20    Page ID#: 64\n \nconsulate of his interest in pursuing business opportunities in the country. The \nrepresentative encouraged plaintiff to pursue business opportunities in Sudan. In \nreliance upon the representative's recommendation plaintiff began the process of \nobtaining a Sudanese business license. \n  22.  On or about April 21, 2010, plaintiff was informed by his wife in the United \nStates that she had received a telephone call from the United States Embassy in \nKhartoum requesting that plaintiff contact defendant Noordeloos, who claimed to be an \nofficial at the embassy and whose telephone number his wife gave to plaintiff. On the \nsame day, at approximately 9 p.m. local time, plaintiff called the number given and \nspoke with defendant Noordeloos. Defendant Noordeloos stated that a number of \nAmericans in Sudan had been invited to the Embassy for a luncheon the following day \nin order to discuss how Americans might stay safe during a period of political turmoil in \nSudan. Plaintiff agreed to attend the luncheon on that basis. \n23.  The next morning plaintiff appeared at the embassy. After going through \nsecurity screening, plaintiff met defendant Noordeloos and another person, defendant \nJohn Doe I, who identified himself as Jason Dundas. Defendants Noordeloos and John \nDoe I escorted plaintiff to a small meeting room and shut the door; defendants \npositioning themselves between plaintiff and the door. At that point defendants \nNoordeloos and John Doe I produced badges and stated that they were FBI agents \nassigned to the Portland office.  \n24.  Upon being informed that defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I were \nFBI agents from the Portland office, plaintiff stated that he wanted to be represented by \nhis legal counsel (plaintiff was then represented by Oregon attorney Brandon Mayfield) \nPage 6 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 7 of 20    Page ID#: 65\n \nduring the interrogation. Defendant Noordeloos denied Mr. Fikre’s request for such \nrepresentation on the grounds that plaintiff had been placed on the No-Fly List and thus \ncould not return to the United States to confer with his attorney.  \n25.  Because defendants John Doe I and Noordeloos were blocking the door, \nplaintiff felt he could not leave. During the following interrogation defendants Noordeloos \nand John Doe I questioned plaintiff extensively about the events, activities, and \nleadership at the As-Saber Mosque in Portland, which plaintiff had attended for prayer \nservices. Defendant Noordeloos also questioned plaintiff about the source of his \nfinancial support for this business endeavors in Sudan, and told plaintiff that, because of \nthe Sudan sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, it was illegal for \nplaintiff to engage in business transactions in Sudan - a statement that is inconsistent \nwith the advice and recommendation earlier given by the representative of the embassy.  \n26.  Defendant Noordeloos next told plaintiff that the FBI desired plaintiff to \nbecome an FBI informant to work upon “a case” that was then developing. Defendant \nNoordeloos stated that, in return, plaintiff would be paid substantial compensation, be in \na position to enjoy “the good life,” and that the FBI would take steps to remove plaintiff \nfrom the No-Fly List. Defendant Noordeloos then asked, \"Don't you love your wife?\", \nwhich question plaintiff considered an implicit threat. Plaintiff responded that he did not \nwish to become an FBI informant. The interview lasted for several hours until the close \nof the business day. As the day wore on, defendant Noordeloos suggested that they \nresume the discussion on the following day; in order to escape the interrogation room \nand leave the embassy, plaintiff agreed. \nPage 7 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 8 of 20    Page ID#: 66\n \n27.  At approximately 8:45 a.m. on the following morning, plaintiff called \ndefendant Noordeloos and stated that he did not wish to meet further with the FBI \nagents because he would be wasting their and his time; he reiterated that he did not \nwish to become an informant for the FBI. Defendant Noordeloos became agitated and, \nto the best of plaintiff's recollection, stated, \"Wait a minute! Are you trying to tell me you \ndon't want to work with us!\" Defendant Noordeloos then stated that, \"Whenever you \nwant to go home you come to the embassy.\"  \n28.  On May 4, 2011, defendant Noordeloos wrote an email to plaintiff which \nstated: \nYonas, \nThanks for meeting with us last week in Sudan. While we hope to get your \nside of issues we keep hearing about, the choice is yours to make. The \ntime to help yourself is now. \nBe safe in Sudan, \nDave Noordeloos \n \n29.  Plaintiff remained in Khartoum for almost two months following his \nmeeting with defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I. During that time he noticed that \nhe was being followed by persons he assumed were affiliated with the Sudanese secret \npolice, and he was told my merchants and other acquaintances that similar individuals \nhad been inquiring about him and his activities. \n30.  On or about June 15, 2010, plaintiff left Sudan, and on or about \nSeptember 15, 2010, plaintiff arrived in the United Arab Emirates to pursue similar \nbusiness interests involving the distribution and retail sale of consumer electronics \nthere. Plaintiff moved to the city of Al Ain in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, where he sought \nPage 8 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 9 of 20    Page ID#: 67\n \nand obtained a residency permit from the UAE in order to conduct business; he invested \nsubstantial financial resources provided by family members in pursuing that course. \n31.  In the evening of June 1, 2011, persons unknown to plaintiff (who plaintiff \nlater learned were UAE plainclothes secret police) invaded plaintiff's home in Al Ain, \nseized some of his personal property (computer, phone, etc.), and compelled plaintiff to \naccompany them in a vehicle. Several of plaintiff's friends and neighbors witnessed \nplaintiff's apprehension. Plaintiff was blindfolded, placed in a confined space in the \nvehicle, and the air conditioner in the vehicle was turned on high and directed at him \nwith the effect that he became quite chilled. \n32.  Plaintiff was taken to a then-unknown location approximately two hours’ \ndriving time from Al Ain. Still blindfolded, he was led into a building and into a long hall \nwhere, by peeking down through the bottom of his blindfold, he noticed that he was \npassing door after door. His guards stopped at one door and put him inside a \nwindowless cell where he was lodged. Upon removal of his blindfold, he saw that his \ntiny cell lacked toilet facilities. His cell contained only a bed and some bedding. The cell \nwas very cold because the air conditioning had been set on high.  \n33.  The following morning the interrogations of plaintiff began. Except for the \none instance noted below, during all of his interrogations plaintiff was blindfolded. Once \nblindfolded, he was taken to a room where, throughout his ordeal, plaintiff was \nquestioned for hours in English. Periodically during the 106 days of his imprisonment \nand torture, plaintiff occasionally was able to peek beneath the blindfold and view shoes \nand the lower torsos of his interrogators.  \nPage 9 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 10 of 20    Page ID#: 68\n \n34.  The primary focus of the blindfolded interrogations was events as \nPortland's as-Saber Mosque, addressing in particular who plaintiff knew at the mosque \nhad a \"jihadi mentality,\" what topics the mosque's leader, Sheikh Mohamed Kariye, \nspeaks about both in public and in private, and how fundraising at the mosque occurs \nand who engages in fundraising there. The interrogators also questioned plaintiff about \ncircumstances and events that plaintiff had disclosed to defendants Noordeloos and \nJohn Doe I during his interrogation at the embassy in Khartoum. Numerous times during \nthe blindfolded interrogations plaintiff's interrogators urged him to cooperate with them \nand with the FBI by becoming an informant.  \n35.  When plaintiff was returned to his cell at the end of the first day of \ninterrogation he discovered that his bed and bedding had been removed. The air \nconditioning remained at a high level, which made the cell extremely cold. Because his \nbed and bedding had been removed, plaintiff was obliged to sleep almost naked on the \ncold cement floor.   \n36.  During the initial period of his confinement plaintiff resisted answering \nsome of the questions, insisting that he was an American citizen and needed to speak \nwith his ambassador and with his attorney. In response, plaintiff's jailers struck him on \nhis head and he fell to the ground. Throughout course of his confinement plaintiff was \nrepeatedly beaten severely on his head, back, legs, and feet with batons and plastic \npipes, required to assume stress positions for hours, and threatened with death by \nstrangulation by use of a flexible plastic pipe. One particularly painful torture method his \ninterrogators used was to force plaintiff to lie on his stomach with his sandals off, \nPage 10 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 11 of 20    Page ID#: 69\n \nwhereupon he was beaten severely on the soles of his feet; thereafter, he was required \nto stand on his feet, which standing caused him great pain. \n37.  On several occasions plaintiff told his interrogators that the questions he \nwas being asked and the suggestions of cooperation with the FBI were the same \nquestions and suggestion he had heard from defendants Noordeloos and John Doe I; \nhe thus inquired whether his confinement and mistreatment was at the request of the \nFBI. On each such occasion the interrogators responded by beating plaintiff severely.   \n38.  As noted above, during his interrogations plaintiff was occasionally able to \npeek beneath his blindfold and view the lower torsos of his interrogators. On most \noccasions, based on their clothing and accents, plaintiff believes that his interrogators \nwere Arabs. On other occasions, however, plaintiff was able to view the shoes and \nslacks of several individuals who wore Western dress. Plaintiff believes that in those \ninstances representatives of the United States were present and witnessing the \ninterrogations and that those United States representatives controlled the questions \nbeing posed to plaintiff.  \n39.  On or about June 14, 2011, plaintiff was informed that he had to take a lie \ndetector test. During the test, for the only time during his confinement, plaintiff was \nquestioned without a blindfold in place. The questioning during the test focused not \nupon events at Portland's as-Saber Mosque but, rather, whether plaintiff's financial \narrangements involved soliciting funds for al-Qaeda. Following the lie detector test \nplaintiff’s bed and bedding were returned to his cell.  \n40.  On June 20, 2011, immediately after learning from plaintiff's family that \nplaintiff had been apprehended in the UAE (the family had learned of plaintiff's \nPage 11 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 12 of 20    Page ID#: 70\n \napprehension from witnesses who observed the event), the undersigned Oregon \ncounsel telephoned and then e-mailed the United States Consulate in Abu Dhabi to \ninform them that plaintiff, a United States citizen, had gone missing and that witnesses \nin Al Ain had viewed him being placed in a SUV of the type that is commonly used by \nthe UAE secret police. The consulate officials indicated that they would look into the \nmatter. Immediately thereafter, at the request of the undersigned Oregon counsel, \nCongressman Earl Blumenauer’s office contacted the State Department on behalf of \nplaintiff. \n41.  The interrogations, including beatings and stress positions, as well as \nbeing subjected to temperature extremes, sleep deprivation, and humiliation when not \nbeing interrogated, continued daily from June 14 through July 27.  \n42.  On July 28, plaintiff was informed that a woman had arrived to see him. \nHe was told that he was to meet with the American consul and that he should not \ndisclose to the consular officer that he had been mistreated during his detention lest he \nbeaten still more severely. \n43.  On July 28, 2011, plaintiff, accompanied by two guards, was taken to a \nmeeting room where he met “Marwa,” an employee of the State Department who, on \ninformation and belief, is of Egyptian extraction. The two guards positioned themselves \nclose to plaintiff, one on each side. Marwa was dressed in Islamic attire (a “hijab,” or \ncovering of her hair). By that time plaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds of body \nweight. \n  44.  The meeting with Marwa was short and superficial. Although by that time \nplaintiff had lost approximately 30 pounds, Marwa stated that plaintiff appeared to be in \nPage 12 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 13 of 20    Page ID#: 71\n \ngood shape. During the interview plaintiff attempted by facial contortions and winks to \nindicate that he was under duress, but Marwa either did not notice or disregarded these \nsignals. \n  45.  Marwa questioned plaintiff regarding what offense he had been charged \nwith, whereupon plaintiff asked the two guards what he had been charged with. The \nguards stated that plaintiff was being held without charge and that the authorities were \nmerely conducting an investigation.  \n  46.  Marwa’s visit was the only United States consular visit during plaintiff's \n106 days of detention and torture. Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff was \nreturned to his cell and the interrogations and torture resumed.  \n  47.  Following the meeting with Marwa, plaintiff’s interrogators constantly \nstated that he would be released “soon” or “tomorrow.” However, after approximately a \nweek of continuing interrogation and torture plaintiff became despondent. He believed \nthat the United States had “thrown [him] away,” primarily because of his black skin. He \nconsequently began to consider refusing food in an attempt at suicide, but was told that \nhe would be force-fed if necessary. \n  48.  Toward the end of his interrogation plaintiff again inquired of his \ninterrogator whether the FBI had requested that he be detained and interrogated. This \ntime, instead of being beaten, the interrogator stated that indeed the FBI had made \nsuch a request and that the American and Emerati authorities work closely on a number \nof such matters. \n  49.  On September 14, 2011, plaintiff was told that he would be released that \nday. His belongings were returned to him and money from his wallet was taken to buy \nPage 13 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 14 of 20    Page ID#: 72\n \nhim a plane ticket back to the United States. However, when the authorities attempted \nto purchase his ticket they were told that the United States would not allow him to return \nby airplane because he was on the No-Fly List. Plaintiff was not given the option of \nreturning to the United States by other means. Therefore plaintiff chose to be sent by air \nto Sweden, where he had a relative. \n  50.  Plaintiff arrived in Sweden traumatized, with few financial and other \nresources, and clothing entirely inappropriate for the Scandinavian weather and climate. \n  51.  In addition to being stranded with few resources in a foreign country, being \nplaced on the No-Fly List resulted in plaintiff's losing virtually all of his rights as a citizen \nof the United States - he could not return home to enjoy the rights, privileges and \nimmunities of citizenship. Moreover, his experience with State Department officials in \nKhartoum and Abu Dhabi demonstrated to him that he could not count on the State \nDepartment to protect or even to assist him while overseas. \n  52.   American passport holders are allowed to visit other countries for only \nlimited periods of time before they have to leave the country they are visiting; in the \ncase of Sweden and other Schengen countries the maximum stay is for 90 days unless \nspecial arrangements are made, such as requesting asylum. \n  53.  Upon arriving in Sweden and being unable to return home, plaintiff \ncontacted a Swedish attorney, Advokat Hans Bredberg, who suggested that plaintiff \nseek political asylum in that country. Believing that the FBI was responsible for his \ndetention and torture in Abu Dhabi and that he may still be in danger of abuse in \ncountries that condone torture (including the United States), plaintiff submitted an \napplication for asylum to the authorities in Sweden. Plaintiff understands that Swedish \nPage 14 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 15 of 20    Page ID#: 73\n \nauthorities have determined that he is not a supporter of terrorism, and that his \napplication for political asylum is pending. \n  54.  On April 18, 2012, a press conference was held in Sweden during which \nplaintiff's ordeal was disclosed publicly. Less than two weeks later, on May 1, 2012, \nplaintiff was indicted in the Southern District of California for \"conspiracy to structure\" \n2010 monetary transfers from his family to him in the UAE that plaintiff used to attempt \nto start his business. On information and belief, this indictment was in retaliation for \nplaintiff's publicizing of his ordeal.    \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim for Relief: Denial of Citizenship - Right to Return to Homeland   \n  55.  By placing plaintiff on the No-Fly List and prohibiting plaintiff from returning \nhome after his ordeal in the UAE, defendants effectively stripped plaintiff of his rights, \nprivileges, and immunities as a citizen, thereby effectively rendering him stateless in \nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n  56.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I, which deprived plaintiff of his rights as a citizen \ngive rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth Amendment pursuant \nto Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971).  Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $10 million. \nSecond Claim for Relief: Torture \n  57.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54.   \n  58.  Defendants, including defendants Noordeloos and Dundas, enlisted \nforeign intermediaries to torture plaintiff at their behest. The foreign intermediaries were \nPage 15 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 16 of 20    Page ID#: 74\n \ndirected to torture plaintiff, and plaintiff was tortured in accordance with defendants' \ninstructions.    \n  59.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and Dundas which deprived plaintiff of his rights as a citizen, \nincluding the right to be free from torture, give rise to a cause of action for damages \ndirectly under the Fifth Amendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents \nof Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Plaintiff has been damaged in the \namount of $10 million. \nThird Claim for Relief: Denial of Counsel \n  60.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54. \n  61.  Defendants Noordeloos and Dundas refused plaintiff's demand to be \nrepresented by counsel in Khartoum, Sudan, on April 22, 2010. Instead, those \ndefendants continued to interrogate plaintiff notwithstanding such demand and then \nturned over such information to United States law enforcement defendants, which used \ninformation gleaned from plaintiff in securing his indictment which is now pending before \nthe District Court for the Southern District of California. \n  62.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I which deprived plaintiff of his rights as a citizen, \ngive rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth Amendment pursuant \nto Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971).  \nFourth Claim for Relief: Violation of Right Against Self-Incrimination \n  63.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54. \nPage 16 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 17 of 20    Page ID#: 75\n \n  64.  By continuing the April 22, 2010, interrogation of plaintiff after a demand \nthat he be represented by counsel and inquiring into matters related to the pending \nindictment of plaintiff in the Southern District of California, Defendants Noordeloos and \nDundas violated plaintiff's right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to \nthe Untied States Constitution.  \n  65.  The actions, orders, authorizations, and other conduct of individual \ndefendants Noordeloos and John Doe I which deprived plaintiff of his right against self-\nincrimination give rise to a cause of action for damages directly under the Fifth \nAmendment pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).  \nFifth Claim for Relief: Substantive Due Process - Right to Return to Homeland \n  66.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54.  \n  67.  Defendants Holder, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mueller, FBI Terrorist \nScreening Center, and Healy’s actions in placing plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, secret \nNo-Fly List resulted in the violation of plaintiff's Fifth Amendment substantive due \nprocess right to return to his homeland once abroad. \nSixth Claim for Relief: Due Process - The No-Fly List \n  68.  Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through 54.  \n  69.  Defendants Holder, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mueller, FBI Terrorist \nScreening Center, and Healy’s actions in placing plaintiff on the FBI-maintained, secret \nNo-Fly List without informing him of such placement, the basis for his inclusion on the \nNo-Fly List, the means of removing his name from the No-Fly List, or providing an \nindependent forum in which plaintiff might secure the removal of his name from the No-\nPage 17 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 18 of 20    Page ID#: 76\n \nFly List, all violated plaintiff’s right to procedural due process under the Fifth \nAmendment. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:  \n  1.  Declaratory Judgment.  A declaratory judgment that -- \n  a.  Defendants rendered plaintiff stateless by denying him his right as \na citizen right to return to the United States once abroad in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment; \n  b.  Defendants' participation in the activities that led to plaintiff's \nimprisonment, interrogation, and torture at the hands of UAE authorities is a \ndenial of plaintiff's substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment \nand a denial of his right as a citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment; \n  c.  Defendant Noordeloos and John Doe I's denial of plaintiff's right to \ncounsel in the April 22, 2010, interrogation at the United States Embassy is a \nviolation of plaintiff's rights under the Fifth Amendment; \n  d.  Defendants' use of plaintiff's coerced testimony gathered during the \nApril 22, 2010, interrogation at the United States Embassy in Khartoum and \nduring his imprisonment, interrogation, and torture in the UAE is a violation of \nplaintiff's rights under the Fifth Amendment;  \n  e.   Defendants' placing name on the No-Fly List, which prevented him \nfrom returning to his homeland once abroad, is a denial of plaintiff's substantive \ndue process rights under the Fifth Amendment. \nPage 18 - FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00899-BR    Document 10    Filed 06/17/13    Page 19 of 20    Page ID#: 77\n \n  f.  Defendants' placing plaintiff’s name on the No-Fly List with no \nnotice thereof, with no reasons given therefor, and with no opportunity to \nchallenge the basis for such placement is a denial of procedural due process \nunder the Fifth Amendment. \n  2.
