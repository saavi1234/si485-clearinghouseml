    "summary": "<p>On May 1, 2012, the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Montana announced the opening of an investigation into the Missoula County Attorney's Office (\"MCAO\"), focusing on allegations that the MCAO failed to adequately investigate and prosecute alleged sexual assaults against women. (The DOJ also launched a companion investigation of the University of Montana-Missoula and its Office of Public Safety and a simultaneous investigation of the City of Missoula Police Department. These are listed as related cases, below. The DOJ reached agreements with these agencies on May 9, 2013.)</p><p>As the investigation neared a close, on February 11, 2014, Missoula County Attorney brought a declaratory judgment action against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Missouri, arguing that the DOJ lacked the authority to investigate or sue the County Attorney's Office under 42 U.S.C. § 3789d and 42 U.S.C. § 14141. The complaint and docket sheet are included in this case record.  </p><p>On February 14, 2014, the DOJ issued its findings letter describing the problems found in the MCAO's response to sexual assault, concluding that there was substantial evidence that the County Attorney's response to sexual assault unconstitutionally discriminated against women.  The Department's investigation - with which the MCAO did not cooperate - uncovered evidence indicating that the MCAO engaged in gender discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as relevant federal laws. In particular, the investigation found evidence that the decisions of the MCAO regarding the investigation and prosecution of sexual assaults and rape, particularly non-stranger assaults and rapes, were influenced by gender bias and gender stereotyping thereby adversely affecting women in Missoula. The investigation found that the following, taken together, strongly suggested gender discrimination: </p><p>1. despite their prevalence in the community, sexual assaults of adult women were given low priority in the MCAO; </p><p>2. the MCAO did not provide Deputy County Attorneys with the basic knowledge and training about sexual assault necessary to effectively and impartially investigate and prosecute these cases, nor did it generally develop evidence in support of sexual assault prosecutions, either on its own or in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies; </p><p>3. adult women victims, particularly victims of non-stranger sexual assault and rape, were often treated with disrespect, not informed of the status of their case and revictimized by the process; and </p><p>4. the MCAO routinely failed to engage in the most basic communication about its cases of sexual assault with law enforcement and advocacy partners.</p><p>The matter settled on June 10, 2014, with an out-of-court settlement agreement between the MCAO and the DOJ, and a separate Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the MCAO and the Montana Attorney General, assigning a substantial oversight role to the Montana AG. Under the agreement, the USDOJ agreed not to sue the MCAO and Missoula County. The MOU gave the Montana Attorney General the sole authority to supervise the MCAO in the handling of any case. It provided for hiring a \"Technical Advisor\" (at a maximum cost of $150,000 for a period of at least one year). The Technical Advisor would train prosecuting attorneys as well as MCAO's supervisors to meet standards set by the Montana Attorney General for the handling of sexual assault cases. Further, the MCAO agreed to develop sexual assault case policies consistent with the National District Attorneys Association policies and to provide training to appropriate officials regarding the handling of sexual assault cases for every year that the MOU was in effect. The MOU required prosecutors to make \"reasonable efforts\" to meet with sexual assault complainants and to provide information regarding decisions to charge or not to charge; it also required the MCAO to coordinate with other agencies to reduce the likelihood of discrimination in the handling of sexual assault cases, and to seek funding to provide resources such as expert witnesses to promote prosecution of sexual assault cases. Additionally, the MCAO was required to provide information to the public regarding the criminal justice process. </p><p>The Montana Attorney General agreed to supervise the MCAO's policies and compliance with this MOU, including the review of sexual assault cases for which the MCAO declined prosecution for the year following this MOU. The Montana Attorney General was to consult with the USDOJ to select the Technical Advisor, to review and approve MCAO's policies and guidelines for handling sexual assault cases, and to review and approve the MCAO's sexual assault training program. The Montana Attorney General agreed to also obtain and provide, after every six months for a period of two years after the date of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), copies of policies implemented by the MCAO regarding sexual assault cases, as well as general data on sexual assault cases.</p><p>Lastly, as part of the settlement, MCAO agreed to dismiss its district court lawsuit against the United States. The case was dismissed with prejudice on June 11, 2014.</p><p>On May 11, 2015, the DOJ issued a press release that announced that the Missoula Police Department had fully implemented its agreement to improve its response to reports of sexual assault. The release stated that the agreement between MCAO and DOJ in 2014 had been implemented and had improved MCAO's response to sexual assaults.</p><p>The settlement is now complete.</p>",

The matter led to an out-of-court settlement on June 10, 2014, setting out substantial reforms for the County Attorney's Office, with an oversight role played chiefly by the Montana Attorney General's office.",

Box 201440 \nHelena, MT 59620-1440 \nMESSAGE FROM TIM FOX, \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF MONTANA \nOn June 10,2014, I signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Missoula County, the \nMissoula County Attorney's Office (MCAO), and the United States Department of Justice \n(USDOJ) resolving USDOJ's investigation of the MCAO's handling of sex assault prosecutions. \nThis MOU outlined a cooperative agreement between the Montana Attorney General's Office \n(MTAGO) and the MCAO to ensure the success ofthe MCAO's efforts to improve its response \n•  to sexual assault.  As part of the agreement, the MTAGO and the MCAO separately agreed to \naccomplish a number of specific tasks.  These tasks and deliverables, contained in a separate \nAgreement between the MTAGO and the MCAO, signed on June 10,2014, included the \nfollowing: \n• \t The MCAO agreed to develop written policies and guidelines for the handling of sexual \nassault cases, to be approved by the MTAGO. \n• \t The MCAO agreed to provide annual training to its prosecutors in best practices for \nhandling sexual assault cases. \n• \t The MCAO agreed to adopt various ongoing practices in sexual assault cases, including \nin person meetings with complaining witnesses, improved use and communication with \nvictim advocates, designated sex assault prosecutors, and specialized sex assault \ninvestigation assistance. \n• \t The MCAO agreed to specific steps to improve communication with law enforcement \nand community partners, including entering into MOUs with local law enforcement \nregarding the handling of sex assault cases, collecting sex assault specific data, and \nsurveying victims and victim advocates. \n• \t The MCAO agreed to provide victim advocates with access to their JustWare case \n• \ntracking system. \nTELEPHONE:  (406) 444-2026  FAX:  (406) 444-4303 \n\n\n• \n•  The MTAGO agreed to hire Anne Munch, a nationally renowned expert on issues \nsurrounding sexual assault cases, as a technical advisor, to assist with training and \ndevelopment of policies and assessment of the MCAO's performance under the \nagreement. \nBoth the MOU and the Agreement described above outlined specific reporting requirements to \nensure transparency in this process.  Two specific reports are mandated.  The first is a semi-annual \nreport to the USDOJ from the MTA  GO with key data and deliverables from the items outlined \nabove.  The second is a quarterly report from the MTAGO, to be released to the public, outlining \nthe progress of the MCAO and the MTAGO under these agreements.  This document is intended to \nsatisfy the first iteration of each ofthese reports. \nI am pleased to announce that the MCAO is in substantial compliance with the various tasks and \ndeliverables outlined in the June 10,2014 MOU, and that prosecutors all over Montana are \nbenefitting from our efforts. To date, we have achieved the following tasks and deliverables \noutlined in the June 10,2014 Agreement and MOU, including: \n• \t The MCAO has developed a First Edition, Sexual Assault Policy & Procedure Manual \nwith over 300 pages of best practices for prosecuting Sexual Assault cases in Montana. \n•  • \t The MCAO attorneys have participated in five different sex assault specific trainings \nsince May 2014. \n• \t The MCAO has issued policy directives requiring the MCAO attorneys to comply with \nongoing practices outlined in the Agreement and the MOU. \n• \t The MCAO has designated prosecutors and a supervisor for sex assault prosecutions. \n• \t The MCAO has entered into MOUs to address the handling of sex assault cases with the \nMissoula County Sheriff and the Missoula Police Department (MPD) and the MCAO is \nconducting regular in service trainings with MPD detectives assigned to sexual assault \ncases. \n• \t The MCAO is participating in and supporting a sexual assault and accountability audit. \n• \t An in-house victim coordinator position has been approved by the Board of County \nCommissioners and hiring for the position is underway. \n• \t The JustWare case tracking system has been made available to Victim Advocates for the \npurpose of case management. \n• \n\n\n• \n•  The MTAGO has entered into a contract with Anne Munch and she has been helping \nreview policies and procedures and has recently provided a statewide sexual assault \ntraining for Montana prosecutors. \nWe are proud ofthe improvements we have made to sex assault prosecutions in Missoula and we \nlook forward to implementation ofthese efforts throughout the state of Montana.  During May \nand June 2014, the MTAGO provided three, one-day seminars around the State.  The seminar \nwas entitled \"Prosecuting the Difficult Sex case.\"  This eight-hour training provided prosecutors \nwith the knowledge and tools they need to take a victim-centered approach to these cases, \nconduct thorough investigations, dispel myths, and meet common defenses.  We will provide \nanother training seminar this spring focusing on the use of experts in sex assault and other cases. \nWe will also be making the First Edition, Sexual Assault Policy & Procedure Manual available \nto prosecutors all over the state. \nThis report represents the cooperative effort of a number of agencies, all working together, to \nensure every allegation of sexual assault is handled with the skill, competence and attention that \nthe victims deserve.  Given our tremendous progress in such a short time, I am confident we are \nwell on our way to ensuring justice for all sex assault victims in Montana . \n• \nA~·-\nTim Fox \n• \n\n\nMemorandum of \n\nUnderstanding \n\nbetween  Montana \n\nAttorney General's \n\nOffice,  Missoula County \nAttorney's Office, \nMissoula County and \nUnited States \nDepartment of Justice \n\n• \n\nMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN.

The purpose of this Agreement is to promote public confidence in the criminal justice system \nthrough agreement and cooperation between the MCAO and the Montana Attorney General by \nimproving policies and practices related to sexual assault prosecutions in Missoula County.  For purposes \nof this Agreement, the term \"sexual assault\" means sexual contact without consent as defined in Mont. \nCode Ann. Sections 45-5-502, 503, exclusive of sexual assault cases involving victims under the age of \n16. \nAuthority. Pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. Section 2-15-501(5), the Attorney General of the State of \nMontana has the sole authority to supervise the MCAO in the handling of any specific case.  Only the \nMontana Attorney General shall have the authority to provide input on the MCAO's deciSion to exercise \nits prosecutorial discretion with respect to any individual case, specifically whether to charge a case that \nhas been declined; investigate or direct further investigation of a referred sexual assault case; or take, or \nrefrain from taking, any actions related to the prosecution of charged cases. \n• \n\nTechnical Advisor. The Montana Attorney General agrees to enter into contract with Anne Munch \nConsulting, Inc. (hereafter the \"Technical Advisor\") for a total amount including fees, costs and expenses \nnot to exceed $150,000. The Technical Advisor shall assist with training attorneys in the Montana \nDepartment ofJustice Prosecution Services Bureau and the MCAO's supervisors to standards acceptable \nto the Montana Attorney General regarding the proper handling of sexual assault cases, and to assist the \nMontana Attorney General with the assessment of the MCAO's performance under this Agreement. \nThe Technical Advisor will only have the contractual duties and responsibilities conferred by the \nMontana Attorney General as may be needed to facilitate the MCAO/s performance under this \nAgreement. The maximum amount of compensation, including costs and expenses, payable to the \nTechnical Advisor will be specified in the contract with the Technical Advisor and shall not exceed that \namount. \nThe Technical Advisor shall not have any authority with respect to the MCAO's prosecutorial discretion; \nspecifically she shall not have the authority to direct the MCAO to charge a case that has been declined; \ninvestigate or direct further investigation of a referred sexual assault case; take or refrain from taking, \nany actions related to the prosecution of charged cases; or related to proposing or accepting plea \nagreements. \nThe Technical Advisor will be hired for a period of not less than one year, but may have her contract \nextended at the Montana Attorney General's sole discretion. The MCAO has agreed to seek funding for· \nthe fees and costs of the Technical Advisor from the Missoula County Board of Commissioners for a . \nmaximum period of two years from the date this Agreement is executed by the Montana Attorney \nPage 1 of 7 \n\nGeneral. The Montana Attorney General will work with the Technical Advisor to reach a mutually \nagreed upon fees and costs arrangement based on a contract amount that will not be exceeded. \nDevelopment of policies and guidelines for sexual assault cases.  Within 90 days of execution of the \ncontract with the Technical Advisor, the MCAD agrees to develop written policies and guidelines for \nhandling of sexual assault cases.  The MeAD agrees these policies and guidelines will be consistent \nwhere appropriate, with guidance of the National District Attorneys AssOCiation (NOAA) regarding sexual \nassault prosecutions and will include the following standard topics relevant to sexual assault \nprosecutions:  plea guidelines, internal timelines for handling sexual assault cases, including charging \ndecisions, coordination with law enforcement and community partners, communication with victim \nadvocates and complaining witnesses, response to stranger and non·stranger sexual assault, response to \ndrug· or alcohol·facilitated sexual assault, and supervisory review of case handling and charging \ndecisions. The Montana Attorney General, in consultation with the Technical Advisor, shall have sole \nauthority and discretion to review and approve the MeAD's written policies and guidelines. Following \ntheir approval by the Montana Attorney General, the MeAD's written policies and guidelines shall be \npublished on the MCAD's website. \nTraining for county attorney supervisors and prosecutors in response to sexual assault. Within the \nfirst year of the agreement and every year thereafter for the life of this Agreement, the MeAD agrees to \nprovide prosecutors, supervisors and the in-house victim advocate initial and on-going training in \nhandling sexual assault cases to ensure they are fully equipped to handle these matters. The training \nwill be consistent with the guidelines of the NOAA and will be approved by the Montana Attorney \nGeneral in consultation with the Technical Advisor. The training will include, but is not limited to: \nmethods of proving non-stranger, drug- or alcohol-facilitated sexual assault, sexual assault where \nconsent is a defense, the body of scientific knowledge commonly accepted as necessary for prosecuting \nsexual assault cases, effective techniques for interviewing sexual assault victims, and addressing \nmisinformation about bias and sexual assault victimology, including misinformation about victim \nresponse to sexual assault. The MCAD agrees, at its own expense, to ensure that deputy county \nattorneys handling sexual assault cases participate in any sexual assault prosecution training offered by \nthe Montana Attorney General. \nAssurances as to on-l2ing practices within the Missoula County Attorney's Office. The MeAD agrees \nto implement or continue the following on-going practices with respect to its response to sexual assault \nallegations, which the Attorney General shall have sole authority and discretion to review and approve \nin consultation with the Technical Advisor: \n•  In·person meetings with complaining witnesses:  Prosecutors will make every reasonable \neffort to conduct in-person meetings with the detectives and complaining witnesses prior to \nmaking a determination whether to file charges in sexual assault cases referred and \nrecommended for prosecution. Consistent with Montana law, advocates will be invited and \nencouraged to participate in such meetings between prosecutors and complaining \nwitnesses. \n•  ease related communication with victims and victim advocates:  Subject to the cooperation \nand availability of victims, prosecutors will communicate key substantive information and \ndecisions about cases and the underlying rationale directly to victims or their victim \nadvocates as required by Montana law. \nPage 2 of7 \n\n• \n•  Victim Advocates: The MCAO agrees to seek funding from the Missoula County Board of \nCommissioners for a full-time in-house victim-coordinator for the MCAO, in order to provide \nimproved notification, support, and referral services to victims and to provide victims with \ninformation not available to the Missoula Crime Victim Advocate Office or external \n\nadvocates. \n\n• \t Utilization of specialized sexual assault prosecution expertise: Within 60 days of the \nexecution of this Agreement, the MCAO agrees to designate an appropriate number of \nattorneys, based on caseload, to be primarily responsible for sexual assault cases. The \nattorneys will be selected based on their demonstrated skills and interest and will be \nrequired to attend periodic sexual assault-specific training. Nothing in this Agreement \nprohibits the MCAO from pairing less-experienced county attorneys with county attorneys \nwho specialize in sexual assault cases to develop skills, provided the deputy county attorney \nwho specializes in sexual assault cases has primary responsibilities in the prosecution. In \naddition, the MCAO will utilize the services of specialized prosecution expertise within the \nMontana Department of Justice Prosecution Services Bureau whenever the necessary \nexpertise for a particular sexual assault prosecution is not available within the MCAO or, \nbecause of caseload demands, is unreasonably delayed. \n• \t Utilization of specialized sexual assault investigation expertise: The parties acknowledge the \nMCAO does not employ internal investigators, but rather relies upon the investigatory . \nexpertise of cooperating law enforcement agencies.  However, in evaluating cases and \n• \n preparing prosecutions for trial, the MCAO does review and evaluate investigations and may \nrequest further investigatory efforts when necessary to making a charging decision or in \npreparing a case for trial. The MCAO will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding \n(MOU) with local law enforcement agencies to formalize past practices and ensure that \nappropriate and adequate investigative services are available to prosecutors for the \nhandling of sexual assault cases from referral through trial. The MOU will include the· \nprovision that if, after case referral to the MCAO, further investigation is necessary, the \nMCAO will request further investigation from law enforcement or the Montana Department \nofJustice Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI). The MCAO agrees to utilize the services of \nspecialized investigative expertise within the DCI whenever the necessary expertise for a \nparticular sexual assault investigation is not available within local law enforcement offices. \nIn addition, such expertise shall be requested whenever a conflict of interest would prevent \nan objective investigation or caseload demands on local law enforcement would \nunreasonably delay an investigation. \nNothing herein shall be construed to, or is intended to infer, that the MCAO has supervisory \nauthority over, or control of, the investigatory functions of law enforcement. \n• \t Computer Tracking System: Unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties, the \nMCAO will, within 120 days of the date of this Agreement and at MCAO's cost, design and \nimplement a computer tracking system for victim advocates and victims to track the status \nof their cases.  Subject to privacy limitations imposed by state and federal laws, the \ninformation in this tracking system will be accessible by in-house and external victim \nadvocates. \nPage 3 of7 \n\nit \n• \t Supervisor Review:  The MCAO agrees to continue enhanced supervision of prosecuting \nattorneys responsible for prosecuting sexual assault cases. \nSupervisors will closely evaluate sexual assault investigations and prosecutions and ensure \nthat such prosecutions are not undermined by lack of knowledge or impermissible bias and \nare conducted with the same level of attention and quality as prosecutions of other crimes. \nSupervisors will review and approve decisions to decline prosecutions in sexual assault \ncases. This review will include an evaluation to assess whetherthe declination decision was \nmade for any inappropriate reason.  Supervisors will document their review. \nThe MCAO will conduct a periodic examination of supervisory review data in all sexual \nassault cases, including closed cases, declined cases and cases where the complaining \nwitness declined to participate in the prosecution of such cases in an effort to identify any \nsystemic problems, including deficiencies or delays in the investigation, charging decision, \nand prosecution of sexual assault cases, and indications, if any, of gender bias. The review \nwill include information gathered from a review of case files and feedback from victims and \nvictim advocates. \nImproved communication and coordination with law enforcement and community partners. The \nMCAO agrees to implement measures to improve communication and coordination to effectively handle \nsexual assault cases. The Montana Attorney General, in consultation with the Technical AdVisor, shall \nhave sole authority and discretion to approve such measures, which will include: \n• \t Cooperation with law enforcement and community partners: The MCAO agrees to increase \nand improve its communication, coordination and cooperation with community and law \nenforcement partners, including the Missoula Police Department (MPD), Missoula County \nSheriffs Office (MCSO), University of Montana Police Department (UMPD), Crime Victim \nAdvocate Office, and community advocates, including, without limitation, the Missoula \nYWCA, JUST Response, and the University of Montana SARC program. These efforts will be \naimed at increasing the willingness and ability of sexual assault victims to participate in \nprosecutions of meritorious cases, facilitating the collection and analysis of relevant \nevidence, and minimizing the additional hardship that this participation can cause for sexual \nassault victims. These efforts will include: \n• \t Adherence to all agreed responsibilities set out in the Memorandum of Understanding \nbetween the MCAO and the MPD dated December 13, 2013 (a copy of which is attached \nhereto as Exhibit itA\") and which shall also be applicable to any cases submitted to the \nMCAO by MCSO or UMPD.  Exhibit A will be amended to 1) ensure that supervisors in \nthe MCAO assess the quality of sexual assault investigations, provide written feedback \nto the Missoula Police; and 2) provide more guidance about the responsibilities of the \nMCAO for cases referred for review. \n• \t Entering into an MOU with the MCSO with substantially the same terms as the MOU \nwith the MPD. \nPage 4 of 7 \n\n• \n•  Working with stakeholders to clarify, in writing, the roles and responsibilities of the \nMCAO, crime victim advocates and community advocates related to supporting and \ncommunicating with victims of sexual assault. \n• \t Agreeing to participate in and support the City of Missoula's efforts to organize and lead \na sexual assault safety and accountability audit. \n• \t The MCAO agrees to provide training to the MPD and the MCSO detectives on the \nrequirements of successful sexual assault prosecutions to facilitate effective investigations \nand minimize the influence of impermissible bias. \n• \t Public education and outreach:  In the interest of transparency and improved communication \nwith its community and law enforcement partners, the MCAO agrees to provide the public with \ninformation about the criminal justice process, including basic information about the roles of \nprosecutors and law enforcement in responding to sexual assault, the types of charges available \nin cases of sexual assault, and the policies applicable to plea negotiation. Such information will \nbe disseminated in a manner designed to reach the greatest number of victims of sexual assault \nand the law enforcement and community partners that interact with the victims of sexual \nassault in Missoula County, including through publication on the MCAO's website. This outreach \nwill include outreach focused on communities at particular risk of perpetrating or being \nvictimized by sexual assault. In collaboration with law enforcement and community partners, \nthe Montana Attorney General and the MCAO agree also to conduct outreach to communities at \n• \n\nparticular risk for perpetrating or being victimized by sexual assault. The community outreach \nefforts will be funded at a level approved by, and paid by, the Montana Attorney General's \nOffice. \n• \t Data collection: To identify shortcomings and assess improvement, the MCAO agrees to \ncollect specific information about decisions related to sexual assault referrals, initial \nmeetings with victims, charging deCisions, plea offers, case dispositions, and sentences, \nincluding, but not limited to, the dates and periods of time between each of these steps in \nthe MCAO's handling of a sexual assault case.  Except as to confidential criminal justice \ninformation, the MCAO agrees to collect and disseminate on a quarterly basis aggregate \ndata on sexual assault cases to the Montana Attorney General and the public. \n• \t Victim and advocate survev::  The MCAO agrees to participate in the victim survey program \ncurrently underway through the University of Montana to obtain feedback from victims and \nadvocates to help the MCAO continue to improve its handling of sexual assault cases. The \nMeAO will work cooperatively with the Missoula Police Department and the University of \nMontana to ensure that the sexual assault victim survey includes questions about the \nexperience of sexual assault victims with the MCAO, including those victims who decline to \nparticipate in an investigation. The MCAO will seek to include questions asking whether and \nwhen victims meet with prosecutors; whether and how prosecutors prepare victims for \nproceedings related to the prosecution of their cases, including motions hearings, trials, and \nsentencing; whether and how prosecutors describe the prosecution process to victims; and \nwhether and how prosecutors inform victims about their rights during the investigative or \npretrial phases, during trial, and after trial and sentencing. \nPage 50f7 \n\nExpert Witness Expenses. In order to facilitate and support prosecution of sexual assault cases, the \nMCAD will seek additional funding from the Missoula County Board of Commissioners in the amount of \n$10,000 a year for the next two fiscal years for the purpose of paying expert witnesses who may be \nneeded to provide additional evidence in such cases.

Following \ntheir approval by the Montana Attorney General, the MCAO's written policies and guidelines shall be \npublished on the MCAO's website. \nTraining for county attorney supervisors and prosecutors in response to sexual assault. Within the \nfirst year of the agreement and every year thereafter for the life of this Agreement, the MCAD agrees to \nprovide prosecutors, supervisors and the in-house victim advocate initial and on-going training in \nhandling sexual assault cases to ensure they are fully equipped to handle these matters.

The \nattorneys will be selected based on their demonstrated skills and interest and will be \nrequired to attend periodiC sexual assault-specific training. Nothing in this Agreement \nprohibits the MCAD from pairing less-experienced county attorneys with county attorneys \nwho specialize in sexual assault cases to develop skills, provided the deputy county attorney \nwho specializes in sexual assault cases has primary responsibilities in the prosecution. In \naddition, the MCAD will utilize the services of speCialized prosecution expertise within the \nMontana Department of Justice Prosecution Services Bureau whenever the necessary \nexpertise for a particular sexual assault prosecution is not available within the MCAD or, \nbecause of caseload demands, is unreasonably delayed. \n•  Utilization of specialized sexual assault investigation expertise: The parties acknowledge the \nMCAD does not employ internal investigators, but rather relies upon the investigatory \nexpertise of cooperating law enforcement agencies.  However, in evaluating cases and \n• \npreparing prosecutions for trial, the MCAD does review and evaluate investigations and may \nrequest further investigatory efforts when necessary to making a charging decision or in \npreparing a case for trial. The MCAD will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding \n(MOU) with local law enforcement agencies to formalize past practices and ensure that \nappropriate and adequate investigative services are available to prosecutors for the \nhandling of sexual assault cases from referral through trial. The MOU will include the \nprovision that if, after case referral to the MCAD, further investigation is necessary, the \nMCAD will request further investigation from law enforcement or the Montana Department \nof Justice Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI). The MCAD agrees to utilize the services of \nspecialized investigative expertise within the DCI whenever the necessary expertise for a \nparticular sexual assault investigation is not available within loeallaw enforcement offices. \nIn addition, such expertise shall be requested whenever a conflict of interest would prevent \nan objective investigation or caseload demands. on local law enforcement would \nunreasonably delay an investigation. \nNothing herein shall be construed to, or is intended to infer, that the MeAD has supervisory \nauthority over, or control of, the investigatory functions of law enforcement. \n• \t Computer Tracking System: Unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties, the \nMeAO will, within 120 days of the date of this Agreement and at MCAD's cost, design and \nimplement a computer tracking system for victim advocates and victims to track the status \nof their cases.

I!  ' \nSupervisors will closely evaluate sexual assault investigations and prosecutions and ensure \nthat such prosecutions are not undermined by lack of knowledge or impermissible bias and \nare conducted with the same level of attention and quality as prosecutions of other crimes. \nSupervisors will review and approve decisions to decline prosecutions in sexual assault \ncases. This review will include an evaluation to assess whether the declination decision was \nmade for any inappropriate reason.  Supervisors will document their review. \nThe MCAO will conduct a periodic examination of supervisory review data in all sexual \nassault cases, including closed cases, declined cases and cases where the complaining \nwitness declined to participate in the prosecution of such cases in an effort to identify any \nsystemic problems, including deficiencies or delays in the investigation, charging decision, \nand prosecution of sexual assault cases, and indications, if any, of gender bias. The review \nwill include information gathered from a review of case files and feedback from victims and \nvictim advocates. \nImproved communication and coordination with law enforcement and community partners. The \nMCAD agrees to implement measures to improve communication and coordination to effectively handle \nsexual assault cases.  The Montana Attorney General, in consultation with the Technical Advisor, shall \nhave sole authority and discretion to approve such measures, which will include: \n• \t Cooperation with law enforcement and community partners: The MCAO agrees to increase \nand improve its communication, coordination and cooperation with community and law \nenforcement partners, including the Missoula Police Department (MPD), Missoula County \nSheriffs Office (MCSO), University of Montana Police Department (UMPD), Crime Victim \nAdvocate Office, and community advocates, including, without limitation, the Missoula \nYWCA, JUST Response, and the University of Montana SARC program. These efforts will be \naimed at increasing the willingness and ability of sexual assault victims to participate in \nprosecutions of meritorious cases, facilitating the collection and analysis of relevant \nevidence, and minimizing the additional hardship that this participation can cause for sexual \nassault victims. These efforts will include: \n• \t\nAdherence to all agreed responsibilities set out in the Memorandum of Understanding \nbetween the MCAO and the MPD dated December 13, 2013 (a copy of which is attached \nhereto as Exhibit  A\") and which shall also be applicable to any cases submitted to the \n/I\nMCAO by MCSO or UMPD.  Exhibit A will be amended to 1) ensure that supervisors in \nthe MCAO assess the quality of sexual assault investigations, provide written feedback \nto the Missoula Police; and 2) provide more guidance about the responsibilities of the \nMCAO for cases referred for review. \n• \t\nEntering into an MOU With the MCSO with substantially the same terms as the MOU \nwith the MPD. \n•\n\\W\nPage 40f7 \n\n• \n•  Working with stakeholders to clarify, in writing, the roles and responsibilities of the \nMCAO, crime victim advocates and community advocates related to supporting and \ncommunicating with victims of sexual assault. \n• \t Agreeing to participate in and support the City of Missoula's efforts to organize and lead \na sexual assault safety and accountability audit. \n• \t The MCAO agrees to provide training to the MPD and the MCSO detectives on the \nrequirements of successful sexual assault prosecutions to facilitate effective investigations \nand minimize the influence of impermissible bias. \n•  Public education and outreach:  In the interest of transparency and improved communication \nwith its community and law enforcement partners, the MCAO agrees to provide the public with \ninformation about the criminal justice process, including basic information about the roles of \nprosecutors and law enforcement in responding to sexual assault, the types of charges available \nin cases of sexual assault, and the policies applicable to plea negotiation. Such information will \nbe disseminated in a manner designed to reach the greatest number of victims of sexual assault \nand the law enforcement and community partners that interact with the victims of sexual \nassault in Missoula County, including through publication on the MCAO's website. This outreach \nwill include outreach focused on communities at particular risk of perpetrating or being \nvictimized by sexual assault. In collaboration with law enforcement and community partners, \nthe Montana Attorney General and the MCAO agree also to conduct outreach to communities at \n• \nparticular risk for perpetrating or being victimized by sexual assault. The community outreach \nefforts will be funded at a level approved by, and paid by, the Montana Attorney General's \nOffice. \n• \t Data collection: To identify shortcomings and assess improvement, the MCAO agrees to \ncollect speCific information about decisions related to sexual assault referrals, initial \nmeetings with victims, charging decisions, plea offers, case dispositions, and sentences, \nincluding, but not limited to, the dates and periods of time between each of these steps in \nthe MCAO's handling of a sexual assault case.  Except as to confidential criminal justice \ninformation, the MCAO agrees to collect and disseminate on a quarterly basis aggregate \ndata on sexual assault cases to the Montana Attorney General and the public. \n• \t Victim and advocate survey: The MCAO agrees to participate in the victim survey program \ncurrently underway through the University of Montana to obtain feedback from victims and \nadvocates to help the MCAO continue to improve its handling of sexual assault cases.  The \nMeAO will work cooperatively with the Missoula Police Department and the University of \nMontana to ensure that the sexual assault victim survey includes qOestions about the \nexperience of sexual assault victims with the MCAO, including those victims who decline to \nparticipate in an investigation. The MCAO will seek to include questions asking whether and \nwhen victims meet with prosecutors; whether and how prosecutors prepare victims for \nproceedings related to the prosecution of their cases, including motions hearings, trials, and \nsentencing; whether and how prosecutors describe the prosecution process to victims; and \nwhether and how prosecutors inform victims about their rights during the investigative or \n• \t\npretrial phases, during trial, and after trial and sentencing . \nPage 5 of 7 \n\nExpert Witness Expenses. In order to facilitate and support prosecution of sexual assault cases, the \nMCAO will seek additional funding from the Missoula County Board of Commissioners in the amount of \n$10,000 a year for the next two fiscal years for the purpose of paying expert witnesses who may be \nneeded to provide additional evidence in such cases.  In addition, the Montana Attorney General will \nseek funding from the Montana Legislature to assist county attorneys for such purpose in the next \nsession of the legislature. This funding is in addition to other sources of funding for experts and is not a \nlimit on the ability of the MCAO to hire such experts as are necessary to pursue cases. \nAssessment of this Agreement and Review of Cases by the Montana Attorney General.

can take the place of the hard work, collaboration, skill, \ntraining, and experience needed to successfully prosecute sexual assault \ncases, this is an attempt to provide necessary information to experienced and \ninexperienced prosecutors alike to assist in evaluating and trying cases and \nin developing relationships with victims and with community partners. The \nManual includes information on issues that prosecutors will encounter in \ntheir first sexual assault case, and in their hundredth.  There is no formula \nprosecutors can apply to every sexual assault case; however, the information  • \nin this manual will assist in developing critical, nonj udgmental, and sensitive \nframeworks for approaching the very difficult issues inherent in sexual \nassault cases. \nThis manual starts at the beginning; in addition to providing legal \ninformation and practice tips, it covers critical areas such as the stereotypes \nand rape myths seen in jury pools, society in general, and sometimes within \n1 A substantial portion of this chapter has been excerpted and modified with permission from the Michigan Domestic  • \nand Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board and the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan. \nOriginally published in The Michigan Prosecutors Sexual Assault Prosecution Manual (2013).

Several sections focus on specific issues in prosecuting sexual \nassault cases; however all chapters contain themes and practice tips that \nuniversally apply to responding to and prosecuting sexual assault cases. \nBecause of the prevalence of the stereotypes and biases surrounding \nsexual assault, we must recognize that sexual assault truly is not like other \ncrimes, and the scope ofknowledge required is broader than that required to \nprosecute other types of crimes. Prosecutors, therefore, must be armed with \ncurrent research and employ best practices, defined as \"commercial or \n• \n\nprofessional procedures that are accepted or prescribed as being correct or \nmost effective.,,2 \nThis Manual also includes detailed information about recent research \non trauma. Emerging research in psychology and neurobiology shows that \nmany common victim behaviors and reactions upon which rape myths are \nbased actually have a basis in psychology and neurobiology.  The \napplication oftrauma research to the prosecution of sexual assault cases is \nrelatively new; therefore a significant portion of this Manual is devoted to \n• \n2 Oxford Dictionary. \n7 \n\n• \nthe research underlying common victim behaviors that often serve as \nobstacles to successful prosecution. \nThe guidelines laid out in this Manual are intended to promote \nconsistency and coordination and reflect a comprehensive set of best \npractice responses to sexual assault. While these guidelines reflect the \npriorities ofvictim safety and offender accountability, the ways to get there \nmay vary from one case to another. These guidelines are not intended to \nserve as a rigid set ofrules, but rather as a solid foundation of information \nand guidance. \n• \nThese guidelines are based on the following principles: \n• \t We recognize that victims are never responsible, in all or in \npart, for their victimization, regardless ofthe circumstances \nleading up to or surrounding the assault, such as lifestyle \nchoices or behavior; \n• \t We recognize that sexual assault is the ultimate loss ofpersonal \ncontrol and autonomy and we are committed to working with \nadvocates, law enforcement, and our Just Response multi­\ndisciplinary team to empower victims by giving them choices, \nsupport, and respect; \n• \t We recognize that most sexual assaults are non-violent and are \ncommitted by someone known to the victim, and reject the \"real \nrape\" stereotype; \n• \n8 \n\n• \n•  We recognize that rape myths and stereotypes commonly \nemployed by defense attorneys, reflected in popular culture, and \nbelieved by some jurors must be confronted and dispelled by \nthe criminal justice system wherever possible; \n• \t We recognize that victims display a wide range ofbehaviors \nand emotions, and are committed to becoming more trauma­\ninformed; \n• \t We recognize that prosecuting sexual assault cases is \nparticularly demanding and complex, and requires expertise in \nmany areas, including trauma and victim and offender \ndynamics. \nThe gender-specific language used in this Manual is not intended to \nminimize the experience of male victims of sexual assault; we know that \n• \n\nmany men of all ages experience sexual assault. However, most victims of \nsexual assault are women and girls, and most offenders are men.  The use of \nthose pronouns in this Manual reflects that reality.  And because the English \nlanguage contains no singular gender neutral pronoun, the writing quickly \nbecomes stilted and confusing if one or the other is not used consistently. \nThe term \"sexual assault\" is used throughout this manual to refer to \nsexual offenses in general, not a specific offense. \nThis Manual is the result of a collaboration between the Missoula \n• \t County Attorney's Office and the Montana Attorney General's Office. Some \n9 \n\n• \nparts of this manual are original writing. We also reviewed a number of \nexcellent manuals from other jurisdictions and have cited many ofthem \nhere, including the Oregon Sexual Assault Task Force's 2009 Oregon SART \nHandbook and The Massachusetts District Attorneys Association's \nMassachusetts Prosecutors' Manual: Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault. \nWe want to express particular gratitude to several organizations who \ngenerously permitted us to use full excerpts of, and adapt several section of, \ntheir publications: the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan, the \nWisconsin Office of Justice Assistance, and the National District Attorneys \n• \nAssociation.

Prosecutors are responsible for assessing \nreports of sexual assault to determine if enough evidence exists or could be \nobtained to file criminal charges. Prosecutors must also consider the ethical \nissues involved in determining whether or not to file a criminal complaint, \nand to consider the victim's wishes and well-being in making decisions in a \nparticular case, with the understanding that going through the criminal \njustice process is not the right thing for all victims. \nWhen someone who has been \npower~ \nprosecut;rshqve:,cthe  to \nUY,U\", \nsexually assaulted comes to a  r~duc~  viJti:;: ')itraumtl and  helJr\nthen:~d}~c~tiae~ivors.~~llr\n• \nprosecutor as a victim, the actions \nthat prosecutors takes, and the choices the prosecutor makes, can have a life­\nlong impact on that victim. Research has confirmed that the initial \ninteractions the victim has with medical personnel, law enforcement and \nprosecutors have a profound impact on their recovery. Prosecutors have the \npower to help reduce victims' trauma, and to help them move from being \nvictims to becoming survivors - regardless of the outcome of the criminal \njustice process. \nA victim-centered, offender-focused response to the prosecution of \n• \nsexual assault crimes is predicated on the need to protect victims' safety, \n13 \n\nprivacy and well-being while holding offenders accountable. The goal of this  • \napproach is to decrease re-victimization by ensuring survivors of sexual \nassault are treated with compassion and respect. Myths and misinformation \nsurrounding the crime of sexual assault, along with the tendency of the \ndefense and jurors to focus on the victim's actions instead ofthe offender's, \npresent unique challenges in the successful prosecution of the crime of \nsexual assault. Prosecutors are uniquely positioned to educate the \ncommunity, jury by jury, about sexual assault dynamics and the tactics used \nby offenders. \n• \nThe need for prosecutors to support victims cannot be overstated. In \ncommunities that lack victim advocates, the prosecutor's office may be the \nonly resource available to support victims through the process and to educate \nvictims about their rights as crime victims - rights to participation, \ninformation, confidentiality, financial restoration and restitution.6 \nThe Victim-Centered Response \nA victim-centered response to sexual assault prioritizes the needs ofvictims, \nseeks to preserve their safety and restore their dignity, and supports victims \n• \n6 See Mont. Code Ann., Title 23, Chapter 24. \n14 \n\n• \nin their efforts to seek justice and healing. At its core, it includes: \n• \t Recognizing that victims are never responsible for the crimes \n\ncommitted against them; \n\n• \t Recognizing that offenders are always responsible for their crimes; \n• \t Recognizing that the victim's choices, safety, and well-being are the \nprimary focus; \n• \t Recognizing and respecting victims' choices about and input into the \ncriminal  response; \nju~tice \n• \t Recognizing that the victim is at the center of all decisions regarding \nrecovery and any involvement with the criminal justice system and \nthat pursuing prosecution may not be in the best interest of every \nvictim; and \n• \n\n• \t Recognizing that responding to the needs of the victim become \neveryone's concern and a collective effort. \nA victim-centered approach acknowledges that justice represents \nmore than a successful prosecution. It is important for victims to have an \nexperience ofjustice, regardless of the legal outcome of an individual case. \nJustice exists when victims are listened to and taken seriously. This is \nparticularly important given that victims often choose not to report out of \nfear that they won't be believed. Furthermore, research has increasingly \ndemonstrated that victims who experience a supportive and compassionate \nresponse, regardless of the criminal justice system outcomes, have lower \n• \nrates ofpost-traumatic stress than victims who experience a secondary \n15 \n\ntrauma in the form ofdisbelief and blame. The goal is to create response  • \nprotocols that mitigate the harm and trauma that victims experience and that \nallow individual survivors to experience justice regardless of the legal \noutcome of the case.7 \nThe Offender-Focused Response \nProsecution of sexual assault crimes should also be offender-focused. \nAn offender-focused response acknowledges that offenders purposefully, \nknowingly and intentionally target victims whom they believe they can \nsuccessfully assault. This includes \n•\npotential victims who offenders \nOfi~l'lders;purposely, knoJi;l,gly \naniiintentionall·· . \nperceive as vulnerable, accessible, \nwhom·  ·····;Fa \ncan \nh \nvictims  and/or lacking in credibility. The \nit  as  vulnera41f!~ \nacc~$$ible,  ~ndlor  ~ackin~lItiij;  victim's perceived lack of credibility\n\"f; \ncredibility~,  ;;l}~lif: \nis seen by the offender as an \nassurance ofthe offender's ability to escape accountability. Unfortunately, a \nlack of focus on the offender is exactly what the offender needs to continue \noffending. Therefore, an offender-focused response draws attention to the \n• \n7 Oregon Sexual Assault Task Force SART Handbook, p.6. \n16 \n\n• \nactions, behaviors, characteristics and, to the extent permitted by the Rules \nof Evidence, the prior criminality of the offender. \nAn offender-focused response requires knowledge ofthe nature of sex \noffenders and considers the following: \n• \t Adult sex offenders are often repeat \nor serial offenders; \n• \t Adult sex offenders often target \npeople they know; \n•  Adult sex offenders are often \npracticed liars who have a history of \n•  avoiding detection through deception \nand manipulation . \nProsecutors should incorporate this \nknowledge of sex offenders into the \namounts \nthe oJle~der'~ \ninvestigation and prosecution of sexual \nassault cases while keeping an open mind \nabout the facts and not prejudging the case during the course of an \ninvestigation. \nIn an offender-focused response, taking care to make decisions about \na case can only be done after a full and fair investigation, to do justice for \n• \nvictims, hold offenders accountable, and uncover the rare but real false \n17 \n\nreports.8 \"Knowing what we do about sexual assaults - that truth is stranger  • \nthan fiction - no sexual assault report should ever be dismissed or deprived \nof a fair and full investigation on the basis of anyone's initial reaction to the \nfacts. Offenders count on such responses, and our falling prey to them ­\nwhether it is the investigating detective or the prosecutor - it amounts to \nplaying into the offender's hands.,,9 \n• \n\n8 A study of false reporting research found that when \"methodologically rigorous research has been conducted, as \nopposed to estimates for the percentage of false reports begin to converge around 2-8%.\" False Reports: Moving \nBeyond the Issue to Successfully Investigate and Prosecute Non-Stranger Sexual Assault, Lonsway, Archambeault, and \nLisak.

Advocates playa critical role in this process. \nAlthough prosecutors may not be in the position to oblige all the \nrequests ofvictims, research has demonstrated that showing an interest in a \nvictim's perspective and giving consideration to her requests may have a \n• \nmore significant impact on the victim than the resolution of the case in the \ncriminal justice system. 11  \nTimelines \nProsecutors will meet with victims as early in the process as possible \nand, if possible, before the decision to charge a case has been made. When a \ncase is referred to the Missoula County Attorney's Office for possible \nprosecution, the assigned prosecutor will make contact with the law \n10 Parts of this chapter are sourced from the Oregon Sexual Assault Task Force SART Handbook and The \n• \n Massachusetts Prosecutor's Manual: Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, Third Edition, Massachusetts District \n\nAttorney's Association, 2010. \n\n11 \nOregon SART Handbook, p.49. \n\n19 \n\n• \nenforcement investigator within two weeks. The prosecutor will make \nrequests for additional investigation, in writing, in a timely fashion. We \nagree that \"it is best practice for prosecutors to take a proactive role in \nidentifying and acquiring information and corroborative details necessary to \nprosecute the case\" and that, in circumstances where a suspect has not \nalready been arrested, \"choosing to file or not to file charges should be \navoided until all ofthe information related to the circumstances leading up \nto and surrounding the sexual assault has been fully pieced together.,,12 \nIn cases in which a probable cause arrest is made and a complaint has \n• \nto be filed within 48 hours, a pre-charging meeting with the victim will often \nnot be feasible. In those cases, the victim meeting will occur as soon as \npossible. \nIn cases in which the investigator does not believe a prosecutable case \nexists, a prosecutor will be assigned to review the case. The prosecutor will \nreview the case within one month of referral or provide explanation for any \ndelay. The prosecutor will then provide written guidance as to concurrence \nor suggested alternatives, including a request for additional investigation. If \n• \n12 \nOregon SART Handbook, p.4S. \n20 \n\n• \nthe victim wishes to meet with the investigator and the prosecutor, the \ninvestigator will schedule a meeting. \nIn cases referred for prosecution and cases referred for review only, as \nwell as cases still in the investigative phase, an investigator or prosecutor \nwanting input or assistance can request the case be staffed at a Missoula \nCounty Attorney's Office staff meeting, a Just Response case review \nmeeting, or the weekly meeting between the Missoula County Attorney's \nOffice and the Missoula Police Department Special Victims Unit. Any \nprosecutor or investigator can request a staffing meeting at any time . \n• \n\nWhether a case is charged or declined, it is helpful to victims to hear a \nunified message about the case. The assigned prosecutor and detective will \nmeet with the victim and the victim's advocate to explain a decision to \ncharge the case, a decision to decline the case, or a decision to request \nadditional investigation before making a charging or declination decision. In \nsome cases, particularly those in which a decision is delayed by the need for \nadditional investigation, multiple meetings with the victim and advocate will \nbe necessary, although some victims may wish to minimize their contact \nwith the criminal justice system and will choose to delay meeting until the \n• \nfollowup investigation has been completed . \n21 \n\n-------------------------------------------. \n-- -\n•\nAdvocate Involvement \nOften, victims will have an advocate assigned to their case before the \ncase is referred to the Missoula County Attorney's Office, as law \nenforcement attempts \n~d~qca(~~plQ;y .a 'critical  ~(Ji,j{\"in  guidin& \n~ictim's;.t;ltell1jl  .~, mi~l)tt~$\"t\\ahd  tne~s~ \nW'il\nto facilitate contact \n~6r(Jugh' the' ~ri~inaljusti~e~l~~f'em and' · \n.\"einvalllaJjletui~he sui:c'itss({}f~.;·i:ase. \nbetween the victim \nand an advocate at the earliest possible stage in the investigation. Law \nenforcement will also indicate on the referral form whether the victim \nprefers contact from the advocate, the investigator, or by the prosecutor \n• \n\ndirectly, as well as whether the victim prefers to be contacted by phone, \nemail, or other means. Every effort will be made to accommodate the \nvictim's preferences. If the victim has not had contact with an advocate or \nhas previously declined advocacy services, the prosecutor, with the \nassistance ofthe Missoula County Attorney's Office Victim/Witness \nCoordinator, will explain the advocacy services available and make contact \nwith the Crime Victim Advocate Program to obtain advocacy services for \nthe victim, if the victim so wishes. \nRelationships with Advocates \nAdvocates playa critical role in guiding victims, their family members,  • \n22 \n\n• \nand witnesses through the criminal justice system and can be invaluable to \nthe success of a case. They explain the process, notify victims ofthe \nscheduling and outcomes of court hearings, attend court hearings and trials \nwith victims, and provide information about victims' rights and services \navailable to victims. They \"help victims and witnesses 'cope with the \nrealities ofthe criminal justice system and the disruption ofpersonal affairs \nattending a criminal prosecution during a time of personal trauma. \n\",13 \nProsecutors, law enforcement, and advocates should work together to \nprovide direct and referral services to victims of crimes and assist in \n• \n protecting the victim's right to privacy regarding personal identifying \ninformation and other personal information. \n14 \nAdvocates can be of enormous assistance to prosecutors as well. Most \nvictims come into the system having had little exposure to the criminal \njustice process. The complexities of statutes, evidentiary rules, court \nprocedures, and the multi-layered analyses involved in evaluating a case, \nnegotiating plea agreements, and strategizing and preparing for trial can be \noverwhelming for victims who are already dealing with the complexities and \n• \n13 The Massachusetts Prosecutor's Manual: Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, p.III . \n14 NDAA National Prosecution Standards 2-9.4. \n23 \n\n• \ndifficulties of coping with a traumatic event. \nVictims often need assistance remembering, processing and \nunderstanding the large amounts of complex information imparted to them \nby prosecutors, and significant misunderstandings can result if they are not \nprovided an opportunity to react to and process the often complicated - and \nsometimes gut-wrenching - conversations prosecutors frequently have to \ninitiate. Advocates can also provide notification and support services that are \ntime-consuming and difficult for prosecutors to provide at times, due to high \ncaseloads and full court schedules. \n• \nEvery effort should be made to develop a collaborative relationship \nwith advocates, preferably through a coordinated community response, or \nMDT (multi-disciplinary team). Developing collaborative relationships can \nalso result in prosecutors obtaining valuable feedback from advocates, on \neverything from the prosecutor's interviewing style and demeanor in talking \nwith victims and paying attention to victims' wishes and needs to courtroom \npresentation. The Missoula County Attorney's Office is a longstanding \nmember ofMissoula's sexual assault multi-disciplinary team (MDT), which \noperates under the organizational umbrella of Just Response, Missoula's \ncoordinated community response to sexual violence, domestic violence, and \n• \n24 \n\n• \nchild abuse. See Chapter 10 for more information about Just Response and \nsexual assault collaborations in Missoula. \nMeetings with Victims \nWhenever possible, meetings between the prosecutor and victim \nshould also be attended by an advocate. Meetings regarding decisions to \ncharge, decline, or request additional information in a case should also be \nattended by the investigator whenever possible. The victim should be \nconsulted as to who will attend the meetings. The prosecutor has the ultimate \nresponsibility to make sure the victim is kept informed of developments of \n• \nthe case and is provided opportunities to meet and consult with the \nprosecutor, and will consult with the Missoula County Attorney's Office \nVictim/Witness Coordinator and the victim's advocate to schedule those \nmeetings. \nDepending on the stage of the case, meetings with victims will \ngenerally include general information, case-specific information, discussion \nabout strategy, and/or consultation about decisions to be made in the case. \nHowever, it is critically important for the prosecutor to gauge how much \ninformation a victim can reasonably handle in one sitting. Some victims will \n• \nhave a great need for information in great detail; others will be able to \n25 \n\n• \nprocess only small amounts of information at a time and may initially need a \nsimple assurance that they will be consulted and listed to. \nThe volume of information prosecutors must impart to victims will \nlikely necessitate several meetings to orient the victim to the criminal justice \nsystem, even before the case specifics are discussed in detail. Some victims \nwill want to meet with the prosecutor frequently, while others will want \ncontact only when necessary. If possible, the prosecutor should consult with \nthe advocate and/or investigator before meetings with victims, particularly \nthe first meeting, in order for the prosecutor to get a sense of what the victim \n•\ncan handle. \nTips for Meetings with \nVictims \nIt;>Yi~1~':>critji  ~.  impt,tfilnt.  lor  the.. \nThe best thing a \nprose~utor\"}o  gal,ge~:r'kow  mu~~l \niliformatio~':i victim, can  reasonalijJ\nprosecutor can do when \nhandle in'o~e sittini:. \n\".'1 \ntalking to a victim is to be \nhonest - about the strengths and weaknesses ofthe case, the likelihood of \nconviction or of a particular sentence, anticipated defenses, possible defense \nmotions and tactics, trial, and any other topics. This includes delivering bad \nnews about a case and taking care not to promise anything that can't be \n• \ndelivered. \n26 \n\n• \n\nlit;' \nThe impulse;, to  shield a,/victim \nmay:' be  well-intentioned,'· however:tht1;htll:t;kl'v~f \nef!I1~,aling!;if1;formationi/ is an  a~;:fJ}(lt'iJtiis: \n(:ont;ol .awaYlrom  the  victim  bas~dtoi.i  ,\"  , \nsoiii'iOl1,e  'Ythlnks,)j best forA ··him.: \n\"lit; \ni~fl8J~~ii::~  ,nate:  disempowertny' . \n..... \n:R~:;~t:  n.eJ (~at\\has no' pJactilt a vict; \n.;..'  ,  . '  \ni~r:espiJl~N~ \nIt is important for prosecutors to remember that: \nDuring the course of a prosecutor's work on a sexual \nassault case, there will be times of setbacks and \npotential barriers, motions for suppression of evidence \nby the defense, rulings to bar certain testimony, and \n• \n\neven motions for case dismissal. When these setbacks \narise, it is sometimes a prosecutor's instinct to not \ndisclose them for fear they may unduly \"upset\" the \nvictim, particularly if it is a motion or ruling the \nprosecutor intends to fight. This impulse to shield a \nvictim from bad news may be well-intentioned. It is \nimportant to remember, however, that the act of \nconcealing information is an act that takes control \naway from the victim based on what someone else \nthinks is best for her or him. It does not allow the \nvictim a chance to make decisions about how to react \nand assumes that the victim does not have the \nemotional strength to \"handle\" the news, This is a \ncompassionate but dis empowering approach to the \nvictim, one that has no place in a victim-centered \nresponse. Instead of shielding the victim from \n\"upsetting\" news, the prosecutor should make sure the \nvictim has an advocate available to offer support. A \nprosecutor might want to inform the victim's advocate \n• \nwhen bad news has been delivered to ensure the \n27 \n\n• \nadvocate is available to the victim, if needed. \nSpending time to fully prepare a victim for all \npossibilities and outcomes of a case in the very first \nprosecutor/victim meeting will also help ensure that \nsetbacks, when they arise, can be handled in a way \nthat minimizes trauma to the victim. \nIS \nTo that end, prosecutors should: \n•  Develop a rapport with the victim, and realize that developing a \nrapport takes time. Prosecutors are put in the position ofhaving to ask \nvictims to trust them, as total strangers, with very private information \nabout a very personal, traumatic event. Without that information, \nprosecutors are less equipped to protect victims from defense tactics \nduring a criminal case, but it takes time to gain that trust. Let them \nknow you will give them that time. Victims should be encouraged to \nask questions about the prosecutor's background and experience in \naddition to questions about the case and the criminal process. \n•  Recognize that all members ofthe criminal justice system can have a  • \nsignificant impact on the victim, and on the victim's experience with \nthe criminal justice system. Every member of the criminal justice \nsystem the victim deals with has the ability to make or break that \nvictim's feelings about the system, and therefore his or her ability and \nwillingness to cooperate with and trust in the system. \n•  Take care to tell victims they are never responsible for the assault. \n•  Approach difficult subjects with care. Be mindful of language and \nnon-verbal communication. Some questions and statements that seem \nbenign to a prosecutor can feel very judgmental or victim-blaming to \nthe victim. For example, ask \"why did you decide to report when you \ndid?\" rather than \"why didn't you report right away?\" \n• \n15 Oregon SART Handbook, p.48. \n28 \n\n• \t\n•  Recognize that sexual assault victims can sometimes be difficult to \ninterview. \n• \t Acknowledge and empathize with the victim's fears. Many victims \nhave multiple fears: the fear ofnot being believed, the fear of being \nridiculed, the fear of confronting the offender, fear of retribution, fears \nofboth winning and losing the case, fear of testifying in open court, \nthe fear ofthe social stigmas surrounding being a victim, etc. Direct \nexpressions of genuine concern and sympathy are appropriate and \ncritical.\n16 \n• \t Give victims the time, space, and support to make decisions when \nreacting to bad news, considering a plea agreement, or preparing for \ntrial. Victims may need to process some things with you, and to \nprocess some things without you and come back to talk again . \n• \t\n•  Examine your own attitudes and experiences. \n• \t Be prepared to discuss the victim's concerns about trial and hopes for \nhow the case will be resolved. And, be prepared for disagreements. \nMany victims are reluctant to participate in a trial. Some victims feel \nconflicted about  l/\nS~t!n{ll' \".la/ull\nparticipating in the \nvi~#mf:;f6 \"\"   ll. \nprosecution of someone \n'meS \nof~:~ \nthey know, and some don't \n: p~(Jt£~cut(Jrlvictim  meetiri\nwant to see their offenders \nh1  sure thatl~;~i6(Jck\n/ \ngo to prison or register as a \narise,. caiz.;be\" handled in a wav that \nsexual offender,  , \t ,'\"'  ;', ',.  \"\", '\nparticularly in cases in \nwhich the victim knew and \ntrusted the offender.  \n• \t\n16 The Massachusetts Prosecutor's Manual: Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, p.117. \n29 \n\n•\n• \t Don't interrupt. It is a common reaction to try to guide, or even \ncontrol, a conversation with a victim, particularly when the victim is \nhaving difficulty staying on track. However, allowing victims to \n\nexpress themselves fully will give the prosecutor better information \n\nand can result in the victim trusting more in the system. To \n\naccomplish that, it is also important to schedule ample time to meet \n\nwith a victim. \n\n• \t Keep in mind that talking to victims about how \"hard\" the process can \n\nbe can sound discouraging to a victim. \n\n• \t Ask ifthe victim has any other concerns, fears, or questions and \n\nrespond fully and honestly. \n\nTopics for Meetings with Victims \n•\n• \t The role ofthe prosecutor. \nProsecutors should be mindful that victims, like most of the public, \nmight believe that the prosecutor is the victim's attorney and \nrepresents the victim's individual interests. Because prosecutors \nactually represent the state and community, this misperception may \nresult in misunderstandings and disappointment on the part of the \nvictim ifthis is not addressed and clarified from the first contact.17 \nThe prosecutor should also explain to the victim that, although the \nprosecutor must also consider the safety and well-being of the \ncommunity in deciding how to resolve a sexual assault case, the needs \nand wishes ofthe victim will remain at the forefront ofthe \nprosecutor's analysis of the case. \n• \n17 \nOregon SART Handbook, p.48. \n30 \n\n• \n•  Information about advocacy services, if such services have not yet \nbeen provided. \nVictims should be encouraged to use advocacy services; however, \nwhether to do so must be left up to the victim. If the case is getting \nclose to trial and the victim has previously declined advocacy \nservices, the prosecutor should consider making another attempt. \nBecause the prosecutor is essentially unavailable to the victim during \na trial, a victim might decide that advocacy services would be helpful \nduring trial. \n• \t The phases of the criminal justice system and the victim's role in the \nsystem. \nMost victims will want to know how the system works and how long \nit takes. They should be advised ofthe general chronology of events \n•  in a criminal case and when their participation will be required. While \nmost victims vacillate about their feelings about participating in a \npublic trial, it is never too early to let the victim know that is natural \nand expected, and that the victim will be consulted along the way. \n• \t Delays. \nRepeated delays in the proceedings can be traumatizing to victims. \nThe prosecutor should discuss how and why delays occur and assure \nthe victim that while attempts will be made to minimize delays, the \nrisks of creating appeal issues and/or ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaims must be considered in determining whether to agree to, oppose, \nor request a continuance of any proceeding. \n• \t Interviews. \nThe victim should be informed that every attempt will be made to \nminimize repeated interviews, but the victim should also be advised \n• \t\nthat interviews with the defense attorney and/or defense investigator \n31 \n\n• \nwill likely be necessary, and that additional law enforcement \ninterviews may be necessary if new issues develop in the case. \n•  Preparation. \nThe prosecutor should assure victims that they will be prepared for all \nstages of the case, from arraignment through sentencing and appeal. \nAlthough people working within the criminal justice system \nunderstand that the entry of a \"not guilty\" plea serves as a mechanism \nto get a case moving, victims are often unprepared to hear their \nassailants plead \"not guilty.\" Victims need to know that they will be \nprepared for their interviews with defense counsel and their direct \nexamination and cross-examination at trial. Prosecutors should also \ninform the victim's supporters about what they can do to support the \nvictim throughout the process and what is expected of them both \ninside and outside the courtroom. \n•\n•  Legal Protections for Victims. \nVictims are often terrified that they will be further victimized by \ndefense attorneys in pretrial pleadings or hearings and at trial. This \n\nfear is often centered on things in the victim's past that are not \n\nrelevant or admissible in the case, but most victims do not understand \n\nthat rules of evidence regarding character evidence and the Rape \n\nShield statute can exclude evidence and arguments defense attorneys \n\nmay want to use. While prosecutors should never promise a victim \n\nthat a defense attorney will not be able to use victim-blaming tactics \n\nin a criminal case, victims are often relieved to know there are pretrial \n\nmotions prosecutors can file to be sure victims are protected to the \n\nfullest extent possible, and that the prosecutor will fight to do just that. \n\n•  Defense discovery requests. \nDefense discovery requests are often significant intrusions into the \n• \nvictim's privacy. In the digital age, more requests are being seen for \n32 \n\n• \nvictims' text messages, social media, and other digital information. \nSome of these are subjects in which the law is just beginning to \ndevelop. Victims should be told that they will be informed of defense \ndiscovery requests or requests for such information by law \nenforcement or the prosecutor and why such evidence could be \nimportant to a case, and that the prosecutor will take care to protect \nany private information that is not relevant or admissible in the case. \n•  Media. \nVictims are also often nervous and scared about the possibility that \nthe media will cover their case. Assuring victims that their names and \nphotographs will not be used by the media can go a long way in \nhelping victims feel more comfortable participating in the process. \nProsecutors should also take care when writing Affidavits of Probable \nCause and other pleadings to not include unnecessary information that \n•  may identify or embarrass the victim. \n•  Victim's Wishes. \nVictims should be advised that they will be consulted as to their \nwishes regarding charging, testifying, and plea negotiations. It is \nimportant to assess a victim's ability to participate in the legal \nprocess. The best way of doing so is to establish a rapport with the \nvictim and talk openly about the strengths and weaknesses ofthe case \nand the victim's desired outcome, preferably with the assistance of an \nadvocate. \n•  Later Meetings and Discussions About Difficult Topics. \nUnless a victim is ready and willing to talk about the specifics ofthe \nassault, or unless discussing those specifics is critical to an initial \nmeeting (such as when additional investigation is being requested and \nthere are time-sensitive reasons for doing so in an initial meeting), it is \n• \ngenerally best for prosecutors to let the victim know in an initial \n33 \n\nmeeting that the discussion will not go into the assault itself. Victims  • \nneed to develop a rapport and build trust with the prosecutor; it is \nsimply asking too much of victims to expect they will immediately \ntrust everyone in the system while they are still processing the trauma \nofthe assault itself. \n• \t Victims' Rights under Montana law. \nVictims of sexual offenses have the right under Montana law to: \no \t Receive emergency social and medical services; 18 \no \t Receive notice ofthe availability of crime victim \ncompensation, community-based victim treatment programs, \nand contact information for the law enforcement officer and \nprosecutor assigned to the case; 19 \n•\no \t Receive information on the availability ofservices to protect \nvictims from intimidation, including the process for \nobtaining an Order ofProtection;20 \no \t Have a victim advocate present when the victim is \ninterviewed about the offense;21 \no \t Receive notification, in advance ifpossible, ofproceedings \npertaining to the case, including: the arrest ofthe accused; \nrelease of the accused; the charge(s) filed and an explanation \nofthe elements of the offense(s) when necessary to an \nunderstanding of the nature ofthe crime; hearings, trial \ndates, and scheduling changes; 22 \n46-24-201(1). \n18 Mont.

They blame victims, trivialize their \nexperiences, and minimize and justify sexual assault. \nProsecutors are forced to confront rape myths on a daily basis. We \n• \n confront them in our dealings with defense attorneys, jury panels, the media, \nand at times, within the criminal justice system itself. Rape myths are \nexploited by offenders and many defense attorneys, believed by many jurors, \nand internalized by many victims. They are not \"just a set ofharmless \nbeliefs....They encourage silence, shame and pain.35 \nRape myths are, at their core, a fundamental misunderstanding about \nsexual assault. It is against this backdrop ofunfair rape myths that \nprosecutors must evaluate cases, conduct trials, and persuade juries to \n34 A substantial portion ofthis chapter has been reprinted with permission from the Michigan Domestic and Sexual \nViolence Prevention and Treatment Board and the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan.

The playing field for prosecutors, who already have a \nsubstantial burden ofproof, is not level when defense attorneys unfairly \ncharacterize normal victim behaviors as credibility problems. Prosecutors \ntherefore must arm themselves with knowledge ofrape myths and the \nresearch that refutes them. \nThe science oftrauma refutes the assumptions, inferences, and \nconclusions people make about victim behavior. In order to achieve justice \nfor victims, science must trump myth, in the courtroom, the media, and \nsociety as a whole. It is critical for prosecutors to understand the link - or \ndisconnect - between societal expectations and the science of trauma.  • \nProsecutors must be adept at identifying rape myths, understand the ways in \nwhich trauma manifests, and be able to present the underlying science of \ntrauma to a jury. \nThe most insidious rape myths are those which make assumptions \nabout both victims and offenders - who they are, and how they behave.

Expectations of strenuous resistance, a hysterical response, a clear, \ncoherent, and chronological memory of an assault, and an immediate report \nto law enforcement are some of the most common rape myths. \nThis section will provide the groundwork to better understand the \ntrauma associated with being a victim of sexual assault. It will describe \ncommon responses to the trauma of sexual assault, stages ofhealing and the \nunderlying neurobiology oftrauma. The purpose is to provide prosecutors \nwith information in order to offer a positive victim-centered response and be \nable to effectively confront and refute defenses that seek to exploit ignorance \n• \n\nand misunderstanding . \nUnderstanding Common Victim Responses to Sexual Assault \nMany of the normal human responses to the trauma of sexual assault \nrun counter to the ingrained societal views as to how a victim of sexual \nassault should respond. For this reason, victim responses often are termed \n\"counterintuitive\" or \"paradoxical,\" in that victim responses are not what \npeople would intuitively expect.  These terms describe the perceptions of \nothers that a \"real\" victim should act in a certain manner.  A \"real\" victim \nwould do everything in her power to fight off the offender. A \"real\" victim \n• \nwould look and act like a victim; she would be hysterical and report right \n39 \n\n• \naway to the police. A \"real\" victim wouldn't have put herself in that position \nto begin with. \nIt is useful to underscore that sexual assault victim responses are \nanything but counterintuitive; they are in fact indicative ofhow the human \nbrain responds to trauma. In fact the presence of such \"counterintuitive\" \nresponses should support the presence of a real trauma, not negate it. \nHowever, because of societal stereotypes of how a \"real\" victim of sexual \nassault should behave, normal responses to trauma create credibility \nproblems for prosecutors in \nThe presence of \"c;lunterili;tuitive\"t!;Cri~l \n• \nthe courtroom.  For example, \nrl!sponses should s'upport t~,~;PreS(!ll~~J \no,',c fd a real trauma, 1I;0\"t I.le.gQ.,tf J~>jh ~•! ~  ~.::,::>.;( f?.:\nour society expects a victim \nof sexual assault to have all the details of the assault seared into her memory \nwith crystal clarity.  These expectations are held by jurors in sexual assault \ncases and they will be exploited by the defense to argue that the victim is not \ncredible because she did not conform to the expectations of how a \"real \nvictim\" would behave. Furthermore, because these myths are ingrained in \nour society, victims of sexual assault may believe them as well. Thus a \nsexual assault victim may delay reporting the assault not only due to the \n• \n40 \n\n• \nmemory impact caused by trauma, but also \nA sexualassault \nbecause of a fear of not being believed once \nvictim 's resp()~~eitlr~ \nI .'  thing but\\~;'P;'n)~i!l;,  she does come forward . \n.. ,  I.terintuitive/they' \ndrl!;in/a(;#;il'ldlctltiVtl;'oj \nThe following discussion reviews \n.• \nA;;':\":::!~j\nsome ofthe more common counterintuitive \n..' ·veriexpeetations.; \nab(Jut\"lJ~ftJ;fjictim; is  victim responses . \n.\", .\"   .' ·d·\"·  .\n;§uppose .... ;'. \nare strongly hil~~  Delayed Reporting \nDelayed reporting of sexual assault, \nedelim(~; \nthe vieti;;\") \n•  particularly in non-stranger sexual assaults, \n~:~:::~;~;~\nis the norm rather than the exception.

One may be because it does not fit the stereotype that most people \nare sexually assaulted by strangers. Thus the victim may not even recognize \nthat what happened to them fits the legal definition ofsexual assault because \nthe offender, or the circumstances ofthe assault itself, do not fit the mold of \nwhom our society believes are offenders. Another reason may be fears about \nthe consequences or potential safety concerns that may arise from reporting \na sexual assault by someone the victim knows, whether it is a family friend, \nco-worker, or former intimate partner. \nDelayed reporting of sexual assault is seen as counterintuitive because \n• \njurors expect that a victim ofsexual assault will report immediately to law \n~e!;Ii,~'1:;;.~~ \n\nenforcement.

It is \nJ~'£uqlf~ssault cases.  .  .. \n....  .  critical to begin to view delayed \nreporting as a natural and expected reaction to trauma.  Prosecutors also \nhave the opportunity to educate the jury about trauma - and explain that \nwhat is seen as a problem with the victim's credibility is really a normal \npsychological reaction to trauma. This can be done as early as voir dire, and \n• \n42 \n\n• \ncan continue throughout the trial via expert testimony and direct \nexamination ofwitnesses. \nInconsistent Accounts ofthe Assault \nThe effects oftrauma-related neurochemicals on memory may also \naffect a victims' ability to report a chronological or \"consistent\" narrative. \nNeurochemicals released as a result of a traumatic event may cause certain \nportions of the \n\nThft. imjiit~~·i\".A;jnemorj; \ntraumatic event to be \n and \nacc~;i,,~JJit:e;;by law \nremembered clearly, \n\n• \nwhile other portions of \n\nthe event remain fuzzy \np~~cti;e .\n;i: \nor forgotten \nstrategies \ncompletely. \nAdditionally, memories ofthe traumatic event may be fragmented and \nsurface in pieces over time. Thus, the victim's report naturally may evolve \nover time, but is then perceived by others as \"inconsistent.\" \nThe impact oftrauma on memory has major implications as to when \nand how a victim reports the sexual assault. A sexual assault victim may not \n• \nreport the assault right away because she has no memory, or unclear \n43 \n\n• \nmemories, ofthe assault. Furthennore, a sexual assault victim with an \nunclear or fragmented memory may not give a clear, coherent, chronological \ndescription of the assault, which may lead to inconsistencies in the reports. \nThe fact that memories come in pieces may lead to ongoing disclosure of \ncertain facts related to the assault, which some tenn \"layered reporting.\" \nThe impact oftrauma on memory is now understood and \naccommodated by law enforcement when officers are involved in \"critical \nincidents,\" such as officer-involved shootings. In these situations, the \ninvolved officer typically will be asked only to provide very basic \n• \ninfonnation immediately after the incident. A more comprehensive interview \nwill be conducted after some time has lapsed, often two sleep cycles, \nallowing the officer's brain some time to integrate and recover memory. It is \nnow best practice to apply similar interviewing strategies to sexual assault \nvictims. \nLayered reporting may create credibility problems as a case makes its \nway through the criminal justice system. Additionally, layered reporting may \noccur when some victims withhold or change facts of the story because of \nfear ofjudgment or criticism.  For example, although an estimated 50% or \nmore of sexual assaults involve alcohol, societal stereotypes hold that  • \n44 \n\n• \ndrinking makes a woman more sexual and available. A woman who is drunk \nmay be seen as \"asking for it\" despite the fact that the use of alcohol actually \nhampers the ability for a woman to give consent. Many victims may not \nimmediately disclose that they were drinking or how much they had to drink \nfor fear that they will be judged or \n\nThe;:'i:Forensi/Ii(; 1:!;X'lJel'lel1fll \nnot be believed.  When these \n\n(fE,Tl) \ninconsistencies come to light, defense \n\nattorneys, jurors and sometimes \n\ninvestigators, prosecutors may \n\n•  question the veracity of the entire \n\nreport.  Again, this behavior is \n\nnormal in response to sexual assault. \nWhen viewed through a trauma-\ninformed lens and understood in \nrelationship to the guilt, shame, and \nfear victims experience - as well as unrealistic or victim-blaming attitudes in \nsociety - it can be seen for what it is: a normal and expected behavior \nfollowing a sexual assault. As a result ofthis more sophisticated \nunderstanding of trauma and memory, new techniques have been developed \n• \nto obtain better information from victims with less traumatic impact. The \n45 \n\n• \nForensic Experiential Trauma Interview (FETI), developed by Russell \nStrand, acknowledges the ways in which traumatic memories are encoded \nand retrieved by combining the principles used in critical stress incident \ndebriefing and defusing, the neurobiology ofmemory and psychological \ntrauma, and the principles and techniques developed for forensic child \ninterviews, to interview victims of sexual assault. \"This method has resulted \nin reports ofbetter victim interviews by those who have used it. More \nimportantly, the FETI interview process obtains significantly more \ninformation about the experience, enhances a trauma victim's ability to \nrecall, reduces the potential for false information, and allows the interview to  • \nrecount the experience in the manner in which the trauma was \nexperienced....This technique significantly enhances the equality and \nquantity oftestimonial and psychophysiological evidence obtained. This \nmethod had also been shown to drastically reduce victim recantations, \nincrease victim cooperation and participation and significantly improves \nchances for successful investigations and prosecutions.,,36 \n36 The Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview (FETI), Russell Strand, United States Army Military Police School.  • \n46 \n\n• \nApparently Cooperative Behavior ofthe Victim \nOne of the immediate psychological reactions to trauma is the feeling \nof intense fear, helplessness and horror. Sexual assault victims commonly \nreport fearing for their lives \nan' \nIn  eitllGj;  ive\\/aituationi::::'ll'\nduring an assault, whether or  ,  '.I:.J( > , f   >' »,>  »>,\nvictim  m(1~\\I f!n~~g'e  in >.~ij~e;J6J}~~ative \nnot weapons, violence, or  'itk the >offende~, both;. dijring \n> \nandaltei; the  ass>  ):}lior ~.,!~ample,'\\.th.~ \nr\nthreats were used by the  tltil\nvlctimTflight give  t1,.ride huiii~ \nafter theas~fJult~>Ji\noffender. In an effort to \nsurvive the situation, a victim may engage in some cooperative behavior \n• \n\nwith the offender, both during and after the assault. This is normal. The \nvictim may be in shock and not making what others would see as rational \nchoices. The victim may be doing what she needs to do to get the offender \naway, or to ensure she survives the assault. The victim may be in denial and \ntrying to normalize the assault. \nFor example, the victim might give the offender a ride home or have contact \nwith the offender after the assault. This type ofbehavior may be seen as \nevidence of consensual sexual activity rather than sexual assault, and \ndefense attorneys will latch onto these behaviors as part of a consent \n•  defense. Prosecutors should anticipate these defense strategies in a sexual \n47 \n\nassault case, and educate juries to view these cases through an informed and  • \neducated perspective, usually through the use of expert testimony. \nMisunderstood Emotion \nSocietal stereotypes hold that a \"real\" victim of sexual assault should \nbe hysterical.  But the stereotypes also suggest that a victim should move on \nafter \"enough\" time has passed. However, as described in subsequent \nsections, victims of trauma have a variety of responses that may vary \ndepending on the stage of healing they are experiencing.  One common \npsychological reaction to sexual trauma is for a victim to withdraw or shut \n• \ndown. \nThis may manifest itself as \"flat affect\" in which the victim displays \nlittle to no emotion, which may be wrongly perceived as evidence of a false \nreport. Reactions to trauma can also \ninclude anger or irritability,  Victim/fexperience a wide ra~g~ \nof  emotions, . \nespecially in later stages of healing. \n.... ral\"o:K'~'/flatil.fj ...  .~1tis is \n.......

Prosecutors should anticipate a range of emotions from sexual \n48 \n\n• \nassault victims they encounter. They should also understand that these \nemotions should not be considered evidence of deception, but rather as \nevidence of a traumatic response. \nLack ofResistance \nMany people expect victims to fight vigorously against a sexual \nassault. There may be two reasons a victim does not resist during a sexual \nassault.  First a victim may choose not to act, being passive or even \ncooperating with the assailant, \nin an attempt to survive the \n• \nevent.  As has been mentioned \nbefore, most sexual assault \nvictims perceive that their life is in danger, regardless whether a weapon is \npresent, even if doing so seems irrational to an outsider. Passivity or \napparent cooperation may be the best way to survive the assault, or to \nsurvive without serious physical injury. Passivity or apparent cooperation do \nnot imply consent. \nAnother normal response to a traumatic event is tonic immobility (TI). \nThis response is one in which the human body enters a state of paralysis. \n• \nWhat is important to understand about this response is that it is an automatic \n49 \n\n• \nresponse, not a choice a person makes. Tonic immobility differs from \nchoosing not to act; it also differs from \"freezing,\" in that the freeze \nresponse in a momentary response and tonic immobility is an ongoing \nphysical paralysis that may occur during and immediately after the assault. \nBoth tonic immobility and making the conscious choice not to resist \nor otherwise act - both of which are perfectly normal and adaptive responses \nto sexual assault -- defy the rape myth that a \nBoth  \"to;nicl1ntl1obility,alld \n,  ~'.'.\"  \". '.: '.~>At+f~~~1;£\\:kc  ' :~:<' ' ..,  \"real\" victim of sexual assault will resist to \n(,i::conscious  choice, \n\nIstiJrotherwise d~t'~ \n\nthe utmost.

Many prosecutors have \nencountered a juror who expected that a legitimate victim would \"fight to \nthe death.\" If she does not, her \"acquiescence\" is held against her in terms of \n• \n37 Mont. Code Ann 45-5-511 (5). \n50 \n\n• \nher credibility. These rape myths are so ingrained in our society that many \nvictims may adhere to them as well. Thus a victim who did not act during an \nassault, whether because of tonic immobility or survival strategy, may feel \nincreased levels of guilt and self-blame because she did not fight back or \nscream for help. These feelings of guilt and self-blame, in addition to other \nimpacts of trauma, may lead to delayed reporting of the sexual assault to law \nenforcement. \nTrauma \nDefinition ofTrauma \n• \n\nPsychological trauma is a disruption of equilibrium that severely taxes \na person's ability to cope in response to an experience that is emotionally \npainful, distressing, or shocking. It may leave lasting mental and physical \neffects. Psychological trauma is a normal human response to an extreme \nevent. \nPeople often use the word \"traumatic\" to describe stressful life events. \nHowever, mental health professionals define a traumatic event in a very \nspecific way. According to the American Psychiatric Association, a \ntraumatic event must involve both of the following: \n• \n51 \n\n• \t The person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event  • \nwhere there was the threat of or actual death or serious injury. The \nevent may also have involved a threat to the person's physical well­\nbeing or the physical well-being of another person; and \n• \t The person responded to the event with strong feelings of fear, \nhelplessness or horror. \nTraumatic events can be differentiated from stressful events and crises \nby the nature and severity of the event.  A stressful event is one that \nprovokes a physical and emotional stress response. Stressors can be \ncategorized as acute or chronic, and as external or internal to the person. A \ncrisis is an emotionally significant event or radical change of status in a \n• \nperson's life. Certainly a traumatic event is both stressful and a crisis, but the \nreverse is not always true. It is important to note that an event is not defined \nas traumatic by the severity of \nAlthougk2,';!»QstFisexual;\"'\" \nit';;· \nthe reaction to the event but by  ~~~~!tin ·~al:,·~it.r~;l; \nexpe.,  ,  ....  .  of \n~'t!1?J!'t;  In, \npresence of the factors \niit1#~y antll~fd~~t~~during~~\" \ndescribed above. \nU sing these definitions, a sexual assault would always be categorized \nas a traumatic event.  Although most sexual assaults do not result in physical \ninjury, most victims report experiencing intense fear of injury and/or death \nduring an assault.  Sexual assault victims report feeling terror, helplessness,  • \n52 \n\n• \nand horror during the event.  These experiences and feelings occur \nregardless ofthe amount of force used, the presence of a weapon or the \nrelationship with the offender. \nThe Science ofTrauma \nAlthough the medical and psychological community began to recognize \nand treat traumatized soldiers during World War II, an understanding of \nnature and dynamics of trauma was propelled \ne.xperiences a traumatic \n\n····;r~lways  '.  into the national consciousness by the \n'.  tl}thileven \nVietnam War.

Yet, while \nconsiderable resources are devoted to the needs of traumatized veterans, the \nneeds of victims ofrape and sexual assault are not as widely understood. Yet \nrape survivors represent the largest non-combat group of individuals with \n• \nPTSD. \n53 \n\n•\nCommon Reactions to a Traumatic Event \nA person who experiences a traumatic event always has a reaction to \nthe event, although their reaction may not be apparent or logical to others. \nReactions to traumatic events involve conscious and unconscious \nemployment of coping strategies in the attempt to return the person to \nequilibrium.  Although these attempts to cope may seem strange, \ncounterproductive or counterintuitive to others, there are a wide range of \nreactions that are normal and even expected. There are a number of factors \nthat influence a person's response including but not limited to: pre-trauma \n• \n\nRtl£cilolJ~;; tt) \\ traumatic  evtll1!t~(  inv.·· . \nfunctioning, age at the  > \n,  ,  \"  ,.'  ,:;.'

Often they include avoidance of reminders of the event, re­\nexperiencing the event through intrusive memories, flashbacks and \nnightmares and hyperarousal displayed as anxiety, heightened startle  • \n54 \n\n• \nresponse, irritability, or insomnia.  There is significant overlap in these \nresponses across all types of trauma with obvious specification to the nature \nof the event.  Victims typically experience a range of cognitive, emotional, \nsocial, and physical reactions to a sexual assault. \n• \t Common Cognitive Reactions to Sexual Assault \no \t Minimizing the assault \no \t Blaming herself for the assault by thinking she did \nsomething to cause the assault (e.g. \"if only I had/hadn't \ndone X\") \no \t Feeling like \"damaged goods\" and worrying about ever \nbeing okay or be able to be in a relationship \no \t Feeling unlovable \n• \n o \t Feeling like a burden/not wanting to bother people \no \t Avoiding associations with the trauma \no \t Being unable to control memories surfacing \no \t Having difficulty with concentration and/or memory \no \t Worrying she isn't \"getting over it\" fast enough \n• \t Common Emotional Reactions to Sexual Assault \no \t Feelings of guilt/self-blame \no \t Shock and/or disbelief \no \t Hyper alertness/hypervigilance \no \t Feelings of helplessness, panic, feeling out of control \no \t Flashbacks (i.e., feeling as if the trauma is currently \nhappening) \no \t Nightmares \no \t Worrying or ruminating \no \t Irritability, restlessness, outbursts of anger or rage \no \t Grief, disorientation, denial \no \t Fear and/or anxiety \no \t Mood swings (e.g., crying then laughing) \n• \n\no  Feelings of detachment \n\n55 \n\n•\no \t Emotional numbing or restricted range of feelings \no \t Difficulty trusting and/or feelings of betrayal \no \t Shame \no \t Depression or diminished interest in everyday activities \n• \t Common Social Reactions to Sexual· Assault \no \t Tendency to isolate oneself \no \t Fear ofbeing alone \no \t Increased sexual activity or withdrawal from sexual \ncontact \no \t A voidance of friends and family/isolating \no \t Increased conflicts in relationships due to mood swings, \nanger, misunderstandings \no \t Increased need to control situations and environment \n• \t Common Physical Reactions to Sexual Assault \no \t Aches and pains, such as head, back, and/or stomach \naches \no \t Sudden sweating and/or heart palpitations \no \t Changes in sleep patterns, appetite, interest in sex  • \no \t Digestive problems -- Constipation or diarrhea \no \t Easily startled by noises or unexpected touch \no \t More susceptible to colds or illnesses \no \t Physical discomfort from sexual activity \no \t Increased use in alcohol or other drugs and/or overeating \nReactions to traumatic events usually do not involve the development \nofpost-traumatic stress disorder or mental illness.  In fact, only 8% of \npeople in the US who experience a traumatic event develop PTSD. However, \nthis rate changes depending on the type ofevent experienced.  The estimated \nrisk for developing PTSD for people who have experienced rape is 49%, and \n24% for people who have experienced other types of sexual assault. By \n• \ncontrast, the rate of PTSD for people who have experienced a shooting or \n56 \n\n• \nstabbing is 14%, and the rate for those who have experienced a natural \ndisaster is 4%. \n.Th'j~f:~fObioloii~at\"···'· \n/\" Sci' ;,;>,;. , c\"c  ·trau\", l••,;a~   is a'!; \nNeurobiology ofTrauma  'ction to:tht/ \ni!~~~~Rt:l\"  .,. \n<,' \nWhen a person experiences a traumatic  tbf~t,is ,not' \".,.  ,6Y\".· \n£=;~~:i;i \nevent, there is a cascade of neurological and \nhand alfa;lfr'l'mtttl!liO~\\f;';; \nbiological responses that occur during and after the \ns\"rfac~,,:  ....; \ninvolve$.. the \nevent.

This reaction involves the \nrelease of chemicals in the body that control respiration, blood flow, heart \nrate, muscle control, speech, as well as cognition and memory.  These \ninvoluntary neurochemical responses have a significant effect not only on \nthe behavioral response during the event but also on the memories and \nperceptions the victim may have and be able to communicate following the \nevent. \n•\nFight, Flight, or Freeze \nOne's reaction to threat depends on two factors: 1) the level of fear \nand 2) the proximity ofthe threat. An initial response to threat is to freeze. \nWhen a threat appears distant (spatially, temporally, or perceived likelihood) \nand the fear is low, freeze is the involuntary, momentary reaction. It allows \nthe organism to assess the situation, and avoid detection in the hopes that the \nthreat may pass without incident.  For example, the mouse freezes when it \nhears movement in the brush.  This response allows it to assess whether a \npredator is present, and if it is, the stillness may protect the mouse from \nbeing detected. In a sexual assault scenario, \"freeze\" may happen when an  • \n58 \n\n• \noffender first crosses a boundary initiating an assault.  Offenders may take \nadvantage ofthis momentary lack of response to further their goal of sexual \nassault. \nThe \"fight or flight\" response is next.  If danger is determined to be \npresent and fear is increasing, the chemicals released encourage a response \nof fight or flight. In the case of the mouse, ifthe fox has found the mouse's \nscent and is moving closer sniffing the ground, the mouse can choose to \nmake a run for cover, or bare its teeth and claws to take on the fox.  For \nhumans, this process is \n/{l.s; a,; sexual  asill;'\" \n\n• \n\nhapDen . when ,<tan.'\n\nmore complicated and \n'illitiaiJ~lf,,~;\"1J \n,\ncan involve a series of \nstrategies a victim may \nemploy from non-verbal communication of resistance (turning away, pulling \non clothes, non-responsiveness) to verbal resistance (saying no, pleading to \nstop, bargaining with the offender) to direct physical resistance (hitting, \npunching, biting).  It can also involve psychological defenses such as \ndissociation in which the victim may have the sensation of leaving her body \n- and detaching from the horror of the assault.  This can be a form of flight. \n• \n59 \n\n•\nTonic Immobility \nA less well-known response that is critical for understanding sexual \nassault is tonic immobility.  This response happens when the threat is \nimminent and fear is high - the victim's central nervous system feels there is \nno escape.  It is similar to what occurs when the mouse is trapped under the \nfox's paw and he can feel the fox's mouth is closing around him.  The \nchemicals released involve a type ofparalysis - a profound motor inhibition. \nThe victim is physically unable to move or respond, and the ability to speak \nis lost.  Victims often describe feeling unable to speak or move; tonic \n•\nimmobility may be the reason. \nThis paralysis may have a few benefits to the victim.  One common \nphrase that describes it is \"playing possum.\"  Tonic immobility may serve as \nan involuntary form of playing possum, increasing the prey's chance of \nsurvival because the predator believes its prey already dead.  The predator \nmay leave the victim to return for a meal later - allowing the prey to escape. \nTonic immobility may also serve to reduce the amount of pain and \nsuffering the prey may experience.  The chemicals released during tonic \nimmobility may dull the senses lessening the experience ofphysical \n• \nexperience ofpain as well as distorting the cognitive functions such as \n60 \n\n• \nmemory, a physiological attempt to lessen emotional pain. Research \nindicates that 12-50% of rape victims experience tonic immobility.  This \nresponse has critical implications for the prosecution of sexual assault cases \n- as it is an oft-repeated question to the sexual assault survivor: \"why didn't \nyou scream/fight back?\"  The answer may lay in part in the fact that many \nphysically cannot. \nTrauma and Memory \nThe nature of the neurobiological response to a traumatic event also \nimpairs the normal process for encoding ofmemories.  This can affect a \n• \n\nvictim's memory immediately after the assault as well as over the long-term. \nFor example, the event may be remembered over a period of days, weeks, \nmonths or even in some cases years.  Also the chronology ofthe event may \nbe disrupted so that it is difficult for a victim to give a clear, linear story. \nParts ofthe event may be remembered in vivid detail, while other aspects of \nthe event that may seem important or memorable to others are not \nremembered at all by the victim.  For example, a victim may remember the \nsmell of garlic on the offender's breath with nauseating detail, but not be \nable to recall how he removed her pants.  However, victim-centered \n•  techniques such as the FETI interview can assist in retrieving memories . \n61 \n\n•\nRecovery from the Trauma ofSexual Assault \nRecovery from sexual assault begins immediately after the assault \noccurs and continues for days, weeks, months and years after the assault. \nResearch shows that the initial responses a victim receives when she \ndiscloses the assault affect the trajectory of her recovery. A victim who is \nbelieved, supported and encouraged to regain a sense of control may move \nmore quickly to the later stages than victims who are met with disbelief or \ncriticism. \n'A victim who i9;/Jel;~ed,. supporteda~4 \nMany survivors who  encouragedto reg4~~\";(lsense; ofcon~~~ \nmaJ!;;move  more  q,lIi~~ly  to. the<l~t~t \nengage in the criminal justice  • \ni$t(J;j~s,:(J1 recovery tha~;~ictims wh(J; lIre. \nv  ~\"  ',\" •.;' \",  \",'  •  c,  \"',, A'  ;. \n. or \ndi$beli~f criticisin~\nsystem experience re­\nvictimization.  Even if a victim is met with uniform support and a victim-\ncentered response from sensitive and understanding law enforcement and \nprosecutors, the criminal justice process is designed to \"prove or disprove\" \nher experience.  This requires repeated retelling of the story, and facing \nthose seeking to undermine the victim's credibility, including the offender \nand his counsel. Often it involves many procedures, interactions and \nsituations that the survivor is unable to control. \n• \n62 \n\n• \nAdditionally, neurologic responses to trauma may cause a victim to \nrespond to certain stimuli related to the assault as if it were occurring again. \nThese \"triggers\" are unconscious and often connected to the senses; for \nexample, the sound ofthe assailant's voice or the smell ofhis aftershave. \nThis has major implications for victims of sexual assault who are going \nthrough the criminal justice system. Dr. David Lisak states that \"to \nparticipate in that process - to endlessly recount their trauma, to appear in \nthe court room where the offender sits - is equivalent to the zebra choosing \nto return to the water hole where the lion attacked.\" This analogy speaks \n• \n volumes about how important it is to institute a victim-centered response \nthat has as a main part of its focus the minimization of retraumatization by \nthe criminal justice system. \nIn working with victims in the criminal justice system, it is important \nto understand the stages of \n'rlilpartii/batecin the pro,fe.5s \":'/0  ','  \" \n\ntrauma and recovery.  The  l \n~::c:!;~~::~~:;j~ \n\nstage the survivor is \n~quil)alenttlJ't~t\"  :. a cltoosiHRlJi~~t~rn to \nexperiencing will affect her  the ~(!tltr h~lew/t;~~l!;;;thel~~!!:,«h .ke\"'!  '\nthoughts, emotions, and \nbehavior. It may also manifest in physical symptoms or reactions . \n• \n63 \n\n• \nStages ofTrauma and Recovery \nThe following stages of trauma and recovery are generalizations. Each \nvictim has her own path and process. Some may never experience certain \nstages or symptoms, some may fluctuate between stages, and some may \nbecome stuck in a particular stage. \nPre-Impact Terror \nThis stage occurs during the very frightening moments just prior to \nthe assault itself, when the victim knows, without a doubt, what will happen \nbut is powerless to stop it. In other words, trauma does not start after the  • \nassault; it starts before it. The concept ofpre-impact terror has been used to \ndescribe the pain and suffering (beyond loss of life or limb) of airplane \npassengers who know the plane is going to crash. \nInitial Crisis or Acute Stage of Trauma \nThe acute phase of trauma occurs immediately after the event and \noften lasts a few days or weeks, but could also last only a few minutes or a \nfew hours.  The initial reaction following a sexual assault can take on many \n• \nforms. As described above, a victim may experience emotional as well as \n64 \n\n• \nphysical shock such as feeling weak, nauseated, moving slowly, nightmares, \nand insomnia.  During this phase the victim may appear withdrawn -- having \nflat affect, being unresponsive or appearing confused.  The victim may also \nbe highly expressive, including crying, screaming or shaking.  Or, she may \nvacillate between many presentations. \nWorking with victims in this stage may be difficult due to the intense \nnature ofthe emotional reactions - whether the victim is withdrawn and \nunresponsive or highly expressive.  Memories ofthe event may come in \npieces during this \n• \n The  victi~',,)ntiy,H  ',express,i# ' \ntime, and new  includi  lYing, <$~re'fzhJ'  \"(Jr';~llking~'< \n\ni \nmaY~~fill~~f:\\,b~~eel!:fJJartYp~~!!ntd~~\",$~\n\nsJU! \nmemories may bring \nanother wave of intense emotional and physical reactions.  Victims in this \nphase may be emotionally and physically exhausted by simple tasks of daily \nliving, and have difficulty engaging in discussion about the event. \nOutward Adjustment \nOnce a victim has moved through the initial crisis, she often moves \ninto Outward Adjustment. In this stage, the victim returns to her normal \nroutine, wanting to forget about the assault. Often well-intentioned family \n• \nmembers, friends, or significant others encourage this \"moving on.\"  While \n65 \n\n• \nin this phase, victims may attempt to make sense out of the crime, or block \nthe experience out of memory.  This can be an important and self-protective \ncoping mechanism for the short term. Victims focus most of their emotional \nenergy attempting to resume their day-to-day activities. This stage may last \nweeks, months or years. \nVictims in this stage may be very reluctant to talk about the assault or \nto engage in any activity that is a reminder of the event.  If a victim reports \nan assault during the initial crisis, she often will enter into this second stage \nduring the criminal justice process.  This may mean a victim who appeared \n• \nvery interested and cooperative with police during the initial phase may \nbecome reluctant, withdrawn or combative during the Outward Adjustment \nphase.  This is due to the normal healing process, and is not indicative ofthe \nveracity of the report, or the victim's  welT \nA  victim  ma~,\" be', \ninterested,  an{I<~o{}jJ~i~tJv~ \nmental health.

Feelings of depression, anxiety and shame increase. Also the \nvictim may experience intense anger as she moves through this stage. Other \nsymptoms can include nightmares, flashbacks, a sense ofvulnerability, \nmistrust and physical complaints. When a victim seeks help at this stage, it \n• \ncan confuse family and friends who thought that their loved one had fully \nrecovered. \nVictims are more likely to seek out help and the criminal justice \nsystem in this stage than in the previous outward adjustment stage.  The \nanger that surfaces during this stage may fuel a desire for justice, and be an \nimportant part ofthe victim's healing. \nIntegration \nThe integration phase may be the most challenging. One day, a victim \n•  may announce her recovery. Another day, she may fear that she will never \n67 \n\n• \nbe what she considers to be nonnal again. Eventually, most victims' \n\nintrusive memories and emotional tunnoillessen. The victim may still spend \n\ntime thinking about and talking about the assault, but finds that when \ntriggers and flashbacks do occur, the feelings surrounding the experience are \nabbreviated and less intense. The sexual assault is integrated into a victim's \nlife as a significant life event among many others. \nMost prosecutors will not see victims in this stage, as it usually takes \ntime, sometimes years, to reach.  Some victims never do.  However, a victim \nin this stage will be more able to identify her needs and boundaries related to \n• \nthe assault and an ongoing court case, ifthere is one.  She may be more \naware ofher triggers and able to predict her reactions.  She may still have \nintense responses to situations that remind her of the assault but should have \nmore resources to cope.  However, it is possible that if her coping is \noverwhelmed she could return to an earlier stage, for example the stress of a \ncourt case may bring up anxiety, anger, nightmares, and flashbacks. She may \nreturn to previous coping strategies, helpful or unhelpful, that she had used \nin the past. \n• \n68 \n\n• \t\nChapter 4 \nRAPE MYTHS AND THE REALITIES OF \nOFFENDERS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT38 \nThe term \"rape myth\" applies to beliefs about offenders and their \nbehaviors as well as to victims. There are many myths and misconceptions \nabout sexual assault and about those who perpetrate sexual assault.  Many \npeople mistakenly believe that \"real\" offenders: \n• \t Are strangers to their victims and select their victims randomly; \n•  •  Stalk and attack the victims at night in dark but public places, or break \ninto the victims' homes and attack them there; \n• \t Use weapons and violence to perpetrate their assaults, leaving victims \nwith obvious physical injuries; \n• \t Look like offenders, i.e. mean, thug-like, or weird and scary; and \n• \t Don't have consensual sex partners and are driven to rape by unmet \nsexual needs, or that offenders have abnormal sexual needs that they \ncan only meet through raping non-consenting victims. \nThese myths are believed for a variety of reasons.  The stereotype of \nthe \"typical offender\" gives potential victims a sense of security.  If you can \nfigure out who the likely offenders are based on their appearance, and if you \n• \n38 A substantial portion of this chapter has been reprinted with pennission from the Michigan Domestic and Sexual \nViolence Prevention and Treatment Board and the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan.

In reality, the great majority of sexual \nassaults are perpetrated by someone known to the victim. \nIn part as a result of these erroneous yet widely held beliefs, when a \nvictim reports having been raped by a friend, co-worker, or someone she met \nin a social setting, the report is likely to be viewed with more suspicion by \nlaw enforcement and less likely to be charged by prosecutors.  People often \nrefer to non-stranger sexual assault as \"date rape,\" perceive it as having \nresulted from a \"miscommunication\" or \"misunderstanding\" between the \noffender and the victim, and believe it is somehow less serious than \"real\" \n• \n\nrape. Nothing could be further from the truth . \nHowever, there is no profile of a typical offender. Their personalities and \ncharacteristics are far too diverse. Research has emerged that sheds light on \noffenders of non-stranger sexual assault that sharply contradicts stereotypes \nabout non-stranger rapes as being misunderstandings, miscommunications, \nor the result of too much alcohol. \nOffenders ofNon-Stranger Sexual Assault Tend to Be Serial Criminal \nOffenders \nUntil fairly recently, the great majority of research looking at sexual \noffenders was drawn from studies of convicted and incarcerated offenders . \n• \n71 \n\nThese were the \"detected\" offenders, the ones who were pursued and caught.  • \nSignificantly, their crimes were more likely to have been reported and \nprosecuted because violence and weapons were used, because there was \ninjury, and/or because the offender targeted a stranger. \nIt has been known for some time that a significant percentage of \noffenders who have been caught are serial offenders.  In studies in which \nconvicted offenders were assured of confidentiality and asked to self-report \nabout other sexual assaults and crimes, a significant number disclosed that \nthey had committed many more offenses, and against more victims, than \n• \nthose offenses for which they had been convicted.  In one study, 127 \noffenders admitted to 907 paraphilic acts against 882 victims. In another \nstudy, 37 men in a sex offender treatment program had been charged with 66 \noffenses against a mean of 1.8 victims.  However, in confidential self-\nreporting, the 37 offenders admitted to 433 rapes against a mean of 11.7 \nvictims. \nIn the last 10-15 years, however, some researchers began looking at \nthe population ofundetected offenders and asking how those offenders \nmight be similar to, or different from, the offenders who had been caught. \nThis was an important question, given the numbers of cases that go  • \n72 \n\n• \nunreported. Because most research focused on convicted or incarcerated \noffenders, there was a huge population ofundetected sexual offenders about \nwhom little was known. \nAs it turned out, a substantial number of undetected sex offenders are \nalso serial criminals.  Dr. David Lisak, associate professor ofpsychology \nand researcher at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, conducted a \ncomprehensive research project examining these \"undetected rapists\" to \ndetermine whether they were similar to their convicted counterparts in terms \nof engaging in multiple sexual assaults and other crimes. The offenders \n• \n\nidentified in the study were not asked ifthey had committed various forms \nof sexual assault. They were given a survey on life experiences, including \nsexual experiences. They were asked ifthey had ever 1) tried to have sexual \nintercourse by using or threatening to use physical force (twisting her arm, \nholding them down, etc. ifthey did not cooperate; 2) had sexual intercourse \nwith someone, even though they did not want to, because they were too \nintoxicated to resist; 3) had sexual intercourse with an adult who didn't want \nto by using or threatening to use physical force; or 4) had oral sex with and \nadult who didn't want to by using or threatening to use physical force . \n• \n73 \n\nDr. Lisak's research showed that 120 (6.4%) ofthe men in the study  • \nhad committed rape or attempted rape while in college, and those crimes had \nnever been reported.  76 ofthese men (63%) reported committing repeated \nrapes, against multiple victims and/or against the same victims. These 120 \nundetected offenders were responsible for a total of483 rapes; the 76 repeat \noffenders averaged 5.8 rapes each. \nThese undetected offenders also acknowledged committing other \ncrimes, including sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, physical or \nsexual abuse of children, and physical assaults against intimate partners. \n• \nIncluding the 483 admitted rapes, these 120 men committed a total of 1225 \nacts of interpersonal violence.  Like those offenders who have been caught \nand convicted, the majority ofundetected sexual offenders are one-man \ncrime sprees who present a serious risk ofharm to many different victims. \nLisak's findings were replicated in a study of 1146 male Navy \nrecruits.  In that study it was found that 13% had committed sexual offenses, \nand 71 % ofthose were serial offenders who admitted to an average of 6 \nrapes per offender.  Ofthe total 865 rapes admitted to, 95% ofthem were \ncommitted by the serial offenders. Dr. Lisak's research has also been \nduplicated in other studies, with similar results.  • \n74 \n\n• \nOffenders ofNon-Stranger Sexual Assault Seek To Create or Exploit \nVictim  Vulnerability, Accessibility, and Lack ofCredibility \nIt is now becoming more widely understood that offenders ofnon-\nstranger sexual assault deliberately target victims who: \n•  Are vulnerable, or can be made so; \n•  Are accessible, or can be made so; and/or \n•  Are lacking in credibility, or can be made so. \nWhen people think of sexual assault by strangers, it is not hard for \nthem to perceive how stranger offenders take advantage of victims who are \nvulnerable and accessible. The stranger in a car who pulls up next to an \nadolescent girl walking alone to school in an urban area and asks for \n• \ndirections, then pulls her into the car and \ndrives away; the two men who wait in an \nunlighted area of a mall parking lot late at \nnight and sexual assaults the woman who \nwalks to her car after her shift - these are \neasily seen as acts that take advantage of \nsomeone who is vulnerable and accessible.  After all, these offenders didn't \ngo into the school or the crowded mall where they could be seen or stopped. \nIt has been harder for people to recognize that offenders of non-\n• \nstranger sexual assault also engage in selective and predatory behavior with \n75 \n\n• \ntheir victims. The undetected offenders in Lisak's research provide a \nstrikingly clear example of this strategic behavior.  The majority of those \noffenders: \n• \t Knew their victims, at least casually; \n• \t Were proficient at identifying potential victims; \n• \t Tested victims' boundaries for vulnerability and ease of access; \n• \t U sed physical force or violence only instrumentally and \nstrategically, and only as much as was required in order to \nfrighten or intimidate the victim into submission; \n• \t Used psychological strategy (cunning, control, manipulation, \nand threats) to accomplish the sexual assault, with physical \nforce only as a backup; \n• \t Almost never resorted to use of weapons; \n• \t Used alcohol deliberately to render victims more vulnerable or \ncompletely unconscious;  • \n• \t Isolated the victim using manipulation. \nSexual offenders target someone who is already vulnerable and then \ntest that victim's boundaries.  For example, a predator will look for someone \nwho is already drinking a lot, or who is already in a situation where the \nvictim is socially off  Off(mdefr~ffjJlnOfl:,*st~tl)iger.s.uiJ!;lINsault . \nalso·· ~f1Il~ge' i~~;'~elective:'a,;iJd  .....• tory \nbalance or nervous.  The  bihavfuf\".wit,.tlu~lFvi'ttil1js;,.  ' \"'~\\t\\L··  . \noffender will test to see how vulnerable that potential victim is.  He may \napproach and invade that victim's personal space - sitting or standing too \n• \nclose, putting an arm around her, to gauge whether she demonstrates a \n76 \n\n• \ncapacity to resist that small violation ofpersonal boundaries.  The offender \nwill ignore a request to be left alone to see if doing so overcomes the \nvictim's expression of her personal wishes.  Ifit does, the offender has \nidentified a potential vulnerable victim. \nThen, the offender seeks to enhance that vulnerability.  He may draw \nthe victim away from her friends, give her alcohol and encourage her to \ndrink.  He may act overly solicitous, and play the \"white knight\" who offers \nto help the victim get home. \nThe manner in which non-stranger offenders create or exploit victim \n• \nvulnerability, accessibility, and credibility is nowhere more clearly \ndemonstrated than in the video-recorded re-enactment of one ofDr. Lisak's \nresearch interviews with a male pre-law college student referred to as \n\"Frank.,,40 The student recounts in his interview how he and his fraternity \nbrothers would \"scout\" the campus for \"easy prey.\"  He and his fraternity \nbrothers would prepare a sweet punch laced with alcohol and serve these \ndrinks to their \"targets.\"  When the alcohol clearly was affecting the women, \n40 The \"Frank\" video is available from the National Judicial Education Program, \nbttps:1I www.legalmomentum.org/store/undetected-rapist-dvd \n• \n77 \n\n• \nFrank and his fraternity brothers would \"make [their] move\" and take their \nspecifically invited guests to the rooms prepared for the assault. \nIn the video, Frank explains how he took his targeted guest up to this \nspecial room.  He noticed that she was \"really woozy,\" so he brought her \nanother drink.  Then he \"leaned her down on the bed,\" and began working \nher clothes off even as she told him she didn't want to do this.  When she \n\"squirmed\" underneath him and tried to resist, Frank pushed her down and \nput his arm across the woman's upper chest and neck.  She stopped \nsquirming, and Frank raped her. \n• \nUse ofAlcohol by Sexual Offenders \n\"Frank\" and his fraternity brothers are not unique in their use of alcohol \nto create vulnerable victims.  In Dr. Lisak's research, 80.8% of the \nundetected offenders reported that they raped women who were \nincapacitated because of drugs or alcohol.  Other studies have confirmed that \nalcohol is used as a tool -- and voluntary intoxication is used as an \nopportunity -- by those who perpetrate sexual assault.  In one study of \ncollege men: \n•  15% acknowledged using some form of alcohol-related sexual \n• \ncoerCIOn; \n78 \n\n• \n•  35% reported that their friends approved of getting a woman \ndrunk to have sex with her; \n• \t 20% acknowledged having \n\nfriends who had gotten a \n\nwoman drunk or high to have \n\nsex. \n\nSexual assault offenders need not \npurposely ply their victims with alcohol, \nalthough some do.  An offender may target \na victim who has voluntarily consumed \nalcohol and is intoxicated.  An intoxicated woman is more vulnerable than a \n• \n sober one, due to the effects ofthe alcohol on cognitive functioning and \nmotor skills. \nOffenders also may target an intoxicated victim because those victims \ncan more easily be made accessible and isolated by the offender.  The \noffender may use the pretext of \"helping\" her by walking her to her dorm \nroom or driving her home, where he can assault her without fear of \ndiscovery or intervention. \nFinally, societal perceptions about intoxicated women can make the \nvictim appear less credible when she reports the assault and the offender \n•  claims she consented.  Offenders understand these perceptions and take \n79 \n\nadvantage ofthem.  Experiments conducted among sober college students  • \nrevealed that participants perceived women who consumed a few alcoholic \ndrinks as behaving more sexually and more interested in having sex than \nwomen who had consumed only non-alcoholic beverages, despite the fact \nthat the description of the women's actual behavior was the same. \nAlcohol consumption can make anyone more vulnerable, more \naccessible, and less credible. But alcohol consumption does not by itself \ncreate the risk of victimization. For example, a person can be extremely \ndrunk with friends who are not sexual predators and be in absolutely no \n• \ndanger. It is the presence of an offender willing to exploit the vulnerability \ncreated by intoxication that creates the danger.  Just as a gazelle may drink at \na watering hole without harm ifthere are no lions waiting to pounce, any \nperson may safely drink alcohol, even to the point of intoxication, if there is \nno sexual predator waiting to take advantage. \nOne of the reasons why society perceives reports of non-stranger \nsexual assault with doubt or as somehow less serious is because the \noffenders ofthese assaults do not fit the stereotype of the stranger offender. \nNon-stranger sex offenders can be the neighbor, the co-worker, the high \nschool star athlete, or someone's intimate partner.  It is important to  • \n80 \n\n• \nremember that the typical non-stranger sex offender would not seem at all \nfrightening or intimidating to others, including to his victim, in his day-to­\nday interactions.  Like everyone else, he is adept at showing the world only \nhis \"first persona.\"  Dr. Russell Strand ofthe United States Army Military \nPolice School, notes that \"[ e ]veryone has three personas. The first persona is \nthe one we show most people or acquaintances. We show our second \nr-----------_ \npersona to people we trust not to judge us, such \n'~enaperson is \n\nas our family and close friends. The third \na~aaultedby'somelme \nshe knows, she. \npersona we usually keep to ourselves; this \nlonger knows: wh'O' \n• \n rea{ly i~) or wJ,at  persona is the part of us that we feel most \nc  'do'\nWlli:l,cll cti}. \npeople wouldn't accept about us.\" \nPeople want to believe that they can \ntruly know a person, but the third persona \nremains hidden from us until the actor chooses \nreveal it. \"[W]hether our third persona is \nharmless or not, a wicked trick of the mind is that we almost always fail to \nrecognize that it exists in others. We assume, tragically at times, that we can \nfully know people around us because ofthe personas they reveal to us. We \ntell ourselves that we can sense, we can see, we can discern.\" \n• \n81 \n\n•\nIt is vital that prosecutors recognize this phenomenon.  Friends, \nfamily, and acquaintances ofthe offender will jump to the offender's \ndefense, because he has never seemed to them like anyone who could \npossibly sexually assault another person.  That is because they have never \nseen that third persona, they may have only ever seen the person he has \npresented to the world at large.  The jury may not understand, for example, \nhow this man could be a sex offender when the victim has known this \nperson, gone to the movies with him, or hung out with him and their group \nof friends several times.  That is because, unless the prosecutor addresses it, \nthey will not understand the ways in which offenders can mask their true  • \nselves from others.  The jury may not understand why the victim did not \nphysically resist, or may not believe the victim if she testifies that she was \nafraid the offender was going to kill her.  After all, the offender was \nsomeone the victim knew and never threatened to hurt her during the assault. \nIt is imperative that we help the jury understand that there is a \"third \npersona\" that the non-stranger sexual offender reveals to his victim when he \nmakes clear that the sexual contact is going to happen whether or not she \nconsents.  At that moment, he becomes a stranger, someone she doesn't \nknow, because she never thought that the person she knew would do this to \n• \n82 \n\n• \nher.

The victim no longer has any \nfoundation for predicting the offender's propensity for violence - she no \nlonger knows who he really is or what he is willing to do if she resists. \nThis more recent research has led to a greater understanding of \noffenders. The research \"conflicts sharply with the widely-held view that \n• \n\nsexual assaults .... are typically the result of a basically 'decent' young man \nwho, were it not for too much alcohol and too little communication, would \nnever do such a thing. While some ...assaults do fit this more benign view, \nthe evidence points to a far more sinister reality, in which the vast majority \nof sexual assaults are committed by serial, violent predators.,,41  In fact, this \nresearch has led to the term \"date rape\" being viewed with disfavor, the \ncriticism being that the connotation associated with \"date rape\" is that \n• \n14,  4 \n41 Understanding the Predatory Nature of Sexual Violence, David Lisak, Sexual Assault Report, Volume  no. \nMarchiApril2011 \n83 \n\n• \nvictims suffer less harm, and \"date offenders\" are less serious offenders, \nthan stranger offenders. \nAll of these things conspire to normalize sexual assault, or to disguise \nit as something consensual.  Sexual assault is excused as \"hooking up,\" \n\"one-night stand,\" or drunk sex that the victim later regrets.  Offenders count \non the jury thinking that, at worst, this was sex gone wrong or a \nmisunderstanding. The prosecutor's job is to remove the disguise and \nrecreate the reality ofwhat happened. \nWhen police receive a report of a non-stranger sexual assault, there is \n•\na high likelihood that the suspect is a serial offender.  Accordingly, the \ninvestigation and case development should be as rigorous and thorough as \nthe investigation and prosecution of any other crime where there is reason to \nbelieve that the offense is not likely the first offense. Instead ofviewing the \nreport with skepticism and scrutinizing the victim and her behavior, law \nenforcement and prosecutors need to engage in an offender-focused \ninvestigation and prosecution, with the current research on offenders firmly \nin mind. \n• \n84 \n\n• \nChapter 5 \nMONTANA SEXUAL ASSAULT STATUTES \nMontana's core criminal statutes prohibiting various types ofnon-\nconsensual sexual contact are contained in Title 45, Part 5 of the Montana \nCode Annotated and include Sexual Assault, Sexual Intercourse without \nConsent (SIWOC), Indecent Exposure and Incest.  Ofthese, Sexual Assault \nand SIWOC will be the focus of this chapter since they are most often the \nstatutes at issue in non-stranger sexual assault cases.  There are, however, \nother sexually related criminal statutes that may occasionally be of \n• \nconsideration in a case involving sexual conduct including the crimes \nentitled \"Offenses Against the Family,\" which are found in Title 45, Part 6. \nThese include the human trafficking related offenses of promoting \nprostitution and the child pornography focused offense of sexual abuse of \nchildren. \nThe statutory definitions and case law applicable to the crimes of \nSexual Assault and SIWOC are sufficiently distinct that separately \nconsidering these topics lends itself to less confusion.  Accordingly, this \nChapter will first address the elements and critical definitions relating to \n• \nSIWOC, followed by a separate discussion elements and critical definitions \n85 \n\n• \nrelated to Sexual Assault. This will be followed by a discussion of statutes \ngenerally related to sex crime prosecutions, including statutory provisions on \nevidence in sex cases, and statutory jury instructions on sex cases, and a \nbasic discussion of Montana's rape shield statute. \nSexual Intercourse Without Consent \nMontana Code Annotated § 45-5-503 provides that \"[a] person who \nknowingly has sexual intercourse without consent with another person \ncommits the offense of sexual intercourse without consent.\"  Montana's \nStandard Criminal Jury instruction requires that the State prove the \n• \n\nfollowing elements, beyond a reasonable doubt to convict on this crime: \n1.  The Defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim; \nAND \n2.  The act of sexual intercourse was without the consent of the \nvictim; \nAND \n3.  The Defendant acted knowingly. \n• \n86 \n\n• \nThe elements of\"sexual intercourse\" and \"without consent\" are \ndefined by statute, and each will be discussed in tum. \nSexual Intercourse \n\"Sexual intercourse\" is defined at Mont. Code Ann. § 45-2­\nlOl(68)(a): \n\"Sexual intercourse\" means penetration of the vulva, anus, or \nmouth of one person by the penis of another person, penetration \nofthe vulva or anus of one person by a body member of another \nperson, or penetration ofthe vulva or anus of one person by a \nforeign instrument or object manipulated by another person to \nknowingly or purposely (i) cause bodily injury or humiliate, \n• \n harass, or degrade; or (ii) arouse or gratify the sexual response \nor desire of either party. \nFurthermore, sexual intercourse includes \"any penetration, however slight.\" \nMont. Code Ann. § 45-2-101 (68)(b). \nIt is important to remember, however, that the State must present \naffirmative evidence ofpenetration by the Defendant in order to secure a \nconviction.  For example, it is insufficient \nIn tiSexuallnt(ircQRr~ei'~ \nwhen the only evidence ofpenetration is the  Without Consent ca$e,  ~l \na'tijpenetradQP, howevef)! \nfemale victim stating that \"he was performing  [ii/lght, isisuJii~ientfor a .. \n. \nchl!~g,~;i  ·~;;r;,·. \noral sex on me\" and that \"I was lying down \n•  and he had his arms over my legs and his head between my legs.\" State v. \n87 \n\n• \n\nLundblade, 221 Mont. 185, 187-88, \n:Che'diiftnititinioi~'without~jii>:: \n717 P.2d 575 (1986).  The Lundblade  c~ns:;Utf!'J(}litu/Jn MC:PlJ'45~ \n\"e;:,  .\"  '. \n5:t5f11 applieS\" only to \ncourt held that the prosecutor needed to  oJlJnse ojSe.,\"tual Iltt~fc~urse \nwithout Consent. \nelicit specific evidence from the victim \nestablishing that her vulva was penetrated, assuming that was the case, in \norder to prove this element beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id. \nWithout Consent \n\"Without consent\" is defined at Montana Code Ann. § 45-5-501.  This \ndefinition only applies to use ofthe term in \n• \n\nf'Without(jaIi8ent!~:'; ..' \nJnciuf{~sjdl'Jer ....... ,  SIWOC cases.  For purposes this manual, this \ndecejJ#iJ/i\" coercion~ \nstatute is divided into three categories of \n's\"\". \"lJ\"'.n(, r;.rl s\"e. , p h  ·p.I\"i':J'~.+:\ny~~\"..(l~\"~'i,~~::{f:>~ \nh~iPlessnes~~;:\"eftt~i.'.

Code Ann. § 45-5-5-1(I)(a)(i). \n\"Force\" is defined as: \n(a) the infliction, attempted infliction, or threatened infliction of \nbodily injury or the commission of a forcible felony by the \noffender; or (b) the threat of substantial retaliatory action that \ncauses the victim to reasonably believe that the offender has the \nability to execute the threat. \nMont. Code Ann. § 45-5-5-1 (2). \nThe Montana Supreme Court has strictly construed this statutory \ndefinition of\"force.\"  In State v. Haser, the State argued a theory of \n\"constructive force\" when the Defendant suddenly and without warning, \n• \ndigitally penetrated the vulva ofwomen he was supposed to be \nphotographing.  State v. Haser, 2001 MT 6, ,-r 43,304 Mont. 63,20 P.3d \n100.  The court rejected this theory, pointing to \"Montana's clear legislative \nmandate  'force' must be related somehow to bodily injury, the \ntha~ \nattempted infliction of bodily injury, or an actual threat of some kind.\"  Id. at \nIn the wake ofthis decision, the Montana legislature filled this gap by \ndefining a person as incapable of consent who is \"overcome by deception, \ncoercion, or surprise.\"  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-501(I)(a) (ii)(C) (effective \n• \nOctober 1, 2001).  While this provision is apparently meant to at least \n89 \n\nencompass someone who is digitally penetrated without prior warning in a  • \nmassage or photography session, this language could also be more broadly \napplied to non-stranger assault situations where the deception or coercion \ntakes place through the use of isolation or other common techniques. \nThe meaning ofpart Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-5-1(2) (b) also is best \ndefined by reference to the Montana Supreme Court case that prompted its \npassage. In State v.  Thompson, a teacher threatened a high school student \nwith non-graduation if she refused to perform oral sex.  State v. Thompson, \n243 Mont. 28, 29, 792 P2d 1103,47 St. Rep. 1065 (1990). \nThe State charged SIWOC based on the theory that the high school  • \nprincipal had \"in his position of authority as the principal, intimidated Jane \nDoe into the alleged acts.\"  Id. at 32.  The State argued \"the fear and \napprehension of Jane Doe show [that the school principal] used force against \nher.\" Id.  The statutory definition of \"force\" in effect at the time of these \nevents, however, was limited to situations where \"the victim is compelled to \nsubmit by force or by threat of imminent death, bodily injury, or kidnapping \nto be inflicted on anyone.\"  Id. at 31.  The district court granted a motion to \ndismiss because no \"force\" was alleged in the charging document.  Id. at 31 . \n• \n90 \n\n• \nThe Montana Supreme Court reluctantly affirmed, finding that the facts did \nnot fit within the definition of\"force\" in effect at the time.  Id. at 33. \nIn the wake of this decision, the Legislature passed part (b), which \ndefines force as \"the threat of substantial retaliatory action that causes the \nvictim to reasonably believe that the offender has the ability to execute the \nthreat.\"  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-501(2)(b) (effective April 27, 1991). \nThe victim is incapable of consent because ofphysical or mental \ndisability: \n\"Without consent\" includes a victim who is incapable of consent \n• \n because she is \"mentally defective,\" \"mentally incapacitated,\" or \"physically \nhelpless.\"  The term \"mentally defective\" \"means that a person suffers from \na mental disease or defect that renders the person incapable of appreciating \nthe nature ofthe person's own conduct.\"  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-2-101 (40). \nThe Montana Supreme Court has not interpreted this definition directly. \nProof that a victim meets this definition would likely be best addressed with \nexpert testimony after an appropriate examination of the victim. \nThe term \"mentally incapacitated\" means that a person is rendered \ntemporarily incapable of appreciating or controlling the person's own \nconduct as a result ofthe influence of an intoxicating substance.  Mont. Code \n• \n91 \n\n• \nAnn. § 45-2-101 (41).  It makes no difference whether the victim is \nintoxicated voluntarily or involuntarily.  State v.  Gould, 273 Mont. 207, 220, \n902 P.2d 532 (1995).  Where the intoxicating substance at issue is alcohol, \nlay opinion testimony ofeyewitness may be sufficient to prove the victim \nwas \"mentally incapacitated.\"  See generally State v.  Carter, 285 Mont. 449, \n948 P .2d 1173 (holding that lay persons may offer an opinion on \nintoxication). However when drugs or other substances are at issue, proof of \nthis element should be handled with the testimony ofa toxicologist, along \nwith analysis ofthe victim's blood, if available.  See State v. Nobach, 2002 \nMT 91 (holding lay people are not sufficiently knowledgeable about  • \ncommon symptoms ofdrugs to offer lay opinion testimony.) \nThe term \"physically helpless\" means that a person is unconscious or \nis otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act. Mont. \nCode Ann. § 45-2-101 (58).  The Montana Supreme Court has made it clear \nthat a person who is sleeping is \"physically helpless.\" See State v. Stevens, \n2002 MT 181,,-r 44,311 Mont. 52,53 P.2d 356. This remains true regardless \nofwhether the sleep is drug-induced or achieved normally, and even ifthat \nperson had some sensory perception.  Id. at,-r 45. \n• \n92 \n\n• \nThe evidence must establish, however, that the victim was \"physically \nhelpless,\" which includes the state of being asleep, at the time of the sexual \nintercourse.  In State v. Stevens, evidence that the victim \"awoke ... when \nshe felt the sensation of something inside her vagina\" was sufficient to \nsupport a conviction for SIWOC. Stevens, ~~ 11,45.  Evidence that the \nvictim was aware of a sexual assault, but then \"stops breathing,\" becomes \n\"glued to the table\" or is \"frozen out of fear\" at the time ofthe penetration \nwas not sufficient to support SIWOC conviction.  Id. at ~~ 47-49.  The court \nreasoned that this particular victim was not \"physically helpless\" because \n• \n she was \"not sedated and, although frightened\" she had control over her \nbody and therefore was \"conscious and otherwise physically capable of \ncommunicating unwillingness to act.\"  Id. at 49. \nNotably, the Stevens case did not address the issue oftonic \nimmobility.  The Stevens case does not foreclose the possibility that with the \nproper expert testimony a jury may be within its bounds in finding that a \nsober, awake and aware person may in fact be \"physically helpless\" because \nof the effects oftonic immobility. \nThe victim is incapable of consent due to other circumstances: \n• \n93 \n\nFinally, Montana Law provides a list of circumstances under which  • \nthe victim is incapable of consent to sexual intercourse.  See 45-5-501(1)(a)­\n( c).  These circumstances are generally described as: \n• \t The victim is overcome by deception, coercion or surprise, as \ndescribed above; \n• \t The victim is under 16 years of age; \n• \t The victim is incarcerated in an adult or juvenile correctional, \ndetention, or treatment facility or is on probation or parole and \nthe offender is an employee, contractor, or volunteer of the \nsupervising authority and has supervisory or disciplinary \nauthority over the victim, unless the act is part of a lawful \nsearch;  •\n• \t The victim is admitted to a mental health facility, a community­\nbased facility or a residential facility, or is receiving \ncommunity-based services, as those terms are defined by \nstatute; and the offender has supervisory or disciplinary \nauthority over the victim or is providing treatment to the victim; \nand is an employee, contractor, or volunteer ofthe facility or \ncommunity-based service. \nSentencing in Sexual Intercourse Without Consent \nAny person convicted of a SIWOC will face up to life imprisonment. \nMont. Code Ann. § 45-5-502.  The statute provides for a mandatory \nminimum of \"not less than 2 years\" in a state prison.  This means that the \n• \ndefendant must be sentenced to a minimum of two years in either the \n94 \n\n• \nMontana State Prison or a commitment to the Department of Corrections. \nHowever, the court can reduce this to a minimum oftwo years deferred \nexecution of sentence, pursuant to  Mont. Code Ann. § 46-18-205(2), if the \nCourt finds one of the following exceptions applies: \n(1)  the offender was less than 18 years of age at the time of the \ncommission ofthe offense for which the offender is to be sentenced; \n(2)  the offender's mental capacity, at the time of the commission of \nthe offense for which the offender is to be sentenced, was significantly \nimpaired, although not so impaired as to constitute a defense to the \nprosecution. However, a voluntarily induced intoxicated or drugged \ncondition may not be considered impairment for the purposes ofthis \nsubsection. \n• \n (3)  the offender, at the time of the commission ofthe offense for \nwhich the offender is to be sentenced, was acting under unusual and \nsubstantial duress, although not such duress as would constitute a defense to \nthe prosecution; \n(4)  the offender was an accomplice, the conduct constituting the \noffense was principally the conduct of another, and the offender's \nparticipation was relatively minor; \n(5)  in a case in which the threat ofbodily injury or actual infliction of \nbodily injury is an actual element of the crime, no serious bodily injury was \ninflicted on the victim unless a weapon was used in the commission of the \noffense; or \n(6)  the offense was committed under 45-5-310,45-5-311,45-5­\n502(3),45-5-503(4),45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-602(3), 45-5-603(2)(b), \nor 45-5-625(4) and the judge determines, based on the findings contained in \na sexual offender evaluation report prepared by a qualified sexual offender \nevaluator pursuant to the provisions of 46-23-509, that treatment ofthe \noffender while incarcerated, while in a residential treatment facility, or while \nin a local community affords a better opportunity for rehabilitation of the \n• \noffender and for the ultimate protection ofthe victim and society, in which \n95 \n\ncase the judge shall include in its judgment a statement of the reasons for its  • \ndetermination. \nMont. Code Ann. § 46-18-222. \nWith regard to subsection (5), the Montana Supreme Court has held \nthat because \"the threat or infliction of actual bodily harm may, depending \non the circumstances, be an element of the offense of sexual intercourse \nwithout consent, it is reasonable to conclude that the exception to the \nminimum sentence found at § 46-18-222(5), MCA, when no \"serious bodily \ninjury was inflicted on the victim\" is applicable to that offense. State v. \nGoodwin, 249 M 1,813 P2d 953, 48 St. Rep. 539 (1991).  Accordingly, \nwhere the victim has not suffered at least the threat of \"bodily injury,\" this  • \nfinding is appropriate, and the court's discretion is only limited by a \nmandatory minimum of a two-year deferred imposition of sentence.  See \nMont. Code Ann. § 46-18-205 (where restricting deferrals or execution of \nsentence based on age of victim implies that a deferral or suspension of \nsentence is otherwise appropriate). \nThe mandatory minimum sentence becomes increasingly severe based \non the age of the victim and the relative age ofthe Defendant.  If the victim \nis under 16, the first 30 days ofthe sentence may not be deferred or \n• \nsuspended. Mont. Code Ann. § 46-18-205(1).  This means that the minimum \n96 \n\n• \nsentence would be a two-year sentence to a state prison with all but 30 days \nsuspended. If the victim is under 16 and the offender is four or more years \nolder than the victim, then the minimum would be four years with all but 30 \ndays suspended.  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-503(3)(a); Id.  If the victim is 12 \nor younger and the Defendant is 18 or older at the time ofthe offense, the \nDefendant will be subject to a mandatory life sentence with 25 years ofno \nparole, unless the Court finds one ofthe exceptions described in Mont Code \nAnn. § 45-18-222, as described above.  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-503(4)(a). \nFinally, the Defendant must be sentenced to life without release ifhe \n• \n\nhas previously been convicted of one ofthe following qualifying offenses: \ndeliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, sexual intercourse without \nconsent, sexual abuse of children, and ritual abuse of a minor.  Mont. Code \nAnn. § 46-18-219.  The only exception to this minimum is provided at § 45­\n19-219(3).  This language is confusing, and has yet to be directly addressed \nby the Montana Supreme Court.  The likely interpretation would be that the \ncourt may depart from mandatory life without release ifthe court that \npreviously sentenced the defendant for one ofthe qualifying offenses found \nthat a Mont Code Ann. § 45-18-222 exception applied to that offense, and \nsentenced accordingly. \n• \n97 \n\nSexual Assault \nMontana Code Annotated § 45-5-502 provides that \"[a] person who \nknowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent \ncommits the offense of sexual assault.\"  Unlike SIWOC, sexual assault can \nbe charged as a misdemeanor or a felony.  In order to charge and convict as \na felony, the State must allege and prove one or more of the following \ncircumstances: \n• \t The present offense is a third or subsequent offense of sexual \nassault; \n• \t The victim is less than 16 years old and the offender is 3 or \n• \n\nmore years older than the victim; or \n• \t The offender inflicted bodily injury on the victim in the course \nof the sexual assault, regardless ofthe victim's age. \nWith regard to the third circumstance, \"bodily injury\" is defined at § \n45-2-101(5) as \"physical pain, illness, or an impairment ofphysical \ncondition and includes mental illness or impairment.\" \nIn order to convict a Defendant of Sexual Assault, Montana's \nStandard Criminal Jury Instructions require that the State to prove the \nfollowing elements, beyond a reasonable doubt: \n• \nl.  The Defendant subjected the victim to sexual contact; \n98 \n\n• \nAND \n2.  The act of sexual contact was without the consent of the victim; \nAND \n3.  The Defendant acted knowingly. \nThe two critical definitions required to be proved in these elements \nare \"sexual contact\" and \"without consent.\"  Each is addressed here in tum. \nSexual Contact \n• \n \"Sexual contact\" means touching ofthe sexual or other intimate parts \nof the person of another, directly or through clothing, in order to knowingly \nor purposely cause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass, or degrade another; \nor to arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.  Mont. \nCode Ann. § 45-2-101 (67).  The legislative policy underlying this definition \n\"is to criminalize and punish sexual or intimate impositions that do not \ninvolve penetration ... but which express a societal concern for such \nimpositions because they provoke outrage, disgust or shame in the victim.\" \nState v. Kern, 2003 MT 77,,-r 24,315 Mont. 22, 67 P.3d 272. \n• \n99 \n\nApplying this policy, the Montana Supreme Court has determined that  • \n\nthe definition of \"sexual contact\" reaches a broad swath of conduct. \nEssentially any type of intimate contact is sufficient regardless ofwho does \nthe touching or what body part is involved, especially when the victim is \nunder the age of consent.  All ofthe following factual scenarios were \ndeemed to fall within the definition: \n•  An adult male rubbing the belly and chest of a 9-year old girl. State v. \nWeese, 189 Mont. 464,467-68,616 \nP.2d 371,373-74 (1980).

Rogers, 2007 MT 227, ,-r 30,339 Mont. \n132, 168 P.3d 669.  • \n\n100 \n\n• \t\nWithout Consent \nThe term \"without consent\" is not defined for purposes of its use in \nthe crime of sexual assault.  Instead, \"without consent\" retains its ordinary \nmeaning, with a few narrowly defined circumstances where consent is \nineffective. Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-502(5); State v.  Williams, 2010 MT 58, \n,-r 24,355 Mont. 354,228 P.3d 1127.  The circumstances where consent is \nineffective generally include:42 \n• \t Where the victim less than 14 years old and the offender is 3 or more \nyears older than the victim; \n• \n\n• \t Where the victim is incarcerated in an adult or juvenile correctional, \ndetention, or treatment facility or is on probation or parole and the \noffender is an employee, contractor, or volunteer of the supervising \nauthority and has supervisory or disciplinary authority over the victim, \nunless the act is part of a lawful search; \n• \t Where the victim receiving services from a youth care facility, as \ndefined in 52-2-602, and the offender has supervisory or disciplinary \nauthority over the victim or is providing treatment to the victim; and \nis an employee, contractor, or volunteer of the youth care facility; \nWhen sexual assault and SIWOC are charged in the same information, \nthe instructions must clearly distinguish the different definitions of without \nconsent.  For example, the \"without consent\" instruction could state that \"In \n• \n42 Mont. Code Ann 45-5-502. \n101 \n\n• \nregard to Count I, Sexual Assault, the term \"without consent\" retains its \nordinary meaning, In regard to Count II, SIWOC, the term \"term without \nconsent means ....\"  This type of instruction will prevent confusion in cases \nwhere the both sexual assault and sexual intercourse are charged in the same \nInformation. \nThis all begs the question ofwhat is the \"ordinary meaning\" of \n\"without consent.\"  The dictionary definition of \"consent\" is \"to give assent \nor approval.\"  Merriam Webster Dictionary, Online, 2013.  Arguably, this \ndefinition may permit a judge or jury to convict on cases where the victim \n• \nfails to give affirmative consent to sexual contact, which would be broader \nin scope than the definition of \"without consent\" that applies to SIWOC \ncases. \nThe Montana Supreme Court appears to disagree. The court has held, \nin the context of a lesser included offense analysis that the plain meaning of \n\"without consent\" in sexual assault is actually included, and thus narrower in \nscope, than the statutory definition of \"without consent\" used in SIWOC \ncases.  State v.  Williams, 2010 MT 58, ,-r 27, 355 Mont. 354, 228 P.3d 1127. \nThe court reasoned that \"[t]he ordinary meaning of \"without consent\" fits \n• \n102 \n\n• \nsquarely within the definition under § 45-5-501(1)(a)(i), MCA, that \"the \nvictim is compelled to submit by force against the victim or another.\" \nSentencing in Sexual Assault Cases \nA person convicted of felony sexual assault based on the fact that it is \na third conviction is subject to up to five years in prison. Mont. Code Ann. § \n45-5-502(2)( c).  A person convicted of felony sexual assault based on the \nage of the victim being less than 14 or the infliction of bodily injury is \nsubject to up to life in prison. Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-502(3). The \nmandatory minimum when the victim is less than 14 or bodily injury is \n• \n\ninflicted is four years to a state prison with two years suspended. ld.; Mont. \nCode Ann. § 46-18-205(2)(0.  If the judge wishes to suspend less than 4 \nyears, the judge must make a \"written finding that there is good cause.\" \nMont. Code Ann. § 45-5-502.  If the judge wishes to impose less than two \nyears in prison or the Department of Corrections, the jury must make a \nfinding pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. § 46-18-222, as described above in \nsentencing for SIWOC cases. \nKnowledge \nIt is critical to pay close attention to the \"knowingly\" element in sexual \n• \noffense cases. As discussed throughout this manual, offenders take \n103 \n\nadvantage of the stereotypes many people hold in order to commit a sexual  • \nassault. Many defendants claim, and juries often believe, that the sexual act \nwas not an assault, but simply the result of a \"misunderstanding\" or \n\"miscommunication.\" This can make proving a defendant's knowledge more \ndifficult. It is easy for prosecutors to focus primarily on the \"without \nconsent\" element, since that is often the biggest issue in non-stranger sexual \nassault cases; however, the State must prove mental state as to each and \nevery element. Mont. Code Ann. § 45-2-103. Therefore, attention must be \npaid to all indications, large and small, of a defendant's knowledge, starting \nin the investigative stage ofthe case.  • \nLaws Generally Applicable to Sex Crimes \nMontana Code Ann. § 45-5-511 provides a number of miscellaneous \nprovisions that are important to SIWOC and Sexual Assault cases.  First, this \nsection provides the basis for two important jury instructions that attempt to \ndispel common rape myths. \nFailure to Make a Prompt Outcry \nJurors unfamiliar with the  Several Monta1i'a'statute9directly .. \n\ncounter s~;',e oftliietmost long­\n\ndynamics of sexual assault \nstand~f!g andfirmly entri!nch \n\n• \nrap~~ths;.; \n104 \n\n• \nmight assume that a person being assaulted would immediately yell, scream \nand report the crime to police. They may assume that someone who does \notherwise must be lying.  Section 45-5-511(4) counters this myth with a \nstatement of law that \"[e  ]vidence of failure to make a timely complaint or \nimmediate outcry does not raise any presumption as to the credibility of the \nvictim.\" \nResistance is Not Required \nJurors might also mistakenly assume that anyone who is sexually \nassaulted would physically resist.  Section 45-5-511 (5) states, to the \n• \n\ncontrary, that \"[ r ]esistance by the victim is not required to show lack of \nconsent. Force, fear, or threat is sufficient alone to show lack of consent.\" \nWhile neither ofthese principles have been adopted as standard jury \ninstructions, they are commonly offered and given as instructions by judges \nin Montana and should be considered in any case where these issues arise. \nRape Shield Statute \nThe second important provision in § 45-5-511 is what is commonly \ncalled the \"rape shield\" statute.  Section 45-5-511 (3) states: \n•  Evidence concerning the sexual conduct ofthe victim is \ninadmissible in prosecutions under this part except evidence of \n105 \n\n• \nthe victim's past sexual conduct with the offender or evidence \nof specific instances of the victim's sexual activity to show the \norigin of semen, pregnancy, or disease that is at issue in the \nprosecution. \nThe Montana Supreme Court has strictly enforced this statute to \nprevent the trial from becoming a trial of the victim.  See e.g. State v. \nDetonancour, 2001 MT 213, ,-r 21, 306 Mt 389,34 P.3d 487. \nThere are three exceptions to the statute.  Before discussing these \nexceptions, it is important to realize that the rape shield is a rule of \nexclusion, not a rule of admissibility.  Evidence that passes through the rape \nE~idence~iifai; . \nshield pursuant to an exception must still comply \n;ass~~th.r:oughiJi~>J \n•\nrapeshi~ld \n>  with the remaining rules of evidence in order to be \nto: an \npursuan~\nexcep~4tj~tillmust/  admissible.

Frequently, \n/Nld¢'nceim+otder \nevidence ofpast sexual conduct is irrelevant under \n<·\"0' \nto beX(id';'issible~' \nRule 401 or unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403, \nregardless ofthe rape shield statute.  ld. \nThe first exception to the rape shield is \"evidence ofthe victim's past \nsexual conduct with the offender.\"  The important question here is defining \nwhat constitutes \"sexual conduct.\"  The Montana Supreme Court has \n• \ninterpreted this term to include \"sexually intimate\" behavior, but to exclude \n106 \n\n• \n\"flirtatious behavior.\"  State v. Detonancour, 2001 MT 213, ,-r 24, 306 Mt \n389,34 P.3d 487.  The Court did, however, exclude evidence of flirtatious \nbehavior on relevance grounds, stating, \nWe decline to adopt this broad definition of sexual conduct. As \nthe compiler's comments note, if Detonancour and [the victim] \nhad been sexually intimate previous to the assault, that evidence \nwould have been admissible. However, flirtatious behavior is \nnot, contrary to Detonancour's opinion, an invitation to engage \nin sexual relations. An examination into the nuances of the \nvictim's interactions with the defendant days before an alleged \nrape would effectively put the victim on trial. Not only is this \nevidence irrelevant to the issue of consent, it is precisely the \nharm that the rape shield statute is designed to prevent.\" Id. \nWhere the conduct in a specific case falls on this spectrum is fact-\n• \n\nintensive and will depend on the particular circumstances ofthe case, and \nwill typically be intertwined with an a relevancy analysis under Rules 402 \nand 403.  See e.g. Bishop, ,-r 48. \nThe second exception to the rape shield is \"evidence of specific \ninstances ofthe victim's sexual activity to show the origin of semen, \npregnancy, or disease that is at issue in the prosecution.\"  The important \nissue to keep in mind here is that just because the facts ofthe case involve \nsemen, pregnancy or disease does not mean that evidence falls within this \nexception.  The semen, pregnancy or disease must be \"at issue in the \n• \nprosecution.\"  For example, in State v. Bauer, seminal fluid of a person other \n107 \n\n• \nthan the Defendant was allegedly found in the bed sheets ofthe victim. \nState v. Bauer, 2002 MT 7, ,-r 28,308 Mont. 99,29 P.3d 689.  The court \nheld that this DNA is not at issue in the prosecution and excluded by the \nrape shield where the State has not offered the seminal fluid as evidence that \nthe Defendant committed the rape.  Bauer,,-r 31.  On the other hand, ifthe \nState offered evidence that the Defendant impregnated the victim around the \ntime ofthe sexual assault, the rape shield would probably not exclude \nevidence that the victim had sex with someone else around the time of c \nFinally, there is a Sixth Amendment exception to the rape shield that \n• \npermits the Defendant to offer past sexual conduct ofthe victim, if the \nevidence is probative to the victim's credibility. However, \"speculative or \nunsupported allegations are insufficient to tip the scales in favor of a \ndefendant's right to present a defense and against the victim's rights under \nthe rape shield statute.\"  State v. Johnson, 1998 MT 107, ,-r 24,288 Mont. \n513,958 P.2d 1182.  The Montana Supreme Court has specifically \narticulated a test for offering evidence of prior false allegations of non-\nconsensual sexual conduct: \n[t ]he defendant must establish, by a preponderance of the \nevidence, that (1) the accusation or accusations were in fact \nmade; (2) that the accusation or accusations were in fact false;  • \nand (3) that the evidence is more probative than prejudicial. If \n108 \n\n• \nthe defendant satisfies these three conditions, the trial court will \nauthorize cross-examination of the complaining witness \nconcerning the alleged false accusations. The defendant may \nthereafter present extrinsic evidence of the false accusations \nonly if the complaining witness denies or fails to recall having \nmade such accusations. \nState ex. Rei. Mazurek v. Fourth Judicial District Court, 277 Mont. 349, 922 \nP.2d 474 (1996). \n• \n\n• \n109 \n\n• \nChapter 6 \nISSUES IN PROSECUTING SEXUAL ASSAULT \nCASES43 \nIn a non-stranger sexual assault case, rape myths and societal attitudes \nabout victims and offenders conspire to normalize sexual assault, or to \ndisguise it as something consensual.  Sexual assault is excused as \"hooking \nup,\" a \"one-night stand, or drunken sex that the victim later regrets. \nOffenders count on the jury, media, and society at large thinking that, at \nworst, it was sex gone wrong or a misunderstanding.  The prosecutor's job is \n•\nto remove the disguise and recreate the reality ofwhat happened. \nWhen police receive a report of a non-stranger sexual assault, there is \na high likelihood that the suspect is a serial offender.  Accordingly, the \ninvestigation and case development should be as rigorous and thorough as \nthe investigation and prosecution of any other crime where there is reason to \nbelieve that the offense is not likely the first offense.  Instead ofviewing the \nreport with skepticism and scrutinizing the victim and her behavior, law \n43 This chapter was excerpted and modified with pennission from: the Michigan Prosecutors Sexual Assault \nProsecution Manual, published by the Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board and the \nProsecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan (2013); the Wisconsin Sexual Assault Reference Book, published by \nthe Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance (2009); Prosecuting Alcohol-Facilitated Sexual Assault, published by the  • \nNational District Attorneys Association (2007); and Prosecuting Intimate Partner Sexual Assault, The Voice, Volume \nII, No.2, published by the National District Attorneys Association.

In order to properly analyze a sexual assault case, the \ninvestigation should be designed to uncover and address a number of topics. \nThe investigation should provide the prosecutor the ability to develop: \n• \n111 \n\n•\n• \t Pretrial motions in limine to exclude information that invades \nthe victim's privacy or is otherwise irrelevant and/or \nprejudicial; \n• \t Expert witnesses to address the jury's culturally created \n\nskepticism ofvictim behavior; and \n\n• \t A trial strategy that will demonstrate the predatory nature of the \nvictim's conduct. \nPerhaps most importantly, prosecutors must be \nwilling to prosecute cases that may not be easy to win.  Pr(}$ttCtttOFS tnU9'PIirJ;,:::;\nljJiliing~~{1;pFose ,:.:;! ..... \ncases tfillimay nolo \nThe following sections contains information  eCca\" sy to :w.cIn,! .  c\nand questions that investigators and prosecutors could \n• \nkeep in mind, on issues both general and specific, starting at the beginning \nof the case. \nGeneral Questions \n• \t Is there a motive to lie? Although the defense will always \nclaims there is a motive for the victim to lie, the better question \nto ask is whether there is compelling, corroborated evidence \nthat the victim did lie or likely lied. However, anticipating \ndefense claims about a victim's alleged motive to lie is \nimportant to do from the outset of a case. \n• \t If there is no evidence the victim lied, why is her veracity being \nquestioned? \n• \n112 \n\n• \n•  Where did the incident happen?  Which ofthe parties was at the \nincident location first?  Is this a case where the victim went to \nbed and the defendant followed her to her bedroom?  Are the \nfacts ofthe incident consistent with a consensual encounter? \nReporting Issues \n•  What are the time and circumstances ofthe report?  Did the \nvictim come forward as soon as she was physically able or did \nshe wait?  What made her come forward?  Did she tell anyone \nabout the incident prior to going to the hospital or calling the \npolice?  What prompted her to report when she did and why? A \ndelayed report is the norm and should not be considered fatal to \nthe prosecution of a sexual assault case; however, considering \nand understanding the circumstances surrounding the report, \nand the reasons for any delay, must be explored. Investigators \n• \nmust interview any eye or ear witnesses to the delayed report, \nthe sexual assault itself, and to anything that might have \nhappened in the intervening time between the sexual assault and \nthe report to the police. \n• \t When analyzing the impact of a delayed report, remember that, \naccording to the National  College Women Sexual \nVictimization Survey, almost half of the women who are by \ndefinition rape victims do not self-identify as rape victims. \nThese women know that something bad happened to them, that \nsomeone had sex with them when they were too drunk to \nconsent, or that someone held them down and forced them to \nhave sex against their will.  But they often do not label \nthemselves as victims of sexual assault. If a victim does not \nself-identify as such, it will impact her choice to call the police \nimmediately. Victims also need time to process what has \nhappened, as well as people to confide in about what happened. \n• \n113 \n\n• \nInjuries/victim's Physical Condition \n• \t What was the victim's physical condition?  Was she \nmenstruating?  Was she wearing a tampon?  Was she \npreviously injured?  Was she undergoing medical treatment for \na yeast or fungal infection or other uncomfortable condition? \nWas there anything else that would argue against the \nintercourse being voluntary? \n• \t Was the victim injured? If so, what do the injuries show? \n• \t Was there prior interaction between the victim and the \ndefendant?  Are they boyfriend and girlfriend?  Did they even \nknow each other before the night in question? \n• \t Can the victim testify to all elements ofthe crime? \n• \t What theory applies? Did the defendant use force or threaten  • \nthe victim?  Use deception, coercion, or surprise? Was the \nvictim \"mentally incapacitated due to intoxication? Was the \nvictim asleep, unconscious, or passed out? \nInvestigation ofthe Suspect \nAlthough approaching other potential victims who have not reported a \nsexual assault is an extremely sensitive issue, the investigation should \ninclude looking into the suspect's past to determine ifthere are other \nvictims. If other victims are located, the investigator and prosecutor should \ninvolve an advocate, and consider staffing the case with the MDT to \n• \n114 \n\n• \ndetermine whether it is advisable to approach other potential victims. The \ninvestigation ofthe suspect should include: \n• \t Where the suspect hangs out; \n• \t What has he told his friends, co-workers about his sexual \nactivities with others; \n• \t Investigation of the suspect's behavior before, during and after \nthe incident for evidence of premeditation and partial \nadmissions; \n• \t How he selected the victim; \n• \t What he did to test the victim for vulnerability; \n• \n•  What did he do to create and/or exploit vulnerabilities, e.g., did \nhe buy the victim drinks; \n• \t What did he do during the incident; \n• \t The suspect likely will concede significant information to \nofficers, such as acknowledging that the victim was really \ndrunk or that she threw up just before the sexual act \n• \t Exactly how each sexual act occurred and who did what, in \nanticipation that some ofwhat the suspect describes will \nindicate a lack of mutuality; \n• \t What he is claiming is evidence of consent; \n• \t What he did after the assault - who he talked to, whether he \n• \nbragged about the assault, whether he made partial admissions; \ntypically there are witnesses who observed the suspect's \n115 \n\nbehavior and his interaction with the victim, and to whom the  • \nsuspect spoke after the assault, yet all too often those victims \nare never interviewed; \n• \t Look at the defendant's level of intoxication.  What was his \ncapacity to do other things?  Could he walk?  Talk?  Play pool? \nDrive a car?  Was his speech slurred? The more sober he was, \nthe easier it is to show he was a predator, especially if the \nvictim was extremely intoxicated. \n• \t Was there any planning or manipulation on the part of the \ndefendant? Were there any attempts to deceive the victim?  Did \nthe defendant do anything to control the situation and overcome \nthe victim's will?  Did he isolate her?  Did he lie to her? \n• \t Is there any evidence of grooming? Did the defendant do \nanything during the time prior to the sexual assault to gain the \nvictim's trust?  Did he do anything to make it easier to sexually  • \nassault her? Is there any evidence that he set her up?  For \nexample, did he talk about making a \"'special punch\" to get his \n\"target\" drunk?  Did he buy her drinks and encourage her to \ndrink them in an attempt to get her drunk? \n• \t Did the defendant prey upon the victim's vulnerabilities?  Did \nhe do anything to wear down the victim's resistance?  Is there \nany evidence that the defendant selected the victim because he \nknew that she would be an easy target? \n• \t Has the defendant done it before? Have anyone else ever \naccused him of rape or other misconduct? Has anyone ever seen \nwomen leaving his room/apartment/home crying or \ndistraught?\" \n• \t Did the defendant know the victim?  If so, did he use his \nknowledge or familiarity with the victim to gain access to her or  • \n116 \n\n• \n\nto isolate her?  Did he use his knowledge to attempt to silence \nher? \nAnalyzing Credibility and Corroboration \nJurors may bereluctailtil\"~ \nCritical to the prosecution of sexual  to con~lcton the victim's; \nword  they \nalonebeca~se \nassault cases is performing an analysis of  believe tltej need' ..... \n,  \"c· . ~  . ,\"' \nevidence to corroborate \nthe victim's credibility as well as any \nf~ii;tillJ'8 testimo~y:· \n;reg~4··· \ncorroboration that exists.

Moreover, sexual assault cases \nrarely have physical evidence that conclusively proves that a sexual assault \n• \noccurred. Prosecutors are often left with the victim's word, which means that \n117 \n\na jury must find the victim credible before they will convict the defendant.  • \nJurors may be reluctant to convict on the victim's word alone because they \nbelieve they need evidence to corroborate the victim's testimony regarding \nthe actual moment the sexual assault occurred.  This belief is so strong that a \nnumber of states, including Montana, have \njury instructions advising jurors that the  Tlt'e};vi~1!!r';'S';cret(i/jility \ncallb~b~oken down iJ'Ito \nvictim's word need not be corroborated.  fi~r~~o.ponents:;'(t), \nactutzl ~redibility; (2) thtJ:,: \n's \n.,yictim  ability to . . \nHowever, a prosecutor should not be \npe~ceive at the time of'· \ndiscouraged when presented with a case  the iI,cldent; (3) the \nvictim's ability: (q \n• \n\nwhere the primary evidence is the victim's \nrememberwha~~) \nhappe~ed;;(4) tRee \ntestimony.  Although a prosecutor may be \n~i;e~c~;~' \nunable to present physical or other evidence \nto corroborate the victim's testimony about  L  '. '~i~ity.  The first/our \nfactors are valid, \nthe moment of the sexual assault, the \nprosecutor can give context to the victim's \nversion of events, thereby allowing the jury to evaluate her credibility. \nThe victim's credibility can be broken down into five components: \n(I) actual credibility; (2) the victim's ability to perceive at the time of the \nincident; (3) the victim's ability to remember what happened; (4) the  • \n118 \n\n• \nexistence of corroborative evidence; and (5) the victim's likeability.  The \nfirst four factors are valid charging considerations; the fifth is not.  However, \nvictim likeability must be understood and recognized by law enforcement \nand prosecutors ifthey are to obtain a conviction; therefore it is discussed \nherein. \nActual Credibility \nThe first factor is actual credibility.  A victim who was voluntarily \nintoxicated at the time of a sexual assault may feel shame or self-blame for \nallowing herself to be placed in a risky situation.  Consequently, she may be \n• \nreluctant to reveal embarrassing details.  As a result, she may appear to have \nsomething to hide. She may also become hostile and defensive in order to \nprotect herself.  Furthermore, a victim may withhold information she views \nas insignificant without realizing that it is critical to be truthful about every \nminor detail, regardless of how insignificant it may seem to her.  In a case \nwhere the victim deliberately withholds information, lies about small details, \nor is inadvertently inaccurate, jurors will likely be reluctant to convict the \ndefendant because they will be worried that a victim who lies about small \ndetails may be inclined to lie about the sexual assault itself, especially when \n• \n119 \n\n• \nthe law requires the jury to believe the prosecution's case beyond a \nreasonable doubt. \nProsecutors should encourage the victim to be completely honest, \neven about embarrassing or seemingly insignificant details. First, explain to \nthe victim the importance of telling the truth, no matter how painful or \nembarrassing it might be. Explain to the victim the significance of omitting \ninformation, even about seemingly insignificant details. Again, it may take \ntime to develop a rapport with a victim before she is comfortable sharing \npersonal details, but taking the time to do so can make an enormous \n• \ndifference - to the case, and to the victim's experience with the criminal \njustice system. \nAbility to Perceive \nThe second factor that relates to a victim's credibility is how well she \nwas able to perceive what was happening at the time of the incident. This \ngenerally weighs more heavily in drug- and a1cohol- facilitated sexual \nassault cases, as the ability to perceive diminishes as the level of intoxication \nincreases.  A victim who could not clearly perceive what was happening at \nthe time of the crime will not be able to testify in detail about what happened \n• \nbecause she does not know.  lfthe victim was passed out at the time of the \n120 \n\n• \nsexual assault, she had no ability to perceive because she was unconscious. \nUnless the victim woke up during the sexual assault, the prosecution will \nhave to find an alternative way to prove what happened. \nIn an a1cohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault, it rare to know the \nvictim's BAC at the time ofthe sexual assault. Even in cases where the BAC \nis known, the prosecution must analyze the victim's ability to perceive by \ndetermining how the victim was impacted by the consumption of alcohol.  It \nis important to explain the relevance ofperception to victims, especially in \ncases where the lack ofperception is the primary barrier to prosecution. \n• \nIn determining whether the victim's ability to perceive was impaired, \nlook at the following: \n• \t What is the victim able to tell you she perceived at the time? \n• \t Can she relate details ofthe incident? \n• \t Can she tell you who else was there?  What were they doing? \n• \t How intoxicated was the victim? \n• \t Were the victim's motor skills impaired?  Was she able to walk? \nDid she fall? \n• \t What was the victim's physical condition?  Was she vomiting? \n• \t Was her speech slurred? \nThe defense may attempt to challenge the witness's testimony on the \ngrounds that the witness is not competent; however, it is unlikely that a court \n• \nwill find a witness incompetent on this basis as long as the witness can \n121 \n\n• \ntestify that she was able to perceive the incident.  There is a distinction \nbetween attacks on competence and attacks on credibility.  When a witness \nis intoxicated at the time of an occurrence about which the witness has \ntestified, intoxication is a proper matter for the jury to consider as affecting \nthe witness's credibility. \nAbility to Remember \nA victim's memory may be impaired due to trauma, or by the \nconsumption of alcohol or drugs. In order to be able to testify about what \nhappened, the victim must, of course, be able to remember what happened. \n•\nIf she does not remember, there must be some other way to prove what \nhappened or the case cannot go forward.  Although the victim may not \nremember every detail ofthe assault, she may have other information that is \ncrucial to the case.  When interviewing the victim about her memory, \nexplain why you are asking.  Encourage the victim to speak with an \nadvocate for additional support. \nExistence of Corroborative Evidence \nThe fourth factor that relates to victim credibility is the prosecution's \nability to corroborate the victim's version of events.  In cases where \n• \n122 \n\n• \ncorroborative evidence exists, it may compensate for lack ofperception or \nmemory. There is always something more to corroborate the victim if we \nlook hard enough. \nCorroboration is important because it gives the jury a context in which \nto evaluate the victim's testimony.  The evidence might only corroborate a \nsmall piece of the victim's version of events, but each piece of corroboration \nbuilds upon the last and enhances a jury's ability to find the victim credible. \nIn the majority of sexual assault cases, there are almost never any \neyewitnesses to the sexual assault. In order to decide who is credible, jurors \n• \n\nneed a context in which to evaluate the victim's credibility. Prosecutors can \ngive jurors a context by giving them the \"circles of credibility.\"  These \ninclude, among other things, medical evidence, eye and ear witnesses, and \nphysical evidence.  In some cases, a prosecutor might be able to corroborate \na victim's testimony with expert testimony that explains behavior that is \ncounterintuitive to juror expectations.  In others, corroboration might consist \nof the defendant's statement or confession.  The corroborative evidence need \nnot conclusively prove that a sexual assault occurred; rather, it must give the \njury a sufficient context in which to evaluate the victim's credibility. \n• \n123 \n\n•\nConsequently, prosecutors should corroborate everything possible. \nCorroboration may include the following: \n•  Physical evidence. \nInstruct investigators to look for physical evidence that not only \nproves that the act occurred, but also evidence that over- comes \nthe consent defense.  In addition to traditional physical \nevidence, investigators should look for photos on digital \ncameras and cell phones, cell phone records, and any recordings \nthat might exist.  Investigators should also look for proof of \nwhere the victim was and what was done there.  Such evidence \ncan include blood, hair, urine, vomit, clothing, personal items, \nor even credit card receipts. Photographs of any scene related to \nthe sexual assault should be taken in all cases. \n•\n•  Outcry witnesses. \nAs in many sexual assault cases, in cases where the victim was \nintoxicated, the victim may delay reporting, thereby causing \nevidence collection problems.  A delay in reporting may also \ncause credibility issues.  Therefore, it is crucial to explore why \nthe victim delayed reporting. What did she do after the \nincident?  Who saw her first after the incident?  Who did she \nfirst tell?  Why did she report when she did and to whom did \nshe report?  Law enforcement must interview each of those \npeople. \n•  Eyewitnesses to any part ofthe chain of events. \nWhen looking for corroboration, investigators should ask the \nvictim whether anyone else was present during any part ofthe \nincident.  Are there any witnesses to the ingestion of the alcohol \n• \nor to the incident?  What did they see or hear? \n124 \n\n• \n•  Bartenders and waitresses. \nThese witnesses can be critical to a sexual assault prosecution, \neven if the case is proceeding under a theory other than mental \nincapacitation. Investigators should ask them how much the \nvictim had to drink. Did she appear to be drunk or high? In \naddition, they should be asked whether the defendant frequents \nthat bar and, if so, how he behaves when he is there, given the \nresearch that tells us that a high number of these offenders are \nserial offenders. \n•  Friends and family ofthe victim. \nWho sees the victim on a regular basis? Who saw the victim \naround the time ofthe incident? What can the victim's friends \ntell you? Before doing so, however, it may be advisable to \n• \n\ndiscuss this with the victim, as there may be people in her life \nshe does not want to know about the assault. \n•  Other women the defendant may have dated. \nAlthough they may not offer anything beneficial to the \nprosecutor, they may be victims who never reported. \n•  Friends of the defendant. \nEven though interviewing these witnesses may seem illogical \nbecause one would presume they would be on the defendant's \nside, they can frequently corroborate innocuous details, or even \ndisclose details they do not believe to be important, but which \nare crucial to the prosecution's case. \n• \n125 \n\n•\n•  Surveillance recordings. \nRecordings from any place the victim and/or defendant may \nhave gone, can uncover important evidence. \n•  Medical evidence. \nAre there any physical injuries?  What, if anything, do they \ndemonstrate?  Remember that seemingly innocent injuries, such \nas scrapes to the victim's knees from falling down, might \nprovide corroboration of force or incapacitation. \n•  Interview the defendant whenever possible. \nAlthough the defendant may refuse to speak to an investigator, \nmany times suspects in sexual assault cases will want to tell the \npolice why they are not guilty.  They will often want to talk \nabout how the victim consented.  In DFSA cases, the suspect \nwill often admit that he had sex with the victim, but [will claim]  • \nthat it was a consensual act.  The suspect may use the victim's \nhistory of substance abuse or promiscuous behavior to direct \nblame to her and hold her responsible for the sexual contact.  In \nthe case of a consent defense involving a DFSA, investigators \nshould get the suspect to acknowledge the victim's extreme \nlevel of intoxication.  For example, he may admit that she was \nthrowing up and lying in her own vomit.  He will often try to \nconvince the investigator that the sex act was still consensual, \nbut it becomes more difficult for the jury to believe. However, \neven if you know the defendant will refuse to make a statement, \nmaking an attempt to do so will foreclose defense arguments \nthat the investigator didn't try to get the defendant's \"side\" of \nthe story. \n• \n126 \n\n• \n•  Pretext phone calls44 \n• \nMontana allows pretext phone calls in which the victim calls \nthe defendant and the conversation is recorded. A warrant is \nrequired. In these calls, Defendants may acknowledge that \nintercourse occurred and that the victim was intoxicated, which \ncan be useful as corroboration even if, by itself, the recording of \nthe pretext call does not conclusively prove that a sexual assault \noccurred. Investigators planning to do a pretext phone call \nshould check the law and plan carefully. What is going to be \nsaid during the call? What is the goal of the call? Is it to \ncorroborate intercourse, to \ncorroborate that the victim was \npassed out, to show that the \nvictim said no, or some other \ngoal? Decide who is going to \n• \n make the call.  Will it be the \nvictim or a mutual friend?  Ifit \nis going to be the victim, make \nsure that the victim is \nemotionally stable enough to \nhandle the call.

Although the evidence may corroborate non-essential points \nin the case, when it surrounds the victim's testimony, it gives the jury a \ncontext in which to evaluate it. \nVictim Likeability \nAlthough victim likeability is not a valid charging consideration, nor \nis it legally relevant for a jury to consider, jurors tend to believe people they \nlike.  In addition, a jury may decide that a victim who engaged in risky \nbehavior is not as worthy ofprotection as a victim who did not engage in  • \nrisky behavior.  The unfortunate reality of sexual assault cases is that the \nflaws that make the victim a target for the offender also make the victim less \ncredible in a jury's eyes.  For example, a victim who goes to a bar and drinks \nto the point ofvomiting and unconsciousness will be an easy target for a \npredator.  This victim may be viewed with skepticism or dislike by a jury \nthat assumes that she put herself in danger with her behavior.  The jury may \nbe inclined to believe that she assumed the risk of sexual assault by \nbecoming intoxicated to the point of being unable to protect her.  Although \nassumption of the risk is not a defense to sexual assault, defense attorneys  • \n128 \n\n• \nmay use it to achieve jury nullification.  Also, the jury may believe that the \nvictim's risky behavior translated into a \"yes\" and was equivalent to \nconsent; therefore, they may find the defendant not guilty. \nApllroxiitltliJly \nh.

For example, prosecutors \nshould force the defense to follow the rules which were established to \nprotect victims and level the playing field by filing motions in limine. \nAll victims deserve protection; prosecutors and allied professionals \nshould implement strategies for protecting each and every one. In doing so, \nhowever, prosecutors must be cognizant of any flaws that may exist either \nwith the victim or the case in order to ensure the greatest chance of success \n• \nat trial. \n129 \n\n• \nAlcohol- and Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault \nWidespread anecdotal evidence indicates that the majority of rape and \nsexual assault cases being reported to law enforcement involve alcohol use \nby the victim, the defendant, or both. \nJurors may question \ntl'leoffender;' \nwhiJt~ilr \nArriving at a definitive statistic on the \n~C;t}l7JI~;:c~mfmitte4 \nprevalence of alcohol in rape and sexual \nassault cases is an arduous, if not \nimpossible, task.

Yet another estimate finds that \n97,000 college students between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are the \nvictims of alcohol related sexual assaults each year.  Clearly, a high \npercentage of sexual assaults are facilitated by alcohol. \nDespite the prevalence of alcohol-facilitated sexual assault (AFSA), a \nnumber of barriers to successful prosecution exist.  First, the use of alcohol \nin American society is quite common.  Jurors may question whether the \noffender actually committed sexual assault or just had consensual, albeit \ndrunken, sex with the victim.  Second, jurors may view a voluntarily \n• \n intoxicated victim with skepticism or dislike, and may assume that she put \nherself in danger with her behavior.  Research has demonstrated that \nindividuals tend to view women who drink or get drunk as more sexually \navailable, and more likely to engage in sexual acts than women who abstain \nfrom alcohol.  Third, AFSA cases are complicated by the physical \nmanifestations of alcohol. \"Alcohol decreases inhibitions, impairs \nperception, and may cause amnesia and/or loss of consciousness, especially \nifused in conjunction with other drugs.\"  Victims may not be able to clearly \nperceive and/or remember the details of the assault. \n• \n131 \n\n•\n\"If recreational drugs were tools, alcohol \nlfrecr~ationoJ ... \nwould be a sledgehammer.

As alcohol concentration increases, the impairment of \npsychomotor functions such as muscular coordination, balance, eye \nmovement, etc. also increase. As alcohol concentration continues to \nincrease, involuntary movement, such as respiration, is affected, leading to \npossible coma or death. \n• \n132 \n\n• \nAlcohol progressively impairs all bodily functions and abilities \ngoverned by the brain.  Impairment increases as blood alcohol concentration \n(BAC) increases.  BAC can be measured with a sample of blood or breath. \nThe effects of alcohol are exacerbated when ingested in the presence of \nother drugs having depressant effects such as sedatives, hypnotics, \nanticonvulsants, some antidepressants, \nIl~: ti:f<l: ',/t or't •l ..fo.l,<1',b'>l;4.,) ~t rments .v<'7~~J~,~~i:v :<~ ' tranquilizers, some analgesics, and opiates. \nb;: \nc~,~sed Jleohol~.,,~.j':i/i:\\? \ni~toxicated..  .: ~;'~ay \nDue to the cognitive and motor \nlie less likel:.llHiiYn: sober \nwomen torealJi~tltat the,:  impairments caused by alcohol, intoxicated \noff~l1df!~i;;~llgto  ..~ \n• \nwomen may be less likely than sober \n/4!;~~i \n\nwomen to realize that the offender is trying \nPh;~i;ilIlPjorce/al ;\"iti,t< \nto sexually assault them.

However, for \n• \nprosecutors, the toxicological effects of alcohol can present an extreme \n134 \n\n• \nchallenge.  One reason the cases are so difficult is that most cases are \nreported at a time when the victim is no longer intoxicated, making it \ndifficult to assess the victim's BAC at the time ofthe incident. \nToo often, AFSA cases are lost due to improper charging decisions or \ninvestigations that are inadequate to support the charging decision that was \nmade. \nCharging AFSA Cases \nThe most important step in successfully prosecuting AFSA where the \n• \n victim is voluntarily intoxicated is making the correct charging decision.  A \nprosecution cannot succeed if the charges have not been properly filed. \nWhen beginning to analyze whether charges should be filed, the prosecutor \nshould assume that the victim's version of events and any supporting \nevidence is true and accurate.  Analysis of credibility and corroboration will \noccur next, but prosecutors should start with the best possible case scenario. \nIfthe elements ofthe crime cannot be proven when this assumption is made, \nthe prosecutor ultimately will not succeed at trial. \nTo begin, the prosecutor should determine which theory of sexual \nassault to allege.  Three potential charging theories exist for proving sexual \n• \n135 \n\n• \nassault of a voluntarily intoxicated victim. First, sexual assault can be proven \nin the traditional way by demonstrating that the defendant had intercourse \nwith a victim without consent by using force or the threat of force.  In these \ncases, the victim is intoxicated but proof ofthe level of intoxication is not an \nelement ofthe crime.  Intoxication is only relevant to the victim's credibility \nand vulnerability. Second, sexual assault can be proven by showing that the \nvictim was unconscious at the time of the sexual assault and therefore could \nnot consent.  Third, sexual assault can occur when the victim was \"mentally \nincapacitated,\" or too intoxicated to consent.  In those cases, the victim's \nlevel of intoxication must be to the level of the victim being \"temporarily  • \nunable of appreciating or controlling the person's own conduct as a result of \nthe influence of an intoxicating substance.,,45 \nWhen possible, the prosecution should proceed under a theory of \nforce as this is more consistent with the stereotype of sexual assault believed \nby the public, and thus, by potential jurors.  Moreover, the victim's state of \nintoxication, which can be difficult to prove, need not be proven under this \ntheory. \n• \n45-5-201(41). \n45 Mont. Code Ann. \n136 \n\n• \nEven where the measured values are reliable and accurate, substantial \nvariability in tolerances for alcohol, absorption rates, and clearance rates, \nboth among individuals and within the same individual from one situation to \nanother, complicates efforts to deduce the true extent of intoxication at the \ntime of an arrest or accident.  \"Expert testimony would ordinarily be needed \nto establish that the party with the measured or inferred BAC was \nintoxicated during the period in question.\" \nIf no physical force was used but the victim was unconscious or \nasleep, whether intoxicated or not, the prosecution should proceed under the \n• \n\ntheory that the victim was \"physically helpless,\" or that the victim was \n\"unconscious or otherwise physically unable to communicate unwillingness \n46\nto act.,, When dealing with a victim who was unconscious, the primary \nchallenge will be showing that the victim actually was unconscious for all or \npart of the sexual assault.  Meeting the element of penetration also will \nusually be a challenge with an unconscious victim.  If the first two \nalternatives are not options, the prosecution can proceed under the theory \nthat the victim was too intoxicated to consent. \n• \n46 Mont. Code Ann. 45-2-101(58). \n137 \n\nThe State must also prove that the defendant knew the victim was  • \nincapacitated or physically helpless. Once the charging theory has been \ndetermined, a chart analyzing what evidence exists regarding each element \nshould be prepared.  Can the victim testify to all elements ofthe crime?  It is \nnot uncommon for victims who were intoxicated at the time of the crime to \nforget pieces of the incident.  This mayor \nInstead ojassuming that \nmay not be fatal to a prosecution, depending \nit w~spl'obably s~~'kal \nas~~iiM,beca,jje\"the \non whether other evidence exists.

It is the prosecutor's job to show jurors why the case \nbefore them is a case of sexual assault and can be distinguished from \ndrunken or \"regret\" sex. \nGenerally, there is not a bright-line test for showing that the victim \nwas too intoxicated to consent, thereby distinguishing sexual assault from \ndrunken sex.  In drunk driving cases, the prosecution can show that the \ndriver had a certain BAC; therefore, the driver is guilty.  Sexual assault cases \n• \n\ninvolving alcohol are not as clear cut.  There is not a universal BAC at \nwhich the law or the experts agree that people are no longer capable of \nconsenting to intercourse.  Instead, the equation involves an analysis of the \ntotality ofthe circumstances and numerous factors.  The factors discussed \nherein are divided into two parts:  (1) general factors; and (2) predatory \nbehavior on the part ofthe defendant.  By analyzing these factors and \nconsidering the totality ofthe circumstances, the prosecutor can determine \nwhether the case is sexual assault or not. \nAnalyzing Consent: General Factors \nHow drunk was the victim? The more intoxicated the victim was, the \n• \n139 \n\n• \nless likely it is that she was capable of consenting. The following factors can \naid in this determination: \n• \t Was she conscious or unconscious? Did she regain conscious­\nness during the sexual assault? Did she pass out during the \nsexual assault? If so, what did the accused do? \n• \t Did she black out? \n• \t Did she vomit? \n• \t Could she speak? Was she slurring? Was she able to \ncommunicate coherently? \n• \t Was she able to walk or did someone (in particular, the \ndefendant) have to carry her?  Did she have to lean on \nsomeone? \n• \t Was she able to dress/undress herself? \n• \t Were her clothes disheveled? \n• \t Was she responsive or in a nonresponsive state? \n• \t Was she able to perform physical tasks or was her coordination  • \nimpacted?  For example, did she light the wrong end of a \ncigarette or spill things? \n• \t Did she urinate or defecate on herself? \n• \t What was her level of mental alertness? \n• \t Did she do anything else to indicate whether she was capable of \ncognitive functioning?  For example, did she use her credit \ncard?  Did she use her cell phone or e-mail? \nAnalyzing Consent: Defendant's Predatory Behavior \nProsecutors will face perhaps their greatest challenge in AFSA cases \nwhere the defendant was drunk as well. Alcohol consumption by offenders \nand victims tends to co-occur.  The reality is that approximately fifty percent \n• \nof all sexual assaults are committed by a man who has been drinking. \n140 \n\n• \n\"Although alcohol consumption and sexual assault frequently co-occur, this \nphenomenon does not prove that alcohol use causes sexual assault.\" \nNevertheless, many defendants will attempt to use alcohol as an excuse for \nsexual assault.  The public has a tendency to view sexual assault of a \nvoluntarily intoxicated victim as more of an opportunistic crime than a \npredatory crime.  When a jury hears that the defendant was drinking, it is \neasy for jurors to assume that it was drunken sex as opposed to sexual \nassault unless prosecutors disenchant them of the idea.  Jurors may think: \n\"There but for the grace of God, go I (or my son or my friend).\"  It is the \n• \n prosecutor's job to keep the focus on the defendant and his behavior. \nMost states, including Montana, do not recognize voluntary \nintoxication as a defense. Prosecutors can overcome the hurdle of the \nintoxication defense by looking for the defendant's predatory behavior.  The \nprosecutor must look carefully at all the facts of the case to determine \nwhether the defendant is a predator. Often, a successful predator will mask \nhis actions in such a way that they appear opportunistic as opposed to \npredatory.  \n• \n141 \n\n•\nTrying Alcohol- and Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault Cases \nAFSA cases are difficult to win at trial. Jurors tend to view AFSA cases \nas crimes of opportunity rather than deliberate, intentional crimes; therefore, \nit is not uncommon for them to be forgiving of defendants accused ofAFSA. \nThe prosecutor can overcome this tendency by using an offender-focused \napproach to the trial.  This focus explains to the jury why an offender would \nprey upon a person like the victim.  The characteristics that cause the victim \nto seem flawed to the jury--and thus \nch~~~f~~~isti~i~l~at, \nTt,e  unlikeable--are the same characteristics that \ncausettim \ntQ;seem:~ \n'.if:::~~;!!t~J \nmade her an appealing victim to the \n~,!:,\";/, ,,;~~tf!i!tIuJ~ \n,  offender.  The offender selected her because  • \nntadqilt'etttr,;a  . . .ling .. \nj:~ \n~icti~tb'th;~  r.. ...:.  ofthose very characteristics. \nCommunicating this to the jury refocuses \nthe jury's attention on the defendant's predatory behavior.  Utilizing an \noffender-focused investigation and prosecution can show jurors why the \ndefendant before them is a predator, not a nice guy caught in a bad \npredicament through no fault of his own.  Although prosecutors generally \nfocus on the offender when trying any other criminal case, they tend to focus \non the victim and any of the victim's flaws or vulnerabilities in sexual \n• \n142 \n\n• \nassault cases.  Sexual assault cases must be tried in the same way that other \ncriminal cases are tried--with a focus on the offender. \nInstead of viewing a victim's vulnerabilities as weaknesses, explain \nwhy a predator would target a person with those vulnerabilities.  The reality \nof sexual assault cases is that the better a target a victim is for an offender, \nthe worse the victim generally will be viewed as a witness for the \nprosecution.  The flaws that make the victim a target for the offender also \noften make the victim less credible in a jury's eyes.  For example, a victim \nwho goes to a bar and drinks to the point ofvomiting and unconsciousness \n• \nwill be an easy target for a predator.  A victim \nwho becomes voluntarily intoxicated does not \ndo so with the expectation that she will be \nsexually assaulted.  Voluntary intoxication does  vulnetaoilities~; ;1ize \nteajit;z\"/JJs'it~l,llas~au \nnot equal consent to sexual acts.

However, in 2005, only seven percent of \nsexual assaults involved the use of a firearm and three percent involved a \nknife.\"  Non-stranger offenders generally use only the force necessary to \novercome the victim's resistance.  In many \ncases, this may equate to nothing more than \nlying on top ofthe victim and pinning her  •\n,~};\\~~ \nem~tionaI/(Jrc~-thluse  arms down.  Non-stranger offenders are also \no/deceptlon,' \nfar more likely to gain control oftheir\n~anipulation, planltlng, \n\nR~~,,.editatit;Jn'fJnd  ' . \n\nvictims through psychological or emotional \nforce-the use of deception, manipulation, planning, premeditation, and \nbetraying victims' trust. One ofthe most common tools used by non-stranger \noffenders is alcohol.  Prosecutors should look for evidence of all ofthese \ntools. \n• \t Did the defendant lie to the victim by promising her a safe ride \nhome and then driving her to a field where he sexually \nassaulted her?  • \n144 \n\n• \n•  Did he trick her by asking to come inside her home to use the \nbathroom? \n• \t Did he buy her drinks or convince her to keep drinking when \nshe wanted to stop? \nThe prosecutor can focus on other themes as well when prosecuting \nan offender-focused AFSA case.  Sample themes include:  \"Who needs force \nwhen you have alcohol?\" or \"The defendant committed the perfect crime.\" \nThe prosecutor can also argue, \"A predator picks his prey;\" however, use \ncaution when labeling an offender ofAFSA a \"predator\" at trial.  Although a \nperson who sexually assaults an incapacitated victim is a predator, the jury \n• \nmay view the prosecution as overzealous ifjurors are not convinced that the \ndefendant is a predator. Instead, show that the defendant acted intentionally, \ndeliberately, thoughtfully, and freely, and that he was in charge. \nVictims with Mental Illness \nIn working with survivors of sexual assault, it is important to \nunderstand how mental health and mental illness may interact with sexual \nassault to affect the person's thinking, emotions and behavior.  One must \nunderstand the nuances ofmental health issues or normal coping responses \nand mental illness.  This may be difficult as mental health and mental illness \n•  exist on a continuum.  Mental health can be defined as a psychological state \n145 \n\n• \nof someone who is functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and \nbehavioral adjustment. This definition does not exclude one from \nexperiencing a full range of emotions--anger, sadness, happiness, frustration­\n-or from exhibiting a wide range of behaviors.  For example, a person who \ncomes home and picks a fight with their spouse every night during a difficult \nweek at work may be experiencing a mental health issue--stress and anger. \nHowever, she would not necessarily be diagnosed with a mental illness. \nA mental illness is the psychological state of someone who has \nemotional or behavioral problems serious enough to require psychiatric \n• \nintervention.  If the same person realizes over a few months that she is \nchronically angry and has begun to fight with multiple people in her life, is \nexperiencing insomnia, tearfulness, and feels hopeless about future \npossibilities, she may be diagnosed with depression.  Her coping skills have \nbeen overwhelmed to a point that her emotional experience and her \nbehaviors are interfering with her ability to function well. \nWhen one experiences a traumatic event like sexual assault, there are \nthree possible scenarios for the interaction of that event with mental illness. \nAll three of them are important to understand. \n• \nScenario 1 \n146 \n\n• \nAny person who experiences a sexual assault and has no pre-existing \nmental illness will engage in coping behaviors--which is the normal \nresponse to trauma. Some of those behaviors may appear to be \"mental \nillness\" but may simply be a normal response to trauma. For example, a \nvictim may cry frequently, experience extreme anxiety at going out with \nfriends, and/or lose her appetite. These may be described as mental health \nissues, but they are not an illness.  However, the victim may benefit from \nand be receiving mental health support and services around these issues.  As \nis described previously, there is a wide variety of cognitive, psychological, \n• \n physical and emotional coping behaviors a victim may use in an attempt to \nregain her equilibrium.  If these behaviors continue unabated, or are so \nsevere that she is unable to function, the victim may develop mental illness \nas is depicted in Scenario 2. \nScenario 2 \nAnother scenario that may happen to the person who has no pre­\nexisting mental illness is the sexual assault overwhelms this person's ability \nto cope and their efforts to regain equilibrium are unsuccessful. This \nsituation may lead a person to develop a mental illness in response to the \n•  event.  Research suggests that victims of sexual assault are more likely than \n147 \n\n• \nthe non-victimized population to develop depression, substance abuse and \neating disorders.  It is estimated that 17-65% may develop post-traumatic \nstress disorder. \nScenario 3 \nIn the third scenario, a person who has a mental illness experiences a \nsexual assault.  A traumatic experience will increase the likelihood ofre­\noccurrence or the worsening of symptoms of a mental illness.  It is also \nimportant to note that people who suffer from a mental illness are more \nlikely to be targeted by an offender of sexual \n• \nassault. This may be due to several factors. A \n;;~~~eal~!Q,ti(Jn is, \nperson with mental illness may be seen as a less  C'? \nsam/e'thing\nn(Jt~he \na* \n~'jalse;,repor~'.. \ncapable or credible witness.  For example, a \nperson who experiences delusions or psychotic episodes may have a difficult \ntime giving a clear account ofthe assault, and those who are hearing that \naccount may have difficulty distinguishing reality from the person's illness. \nPeople with mental illness may be more accessible as well, especially when \nin institutional settings or needing care. \nRecanting Victims \n• \nIt is critically important to know that a recantation is not the same thing \n148 \n\n• \nas a false report.  A false report is when the investigation factually proves \nthe sexual assault never occurred. Recantation is when there is a retraction or \nwithdrawal of a reported sexual assault. A recent study found that the actual \npercentage of false reports in sexual assault is between 2-8%.  This is no \ndifferent than false reports for any other crime. \nThere are many reasons why a victim would recant a report of sexual \nassault even ifthe sexual assault really did occur. Victims of sexual assault \nmay recant because: \n• \t They did not realize the toll that the criminal investigation \n• \n\n(lengthy court delays, etc.) would take on them mentally, \nemotionally, physically, and financially. They just want it to \nend and try to go on with their life and put it behind them. \n• \t Pressure from the offender his or offender's family or friends to \nrecant because the victim is \"ruining\" his life; or, pressure from \nthe victim's family or friends, particularly in a higher-profile \nsexual assault case. \n• \t Pressure that they are the whole case for the prosecution and \ntherefore they are responsible for sending the offender to \nprison. Many times victims do not want the offender to go to \nprison--they just want the abuse to stop. A victim may also \nworry about the offender, worry about whether the offender is \nokay while waiting for the outcome ofthe trial, and worry if the \noffender will be okay in prison . \n• \n149 \n\n•  Victims are dealing with the trauma ofthe sexual assault and  • \nare unable to cope with even the basic life tasks, such as \nworking or school, let alone testifying in a courtroom. \n• \t Victims fear that they will be blamed or attacked within the \nsystem for the sexual assault and therefore drop out to avoid \nfurther attacks and doubt from others in their life (family, \ncriminal justice professionals, friends, etc.). \nBecause recantation is used by victims to halt criminal justice \ninvolvement, it should never be viewed, in and of itself, as an indication of a \nfalse report.\"  A victim-centered response necessitates that prosecutors and \npolice investigate whether a recantation is a result of a system failure, \n•\nwitness tampering or other factors that are outside the control of \ninvestigators or responders. While recantations present challenges for the \ncriminal justice system, they should not deter prosecutors from considering \nthe viability of the case.  In the event that a recantation is the result of duress \nthe victim experienced, prosecutors may be able to successfully educate the \njudge and jury on the causes ofthe recantation.  Prosecutors should carefully \nconsider the victim's needs and wishes in making a decision when a \nrecantation arises. \nIssues Specific to Adolescent Victims \n• \n150 \n\n• \nAdolescent victims face their own unique challenges, and are targeted \nby the same rape myths and stereotypes adult victims face, and then some. \nThis section will discuss some of the negative stereotypes the defense may \nuse and strategies prosecutors can use to educate juries about how offenders \nprey on adolescents. \nNegative Stereotypes ofAdolescents \nAdolescents face an uphill battle when they are reporting themselves \nas victims of sexual abuse. There are many negative stereotypes within our \nsociety concerning adolescents. These include that adolescents are: \n• \n\n•  Promiscuous \n•  Liars \n•  Lazy \n•  Untrustworthy \n•  Rebellious \n•  Drug and alcohol-using \n•  Delinquents \n•  Difficult \n•  Disrespectful \n•  Gang members \n•  Have bad attitudes \n• \n151 \n\n• \nAs with any stereotype, sometimes one or more of these \ngeneralizations may be true for a particular individual.  However, most \nadolescents are not most ofthese things, and if one or more generalization \ndoes apply, it should not dictate an out-and-out disregard for an adolescent \nreport of abuse.  In fact, sometimes adolescents engage in these behaviors \nbecause they have been physically or sexually abused or neglected.  Many \nof these qualities are responses to trauma, or armor which the adolescent \nwears to cover up his/her vulnerability and seem tougher than he/she really \nIS. \n• \nKnowing that you and/or the investigating officers might approach an \nadolescent case viewing it through the lens of one or more of these \nstereotypes is the first step in getting past the stereotype and assessing the \ncase with a more objective lens.  Knowing that your jury may also view the \ncase through a stereotype--or that the defense might exploit these stereotypes \nto discredit an adolescent victim--requires planning during the pre-charging \nstage. Prosecutors can deconstruct the stereotype by taking the time to learn \nabout the individual adolescent: \n• \t What is his/her life like, and how did he/she get to this place in \nhis/her life? \n• \n152 \n\n• \t\n•  How/why did this victim become involved with the offender? \n• \t What did the offender exploit in hislher relationship with the \nadolescent? \n• \t Why did the adolescent make the decisions he/she did \nconcerning cooperating  with abuse? \n• \t When did the adolescent disclose the assault and to whom? \n• \t How does the adolescent view his/her involvement with the \noffender? \n• \t Does the \"stereotype\" hold up wider this scrutiny or can it be \nhumanized and understood? \n• \n\nOnce you start to deconstruct the stereotype, you must continue to \ndevelop ways to explain the adolescent's actions, not only in your \npresentation of the child, but also in the supporting evidence you provide.  Is \nthis the kind of case that could benefit from an expert to explain about a \nparticular adolescent lifestyle or about adolescent developmental issues? \nIn addition, prosecutors should explore strategies to: (a) expose the \nstereotypes about adolescents; (b) move jurors past making a decision based \nupon stereotypes (starting with voir dire questions); and (c) identify ways to \ndevelop testimony designed to raise this sort of consciousness.  For instance, \n• \nemphasizing that adolescents are protected by the law, and eliciting \n153 \n\nresponses as to why adolescents are viewed by the legislature as children  • \nand not \"little adults\" may be one area oftopic development during voir \ndire.  Asking an expert or a police officer to \nAs;iJzf~e~~lt;jfthfJi..lt;verat: \nexpound on how adults are able to prey on \nwlii~h; th~ii:)jrai~iJr~';' ' \nop~r;tihg,;their d~~isi~n'\" \nadolescents may develop this theme further \nm~kingisfreque~tly \nirrational, and \nduring the presentation of evidence.

Consequently, adolescents make bad decisions. Furthermore, when \nasked why they made a particular bad decision, adolescents often cannot  • \n154 \n\n• \nreally provide a rational explanation--because there really isn't a rational \nexplanation.  While their decision may make sense to them at the time they \nare making it, these decisions usually don't measure up to the same level of \nrational thought that we expect from an adult decision. \nCovering Behavior \nAdolescents, like adult victims, will at times lie or mislead about how \nthey got into that situation, what they did prior to or during the situation, or \nleave out important facts. Adolescents do this because they believe that \nrevealing accurate information will get them into trouble and/or they'll be \n• \n\nblamed or disbelieved. \nFor example, an adolescent may have slept late and missed the school \nbus, and then accepted a ride from a stranger, who then took the adolescent \nsomewhere other than school and assaulted the adolescent.  The adolescent, \nwhen disclosing the abuse, made up a story about being forced into the car in \nsome fashion, thinking that he'd get into trouble for admitting that she \nmissed the bus and/or that she accepted a ride from a stranger.  The part \nabout the abuse is true and accurate, but how and why she ended up in the \ncar with the stranger in the first place is a lie . \n• \n155 \n\n• \nOther typical topics about which adolescents frequently lie to cover \nfor a bad decision include: \n•  Skipping school \n•  Drinking alcohol \n•  U sing drugs \n•  Engaging in cooperative sexual activity \n•  Lying to the offender about their age \n•  Prostituting \n•  Runaway status \nWithholding Information \n•\nIn addition to outright lying, adolescents also may leave out this \nnegative information.  For instance, in the example given above, add that en \nroute, the adolescent smoked marijuana with the stranger.  The detail about \nthe marijuana may be completely absent from the adolescent's story. \nInvestigators often find these sorts of facts out in conversation with the \noffender, who has every motive to want to make the child look bad and \nunbelievable, and therefore provides lots of negative information about the \nchild.  Or, the adolescent may disclose the negative fact to a friend, or may \nbe \"caught\" being truant, drunk or high, etc. \n• \nInterviewing Adolescents \n156 \n\n• \nThese behaviors create credibility issues which have to be assessed at \nthe pre-charging stage.  There are several strategies that prosecutors can use \nto encourage adolescents to provide a full and accurate accounting of events: \n• \t Get the most factually complete, accurate and truthful \ninformation from the adolescent victim. Utilizing interview \ntechniques that address the potential concerns ofthe adolescent, \nincluding that they may be \"in trouble\" should be done at the \noutset. \n• \t Reassure the adolescent that her drinking is not the focus of \nyour inquiry, and that a sexual assault is a serious matter that \nfar outweighs the gravity of the adolescent's drinking. \n• \n • \t Emphasize that crime deals in reality and that you can handle \nwhatever the truth is--in fact, that you need to know the whole \ntruth because that is the only way that you can properly address \nit in your case. \n• \t Let the adolescent know that lots of kids initially choose to \nwithhold important information or even make up something \nthey think might make them look better. Stress that the best \ntime to set the record straight is at the beginning of the case. \nThe types of \"lies\" or omissions outlined above are not \ninsurmountable credibility hurdles to a criminal prosecution.  They will \nrequire that the adolescent be truthful under oath, even if that means \nadmitting that part ofwhat he/she said was initially a lie.  This would be an \n• \n157 \n\n• \narea to flesh out during a direct exam of the victim at trial, and to prepare the \nvictim for thoroughly.  It may also be appropriate to consider the testimony \nof an expert who is well-versed in adolescent issues to remind jurors that this \nkind of poor decision-making is typical of adolescents.  You can also remind \njurors that this is one of the reasons why we have laws protecting \nadolescents from their own bad decisions in the first place.  These are also \nissues which should be addressed in voir dire with a jury. \nAdolescent Brain Development Issues \nAs with child victims, a basic understanding of adolescent brain \ndevelopment is useful to inform prosecutor's interactions with youth during  • \nthe investigation and prosecution of a sexual assault. Knowledge ofbrain \ndevelopment can also be used to educate a jury on why a youth behaved the \nway that he/she did before, during and following the assault. \nWhile many adolescents have a mature physical appearance, no one \nshould be deceived into thinking that an adolescent is equal to an adult in \nmaturity or cognitive development. \nResearch shows that the capacity for \"formal operation thought\" \nbegins in adolescence, according to developmental psychologist Jean Piaget. \n• \n158 \n\n• \nThis kind of thought characterizes adult cognition, and involves the ability to \nreason hypothetically, to take into account a wide range of alternatives, and \nto reason \"contrary to fact.\" Studies have shown that this capability exists in \nonly 30-40% of adolescents and adults in America.\"  A formal thinker can \nunderstand similes, allegories and metaphors.  They can also think about \ntheir own thinking and about other people's thinking.  They can consider \nsomeone else's motives and perspectives.  They can develop theories and \nconcepts apart from concrete reality. In contrast to these abilities, most \nadolescents think concretely, which is more black and white, immediate and \n• \n has a more restricted perspective . \nEgocentrism \nIn their interaction with the world, adolescents display this \negocentrism.  In their world, there is an \"imaginary audience,\" (a term used \nby psychologist David Elkind) who, from the standpoint ofthe adolescent, \nknows the adolescents private thoughts and feelings. They feel very much \nlike they are always being watched and judged by this \"audience.\"  Elkind \nalso describes that adolescents have a \"personal fable\" which results in an \nunrealistic belief in their own invulnerability and uniqueness.  In other \n•  words, they believe and act like they are a lot older and more mature then \n159 \n\n• \nthey really are. As a result, an adolescent can put himself or herself into a \nsituation that is way over his/her head, but which he/she thinks he/she can \nhandle just fine.  Youth who have been sexually victimized experience the \nultimate assault to their egocentric belief that they are invulnerable. \nSelf-Blame \nAdolescents may have some cognitive ability to understand how the \nworld works, but they are psychologically predominantly egocentric.  Since \nthey are so self-focused, they have a more difficult time seeing the \nperspectives of others, and they also tend to blame themselves for events, \neven when that attribution ofblame is excessive.  Adolescents may blame  • \nthemselves for things beyond their control.  This kind of self-blame \ndifferentiates adolescent egocentrism from that ofthe younger child.  While \nthe younger child thinks \"everything happened because of me,\" the \nadolescent thinks \"I should have been able to stop it.\"  The implications for \nyouth who have been sexually victimized are clear. \nAn adolescent's emotional development is focused on forming his/her \nidentity and fitting in with peers.  They are far less concerned with how \nadults view them.  Adolescents have been described as being more confident \n• \nthan competent.  Most adults are familiar with adolescent emotional \n160 \n\n• \nvolatility. Some of the ramifications of adolescent brain development \ninclude that the adolescent may include: \n• \t Fearing being disbelieved \n• \t Being embarrassed by the topic or hislher actions \n• \t Feeling responsible \n• \t Wanting to protect others, including the abuser \n• \t Expressing the belief that he/she is the only one who can and \nshould address the situation \n• \t Being uncertain ofhow their actions in the situation will be \njudged by you \n• \n • \t Fearing retaliation or social consequences \nIn addition, adolescents may also experience language or \ncommunication issues that result in the adolescent having trouble putting \nevents in order, not completely understanding questions, answering only \nparts of questions, and not listening well. \nFor the adolescent, control is an important issue.  Allow the \nadolescent to feel in control of as much of an interview as possible.  Also, \ngive the adolescent some control over decisions.  Examples include asking \nthe adolescent for input and feedback, and planning with the adolescent for \n•  future safety at pre-charging, as well as throughout the course of any case. \n161 \n\nIn cases where you have an adolescent who looks at lot older than  • \nhe/she is cognitively or emotionally, it may be helpful to consider how you \ncan inform the jury about this.  Is there a teacher or social worker who can \nprovide information that will be helpful to the jury in their credibility \ndeterminations, especially if you think the jury may initially have unrealistic \nor uninformed opinions about your victim? \nAdolescent Runaways \nAn adolescent runaway lives an extremely high-risk lifestyle (a risk they do \nnot appreciate), in which his/her vulnerability is almost always exploited and \nmanipulated.  When \"on the run,\" the adolescent necessarily has to find food  • \nand shelter, and is generally at the mercy of \nthe adult who steps in to provide those basic \nneeds. Perhaps the adolescent is required to \ni:(fhs~iiltei1ee~ \nhave sex with the adult.  Perhaps the \nrepo~tiltg are worse thalJ;; \nthe consequences offlo'ir:: \nadolescent is required to prostitute himself or \nrelll?fting.:i~i'i ma:y~(jve~J'l \n'little omi/iJunity t(jt: . \nherself for the adult, or to pose for \nand ifshe does, is \nrepor~, \npornographic photos, engage in \"exotic\"  faced with disbel{efan\"d'~;~ \nhlam~  ..Xf:'·i~~~;;f;: ~ .'. . ,  \ndancing, etc.  The adolescent may consider \nthis to be voluntary activity on their part. In addition to these behaviors, the  • \n162 \n\n• \noffender will often reward the adolescent with alcohol or require the \nadolescent to engage in drug use, making the adolescent even more \nvulnerable and enhancing the adolescent's feelings of self-blame. \nAs a general rule, runaway adolescents do not come from healthy, \nstable homes.  Many have been abused within the family and the family is \nunstable and dysfunctional.  Life on the streets may seem safer and more \nappealing to the adolescent for this reason.  It is easy to manipulate the \nvulnerable adolescent by telling her what she wants to hear, treating her like \nthe \"adult\" she thinks she is, and yet providing basic needs.  Often the sexual \n• \n\nabuse is pitched as a quid pro quo for this protection and case.  He's \n\"helping her get on her feet.\"  As time with an adult pimp continues, \nhowever, the \"feel-good\" techniques are replaced with more overt violence. \nThey are watched. Runaways are also beaten and threatened.  They are \nisolated and imprisoned, literally and figuratively. \nIt is very hard for this adolescent to disclose her runaway status. She \nmay not view himself as a victim.  She might conclude that the \nconsequences of reporting are worse than the consequences of not reporting. \nShe may have little opportunity to report, and if she does, is faced with \n•  disbelief and blame. She might have built up a tough shell, hard to puncture . \n163 \n\n• \nOften, adolescent runaways are arrested for prostitution or picked up as \nmissing and treated as suspects instead of as victims. \nStrategies for Working with Runaways \n• \t Before an interview, get as much history about the adolescent \nas possible.  CPS or prior delinquency files should be reviewed. \n• \t Do not lecture or interrogate the adolescent.  These are surefire \nways for shutting the child down and creating impenetrable \nbarriers. Instead, use a more open-minded, empathetic listening \napproach, not only in getting a disclosure, but in cementing a \nrelationship with the child that can carry through the \nprosecution. \n• \t Runaway adolescents present with a number ofpersonal \nphysical, medical and psychological needs, all ofwhich should  • \nbe attended to. \n• \t Find out what the adolescent is concerned about and allay any \nfears you can.  Stick to the truth. \n• \t Recognize that the adolescent has been groomed not to \ndisclose. Understand how the child was particularly vulnerable \nand how the offender used that to groom the adolescent. \n• \t Prepare for the reality that the adolescent will likely come \narmed with rationalizations for what happened and probably \nhave a history involving law enforcement that has probably \nnegatively colored his/her views of authority figures. This will \ncolor his/her interest in cooperation. \n• \n164 \n\n• \n•  Talk about protecting others, about what the offender may have \nwanted in return for being \"nice.\" Stress a focus on the \"facts\" \nbefore turning to any judgments about \"what should happen.\" \n• \t Although tempting, do not lower your vocabulary to match the \nadolescent. An equally fatal mistake is to engage in questioning \nthat carries with it negative assumptions. Take care with your \nlanguage to avoid judgments and don't assume that the \nadolescent felt one way or another. \n• \t Adolescent runaway cases can almost always be corroborated. \nMake sure your investigator has obtained search warrants for \nthe various places involved and a list ofnames of people who \nwitnessed anything. This could include other adolescent \nvictims, adult prostitutes, or adult \"customers.\" Adolescents are \nsometimes advertised on Craigslist or other web sites or \n• \n newspapers.  Motels may have security cameras or records that \ncould yield corroborative information.  The large market for \nchild porn makes it tempting for predatory adults to film or \nphotograph these adolescents, as well. \nIn deciding on charges, factor in what you can prove with witness \nstatements and outside evidence.  Realistically, you may not have the victim \navailable for trial, as there is always the possibility that the child will run \nagain.  To this end, there may be a need to call for CPS services, even \nincluding placement in a facility where it would be difficult to run away. \nThis is, of course, entirely dependent on the needs ofthe adolescent. \n• \n165 \n\nKeeping track of this victim, and having periodic meetings, just to keep in  • \ntouch, can be helpful. \nAdolescents Have Sex \nIt's a bad idea for adolescents to have sex with each other, but they \ndo.  They don't think it's a bad idea.  Sometimes a prosecutor will charge \nthese adolescent-on-adolescent cases, usually when there is some \naggravating factor, like a pregnancy, or a significant age difference. \nAdolescent-on-adolescent cases may also require, if they are going to be \ncharged, mutual charges. Often these cases resolve with misdemeanors \nwhich can be expunged, via deferred prosecution agreements or diversion  • \nagreements.  Deciding on what facts should come into play about whether to \ncharge, what to charge, and how to resolve these cases is good to do as a \nmatter of policy, with an eye toward the goal of reducing irresponsible \nadolescent sex. Important points to remember include: \n•  It is always a crime when an adult has sex with an adolescent. \nAdults and adolescents are not on the same playing field, and \nvirtually anyone would agree that the 30 year old man cannot \nreasonably be said to be a legitimate boyfriend ofthe 14 year \nold girl. \n•  When dealing with a case where an adolescent has had sexual \n• \nintercourse with others, cooperatively, prior to the situation you \n\n166 \n\n\n• \nare reviewing, it is important to remember that such prior \nactions by the adolescent do not explain, excuse or justify the \ndecisions of the adult in having intercourse with that \nadolescent. They are also inadmissible under the Rape Shield \nstatute. Her reputation ofpromiscuity is irrelevant to a \ndetermination of any of the issues in your case. \n• \t Discussion about therapy to help the adolescent make better \ndecisions about sexual behavior is also in order. Having the \nadolescent's parent on board with this is essential. It may be \npreferable to delegate that conversation to the advocate. \n•  With adolescents who have engaged in \"promiscuous\" \nbehavior, it is important to make advocacy and mental health \nreferrals, ifthey haven't already been \nmade.  Sexual acting out is often a sign \n•  of other serious issues in that \nadolescent's life. \nConsistent with a victim-centered approach, \nprosecutors must educate judges and juries about \nthe realities about adolescent sexuality in our \nsociety and help juries to understand that the past \nsexual behavior ofthe adolescent victim does not justify the assault. \nAdolescents Easily \"Get In Over Their Heads\" \nAdolescents often find themselves in situations that move beyond \ntheir ability to effectively handle. This is because adolescents feel invincible, \n• \nare more confident than competent, disregard or don't understand potential \n167 \n\n• \nrisks, and are trying to develop their \n• rg to the \nadolescent, it is alwllJ!s '  independence.  These factors all operate \nimp~rt4itltotrytoget at \nagainst the fact that their brains are not \nthe issuep'£\"consent\" \n,£,om ~iJt;~~irl>angl(s. :,. \noperating at the level of good rational \nFirst, Setop using the \nword,~tr:filrsenA,l\"  .  .. \n,t  decision-making.

Consequently, they are easily overwhelmed \nin these circumstances. \nLike adult victims, once an adolescent is in a situation that is \"over \n• \nher head,\" an adolescent may experience panic and fear, confusion about \nwhat to do, and be unable to think of a way to extricate her other than \n\"cooperating\" with the demands of the offender. The adolescent may also be \nfeelings the neurobiological effects oftrauma or tonic immobility. \nThis \"cooperation\" can look like consent and the adolescent may even \ndescribe that she \"willingly\" engaged in sex.  Adolescents are not good at \nparsing out true \"consent\" from buckling under pressure or subtle coercion \nthat resulted in her cooperation.  Given the adolescent tendency to accept \nblame and responsibility, the perspective that she \"consented\" is \nunderstandable, although flawed.  • \n168 \n\n• \nIn talking to an adolescent, it is always important to try to get at the \nissue of\"consent\" from several angles.  First, stop using the word \"consent.\" \nInstead, talk about whether she \"wanted\" to \nhave sex with the offender.  Ask about what led \nup to the sex. Ask who brought up the idea of \nhaving sex.  Discuss how she was feeling and \nwhat she was thinking leading up to the sex. \nMany times the adolescent will say that \noffender suggested sex, or tried to take her \n•  clothes off, and she didn't want him to.  Find \nout what she said to let him know that--or \nwhether she didn't know how to tell him to \nstop, or that she did not want to have sex. Be \n,e  ,  \" , \n!;~lfillQcenti'play. wlticiJ' \nsure to ask whether the perpetrator would have \n$e;;es'ttlblil:r the place;;; \n, '>'''L',  '  ,,';';\"  '>\" /'.\nseen or heard anything to indicate she did not  wJU!re, t  ' \"  is cfossed:~ \nfro~'t~;  t\" or.'\"  \" \nwant to have sex.  'ai:'identalletto,s~uall~ \nan ,;/'  rposjiful.\" \",,'  \" \nIf she initially said \"no\" or \"stop,\" what \nwas the offender's reaction?  How did that make her feel?  What was she \nthinking at that point?  Why did she end up having sex?  Was she planning \n• \n169 \n\n• \non having sex before she went therelbefore Joe brought it up?  Did she think \nthe offender might bring sex up? \nAdolescent Grooming Behaviors \nThe goals ofthe offender in grooming an adolescent are the same as when \nan offender grooms a young child--to make sexual assaulting the child \n\"easier\" to do and to get away with. Methods used by offenders with \nadolescents can be the same as some used with smaller children:  exposure \nto ever-increasing physical contact in the context of some initially \n\"innocent\"  play, which serves to blur the place where the line is crossed \n• \nfrom \"innocent\" or 'accidental\" to sexual and purposeful. \nOne might also see the use of \"rewards\" like money, taking the \nadolescent to fun special places, or buying her desired objects. \nWith adolescents, grooming can also include other, more \"mature\" \nrewards, like providing alcohol, drugs or cigarettes, sexy underwear or \nclothes (that the child may have to keep at the offender's home) and viewing \nadult pornography. Other offender grooming strategies specific to \nadolescents include: \n• \n170 \n\n• \n•  Offenders also take advantage of the adolescent's egocentricity \nand desire for independence. They become the \"best friend\" or \nthe adolescent's confidant. They nurture the impression that \nthey really care about the adolescent and plant seeds in the \nadolescent's mind that no one else understand them the way the \noffender does. They are \"always there\" for the victim, often \noffering the chance to get out of the house, to talk, to have \ndinner, a place to crash, etc. for the adolescent. \n• \t Offenders also exploit any troubles (even ordinary issues) the \nadolescent might be experiencing at home and take the \nopportunity to offer exaggerated characterizations of how the \nadolescent's parents really don't understand, don't care, or are \nbad parents.  If any ofthese things happens to be true, it works \nto the offender's advantage even more. \n• \n • \t Offenders will often play to the adolescent's desire to be \nconsidered competent and \"adult.\"  They may foster the belief \nthat the adolescent doesn't need to be at home, doesn't need \nparents.  They may encourage runaway behavior. \n• \t Offenders will often compliment adolescents on their adult \nappearance, which the offender can easily manipulate into \nphysical actions that flatter the adolescent.  These compliments \nmay make the adolescent uncomfortable, or the adolescent may \ntolerate these advances because of all the perks the offender \noffers. \n• \t Sometimes the offender will characterize the relationship with \nthe adolescent as an \"affair\" and introduce sexual behavior with \nthe adolescent as though the adolescent is an equal partner.  To \nthe extent that the adolescent goes along with, or even enjoys, \nthe sexual activity, then the offender can point out that the \n•  adolescent \"wanted it\" or that the adolescent even \"initiated it.\" \nThe offender will make the adolescent feel responsible by \n171 \n\n•\nsaying they \"can't control themselves\" because ofthe \nadolescent's \"sexiness\" or their \"affection/love\" for the \nadolescent. \n• \t Adolescents can also be \"seduced' by the prospect of making \nmoney in exchange for sexual pictures, films, or acts. \nOffenders pose as photographers who set up appointments to \nphotograph girls in sexy clothes.  These operators easily \nintroduce sexy underwear, then require removal of some or all \nof the clothes.  They may convince groups of girls to \nparticipate, even getting them to pose in lewd or sexually \nsuggestive ways with each other, or to even engage in sexual \ncontact or sexual intercourse which he photos or films.  An \noffender may commit sexual assaults during or after the \nfilming, under the guise ofhis role as the photographer having \nbeen \"seduced\" by the adolescent. \n• \nAs one can see, there are a number ofways that many ofthese \ngrooming techniques can be corroborated--which can offer powerful \nevidence of mental state and may \ntr,~atetrteh~.ik~.n.'o·'.d.UO''m\"'l~n~;  H{~~i,\"\n,'Of\n,..&  ~~ '.  _  _  u'  h}§?/c\"  provide a basis for additional crimes. \ntechniqli~S:f,;4l!bi!;~>%';~~,:::' \n-<~:, ~  ';,,-,:'.,-<>.-, \nWhenever there is any sort of \nDll \n: slat  \"relationship\" or longer-term contact \n, 7Dr  \"crimesL;;  . \n\nWhflnever thttre is anisDrt 'Of \n between the offender and the \n:~!relaii'onshiD'!

This is \ntrue even ifthe minor \"consents.\" \nWhen an adolescent is \"willingly\" engaging in sexual behavior with \nan adult, several factors must be taken into account: \n• \t What is the age difference between the victim and the offender \nand what is the relationship between them?  If they are \nlegitimately \"boyfriend/girlfriend\" and are close in age, it may \nbe more equitable to consider issuance of a lesser charge, or the \n• \n\nuse of a deferred prosecution or diversion agreement, or to keep \nthe case in Youth Court.  In addition to the equities, issuance of \nharsher charges may be viewed as unwarranted or unfair by a \njury, who may sympathize with the defendant, or ruminate \nabout how his life will be ruined by conviction for the greater \ncharge, even if the facts support it. \n• \t What are your prosecution goals?  This is often determined, in \npart, by not only the age difference, but the nature of the acts, \nwhether there were other types of crimes involved, whether \nthere was manipulation of the younger victim, or whether \npregnancy or an STD was involved. \n• \t What are the victim's and his/her family's wishes? \n• \t How will the prosecution impact the victim?  Is there any \npotential that she will respond to the filing of charges by \n• \t\nrunning away or otherwise engaging in high risk behaviors? \n173 \n\nEven ifthere is potential for this, there may be significant  • \ncommunity interests in prosecution.  These interests should be \ncommunicated to the victim. \n• \t What is the defendant's history?  Is this his first run-in with the \nsystem or is he always having sex with the young neighborhood \ngirls? \n• \t What are the personal characteristics of your victim?  Is she \naverage or does she have special needs?  Is she vulnerable for \nsome other reason? \n• \t Was this truly \"willing\" on the victim's part or more the \nproduct of subtle coercion or pressure that she was not able to \novercome? \nIn cases where the adult offender is significantly older than the victim,  • \nthe fact that the victim and the defendant are not on the same playing field is \neasier for a jury to see and there is less sympathy for the older adult than to \nthe victim.  In these cases, it is still important to develop the idea that \n\"statutory rape\" is part of our law, and it's there for a reason.  This \ndiscussion should help weed out those who simply cannot put aside the \n\"consent\" issue, and should further help in getting the jurors to focus on the \nelements of the crime. \nIt is often the case that the adolescent believes that he/she is \"in love\" \n• \nwith the offender, that they have a \"relationship\" and that the offender really \n174 \n\n• \nloves them, too. This comes, of course, from what they have been told by the \noffender. Adolescents can believe this after only a very short time ofbeing \ninvolved with the offender. \nIn cases like this, the adolescent usually feels very guilty about having \ndisclosed the sex (if they have disclosed it at all) and especially guilty about \nthe fact that charges may be or have been issued.  Often the disclosure is to a \nfriend, who then disclosed to an adult who contacted parents or police.  This \nadolescent accepts all blame and responsibility and will be heavily invested \nin reminding you and the court that they wanted to do this, that the offender \n• \ndid not do anything wrong, and that they do not want any bad consequences \nto befall the offender. \nIn addition, the adolescent may \nAn \ndecide to foil prosecution efforts by being \nuncooperative, running away, or refusing to \ncooperate with the prosecution. She may \nr~fnindihgyou \n~4urtthat they \npersist in the belief that the defendant is \nt!~:tlds, th~tthe . \nplanning to marry them.  She may have  4i1lnot do allythiirg \n~r~ng,:alld that tl.tty dQ' \neven been trying to get pregnant, to forge an  nOJ;'t[ant~n;IYad. \n(!~.  \". ····ent;esto hefall' \n• \neven stronger bond between themselves and \nthl~';'ff;kd~~\";+~\\'7: \n175 \n\nthe offender.  Adolescents often do not engage in safe sex for this reason.  • \nOffenders know that if they continue to keep in contact with an \nadolescent, by writing letters, placing calls and making arrangements to \nmeet, they can manipulate the adolescent to their advantage.  No contact \norders are important, as well as surveillance efforts to try to prevent \ncontinued manipulation. \nThe victim, too, may initiate contact with the defendant.  It would be \nentirely predictable ifhe/she were to contact the offender by phone or mail, \nor even go visit him/her in the jail. \n• \nThese cases require continued and steady attention to the adolescent's \nmedical and emotional needs.  Adolescents with lower self-esteem seem to \nbe especially vulnerable to oaths of love and promises of a future. The loss \nof that attention--whether because the offender is taken out of the picture, or \nthe offender shows his true colors somehow to the victim--can result in self­\ndestructive behaviors by the adolescent. \nthes~~ases require \ncontinued and \nPredatory Use o/the Internet \nsteady  to \na~ention \nthe. adolescent's.· \nnfedical  In the broadest sense, the Internet intersects \n... \n ltnJotiiilt'alheeds.··· \n,',,><- '\"\", cc'\";:;  c  ,  with sex crimes against adolescents in two ways:  • \n176 \n\n• \n(a) it is used to commit crimes; and (b) it is used by offenders to prejudice \nthe community's view of the adolescent victim. \nWhen used to commit crimes, the Internet can be used by offenders in \nmultiple ways, including meeting in chat rooms, connecting with an \nadolescent using social networking sites such as Facebook or other social \nmedia, and continuing to have inappropriate contact via instant messages \nand texting. \nOffenders may pretend to be a child themselves, or they may identify \nthemselves as an adult.  They introduce topics of sex and are extremely \n• \ngraphic in these discussions, which can be very enticing to the adolescent \nthat sees herself as older, wiser and more mature than her years.  Offenders \nplay on these feelings.  They may exchange pornographic photos with the \nchild, or may convince an adolescent to take photos of herself and send it to \nthe offender.  They may convince an adolescent to actually meet them for \nthe purpose of engaging in sexual behaviors together.  They use many of the \ngrooming techniques described above in convincing an adolescent to \nbecome involved. \n• \n177 \n\nOffenders are also adept at finding out personal information about  • \nadolescents, which they can use either to locate the adolescent, or to further \nmanipulate the adolescent to engage in illegal behavior. \nUsing the Internet to Discredit the Adolescent \nThe Internet is also a very handy tool for offenders who want to ruin \nthe character of the adolescent, to tum community sentiment against the \nadolescent and to try to fatally damage a prosecution involving the \nadolescent.  Adolescents have been known to put compromising photos of \nthemselves onto the internet, thinking it's funny, cute or sexy.  They may \nalso engage in vulgar, sexually explicit conversations or make those types of  • \nstatements putting them onto Facebook or other social media.  Of course, \nonce these materials are out there, it is publicly consumable, and offenders \n(and often defense attorneys) will try to use this material to suggest that the \nadolescent \"wanted it\" or that the adolescent \"victimized\" the offender. \nOffenders or their supporters may publish these materials via news media, or \nby sending it on to others in the community, including the victim's peers. \nThis kind of campaign can devastate a victim, as well as a prosecution, by \ndamaging the victim's credibility and permanently silencing her. \n• \n178 \n\n• \nProsecutors should be honest with adolescent victims about what \nwould be found if someone went into his/her Facebook or other social media \naccounts, and learn whether she has ever engaged in sexual conversations \nwith peers or adults.  This will enable prosecutors to engage in damage \ncontrol to the greatest extent possible. \nAside from preventing adolescents from putting things like this out \nthere on the Internet, the prosecutor should also consider motions like Rape \nShield if it appears that an offender may try to attack victim character or \ncredibility through the use ofthese kinds of materials. \n• \n\nMultiple Offenders \nThe issue of multiple offenders arises in several scenarios.  There can \nbe many individuals who are all participating in concert to sexually assault \nan adolescent, as in cases of gang rapes.  There can be cases involving \nindividuals who are each assaulting the adolescent or who are connected \nwith the assault of the adolescent, as in cases of an adolescent prostitution \nring where some ofthe offenders are pimps or pimp helpers and some are \nthe \"customers.\"  And there are cases where the same adolescent is assaulted \nfirst by one person, then later by another, and so on.  Considerations for each \n• \nare discussed below: \n179 \n\n•\nGang Rape Cases \nIn \"gang rape\" cases, the situation is usually one where the adolescent \nhas voluntarily placed him or herself into the situation in the first place. \nOften the adolescent is on the run from home or a placement, or is otherwise \nwhere he/she should not be at a time when he/she should not be there.  The \nadolescent may \"know\"  (as in \"be acquainted with\") one or more of the \nsubjects who ultimately participate in the assault.  Often these situations \ninvolve initial \"cooperation\" of the victim, which frequently becomes less \n\"cooperative\" and more \"I couldn't get away,\" although sometimes there is \n• \n\"cooperation\" throughout the assaults by the victim.  Almost always, the \nvictim was not expecting that he/she would end up having sex with the \nnumber of individuals he/she has sex with.  Challenges in these kinds of \ncases include the following: \n• \t The victim may run away again; \n• \t While the case is pending, the victim may engage in this same \nsort of risky behavior; \n• \t The victim may be or become too emotionally fragile to \nparticipate in the prosecution; \n• \t The victim may have significant psychological issues that have \nled her to be seduced by this kind of encounter; \n• \n180 \n\n• \n•  The victim may not be able to identify by name some or any of \nthe participants, or may only know the nicknames used during \nthe event; \n• \t Often there are multiple acts occurring at the same time, and the \nvictim may not be able to say who did what in what particular \norder; \n• \t Drugs and/or alcohol may have been used by the victim, which \nmight compromise his/her ability to recall things as accurately \nor as completely; \n• \t The adolescent may have difficulty articulating when events got \nout of hand, or when he/she was no longer \"wanting\" to engage \nin sex, but being \"forced\" to do so, and there may be no overt \n\"force\" used of any kind; \n•  Victim demeanor during the assaults, as described by the \n• \noffenders, may be inconsistent with what the community \nexpects a \"victim\" of a \"gang rape\" to look like or do; \n• \t The media may put a spin on the story that is harmful to the \nprosecution ofthe case; \n• \t There may be medical issues of a confidential nature (i.e. HIV \nstatus.). \nKnowing that these challenges may come into play, the best defense is \na good offense.  Recommendations include: \n• \t Plan for the eventuality that you may not have the victim \navailable to testify; \n• \t Have your investigators work hard to get statements from those \ninvolved to try to develop other means of gaining convictions; \n• \n181 \n\n•\n• \t Consider negotiating in exchange for testimony \n• \t Make sure that all witnesses are interviewed and consider \ntaping those interviews; \n• \t Record the victim's statement; \n• \t Secure all physical evidence; \n• \t Determine whether anyone recorded the acts on a cell phone or \nother electronic device. \n• \t Make sure the adolescent is safe and secure.  Protecting hislher \nidentity, making sure therapy is in place and considerations of \nplacement in or out-of-home should be addressed early \n• \t It is important to learn as much as possible about how this \nadolescentbecame involved in this-what was he/she hoping to \ngain from this encounter?  Has this happened before?  What  • \nvictimization issues or other serious concerns are present?  Do \nthese need to be addressed before a jury should the matter get \nthat far?  If they would need to be, would that exposure cause \nproblems for the victim that outweighs the benefits of \nprosecution?  For instance, if your victim is a high school \nstudent who has a serious mental health problem that others do \nnot know about, is it likely that the mental health issue will \nbecome generally known as a result of prosecutions?  Is this \nexposure \"wOlih it\" to the victim, or will it cause more \npsychological damage than is acceptable? \n• \t Consider using expert testimony-about what, and who may be \nable to provide that testimony will come into play in these sorts \nof cases. \n• \n182 \n\n• \nAdolescent Prostitution \nIn cases where an adolescent is exploited by a prostitution scheme, \noffenders include those who set her up into the situation (and are probably \ngetting the money she makes) along with those who are the customers.  Most \nprosecutors would view the pimps as being more culpable than the johns and \nyou may be able to use that to your advantage in getting cooperation from \nthe johns to testify against the pimp. \nThese kinds of cases have many forms of corroborating evidence, due \nto the rise of Internet use. In addition to the more traditional kinds of \n• \n\ncorroboration (hotel receipts, DNA, etc.), you may want to determine \nwhether the pimp has used any media source to advertise.  For instance, \nCraigslist may contain the ads, including photos, of your victim that were \ntaken and then disseminated there by the pimp.  You can get some of this \ninformation from the victim, or possibly the john, or even by generally \nsearching those kinds of sites.  Search warrants should take into account that \nthis media is probably being used. \nChallenges in these cases include, again, that the adolescent is \nprobably a runaway, and may run again.  The adolescent in this case most \n• \nlikely has some significant issues that have led to a \"choice\" on her part of \n183 \n\nthis risky lifestyle.  Being able to understand this adolescent's life and her  • \nchoices is important to overall credibility, and there may also be a need for \nenlightenment via an expert witness.  The adolescent may not view \nhimself/herself as a victim--this may be one in a long series of episodes of \nprostituting that has become a way of life.  In addition, most adolescents in \nthis situation perceive ofthemselves as equivalent to adults, who are making \n\"choices\" and are not being \"forced\" to do this. \nAdolescents with a History of Victimization \nCases involving the adolescent who has been assaulted during the \n•\ncourse ofhis/her life, by more than one individual, are frequent. \nStatistically, a person who has been victimized sexually before is at a greater \nrisk of being assaulted again. \nDefense attorneys may attempt to use past abuse in several ways. \nFirst, they may argue that the victim is \"confusing\" the offender with an old \nabuser and that hislher perceptions can't be trusted.  They may also argue \nthat the victim \"learned\" about abuse via the past acts and that's why they \nare able to describe it now. They may try to paint past abuse as a \"prior false \nallegation\" of sexual assault.  Or, they may argue that the victim is simply \n• \n184 \n\n• \nmaking up the current allegations to get attention, having \"learned\" that they \nget attention through allegations of sexual abuse from the past episode. \nIn cases involving adolescents, arguments that the victim wouldn't \notherwise know about sex but for the past abuse are generally ludicrous \npositions.  Adolescents do know about sex, through school and general \nexposure to life by the time they are adolescents.  \"Confusion\" arguments \nand \"learned attention-getting\" arguments are devices designed to try to \ncircumvent the prohibition in the Rape Shield Law that clearly state that \nother sexual behavior is not admissible. What the defense really wants to do, \n• \n\nin making these arguments, is to muddy the waters and get the jury to focus \non matters other than the defendant's culpability.  These efforts should be \nstrongly rebuffed via the application of the Rape Shield statute. \nWorking with Marginalized Populations \nAs a prosecutor, you want to obtain convictions, make communities safer, \nand increase the safety of sexual assault survivors who are at the center of \nyour case.  In order to accomplish this, it is your responsibility as a \nprosecutor to:  (a) know the make-up of your community; (b) understand the \ndiverse cultures who live within it; (c) understand survivors' issues and the \n• \nchallenges they face in coming forward and in healing; (d) hold offenders \n185 \n\naccountable for crimes against vulnerable populations; and (e) be familiar  • \nwith local resources that are available to support sexual assault survivors in \ntheir efforts to heal from the trauma of sexual assault and seek justice. A \nvictim-centered response to sexual assault also requires that prosecutors \nA/$victim...centere4\nunderstand the strengths, challenges and needs \nre~~~lIsei6j'~ex~tifc~;Z \nof victims who are seeking justice.  .  ass~itlfal~d requir~s that \n; prosecut'Ors understand \nIt is especially critical that prosecutors \nt~l.sttength~, chall~ltg'!j1~ \n(initin~Jit.,'Olvif1i~;iVJilit\nunderstand the needs of marginalized  Ii;; \nflri~eekj~gJu~iice.

Offenders seek them out because they are \nvulnerable and because offenders know that marginalized people will be the \nleast likely to report a sexual assault, and ifthey do, the chances are they \nwon't be believed. \nBarriers t'O Seeking Justice \nMarginalized populations face tremendous, sometimes overwhelming, \nbarriers to seeking justice. These barriers fall under the following themes:  • \n186 \n\n• \n•  Fear of formal systems, including law enforcement and \nprosecution; \n• \t Fear ofrepercussions from within their own communities; \n• \t Cultural myths and beliefs that prevent them from coming \nforward; \n• \t Lack of culturally competent resources to support them in \nseeking justice and healing; \n• \t Accessibility issues (language, social and environmental, etc.); \nAll of these barriers converge to drive the crime of sexual assault \nunderground, keep offenders from being held accountable, and re-victimize \n• \n\nsexual assault survivors who do not have access to justice and healing. \nProsecutors who understand these barriers--and who actively work with \nvictims and advocates to remove victim barriers--will experience increased \nvictim participation in the successful prosecution of sexual assault crimes in \ntheir communities. \nCulture Specific Barriers \nMontana is a vibrant state comprised of richly diverse communities. \nWe are fortunate that so many people of different cultures that have made \nour state their home.  While we enjoy the benefits of having neighbors who \n• \n187 \n\nbring a wealth of diversity to our state, we must also appreciate that they  • \nbring different beliefs and values with them. \nMarginalized populations are not homogenous.  While they do face \nsimilar barriers to seeking justice, they are also unique communities with \ntheir own unique strengths, challenges, and culture-specific needs.  Having \nat least a basic understanding about the cultural differences between these \n.  communities--and how those differences shape \nMaJ~inalized \no \n. pOhulatigns at:~,nqt . \nvictim participation in prosecution--will better \nhomogehous.,·IWhil \nt'\"  equip prosecutors to provide the support and \n,~\"'s; . \n• \nassistance marginalized people need in order to \nthey'll;'e also \n\"''Iique communities \nseek justice. \nwith thdiiiOwn unique \n~f,;engths,. challenges, . \nA full discussion ofthe unique needs \n'~~rd ~Uliure~speciftc1' \n.. \nit~eds:' \nand challenges experienced by marginalized \npopulations is beyond the scope of this document. However, in the interest \nof encouraging prosecutors to learn more, this section will describe some of \nthe most predominant cultures that comprise marginalized populations in \nMontana. It is our hope that this information will educate prosecutors about \nthe values and intricacies of each community, how they respond to sexual \n• \n188 \n\n• \nassault, and encourage prosecutors to show victims that they respect their \nunique cultural difference. \nNative American Women \nNative American Women experience the highest rates of sexual \nassault of any marginalized population--they are 2.5 times more likely to \nexperience sexual assault as other women of color.  One in three Native \nAmerican women has experienced sexual assault in their lives. And 80% of \nthe offenders who prey on them are non-Native American. \n• \n Native American survivors of sexual assault also face tremendous \ncultural barriers to seeking justice.  The Native American culture places a \nhuge emphasis on harmony and getting along.  Most Native American \ncommunities are close knit communities.  Native American victims who \ncome forward therefore risk disrupting the very fabric oftheir community. \nNative American women also stand a high risk of losing their children in \ninstances ofphysical or sexual abuse. \nThey often stay with abusive husbands in order to keep their children. \nF or these reasons, they may be reluctant to report or participate in \nprosecution.  And most never see their cases prosecuted due to the alleged \n• \n189 \n\nconfusion by law enforcement about federal and tribal jurisdictions--when as  • \na matter of fact, these laws are clearly defined. \nThe issue of statutory rape in the Native American community also \npresents a challenge for prosecutors.  Native American women receive \nmixed messages from within their culture. While it is looked down upon by \ntribal elders, there is an unspoken message in some Native American \ncommunities that young Native American women (as young as 15 or 16) \nsomehow caused the sexual assault--and because of this myth it is \nsometimes accepted. \n• \nAfrican-American Women \nIt is important for prosecutors to recognize that many African­\nAmerican view formal systems with suspicion.  They do not believe that \nsystems are there to help them; in fact, many believe that the justice system \nwill fail them.  Many African-American women have had negative \nexperiences with law enforcement or know someone who has. They are also \nkeenly aware that African-American men are disproportionately represented \nin the criminal justice system and they believe that men in their culture are \ntreated unfairly.  For these reasons, some will be reluctant to participate in \n• \nprosecuting an African-American assailant because they won't want to do \n190 \n\n• \nthat to \"one oftheir own.\"  If the offender is kin, they will also resist \nbreaking up the family, subjecting the family to shame, or putting their \nchildren at risk of involvement with the child protective services. \nAfrican-American women also fear that they will not be believed \nsimply because they are women of color.  Rather than seeking justice \nthrough formal systems, African-American women are more likely to seek \nassistance through informal supports--kin, clergy and neighbors.  They also \nface multilayered issues that have a direct effect on their ability to \nparticipate in the prosecution of a crime--poverty, housing, child care, lack \n• \n\nof supportive resources, etc. \nTheir inclination to choose race over gender, and informal systems \nover formal systems, presents a challenge to prosecutors.  But the challenge \ncan be overcome when prosecutors make an effort to acknowledge their lack \nof trust and make an attempt to earn it. \nLatina Women \nLatina women are among the least likely to report a sexual assault. \nLatina survivors face a number of cultural barriers to coming forward-­\nsexual assault and abuse continues to be an \"off-limits\" subject in the Latino \n• \ncommunity.  Deeply held stereotypes in the Latino community make it \n191 \n\ndifficult for women to share a history of sexual violence with their partners  • \nand families.  Survivors fear that coming forward may result in their being \nostracized, labeled as \"damaged goods,\" or even blamed for the assault. \nSome Latino males have an extremely difficult time dealing with the \nsexual assault of a loved one by a stranger, believing that a woman's chastity \nis broken during an assault.  Latina women know this and they may be \nunlikely to report a sexual assault out of fear ofthe long term damage it will \ncreate in her relationship with her male partner.  Latina women are also \nfearful of causing shame to their families and this may present another \n•\nbarrier to participating in prosecution. \nLatina women are also fearful of formal systems.  Like African \nAmerican women, many have experienced unequal treatment by law \nenforcement, health care and other systems that are supposed to protect \nthem. \nMany believe they will not be treated fairly or will be subject to \nbrutality. They are more likely to seek help through informal supports like \nclergy. \n• \n192 \n\n• \nThe lack of bilingual service providers, support systems and sexual \nassault providers in many communities also presents a challenge for Latino \nwomen--making it even more difficult for survivors to seek help. \nUndocumented Women \nUndocumented women are among the marginalized groups who are \nthe least likely to seek justice.  The primary reasons for this are a belief that \njustice is not available to them and a fear of retribution and deportation by \nlaw enforcement. This distrust oflaw enforcement and prosecution often \nfollows them from their countries of origin where the law enforcement and \n• \n\njustice systems are viewed as opportunistic, corrupt and not helpful to \nvictims of crime. \nUndocumented victims also fear retaliation from the offender, who is \nlikely to have threatened to have them deported if they report the crime. Like \nmany women of color, they fear not being believed.  They also fear that their \nown community will not support them or will tum against them to side with \nthe offender -particularly if the offender is also undocumented.  The power \nimbalance in these types of relationships always favors the person with \ndocumentation . \n• \n193 \n\n---------------------------------------------, \n• \nFinally, given the current political climate in the U.S., many \nundocumented women fear drawing any attention at all to the undocumented \ncommunity at all. For this reason, many victims will put the needs of the \ncommunity before their own. \nHmongWomen \nThe most important social structure in the Hmong community is the \nHmong kinship, defined by blood relationships or clans. There are about \ntwenty Hmong clans (\"xeem\") in the world.  Clan membership comes \nthrough birth, marriage, or adoption. All children acquire membership into \nthe father's clan group at their birth.  Women acquire the clan membership  • \noftheir husbands upon their marriage.  All Hmong cultural norms are \ndictated by the beliefs oftheir clan. \nHmong victims of sexual assault face tremendous cultural barriers. It \nis important to note that in the Hmong language there are no words \nequivalent to \"rape\" or \"sexual assault.\"  Hmong women who are sexually \nassaulted do not even have the language to describe their experience within \ntheir own culture. \n• \n194 \n\n• \nWhen a Hmong woman is sexually assaulted, she is expected to seek \nhelp of the clan leader and not involve outsiders.  All problems are to be \nresolved within the clan.  Because the clan system is driven by male \nprivilege, wives are viewed as possessions.  Hence, a wife cannot claim to \nhave been sexually assaulted by her husband. She is expected to have sex \nwith him is part of her \"duty\" --whether she wants sex or not.  If a Hmong \nwoman charges her husband with sexual assault, she will likely face scorn \nfrom her own community who will take the position that he is her husband \nand she is supposed to have sex with him. If a woman is disowned from her \n• \n husband's clan, she will be forced to return to her clan of origin, where she \nmay also be disowned.  Thus, if a Hmong woman reports a sexual assault \nshe risks losing all connections to family. \nHmong families will preserve clan dignity and avoid shame at all \ncosts. If a Hmong woman is sexually harassed or fondled against her will, \nshe is expected to accept this violation.  Otherwise her family might \nminimize it or claim that she brought it on herself.  Hmong women who are \nsexually assaulted by a stranger are often expected to marry the offender so \nas not to shame their family.  The message Hmong women receive is that if \nyou are sexually assaulted it is your fault. \n• \n195 \n\n• \nInternational marriages present another challenge for prosecutors.  It \nis not an uncommon practice for a married Hmong man to travel to Laos to \nmarry a second wife.  The wife will likely be underage, sometimes as young \nas 11-14 years old.  Hmong men will bring the child back to the U.S. with \npromises of securing her an education and a better life.  Once here, he will \nexpect both \"wives\" to live under the same roof.  This implicit polygamy \noften falls under the radar of formal systems because more often than not, \nthe child comes to the U.S. with a forged birth certificate.  Prosecutors may \nactually encounter cases where a Hmong man is having sex with a minor \nwho lives in his home--tolerated by a wife who has few options.  Prosecutors  • \nmay also have difficulty corroborating the age ofthe child without an \nauthentic birth certificate. \nProsecutors should move cautiously when working with Hmong \nvictims of sexual assault who observe the traditional norms and practices of \ntheir culture, and respect the victim's decision about whether or not to \nparticipate in the investigation and prosecution.  Developing strong ties with \norganizations who provide services to the Hmong community is critical to \nincreasing your understanding about the unique cultural beliefs of this \n• \n196 \n\n• \npopulation, especially in communities where there is a significant Hmong \npresence. \nJustice-Involved Women \nPoverty, trauma, substance abuse and abusive relationships with men \nare the primary pathways for women into \nthe criminal justice system.  Research has  ; ::;,,,' ~C\\!*0~<%\\~t;'.~  .. \n:lu~mll; \n~bu~ell~~; .. \nshown that approximately 90% ofjustice-\ninvolved women have experienced repeated \nsexual assaults and abuse throughout their \n• \nlives.  The trauma of abuse not only shapes \ntheir lives, it also creates a mistrust of law \nenforcement, and prosecutors, and most \nformal systems, formal systems have failed \nthem.  Formal systems have put them in jail. \nFormal systems have returned them to their communities upon their release \nwith few resources to help them escape the cycle of poverty and abuse that \nput them there in the first place.  Justice involved women are more likely to \nhave been involved in the sex trade industry at some point in their lives.  For \n• \nthis reason they fear they won't be believed or treated fairly ifthey are \n197 \n\n• \nsexually assaulted.  They also face tremendous challenges when they return \nto their communities: finding a safe place to live, securing employment, and \nreunifying with their children.  These priorities will often trump any desire \nthey have to seek justice for a sexual assault committed against them. \nIt is important for prosecutors to educate juries that just because a \nwoman has committed a crime it doesn't mean that she is not a victim of \nsexual assault. \nLGBTQ Populations \nLGBTQ people (Lesbian, Gay, \n• \nBisexual, Transgender and Questioning) are \nsubject to the same spectrum of sexual \nviolence as the general population.  In fact, according to many statistics, they \nare subject to more.  Approximately 10% ofhate crimes against gay men \nand lesbians include sexual assault.  This percentage may be higher, since it \nis sometimes difficult for lesbians to discern whether they were attacked \nbecause ofbeing identified as a lesbian or as a woman.  In a study of 162 \ngay men and 111 lesbians, 52% reported at least one incident of sexual \ncoercion by same-sex partners.  Gay men experienced 1.6 incidents per \n• \nperson; while lesbians experienced 1.2 incidents per person.\"  In a survey of \n198 \n\n• \n412 university students, 42% ofLGBTQ students indicated they had been \nforced to have sex against their will compared to 21 % of heterosexual \nstudents. \" \nUnfortunately, LGBTQ people may also face further victimization \nwhen dealing with sexual violence.  Often an offender will use \nhomophobialheterosexism as a weapon to threaten victims.  Their tactics \ninclude suggesting that: \n• \t No help is available because the police/justice system is \nhomophobic. \n• \n\n• \t The victim/survivor will not be believed because LGBTQ \npeople do not sexually assault. \n• \t LGBTQ people deserve to be sexually assaulted for being \nLGBTQ. \n• \t The victim/survivor will be \"outed\" or threatened with being \nouted to friends, family, employer, police, church, or others if \nthe victim/survivor reports a sexual assault experience. \nBecause of this, LGBTQ victims may not come forward.  They may \nalso fear that they are betraying their close knit LGBTQ community, which \nis already under attack, by \"accusing\" another LGBTQ person of sexual \n• \nassault.  Some LGBTQ victims may fear that they are exposing their \n199 \n\n• \nassailant to a homophobic criminal justice system if they pursue a legal \nsolution.  Most importantly, many fear that they have nowhere to tum for \nhelp because they expect hostile and homophobic responses from the police, \ncourts, and service providers. \nVictims ofHuman Trafficking \nHuman trafficking is a complex social and legal problem that requires \nspecialized attention from prosecutors.  Human trafficking is modem day \nslavery. Article # 3 ofthe 2000 UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children defines \nhuman trafficking as: \"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or  • \nreceipt ofpersons, by means ofthe threat or use of force or other forms of \ncoercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, ofthe abuse ofpower or of a \nposition of vulnerability or ofthe giving or receiving ofpayments or benefits \nto achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the \npurpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the \nexploitation ofthe prostitution of others or other forms of sexual \nexploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, \nservitude or the removal of organs.\" \n• \n200 \n\n• \nUS Federal Legislation addressing human trafficking, the TVPA   ­\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act passed in 2000 (reauthorized in 2003, \n2005 and 2009), is grounded in this international law. \nA full discussion of the needs of human trafficking victims is beyond \nthe scope of this document.  However, the crime ofhuman trafficking does \nintersect with sexual assault because victims oftrafficking are often \nsubjected to sexual assault, torture and other inhumane treatment by their \ntraffickers. While trafficking affects men, women and children of all ages, \nraces and social standings, populations \n•  most vulnerable to trafficking are \nimpoverished women and children. \nHuman trafficking includes labor, sex \n1'osecutorSl.·• ..... \nand other forms of exploitation, and \nthey often overlap (e.g. labor trafficking cases with sex component). Victims \nu.s. \ninclude foreign nationals and  citizens (often referred to as victims of \ninternational and domestic trafficking). The crime may originate in Montana, \nin a different state or in another country, and can occur in urban and rural \n• \n201 \n\nsettings, especially large farming communities.  Offenders may be part of an  • \norganized crime group or act on their own. \nOne ofthe greatest challenges of addressing human trafficking is that \nit is a hidden crime.  Prosecutors may encounter victims of sexual assault \nwho are also victims of human trafficking. \nUnfortunately, identifying victims of human \ntrafficking is a challenge, because \ntraffickers are experts at controlling victims \nand coaching them about how to respond to \n• \nquestions.  In most cases trafficking victims \nque~  es.? \n!ir~.fJic  .victit.  \"ill;\" ;<~ \nwill not self-identify--in fact, they may not \nn6tself-itlentify--infa~t;·· \nthey rna}' n()t,qntle~stand \nunderstand what the term \"trafficking\" \n,'~.~~.:: i  ,<- :~ ~ ,  ,  ' \nmeans, or even view themselves as a victim.  ..\"  mean~~.a· \n~~~n vi~ themsel~J~~$·· \nThere are a number of \"red flags\" that  a victim. \nmay indicate a sexual assault victim is also a victim ofhuman trafficking: \n• \t Is anyone forcing the victim to do anything that they do not \nwant to do? \n• \t Can the victim leave their situation and/or job ifthey want? \n• \n202 \n\n• \n•  Has the victim been physically harmed in any way or \nthreatened? \n• \t Has the victim been recruited \nfor one purpose and forced to \ndo some other job? \n• \t Is the victim's salary being \ngarnished? \nrat  \"om~Ii;)i,ith(Jut \n• \t Was the victim forced to  9il~f(kilides. >.<,~< \nperform sexual acts? \n• \t Is the victim a juvenile engaged in commercial sex? \n• \t Has the victim been harmed or deprived of food, water, sleep, \nmedical care, or other life necessities? \n• \t\n•  Can the victim freely contact friends or family? \n• \t Has the victim or family been threatened with harm if she \nattempts to escape? \n• \t Is the victim allowed to socialize or attend religious services? \n• \t Was the victim coached on what to say to law enforcement or \nimmigration officials? \n• \t Is the victim in possession of identification and travel \ndocuments; ifnot, who has control of those documents? \n• \t Has the victim been threatened with deportation or other law \nenforcement action? \nProsecutors are uniquely positioned to identify victims of human \n• \ntrafficking and support them in seeking justice and restoration of their \n203 \n\nhuman rights. Prosecutors who are working with a sexual assault victim who  • \nthey suspect may also be a victim of human trafficking should familiarize \nthemselves with federal and state efforts to address the issue. \nVictims with Cognitive or Developmental Disabilities \nHistorically, people with disabilities have experienced discrimination \nbecause oftheir disabilities.  They have been viewed as incapable or \nhelpless, separated from society at large, and denied opportunities for \neducation and other life experiences.  Misperceptions and stereotypes about \npeople with disabilities--and a subsequent history of oppression--put people \n• \nwith disabilities at increased risk to experience sexual assault. \nStatistics indicate that women with developmental disabilities are \nsexually assaulted at twice the rate ofwomen without disabilities. \nAccording to one study, 90% ofpeople with developmental disabilities will \nexperience sexual abuse at some point in their lives and 49% ofthem will \nexperience 10 or more abusive incidents.  Only 3% of sexual abuse cases \ninvolving people with developmental disabilities are ever reported.\"  Of that \n3%, only 22% ofthe offenders are charged and only 8.5% are convicted. \n•  In a 1991 study by Sobsey and Doe they estimate that more \n• \nthan half ofthe abuse perpetrated against people with \n204 \n\n• \ndisabilities is generally by family members and peers with \ndisabilities, and that disability professionals (i.e., paid or unpaid \ncaregivers, doctors, nurses) are generally believed to be \nresponsible for the other half. \n• \t There are few studies that document sexual assault against \nwomen with physical and/or sensory disabilities, but Young, \nM.E., et al. reported that 40% of women with physical \ndisabilities reported being sexually assaulted. \nIt is critically important to remember that sexual offenders \ndeliberately seek out individuals they perceive to be vulnerable and those \nthey believe may be easier to manipulate, control, and groom for the sexual \n• \n\nabuse.  Offenders target people with disabilities because they think they will \nbe able to get away with abusing a victim who may be unable to \ncommunicate what has happened to them and who is unlikely to be believed \neven ifthey are able to disclose.  In addition, people with disabilities are \noften isolated from services and supports and denied education about sexual \nabuse.  As a result, individuals may have no one to disclose the abuse to, \nand/or may not understand that what happened to them is abusive. \n• \n205 \n\nMany people within the society at large, as well as people within the  • \ncriminal justice system have preconceived notions about who are the victims \nof sexual assault; generally speaking most people do not think ofpeople \nwith disabilities as potential or likely victims of sexual crimes. Some of the \ncommon myths are about this population are:  (a) that they are oversexed; \n(b) they  are grateful for any sexual attention; (c) they are too undesirable to \nbe targeted for sexual abuse; and (d) they are unreliable, lie and are more \nprone to fantasizing.  It is important to address \nDesoitetneilisturbing,...  these preconceived ideas and myths with \nfr~~~ency ofsexual  . \njuries when prosecuting a case with a victim  • \nas;saults (lg~instoe~ule \n\nJvi1~dis_l?:iliti¢~;Jiijijitl, ,i \n\n:1:  with disabilities. \noffend~;;kt~;~l!iti~..... \naccountable., \nDespite the disturbing frequency of \nsexual assaults against people with disabilities, few offenders are held \naccountable.  There are numerous reasons for this.  Some victims with \ndisabilities may not report the assault because they are not aware that the \nexperience was abusive.  Some may not report because they fear reprisal \nfrom the offender, fear they won't be believed, or are afraid of entering the \nlegal system. Barriers related to communication and accessibility may also \nprevent victims from reporting the assault. Additionally, some prosecutors \n• \n206 \n\n• \nmay believe that juries will not perceive individuals with disabilities as \ncredible witnesses; therefore, they may choose not to prosecute.  Prosecutors \nmay also aim for plea agreements (which often come with lesser sentences) \nas a means of \"protecting\" victims with disabilities from jury trials. \nAs with any victim who reports, navigating the legal system and \nretelling the details of the assault can be \nSystelnsofteir/ocuson \n\ntraumatic.  Advocates can help minimize the \nwhat':the:p \"'\",,,I,.1Ii \npossibility of further trauma by providing  with r.,1,i~~\" !1!JelrsOJ \nsupport to victims who are coping with an \n• \nassault and facing the prospect of potentially \nlengthy or emotional court procedures. \nVictims with Mental Health Problems  \"  ' \nheo\"lth Pfobletns, as a \nPrevious sections have discussed the  f~~j.ltojeiIo~ts to~ope ' \nwitn·a'si~';alassault. \nimpact of sexual trauma on victim's mental \ns tl,at overlookthe \n,  needs o/victikis)~ \nhealth.

In addition, individuals with \ntrauma related mental health issues are targeted for repeat assaults. \n• \t A 200 I study found that women with a psychiatric disability had a \n\nhigh rate of sexual victimization.  They also found that 74% of \n\nwomen with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse related \n\nproblems have histories of sexual abuse.\" \n\n• \t Another study found that the lifetime risk for violent victimization \nwas so high for homeless women with severe mental illness (97%) as \nto amount to normative experiences for this population.\"  • \n• \t For individuals with psychiatric disabilities, the rate ofviolent \n\ncriminal victimization including sexual assault was 2 times greater \n\nthan in the general population (8.2% vs. 3.1 %) \n\nThe stigma associated with mental illnesses and difficulty survivors \nhave finding trauma-informed services and supports can have a profound \neffect on individuals.  Systems often focus on what they think is wrong with \nthe person instead of what has happened to them.  As a result, victims with \nmental illness may develop alcohol and other drug problems, eating \ndisorders, and other health problems, as a result of efforts to cope with a \n• \n208 \n\n• \nsexual assault. Systems that overlook the holistic needs ofvictims will tend \nto see individuals as problematic, hopeless, and/or lacking credibility. \nPeople with mental illnesses face many barriers to reporting a sexual \nassault.  These include fears that they will not be believed, fears that people \nwill think they \"made up\" the sexual assault because of their illness, and \nfears about having their mental illness revealed to their families and \ncommunity. Cases involving victims with a mental health diagnosis may be \ndropped because of assumptions that evidence will not be considered \nreliable.  Mental health issues may also be used to discredit victims, no \n• \n\nmatter how far in the past it occurred.  Some victims with serious and \npersistent mental illness may also be so overwhelmed by the assault that \nthey can't imagine coping with the stress of a trial.  For victims with mental \nillness, the assault often exacerbates their symptoms of anxiety, depression, \nworthlessness and hopelessness.  For these reasons, victims with mental \nillnesses may not believe they are even worthy ofjustice.  Or, they may \nmake their healing from the assault a necessary priority over justice. \nTherefore, it is important that victims feel supported by trauma informed \nadvocates and prosecutors in order to overcome many of these barriers. \n• \n\nConsiderations in Working with Marginalized Populations \n\n209 \n\n• \nAn understanding and appreciation of the unique world view of \nmarginalized populations can guide prosecutors in their interactions with \nunderserved victims and provide the support and encouragement that \nmarginalized people need to seek justice.  Strategies that prosecutors can use \nto increase their own cultural competency include: \n• \t Practice vertical prosecution whenever possible. It will help you \ngain and retain the trust of marginalized victims. \n• \t Remember that trust is not a given. It must be earned. \n• \t Listen and don't judge. \n• \n• \t Acknowledge the injustice that marginalized people have \nexperienced in their lives. \n• \t Learn key phrases in other languages.  It is not necessary to \nspeak fluently.  However a few common phrases like \"I'm \nsorry,\" Thank you\" and \"'You are courageous\" \"I believe you,\" \nwill help to build rapport with non-English speaking people. \nThis genuine gesture will also go a long way to demonstrate \nyour compassion and respect. \n• \t Increase your visibility within communities of color.  Attend \ncultural events in your community where marginalized people \ngather. \n• \t Know your community and reach out to community-based \nagencies and resources that support specific cultures and \npopulations. \n• \n210 \n\n• \n•  Seek to increase your knowledge about marginalized \npopulations by reaching out to advocates and/or agencies that \nreach communities of color for guidance. \n•  Understand that communities of color are small and because of \nthis they are interconnected.  Be cautious to use interpreters \nwho are independent and not connected to the victim's \nimmediate family, friends or distant relatives. \n•  Coordinate interviews with victims to include advocates from \nwithin the victim's community. \nA.cuf:r;~tjt orfo  . \n•  Seek to increase diversity in your \n.~,~ \nstaff.

Despite \nthis fact, the public still expects offenders to be weapon-wielding strangers \nwho attack their victims in dark alleys. \nThis expectation, grounded in cultural bias, victim blaming, rape myth \nacceptance, and faulty expectations about victim behavior, creates unique \nchallenges to the successful prosecution of non-stranger sexual assault.)  A \ncurrent or former relationship between the victim and the defendant can lead \nto additional complexities that often make the arrest, prosecution, and \n•\nconviction of an intimate partner offender even more difficult. \nHistorically, additional barriers to prosecution were created by \nexempting spouses from the rape statutes.  Although the marital exemption \nis no longer codified, some allied criminal justice professionals have \ncontinued to ignore, dismiss, or blame victims of intimate partner sexual \nassault.  A growing number of allied criminal justice professionals recognize \nthe validity of intimate partner sexual violence and conduct aggressive \ninvestigations and prosecutions of these offenders.  Despite their efforts, \nhowever, jurors and judges often fail to hold intimate partner offenders \naccountable.  • \n212 \n\n• \nThe criminal justice system is a critical piece of the coordinated \nresponse to sexual violence.  If its response is indifferent or ineffective, \nsexual violence victims are left vulnerable, offenders are not held \naccountable, communities are less safe, and justice system's response to \nsexual violence, allied criminal justice professionals must recognize the \nserious impact of intimate partner sexual assault on the victim as well as the \ncommunity, understand the contexts in which \nTI.~ie is'a pervasive iilea} \ntna/in-nome  .  ..  .. \nintimate partner sexual assaults occur, and \nappreciate the individual responses that victims \n•  of intimate partner sexual assaults have to their \nvictimization.

Offenders of intimate partner \nsexual assault violate their victims physically and emotionally.

Prosecutors must determine the context in which a violent \n215 \n\nincident occurs in order to accurately analyze, charge, try, and dispose ofthe  • \ncase.  Significantly, not all intimate partner assaults occur in the same \ncontext. \nOffenders do not sexually assault out of sexual desire ofto achieve \nsexual satisfactions.  Rather, sexual assault is about power, and, therefore, \nsex is a weapon and a means of expressing the offender's aggression or \npower.  Although some intimate partner assailants limit their violence to \nsexual assault, the majority of intimate partner sexual assaults occur within a \nphysically abusive relationship.  As a result, many intimate partner sexual \n• \nassaults also involve domestic violence dynamics.  All violent relationships \ninclude some level of control or attempt on the batterer's part to control his \npartner.  Some relationships may include a cycle ofviolence.  The term \n\"cycle of violence\" was developed by Lenore Walker to describe three \ndistinct phases in an abusive relationship:  tension building, physical abuse, \nand the honeymoon phase.  Prosecutors must understand, however, that \nalthough these theories are helpful in understanding domestic violence, not \nevery relationship involves a cycle ofviolence or the dynamics featured in \nthe Power and Control Wheel.  Domestic violence exists on a continuum, \nand, therefore, most relationships exist at some place--or in many places-­\n• \n216 \n\n• \nalong the continuum, is critical that prosecutors understand the dynamics of \neach relationship in which an intimate partner assault occurs in order to \naccurately evaluate and prosecute the case. \nCommon Domestic and Sexual Violence Victim Behaviors \nDespite the extent ofthe research on domestic and sexual violence, \nmany jurors still believe stereotypes about sexual \nVictim:sofintintate \nand domestic violence victim behavior.  For  eartnersf!Xual assault: \nlI,wy exliilJitmallyofthe' \nhehaviorstlescribed  . \nexample, jurors expect domestic violence victims \nabove. Til' \nto accept responsibility and leave batterers.

For example, the public expects sexual \nassault victims to scream during their sexual assault, to forcefully resist their \nattackers, to report their sexual assaults immediately, to remain vigilant \nfollowing their attacks, and to avoid their assailants.  Sexual assault victims, \nhowever, often do not scream or resist during a sexual assault; they \nfrequently delay reporting their sexual assault; they often do not remain \nhypervigilant; and they may continue to have contact with their assailant. \nVictims of intimate partner sexual assault may exhibit many of the behaviors  • \ndescribed above.  Specifically, they may vacillate in their cooperation with \nthe prosecution, recant, or testify on the defendant's behalf.  They may also \n\"consent\" to sexual activity with their assailant at some point following their \nassault.  The behaviors create significant difficulties in the prosecution ofan \nintimate partner assailant and require explanations by the victim or an \nexpert. \nOvercoming Obstacles to the Successful Prosecution ofIntimate Partner \nSexual Assault \n• \n218 \n\n• \nThe prevalence of myths surrounding sexual and domestic violence \ncreates significant barriers to the successful prosecution of intimate partner \nsexual assault, but prosecutors can take steps to overcome them. \nSince many offenders of intimate partner sexual assault use sexual \nviolence in the context of a physically violent relationship, many victims \nface collateral consequences relevant to domestic assault.  Therefore, \nprosecutors must approach intimate partner sexual assaults in a \nmultidisciplinary manner.  Unlike a victim of a random crime, a domestic \nviolence victim's involvement with the criminal justice system may put her \n• \n\nat risk of: losing her housing (ifher abuser is the primary household wage­\nearner); losing her employment (if she repeatedly misses work in order to \nattend the numerous court appearances that may accompany the criminal and \ncivil hearings related to her abuse); losing custody ofher children (if the \nstate feels she is unable to protect or provide for her children); losing \nfinancial support for herself and her children (if her abuser loses his job once \nhe is convicted or sent to prison); losing her immigration status (if she is \nunable to qualify for a visa under VAWA provisions); and being prosecuted \n(if her attempts to protect herself or her children are not recognized as self­\ndefense).  In addition, as discussed earlier in this article, victims of intimate \n• \n219 \n\npartner sexual assault feel a deep sense ofbetrayal over their assaults.  They  • \nalso engage in self-blame. \nProsecutors must identify and form relationships with community \nadvocates and agencies to address and attempt to resolve the collateral \nproblems domestic violence victims face as a result of their abuse and to \naddress the emotional distress caused by the assault.  Prosecutors alone are \nnot able to provide victims with the attention, advocacy, and resources \nrequired to address and resolve the victim's needs.  By working with \ncommunity advocates, prosecutors can help victims procure counseling, \n• \ncreate a safety plan, obtain assistance with childcare, secure or maintain \nhousing, and receive vocational training or assistance with a current \nemployer. \n. \nT11'itntrQ~lJ~tionoi:; \nProsecutors can explain the context of \nother (.lets' Ctllt;' . \ndemonstrate.i,:l3£11;.  ~ \nan intimate partner sexual assault by \ndefl~ntlaq~~lntent':~ith \nintroducing evidence of an assailant's other  respe(:~lt;the i1':#mate i \nparlne~;;'exual{tss'fltJ1t \nbad acts.

If the victim has been previously abused by \nher partner, her perception ofher batterer's ability to cause her imminent \nharm, even where there has been a passage of time between her batterer's \nthreat and the sexual assault is well-grounded.  Domestic violence victims' \nexperience of the repeated violent cycles enable them to predict their \npartner's impending violence based upon his behavior preceding previous \nassaults ofthe victim.  Therefore, evidence of the defendant's victimization \nby the batterer and the cyclical nature of her relationship is relevant and may \n• \n be admissible establish that the victim's fear is reasonable and well­\ngrounded. \nFinally prosecutors must understand the impacts of a victim's lack of \ncooperation, and the impact of Crawford v.  Washington and Davis v. \nWashington on their ability to prosecute an intimate partner sexual assault. \nA prosecutor will rarely be able to successfully prosecute an intimate partner \nsexual assault of competent adult victim without the victim's cooperation \nbecause of the difficulty in overcoming the consent defense. \nIn the rare instance where an intimate partner sexual assault of a \n•  competent adult without the victim's cooperation is prosecuted, prosecutors \n221 \n\nmust anticipate defense objections to the introduction of hearsay as well as  • \nany \"testimonial\" statements under Crawford and Davis.  Crawford held that \ntestimonial statement of an unavailable witness can be admitted at trial only \nwhen the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine that \nwitness.  This holding was clarified in Davis, in which the Court explained \nthat statements made to government agents for the primary purpose of \nreceiving assistance in an ongoing emergency are non-testimonial. \nStatements are testimonial when circumstances objectively indicate there is \nno ongoing emergency and the primary purpose of the interrogation is to \nestablish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal  • \nprosecution. \nIntimate partner sexual assaults pose significant challenges for \nprosecutors.  In order to successfully prosecute these cases, prosecutors must \novercome cultural bias, victim blaming, and domestic and sexual violence \nmyth acceptance.  Further, they must persuade judges and juries that \nintimate partner sexual assaults are serious cases that significantly impact \nthe safety and well-being ofthe community.  Prosecutors can debunk \nprevailing myths by understanding and explaining sexual and domestic \nviolence dynamics and victim behaviors.  They can overcome barriers by \n• \n222 \n\n• \ndemonstrating the context in which an intimate partner sexual assault occurs. \nThey can also persuade judges and juries to hold intimate partner sexual \nassailants accountable by ethically and aggressively charging and litigating \nintimate partner sexual assaults in a manner that exposes them as critical \nweapons in an offender's abuse of his partner. \n• \n\n• \n223 \n\n• \nISSUES IN CHARGING SEXUAL ASSAULT \n47 \nCASES\nThe prosecutor's authority to exercise discretion on charging \ndecisions is a key component of our criminal justice system. ABA Model \nRule 3.8(a) requires that the prosecutor refrain from prosecuting a charge not \nsupported by probable cause, while national standards establish that a \nprosecutor should only proceed on the basis of sufficient admissible \nevidence to support a conviction. \nAprosile~torsltiiflld \n\n. \n\nonlypr~i~edonthe \nProsecutorial discretion is subject to  •\nb~is ofsufficient '.£;;) .. \n\nconstitutional constraints such as equal  tiLnissibltt:ieviden(j:,{io \n\n',~:'l~,~';;\":~ ~·t  ',' \nsup/Wftll . \nprotection and due process. The prosecutor \nshould only file charges that adequately encompass the offense or offenses \nbelieved to have been committed and that rationally address the nature and \nscope of the alleged criminal activity. \nThe ultimate decision of how a case will proceed rests solely within \nthe role of the County Attorney; however, input from the victim is an \n47 Portions of this chapter were excerpted and modified with permission from: the Michigan Prosecutors Sexual \nAssault Prosecution Manual, published by the Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board and the  • \nProsecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan (2013); and the Wisconsin Sexual Assault Reference Book, published \nby the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance (2009). All rights reserved. \n224 \n\n• \nimportant component in the decision-making process and carries \nconsiderable weight in determining the best course of action. A charging \ndecision should not be made in haste. \nIs the Investigation Complete? \nIt is important that the law enforcement investigation is complete \nbefore filing charges against the accused. Before charging a case it is \nimportant to consider the following items (or lack thereof): \n• \t Forensic interview/statement from the victim (recorded) \n• \t Written reports from law enforcement \n• \t\n•  Medical evidence or a sexual assault examination \n• \t Medical report from a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner \n(SANE) \n• \t Recorded statement from the suspect \n• \t Recorded statement from all critical witnesses \n• \t Corroborating evidence (anything that might corroborate the \nvictim's statement) \n• \t Documented and properly inventoried physical evidence \n• \t Photographs (crime scene, victim's injuries, etc.) \n• \t Forensic examination and results from State Crime Lab \n• \t Criminal History of suspect(s) \n• \t 404(b) (other acts)  f the suspect( s)  \n0 \n• \t Any requested follow-up investigation by law enforcement \nThe prosecutor should address any problems, concerns, or needs for \nfollow-up investigation before filing charges, as well as be prepared for \n• \ndefense attorney's arguments. \n225 \n\n• \nSearch for Corroborating Evidence \nCorroboration is essential to the prosecution of sexual assault cases. \nAs part of the analysis ofthe case, the prosecutor should develop a time line \nthat includes everything leading up to the assault, including what the victim \nand offender did after the assault. The prosecutor should then attempt to \ncorroborate as many facts as possible to bolster the victim's credibility. \nDuring this process the prosecutor may \ndetermine that there needs to be additional \n~ecut(JF~i'~; \ninvestigation. While some ofthis may occur  .  :'case they \nC(/,I}f/\"o(get/Fom n~ading \nbefore the filing of charges, corroboration  the reparts.

Meeting with the victim provides prosecutors a feel for the case \nthey cannot get from reading the reports. Meeting with the victim is also a \npart of being victim-centered and demonstrates to the victim that the \nprosecution is taking the case seriously. \n• \n226 \n\n• \nIt is recommended that a third party, such as an investigator, \nparalegal, or fellow prosecutor be present during the interview with the \nvictim if any facts ofthe case will be discussed. Failure to have a witness \npresent could result in the prosecutor becoming a witness. Using an advocate \nas the third-party witness is discouraged, as advocates should not be put in \nthe position ofpotentially having to impeach their own clients. \nA victim advocate can, however, provide emotional support to the \nvictim and encourage the victim to share details that are important to \nreviewing and potentially charging the case. Victims have a statutory right to \n• \n\nhave a victim advocate during an interview.48 \nInterviewing the victim provides an opportunity to review the case \nfrom the victim's perspective, explain the process, uncover details that may \nhave been overlooked in the initial investigation, and determine what \noutcome the victim is seeking. To ensure the best outcome prosecutors \nshould: \n• \t Allow adequate time for the interview. \n• \t Conduct the interview in a place where the victim feels safe and \nable to speak freely . \n• \n48 Mont. Code Ann 46-24-106(7). \n227 \n\n• \t Adopt a \"seeking to understand\" perspective in questioning the  • \nvictim. \n• \t Review the victim's rights and explain the victim's role in the \n\nprosecution process, including the rape shield law, the charging \n\nprocess, trial and possible plea negotiations. \n\n• \t Inquire about any threats suspects may have made toward the \nvictim and respect and support the victim's efforts to maintain their \nsafety. \nA victim-centered approach also means that prosecutors should \nsupport victims who choose not to cooperate in moving the case forward. \nHowever, all victims should be assured they will be consulted as the case \nprogresses and well prepared for trial. \n•\nCharging Considerations/Analytical Framework \nDetermining whether to file charges is a broader decision than merely \nevaluating the evidence; the nature of the sexual assault crimes often results \nin little or no physical evidence. However, corroborative evidence, witness \nstatements, participation of the victim/witness in the case, and 404b \nevidence committed by the offender are likely to playa significant role in \nthe prosecution. \nProbable cause must exist to file any criminal charge. However, the \ninquiry does not end with the question ofwhether probable cause exists to \n• \ncharge the case. The prosecutor must also consider whether there is \n228 \n\n• \nsufficient credible, admissible evidence support a reasonable likelihood of \nprevailing at trial. The prosecutor should consider a number of factors: \n• \t Legal sufficiency. Is there sufficient evidence to prove each \nelement of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt? \n• \t Trial sufficiency: It is simply reality that some cases cannot \nmake it at trial. A case in which a victim's behavior fits neatly \ninto widely held rape myths should not be declined for that \nreason. Nor should a case be declined because the trial outcome \nis uncertain; doing so contributes to a vicious cycle. To \ndetermine whether a case is sufficient to take to trial, the \nprosecutor should carefully analyze: \no \t The prosecutor's ability to meet anticipated defenses, \naddress rape myths, address victim credibility issues, and \n• \n address and explain \"counterintuitive\" victim behavior. \nAny prosecutors concerned about their level of expertise \nshould consult with the Prosecution Services Bureau; \no \t The presence or absence of physical evidence; \no \t The presence/absence of corroborative evidence; \no \t Opportunities to present expert testimony; and \no \t The victim's wishes and well-being, including her ability \nto testify and be cross-examined. \nUse of Non-Sexual Assault Charges in the Information \nFrequently there are a multitude of non-sexual assault charges that are \nsupported by the facts. These may include: \n• \n229 \n\n•\n•  Burglary \n•  Theft \n•  Criminal Endangerment \n•  Kidnapping or Unlawful Restraint \n•  Privacy in Communications \n•  Assault/PFMA \n•  Intimidation \n•  Stalking \n•  Tampering with Witnesses/Evidence \n•  Any number of misdemeanors \nThere are a number ofreasons to include these charges in your \noriginal information. These crimes may provide corroboration of the victim \nas to the circumstances of non-consent. In addition, including them in the \n• \noriginal information and discovery may provide sufficient notice of 404(b) \nevidence or \"other acts.\" Finally, some charges may be stronger than others, \nand it may be possible to negotiate from a position of strength to accomplish \nthe goals ofthe prosecution. If the case goes to trial, however, the prosecutor \nshould consider whether giving the jury a choice between felonies and \nmisdemeanors is a wise course of action, as juries at times render \"split the \nbaby\" verdicts that could leave the prosecutor and/or the victim disappointed \nthat the jury convicted on less important charges with less significant \npenalties. \n• \n230 \n\n• \nDetermine If PFO Statute Applies \nPursuant to Section 46-18-501 a \"persistent felony offender\" is an \noffender who has previously been convicted of a felony and who is presently \nbeing sentenced for a second felony committed on a different occasion than \nthe first, if the second felony is committed in the time period specified in the \nstatute. \nProsecutors should review the defendant's prior criminal history and \ndetermine pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. § 46-18-501(1) & (2) ifhe/she can \nbe designated a persistent felony offender. \n• \n\nExcept as provided in Mont. Code Ann. § 46-18-219, a persistent \nfelony offender shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not less \nthan five years or more than 100 years or a fine not to exceed $50,000, or \nboth, if the offender was 21 years of age or older at the time ofthe \ncommission of the present crime. \nBecause the intent of the persistent felony offender statutes is that \nthey \"replace the sentence for the underlying felony,\" they should not be \nmade consecutive to a sentence.

Brooks, 2010 MT 226,358 Mont. 51,243 \nP.3d 405. \nTiming of Filing of Charges \nThe decision when to file charges in a sexual assault case requires \nbalancing of several factors. While it is desirable for the investigation to be \ncomplete before filing charges, prosecutors should carefully balance the \ndesire for a full and complete investigation with the safety concerns of the \nvictim when deciding when to file criminal charges in a sexual assault case. \nUpon receiving an investigative file from law enforcement, requesting \nthat criminal charges be filed, the prosecutor shall make contact with the  • \nassigned investigator within two (2) weeks ofreceiving the file to discuss \nthe case. After reviewing the investigative materials the prosecutor should \nput all requests for follow-up investigation in writing to the lead \ninvestigator. \nUpon receiving an investigative file from law enforcement for review \npurposes only, the prosecutor shall complete \n;T~tlJlil~i$ioltabout  . \nthe review within one (1) month or provide \nwhether and when toftliil \nchargf!s is /J:'fsedon.~L:\na written explanation to law enforcement for \nlf~lan. .te~tiJl·~dny· \nPictors~.·;!~·.'.  .  .  • \n232 \n\n• \nthe delay. The prosecutor shall provide written guidance as to concurrence \nwith law enforcement or suggested alternatives. \nOnce a complete file has been presented to the prosecutor, including \nany and all follow-up investigation, and the prosecutor has met with the \nvictim, a decision to charge a case should be made within 60 days. \nAny and all decisions to charge a sexual assault case should be \nreviewed by the supervising attorney within a reasonable period oftime \nprior to actually filing charges. \n• \n Procedures for Declined Cases \nAfter determining that a case should not be charged the prosecutor \nshould review the declined case with the assigned investigator to discuss the \nissues surrounding the \"no file\" decision. \nAfter meeting with the assigned investigator and discussing the \ndecision not to file charges in the case, the prosecutor should review the case \nwith his/her supervising attorney and/or staff the case with the other \nspecialized sexual assault prosecutors in the office. \nAfter reviewing the case with his/her supervising attorney and/or \n•  staffing the case with the other specialized sexual assault prosecutors in the \n233 \n\n• \noffice, if it is still the decision ofthe prosecutor not to file charges then the \nprosecutor shall prepare a detailed written explanation of why the evidence \nis insufficient to obtain a conviction or why prosecution of the case is not in \nthe interest ofjustice. The written explanation should be forwarded to the \ninvestigator and made a part of the case file. \nIf the prosecutor has made a decision to not file charges and the \nabove-listed criteria has been completed, the prosecutor should arrange a \nmeeting with the victim and victim advocate to explain the decision. \n• \n• \n234 \n\n• \nChapter 8 \n49 \nISSUES IN TRYING SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES\nThere are few categories of cases that require a prosecutor to use such \na wide array of tools as sexual assault cases.  Sexual assault cases often \nrequire forensics experts, psychologists and psychiatrists, medical experts, \ncounselors, and others. \nIn addition, few categories of cases \nrequire the attention to the victim and hislher \nt(isimportantfftj*~Vlifil.~ \nreilltiolzsnip ojtriist /;. \nfamily throughout the criminal adjudication.  In \nwith It·  l'ictim(·;A: \n• \nbe built \naddition, it is important to build a relationship \nin onedtlii!ting; it takes \neffort  \"  . ',~ -y\"',' \"  , .e'  ,~.    of trust with the victim.  A rapport cannot be \nbuilt in one meeting; it takes effort and time. \nIt is the prosecutor's job to shepherd the victim and others through the \ncriminal justice system, explaining what is happening or will happen, and \nbeing available to answer questions and alleviate concerns. \n49 A substantial portion of this chapter was excerpted and modified with permission from: the Michigan Prosecutors \nSexual Assault Prosecution Manual, published by the Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board \nand the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan (2013); the Wisconsin Sexual Assault Reference Book, \n• \npublished by the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance (2009); Prosecuting Alcohol-Facilitated Sexual Assault, \npublished by the National District Attorneys Association (2007); and Prosecuting Intimate Partner Sexual Assault, The \nVoice, Volume II, No.2, published by the National District Attorneys Association. All rights reserved. \n235 \n\n•\nProtecting Victims Pre-Trial \nPretrial Motions \nProsecutors should utilize pretrial motions to protect the victim's \nsafety and privacy. Pretrial motions also clarify the parameters of admissible \nevidence, force the defense to reveal and justify some of its tactics, and keep \nprejudicial and private information about the victim from the jury. \nThe following are some pretrial motions the prosecutor should \nconsider filing: \n• \n•  Bail. \nConditions ofbail should include measures to protect the \nvictim. Ask the judge to prohibit the defendant from having \ncontact with the victim and witnesses. Consider GPS, Pretrial \nSupervision, testing for drugs and/or alcohol, and anything else \nthat protects the victim from contact or harassment by the \ndefendant, and that protects the safety of the community. File a \npetition to revoke bail ifthe defendant violates any conditions \nof release. \n•  Courtroom. \nLet the victim get familiar with the courtroom and where you \nand the victim's supporters will be while she is testifying. \nConsider requesting additional law enforcement presence in the \ncourtroom ifthere are indications the defendant, his supporters, \nor anyone else may disrupt the courtroom or attempt to  • \n236 \n\n• \nintimidate the victim. You may not always succeed, but the \nvictim will see that you are fighting to protect her. \n• \t Rape Shield and other motions to protect unfair character \nattacks. \nFile a proactive motion to foreclose defense attempts to violate \nthe Rape Shield statute by introducing evidence ofthe victim's \npast sexual conduct. Think carefully about anything else the \ndefense might try to use to make the victim look bad. Does she \nhave tattoos or piercings? Did she have a baby at a young age? \nDoes she have a history ofusing alcohol or drugs? Prostitution? \nMental illness? Criminal convictions? Political activities the \njury could look down on? How would they look at her job, or \nthat she is on some sort of assistance program? Look for \nanything that is irrelevant or prejudicial, and determine whether \nthose things are actually inadmissible. By identifying those \n• \n\nissues early, you can protect the victim, even if the judge lets \nsome of that evidence in. \n• \t 404(b) evidence. \nWhen possible, the prosecutor may file a motion to introduce \nevidence of the defendant's other bad acts.  All too often, in \nnon-stranger sexual assault cases, the investigation looks only \nat the current case and does not look for prior sexual assaults. \nWhen possible, the prosecutor should ask police officers to \ninterview the defendant's friends, prior girlfriends, and others \nwho might know about prior acts.  Although these people may \nhave a reason to lie, they may also be willing to assist.  Ifthe \ndefendant has any prior cases, review those cases, even ifthey \nwere dismissed. Further investigation might be warranted. Do \nnot only look for completed sexual assaults; also look for \nevidence that can be used to demonstrate the defendant's \npattern ofbehavior toward women.  Prior bad acts stopping \n• \nshort of actual sexual assault may support the argument that he \n237 \n\n• \ndeceived the victim, manipulated her, or planned and \npremeditated the sexual assault. \nWorking with the Victim \nProsecutors can do at least three things to assist the victim in \ntestifying in a competent and credible manner:  (1) support; (2) protect; and \n(3) prepare the victim. \n•  Support the Victim. \nSupport can be provided in a number of ways - by the \nprosecutor, investigator, and/or advocate. Show the victim the \ncourtroom to ensure the victim is as comfortable as possible on \nthe witness stand. Provide a safe and comfortable place for the  • \nvictim to wait to testify.  A victim who feels supported is more \nlikely to feel more comfortable on the witness stand, which will \nmake her a better witness. \n•  Protect the Victim. \nA prosecutor should protect the victim to the best ofhis or her \nability, through pretrial motions, objections at trial, and other \nstrategies. A victim who feels protected through the process is \nless likely to become defensive or angry on the witness stand. \nWhen a victim becomes angry or defensive, jurors are likely to \nbelieve that she has something to hide, rather than recognizing \nthese reactions as normal human behavior. When the defense \nfiles frivolous motions intended to harass and intimidate the \nvictim, oppose them. For example, if the defense files motions \n• \nrequesting a psychological examination ofthe victim or asking \n238 \n\n• \nfor the victim's medical or counseling records, oppose them. \nThe State is not required to tum over any information not in its \npossession.50 Such records are privileged.51 The Montana \nSupreme Court has recognized such privileges and has \nprotected confidential records from disclosure.52 \n•  Prepare the Victim. \nTestifying in court can be as traumatic as the sexual assault \nitself because the victim is forced to relive the assault. \nProsecutors should prepare victims not only for direct \nexamination but also for the harsh reality of cross-examination. \nTo prepare a victim, discuss her substantive testimony as well \nas basic rules for testifying. Tell the victim that the most \nimportant rule for her to follow in the courtroom is to be \ntruthful.  Explain to the victim that if she attempts to hide or \n• \n exaggerate small details, the defense will probably be able to \nshow this on cross- examination. The defense will then argue in \nclosing that the victim is a liar and cannot be believed about the \nsexual assault if she cannot be believed about the small details. \nInstruct the victim on the importance of accuracy.  For example, \na victim may be inclined to say that the defendant \"ripped\" off \nher panties, when in fact he pulled them off, but did not rip \nthem.  The slightest imprecision opens the door for cross­\nexamination and may call the victim's credibility into question. \nAsk her to try to stay calm, since a victim who becomes angry \nwill be unable to think clearly.  Working with victim advocates \ncan make the preparation for direct examination more \ncomfortable for the victim and thus, more productive for the \nprosecutor. \n50 Mont. Code Ann. §46-15-322. \n51 Mont. Code Ann. §26-1-805, 807. \n• \n52 See State v. Reynolds, 243 Mont.l,8, 792 P.2d 111, 1115 (1990); State v. Donnelly, 244 Mont. 372, 798 P.2d 89 \n(1990); State v. Muir, 263 Mont. 211, 867 P.2d 1094 (194); State v. Duffy, 2000 MT 186,300 Mont. 381, 6 P.3d 453; \nState v. Little, 260 Mont. 460, 861 P.2d 154 (1993); State v. Rhyne (253 Mont. 513, 833 P.2d 1112 (1992). \n239 \n\n• \nIn cases in which the consent defense is used, cross-examination may \nbe particularly harsh.  Victims who are prepared in advance for the challenge \nof the experience will be better witnesses when they testify. An advocate \nmay be extremely helpful to the victim and to the prosecutor by being \npresent during preparation for cross-examination and during the trial itself. It \nmight also be helpful to have someone other than the prosecutor conduct a \nmock cross-examination of the victim. \nIn addition, when prepping the victim for trial, the prosecution team \nshould reinforce that the victim is not responsible for the sexual assault. The \n• \ndefendant, not the victim, is responsible for his behavior, and thus, the \nassault. Although the victim is not responsible for the assault, it is crucial to \nbe honest about all details ofthe case, especially drug and alcohol use. \nWhen preparing the victim for cross-examination, discuss questions \nthe defense attorney is likely to ask.  Explain that the defense is likely to \nportray her as a promiscuous party girl. If there is any memory loss, they \nwill be certain to focus on the fact that there are things she does not \nremember.  They might ask questions like, \"You consented to drink, and you \nconsented to drug use, didn't you?\"  Let the victim know that it is \nappropriate to respond truthfully that she might have consented to other  • \n240 \n\n• \nthings, but she did not consent to intercourse.  If there is a delay in reporting, \nthe defense will inquire about it.  If there were potential consequences for \nthe victim that were not enforced, such as being kicked out of college for \ndrinking or drug use, these will certainly be raised at trial. \nFinally, consider asking in your direct examination ofthe victim the \nquestions you expect the defense to ask in the victim's cross-examination. \nThe victim will be more comfortable answering you, and the jury will \nappreciate that you didn't shy away from difficult facts. \nJury Selection \n• \n\nJury selection is an often overlooked but critical part of a trial. Jury \nselection in Montana is controlled by M.C.A.§46-l6-ll4 through 118. The \npurposes ofvoir dire are to discover grounds for challenges for cause and to \ngain knowledge to facilitate an intelligent exercise ofperemptory \nchallenges. However, prosecutors should look at voir dire as another \nopportunity to educate the jury. \nJury selection can be persuasive and informative, and at its worst, dull \nand harmful to the case.  The best voir dire is one that sparks a conversation \nbetween the panel and the lawyer. It is the only chance prosecutors have to \n• \ntalk directly with the jury.  And while voir dire should be persuasive, \n241 \n\n• \nprosecutors cannot use it to get the jury to commit to the state's theory ofthe \ncase, indoctrinate them, or argue the prosecution's case. \nOne ofthe first tasks in jury selection is to identify the issues that will \nlikely cause difficulty in the case.  The goal is to identify which myths are \nlikely to be most prominent in the minds of the jury given the facts ofthe \ncase.  It may be the absence of injury, or that the victim was drinking with \nthe defendant, but whichever it is the focus of the questions must be on those \nprominent beliefs. \nThe. \ngoal is to identify \nOnce the issues in the case are \nrtj,ll~~hmyt:hs are likely to'; \n•\n'b~!\"q~,tjJ~\"inen~dn·thJ;,'·'\" \nidentified the process of formulating\nmil;~i;ofthejMry1iveJ't'the \nfaet~rofthe,ea~Jti:lt may be  appropriate jury questions can begin.

The suggested questions are just that, suggestions. \nThey are not intended as a script to be scrupulously followed. \n•  Lack of Physical Resistance \n• \n242 \n\n• \no  Analogize to a party store robbery. If someone walks into a \nconvenience store and points a gun at the clerk to demand the \nmoney from the cash register, would anyone expect the clerk to \nphysically fight back? Why not? \no \t And everyone would agree that the clerk made a choice to give \nthe robber the money, wouldn't you?  It was a choice?  And \nyou would agree that it was a smart choice? \no \t Does anyone think that the clerk consented or voluntarily gave \nthe robber the money when she made the choice to comply? \no  And if the robber tells police that the gun wasn't loaded, or it \nwasn't a real gun, and the clerk was never in danger, do we \nexpect the police to tell the clerk that it was all a \nmisunderstanding, she was never in any danger and so didn't \nhave to hand over the money?  So we all agree that what's \n• \nimportant is that the clerk was afraid of what might happen ifhe \nresisted and said \"No\"? \no \t We don't judge consent by what was in the robber's mind, do \nwe?  We judge consent by what the clerk believed and \nunderstood, don't we? \no \t The judge is going to tell you at the end of the trial that the \nvictim does not have to resist.  Now, you have taken an oath to \ntell the truth.  You haven't yet taken an oath to follow the law. \nSo if any of you think and believe that if the victim didn't \nresist, then it can't be sexual assault, it's okay to tell me now. \nIf you believe that if the victim didn't resist, that means she \nconsented to the sexual contact, it's okay to tell me that now. \nDo any ofyou believe that? [If no one says yes, \"That's good, \nyou all agree that when the judge tells you that the victim need \nnot resist, you will be able to follow the law, is that right?\"] \no  Does anyone think you have to be threatened with a weapon in \n• \norder to fear being injured or fear for your life? \n243 \n\no  You would all agree, wouldn't you, that someone [a man] who  • \nis physically bigger or stronger could make another person [a \nwoman] feel afraid by what he says?  Or by how he looks or \nacts?  Or perhaps by how he positions his body, say, by \nstanding between that person and the door, or lying on top of \nthem? \n•  Coercion and Threats \no  Does everyone agree that if someone threatens you with gun, \nlike in the robbery example, that is a threat?  The robber wants \nthe clerk to believe that the robber will shoot the gun ifhe \ndoesn't get what he wants, doesn't he?  Putting that all together \nthat's coercing someone by threat of force? \no  Are there other ways besides pointing a gun at someone?  What \nare some of those ways? \no  Parents are good at using their voices, and facial expressions,  • \nand body posture to \"convince\" their children to behave in a \ncertain way, aren't they.  That's a kind of coercion, too, isn't it? \no  What was it that got us to behave just by hearing a tone of \nvoice?  Did we know what was going to happen ifwe didn't? \nWhen we suspected that something bad was going to happen if \nwe didn't obey, weren't we really just accepting that we had no \npractical choice but to do as we were told?  Where did we get \nthat idea from (experience and circumstances)? \no  So does everyone agree that a person can be coerced into doing \nsomething when that person reasonably believes that there's no \npractical choice but to do it? \n• \n244 \n\n• \n•  Victim's Response to Trauma \no  Is there anyone here who has ever been through a traumatic \nevent, such as a car accident or physical injury, perhaps even a \nmugging or burglary? \no \t How did you respond right after it occurred? (Ask more than \none juror to explain their responses to the trauma; you should \nget varying responses.) \no \t Mr. Jones, you described a response to your situation which \nwas different than Ms. Green's response to hers. Do you think \ndifferent people react in different ways to stress? \no \t After the traumatic event, were you able to think clearly? \n• \n o \t Did you rely on your instinct to get through it? \no \t After the emergency was over and you had some time to reflect, \ndid you come up with things you wish you would have done \ndifferently? \no \t Did you react the same way you had thought you would? \no \t Do you think that victims of sexual assault might respond in a \nvariety of ways to trauma as well? \no \t Can you make room in your mind for that possibility and not \njudge the victim based on the way you think she should react? \n• \t Intoxicated Victim \n• \n245 \n\nCases in which the victim is voluntarily intoxicated without reaching  • \n\nthe level ofphysical helplessness can be challenging.  A common defense \nargument is that the victim in fact consented to sexual activity, but because \nshe was drunk she doesn't remember that she did so.  The defense can use \nintoxication to attack the victim's credibility, too.  Offenders rely on the jury \ndisbelieving the victim when she says she \nOffenders rely on thet;'i,;y;;~ \ndidn't consent, because she was drunk \njury disbelieJfi~g the ;:y,y . \nenough to do something she wouldn't have  ..., ,when'~I;ft:',~ays she \ne···· ,'. \n;bet~use \ndone sober and now regrets it.

And \nas!,~){ult'erajility. \n'''''C''; \nsometimes to excess? \no \t How many of you have seen really drunk people?  How did you \nknow that they were drunk? \no \t Do you think you could have persuaded that really drunk friend \nto hand you their wallet?  Or that you could have gotten their \nwallet out oftheir purse or their pants pocket without \nresistance? \n• \n246 \n\n• \no  Did you do it?  Why not?  Folks that are that drunk are pretty \nvulnerable, aren't they?  The fact that your friend was drunk \ndoesn't mean that he was consenting to you taking his wallet, \ndoes it?  That friend might act very differently if you tried to \ntake his wallet while sober, wouldn't he? \nAnother challenge when the victim was intoxicated is the fact that \nmany people can and do consent to sexual contact while drunk.  When one \njudges whether someone has agreed to something, they look to other facts \nand not solely that the other person was intoxicated.  The prosecutor should \ntry to get jurors to acknowledge that intoxication does not equal consent, and \nthat when someone is intoxicated their physical coordination and judgment \n• \t\nare affected in a way that makes the defense argument suspect. \no \t How many of you have had surgery or have had relatives \nwho had surgery where you were anesthetized?  Perhaps \neven dental surgery where you were given something to \nrelax you? \n. \n' \no \t And, thanks to all of us lawyers, how many forms dId you \nhave to sign acknowledging that you understood the risks \nand consented to the surgery?  Those doctor's didn't have \nyou sign those forms AFTER you were given the sedatives \nthat made you loopy, did they? You were asked to sign those \nbefore they gave you anything that would affect your \njudgment, weren't you?  Why do you think that is? \no  In our earlier example, how would you know if your drunk \n• \nfriend really consented to giving you the wallet?  You would \n247 \n\nlook to other things, wouldn't you?  What kind of things?  • \nHow many ofus would feel comfortable relying on what he \nsays ifwe ask if we can have his wallet? \n•  Inconsistent Statements \no  In our county, there are several parades every year. Let's \nimagine that you went to a parade and saw 5 marching \nbands, 10 politicians shaking hands and kissing babies, and \n3 beauty queens.  You talked to your neighbor right after the \nparade, and you told your neighbor that you saw 5 marching \nbands, 10 politicians shaking hands and kissing babies, and \n2 beauty queens.  Several hours later you see a friend of \nyours at dinner, and you tell that friend that you saw 5 \nmarching bands, 10 politicians shaking hands and kissing \nbabies, and 2 beauty queens. \no  Now, that is inconsistent with what you told your neighbor ­ • \nhave you lied?  How many of you think that under those \ncircumstances you are a liar?  Memory is a tricky thing, isn't \nit? \no  Let's suppose a month later you were asked by a reporter, \nsay, and you told the reporter that you saw 5 marching \nbands, 10 politicians shaking hands and kissing babies, 2 \nbeauty queens and the Shriners in their little cars.  Are you \nlying to the reporter?  Were you lying to your neighbor and \nfriend when you didn't tell them about the Shriners? \no  Suppose your pastor asks you if you visited the beer tent \nbefore you went to the parade, and you lie and say \"no\" \nbecause you don't want the pastor to think you are a bad \nperson.  Does that mean you are lying about what else \n• \nhappened at the parade? \n248 \n\n• \t\n•  Delay in Reporting \nPotential jurors may believe that a victim of a \"real\" sexual assault \nwould act in specific ways, and of course if the victim's response to the \nassault doesn't meet those beliefs those potential jurors may not believe that \nthe victim was assaulted. \no \t What do you think would be a person's first concern if they \nwere a victim of a traumatic event?  Can you think of a reason \nwhy a victim may not report immediately?  Ex. Embarrassment, \nhumiliation, fear ofretaliation, fear of not being believed. \no  Do you think that all women report being the victim of a sexual \n• \nassault immediately?  Can we agree that not every woman who \nis sexual assaulted reports it immediately? \no \t Do you think that the sexual assault might have an emotional \nimpact on a victim?  And what might some of those emotions \nlook like to you? \no \t Have any of you had the experience where you see something \nunexpected and amazing, something where you say, \"I can't \nbelieve my eyes.\"  And you didn't tell anyone right away \nbecause you weren't quite sure what it was you just \nexperienced? \n• \t The Defendant becomes a Stranger \nOne of the most traumatic circumstances of non-stranger sexual assault is \nthe betrayal of trust that a victim experiences when someone she knows \n• \t\nturns into a stranger. \n249 \n\no \t Have you or someone close to you been taken advantage of or  • \nbeen betrayed somehow by someone close to you?  Did you \nexpect this to happen or did it take you by surprise? And at \ntimes do we look back and still say, \"I can't believe he did \nthat?\" \no \t How many ofus, when that betrayal happened, were \nspeechless?  Didn't know how or even if to react?  And later \nwhen someone asks, \"What did you do?\" or \"What did you say \nto that?\" all we can say is that we we're stunned, or speechless? \no \t We've all heard the story about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde--- how \nDr. Jekyll undergoes a complete personality change to become \nMr. Hyde. Now that's an extreme case, but has anyone in their \nown life experience encountered someone whose personality \nseemed to change? Tell us about that. Did you see it coming or \nwere you surprised? \n•\n• \t Consent \nSince most non-stranger sexual assaults are defended on the issue of \nconsent it is imperative that the prosecutor ask about the potential jurors' \nconception of what consent is, what it looks like, and how to recognize it. \nProsecutors should cover any definitions or jury instructions on consent that \nare going to be read to the jury. \no \t In our everyday lives how can we tell if someone is consenting \nto a request? \no \t Imagine for a minute that when traveling here I was stuck in a \nline oftraffic because of some construction, and someone was \n• \npulling into the lane in front ofme.  How would he know that I \n250 \n\n• \nconsented to him pulling into the lane ahead of me? I might \nraise my hand and gesture to the other driver. \no \t Do we all agree that we can communicate are consent by our \nactions?  In fact, isn't that usually how we do communicate it? \no \t Now, if I held up my hand and I was trying to tell the other \ndriver to stop inching into my lane, and the other driver \nmisinterpreted my actions and thought I was consenting, does \nthat mean I really was?  All agree that what was in my mind is \nwhat's important? (Possible follow up with a question about \nwillingness to follow the law that consent is in the victims \nmind, not the defendants. There's no reasonable mistake of fact \ndefense.) \no  Have any of you ever made an online donation to a charity \n•  using a credit card?  If you're like me, it makes you feel pretty \ngood for having contributed to a worthy cause. \no \t And if your experience is anything like mine, about a month \nlater you get something in the mail from the charity.  A \"free \ngift\" like a refrigerator magnet or return address labels.  Of \ncourse, there's always another letter asking for another \ndonation.  Have most of us had that experience? \no \t So what happens next?  Don't we get the phone call asking for \na donation?  And we think about it, but let's say we decide not \nto donate at this time. \no \t So then maybe a few months later you open up your credit card \nstatement and you see another charge to the charity, only you \ndidn't authorize another donation.  What do you do?  Imagine \nthat the charity says that they charged the card because you \n• \n donated before.  It's no big deal, right? \n\n251 \n\no \t How would that make you feel?  Does anyone think that we  • \nshould have to prove to them that we didn't consent to the \ncharge?  Can we all agree that it's up to the charity to seek our \nconsent, that it cannot be assumed?  And that's true for a whole \nlot of other things, isn't it? \nOpening Statement \nEvery sexual assault is unique. When a sexual assault case proceeds \nto a jury trial, the goal of the prosecution is to convince the jury that the \nassault occurred and that the defendant's conduct meets all of the elements \nof the offense charged. \n• \nThe best way to meet the goal of establishing the defendant's guilt is \nto relate an account of the events that makes sense, explains undeniable \nfacts, and provides reasons for why people acted the way they did through \nthe testimony of witnesses. In other words, you have to have a theory to \nexplain what it is that the defendant did and relate the account in such a \nway that the jury understands and believes it happened. \nThe opening statement should be relatively brief, quickly grab the \nattention of the jury, succinctly relay important facts for the jury through \nthe witnesses they will hear form during the trial, tell them what to look for \n• \nduring the presentation of evidence, and tell them what you expect them to \n252 \n\n• \ndo after they hear all of the evidence. \nFirst, develop a theme and theory for your case. Then, begin your \nopening by using a short phrase that quickly and accurately summarizes \nwhat the central issue ofthe case is. Another method is to provide a theme \nthat the jury will be readily able to identify with and provide a perspective \nthrough which to view the evidence as it is presented. Another method is to \nimmediately shock the jury with a statement that the defendant made \nduring the course of the assault that they will remember when it is repeated. \nSelection ofthe best method depends on the \n• \n\nstyle of the prosecutor and a careful \nevaluation of the evidence that will be \npresented at trial. Take care to repeat your \ntheme and theory, through your opening statement and throughout your \ntrial presentation. \nAfter the introduction, tell the jury through a narrative about the key \nfacts you expect to present in evidence. The narrative should be compelling, \nusing descriptive words and active voice verbs. Other strategies for an \neffective opening include: \n• \n253 \n\n• \t Using visual aids, like an exhibit such as a photograph you are  • \ncertain will be admitted at trial, which is simple and presented \nso that it is easily viewable by all members of the jury. \n• \t U sing a PowerPoint presentation. If you decide to use the \nPowerPoint, make certain that you are familiar and \ncomfortable with its use so that it does not interfere in the \nmessage you are trying to convey. \n• \t Holding the jury's interest by using gestures and body \nlanguage appropriate to the story you are telling. Vary your \nvoice in pitch, rate or pace, volume, and tone. Pause when \nappropriate to focus attention on the point you want the jury to \nremember. Look all individual jurors in the eye, but do not \nmake them feel uncomfortable. \n• \t Setting the scene, identifying the critical players and \nestablishing important time sequences and significant events.  • \nContinue to introduce the theme of the trial. Identify for jurors \nthe human values present in the facts ofthe case. Select a \npoint ofview from which to narrate the facts and stick with it \nthroughout your opening statement. \n• \t Not arguing the case. The opening statement is not an \nopportunity to argue the case, nor is it the time to bore the jury \nwith details that in the end are not going to matter one way or \nthe other how the jury is going to find the defendant guilty. \nStyle is just as important as having a command ofthe facts. It \nis vital that you relate the facts of your case without being \ncondescending, wooden, argumentative or inarticulate. \nFinally, end your opening statement by telling the jury what you \nexpect them to do when they deliberate their verdict. Tell them to find \n• \n254 \n\n• \nthe defendant guilty. Engage the jury in the process by having them \nadopt your perspective and the theme that you selected for the trial. \nOrder of Witnesses \nPresentation is key in a jury trial. Juries do not want to hear a \ncollection of facts, they want to hear a story that convinces them that the \nvictim was sexual assaulted by the \nPl~eieitting'\n'\",,,,\" \n, \nli'itnesses wltiJ \ncall;, \ndefendant. Any good story should begin \n~~tablis1t th~fitcts and \n,: ~ '; \ncunllst(J~nC'l;~s;'Whi!lA'  strong and end strong. If the victim is not \n•  a strong witness it may be better to call the \ninitial officer or SANE nurse as the first \nwitness, so that the jury can understand \ninl1~:ller toplace tlte, \nvil;4fjtis frrstimony in  the emotional impact or trauma ofthe \np~tlerc~~text. \nassault. In some cases it is the actual \ntestimony of the victim giving graphic details about the assault that will \ngrab the attention ofthe jury. \nPresentation is always case specific. Prosecutors must also pay close \nattention to the order of witnesses presented at trial in order to facilitate the \njury's understanding of the context in which the sexual assault took place. \n• \nCorroboration of the victim's account ofthe assault is essential to the jury's \n255 \n\n• \nunderstanding of the case. Typically, presenting witnesses who can \nestablish the facts and circumstances which made it possible for the \ndefendant to commit the assault assists the jury and should be presented \nbefore the victim testifies in order to place the victim's testimony in proper \ncontext. The victim's testimony should be the focal point ofthe State's case \nafter the context is set with remaining expert witnesses used to corroborate \nthe victim's testimony. Corroborating testimony typically are fact \nwitnesses who corroborate the victim's version of the event and can \ninclude observations by lay witnesses, documentary evidence including \nbank transactions telecommunication and computer records, medical  • \n\nexpert testimony, forensic expert testimony, and/or expert testimony on \nreactive behavior ofvictims. \nWitness order is important throughout the prosecutor's presentation \nof the case from beginning to end. The conclusion of the story in your \ncase-in-chief should end as strongly as it began. It is important that the last \nwitness have a powerful impact upon the jury, convincing the jury ofthe \ndefendant's guilt. \nDirect Examination of the Victim \n• \n256 \n\n• \nNo one knows better what happened, how she felt and why she \nresponded as she did during and after the sexual assault than the victim. \nThis is the reason why the victim's testimony is the most fundamental \naspect of your case, and why her credibility is crucial. In order for the jury \nto properly assess the credibility issues in your case, they must be able to \nfiguratively \"walk in her shoes\" (although it is impermissible to ask the \njury to do so) and look at the assault from her perspective rather than \njudging and second-guessing from the comfort of their 20-20 hindsight \njuror seats. \n• \n\nThe victim's experience needs to be made known to the jury, \nespecially in cases where consent is the defense, which means that you \nmust, through her, tell the whole story and paint a vivid and clear picture \nofthe crime for the jury. A good place to start in preparing for direct \nexam, therefore, is by asking the victim to tell you about what she wants \nto say. \nFrom the time of the first meeting with the victim, through \nanalyzing, preparing, and trying to the case, listen to her to gain \ninformation about how the offender observed vulnerability and capitalized \n• \n257 \n\n• \nupon it. Her vulnerability is, therefore, a key aspect that must be explored \nin her testimony. Accordingly, the direct exam ofthe victim must: \n• \t Humanize the jury and allow them to get to know her; \n• \t Allow the jury to see, her and feel what the victim had to say, \nwhat she heard, and how she felt (physically and emotionally) \nduring the assault and after; \n• \t Provide evidence, in the testimony itself, and in addition to \nany physical evidence you have, that proves every element of \nthe crime(s) charged beyond a reasonable doubt. At the end of \nthe direct, any corroboration is icing on the cake - the jury \nshould be viewing all corroboration as almost expected, \nbecause they find themselves believing what the victim had to \n• \n\nsay; \n• \t Explain the facts fully so that the jury is not left to speculate; \n• \t Make your victim invulnerable to cross-examination.. \nBy this point, you have a developed theme and theory of your case. \nHow does your victim fit into the plan of proving the elements of the \ncrime? How can you ensure that blame is falling where it should - on the \noffender, and not on the victim? Your theme should be pointing in the \ndirection of the offender. \nPreparation is key to effective victim testimony. During an effective \n• \ndirect examination of the victim you are going to have to go into \n258 \n\n• \nexcruciating detail with her, and she is going to have to trust you to get her \nsafely through what is going to be an ordeal. She must feel prepared, non­\ndefensive and confident in both her ability to field all questions, and in \nyour ability to present her story. Therefore, you cannot be a stranger to her. \nDeveloping a good working relationship with the victim is essential for \neffective presentation of her case. In your pre-trial preparation you must: \n• \t Allow you victim to express herself as she does; \n• \t Allow her to voice her concerns; \n• \t Identify any special skills or problems she has - does she have a \n• \n\nsomewhat limited vocabulary? Does she think for a long time before \nshe answers? You will have to adjust to, and help the jury adjust to \nand expect her idiosyncrasies; \n• \t Assess her ability to introduce exhibits; \n• \t Thoroughly vet all the facts; \n• \t Explore apparent \"inconsistencies\" - is it truly inconsistent, or \nsomething else? \n• \t Prepare the victim for expected defense questioning; \n• \t Assure her that you are not afraid of the truth, that knowledge is \npower, for both of you; \n• \t Show her the courtroom. Tell her where the major players will be \nsitting when she comes in to testify, where she will go to be sworn in, \n• \t\nwhere you will be, and where her supporters will be in the gallery. \n259 \n\nOnce the victim can approach the witness stand with confidence and  • \ndignity, you are prepared to proceed before the jury to introduce her. \n• \t Ask about school, family, skills and goals. \n• \t Introduce the advent of the defendant into the victim's life - have \nher explain any relationship, and any changes in the way she feels \nabout him now, vs. before she was attacked. \n• \t Move into a slower, quieter discussion ofthe events leading up to the \nassault itself. Begin focusing on every possible sensory and \nperipheral detail, asking specific questions about what she saw, \nheard, felt, etc. \n• \t Allow the victim to narrate, and go back over and into details as \nnecessary. As she relates the events of the assault, slow the pace of \nthe questions down even more, and take her and the jury back \nthrough important segments, getting more details. Include any words \nsaid by either, what the offender looked like, how his voice sounded, \nhow his face, voice or body changed during the assault, how he  • \nreacted to her words or actions, what she was thinking at very major \npoint during the assault. \n• \t Have her explain what options she considered, and why she chose the \noptions she did. \n• \t Have her explain any physical sensations \n• \t Have her explain her perceptions of the defendant before, during and \nafter the attack. Remember to include words and phrases that echo \nyour theme, and emphasize the words and phrases she uses that help \nfurther the theme, too. \n• \t When consent is an issue, spend time on how she communicated to \nthe defendant through her words and actions that she was not freely \nand voluntarily engaging in the acts. Use any corroboration available \nto show her unequivocal \"No\" \n• \t Discuss her decision to report and her experiences with the police and \nmedical personnel. \n• \n• \t If possible, have her describe the immediate physical and mental \n260 \n\n• \nimpact ofthe assault on her, as well as any longer term effects on her \nlife. Include any expressions ofhumiliation and/or degradation. \n•  Anticipate areas of cross-examination and defuse them \n•  End on a strong note \nExpert Testimony \nIn Chapter 3, we discussed the impact oftrauma on sexual assault \nvictims, and how it affects memory and \nbehavior in ways that are often \nmisinterpreted by others.  Victims of sexual \nassault are subjected to intense scrutiny and \n• \noften times it is their behavior, rather than \nthe offenders', that ends up being put \"on \ntrial.\" Offenders count on the jury believing \nthat certain behaviors mean that the victim \nis lying.  For example, the offender wants the jury to believe that a \"real\" \nsexual assault victim would immediately report the assault to police, or \nwould scream or cry out for help during the assault.  Prosecutors need an \nexpert to explain that these behaviors are not unexpected and, rather than \nbeing proof that the victim is lying, they are in fact evidence consistent with \n• \nthe victim's reported history of assault.  An expert's testimony can provide \n261 \n\n• \n\nthe necessary framework for jurors to \nItwill/bl.{lt~lplu4,and;; \npe~ltap!!'neces~aryJ to' . \naccurately interpret a victim's behavior, \n:!!~~~~~' \nassess a victim's credibility and to ensure \nprost/cutions•.

Do not underestimate \nthe extent to which inaccurate beliefs about what victims \"should\" do, or \nwhat constitutes \"real rape,\" will affect the jury's understanding of the case.  • \n\nThese beliefs are so deeply ingrained, there is going to be some aspect ofthe \nvictim's behavior that will need to be explained to the jury.  Is it the failure \nto cry out for help or perceived lack of resistance?  Did the victim act in a \nway that appears to be \"cooperative?\" As discussed previously, these are \nbehaviors frequently interpreted by jurors as evidence of consent. \nWas there a delay in reporting?  Did the victim make apparently \ninconsistent statements?  These factors are often used by the defense to \nimpeach the victim's credibility. \n• \n262 \n\n• \nThe prosecutor's first task, then, is \nWhiJe:i!ducatiol1;.and \ntraining 4re importU:r!t, \nto determine which of these issues will \nthoselac(itJ;'$ are./1, \nneed to be addressed and explained  sulflcient;Jtis th \nwisdon.i'·the*kn~.·' \n>\nthrough expert testimony in the case.

Potential sources of experts \ninclude: \n• \t Sexual assault service providers (counselors or advocates) \n• \t Mental health professionals (psychiatrists, psychologists, social \nworkers, etc.) who specialize in working with sexual assault victims) \n• \t Medical professional (preferably a forensic nurse examiner, or some \nother professional with substantial experience performing the sexual \nassault medical forensic exams) \n• \t Police officers \nThe choice of expert will be driven by the issues that need to be \n• \t explained, and by the predilections of the judge who will be deciding the \n263 \n\n• \nadmissibility ofthe expert's testimony.  For example, it shouldn't be \nnecessary in most cases to call a neurobiologist to explain the complex \nchemical processes that occur during trauma.  Instead, a professional with \nsubstantial experience working with victims of trauma will be able to \nexplain that gaps in memory, intermittent recall of details ofthe event, and \ninconsistent statements, are all common ways in which victims of sexual \nassault react to the trauma of the assault. \nOne is qualified as an expert through education, training, specialized, \nknowledge and experience.  MR.Evid.702. The most significant ofthese will \n• \nbe the expert's experience with victims of sexual assault.  While education \nand training are important, those factors are not sufficient.  It is the practice \nwisdom, the knowledge and experience that comes from working with \nvictims over time and integrating education with real life that is most \ncompelling. This is true in many arenas - if one must have surgery, one \ntypically will choose the doctor who has successfully performed this surgery \nmany, many times, and will pass over the doctor who has only performed the \nsurgery a few times even though that doctor graduated from the best \nuniversity, top in the class. \n• \n264 \n\n• \nIf at all possible, the prosecutor should avoid using a treating \nphysician, or a sexual assault counselor or advocate who provided services \nthat are protected by privilege. This helps protect the victim's right of \nprivacy in treatment.  When the prosecutor calls the treating professional, it \nmay inadvertently put the victim's mental state at issue in the trial.  This \ncould allow the defense an unwarranted opportunity to seek testimony about \ntreatment and diagnosis from that expert.  Moreover, calling the treating \nprofessional as one's expert can create strong feelings of insecurity and \nuncertainty in the victim as to what that professional's role is.  Victims may \n• \n worry that what they say to their counselor will not be kept confidential, or \nthey may feel betrayed or disappointed when that professional does not act \nas an advocate for them at trial.  Finally, calling a treating professional gives \nthe defense an opportunity to challenge the expert as biased because oftheir \nintimate knowledge of the victim and the circumstances of that victim's \ncase, and can be seen as impermissibly bolstering victim credibility simply \nby the association of the two people. \nExplaining Common Reactions to the Trauma ofSexual Assault \nExperts are called to explain that many of the normal human \n• \nresponses to trauma run counter to the ingrained societal views as to how a \n265 \n\n• \nvictim of sexual assault should respond.  An expert might be called to \nexplain behavior a jury perceives as being inconsistent with one who has \nbeen sexually assaulted, such as: \n•  Delayed reporting \n•  Victim recantation \n•  Victim self-blame or minimization \n•  ~emorylapses \n•  Lack of resistance during sexual assault \n•  Incomplete or inconsistent recall of the sexual assault \n•  Lack ofphysical injuries  • \n•  Lack of apparent disruption in daily activities of living \n•  Inappropriate Affect \n•  Freeze response \n•  Compliance during assault \n•  Continued contact and/or relationship with offender \n•  Post assault victim behavior \nIt is important that prosecutors consider that an expert may be helpful \nnot only in explaining victim behavior leading up to and during the assault, \nbut also explaining post-assault behaviors of the victim that are consistent \nwith someone who has experienced a traumatic event. Examples might be  • \n266 \n\n• \nchanges in daily life patterns, avoidance ofthings associated with trauma, \ndiminished interest in day-to-day activities.  A woman assaulted at college \nmight stop attending classes, might drop out of school, or might avoid being \nat the place where the offender is likely to be.  This testimony can serve to \nrebut the defendant's claim of consent. \nDirect Exam ofthe Expert Witness and Cautions \nThe questions listed below are not intended to replace the questions \ntypically asked when laying a foundation for the prosecution expert. \n53 \n• \n\n•  Laying Foundation \nOccupation \no  What is your occupation? \no  How long have you been employed in that capacity? \no  Describe the responsibilities ofyour position. \no  How long has the program/agency been in existence? \no  What services does your program/agency offer? \no  Do you supervise? \no  Do you train staff? \no  What is the total number of staff? \nRape Crisis Center/Shelter \n• \n53 These questions were published in the Wisconsin Sexual Assault Reference Book and were adapted with pennission \nfrom the American Prosecutors Research Institute ofthe National District Attorneys Association by the Prosecuting \nAttorneys Association of Michigan. \n267 \n\no \t How many contacts do you receive yearly from victims identifying  • \nthemselves as having experienced sexual abuse or violence? \no \t How many crisis calls do you receive yearly? \no \t How many residents in your shelter at one time? \no \t How many residents yearly? Adults?  Children? \no \t How long can residents stay? \no \t Does your program offer any other services? \nCounseling/Support Services \no \t Are your services solely for victims of sexual assault? \no \t Are your services solely for women? \no \t How many persons are served by this program yearly? \no \t Do you provide counseling/support services to victims of sexual \nviolence? \no \t Do you have direct contact with victims of sexual assault \no \t How many victims do you directly come in contact with yearly? \no \t What is the approximate period of time you have contact with an \n•\nindividual victim? \no \t What is the nature of your contact with victims? \no \t Do you or your program conduct interviews with victims? \no \t What is the purpose of the interviews? \no \t Are interviews conducted with both crisis calls and clients? \no \t What kind of information do you maintain? Type of assault?  Age \nof victim and assailant? Length of relationship? \nPrevious occupation (if relevant) \no \t What was your previous occupation? \no \t How long did you perform those duties? \no \t What were your responsibilities? \no \t Did you have direct contact with victims of sexual violence? \no \t What was the nature of that contact? \no \t Have you had any other relevant job experience with victims of \nsexual violence? \nEducation \n• \n268 \n\n• \no  What is the highest degree you have obtained? \n\no  What was your area of concentration? \n\no  Did you conduct any fieldwork related to sexual violence? \n\no \t Have you conducted research in this area? \no \t Were the results of your study developed into a paper?  Were they \npublished? \nProfessional affiliations (if relevant) \no \t Do you belong to any professional organizations or associations? \nAny related to sexual violence? \no \t What is the nature and purpose of those organizations? \no \t Do you belong to any county, state, or national organizations \nwhich specifically address sexual violence issues? \no \t What is the purpose of those organizations? \no \t Are you involved with any committee work of these organizations? \nWhat is that nature of that committee work? \nTraining \n• \n\no \t When you began your work at your program, did you receive any \ntraining in the issues of sexual? Please describe that training \no \t Have you received any additional training in sexual issues? Please \ndescribe that training \no \t Have you conducted any trainings yourself? \no \t What were the topics of the trainings? \no \t For whom did you conduct the trainings? \no \t For what purpose were the trainings designed? \no \t How many attended the trainings? \no \t How often do you conduct such trainings? \nConferences \no \t Have you attended state or national sexual violence conferences? \no \t Who sponsored the conference? \no \t What was the purpose of the conference? \no \t When and where was the conference? \no \t Did you attend any workshops relevant to sexual violence issues? \no \t Have you conducted any workshops or presentations at these \n• \t\nconferences? \n269 \n\n• \nPrevious Expert Testimony \no \t Have you testified previously in court? \no \t Was it a criminal or civil case? \no \t How many times? \no  For the defense or the prosecution? \nAfter laying this foundation, it is important that you proffer your \nexpert as qualified in as broad an area of expertise as needed.  It is too \nnarrow to suggest, for example, that the expert is qualified in the area of \ndelayed reporting, for example.  Rather, the expert should be recognized as \nqualified to testify regarding the effect of sexual assault on victims, and the \ncommon victim response to trauma in sexual assault cases. Once the expert \n• \n\nis qualified, questions to him or her should immediately begin educating the \njury.  The questions should focus on telling the jury what they do not know. \nThe following introductory questions can be used to educate the court and \njury about sexual violence, as well as to explain victim behavior and dispel \nrape myths. \n• \t Testimony About Myths Surrounding Sexual Violence \no \t Do you give presentations to civic groups, schools, and other \npublic forums on issues associated with sexual assault or have \nother opportunities to talk with members of the public about those \nissues? \n• \n270 \n\n• \no  Have you found the public to be well informed about sexual \nassault- how it happens, and how victims react?  This addresses \ncommon misperceptions and this is where you can hone the facts in \nthe case that are at issue. \no \t Does the public have misconceptions about sexual assault? \n(Typical answer: Yes.  They expect them to report immediately, \netc.... They believe that there is a set of behaviors and responses \nthat a \"real victim\" should exhibit.) \no \t From your experience, how do most people develop these \nmisconceptions? \no \t Are you familiar with any articles or books (or have your attended \nany trainings) discussing the myths versus the realities of sexual \nviolence? \n• \n o  Based on your experience, do all victims behave the same way? \n\n• \t Testimony About Victim Behaviors \no \t Based upon your experience, training, education, and work \nwith victims of sexual assault, what are some common \nvictim behaviors/reactions to assault? \no \t Do all victims behave the same way? \no \t Through your numerous experiences with sexual assault \nvictims, have you gathered insight into the reasons why a \nvictim may behave a certain way? \no \t Based upon your experience, please explain the reasons. \n• \n271 \n\no \t In your experience, do victims of sexual assault generally  • \nreport that they have been sexually assaulted right away? \no \t Do some never report or report only years later? Why is \nthat? \no \t Do all sexual assault victims characterize what happened to \nthem as a crime or violation? \no \t Have you personally observed victims having difficulty \nrelating the actual facts ofthe violence? Why is this so? \no \t Do some sexual assault victims minimize their experience of \na sexual assault or the impact she has endured? \no \t Based on your knowledge and experience, is it possible that \nsomeone could be sexually assaulted and not acknowledge \nthat it was a crime?  • \no \t Why does that happen? \no \t Based on your knowledge, training and experience, what is \nthe impact of a traumatic event like sexual assault? \no \t Is it unusual for victims of sexual assault to disclose in \nlayers? \no \t For example, have you ever had a sexual assault victim who \nwhen initially asked by police about what happened, gives a \nvery brief account, and then later more details come out? \nThe answer will be something like: Yes, they may not have \nbeen able to provide all the details for many reasons.  They \nmay not have been able to recall the details because ofthe \ntraumatic impact on memory recall.  They may have made a \nconscious decision not to give all the details because of lack  • \n272 \n\n• \nof trust and rapport with the officer.  Victims respond \naccording to recall and trust. \no \t In your experience, do victims sometimes deny the level of \nviolence as the incident passes in time? \no \t Have you ever had a victim tell you they used some sort of \nillegal substance, like marijuana, but did not tell the police \nthat information? \no \t Does a victim of trauma recall the event exactly or precisely \nin the order in which it occurred? \no \t When you talk to victims of sexual assault, do you expect \nthem to be able to give you a linear, chronological and \ncomplete narrative ofthe incident? Why? \n• \no  From your experience, is it common for a victim of sexual \nviolence to completely deny the incident? Why? \no \t From your experiences with sexual assault victims is it \ncommon for victims to be reluctant to testify by the time the \ntrial occurs? Why? \no \t From your experience, do victims sometimes deny the \nincident ofviolence as time passes? Why? \no \t How does that relate to the dynamics of sexual violence? \no \t Is it common for the victim to protect the offender? Why? \no \t Does every victim react to the trauma of sexual assault in the \nsame way? \n• \n273 \n\no \t Is it uncommon for a victim to show little emotion, or even  • \nexhibit seemingly inappropriate emotions, when asked to \nrecount the trauma of sexual assault? \no \t Do some victims even react angrily? \no \t What are some of the reasons you have discovered for this \nbehavior? \no \t Based upon your experience, are you aware of victims who \nhave maintained contact with the individual who allegedly \nassaulted them? \no \t What are some ofthe reasons for this behavior? \no \t Have you interviewed the victim in this case? \no \t Have you interviewed any witness connected with this case?  • \no \t Are you familiar with the facts of the case? \no \t Is your testimony today based on your experience, training, \neducation, and work with victims of sexual assault? \n• \t Cautions about \"Rape Trauma Syndrome\" and \"Post Traumatic \nStress Disorder\" \nUsing the term Rape Trauma Syndrome (RTS) in a criminal case is \ninappropriate, not only because it misleads the jury into believing that the \nvictim suffers from a mental or emotional disorder - a \"syndrome,' but \nbecause it unnecessarily and wrongly pathologizes the victims of crime. \n• \n274 \n\n• \nCalling something a \"syndrome\" also assumes that it has a beginning, \nmiddle and end, which is not the case with traumatic response. Rape Trauma \nSyndrome (RTS) was first coined by Ann Burgess and others as a way of \ndescribing a constellation of'symptoms that they observed among survivors \nof sexual assault in their clinical practices.  The use of the term R TS began \nas a clinical tool; however, it has never become a diagnosis on the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM), and was \nnever intended to be a diagnosis of any disorder or syndrome. \nPTSD is in fact a recognized disorder in the DSM.  However, not all \n• \n\nvictims of sexual assault will be diagnosed with PTSD, and whether they are \nis not relevant.  It is the behavior of sexual assault victims in general that \nneeds to be explained to the jury in order to assist them in understanding the \nissues in the case before them, not whether those behaviors are part of any \nrecognized diagnosis. It is better practice to talk in terms of common \nreactions to the trauma of sexual assault. That has the added benefit of often \nbeing based in large part on the expert's experience working with sexual \nassault victims.  This approach also allows the expert to recognize that each \nvictim is unique, their manner of reacting to the trauma of sexual assault is \n• \n275 \n\n• \nunique, and if that behavior seems non-intuitive to the jury it can be \nexplained by an expert with appropriate experience. \nThe National District Attorneys Association has endorsed the use of \n\"blind\" expert testimony to assist the jury in fairly assessing a victim's \nbehavior: \nProsecutors must explain victim behavior to provide jurors \nwith an accurate context in which to evaluate victim behavior \nso that jurors do not misjudge certain conduct as evidence of a \nvictim's dishonesty and incredibility.  Many courts have \nrecognized that expert testimony is necessary to prevent jurors \nfrom misjudging the victim based upon their misperceptions \nu.s.  • \n\nof victims. For example, in  v. Rynning, a case involving \nchild sexual abuse, the Unites States Court ofAppeals for the \nArmed forced noted: \"the victim's behavior will not \nnecessarily undermine his or her credibility if an expert can \nexplain that such patterns of counterintuitive behavior often \noccur in sexual abuse cases.' Prosecutors therefore, should \nconsult an expert - social worker, therapist, counselor, \npsychologist or physician, among others - to explain victim \nbehavior to the jury. If the prosecutor does not address and \nattempt to explain victim's behavior, either through expert \ntestimony or the victim herself, the jury will be left without \nthe proper context in which to evaluate her credibility. \n54 \n• \n54 Introducing Expert Testimony to Explain Victim Behavior in Sexual and Domestic Violence Prosecutions, p.9, \nNational District Attorneys Association/American Prosecutors Research Institute (2007). \n276 \n\n• \nThe Montana Supreme Court has recognized that victims of sexual \nabuse respond with seemingly \"puzzling and contradictory behavior.\"  State \nv. Robins, 2013 MT 71,  16,369 Mont. 291, 297 P.3d 1213.  An expert's \n~ \ntestimony in this regard was challenged in Robins, a case involving the \nsexual assault of a child. \nThe Montana Supreme Court stated of Dr. Dutton, the State's expert: \nDutton's testimony qualifies under M. R. Evid. 702 as \neducational testimony on a to~ic outside of most jurors' \ncommon experience.  Dutton s testimony was intended to help \nthe jury comprehend some ofC.G.'s beliavior that might have \notherwise seemed inconsistent with abuse.  For example, \nDutton explained that it was not unusual for sexual aouse \nvictims to not report the abuse, especiallY when the victim has a \n• \nclose relationship with the offender, or for the victim to act \ninappropriately when discussing the abuse.  Dutton also may \nhave helped tlie jury see Robins's actions as a pattern of abuse. \nDutton's testimony did not impinge upon the jury's obligation\nto ultimately decide C.G.'s crediollity; it merely allowed the \njurors to make an informed decision. \nId. ~ 17 (emphasis added). \nThe Montana Supreme Court has also held that expert testimony of \nthis kind is admissible in cases involving adult victims of sexual assault and \ndomestic violence. \nIn State v. Brodniak, expert testimony on rape trauma syndrome in a \ncase involving an adult victim was found to be generally admissible, \nalthough the expert could not testify as to the victim's credibility. State v. \n•  Brodniak, 221 Mont. 212, 222; 718 P.2d 322,329 (1986). In State v. Liddell, \n277 \n\n• \nthe Court found that \"psychiatric testimony is admissible to aid a jury in \ndetermining whether there was consent to engage in a sexual act which all \nparties agree occurred. It remains up to the jury to determine whether the \nevidence is credible.\" State v. Liddell, 211 Mont. 180, 188; 685 P.2d 918, \n923 (1984). \nIn State v. Ankeny, a social worker testified in a domestic violence \ncase that it was not unusual for victims of domestic violence to recant. The \nCourt noted that the social worker \"did not offer any opinion or testimony \nrelating to the fact or parties involved in this case. Instead, the purpose of his \ntestimony was to educate the jury as to why victims of domestic violence  • \noften recant.\" State v. Ankeny, 358 Mont. 32; 243 P.3d 391, ~42 (2010). The \ndefendant in that case made a claim similar to the one being made in the case \nat bar - that the testimony went to credibility and therefore invaded the \nprovince of the jury. Id. at~41, 42, The Court noted the precedent that [t]he \ntest for admissibility of expert testimony is whether the matter is sufficiently \nbeyond common experience that the opinion of the expert will assist the trier \nof fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Id. at ~43. \nThe Court in Ankeny also looked to their holding in State v. Stringer, in \nwhich expert testimony was allowed because \n• \n278 \n\n• \nthe evidence was not offered to bolster [the wife's] testimony, but to \nprovide the jury with an explanation for the inconsistencies in her \ntestimony. Furthermore, the expert did not comment as to which of \n[the wife's] statements were more credible or offer an opinion on \nwhether [the wife] is a battered spouse. Rather, she merely provided \nthe jury with information to aid the jury in evaluating the evidence. \nThis type of limited testimony does not invade the jury's role in \ndetermining the credibility of witnesses. Ankeny at \n~44. \nProsecutors need to be prepared for the challenges experts in this \narena typically face, and need to make sure that the expert is prepared too.  It \nis imperative that the prosecutor meet with expert ahead of time, find out \nhow he or she would address any challenges, be prepared to rehabilitate the \n• \n\nexpert after cross examination if necessary . \nDefense Experts \nAlthough Mont. R. Evid. 703 permits experts to rely on inadmissible \nevidence in forming their opinions, the Montana Supreme Court has made it \nclear that Rule 703 \"does not give a witness permission to repeat \ninadmissible out-of-court statements to bolster his or her expert opinions \nbefore a jury.\" Perdue v.  Gagnon Farms, Inc., 2003 MT 47, ~ 34,314 Mont. \n303, 65 P.3d 570.  A district court should carefully evaluate the proposed \nstatements and determine pursuant to Mont. R. Evid. 401 through 403 \n•  whether the statements are relevant, and if so whether the probative value of \n279 \n\nthe evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger ofunfair prejudice.  • \nSee State v.  Van Dyken, 242 Mont. 415, 428, 791 P.2d 1350, 1358 (1990). \nIn Van Dyken, the Defendant similarly tried to avoid cross-\nexamination of his statement by offering it through his expert witness.  Van \nDyken, 242 Mont. 415 at 429, 791 P.2d at 1358-59 (1990).  The district court \nprohibited the expert from testifying to the Defendant's out of court \nstatements regarding the events surrounding his charges because they were \ninherently unreliable.  The district court explained that permitting an expert \nto \"repeat defendant's version [of the events at issue] would be to throw out \nthe other rules of evidence and to ignore the time-honored reasons for  • \nexcluding hearsay and unreliable evidence.\"  Van Dyken, 242 Mont. at 429, \n791 P.2d at 1359.  The Montana Supreme Court agreed, holding that the \ndistrict court properly exercised its discretion prohibiting this end run on the \nrules of evidence.  See Id. at 430. \nCross-Examination of the Defendant \nThe purpose of cross-examination of the defendant in a sexual assault \ncase is typically governed by the same basic principles for cross examining \nany witness at trial. Remember the defendant has a lot at stake and will \n• \nmost likely attempt to portray an account of a forcible sexual assault as \n280 \n\n• \nconsensual in nature, or that in some way the victim is accountable for what \noccurred. This is true if the defendant has not given a previous statement to \nlaw enforcement, but is equally true if the defendant provided a statement to \nlaw enforcement that may initially appear to be inculpatory. Prepare for the \nfact that the defendant's testimony may be substantially different than the \ninitial encounter with law enforcement, and inconsistent with the victim's \naccount of the assault. \nPreparation for cross-examination ofthe defendant needs to occur at \nthe earliest stages of the investigation and prosecution. The prosecutor \n• \n\nneeds to be well prepared on the rules of evidence and the techniques used \nto impeach in order to conduct a cross-examination of the defendant with \nas little interruption from the court and opposing counsel as possible. \nThe main goals of cross-examination are to: \n•  Provide favorable information for your case; \n•  Discredit unfavorable information to your case; \n•  Discredit the defendant as a witness; \n•  Discredit other defense witnesses; \n•  If necessary, establish the foundation for the later introduction of \nother evidence . \n• \n281 \n\n• \nIt is extremely likely that the testimony ofthe defendant will have \nbeen well prepared, and in addition, the defendant has had the \nopportunity to hear all of the testimony in the case and will be prepared \nto exploit any weaknesses in the State's case. This is not the time to get \ninto an argument with the defendant as to how the assault occurred. \nEvaluate the direct testimony of the defendant using these criteria: Did \nwhat the defendant said hurt the State's case? Can the damage done by \nthe defendant's direct testimony be fixed by cross- examination? Can I \nestablish favorable facts with this witness? \n• \nOften, the best approach on cross-examination is to establish \nfavorable facts already testified to by the victim. For example, in an alcohol­\nfacilitated sexual assault cross-examination should be designed to elicit \nconcessions to signs of intoxication testified to by the victim or other \nwitnesses who observed the victim's behavior before and after the assault. \nThe cross-examination should be organized by topic and needs to \nbe thoroughly prepared before the defendant testifies and written in the \nform of leading questions. It should also be conducted in a different \norganizational format from the defendant's direct testimony. For example, \n• \nin alcohol facilitated-sexual assaults, the topics could be what \n282 \n\n• \ncorroborating witnesses were present, physical layout of where the assault \ntook place, and the degree of intoxication ofthe victim. The main focus of \nthe defendant's cross-examination should be preparing for the jury to hear \nyour closing argument, establishing in advance which facts and exhibits \nsupport the conclusion you want the jury to reach. Questions should be \ndesigned and executed in such a way as to lead the jury to reach a \nconclusion. You do not want to ask the defendant to agree to the \nconclusion you want the jury to reach because it is unlikely that the \ndefendant will concede it. You will also have to be prepared for executing \n• \n alternative cross-examination questions as you force the defendant to \nchoose one path over another, or to add questions depending on how the \ndefendant and/or other witnesses testified at trial. It is also important to \nconsider that shorter cross- examinations usually have more impact. Don't \ncross-examine on everything you can. Pick out the important points that \nwill stick out in the jurors' minds. \nMaintaining Control over the Defendant \nBecause the defendant will have been well prepared to withstand \ncross- examination, control over the defendant and the examination is \n• \ncritical to its success. Control is maintained by preparation in advance, \n283 \n\ncareful planning of the words of the question posed to the defendant, and  • \nthe manner in which the question is posed by the prosecutor. \nIf the defendant is reluctant to answer the question as posed it is \nessential that the prosecutor maintain control over the defendant. The \nprimary way to maintain control over the defendant during cross-\nexamination is by asking questions that: (a ) are short, one fact questions \nthat are based on facts; (b) are not conclusions or opinions; (c) do not \nrequire the defendant to make an evaluation in answering the question; and \n(d) do not contain words that are subject to disagreement. \n•\nThe prosecutor should also maintain control over the defendant in \nthe manner the prosecutor allows the defendant to answer the question. If \nthe defendant expresses reluctance in answering the question posed, it can \ndemonstrate to the jury that the defendant is untruthful. If there is an \nescalation ofhostility between the prosecutor and the defendant during \ncross-examination it is vital that the jury becomes upset with the defendant \nand not the prosecutor. \nIf you are having difficulty with the defendant during cross-\nexamination there are a number of quick assessments you can use to see if \n• \n284 \n\n• \nthe problem that is developing can be fixed by making sure the questions \nare properly framed: \n•  Your question is not leading; \n•  Your question is too complex/multiple; \n•  You are arguing with the witness; \n•  You mischaracterize the witness's previous answer; \n•  Your questions wander and do not progress to a conclusion. \nImpeachment ofthe Defendant \nA key component of cross-examination is impeachment of the \ndefendant. The decision on whether to impeach a defendant on cross-\nexamination can be the difference between a successful cross-examination \n• \nand a failure that results in the defendant becoming credible in the minds of \nthe jury. However, impeachment should not be conducted simply for its own \nsake. \nImpeachment should be done only on an issue that is significant to \nthe case, when what the defendant is asserting is truly implausible. If there \nis a significant amount of impeachment on several minor issues such that \nthe number impacts the defendant's overall credibility, a longer cross-\nexamination may be warranted . \n• \n285 \n\nKeep in mind that the defendant will have an opportunity to address  • \nthe impeachment on redirect examination through his attorney. Familiarity \nwith the evidentiary rules for the basis of impeachment is also essential. \nExecution of the impeachment needs to be flawless in order to be \nsuccessful. \nEthical rules require that prosecutors be fair to the opposing \nparty and counsel, and only ask questions that anticipate an answer for \nwhich there is good faith basis to believe will be admissible at trial. \nEvidence of Defendant's \"Good Character\" \n• \nLimiting the number of character witnesses a defendant may call in \nsupport of his character is a proper exercise of the Court's discretion.  Loux \nv.  United States, 389 F.2d 911, 917 (9th Cir. 1968).  In Goggans v.  Winkley, \n159 Mont. 85,495 P.2d 594 (1972), despite the defendant's objections that \nthe defendant would be unduly and unfairly prejudiced if the court limited \nthe number of character witnesses he could call from five to three, the court \nrestricted the number of character witnesses the defendant was able to call to \nthree finding that such a number was sufficient.  Id.,  159 Mont. at 93. \n• \n286 \n\n• \nMontana Rule of Evidence 404(a), generally excludes evidence of a \nperson's character for proving action in conformity therewith.  The rule allows \nan exception for a defendant to present evidence of a \"pertinent trait of \ncharacter\" to support an inference that he did not commit the offense.  Rule \n405 established the manner in which that testimony may be presented: by \ntestimony as to reputation or testimony in the form of an opinion. Therefore, \ntestimony that the Defendant is a generally good guy, for example, is irrelevant \nunder Rule 403 to a pertinent character trait, has no nexus to sexual assault, \nand does not constitute reputation or opinion testimony under Rule 405.  The \n• \n Montana Supreme Court has held that it is improper to allow the Defendant to \nquestion character witnesses on the ultimate issue ofthe Defendant's guilt. \nState v. Smith, 1998 MT 257,291 Mont. 236, 967 P.2d 424.  Specifically, the \nopinion testimony in Smith that was held to be properly prohibited was that, \ndue to his good character, he was not capable of committing the offense.  Id. \nIn Smith, the Court also noted its caution against allowing an expert to \ngive an opinion which, \"instead ofbeing an opinion embracing an ultimate \nissue of fact, amounts to an opinion of guilt or innocence embracing all \nissues.\"  Smith, 291 Mont. at, 240, 967 P.2d at 427 (citations omitted).  The \nCourt notes that caution \"applies even more to opinions of non-expert\n• \n287 \n\n• \nwitnesses that, ordinarily, more prejudice than benefit is likely to be gained \nfrom such opinion testimony.\"  Id., 291 Mont. at 24l.  The Court cited \nMontana Rule of Evidence 70 I, stating that it has \"held that lay witnesses \nmay offer their opinions as long as those opinions are based on the \nwitnesses' own observations.\"  Id (citing State v. Henricks, 201 Mont. 157, \n164,653 P.2d 479, 482(1982)). \nAs noted above, Rule 404( a) requires character evidence to be \npertinent to the charge.  Many states differ on whether or not truthfulness or \nveracity is a pertinent character trait in a sexual assault, but the only \nMontana case on point holds that it is.  State v. Anderson, 211 Mont. 272,  • \n686 P .2d 193 (1984).  It is clear that any other character traits must be \npertinent to some aspect of sexual assault.  In State v. Harper,  670 P.2d 296 \n(Wn. App. 1983) review denied 100 Wash. 2d 1035 (1984), the Court held \nthat a defendant's character trait for truthfulness was not a pertinent trait to \nthe charge of indecent liberties under Rule 404(a)(1) and, more importantly, \nstated that the only pertinent traits were sexual morality and decency. \nIn most cases, the only pertinent character traits in a good character \ndefense are veracity and traits that fall into the realm of \"sexual morality and \ndecency.\"  Specific instances of good conduct are irrelevant in a Sexual \n• \n288 \n\n• \nIntercourse without Consent case.  General opinions ofthe Defendant's \nmoral character or standing in the community are likewise irrelevant on the \nissue ofwhether or not he would commit the charged offense. \nCountering Common Defenses to Sexual Assault \nThere are a variety of defenses commonly seen in sexual assault \ncases. At the crux ofmany of these defenses is the implication that the \nvictim is lying about being sexually assaulted. This is tied to the myth that \nthere are a high number of false reports of sexual assault. The defense may \nuse a variety of explanations to argue why the victim is lying about being \n• \n\nassaulted, however, they are mostly variations on a single theme - that the \nvictim's claim of sexual assault is false. These defenses place the focus \nsquarely on the victim, and when combined with other rape myths that \nblame the victim for her vulnerability (i.e. drinking alcohol/using drugs, a \nhistory of mental illness, lack of fighting back, consented to certain \nactivities, etc.) they serve to diminish the credibility of the victim. \n\"He Said/She Said\" Cases \nOne common refrain from defense attorneys is that sexual assault \n•  cases are simply classified as \"he said/she said\" cases. The implication of \n289 \n\n• \nthis defense is that the \"only\" evidence ofthe assault is the victim's own \nstatement, which has been contradicted by the defendant. Some ofthis is a \nresult ofthe nature ofthe crime itself; there are rarely witnesses to the \nsexual assault because offenders tend to not assault their victims in front of \nothers. This enhances the importance of the victim's story, and again \nallows the defense to focus on the victim's behavior, and in particular \nthose actions that depart from how we expect a \"real\" victim to behave. \nThe \"he said/she said\" problem occurs most often in cases in which: \n(a) the victim knows the offender; (b) there is a lack ofphysical evidence; \n• \n\nor (c) the physical evidence does not prove the elements ofthe crime. The \ndefense will often argue that the lack ofphysical evidence, particularly in \nregard to injury, bruising, or tearing, equals reasonable doubt. This plays \ninto the common belief that a \"real\" sexual assault victim is one who \nsustains serious physical injuries. The reality is, however, that most victims \ndo not experience physical injuries, apart from the sexual assault itself. \nEven in cases in which there is physical evidence of sexual activity, (semen \nfor example) that evidence is no different than what would be left behind by \nconsensual sexual activity. \n• \n290 \n\n• \nIn these types of cases, lack of consent is the crucial element the \nprosecutor must prove. Unfortunately, the legal definition of consent \nputs the focus squarely on the victim, and this plays into the defense's \nattempts to portray the case as \"he said/she said.\" Despite these \nchallenges, there are some ways in which a prosecutor can overcome \nthe \"he said/she said\" problem: \n• \t Look for ways to corroborate the victim's story. Taking a broad \nview of corroboration can be helpful. Although it may not be \npossible to corroborate the assault itself, what other facts else can \nthe investigation corroborate about the victims story? Can the \ntimeline of the events leading up to and after the assault be \n• \n\ncorroborated? What about the demeanor of the victim? These are \njust a few examples ofways in which the victim's story can be \ncorroborated. The more corroboration, the less the case is a \"he \nsaid/she said\" case. \n• \t It is also possible that the defendant will corroborate much of the \nvictim's story as well. Particularly in cases in which consent is the \ndefense, the defendant may corroborate many of the facts leading \nup to and after the assault. If the defendant admits to many ofthe \nfacts but for the one that would convict him - consent - it opens \nthe defendant up to attack on cross examination. \n• \t Consider calling an expert witness to address the confusing myths \nand misinformation constructed by defense attorneys. Expert \ntestimony can help dispel some of the rape myths so that the jury \navoids making a decision based on those myths or misconceptions . \n• \n291 \n\n• \nOvercoming the False Report Myth \nOne of the most common rape myths about sexual assault is that \nthere is a high incidence of false reports. One of the most frequently cited \nstudies on the false reporting of sexual assaults, the Kanin study, asserted \nthat the 41 % of sexual assault reports made to a Midwestern police agency \nwere deemed to be false over a nine year period. This study has \nsubsequently come under attack, and as noted in Chapter 2, more \nmethodologically rigorous research indicates that the percentage of false \nreports is actually somewhere between 2-8%. In other words, the incidence \nof false reports for sexual assault cases is no higher than for any other \n• \n\ncnme. \nThe key point is that when the facts of a sexual assault are \ninconsistent with the expectations about what a \"real\" sexual assault looks \nlike, there is a tendency in our society to view these cases with heightened \nsuspicion. The defense will exploit these myths and argue to the jury that \nbecause the facts ofthe particular case do not meet our societal \nexpectation of what a \"real\" sexual assault should look like; it must be that \nthe victim is lying about the assault. \n• \n292 \n\n• \nThe traumatic nature of a sexual assault has a direct impact on how \na victim discloses the incident. Additionally, the rape myths that exist in \nour society may cause a victim to experience high levels of guilt and \nshame because the assault did not conform to the societal expectations of \nwhat a \"real\" rape looks like (i.e. non-stranger offender, no injures/weapon \nused, victim did not resist). \nThis self-blame may cause the victim to change the details of the \nassault to make it sound more like the stereotype. While this can present \nserious problems for the prosecution in terms ofvictim credibility, one of \n• \nthe key strategies to overcome this challenge is to view the omissions, \ninconsistencies, and perhaps even untrue \nstatements as understandable. In no way \nshould these \"problems\" be confused with a \ncan  .....  ..........  . \nfalse report. Layered reporting is also \n;~:!:il{/::::iJ;o) \ncommon, and can lead to opportunities for \nvictim cretlibility~ On'tf;ojii' \n.  .  1 \nthe \ndefense attorneys to exploit what they  ki!l~stl:·ate'i!:.te, \nbelieve are inconsistent statements.

Other strategies that can be used to overcome the false \nreport defense: \n• \t Prosecutors can avoid inconsistent statements made by the victim by \nutilizing the professional expertise of a Sexual Assault Response \nTeam (SART) during the investigation. A SART is a \nmultidisciplinary response team (comprised of advocates, law \nenforcement, sexual assault nurse examiners and prosecution) that \nprovides direct intervention to sexual assault victims as they interact \nwith the criminal justice system and coordinates effective \ninvestigative and prosecutorial efforts in connection with a report of \nsexual assault.\" Participation in a SART   may reduce the number of \nunnecessary professional contacts a victim has during the \ninvestigation and therefore, reduce the likelihood of inconsistent \n• \n\nstatements \n• \t Vertical prosecution is another strategy that will reduce inconsistent \nstatements. With vertical prosecution, victims are able to work with \nthe same prosecutor and investigator from the time potential charges \nare first reviewed through the sentencing of the offender. Vertical \nprosecution reduces the number of persons the victim has to share \nher story with, thereby reducing the likelihood of inconsistent \nstatements. Vertical prosecution has also been shown to improve \nconviction rates, reduce victim trauma, and provide more consistent, \nappropriate sentencing. It is therefore considered best practice. \n• \t Prosecutors can also overcome the false report myth by \ncorroborating as many details of the victims account ofthe incident. \nCorroboration will highlight the accuracy of the victim's story and \nthus bolster her/his credibility.  • \n294 \n\n• \n•  Finally, the prosecutor could consider using an expert witness to \neducate juries on rape myths as well as specific information about \ntrauma and its impact on memory and disclosure. \nLack ofPhysical Injury \nSociety expects that a victim will physically resist a sexual assault \nimplies that jurors and judges expect to see injuries in a true sexual assault. \nProfessionals who are educated about victim responses know that physical \ninjuries are rare and that 70% ofthe time there are no injuries and 24% of \nthe time there are minor injuries. Only 4% ofvictims ofsexual assault have \nserious physical injuries. Many cases involve minor physical injuries or \nphysical findings consistent with, but not specific for, sexual assault. \n• \n\nIt is also important to stress that sexual assault is a profound injury \nby itself. Psychological injury experienced by sexual victims is often \noverlooked or devalued. It is imperative for judges to know the destructive \nquality and the extended length of this psychological injury so that \noffenders can receive appropriate sentences. Witnesses close to the victim \nwho can describe a before/after view ofthe victim can be critical in \nhelping corroborate the victim's statement and making the impact ofthe \nassault clear to the judge at sentencing. \nThe Consent Defense \n• \n295 \n\n• \nPerhaps the most common defense, particularly in non-stranger \nassault cases, is the consent defense. This is also known as the \"rape is not \nregret\" defense, or in other words, the victim engaged in, but now regrets, \nthe consensual sexual activity with the defendant. This defense may be \nparticularly common in cases in which the victim knows her offender. In \nthis strategy, the defense claims that in an effort to avoid being caught \ncheating on an intimate partner, or taking responsibility for engaging in \nsexual activity outside the relationship, the victim instead claims that she \nwas sexually assaulted. \n• \n\nWhat make these cases so difficult are the various rape myths that \nlead jurors to believe that these cases do not look like \"real\" sexual assault. \nGiven that the consent defense is most common in cases in which the \nvictim knows that defendant, we are already dealing with the myth that the \ndefendant does not conform to the cultural belief what an offender looks \nlike. Furthermore, even if there is DNA evidence, it is not helpful in \nproving an assault occurred. \nDefense attorneys will likely portray these cases as \"he said/she \nsaid\" cases, as described previously. Additionally, the defense will focus \n• \non the victim's behavior, particularly behaviors that contradict the rape \n296 \n\n• \nmyths that are pervasive in our culture - i.e. delayed reporting, lack of \ninjury, no weapon involved in the assault - and they will use these myths \nto attack the victim's credibility. \nc~j§'e~t\\r#:jeltse cases \nUnfortunately, the statutory \nre,t!,tjlli;'inore time and. \nto prosecute; \nr~sources \ndefinition of consent invites this focus \nsuccessfullY;h~heJ'will  l.;~' \nrequire ide~!ifyiitgthe faB~i \non the victim's behavior.

They will require identifying the rape myths implicated by  • \nthe facts of the case, and then figuring out how to go about refuting them. \nThey will require educating the jury, beginning in voir dire, so that they do \nnot view these cases through a lens of ignorance brought about by the \ncultural stereotypes surrounding sexual assault. Victims will require a \nsignificant amount ofpreparation, particularly in terms of responding to \nquestions around rape myths, such as why the victim didn't report right \naway. The prosecutor will need to be very familiar with the investigation, \nand may need to ask for follow-up investigation to corroborate as many \nfacts as possible. Without corroborative details, the jury is more likely to  • \nbuy the defense's \"he said/she said\" argument. \nConnect the Victim to Advocates \nVictims of sexual assault have internalized many of the rape myths \nthat exist in our society. As a result, sexual assault victims may experience \nself-blame, guilt, and shame after the assault. Victims of sexual assault also \nfear the loss ofprivacy that often accompanies an individual's experience \nwith the criminal justice system. Finally, victims will have to deal with the \nconsequences of the assault long after the criminal justice process has run \nits course.  • \n298 \n\n• \nAs a result, it is vitally important that the victim be linked with \nsupportive services during the criminal justice process. A victim advocate \nis protected by privilege in Montana, which may help address some ofthe \nvictim's privacy concerns. \nUse Pre-Trial Strategies \nTo challenge the consent defense, prosecutors can also protect the \nvictim's privacy through pretrial motions and prepare the victim for \ntestimony - both direct testimony and cross examination. This includes \nprepping the victim for rape myth questions as well as addressing any \n• \n\ninconsistencies that exist in the case . \nPractice Offender-Focused Prosecution \nOne of the main ways a prosecutor can overcome the consent defense \n- and the inevitable defense focus on the victim - is to develop an \noffender-focused prosecution. One ofthe best ways to do this is to develop \nan offender-focused theme to the case. The theme ofthe case is a one­\nsentence statement which represents the thrust of your evidence. It is the \nprosecutor's read on the human dynamics in the case, or on why the \ndefendant is guilty.  \n• \n299 \n\n• \nAlthough the theme will often depend on the facts of the particular \ncase, there are some key traits of sex offenders that may be useful in \ndeveloping an offender-focused theme. For example sex offenders target \ntheir victims based on vulnerability. This vulnerability often presents a \nchallenge for the prosecutor in the form of credibility issues. However, an \noffender-focused prosecution will take some of the weaknesses/bad facts in \nthe case - which are often about the victim - and demonstrate that these \nare precisely the reasons that the offender targeted the victim for the assault. \nAs a result, the prosecutor embraces some ofthe weaknesseslbad facts and \nturns them into good facts and a strong case. Examples of strategies  • \nprosecutors can use to keep the focus on the defendant include: \n•  Defendant is  a predator -- This keeps the focus  squarely on the \n\ndefendant, and portrays the victim as a true victim, rather than one \n\nwho contributed to the defendant's acts.  However, be aware that \n\nusing  the  term  \"predator\"  could,  in  some  courts,  be  seen  as \n\nobjectionable.  In  some  courts,  it  may  be  safer  to  argue  the \n\ndefendant abused his power or betrayed the victim's trust to get the \n\npoint that he is a predator across to the jury without drawing an \n\nobjection or risking a mistrial. \n\n•  Defendant is a manipulator -- This presents the defendant as a \n\nperson who knew full well what he was doing every step of the way. \n\nAll of his actions were directed toward the same goal - sexual \n\nassault. \n\n•  Defendant is an opportunist -- While sexual assaults are \npremeditated crimes, there may be cases in which the facts or the \n• \nnature of the defendant don't lend themselves to portraying the \n300 \n\n• \ndefendant as a predator or manipulator . \nThis may be particularly true in cases in  Cor1toborqtton \nwhich the defendant is likely to appear to \np~(Je \nthe jury as sympathetic. In these situations, \nthe prosecutor can portray the defendant as \nsomeone who exploited a situation and \nassaulted the victim. This allows the jury to \nconvict the defendant even ifthey don't \nbelieve the assault was \"planned.\" \nCorroboration \nCorroboration is probably the prosecutor's best friend in a consent \ndefense case. As part of the analysis ofthe case, the prosecutor should \ndevelop a time line that includes everything leading up to the assault, \nincluding what the victim and offender did after the assault. The \n• \nprosecutor should then corroborate as many facts as possible to bolster the \nvictim's credibility. This includes what is often called micro \ncorroboration, which includes even the smallest details of her report. Even \nthese small details can help build the credibility of the victim. During this \nprocess, the prosecutor may determine that there needs to be additional \ninvestigation. While some of this may occur before filing the complaint, \ncorroboration should not stop once the complaint is filed. Although certain \navenues of investigation may be cut off once the complaint is filed, such as \ninterviewing the suspect, the prosecutor should not cease trying to \ncorroborate as many facts as possible leading up to trial. \n• \n301 \n\n•\nPotential Areas of Corroboration \n• \t Victim's Post-Assault Behavior - What did the victim do after the \nassault? Who did she talk to? What was her demeanor? This type \n\nof evidence can help establish that something traumatic happened. \n\nDid the victim develop problems in school, work, or in her \n\nrelationships? Any of this evidence may help corroborate that the \n\nvictim was sexually assaulted, because the victim could not fake \n\nthese after-effects. \n\n• \t SANE Exam - Although injuries in sexual assault cases are \n\nuncommon, any injury discovered by a SANE exam should be used, \n\nno matter how small. Additionally, a victim who had a SANE exam \n\nmay help counter the implication that she is lying. A SANE exam is \n\nan extremely lengthy and intrusive procedure, and the prosecutor \n\nmay be able to elicit these facts in a way that refutes the implication \n\nthat someone would put themselves through such an exam without a \n\nvalid reason. \n\n• \t Expert Witnesses - An expert witness can corroborate the victim's \nbehavior by comparing it to other known victims of sexual assault. \nThis evidence is often termed \"counterintuitive victim behavior\" \nevidence, and it helps disabuse the jury of common misconceptions \nabout sexual assault victims. This type of expert testimony is  • \nadmissible in Wisconsin.' Advocates who work with sexual assault \nvictims can be valuable resources for expert testimony. \n• \t Details - Details provide concrete evidence as to the facts of a sexual \n\nassault. Prosecutors should strive to provide and corroborate as many \n\ndetails as possible, including: (a) photos of the crime scene and photos \n\nof any injuries; (b) statements from any witnesses before or after the \n\nassault; and (c) any other detail, no matter how small! Above all, be \n\ncreative and think big picture. \n\nOther Potential Defenses \nAlthough the list below is not exhaustive, it does represent some of \nthe more common defenses a prosecutor may encounter in sexual assault \ncases: \n• \n302 \n\n• \n•  The victim is trying to cover up for \nIfthe pYQseeutof<is(l,D,le\nher bad behavior \nto demonstrate tl.ht'iiii'  ' \npreCisajJfl},caua~\"\"'>', \n•  The victim is looking for revenge \nvictim~Jf~qs vu \n'.' ilhe wu,s,targ \n•  The victim is a \"gold digger.\" \n.~~:\"~,/:;:~iic~ \n•  The victim is looking for attention \nfoc~i~d d:/\"  will \n'1$ \n•  The victim is exchanging sex for \n;\nlJ~~somfl:o;\ndrugs \n~J,pact. \nThese defenses represent further \nattempts to shift the focus to the victim's behavior. A prosecutor who \nhas engaged in the good factlbad fact analysis as described above may \n• \nidentify some ofthese potential defenses early on in the case. After \nperforming an evidentiary analysis of these potential defenses, there \nmay be pre-trial motions the prosecutor can file to limit these potential \ndefenses. \nAdditionally, an offender-focused prosecution can also help ensure \nthat the focus is not squarely on the victim. As discussed above, \noffenders target their victims based on vulnerability. While this \nvulnerability often presents challenges for the prosecution in terms of \ncredibility, if the prosecutor is able to demonstrate that it is precisely \n•  because the victim was vulnerable that she/he was targeted for \n303 \n\n• \nvictimization, some ofthese more victim-\nS~~ojlendirs'4r~;. \nmq~!~t~dJJy(~dbsire to \nfocused defenses will lose some oftheir \n~~rtp'{)wer.and;:: . \ndomt\"nation over their,  impact. \nvictt\"ms.

Obviously, our \nstatutory definitions of sexual intercourse and sexual contact broaden the \ndefinition of sexual assault to include acts other than penis/vagina \n• \n\npenetration (i.e. oral intercourse, digital penetration, etc.). Keeping the \nfocus on the statutory definition of sexual assault, which includes other \nnon-consensual sexual acts helps to limit the impact of this defense. \nAdditionally, sex offenders are motivated by a desire to exert power and \ndomination over their victims. While there is a sexual component to their \nbehavior, sex offenders are aroused by sexually deviant stimuli in which \nthey take advantage of the victim's vulnerability. Thus the fact that the \ndefendant is impotent does not negate his ability to be aroused by \nsexually deviant stimuli. \n• \n304 \n\n• \nClosing Argument and Rebuttal \nYour closing argument is also prepared before the trial begins and \nshould carry through the themes that were developed throughout the \nentire trial and lead the jury to return a verdict of guilty on the charges \nthat are being tried. Many ofthe techniques about style and presentation \nthat are contained in the section regarding opening statements are \nequally applicable in closing statements. \nYour primary objective in closing is to get and keep the jury's \nattention. The themes that were developed throughout the trial are now \n• \nbrought together and repeated again for the jury as the facts support the \ntheme and theory. Now is the time to argue what the jury knows to be the \ncase based on the evidence that was presented, and how that evidence \nmeets the elements of the charges that the jury is considering. Remind the \njury by showing them again the particular pieces of evidence that establish \nand corroborate the assault as recounted by the victim during the trial. \nEmphasize  portions  of testimony,  exhibits  and  other  evidence \nwhich forcefully and succinctly establish the guilt of the defendant and \n•  do so in a manner that is consistent with your style and personality \n305 \n\n• \nConsider whether to save elaboration on some arguments for \nrebuttal based on what you expect the defendant to argue in the defendant's \nreply. A strong opening in rebuttal with an emphasis that refocuses the \njury's attention on the defendant's conduct will add to a strong rebuttal. \n• \n• \n306 \n\n• \nChapter 9 \nISSUES IN PLEA AGREEMENTS AND \nSENTENCING IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES55 \nPlea agreements are a necessary and important part of the criminal \njustice system. Without them, prosecutors would be able to pursue only a \nsmall fraction of the cases they prosecute. \nPlea agreements provide certainty to \nvictims, allow traumatized victims to avoid \nthe difficulties involved with testifying at \n•  trial, and foreclose most lengthy appeal and \ncases:t~~jpr .. \npost-conviction proceedings. In Santobello  Pleli  .,' \nv. New York, 404 U.S. 260 (1971), the \nSupreme Court characterized the \nnegotiation ofplea agreements as \"an  ':ati  .... \nforec \n.:!\"ost l'f~.ft~:· \nessential component of the administration of \njustice\" that is \"to be encouraged.\" \n55 Portions of this chapter were excerpted and modified with pennission from: the Michigan Prosecutors Sexual Assault \n• \nProsecution Manual, published by the Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention and Treatment Board and the \nProsecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan (2013); and the Wisconsin Sexual Assault Reference Book, published \nby the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance (2009). \n307 \n\n• \nPlea agreements are contracts and are generally governed \nby contract principles. State v. Rardon, 2005 MT 129,327 Mont. 228, 115 \nP.3d 182.  However, a plea agreement is a unique kind of contract. It is \nan agreement between a prosecutor and a defendant for the sole purpose of \nsettling a pending criminal charge, or charges, against the defendant. See \nSection 46-12-211, MeA. Unlike other contracts, a plea agreement is not \nself-executing; it is contingent on approval by the court. The court is not \nbound by a plea agreement, and it may be accepted or rejected, in whole or \nin part. Upon sentencing, a plea agreement terminates. That is, once each \nparty has fulfilled its obligations under the agreement (each party has  • \nperformed), the plea agreement has served its purpose and any duties under \nthe contract are discharged. The controlling document becomes the \njudgment and sentence, which embodies the plea agreement in whatever \nform the court accepted. Ronning v.  Yellowstone County, 2011 MT 79; 360 \nMont. 108; 253 P.3d 818. \nSection 46-12-204 MCA  Plea alternatives. \n(1) A defendant may plead guilty, not guilty, or, with the consent of \nthe court and the prosecutor, nolo contendere.

If the defendant \nprevails on appeal, the defendant must be allowed to withdraw the \nplea. \n(4) The court may not accept a plea of nolo contendere in a case \ninvolving a sexual offense, as defined in Section 46-23-502, except an \n• \n offense under Section 45-5-301 through 45-5-303. \nSection 46-12-211MCA  Plea agreement procedure \n(1) The prosecutor and the attorney for the defendant, or the defendant \nwhen acting pro se, may engage in discussions with a view toward \nreaching an agreement that, upon the entering of a plea of guilty or \nnolo contendere to a charged offense or to a lesser or related offense, \nthe prosecutor will do any of the following: \n(a) move for dismissal of other charges; \n(b) agree that a specific sentence is the appropriate disposition of \nthe case; or \n(c) make a recommendation, or agree not to oppose the \ndefendant's request, for a particular sentence, with the understanding \n•  that the recommendation or request may not be binding upon the \ncourt. \n309 \n\n•\n(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (5), if a plea agreement has \nbeen reached by the parties, the court shall, on the record, require a \ndisclosure ofthe agreement in open court or, on a showing of good \ncause in camera, at the time that the plea is offered. If the agreement is \nof the type specified in subsection (1 )(a) or (1 )(b), the court may \naccept or reject the agreement or may defer its decision as to the \nacceptance or rejection until there has been an opportunity to consider \nthe presentence report. If the agreement is of the type specified in \nsubsection (1)( c), the court shall advise the defendant that, if the court \ndoes not accept the recommendation or request, the defendant \nnevertheless has no right to withdraw the plea. \n(3) If the court accepts a plea agreement, the court shall inform the \ndefendant that it will embody in the judgment and sentence the \ndisposition provided for in the plea agreement. \n(4) Ifthe court rejects a plea agreement ofthe type specified in  • \nsubsection (l)(a) or (l)(b), the court shall, on the record, inform the \nparties of this fact and advise the defendant that the court is not bound \nby the plea agreement, afford the defendant an opportunity to \nwithdraw the plea, and advise the defendant that ifthe defendant \npersists in the guilty or nolo contendere plea, the disposition ofthe \ncase may be less favorable to the defendant than that contemplated by \nthe plea agreement. \n(5) For purposes of this section, a disclosure ofthe agreement through \nthe use of two-way electronic audio-video communication, allowing \nall of the participants to be heard in the courtroom by all present and \nallowing the party speaking to be seen, is considered to be a \ndisclosure in open court. Audio-video communication may be used if \nneither party objects and the court agrees to its use and has informed \nthe defendant that the defendant has the right to object to its use. The \n• \naudio-video communication must operate as provided in 46-12-20l. \n310 \n\n• \nSection 46-12-212 MeA Determining accuracy orplea. \n(1) The court may not accept a guilty plea without determining that \nthere is a factual basis for the plea in charges of felonies or \nmisdemeanors resulting in incarceration. \n(2) A defendant who is unwilling to admit to any element ofthe \noffense that would provide a factual basis for a plea of guilty may, \nwith the consent of the court, enter a plea of guilty or may, with the \nconsent of the court and the prosecutor, enter a plea of nolo \ncontendere to the offense if the defendant considers the plea to be in \nthe defendant's best interest and the court determines that there is a \nfactual basis for the plea. \nConsulting with the Victim \nProsecutors should meet with the victim and discuss plea negotiations \n• \n\nwhen a decision to prosecute has been made. One important consideration in \na prosecutor's initial meeting with the victim is ascertaining the unique \nperspectives of individual victims, whether there are particular safety issues \nthat will need to be addressed at \ntJ;'~ lniportallt cOllsideratioll \nsentencing, collateral issues for victim,  in aprosecutor's \nUlZlIUI,· \nmeeting witltthe.vlctlttl \nand the impact the case and criminal  ascertaining \nprocess on the victim. \nwill need to be addfe~~edat \nA victim-centered response \n$e~t~nci~g,(:oIIiite~aI issues . \niQ;~lh8.~·J#etim, alld the \nprioritizes the participation of victims in \ntmp4~it~e case anderiminal \n• \npriiCi!s~;,;~;,.t#etvi(:tim~. \n311 \n\n• \ndeciding the State's recommendation for the outcome. A victim-centered \nresponse includes explaining the rationale for seeking a plea agreement and \nasking the victims for their feedback when negotiation options are being \nconsidered. Minimally, the prosecutor should: \n• \t Educate the victim about the impact that the defendant's decision to \n\nplead other than not guilty would have on the process and the \n\npotential outcome. \n\n• \t Discuss plea agreement options with the victim and solicit their \n\nfeedback about what the prosecution is \n\nVictim:s' should be aware \nseeking. \n\nthat'the:plea agreement \nis' / \n('I}ll!tJcis~  •  Keep the victim informed of what \n'tliat\\i~sues '.  plea agreement is being offered to the  •\ndefendant before any plea agreement offer \nmajarise duringtl'~ri.;! \nis made.

Make sure she/he is aware that while their \n\nthoughts and opinions are very important, and will be given due \n\nconsideration, ultimately it is up to the prosecutor to determine the \n\noptimal way to proceed with plea agreement negotiations. \n\nVictims should be aware that the plea agreement negotiation process \nis fluid, and that issues may arise during the course of the case that may \nimpact or change negotiation strategies. The victim should be aware that the \nplea offer may change based upon these new factors. The impact of the new \n• \n312 \n\n• \nfactors should be addressed with the victim, before modification ofthe offer. \nA plea offer on a sexual assault case should never be presented to a \ndefendant without first attempting to contact the victim. \nOffender-Focused Approach \nThe prosecutor should also approach plea agreement negotiations \nfrom an offender-focused perspective. This includes consideration ofthe \nneed for: \n• \t The offender to be subject to Sex Offender Registration; \n• \t Prison/punishment; \n• \n\n• \t Sex offender treatment - as part of a probation term or prison term as \na condition of sentence; \n• \t Specific deterrence - sending a message to the defendant that the \nconduct will not be tolerated \nAn offender-focused approach to plea negotiations that carefully \nconsiders all of the offender's actions, behaviors and character is consistent \nwith best practice. Any history of sex offenses or other crimes should be \nfully considered when determining a possible outcome through negotiations. \nAn offender-focused approach does not end at conviction; it continues \nthrough sentencing, where the prosecutor can and should advocate for a \n• \n313 \n\n•\nsentence that accurately reflects the true nature of the offense and the \noffender. \nReviewing the Sexual Offender Evaluation \nSection 46-l8-lll(I)(b) MeA requires that the Pre-Sentence \nInvestigation and report of a defendant convicted of a sex crime include a \npsychosexual evaluation of the defendant and a recommendation as to \ntreatment of the defendant in the least restrictive environment, considering \nthe risk the defendant presents to the community and defendant's needs, \nunless the defendant is subject to mandatory life without release. \n• \nThe evaluation must be completed by a sex offender therapist who is a \nmember ofthe Montana Sex Offender Treatment Association or has \ncomparable credentials acceptable to the department of labor and industry. \nThe assessment of sexual offenders involves performing a \ncomprehensive psychiatric evaluation, reviewing available police reports \nand criminal history, and contacting available collateral sources of \ninformation to verify information provided by the defendant. \nIf a Sexual Offender Evaluation has been provided to the State prior to \na plea of guilty or prior to a plea agreement being negotiated, the prosecutor \n• \n314 \n\n• \nshould carefully review the evaluation and determine its impact on plea \nnegotiations. \nWhen receiving a sexual offender evaluation report, the prosecutor \nshould determine the following: \n• \t Whether the report prepared in accordance with the MSOT A \nStandards for Evaluation and Ongoing Assessment ofAdult Sexual \nOffenders (see msota.org). \n• \t Whether the evaluator contacted collateral sources to verify the \ninformation provided by the defendant. \n• \t Whether, pursuant to the evaluation, the defendant is amendable to \ntreatment \n• \n\n• \t Whether a tier level indicating whether the defendant is a low, \n\nmoderate, or high risk to reoffend. \n\nPlea Agreement Limitations \nProsecutors have the discretion to resolve cases according to the \nstrength ofthe evidence, the victim's needs and wishes, community safety \nconcerns, and the individual facts and circumstances of each case and each \noffender. However, in recognition ofthe fact that: 1) most sex offenders are \nserial offenders; 2) treatment is ineffective ifthe offenders refuse to admit \ntheir conduct; 3) sexual offenses are serious criminal offenses; and 4) \n• \nvictims and the community as a whole need to see sexual offenses treated \n315 \n\n• \nseriously and as consistently as possible, some limitations on plea \nagreements are appropriate. \nThe prosecutor shall not enter into a deferred prosecution agreement \non a sexual assault case unless extraordinary circumstances exist and the \nCounty Attorney agrees to and signs off on the agreement. If approved, a \nmemo must be place in the file explaining the rationale for the agreement. \nThe prosecutor shall not amend a sexual assault charge to a non­\nsexual assault offense (i.e. criminal endangerment) pursuant to a plea \nagreement without the permission of the supervising attorney. If approved a \nmemo must be placed in the file explaining the rational for the amended  • \ncharge. \nThe prosecutor shall not amend a felony offense to a misdemeanor \noffense pursuant to a plea agreement without the permission of the \nsupervising attorney. If approved a memo must be placed in the file \nexplaining the rational for the amendment to a misdemeanor charge. \nThe prosecutor shall not enter into a plea agreement that allows the \ndefendant to enter a plea of nolo contendere in a case involving a sexual \n• \n316 \n\n• \noffense, as defined in Section 46-23-502, except an offense under Section \n45-5-301 through 45-5-303. \nThe prosecutor shall not enter into a plea agreement that calls for a \nrecommendation for deferred imposition of sentence, where allowed by \nstatute, unless extenuating circumstances exist and the supervising attorney \nhas approved the agreement. If approved a memo must be placed in the file \nexplaining the rational for the recommendation of the deferred imposition of \nsentence. \nThe prosecutor shall not enter into an agreement that allows the \n• \n\ndefendant to plead to a sexual assault offense pursuant to an Alford Plea, \nunless extenuating circumstances exist and the supervising attorney has \napproved the agreement. If approved a memo must be placed in the file \nexplaining the rationale for allowing the defendant to plead via an Alford \nplea. See North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1971) . \n• \n317 \n\nChapter 10  • \nCOORDINATION WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS \nThe community's response to sexual violence directly impacts when, \nwhere and how a victim seeks medical and legal help, the victim's trust in \nand cooperation with the criminal justice  AI'l,MDTisa \ncqliafjolattdltiJ.f \nprocess, and the extent to which the offender  rf!pre*{(tlt·~  ~ \nv,a  ri'O.

The MDT approach is a community-based \n318 \n\n• \nproblem solving approach.  An MDT is a collaboration of representatives \nfrom various organizations in the community that works to evaluate and \nimprove the overall criminal justice systems response to sexual assault \ncrimes, and/or as a case processing and evaluation tool in individual sexual \nassault cases moving through the criminal justice system. The individual \nmembers of an MDT have different roles, but each contributes to the others' \nwork. \nStudies of communities with active, well-functioning MDTs have \nrevealed many improvements to the response to sexual assault, including: \n• \n•  Better, more victim-centered care for victims in the acute stage; \n•  An increase in the number of victims coming forward for help; \n• \t More requests for advocacy services by victims after the acute \nstage; \n• \t More medical and mental health follow-up services accessed by \nvictims after the acute response; \n• \t Better quality of evidence collection and a more consistent use of \nevidence and expert witness testimony during prosecution; \n• \t An increased percentage ofvictims reporting their assault to law \nenforcement; \n• \t Victims expressing greater satisfaction with the acute care they \nreceived from medical personnel and law enforcement, as well as a \n• \n319 \n\ngreater confidence in the legal system's ability to achieve a form of  • \njustice for them; \n•  More law enforcement cases referred to the prosecutor for review; \n•  More cases ending in findings of guilty.\n56 \nIn similar research, the American Prosecutors Research \nInstitutelNational District Attorneys Association confirmed that the \nSANE/SART intervention model is a valuable tool in the criminal justice \nsystem's ability to effectively respond to adult sexual assault cases.  One \nfinding of particular note was the importance ofthe SANE/SART   \nintervention in collecting and preserving valuable \nMissoula';Jttjs a· \n•\nevidence for prosecution, including DNA evidence.  lonl/~tandingMl)T \n1I!::~~iftJ;\nto . \nMissoula's Collaborative Response - the Just \nResponse MDT \nMissoula has a longstanding MDT which \nresponds to adult and child sexual assault. In acknowledgment of the fact \nthat historically, the criminal justice system's response to sexual assault \nmirrored the larger community response and often re-victimized those whom \nit is supposed to protect, the MDT was developed through the efforts of a \n56 \nOregon Attorney General's Sexual Assault Task Force, SART Handbook, p.2 \n• \n320 \n\n• \nnumber of dedicated individuals from various agencies over the course of \nseveral years. \nTeam Members \nNow organized under the umbrella of Just Response, which \ncoordinates Missoula's MDTs addressing adult sexual violence, child abuse, \nand domestic violence, the MDT includes representatives from: \n• \t Missoula County Attorney's Office \n• \t Missoula Police Department \n• \t Missoula County Sheriffs Office \n•  Missoula County's Crime Victim Advocate program \n• \n\n• \t YWCA of Missoula \n• \t Student Assault Resource Center at the University of Montana \n• \t University ofMontana administration; \n.-~-----------------. \n• \t Mental health; \n• \t St. Patrick Hospital/First Step \n\nResource Center; \n\n• \t Youth Court; \n\\; .\"  'soula '$i~f'ilt~!,ar:' \n• \t Department of Child and  jttstiY!e.'system  .... \nanl/)'f:\\&'~:\"\"\"'i \nFamily Services.

The team also meets monthly for a confidential review of \nchallenging or problematic cases in order to improve the response in those \ncases and in future cases.  These meetings provide a forum for members to \nresolve occasional disagreements about how any particular case has been \nhandled by one or more ofthe members.  The team periodically engages in \ntrainings to further its work. \n• \n323 \n\n• \nThe Just Response Sexual Violence team members regularly engage \nin conversations to reach a shared understanding of their respective roles and \nresponsibilities in working with victims of sexual assault. Team members \nregularly bring to the surface, explore and understand the roles and \nlimitations that each member may have in responding to sexual assault in the \ncommunity. These discussions often focus on confidentiality and \ninformation sharing, as the goal of providing seamless and supportive \nservices to victims is always at the forefront of the discussion. \nUnderstanding the different roles, limitations, and obligations has \n• \nresulted in vast improvement in relationships between member agencies and \nhas significantly reduced the frustration and miscommunication that was \npreviously common. Team members now have accurate expectations of \nother members of the team and are able to better coordinate efforts on behalf \nof a victim. Team members are in frequent contact outside ofthe formal \nteam meetings, coordinating efforts on behalf of victims. The team has \nfound that this improved interagency communication improves the criminal \njustice response and minimizes the trauma for sexual assault victims when \nthey seek medical and legal help in the community. A recent review of cases \nfound that approximately 2/3 of sexual assault victims over the age of 16 \n• \n324 \n\n• \nwho seek medical care and assistance at the First Step clinic report their \nassaults to law enforcement. \nWhile prosecutors are responsible for evaluating, charging and trying \nthe case, they cannot succeed without the work and support ofhealth care \nproviders, law enforcement, medical professionals, state crime labs, \nadvocates, and other allied professionals.  The Missoula County Attorney's \nOffice has played an active role in the initial and continued development of \nthe team response to sexual assault in Missoula. \nIn addition to the formal team, informal communication between team \n• \n\nmembers is frequent. The Missoula County Attorney's Office and the \nMissoula Police Department Special Victims Unit investigators meet weekly \nto discuss cases. \n• \n325 \n\n• \nREFERENCES \nCHAPTER! \nCampbell, R.

Fox  Department of Justice \nAttorney General  215 North Sanders \nP.O. Box 201401 \nHelena, MT 59620-1401 \nAN INTRODUCTION FROM TIM FOX, \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF MONTANA \nOn June 10,2014, I signed a memorandum ofunderstanding (MOU) , with Missoula County, the \nMissoula County Attorney's Office (MCAO), and the United States Department ofJustice \n(USDOJ) resolving USDOJ's investigation of the MCAO's handling of sex assault prosecutions. \nThis MOU outlined a cooperative agreement between the Montana Attorney General's Office \n(MTAGO) and the MCAO to ensure the success ofthe MCAO's efforts to improve its response \nto sexual assault.  My office provided the first, semi-annual report to the USDOJ in December \n2014 and we published the first quarterly report in January 2015. The first quarterly report is \navailable here: hups:l/dojmt.govlwp-contentluploadsIQuarterly-Report-Januaf1!-2015.pd(. \nI am now pleased to present to the public our second quarterly report covering progress and \ncompliance with the agreements through March 2015.  I've assigned a member of our Sex Assault \nProsecution Unit to work with our technical advisor-nationally recognized sex assault expert \nAnne Munch-to work together to assist the MCAO and monitor compliance as described in the \nvarious MOUS. As part ofthis process, this team of experts spent a week in Missoula in early May \nworking with the MeAO to review ongoing cases and discuss advanced investigative and trial \nstrategy issues for these cases.  They observed one ofthe weekly SVU meetings where \nThis and the other MOUs are attached to the First Quarterly Repol1, available here at https:/ldojmt.gov!wp­\nI \nconlent!uploads!Ouarterlv-Report-Janualy-2015.pd(. \n3 \n\ninvestigators and prosecutors who specialize in sex assault cases meet to discuss ongoing cases. \nThey also met with an Attorney from the USDO]'s Civil Rights Division to review in person the \nUSDOJ's comments to a first draft ofthis report. \nBased on these and many other interactions, my staff reports that MeAO is sincerely dedicated \nand hard at work in ensuring they fulfill their obligations under these agreements and make \nimprovements to sex assault prosecutions in Missoula.  A few ofthe more notable \naccomplishments since the first quarterly report include: \n• \t The MeAO and my office have implemented a formalized monitoring and compliance \nplan to streamline and add transparency to the compliance and monitoring process for the \ninvolved parties and the public. \n• \t The MCAO now has an in-house victim witness coordinator to improve communication \nbetween the MCAO and sex assault victims. \n• \t The MCAO has added a fourth prosecutor to the SVU unit to help ensure individual \nworkloads in the SVU permit for proper attention to be given to sex assault cases. \n• \t The MCAO is requesting further investigation in a significantly greater proportion ofcases \nreferred from law enforcement-indicating increased diligence and communication \nbetween prosecution and law enforcement to ensure that all investigative avenues are \nthoroughly explored prior to a charging decision. \nWe also continue to take the resources developed from our work with the MeAO and provide \nthem to prosecutors all over Montana.  We have made available and distributed the Sex Assault \nPolicy and Procedures Manual to prosecutors allover Montana and the public at: \nhttns:lldojmt.govl\"'P-conlentl/m/oadsISEXUAL-ASSAULT-POLICY-AND-PROCEDURE-MANUAL.pd( \nFinally, my staff is working with Anne Munch to develop proposals to strengthen our sex assault \nlaws in Montana and for our Sex Assault Prosecution Unit to provide a series of sex assault \ntrainings for prosecutors all over Montana. \n4 \n\nAlthough great things are happening, our efforts are far from over.  As would be true in any \nprosecution office, we have identified opportunities for improvement in the way that the MCAO \nhandles sex assaults. \nI look forward to continuing cooperation with the MCAO and the USDOJ to address these \nopportunities and continue to make strides this extraordinary effort to make MCAO a model for \nthe prosecution ofthese critically important cases. \nTim Fox \n5 \n\nWORK CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THE MOU'S IN THE REPORTING \n\nPERIOD JANUARY 2015 - MARCH 2015 \n\nIn addition to continued monitoring ofcompliance with the agreements, our efforts in the \nlast quarter were focused on the implementation ofthe comments that Anne Munch (the \nTechnical Advisor) made in response to the first quarterly report.  The following is a summary of \nthe progress in the same order as those topics were recommended in The Technical Advisor's \nletter, Dated December 26, 2014.2 \nL  Development ofPolicies and Guidelines for Sexual Assault Cases: \nRecommendation:  The Technical advisor recommended that the Montana AG create an \nadditional condensed version of the specific policy and guideline language and use that \ndocument to develop compliance measures and processes. \nResponse:  Our office has created a Condensed Policy and Guidelines for Handling Sex Assault \nCases.  This document is attached as Exhibit I.  We worked cooperatively with the US DOJ and \nthe MCAO to develop and revise these policies. This document is intended to provide all parties \nto the MOU, and particularly the Sex Assault Prosecutors in the Missoula County Attorney's \nOffice, with a concise summary ofcritical policies applicable to sex assault cases pursuant to the \nvarious MOUs and the Sex Assault Policy and Procedures Manual. \nIL  Training for county attorney supervisors and prosecutors in response to sexual assault: \nRecommendation: The Technical Advisor recommended that all multi-disciplinary partners who \nare available to attend the training on Interviewing Sexual Assault Victims, including law \nenforcement, do so.  She also recommended that any Missoula County Sheriff's Deputy assigned \nto sex assault cases be trained to the same level as was required in the USDOJ agreement, which \nthe Missoula Police Department and the University of Montana had already received. \nResponse:  Several multi-disciplinary partners, including three Missoula County Sheriffs \n2 This lener is attached to the First Quarterly Report, available here al hltps:l/dojml.gov/wp­\ncontentlllploadsIQllarterly-Report-Janllarv-20 /5.pd[. \n6 \n\nDeputies from the Detectives division, one ofthe crime victim advocates, and all ofthe MCAO \nSVU attorneys attended a Webinar training that covered interviewing Sexual Assault victims. \nThe Webinar was a three part series that included training on Neurobiology of Sexual Assault, \nthe Neurobiology of Trawna, practical implications, and the Forensic Experiential Trawna \nInterview.  The training was presented by the National Center for the Victims of Crime in spring \n2014 and September 2014. \nIlL  Assurances as to on-going practices within the Missoula County Attorney's Office: \nRecommendation:  The Technical advisor recommended meetings between the new victim \nadvocate together with other members ofthe MCAO to discuss how the new MCAO victim \nadvocate will fit into existing service position structure and work proactively with outside \nadvocacy and law enforcement partners. \nResponse: The MCAO has filled the new Victim Witness Coordinator (VWC) position. Her \nname is Cathy Dorle.  The VWC currently participates with other victim advocacy organizations \nas member ofthe MCAO Special Victim's Unit (SVU).  She meets weekly with members ofthe \nMissoula County Crime Victim Advocate Office and SVU detectives from the Missoula City PD \nand Missoula County Sheriff's Office. \nThe VWC also participates in the monthly Missoula County Multidisciplinary Task Force \nmeetings (MDT), which includes law enforcement, prosecutors, medicallhealth care providers, \nvictim advocates and other social service professionals.  The MDT's purpose is a unified \napproach to addressing child abuse and sexual assault in Missoula County. \nThe VWC participates in another multidisciplinary monthly meeting at First Step, wherein cases \ninvolving sexual assault are reviewed and discussed. The members of this team include, among \nothers, law enforcement, the YWCA, and Child and Family Services. \nFinally, the VWC is working with the Missoula Crime Victim Advocates on an ongoing basis. \nThe VWC reports that the cooperation, communication and infonnation sharing between the \nVWC and the MCVA   has been proceeding smoothly.  While this position is only a few months \n7 \n\nold, the VWC's role at this point has been to assist the MCAO in fulfilling their duties of \ncommunication and consultation with the victims as well as informing the victims oftheir rights. \nAlong these lines, the MCAO has developed a document entitled, \"Victim Rights.\" This \ndocument is provided to and discussed with victims during the initial meetings between the \nvictim and the MCAO.  It is attached at Exhibit 4. \nIV. \t Improved communication and coordination with law enforcement and community \npartners: \nRecommendation: The Technical Advisor recommended a joint training be conducted on \"the \nrequirements ofsuccessful sexual assault prosecutions to facilitate effective investigations and \nminimize the influence of impermissible bias\" for the Missoula Police Department (MPD), the \nUniversity of Montana Police Department (fonnerly known as the University of Montana Office \nofPublic Safety), and the Missoula County Sheriff's Office (MeSO) detectives, public safety \nofficers or sheriffs deputies. \nResponse:  The MCAO has informed us that Officers with the University of Montana and the \nMissoula Police Department are current on this training.  In addition, the MCAO SVU attorneys \nconducted further training for the MCSO on this topic on April 28 and 29, 2015. \nV.  Assessment ofthis Agreement and Review ofCases by the Montana Attorney General: \nRecommendation: The Technical advisor recommended our office develop a fonnal plan for \nmonitoring compliance. \nResponse:  Our office worked with the MCAO and the USDOJ to develop a fonnal plan.  It is \ncomplete and was fonnally implemented in the MCAO earlier this Quarter.  The plan is attached \nas Exhibit 2. \n8 \n\nCOMPLIANCE UPDATES \n\nOn Friday, March 13, a representative from the MT AGO's Prosecution Services Bureau \n(PSB), met telephonically with Missoula COWlty Attorney Kirsten Pabst and Criminal Chief \nJason Marks.  Two weeks prior to this meeting, the MCAO had provided the MT AGO with the \ndata described in the Monitoring and Compliance Plan, including a list oftraining and the \nupdated Sexual Assault Case Data Forms.  Having reviewed these materials, the MT AGO and \nMCAO discussed the reporting points outlined in the Monitoring and Compliance plan.  The MT \nAGO followed up with specific queries on several particular cases. \nFinally, a representative from MT AGO PSB made an in person visit to the MCAO during the \nfirst week ofMay, 2015 along with Anne Munch to discuss cases and policy with the MCAO. \nDuring that time the parties also met with a representative from the USDOJ Civil Rights \nDivision to discuss USDOI's comments to a first draft ofthis report.  The parties also \nparticipated in one ofthe weekly SVU meeting where the SVU prosecutors and investigators \ndiscuss ongoing sex assault investigations. \nDuring all these interactions the MCAO was professional, prompt and forthcoming in \nassisting the MT AGO in gathering the data and answering questions.  The MCAO suggested \nsome proposed changes to the Condensed Policies and Guidelines.  The following is a summary \nof the updates provided by the MCAO to the MT AGO in order ofthe subject topics provided in \nthe Monitoring and Compliance Plan. \nI.  Changes, ifany, to policies and guidelines for handling sexual assault cases: \nAs explained above, the MT AGO, MCAO and US DOJ have developed a formalized \nMonitoring and Compliance Plan as well as a Condensed Policy Guidelines for Handling Sex \nAssault cases. Pursuant to this plan the MCAO has developed a Case Data sheet to be included \nand updated in each case file and a Victim's Rights Form to guide discussion during meetings \nwith the victim(s).  These documents are attached at Exhibits 3and 4 respectively. \n9 \n\nlL \t A list and description and copies ofany materials for Sexual Assault related trainings \nconducted or attended by MCAO attorneys and supervisors, including victim advocates, \nthe MPD or MSO since the last Quanerly Repon: \n* \n• \t Prosecuting Sexual Violence, NDAA.

MCAO Criminal Chief \nJason Marks was a member ofthe committee tasked with developing this Audit. \nVIII.  Status update on the Special Victims Unit process at the MPD: \n• \t The SVU attorneys meet weekly with the MPD SVU detectives and the victim \nadvocate assigned to the MPD SVU.  The MCAO victim witness coordinator also \nattends the weekly meetings.  The parties discuss cases that have been referred to \n11 \n\nthe MCAO as well as cases that are under investigation.  There have also been \ninstances where the parties have discussed strategies for engaging reluctant \nvictims who the advocate is aware ofbut who are reluctant to make a report. The \nMCSO will be included in these meetings once they have a dedicated investigator. \nIX \t Status update on MCAO involvement with law enforcement and community partners \nand update on community education efforts: \n• \t MCAO prosecutors have scheduled several outreach opportunities in the community for \nthis quarter including presentations for Leadership Missoula, Frenchtown High School \n(Healthy Choices), and the Montana Victim Advocate Academy.  The County Attorney \nwill also participate as a guest speaker at Kiwanis and will spend an hour talking about \nthe MCAO's agreement with the MTAG and USDOJ aimed at improving the prosecution \nof sexual assaults. \nX  Status ofthe $10,000 Expert Witnessfeesfund: \nThe fund has been used to pay the following experts in sexual assault cases tried this past \nQuarter: \n• \t Jean McAllister, MSW:  Jean testified as a blind expert to the nature and dynamics of \ntrauma. She explained the counterintuitive behaviors exhibited by victims oftrauma and \ndiscussed the symptoms that may arise after a traumatic event.  She discussed the \ndynamics of sexual assault specifically, and the differences that are seen with non­\nstranger assaults. \n• \t Cat Otway, RN, SANE-A:  Cat is a registered nurse and a SANE-A.  She discussed the \ninjuries to the victim and how they are consistent with the report the victim made for \nsexual assault.  Cat also dispels some myths of sexual assault and explains that there are \nnot always physical injuries associated with a sexual assault. \nXI. \t Review ofall MCAOfile~'for all declined sexual assault cases ~·jnce the prior Quarterly \nreport, ifany: \n12 \n\n• \t There were no sexual assault cases referred to MCAO for charging that were declined for \nprosecution since the prior Quarterly report. \nAGGREGATE DATA ANALYSIS \nThe MOU between the MT AGO and MCA03 contemplates that the MT AGO will provide \nin this quarterly report \"an analysis ofcollected data from the MCAO and a report on all \nmeasurable improvements in the response to allegations ofsex assault.\"  For purposes ofthis \nreport, the Data analyzed will include those items listed on page 3 of the MOU between the \nMCAO, MT AGO and USDOJ, which includes the Aggregate Data on Sex Assault cases from \nJune 2014 through March 1,2015, specifically including: \n• \t The number ofsexual assault cases referred for review by 10ca1law enforcement to \nMCAO; \n• \t The number ofsexual assault cases charged by MCAO; \n• \t The disposition ofcharged sexual assault cases; \n• \t The number ofsexual assault cases in which additional investigation was requested of \nlocal law enforcement; \n• \t The number of victims of sexual assault who have utilized the services of the in-house \nvictim witness-coordinator. \nAs a pre-requisite to gathering this Aggregate Data and as a way to monitor compliance in \nparticular cases, the MCAO also is providing the MT AGO with the following case specific data \nas outlined in the Monitoring and Compliance Plan (Exhibit 2): \n• \t Copies ofall Current Sex Assault Case Data Forms on all cases referred to MCAO for \ncharging or review since the last Quarterly Report. \n• \t Copy ofthe complete files for all declined sex assault cases, ifany, since prior Quarterly \nreport. \n• \t Data on sexual assault cases, organized by Defendant name and Case Number, which \nincludes: \n• \t Referral type: review or charging. \n• \t Decision made \n• \t Disposition \n• \t Sentence \nJ All the MOUs referenced in this report are attached as Exhibit to the First Quarterly Report, available here at \nhltpS:lldojml.govlwp-conlentlup{oadsIOuarter{v-Reporl-Januarv-20 J5.pd(. \n13 \n\n• \t The following dates and time spans: Date ofreferral, Date ofany request for \nfurther investigation; Date ofprosecution decision; Date ofmeeting with victim; \nDate ofmeeting with advocate; Date ofplea offer; Date ofDisposition. \nThe Aggregate Data provided by the MCAO is presented in attached Exhibits 5 and 6. \nExhibit 5 represents cases referred for a charging decision from June 2014 through March I, \n2015.  Cases referred for a charging decision are cases where law enforcement feels it has \ncompleted investigation and that there is probable cause to charge the case. \nExhibit 6 represents cases referred from June 2014 through March 1,2015 for \"review \nonly.\"  Cases referred for \"review\" are cases \"where, in the eyes ofthe MPD detective, the \ninvestigation has not developed probable cause necessary for arrest and prosecution.,,4.  The \nassigned prosecutor reviews that investigation and either agrees with the law enforcement \ndecision to make the case inactive or refers the case back for further investigation. \nL  Comparative Analysis ofCases Referred for Charging Decisions: \nAn analysis ofthe aggregate data for cases referred for a charging decision is provided \nbelow in Table 1.  Table I is based on data compiled in November 2014 for the first quarterly \nreport.  Data gathered since the first quarterly report through March 1, 2015 indicates that no \ncases were referred for charging in the current reporting period ending March I, 2015.  There is \nno clear explanation for the fact that no cases were referred for charging in this quarter.  It \nappears that this may simply be due to a lull in referrals due to the natural ebb and flow ofcrime, \nthe fact that sexual assault investigations take time, and/or the fact that the MCAO is referring \nmany cases back for further investigation. \nThe absence ofcases referred in this reporting period provides no opportunity for any \ncomparison to last quarter's cases referred for charging.  However, in the interest offurther \ndeveloping the baseline for future comparison, this report will briefly address two important \nmetrics: (I) the time between when a case is referred for charging and the MCAO makes first \ncontact with the victim; and (2) the time between when a case is referred for charging and the \nMCAO makes a charging decision. \n4 Memorandum ofUnderstanding Between Office of the Missoula County Attorney's Office and the City of \nMissoula Police Department (Dec. 13, 2013), at p.2. \n14 \n\nAccording to the MCAO Sex Assault Manual there is no specific deadline for making a \ncharging decision on cases referred for prosecution or meeting with the victim.  The manual \nstates at pages 19 to 20 that the prosecution should make contact with the investigator within two \nweeks ofreferral and emphasizes that communications with victims is of paramount importance. \nIn 80% ofthe cases referred for charging, the MCAO made a charging decision within I \nweek ofreferral.  The remaining 20% consists oftwo cases that took 129 days and 70 days \nrespectively.  The MCAO explained these longer delays were explained as due to heavy \nworkload.  With respect to contacting victims, the MCAO made (or attempted to make) contact \nwith victims in 70% of the cases within 30 days of the case being referred for prosecution.  In the \nremaining 30% ofcases, the MCAO took 44 days, 73 days, and 147 days respectively to contact \nthe victims.  The 147 day delay in contacting the victim was for a legitimate reason, which for \nprivacy reasons, is not disclosed here.  The MCAO stated that the 44 and 73 day delays were due \nto heavy workload. \nWhile the longer delays in both charging and victim contact appear to be a in the minority \nof cases, the MCAO acknowledges that this metric needs to be improved.  To address these \ndelays the MCAO has added a fourth prosecutor to the SVU unit and requires SVU attorneys to \nobtain supervisor permission to extend any deadlines for charging or victim contact. \nAdditionally, one ofthe primary duties ofthe in-house victim witness coordinator will be to \nensure victim contact occurs as soon as possible after the case is referred. \nTable 1:  Analysis of Sex Assault Cases Referred for a Charging Decision \n\nBetween June 2014 and November 25, 2014 (Exhibit 5). \n\nSA Cases Referred to MCAO for Charging by MPD and  10 \nMCSO \nSA Cases Charged by MCAO  8 \nSA Cases Referred for Further Investigation by MCAO  I \nSA Cases Declined by MCAO  I \nSA Cases in Which Prosecutor Made Contact with  8' \n,: Regarding the two cases in which the victim was not contacted. one victim was unable t.o be reached despite \nattempts by the Detective and Crime Victim Advocate.

Table 2 includes data compiled in November 2014 for the first quarterly \nreport.  Table 3 includes all data gathered since the first quarterly report through March 1,2015. \nThe Sex Assault Policy and Procedure Manual, at page 19 through 21, provides that cases \nreferred to MCAO for \"review only\" should be reviewed by a prosecutor within one month of \nreferral.  Only 6 out ofthe 16 (or 38%) ofcases referred for review in the quarter ending \nNovember 2014 were reviewed with 30 days.  In the current reporting quarter 6 out of the 9 \ncases (or 67%) ofcases where the review is complete were completed within the 30 day \nwindow.6  This appears to be a substantial improvement. \nFurthennore, the average time period for review ofthese types of cases has decreased \nfrom 40 days for a review for the first quarterly reporting period down to 16 days during this \ncurrent reporting period.  Finally, there was comparative increase in this reporting period for the \nrelative number ofcases referred back for further investigation. We see this as evidence that the \nMCAO is taking a more affirmative role in ensuring investigations are exhaustive and complete \nfrom the prosecution perspective, before a case is closed. \nreport. \n• At the time ofthe March I, 2015 data, review was still pending in 4 cases and it is possible that subsequent data \nwill show that that review will have been completed in less than 30 days or more than 30 days. \n16 \n\nTable 2:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for \"Review Only\" \n(Exhibit 6--June 2014 throu2h November 25. 2014) \nAverage Time  Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred  Which the \nReferral and  Investigator  Back for  CA's \nDecision  Further  Review is \n(Days)  Investigation  Pending \nTotal SA Cases  16  40  12  4  0 \nReferred for \nReview \nSA Cases  9  41  7  2  1 \nReferred for No \nPC \nSA Cases  8  40  5  3'  0 \nReferred Where \nVictim Declined \nto Participate \nTable 3:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for \"Review Only\" \n(Exhibit 6-November 26, 2014 throu2h March 1,2015) \nAverage Time  Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CAReferred  Which the \nReferral and  Investigator  Back for  CA's \nDecision  Further  Review is \n(Days)  investigation  Pending \nTotal SA Cases  13  16  2  7  4 \nReferred for \nReview \nSA Cases  5  19  I  2  2 \nReferred for No \nPC \n7 The reasons for referring a case back for further investigations are varied.

Specifically, this Quarter it is clear that the \ncommunication between the MCAO and law enforcement on these cases has improved, as \nevidenced in part by the weekly SVU meetings and the significant increase in cases referred for \nmore investigation.  We do see an opportunity for improvement for quicker decision making and \nvictim contact on cases referred for charging.  Based on the additional SVU prosecutor and \ncloser supervisor control over deadlines, we expect that we will see fewer delays in future data. \n8 The reasons for referring a case back for further investigations are varied.  In one case the CA made contact with \nthe victim and the victim decided to participate. Even where the victim has declined to participate. the CA will \nsometimes want to insure the timely collection ofephemeral evidence in case the victim decides to later participate. \n18 ",

This Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") is entered into by the Missoula County Attorney's \nOffice (lithe MCAO\"), Missoula County (\"Missoula County\" or \"County\"), the Montana Attorney \nGeneral's Office (\"Montana Attorney General\"), and the United States Department of Justice \n(\"United States\" or \"USDOJ\") (collectively, lithe Parties\"). This MOU is intended to resolve \nUSDOJ's investigation of the MCAO, initiated pursuant to 42 U.s.c. § 14141 and the Omnibus \nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 U.S.c. § 3789d. \nB.  The purpose of this MOU is to provide for a cooperative effort by the parties, to ensure that the \nMCAO responds to sexual assault in a nondiscriminatory manner that complies with the \nConstitutions and laws of Montana and the United States; improves the safety and security of \nvictims of sexual assault in Missoula County; and increases the Missoula County community's \nconfidence in the MCAO's response to sexual assault.  Entry of this MOU is in the public interest \nsince it provides for expeditious changes to improve public safety and adherence to state and \nfederal law. \nC.  The United States investigated claims of gender discrimination by the MCAO in its handling of \nreports of sexual assault, and on February 14, 2014, provided a letter to the MCAO regarding \nthat investigation.  The MCAO enters into this MOU expressly denying any claims of \nconstitutional or statutory violations. \nD.  The United States asserts that it has jurisdiction both to investigate and to bring suit against the \nMCAO pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 14141 and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n1968,42 U.S.c. § 3789d.  The MCAO, the County, and the Montana Attorney General expressly \ndeny that the USDOJ has any authority over locally elected county attorneys who fall under the \nstatutory supervisory control of the Montana Attorney General pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. \nSection 2-15-501(5). Nothing in this MOU constitutes any admission, concession, or agreement \nby the MCAO, the County, or the Montana Attorney General that the United States has such \njurisdiction or authority to investigate or seek remedy against the MCAO regarding its handling \nof sexual assault cases, nor a concession by the United States that it does not have such \njurisdiction or authority. \nE.

The Montana Attorney General has begun to implement a state-wide training program and is \ndeveloping a state-wide policy guidance with respect to the handling of sexual assault cases by \ncounty attorneys, law enforcement, victim advocates, and the state and local court systems.  In \nsupport of these initiatives and in support of the MCAO's efforts, subject to the limitations in \nparagraph F, above, the Montana Attorney General will utilize the services and work product of \na Technical Advisor as provided for in Exhibit 1 to this MOU. \nI.  The Parties acknowledge that this MOU is intended to ensure the success of MCAO's efforts to \nimprove its response to sexual assault.  Nothing in this MOU will be construed as an \nacknowledgement, an admission, or evidence of liability of Missoula County or the MCAO for \nany violation of state or federal law, violation of the State or Federal Constitution, or for any \nalleged gender bias or discrimination in the performance of sexual assault prosecution duties. \nJ.

(202) 514-4883 \nPage 8 of S \n\nEXHIBIT 1 \nAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MONTANA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND \nTHE MISSOULA COUNTY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE \nThe Montana Attorney General and the Missoula County Attorney's Office (MCAO) enter into this \nAgreement because the Montana Attorney General and MCAO are committed to ensuring that \nallegations of sexual assault are handled appropriately, that victims are treated with compassion and \nrespect, and that the criminal justice system operates without gender bias. \nPurpose. The purpose of this Agreement is to promote public confidence in the criminal justice system \nthrough agreement and cooperation between the MCAO and the Montana Attorney General by \nimproving policies and practices related to sexual assault prosecutions in Missoula County.  For purposes \nof this Agreement, the term \"sexual assault\" means sexual contact without consent as defined in Mont. \nCode Ann. Sections 45-5-502,503, exclusive of sexual assault cases involving victims under the age of \n16. \nAuthority. Pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. Section 2-15-501(5), the Attorney General of the State of \nMontana has the sole authority to supervise the MCAO in the handling of any specific case.  Only the \nMontana Attorney General shall have the authority to provide input on the MCAO's  decision to exercise \nits prosecutorial discretion with respect to any individual case, specifically whether to charge a case that \nhas been declined; investigate or direct further investigation of a referred sexual assault case; or take, or \nrefrain from taking, any actions related to the prosecution of charged cases. \nTechnical Advisor. The Montana Attorney General agrees to enter into contract with Anne Munch \nConsulting, Inc. (hereafter the \"Technical Advisor\") for a total amount including fees, costs and expenses \nnot to exceed $150,000. The Technical Advisor shall assist with training attorneys in the Montana \nDepartment of Justice Prosecution Services Bureau and the MCAO's supervisors to standards acceptable \nto the Montana Attorney General regarding the proper handling of sexual assault cases, and to assist the \nMontana Attorney General with the assessment of the MCAO's performance under this Agreement. \nThe Technical Advisor will only have the contractual duties and responsibilities conferred by the \nMontana Attorney General as may be needed to facilitate the MCAO's performance under this \nAgreement. The maximum amount of compensation, including costs and expenses, payable to the \nTechnical Advisor will be specified in the contract with the Technical Advisor and shall not exceed that \namount. \nThe Technical Advisor shall not have any authority with respect to the MCAO's prosecutorial discretion; \nspecifically she shall not have the authority to direct the MCAO to charge a case that has been declined; \ninvestigate or direct further investigation of a referred sexual assault case; take or refrain from taking, \nany actions related to the prosecution of charged cases; or related to proposing or accepting plea \nagreements. \nThe Technical Advisor will be hired for a period of not less than one year, but may have her contract \nextended at the Montana Attorney General's sole discretion. The MCAO has agreed to seek funding for \nthe fees and costs of the Technical Advisor from the Missoula County Board of Commissioners for a \nmaximum period of two years from the date this Agreement is executed by the Montana Attorney \nPage 1 of 7 \n\nGeneral.  The Montana Attorney General will work with the Technical Advisor to reach a mutually \nagreed upon fees and costs arrangement based on a contract amount that will not be exceeded. \nDevelopment of policies and guidelines for sexual assault cases.  Within 90 days of execution of the \ncontract with the Technical Advisor, the MCAD agrees to develop written policies and guidelines for \nhandling of sexual assault cases.  The MCAD agrees these policies and guidelines will be consistent \nwhere appropriate, with guidance ofthe National District Attorneys Association (NOAA) regarding sexual \nassault prosecutions and will include the following standard topics relevant to sexual assault \nprosecutions:  plea guidelines, internal timelines for handling sexual assault cases, including charging \ndecisions, coordination with law enforcement and community partners, communication with victim \nadvocates and complaining witnesses, response to stranger and non-stranger sexual assault, response to \ndrug- or alcohol-facilitated sexual assault, and supervisory review of case handling and charging \ndecisions. The Montana Attorney General, in consultation with the Technical Advisor, shall have sole \nauthority and discretion to review and approve the MCAD's written policies and guidelines. Following \ntheir approval by the Montana Attorney General, the MCAD's written policies and guidelines shall be \npublished on the MCAD's website. \nTraining for county attorney supervisors and prosecutors in response to sexual assault.  Within the \nfirst year of the agreement and every year thereafter for the life of this Agreement, the MCAD agrees to \nprovide prosecutors, supervisors and the in-house victim advocate initial and on-going training in \nhandling sexual assault cases to ensure they are fully equipped to handle these matters. The training \nwill be consistent with the guidelines of the NOAA and will be approved by the Montana Attorney \nGeneral in consultaNon with the Technical Advisor. The training will include, but is not limited to: \nmethods of proving non-stranger, drug- or alcohol-facilitated sexual assault, sexual assault where \nconsent is a defense, the body of scientific knowledge commonly accepted as necessary for prosecuting \nsexual assault cases, effective techniques for interviewing sexual assault victims, and addressing \nmisinformation about bias and sexual assault victimology, including misinformation about victim \nresponse to sexual assault. The MCAD agrees, at its own expense, to ensure that deputy county \nattorneys handling sexual assault cases participate in any sexual assault prosecution training offered by \nthe Montana Attorney General. \nAssurances as to on-going practices within the Missoula County Attorney's Office. The MCAD agrees \nto implement or continue the following on-going practices with respect to its response to sexual assault \nallegations, which the Attorney General shall have sale authority and discretion to review and approve \nin consultation with the Technical Advisor: \n•  In-person meetings with complaining witnesses:  Prosecutors will make every reasonable \neffort to conduct in-person meetings with the detectives and complaining witnesses prior to \nmaking a determination whether to file charges in sexual assault cases referred and \nrecommended for prosecution. Consistent with Montana law, advocates will be invited and \nencouraged to participate in such meetings between prosecutors and complaining \nwitnesses. \n•  Case related communication with victims and victim advocates:  Subject to the cooperation \nand availability of victims, prosecutors will communicate key substantive information and \ndecisions about cases and the underlying rationale directly to victims or their victim \nadvocates as required by Montana law. \nPage 2 of 7 \n\n•  Victim Advocates:  The MCAO agrees to seek funding from the Missoula County Board of \nCommissioners for a full-time in-house victim-coordinator for the MCAO, in order to provide \nimproved notification, support, and referral services to victims and to provide victims with \ninformation not available to the Missoula Crime Victim Advocate Office or external \nadvocates. \n•  Utilization of specialized sexual assault prosecution expertise:  Within 60 days of the \nexecution of this Agreement, the MCAO agrees to designate an appropriate number of \nattorneys, based on caseload, to be primarily responsible for sexual assault cases.  The \nattorneys will be selected based on their demonstrated skills and interest and will be \nrequired to attend periodic sexual assault-specific training. Nothing in this Agreement \nprohibits the MCAO from pairing less-experienced county attorneys with county attorneys \nwho specialize in sexual assault cases to develop skills, provided the deputy county attorney \nwho specializes in sexual assault cases has primary responsibilities in the prosecution.  In. \naddition, the MCAO will utilize the services of specialized prosecution expertise within the \nMontana Department of Justice Prosecution Services Bureau whenever the necessary \nexpertise for a particular sexual assault prosecution is not available within the MCAO or, \nbecause of caseload demands, is unreasonably delayed. \n•  Utilization of specialized sexual assault investigation expertise: The parties acknowledge the \nMCAO does not employ internal investigators, but rather relies upon the investigatory \nexpertise of cooperating law enforcement agencies.  However, in evaluating cases and \npreparing prosecutions for trial, the MCAO does review and evaluate investigations and may \nrequest further investigatory effo~ts when necessary to making a charging decision or in \npreparing a case for trial. The MCAO will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding \n(MOU) with local law enforcement agencies to formalize past practices and ensure that \nappropriate and adequate investigative services are available to prosecutors for the \nhandling of sexual assault cases from referral through trial. The MOU will include the \nprovision that i( after case referral to the MCAO, further investigation is necessary, the \nMCAO will request further investigation from law enforcement or the Montana Department \nof Justice Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI).  The MCAO agrees to utilize the services of \nspeCialized investigative expertise within the DCI whenever the necessary expertise for a \nparticular sexual assault investigation is not available within local law enforcement offices. \nIn addition, such expertise shall berequested whenever a conflict of interest would prevent \nan objective investigation or caseload demands on local law enforcement would \nunreasonably delay an investigation.  .: \nNothing herein shall be construed to, or is intended to infer, that the MCAO has supervisory \nauthority over, or control of, the investigatory functions of law enforcement. \n•  Computer Tracking System:  Unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties, the \nMCAO will, within 120 days of the date of this Agreement and at MCAO's cost, design and \nimplement a computer tracking system for victim advocates and victims to track the status \nof their cases.  Subject to privacy limitations imposed by state and federal laws, the \ninformation in this tracking system will be accessible by in-house and external victim \nadvocates. \nPage 3 of 7 \n\n•  Supervisor Review:  The MCAO agrees to continue enhanced supervision of prosecuting \nattorneys responsible for prosecuting sexual assault cases. \nSupervisors will closely evaluate sexual assault investigations and prosecutions and ensure \nthat such prosecutions are not undermined by lack of knowledge or impermissible bias and \nare conducted with the same level of attention and quality as prosecutions of other crimes. \nSupervisors will review and approve decisions to decline prosecutions in sexual assault \ncases. This review will include an evaluation to assess whether the declination decision was \nmade for any inappropriate reason.  Supervisors will document their review. \nThe MCAO will conduct a periodic examination of supervisory review data in all sexual \nassault cases, including closed cases, declined cases and cases where the complaining \nwitness declined to participate in the prosecution of such cases in an effort to identify any \nsystemic problems, including deficiencies or delays in the investigation, charging deciSion, \nand prosecution of sexual assault cases, and indications, if any, of gender bias.  The review \nwill include information gathered from a review of case files and feedback from victims and \nvictim advocates. \nImproved communication and coordination with law enforcement and community partners. The \nMCAO agrees to implement measures to improve communication and coordination to effectively handle \nsexual assault cases.  The Montana Attorney General, in consultation with the Technical Advisor, shall \nhave sole authority and discretion to approve such measures, which will include: \n•  Cooperation with law enforcement and community partners: The MCAO agrees to increase \nand improve its communication, coordination and cooperation with community and law \nenforcement partners, including the Missoula Police Department (MPD), Missoula County \nSheriff's Office (MCSO), University of Montana Police Department (UMPD), Crime Victim \nAdvocate Office, and community advocates, including, without limitation, the Missoula \nYWCA, JUST Response, and the University of Montana SARC program. These efforts will be \naimed at increasing the willingness and ability of sexual assault victims to participate in \nprosecutions of meritorious cases, facilitating the collection and analysis of relevant \nevidence, and minimizing the additional hardship that this participation can cause for sexual \nassault victims. These efforts will include: \n•  Adherence to all agreed responsibilities set out in the Memorandum of Understanding \nbetween the MCAO and the MPD dated December 13, 2013 (a copy of which is attached \nhereto as Exhibit ((A\") and which shall also be applicable to any cases submitted to the \nMCAO by MCSO or UMPD.  Exhibit A will be amended to 1) ensure that supervisors in \nthe MCAO assess the quality of sexual assault investigations, provide written feedback \nto the Missoula Police; and 2) provide more guidance about the responsibilities of the \nMCAO for cases referred for review. \n•  Entering into an MOU with the MCSO with substantially the same terms as the MOU \nwith the MPD. \nPage 4 of 7 \n\n•  Working with stakeholders to clarify, in writing, the roles and responsibilities of the \nMCAO, crime victim advocates and community advocates related to supporting and \ncommunicating with victims of sexual assault. \n•  Agreeing to participate in and support the City of Missoula's efforts to organize and lead \na sexual assault safety and accountability audit. \n•  The MCAO agrees to provide training to the MPD and the MCSO detectives on the \nrequirements of successful sexual assault prosecutions to facilitate effective investigations \nand minimize the influence of impermissible bias. \n•  Public education and outreach:  In the interest of transparency and improved communication \nwith its community and law enforcement partners, the MCAO agrees to provide the public with \ninformation about the criminal justice process, including basic information about the roles of \nprosecutors and law enforcement in responding to sexual assault, the types of charges available \nin cases of sexual assault, and the policies applicable to plea negotiation. Such information will \nbe disseminated in a manner designed to reach the greatest number of victims of sexual assault \nand the law enforcement and community partners that interact with the victims of sexual \nassault in Missoula County, including through publication on the MCAO's website. This outreach \nwill include outreach focused on communities at particular risk of perpetrating or being \nvictimized by sexual assault. In collaboration with law enforcement and community partners, \nthe Montana Attorney General and the MCAO agree also to conduct outreach to communities at \nparticular risk for perpetrating or being victimized by sexual assault. The community outreach \nefforts will be funded at a level approved by, and paid by, the Montana Attorney General's \nOffice. \n•  Data collection: To identify shortcomings and assess improvement, the MCAO agrees to \ncollect specific information about decisions related to sexual assault referrals, initial \nmeetings with victims, charging decisions, plea offers, case dispositions, and sentences, \nincluding, but not limited to, the dates and periods oftime between each of these steps in \nthe MCAO's handling of a sexual assault case.  Except as to confidential criminal justice \ninformation, the MCAO agrees to collect and disseminate on a quarterly basis aggregate \ndata on sexual assault cases to the Montana Attorney General and the public. \n•  Victim and advocate survey: The MCAO agrees to participate in the victim survey program \ncurrently underway through the University of Montana to obtain feedback from victims and \nadvocates to help the MCAO continue to improve its handling of sexual assault cases.  The \nMCAO will work cooperatively with the Missoula Police Department and the University of \nMontana to ensure that the sexual assault victim survey includes questions about the \nexperience of sexual assault victims with the MCAO, including those victims who decline to \nparticipate in an investigation. The MCAO will seek to include questions asking whether and \nwhen victims meet with prosecutors; whether and how prosecutors prepare victims for \nproceedings related to the prosecution of their cases, including motions hearings, trials, and \nsentencing; whether and how prosecutors describe the prosecution process to victims; and \nwhether and how prosecutors inform victims about their rights during the investigative or \npretrial phases, during trial, and after trial and sentencing. \nPage 5 of 7 \n\nExpert Witness Expenses.  In order to facilitate and support prosecution of sexual assault cases, the \nMCAO will seek additional funding from the Missoula County Board of Commissioners in the amount of \n$10,000 a year for the next two fiscal years for the purpose of paying expert witnesses who may be \nneeded to provide additional evidence in such cases.  In addition, the Montana Attorney General will \nseek funding from the Montana Legislature to assist county attorneys for' such purpose in the next \nsession of the legislature. This funding is in addition to other sources of funding for experts and is not a \nlimit on the ability of the MCAO to hire such experts as are necessary to pursue cases. \nAssessment of this Agreement and Review of Cases by the Montana Attorney General. The Montana \nAttorney General, in consultation with the Technical Advisor, agrees to establish an appropriate plan to \nmonitor compliance with the terms of this Agreement. \n•  Monitoring: The monitoring duties of the Montana Attorney General will include:  the \ndevelopment and implementation of policies and training, and assessing implementation of \nother provisions of this Agreement, including, for example, the duty to evaluate supervision \nof sexual assault cases, coordination with law enforcement partners, and data collection. \nThe Montana Attorney General will also provide technical assistance to the MCAO, as \nappropriate pursuant to the Agreement.  Unless extended by agreement of the parties, an \nappropriate monitoring and compliance plan will be developed within 60 days of entering \ninto a contract with the Technical Advisor.  Following development of the monitoring and \ncompliance plan, in consultation with the Technical Advisor, the Montana Attorney General \nwill monitor compliance with this Agreement for a period of one (1) year. \n•  Reviewof Cases:  For a period of one (1) year following execution of this Agreement by the \nMontana Attorney General, the Montana Attorney General will review all sexual assault \ncases where the MCAO has declined prosecution. \nReporting. The Montana Attorney General, in consultation with the Technical Advisor, will provide \npublic quarterly reports regarding whether the requirements of this Agreement have been \nimplemented, including an analysis of collected data from the MCAO and a report on all measurable \nimprovements in the response to allegations of sexual assault.

Under this first-of-its-kind\n agreement, MCAO and the county agree to take a number of significant steps to improve MCAO’s\n response to allegations of sexual assault and eliminate discrimination and gender bias.  This agreement\n completes the Civil Rights Division’s investigation of the response by the Missoula criminal justice\n system and the University of Montana to sexual assault.    \n  \n \"This historic agreement will fundamentally transform the way in which the Missoula County\n Attorney's Office responds to sexual assault allegations,\" said Attorney General Eric Holder.  \"By taking\n key steps and implementing robust new safeguards to eliminate gender bias, improve communication\n and prosecution techniques, and increase support for victims, county law enforcement officials will\n strengthen their ability to combat sexual assault crimes, increase public safety, and protect those who\n are victimized.  This action marks a critical step forward in the Justice Department's comprehensive\n efforts to ensure the safety and civil rights of all people across the country.  And it is my hope that these\n remedies can serve as a model for the resolution of other cases moving forward.\"\n  \n Under the agreement, the MCAO will take the following steps, which will address gender bias in\n MCAO’s response to sexual assault and help to restore community confidence in the criminal justice\n system: Report a Crime\n  \n·          Develop and implement sexual assault policies and training for prosecutors, including Get a Job\n supervisors;\nLocate a Prison, Inmate, or Sex Offender\n·          Improve treatment of individuals who report sexual assault, including in-person interviews\n and improved communication; Apply for a Grant\n·          Use prosecution techniques that have been shown to result in better sexual assault\nSubmit a Complaint\n investigations, through improved communication with law enforcement and victims, use of\n investigators, closer supervision of the development of cases, hiring an in-house victim Report Waste, Fraud, Abuse or\n coordinator, and the use of expert witnesses;  Misconduct to the Inspector General\n·          Improve communication and coordination with other Missoula stakeholders regarding\n sexual assault response, including through public outreach and collaboration with the Find Sales of Seized Property\n Missoula Police Department in conducting, and analyzing the results of, a victim witness\nFind Help and Information for Crime\n survey; and  Victims\n·          Improve the tracking and sharing of data regarding sexual assault prosecutions, so that\n MCAO has a broader picture of what it is doing and can better identify any general concerns or Register, Apply for Permits, or Request\n necessary improvements.  Records\n  \nIdentify Our Most Wanted Fugitives\n Missoula Attorney General Tim Fox, who has oversight authority over all Montana County\n Attorneys, has agreed to monitor the implementation of these measures, review sexual assault cases Find a Form\n MCAO declines to prosecute, and retain a technical advisor, Anne Munch.  Munch is a former sex\nReport and Identify Missing Persons\n crimes prosecutor and one of the country’s foremost experts in the subject area. As technical advisor,\n Munch will provide training to MCAO, advise the Montana Attorney General regarding policies, and Contact Us\n make recommendations and provide reports regarding implementation that will be made publicly\n available, alongside the quarterly reports the Attorney General’s office will also publicly disseminate.\nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/June/14-crt-618.html[6/10/2014 6:32:57 PM]\n\nUSDOJ: Department of Justice Reaches Landmark Agreement to Improve Missoula County Attorney’s Office’s Response to Reports of Sexual Assault\n  \n “Sexual assault is a crime that is all too pervasive and that has devastating consequences,” said Acting\n Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Jocelyn Samuels.  “Today’s agreement completes a plan for\n comprehensive reform at every stage of the law enforcement response, from the handling of\n complaints of assault by the University of Montana, through the investigation of crimes by the\n Missoula Police Department, to the prosecution of those crimes by the County Attorney.   This holistic\n approach will enable the Missoula community to improve women’s safety and ensure respect for their\n civil rights.”\n  \n “Over the past year, the City of Missoula, the University of Montana, and the Missoula Police\n Department already have made important strides toward improving their response to sexual assault\n and strengthening the community’s confidence in its local police,” said Michael Cotter, United States\n Attorney for Montana.  “We are delighted that the Missoula County Attorney has agreed to partner\n with them and to work cooperatively with the Justice Department to improve the safety of women in\n Missoula.”\n  \n Today’s agreement resolves the last outstanding component of the department’s multi-pronged\n investigation, launched in May of 2012, regarding the handling of sexual assault complaints made by\n women in Missoula.  The investigation, conducted under the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement act\n of 1994, the Safe Streets Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education\n Amendments of 1972, evaluated the response to sexual assault at the University of Montana at\n Missoula, the University’s Office of Public Safety (OPS), the Missoula Police Department (MPD) and\n MCAO.  In May of 2013, the department entered into agreements with the university, OPS and MPD to\n resolve findings related to those parties and address deficiencies in their response to sexual assaults. \n The implementation of those agreements has already improved these parties’ response to sexual\n assaults.\n  \n As part of today’s agreement, Missoula’s County Attorney will dismiss with prejudice the declaratory\n judgment action filed on behalf of the county attorney against the department in February of 2014. \n The department has agreed not to file suit regarding its allegations, outlined in a February 2014 letter\n of findings, that the MCAO’s response to sexual assault violated federal law. \n  \n The agreement, as well as a description of the Department of Justice’s work regarding sexual assault in\n Missoula, Montana, will be available at: http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/ .\n14-618 Civil Rights Division\n \nABOUT   RESOURCES    CAREERS\nSite Map   For Employees\nThe Attorney General Forms Legal Careers Archive Office of the Inspector\nBudget & Performance Publications Interns, Recent Graduates, Accessibility  General\n and Fellows\nStrategic Plans Case Highlights FOIA Government\nDiversity Policy  Resources\nLegislative Histories   No FEAR Act\nAGENCIES Veteran Recruitment Information Quality Plain Writing\nUSA.gov\nPrivacy Policy\nBUSINESS NEWS CONTACT Legal Policies & BusinessUSA\nBusiness Opportunities Justice News  Disclaimers\nThe Justice Blog\nS Bmuasilnl &es Dsisadvantaged Public Schedule  \nGrants Videos\nPhoto Gallery\nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/June/14-crt-618.html[6/10/2014 6:32:57 PM]",

      "title": "Re: The United States' Investigation of the Missoula County Attorney's Office",
      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \n950 Pennsylvania Ave, NW \nWashington DC 20530 \nFEB 14 2014 \nVIA EMAIL AND U.S. MAIL \nMr. Fred Van Valkenburg \nCounty Attorney \nMissoula County Courthouse \n200 West Broadway \nMissoula, Montana  59802 \nRe:  The United States' Investigation of the Missoula County Attorney's Office \nDear Mr. VanValkenburg: \nAs you know, for the last ten months, the Civil Rights Division (\"Division\"), in \npartnership with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Montana, has been engaged in an \ninvestigation of the Missoula County Attorney's Office (the \"County Attorney's Office\" or \n\"MCAO\") concerning allegations of bias by the County Attorney's Office in the investigation \nand handling of sexual assault cases.  This letter summarizes the evidence we have uncovered to \ndate and describes the legal framework for assessing whether a constitutional or statutory \nviolation has occurred.!  As you are aware, we have delayed issuing this letter in the hopes that \nwe might agree upon remedies to address the problems our investigation has found.  You so far \nhave been unwilling to respond to or even discuss the set of remedies we have proposed. \nNonetheless, we are hopeful that, in light of your January 9, 2014 letter indicating a desire \"to \nresolve this matter amicably,\" this letter can serve as a starting point for us to meet with you \npromptly and discuss a mutually agreeable resolution that will best serve the people of Missoula \nCounty, rather than expending scarce resources on protracted litigation. \nWe are aware of the complaint for declaratory judgment that you recently filed.  As we \nhave discussed on several occasions, and as set out further below - and contrary to each claim \nraised in your complaint - the Department of Justice has jurisdiction to investigate and to seek \ninjunctive reliefto remedy discriminatory conduct.  This jurisdiction arises from both the Violent \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (\"Section 14141\"), and the \nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968,42 U.S.C. § 3789d (\"Safe Streets Act\"). \nThis letter is sent pursuant to these authorities. \n1 Previous to this letter, the Division's Special Litigation Section investigated and publicly issued findings regarding \nthe response to sexual assault by five other law enforcement agencies:  the New Orleans (LA) Police Department; \nthe Maricopa COIDlty (AZ) Sheriffs Office; the Puerto Rico Police Department; and, most recently, the University \nof Montana's Office of Public Safety and the Missoula Police Department.  All but one of these law enforcement \nagencies - the Maricopa County Sheriffs Office - have entered into agreements with DOJ, aimed at cooperatively \nresolving the issues identified in DOJ's investigations and fmdings letters. DOJ initiated a civil lawsuit against the \nMaricopa County Sheriffs Office, based on the concerns described in its letter of findings, in May 2012. \n\nIn April 2012, we informed you of our investigation into allegations of bias regarding the \nMCAO's response to sexual assault cases and invited you to work with us as we explored these \nallegations.  You declined, and throughout the investigation you have refused to provide \nrequested documents, information, or access to staff for interviews.  Despite this, we have \nlearned significant information by reviewing documents available from other sources and by \ninterviewing persons knowledgeable about the policies, training, and practices related to the \nCounty Attorney's Office's investigation and prosecution of sexual assault. \nOur investigation to date has revealed substantial evidence suggesting that MCAO's \nresponse to allegations of sexual assault and rape discriminates against women and that this \ndiscrimination is fueled, at least in part, by gender bias.  This bias erodes public confidence in \nthe criminal justice system, places women in Missoula at increased risk of harm, and reinforces \ningrained stereotypes about women.  It also undennines sexual assault investigations in Missoula \nfrom the outset, impairing the ability of both police and prosecutors to uncover the truth in these \ncases and hold perpetrators of sexual violence accountable. \nIn addition, our investigation indicates that the County Attorney's Office has often failed \nto take the steps necessary to develop sexual assault cases properly so that informed and fair \nprosecutorial assessments may be made.  As a result, female sexual assault victims in Missoula \nare deprived of fundamental legal protections and often re-victimized by MCAO's response to \ntheir reports of abuse. \nSpecifically, our investigation has uncovered evidence indicating that the County \nAttorney's Office engages in a pattern or practice of gender discrimination in violation of the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitntion and \nrelevant statutes.  In particular, there are strong indications that the decisions of the County \nAttorney's Office regarding the investigation and prosecution of sexual assaults and rape, \nparticularly non-stranger assaults and rapes, are influenced by gender bias and gender \nstereotyping and adversely affect women in Missoula. \nThe County Attorney's conduct must be viewed in its totality.  While no single fact is \ndeterminative, the following facts - talcen together - strongly suggest discrimination: \n•  Sexual assaults of adult women are given low priority in the County Attorney's \nOffice; \n•  Adult women victims, particularly victims of non-stranger sexual assault and \nrape, are often treated with disrespect, not informed of the statns of their case, and \nre-victimized by the process - in many instances, victims are not even \ninterviewed by a prosecutor before the decision is made to decline charging their \ncase or to offer a plea agreement to the perpetrator; \n•  The County Attorney's Office neither has its own dedicated victim-witness \npersonnel, as are routinely employed in prosecutors' offices across the nation, nor \nsufficiently coordinates with the Missoula Crime Victim Advocate Office to \nensure the proper and respectful treatment of and communication with victims; \n2 \n\n•  The County Attorney's Office routinely fails to engage in the most basic \ncommunication about its cases of sexual assault with other law enforcement and \nother partners; \n•  The County Attorney's Office generally does not develop evidence in support of \nsexual assault prosecutions, either on its own or in cooperation with other law \nenforcement agencies; and \n•  Not until we began our investigation did the County Attorney's Office begin \nproviding Deputy County Attorneys with the basic knowledge and training about \nsexual assault necessary to effectively and impartially investigate and prosecute \nthese cases.  This training remains insufficient and incomplete. \nOur investigation indicates that an institutionalized indifference to crimes of sexual \nviolence, coupled with bias against the women who represent the overwhelming majority of \nvictims of sexual assault, handicaps the County Attorney's Office's ability to protect victims of \n. crime effectively or handle sexual assault cases fairly.  Women consistently told us that Deputy \nCounty Attorneys treated them with indifference or disrespect, and frequently made statements \nto women victims, advocates, and the public diminishing the seriousness of sexual violence and \nminimizing the culpability of those who commit it.  We learned that prosecutors did not \ncommunicate with female victims about their cases, did not inform them of the charges to be \nfiled and did not seek their input about the type of relief to seek against the accused if convicted. \nIn many cases, prosecutors failed even to return victims' phone calls. \nManifested in these ways, the County Attorney's Office's handling of crimes of sexual \nassault is indicative of unlawful gender bias, perpetuates a culture that tolerates sexual assault, \ndissuades victims from reporting crimes, leaves violent criminal activity unaddressed, and \ncompromises the safety of all women in Missoula.  Such a situation strongly suggests that \nMCAO stands in violation of the Constitution and federal anti-discrimination laws.  See Village \nofA rlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977) (law \nenforcement action with adverse discriminatory impact violates the Fourteenth Amendment \nwhen it is motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory purpose). \nWe also have repeatedly emphasized, in discussions with you and your Office, that our \ninvestigation is focused on the MCAO's policies and practices, not the CountyAttorney's \nexercise ofprosecutorial discretion.  We do not seek to second-guess the decisions of you or \nyour attorneys to charge an individual with a crime.  Our goal has been and continues to be \nidentifying gender bias where it may exist in MCAO policies and practices; eliminating that bias \nin a constructive and cooperative manner; and thereby enhancing the public's trust in your \nOffice's ability to respond to and make effective prosecutorial decisions about allegations of \nsexual assault and better protecting women in Missoula. \nBACKGROUND \nOur investigation of MCAO was part ofa larger inquiry conducted by the Division's \nSpecial Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Montana.  It focused \nnot only on the role of the County Attorney's Office but also on the actions of the University of \n3 \n\nMontana's Office of Public Safety (\"OPS\") and the Missoula Police Department (\"Missoula \nPolice\" or \"MPD\") in handling allegations of sexual assault against women in Missoula.  In May \n2013, the Civil Rights Division reached agreements with those two agencies.  The Division's \nEducational Opportunities Section also concluded an investigation ofthe University of Montana \nand reached an agreement to protect students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.  At the \nsame time it announced these agreements, the Division issued letters documenting its findings \nregarding OPS, the Missoula Police, and the University of Montana.2  The reforms carried out \npursuant to those findings and agreements have already begun to improve the response of \nMissoula law enforcement to sexual assault and to serve as models for other campuses and \ncommunities nationwide. \nThe Division's investigation was prompted by widely expressed community concerns \nthat Missoula law enforcement, including the County Attorney's Office, was failing to respond \nappropriately to reports of sexual assault, both on the University of Montana campus and \nelsewhere in Missoula.  We received information indicating that the MCAO failed to pursue \nviable sexual assault prosecutions and that this reflected problematic dynamics beyond the \ngenerally acknowledged challenges of prosecuting sex crimes.  There were concerns in Missoula \nthat, as a result, women reporting sexual assaults were being denied access to criminal justice, \nand perpetrators of sexual assault were not being held accountable.  There were further concerns \nthat because of the experience many women had with the criminal justice system in Missoula, \nincluding the widely held perception of poor treatment of women reporting sexual assault, many \nvictims chose not to report the crime. \nThe Special Litigation Section brought its investigation of the County Attorney's Office \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141, and the Safe Streets Act.  Specifically, the investigation sought to \ndetennine whether the County Attorney's Office, as well as the Missoula Police Department and \nthe University of Montana's Office of Public Safety, engage in a pattern or practice of unlawful \ngender discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Safe Streets Act, and the \nregulations implementing the Safe Streets Act, 28 C.F.R. §§ 42.201-215.  Under these laws, the \nCounty Attorney's Office is prohibited from discriminating against female sexual assault \nvictims. \nUnder Section 14141(a), \"[ilt shall be unlawful for any governmental authority, or any \nagent thereof, or any person acting on behalf of a governmental authority to engage in a pattern \nor practice of conduct by law enforcement officers ... that deprives persons of rights, privileges, \nor immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"  Section \n14141(b) gives the Attorney General the authority to seek \"equitable and declaratory relief to \neliminate the pattern or practice.\" \n2 See http://www.justice.gov/crtlaboutlspllfiudsettle.php#police (under \"Montana\") and \nhttp://www.justice.gov/crtlaboutleduldocuments/c1asslist.php (under \"Sex\"). The investigation of sex discrimination \nby the University of Montana was conducted by the Division's Educational Opportunities Section pursuant to Title \nIV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-6, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000h-2. \n4 \n\nThe Safe Streets Act provides in part that \"[ n]o person in any State shall on the ground of \nrace, color, religion, national origin, or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under or denied employment in connection with \nany programs or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this title.\" \nSection 3789d(c)(1).  The Safe Streets Act further authorizes the Attorney General to file a civil \nsuit \"[ w ]henever the Attorney General has reason to believe that a State government or unit of \nlocal government has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice in violation ofthe \nprovisions of this section.\"  Section 3789d(c)(3).  The County Attorney's Office is covered by \nSection 3789 as a recipient offederal funding authorized under the Safe Streets Act. \nThe County Attorney's Office serves as the state prosecutor in Missoula and employs 17 \nDeputy County Attorneys in two sections, criminal and civil.  The Criminal Division prosecutes \nall felony offenses that occur in Missoula County and all offenses that occur in the County \noutside Missoula city limits.  The County Attorney's Office has been led by the same County \nAttorney since 1998.3 \nMETHODOLOGY \nThe Special Litigation Section's investigation of Missoula law enforcement has to date \nincluded interviews with law enforcement officers and with advocates, victims, witnesses, and \nother members of the Missoula community, in person over the course of 13 days on-site in \nMissoula and by telephone over the past year and a half.  Our interviews included conversations \n4 \nwith a former sex-crimes prosecutor with MCAO; former Missoula Police Chief Mark Muir and \nnine Missoula Police detectives and officers; representatives of 12 local, statewide, and \nuniversity organizations that work on behalf of women and victims of sexual assault; and more \nthan 30 women reportedly victimized by sexual assault in Missoula, or their representatives. \nWe engaged two expert consultants, one with nearly a decade of experience supervising a \npolice department's sex-crimes unit and the other a former sex-crimes prosecutor and national \ntraining consultant in sexual assault response.  With them, we reviewed policies, procedures, \ntraining materials, case files, related court filings, and other data and documentary evidence, \nincluding the case files for the more than 350 reports of sexual assault received by the Missoula \nPolice between January 2008 and May 2012.  We have made every effort to confirm witness \naccounts, where possible, with other evidence, including police reports, transcripts, and video \nrecordings of investigative interviews, and gave weight only to those statements we could \ncorroborate or otherwise deem credible.  We have consulted with a wide range of advocates, \npractitioners, and academics with expertise in this field; reviewed academic studies and \nliterature; reviewed Montana state laws relevant to the law enforcement and advocacy response \nto sexual assault;5 and reviewed national prosecution standards and training materials published \n3 Missoula COIDlty Attorney Home, Missoula County Official Website, http://www.co.missoula.mt.us/cattorney/ \n(last visited Feb. 14,2014). \n4 Mark Muir retired as Chief of the Missoula Police Department on December 20,2013. \n5 Missoula advocates and attorneys expressed frustration with the limitations that Montana's sexual assault laws and \nsentencing standards impose on law enforcement's ability to effectively seek criminal justice for victims of sexual \nassault.  Without expressing an opinion on these laws, we found that Montana law neither explains nOf excuses the \ndeficiencies discussed in this letter. \n5 \n\nby the National District Attorneys Association (\"NOAA\") and the American Bar Association \n(\"ABA,,).6 \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nThe Constitution and federal statutes prohibit discrimination by law enforcement, \nincluding prosecutors, in responding to reports of sexual assault.  When this discrimination \namounts to a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct, the United States can sue for equitable and \ndeclaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 or the Safe Streets Act or both.  Sex discrimination by \nlaw enforcement may occur in either of two ways:  where law enforcement practices reflect \nintentional sex discrimination, or where law enforcement practices have an unjustifiable \ndisparate impact. \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits intentional sex \ndiscrimination, including selective or discriminatory enforcement of the law.  Whren v.  United \nStates, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996) (\"[T]he Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law \nbased on considerations such as race.\"); Elliot-Park v. Manglona, 592 FJd 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. \n2010) (Equal Protection Clause prohibits law enforcement from intentionally discriminating in \nthe provision of any services to any degree); Estate ofM  acias v. Ihde, 219 FJd 1018, 1019, 1028 \n(9th Cir. 2000) (in case alleging \"inferior police protection on account of status as a woman, a \nLatina, and a victim of domestic violence,\" holding that there is an equal-protection right to have \nlaw enforcement services administered in a nondiscriminatory manner). \nIn addition to affirmative discrimination against members of protected groups, a failure to \ntake action, on a discriminatory basis, can constitute unlawful discrimination.  See DeShaney v. \nWinnebago County Dept. ofS ocial Services, 489 U.S. 189, 197 nJ (1989) (\"The State may not, \nof course, selectively deny its protective services to certain disfavored minorities without \nviolating the Equal Protection Clause.\"); Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 311 (1964) (Goldberg, \nJ., concurring) (\"[D]enying the equal protection of the laws includes the omission to protect.\"). \nThe Ninth Circuit has explained specifically that the constitutional right to have law enforcement \nservices delivered in a nondiscriminatory manner \"is violated when a state actor denies such \nprotection\" to members of protected groups on a prohibited basis.  Estate ofM  acias, 219 FJd at \n1028 .. The courts have applied this principle to under-enforcement of the law when deliberate \nunder-enforcement adversely affects women.  See, e.g., id.; Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep 't, \n901 F.2d 696,700-01 (9th Cir. 1988) (recognizing an Equal Protection claim based upon the \ndiscriminatory denial oflaw enforcement services to a victim of domestic violence because of \nher sex). \nLaw enforcement action violates the Fourteenth Amendment when a discriminatory \npurpose is a contributing factor; discrimination need not be the sole motivation for the action or \nfailure to act to violate the Constitution.  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265-66.  Recognizing \nthat discriminatory purpose is rarely admitted or blatant, courts look to the totality of \n6 See, e.g., Na!'l Dis!. Att'ys Ass'n, National Prosecution Standards (3d ed. updated 2009), \nhttp://www.ndaa.org/publications.html; Am. Bar Ass'n, Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecutorial Function \nStandards. \n6 \n\ncircumstances to evaluate whether a law enforcement activity or a failure to act was motivated \nby discriminatory intent.  Courts will consider factors that indirectly indicate an intent to \ndiscriminate.  A \"not exhaustive\" summary of the factors that courts may properly consider in \nconducting an inquiry includes:  evidence of discriminatory impact; the \"historical background\" \nof the challenged discriminatory conduct; evidence of departures from \"the normal procedural \nsequence\" or \"substantive departures\" from a decision, \"particularly if the factors considered by \nthe decision maker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached\"; and contemporaneous \nstatements by the decision maker.  See id. at 265-68; see also Balistreri, 901 F.2d at 701 \n(evidence of police officer's statement to domestic violence victim that ''he did not blame [the \nvictim's] husband for hitting her, because of the way she was 'carrying on,'\" \"strongly suggest[ s] \nan intention to treat domestic abuse cases less seriously than other assaults, as well as an animus \nagainst abused women\"). \nDifferential treatment of women premised on sex-based stereotypes, including \nstereotypes about the role women should play in society or how they should behave, also violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  See, e.g., United States v.  Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 517 (1996) \n(holding invalid explicit sex-based classification, and stating that \"generalizations about 'the way \nwomen are,' estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying \nopportunity to women\"); Nevada Dep 't a/Hum. Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 730 (2003) \n(\"Reliance on such [invalid gender] stereotypes cannot justify the State's gender discrimination \n[in employment].\"); Mississippi Univ.for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 726 (1982) (holding \nthat denying otherwise qualified males the right to enroll in state nursing school violated the \nEqual Protection Clause).  Thus, where a law enforcement agency's failure to adequately \nrespond to allegations of sexual assault is premised, at least in part, on sex-based stereotypes, \nthat failure violates the Equal Protection Clause. \nWhen law enforcement's handling of sexual assault cases is intentionally discriminatory \nor has an unnecessary disparate impact, it also violates the Safe Streets Act and its implementing \nregulations.  A disparate impact violates the Safe Streets Act and its implementing regulations, \neven where the discrimination is not intentional, unless the defendant can demonstrate that the \ndiscriminatory impact is necessitated by some legitimate law enforcement or other purpose.  See \n28 C.F.R. § 42.203 (prohibiting recipients of federal funds made available under the Safe Streets \nAct from \"utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting \nindividuals to discrimination\") (emphasis added); see also United States v.  Virginia, 620 F.2d \n1018, 10 22 (4th Cir. 1980) (Safe Streets Act requires showing that defendants' discriminatory \nemployment practices had an adverse impact on female job applicants, not proof of intentional \ndiscrimination, before defendants must demonstrate that challenged practices have a necessary \nrelationship to the job). \nThe Safe Streets Act applies to entities receiving federal funds during the time ofthe \ndiscriminatory acts.  The United States has jurisdiction to address discrimination based on gender \nby the County Attorney through the Safe Streets Act because the County Attorney's Office has \nreceived qualifying federal funding during the period in question and during the current fiscal \nyear. \n7 \n\nDISCUSSION \nProsecuting sex crimes is difficult.  They often present investigative and evidentiary \nchallenges that other crimes do not.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, the County \nAttorney's Office's frequent failure to prosecute sexual assaults of women stands out.  Based on \nan analysis ofthe information available to us, between January 2008 and May 2012, the \nMissoula Police referred 85 reports of sexual assault of adult women to the County Attorney's \nOffice.  According to the Missoula Police, a referral to the County Attorney's Office indicates \nthat the Missoula Police has concluded its investigation of the case and is recommending that the \ncase be prosecuted.  During that same period, the County Attorney's Office filed charges in only \n14 of the 85 reports of sexual assault referred for prosecution -less than 17 percent.  During that \nsame period, the County Attorney's Office notified the Missoula Police that it had declined \nprosecution in 42 of these 85 referrals, and all but one of these declinations involved a non \nstranger sexual assault.7  The County Attorney's Office did not provide any notification to the \nMissoula Police in the remaining 29 cases. \nMCAO's failure to prosecute sexual assault, particularly non-stranger sexual assault, does \nnot seem to reflect inherent or insurmountable evidentiary hurdles.  Rather, it is indicative of bias \nin the way the County Attorney's Office responds to sexual assault cases as a class.  It also \ndemonstrates how ill-prepared MCAO is with respect to prosecuting the bulk of sexual assault \ncases it receives from the Missoula Police.  As discussed further below, our investigation \nrevealed evidence that MCAO has a general disregard for sexual assault cases and the women \nwho report them.  This disregard is apparent in statements made by the County Attorney and \nDeputy County Attorneys, and in the manner in which Deputy County Attorneys interact with, or \nfail to interact with, women reporting sexual assault. \nMCAO's bias against women victims of sexual assault is also apparent in its handling of \nnon-stranger sexual assault cases, its failure to explain or document its decisions not to file \ncharges in those cases, and what appear to be excessively long delays in completing its work in \ncases of sexual assault.  Deputy County Attorneys often do not work with, or in some cases even \ncommunicate with, Missoula Police detectives to develop evidence for prosecution or to explain \nwhy existing evidence is insufficient to charge a case.  They failed to communicate with victims \nabout charging decisions or the status of their cases.  Before our recent resolution with OPS and \nMPD, Deputy County Attorneys lacked sufficient training in the legal and scientific knowledge \n7 We arrived at these numbers by comparing sexual assault and rape charges filed in the Missoula District Court \nbetween January 1, 2008, and May 1, 2012, with MPD case reports involving adult women referred to the County \nAttorney's Office during the sarne time period.  Additional analyses of the 29 cases referred for prosecution by MPD \nbetween January 2008 and May 2012 that the COlmty Attorney's Office neither prosecuted nor expressly declined \nfor prosecution was precluded by the COlmty Attorney's refusal to cooperate with our investigation.  While the \nCounty Attorney's Office filed charges against 68 defendants in sexual assault cases between January 2008 and May \n2012, insofar as we can detemaine based on the information available to us, only 14 of these involved adult women \nand were referred by MPD after January 1,2008. For our comparison to be accurate, we had to restrict our count of \nprosecutions to prosecutions of cases referred after January 1,2008. Also to ensure an accurate comparison, we \nexcluded referrals from agencies other than MPD (such as the Missoula County Sheriff's Office) because, without \nthe cooperation of the County Attorney, we did not know the number of referrals from other agencies and thus could \nnot calculate the prosecution rate for those referrals. \n8 \n\nand strategies necessary to effectively prosecute sexual assault against women.  These and other \npractices related to the prosecution of non-stranger sexual assault cases are at odds with the \npractices of prosecutors' offices around the nation and run counter to guidance set forth by the \nNDAA and the ABA. \nIn addition, MCAO's approach to sexual violence in Missoula has had significant, \ndetrimental impacts on the law enforcement community's overall response to sexual assault.  The \nwork of Missoula Police detectives is compromised by the fact that, even if they expend the \nresources to conduct a comprehensive investigation, the County Attorney's Office often will not \ncharge the case.  One woman reported that the Missoula Police detective in her case infonned \nher that because \"no one had a limb cut off and there was no video of the incident,\" prosecutors \n\"wouldn't see this [the rape] as anything more than a girl getting drunk at a party.\" Whether or \nnot the detective's characterization was accurate, the County Attorney's actions over time left \nthis detective -and many others like him -with the understanding that non-stranger sexual \nassault of women, and especially drug-facilitated sexual assault, must involve physical force or \noverwhelming and irrefutable evidence to be considered a crime worthy of prosecution. \nFor victims of sexual assault, MCAO's response indicates that a decision to report and \nparticipate in an assault investigation will be, at best, a waste of time or, at worst, a re \nvictimization.  Indeed, in one case from early 2013, a detective told both the victim and the \noffender that the detective's role was limited to collecting physical evidence of sexual assault \nand that the County Attorney's Office would never file charges in the case - despite the fact that \nthe detective acknowledged to the victim that she had been raped by the offender.  Similarly, the \nadvocates, social service providers, police officers, and medical and mental health professionals \nwho together comprise Missoula's sexual assault response team (the First Step Resource Center \nMultidisciplinary Team) are undennined and discouraged by a County Attorney's Office that \napparently leaves sexual assault and rape laws largely unenforced. \nMoreover, MCAO's inability to investigate adequately or file charges in cases of sexual \nassault has an adverse effect not only on survivors of sexual assault, but also on the safety of \nwomen in the Missoula community as a whole.  Since the majority of sexual assaults are \ncommitted by repeat offenders,8 the effect is compounded because perpetrators who escape \nprosecution remain in the community to reoffend. \nDeficiencies in the County Attorney's Office's Response to Sexual Assault Indicate an \nImpermissible Bias Against Female Victims of These Crimes \nOur investigation to date has developed evidence indicating that the County Attorney's \nOffice's failure to adequately respond to sexual assault results at least in part from unlawful bias \nagainst women who report sexual assault, and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendmeot and the statutes that we enforce.  See United States v. Armstrong, 517 \nU.S. 456, 465 (1996); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-40 (1976) (a governmental entity \n8 M. Claire Harwell & David Lisak, Why Rapists Run Free, Sexual Assault Report, Vol. 14, No.2, at 17-27 \n(Nov.lDec. 2010) (research \"clearly demonstrates that most rapes are in fact committed by serial offenders\"); Nat'l \nDist. Att'ys Ass'n, National Prosecution Standards Pt. II cmt. to § 2-9. \n9 \n\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause when it adopts a policy or practice that has an adverse effect \non a protected group and its actions are motivated in part by discriminatory intent). \nThe question of whether bias motivates the actions of a law enforcement agency must be \nassessed by considering the totality of circumstances.

The County Attorney's Office's practices discussed below indicate \nits failure to vindicate the rights of women victims of sexual assault and suggest that MCAO is \nviolating the law.  See Estate o/Macias, 219 FJd at 1028 (discriminatory failure to enforce the \nlaw or otherwise administer governmental services violates equal protection). \nTogether, these failures reflect the County Attorney's Office's disregard for crimes of \nsexual assault - one of the most violent categories of crimes, and a category of crime whose \nvictims are overwhelmingly female.  According to the Montana Board of Crime Control, across \nthe State of Montana, 800 adult women were victims of sexual assault in 2012, compared to 180 \nmen.9  Of the most serious assaults, rape and forcible sodomy, the gender disparity is even more \nlopsided:  368 adult women victims and 43 men.  Missoula County reported to the State 102 \nlo \nsexual assaults and rapes against adult women and 21 against men for the same period. See \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266 (\"Detennining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was \na motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into circumstantial and direct evidence of intent \nas may be available.  The impact of the official action-whether it bears more heavily on one \n[group1   than another - may provide an important starting point.\") (quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \n1.  The County Attorney's Office's Treatment of Female Victims of Sexual \nAssault Indicates a Significant Level of Animus Toward These Women \nUnder Montana law, a prosecutor is required to consult with victims offelony and \nmisdemeanor offenses \"involving actual, threatened, or potential bodily injury to the victim,\" \nincluding sexual assault, to obtain the victim's views about the disposition of the case, including \nabout plea negotiations.  See Mont. Code Ann. § 46-24-104 (2013).  Our investigation has shown \nthat the County Attorney's Office often neglects to hold these consultations with sexual assault \nvictims, in contravention of Montana law.  And the interactions that the County Attorney's \nOffice does have with victims of sexual assault often leave them feeling offended, disregarded, \nand disbelieved by prosecutors.  The comments made by prosecutors and their treatment of these \nvictims suggest gender bias on the part of those charged with the obligation to prosecute crimes \nin Missoula.  Such bias is unlawful where it results in decisions and conduct that discriminate \nagainst women. \nIn one instance, for example, a Deputy County Attorney quoted religious passages to a \nwoman who had reported a sexual assault, in a way that the victim interpreted to mean that the \n9 See http://mbcc.mt.gov(lastvisitedJan. 13,2014). \n10 [d. \n10 \n\nDeputy County Attorney was judging her negatively for having made the report.  We also spoke \nto a woman whose daughter was sexually assaulted, at the age of five, by an adolescent boy.  In \nresponse to a question about why the perpetrator had been sentenced to only two years of \ncommunity service, the prosecutor handling the case reportedly told the woman that \"boys will \nbe boys.\" Advocates told us that Deputy County Attorneys \"said terrible things to victims,\" \nincluding saying to one woman, in the course of discussing the decision not to prosecute her \nsexual assault, \"All you want is revenge.\" \nOne woman described her interaction with a Deputy County Attorney as \"traumatic.\" \nAnother woman stated that, by the time the prosecution was over, she was so frustrated by the \nDeputy County Attorney's treatment and the MCAO's failure to keep her informed about key \ndevelopments in the case that she \"would never suggest\" that another woman pursue a sexual \nassault prosecution in Missoula.  She said further that it \"broke her heart\" that other women had \nto go through a similar process to have their cases prosecuted.  Other women reported that \nprosecutors treated them with \"no compassion,\" and acted like the prosecutors were \"forced to \nspeak\" with them.  Several women informed us that they left meetings with prosecutors feeling \nlike they were being \"judged\" for their prior sexual history, or that the prosecutors did not \nbelieve them. \nSome women told us that they or others had declined to pursue prosecution because of \nthe negative accounts they had heard from friends and acquaintances about their treatment by the \nCounty Attorney's Office.  For instance, we interviewed a young woman who had suffered a \ngang rape as a student at the University of Montana and described feeling re-traumatized by the \nexperience of seeking to have the assault prosecuted by the County Attorney's Office.  As a \nresult of hearing about that experience, a friend of the woman declined to report her own rape to \neither the police or to prosecutors.  In another example, a clinical psychologist told us that she \nhad counseled numerous sexual assault survivors in Missoula who had pursued criminal charges \nagainst their assailants and described their experience with the County Attorney's Office as \nbeing so horrendous that, when the psychologist herself was sexually assaulted, she was reluctant \nto have her case prosecuted by the County Attorney's Office. \nIn addition to the types of troubling statements and treatment of women described above, \nprosecutors compound the trauma sexual assault victims experience by failing to convey \nimportant information about charging decisions and other aspects of sexual assault cases to \nwomen directly, in a timely manner, or sometimes at all.  For example, we heard from women \nthat they had to repeatedly request information and updates from MCAO attorneys handling their \ncases.  They told us that the County Attorney's Office failed to initiate communication with \nthem, did not provide status updates or notices of scheduling changes for court dates, and, unless \nrepeatedly prompted, did not even explain expectations for testifying witnesses in advance of \nhearings.  As a result, the task of infonning women about charging decisions generally falls to \ndetectives with the Missoula Police or to advocates with the Missoula Crime Victim Advocate \nOffice, despite the fact that those detectives and advocates are not involved in the prosecutor's \ndecision-making process and thus cannot describe that process in any depth. \nOne woman told us, for example, that she had no contact with the County Attorney's \nOffice during the year after her first and only meeting with the prosecuting attorney handling her \n11 \n\ncase.  She only learned that the prosecutor had offered her assailant a plea agreement from an \nadvocate with the Missoula Crime Victim Advocate Office, despite the fact that she and her \nmother had left numerous phone messages for the prosecuting attorney throughout the year.  The \nwoman told us that she had understood nothing about the Deputy County Attorney's decision to \nfile charges in her case or reasons for offering a plea agreement; that she was frustrated both by \nwhat she believed to be a weak plea agreement and by MCAO's lack of responsiveness and \nregard for her perspective; and that the County Attorney's Office had made her and her mother \n\"feel like [the case] wasn't that important\" to the Office.  Her advice to other women reporting \nsexual assault in Missoula, she said, would be \"if at all possible, not to go\" to the County \nAttorney's Office.  Her statement underscores the reality that, where prosecutors fail to \ncommunicate with women directly, it discourages not only their own participation in the criminal \njustice process but also that of others who hear about their negative experiences with the justice \nsystem. \nIn another case, when the woman finally did meet with the prosecutor assigned to her \ncase, she described getting the sense that the prosecutor was 'just telling [her] what [he] \nwant[ed] her to know.\"  This woman asked a Missoula Police detective whom she trusted to \naccompany her to the meeting to support her and ensure that her questions were answered fully \nand completely.  Through her own advocacy and the detective's prompting, they learned that the \ndefendant's psychosexual evaluation, which provided infonnation relevant to sentencing, had \nbeen conducted by doctors of the defendant's choosing.  During the evaluation, the defendant \nhad stated that the rape - to which he had already confessed - had been consensual.  No one, \nhowever, challenged this statement.  The WOll)an explained to the prosecutor that the evaluation \ncould not, therefore, be considered particularly reliable.  Although MCAO could request a \nsecond evaluation, she learned, thanks to the detective's questioning, that it almost never did so. \nlt is the rare sexual assault victim who will advocate for herself in this manner, and access to \ncriminal justice should not depend upon self-advocacy. \nMCAO's failure to communicate regularly and appropriately with complaining witnesses \nis exacerbated by the Office's failure adequately to coordinate and communicate with crime \nadvocates, either by having advocates on staff, or by making proper use of available crime \nadvocates.  The Missoula Crime Victim Advocate Office is located right outside of the County \nAttorney's Office and has a memorandum of understanding with MCAO to notify victims of the \ncourt dates where they have a right to be present.  Nonetheless, we were told that the County \nAttorney's Office almost never solicits the involvement of the Crime Victim Advocate Office \nwith its complaining witnesses in cases of sexual assault.  Rather, the burden of identifying and \ncommunicating with complaining witnesses falls entirely to the Crime Victim Advocate Office, \nwhose advocates do a daily review of jail rosters to identify potential victims of sexual assault. \nMoreover, the Crime Victim Advocate Office is only rarely included in in-person meetings \nbetween Deputy County Attorneys and complaining witnesses.  Nor is the Crime Victim \nAdvocate Office involved in working with victims before a case is charged, even though this is \nwhen prosecutors need to demonstrate that they will support a meritorious victim through a \ndifficult process. \nTreating women with disregard in this manner not only provides evidence of bias and \nundennines MCAO's ability to successfully prosecute sexual assault cases, it also directly \n12 \n\ncontravenes national standards for prosecutors.  The National District Attorneys Association's \nstandards, for example, require prosecutors to keep victims infonned about their cases, to \"be \nmindful of the possibility of intimidation and harm arising from a witness's cooperation with law \nenforcement,\" and, to the extent feasible and appropriate, to provide assistance and protection to \nwitnesses of crime. I I  Indeed, the NDAA commentary to these standards states that \"[e  ]ffective \nprosecution includes a sound understanding ofthe value of victims and witnesses within the \ncriminal justice system,\" and that prosecutors have an obligation \"to facilitate the relationship \nwith victims and witnesses\" to encourage victims to report crime and \"follow[ ] through with \nidentifications, statements, and testimony. ,,12 \n2.  Public Commeuts by the County Attorney Raise Concerns of Impermissible \nGender Bias \nPublic comments you have made further suggest that, at the very least, sexual assault is \nnot a high priority for MeAO.  Such comments are probative of discriminatory intent, Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 266-68 (\"contemporary statements\" by decision makers \"may be highly \nrelevant\" in detennining discriminatory intent), and add to the totality of circumstances \nindicating impennissible gender bias by the County Attorney's Office, Balistreri, 901 F.2d at 701 \n(statements from decision makers that reflect gender-based stereotypes and bias are among the \nfactors that courts will consider in assessing discriminatory intent). \nFor example, in responding to questions about delays in charging decisions, you \nreportedly said that your attorneys review charging decisions in sexual assault cases \"when they \nhave spare time.,,13  While you have subsequently attempted to explain that by \"spare time\" you \nwere referring to the \"additional time\" after other courtroom and litigation functions have been \ncompleted, the statement seems inconsistent with the diligent investigation and prosecution of \n14 \nsexual abuse.\nAdditionally, you reportedly told the Independent Reviewer for the Division's \nagreements with the Missoula Police and the University'S Office of Public Safety (the \n\"Independent Reviewer\") that, rather than having attorneys review sexual assault investigations \nto assess the merits of the case, they \"rely on [Missoula Police] detectives to stay on top ofthe \n[a]ttorneys to get the decisions they need,\" and \"that ifhe does not hear from the detective of the \ncase he assumes the case is not a priority for the detective.\"ls  The statement seems to suggest \nthat unless a detective is willing to aggressively push attorneys in your Office to prosecute sexual \nassault cases, there is little chance that such cases will receive serious consideration.  We note \nlOU \nthat you have recently acknowledged that  are starting to work on a protocol to ensure timely \ncharging decisions in sexual abuse cases.l \n11 Nat'l Dist.

The County Attorney's Office's Handling of Non-Stranger Sexual Assault \nCases and Its Failure to Explain or Document Its Decisions Not to File \nCharges in Those Cases Raise Further Concerns of Impermissible \nDiscrimination \nWhile, as stated above, this investigation is not aimed at second-guessing the exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion, the County Attorney's handling of non-stranger sexual assault cases, \nand its consistent failure to explain or document its decisions not to file charges in those cases, \nraises further concerns about impermissible bias.  Cf. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267 (it may \nbe further relevant evidence of decision makers' purposes \"if the factors usually considered \nimportant by the decision maker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached\"). \nAfter an extensive review of police files, our prosecutorial expert concluded that the \nfactors considered as part ofthe charging decision process depart from the standards ofthe \nprofession.  In some cases reviewed by our expert, for example, Missoula Police officers had \ndeveloped substantial evidence to support prosecution, but MCAO, without documented \nexplanation, declined to charge the case.  Non-stranger sexual assault cases rarely have evidence \nof significant force being used, a confession, or an eyewitness account.l7  But our investigation \nto date reveals that the County Attorney's Office declined to prosecute some sexual assault cases \neven where it did have a confession or an eyewitness. \nIn one case, for example, the Missoula Police obtained a confession from a man who \nadmitted raping a woman while she was unconscious.  The Missoula Police referred the case to \nthe County Attorney's Office with a recommendation that the prosecutor charge the suspect with \nsexual intercourse without consent, as well as car theft.  The County Attorney's Office declined \nto bring any charges, citing \"insufficient evidence.\"  In another case, the Missoula Police \nobtained incriminating statements from a suspect who admitted to having intercourse with a \nmentally ill woman, including statements that he couldn't \"determine\" how soon he had stopped \nhaving sex with the woman after she asked him to stop and told him he was causing her \"vagina\" \nto \"hurt.\" The Missoula Police referred the case to the County Attorney's Office, recommending \nthat the prosecutor charge the suspect with sexual intercourse without consent.  Despite the \nincriminating statements, the County Attorney's Office declined to bring any charge in the case. \nOf equal concern, we found that the County Attorney's Office declined to prosecute \nnearly every case of non-stranger assault involving an adult woman victim who was, at the time \nof the assault, subject to some type of heightened vulnerability - for example, in cases where the \nassault was facilitated by drugs or alcohol.  As noted above, the County Attorney's Office \ndeclined prosecution in assaults facilitated by drugs or alcohol, even when the assailant had \nconfessed or made incriminating statements.  This pattern of declining to prosecute sexual \nassault of women with heightened vulnerabilities is particularly troubling given the realities of \nhow perpetrators of sexual assault identify potential victims, and the likelihood of drug- or \n17 See Teresa P. Scalzo, Prosecuting Alcohol-Facilitated Sexual Assault 12 (Nat'l Dis!. Att'ys Ass'n Aug. 2007), \nhttp://www.ndaa.org/pdf/pub ~rosecutinL alcoholjacilitated_ sexual_ assault. pdf (noting that there are \"almost \nnever eyewitoesses to a rape\" and that \"rape cases rarely have physical evidence that conclusively proves that a rape \noccurred\"), \n14 \n\nalcohol-fueled sexual assault affecting women in Missoula.  Women who are intoxicated are at \nincreased risk of sexual assault, and more than half of all non-stranger sexual assault involves \nalcohol use by the victim, assailant alcohol use by the victim, assailant, or both. IS  Moreover, \nwomen in campus settings may be particularly likely to be vulnerable or incapacitated due to \n19 \ndrug or alcohol use.\nWe also found that the County Attorney's Office declined to prosecute nearly every case \nof non-stranger sexual assault involving an adult woman victim who had a mental or physical \ndisability, even in cases where there was evidence such as a confession or incriminating \nstatements by the perpetrator.  Here, too, the County Attorney's Office appears to resist \nprosecuting those sexual assault cases most likely to occur in Missoula.  Local advocates report \nthat Missoula is one of Montana's principal locations for services for persons with mental health \nand physical disabilities and, relatedly, is home to a substantial population of individuals with \nmental health issues, including a significant transient population.  Moreover, women with \ndisabilities are particularly likely to be targeted as victims by perpetrators of sexual assault.20 \nGiven the realities of sexual assault, and the makeup of the population in Missoula, MCAO's \napparent resistance to prosecuting cases of sexual assault against women with disabilities, as well \nas cases of drug- or alcohol-fueled sexual assault, is of particular concern. \nFor instance, a woman reported that she had been drugged and raped by an acquaintance \nthe previous day.  Missoula Police officers developed evidence that included video footage of the \nalleged assailant slipping something into the woman's drink.  The Missoula Police also obtained \nadmissions by the assailant that although he did not remember putting something in the woman's \ndrink, it was possible htl had and, as he slated, \"If I were trying to malce her relax it would be \nXanax.\" When confronted with the video footage, the assailant also stated, \"My memory tells \nme no, but I can't argue with surveillance.\"  The Missoula Police obtained a search warrant for \nthe suspect's home and learned that the suspect had recently refilled prescriptions for two drugs \ncommon in drug-facilitated sexual assaults, including Xanax.  Nonetheless, MCAO declined to \ncharge the case, citing insufficient evidence, but with no documented further explanation?l \n18 See Jeanette Norris, The Relationship Between Alcohol Consumption and Sexual Victimization, Na!'l Online Res. \nCIr. on Violence Against Women, at 1 (Dec. 2008), http://www.vawnet.org/sexual-\nviolence/summary.php?doc_  id~ 16 30&find_ typ~web _ desc _ AR.  . \n19 See Rana Sampson, Acquaintance Rape of College Students, in Problem-Oriented Guides for Police Series Guide \nNo. 17, at 13 (U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office ofCo1ll1nunity Oriented Policing Servs. 2002) (noting that in over 75% \nof college rapes, the offender, victim, or both had consumed alcohol). \n20 Bnreau of Justice Statistics, Crime Against People with Disabilities, Nat'l Crime Victimization Survey, at table 2 \n(2008); Jeanette Norris, The Relationship Between Alcohol Consumption and Sexual Victimization, Na!'l Online \nRes.

See, e.g., Adam Negrusz & \nR.E. Gaensslen, Analytical Developments in Toxicological Investigation of Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault, 376 \nAnalytical & Bioanalytical Chemistry 1192-97 (Apr. 8, 2003) (noting that the sensitivity of the drug screening \ntechnique is crucial, as some compounds commonly used in drug-facilitated sexual assaults are typically \nadministered io a single low dose, and discussing various screeniog techniques). \n15 \n\nMoreover, we found no indication that the County Attorney's Office had given any guidance to \nMissoula Police detectives about how to develop evidence that it believed would be sufficient to \nsupport bringing charges in this case.22 \nBetween 2008 and 2010, the Missoula Police provided a written referral form to the \nCounty Attorney's Office, including a section designed for narrative comments about the reasons \nfor declining prosecution.  MCAO attorneys rarely documented their decision to decline \nprosecution in sexual assault cases in a meaningful way.  The most common comments were \n\"insufficient evidence\" or \"insufficient corroboration.\"  After 2011, the written referral form \ndisappeared from the Missoula Police files we reviewed.  We learned that this was due to \nMCAO's chronic failure to return the form to the Missoula Police - a source of frustration for \nMissoula Police detectives who were often left with no specific information about the reason for \nMCAO's decision not to prosecute, as well as the responsibility of explaining MCAO's decision \nto the victim of the sexual assault. \nAs part of its initial efforts to implement its agreement with DO], MPD is revising and \nreinstating the use of this written referral form, once again seeldng feedback from MCAO about \nits charging decisions in cases referred by the police department.  Although we credit the \nMissoula Police for these efforts, their impact will be limited without the active cooperation of \nthe County Attorney's Office.  MCAO's decision not to provide feedback leaves both Missoula \nPolice detectives and women sexual assault victims in the dark about the MCAO's declination \ndecisions - particularly as the County Attorney's Office consistently relies on Missoula Police \ndetectives to communicate with victims of sexual assault about the status oftheir criminal cases. \nThe lack of information also deprives Missoula Police detectives of an important soun;e uf \ninformation about how they can improve their investigative techniques to collect the type of \nevidence the County Attorney's Office deems sufficient or to otherwise assist MCAO attorneys \nin developing cases for prosecution.  The failure to provide material information to the Missoula \nPolice falls far short of meeting a prosecutor's responsibility to provide information to police to \naid them in performing their duties.23 \n22 Of course, in some cases, a prosecutor may have good reasons to exercise discretion not to charge a particular \ncase,  Under the usual circumstances for conducting an investigation such as this one, we would have met with the \nrelevant agency to discuss specific decisions made; but as noted, the County Attorney has refused to cooperate with \nthis investigation. \n23 National standards for prosecutors recognize the importance of maintaining clear lines of communication between \nprosecutors and police. These standards state that the chief prosecutor, here the Cmmly Attorney, \"should actively \nseek to improve communications between his Of her office and other law enforcement agencies,\" and \"should keep \nlocal1aw enforcement agencies informed of cases in which they were involved and provide information on those \ncases in order to aid law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties.\" Na!'l Dist. At!'ys Ass'n, National \nProsecution Standards Pt. II §§ 2-5.1 to 2-5.2, at 22 (3d rev. 2009).  Our expert also observed that the County \nAttorney's Office's practices in this area were significantly out of step both with national standards for prosecutors \nand with the common practice of prosecutors' offices across the nation. \n16 \n\n4.  The Practices of the County Attorney's Office Depart from Procedures \nCommonly Used by Prosecutors Across the Nation and Further Indicate Bias \nToward Victims of Sexual Assault \na.  The County Attorney's Office Fails to Adequately Investigate Sexual \nAssault Crimes or Communicate with Law Enforcement Partners to \nAid in Their Development of Sexual Assault Cases \nOur investigation to date indicates that the County Attorney's Office fails to adequately \ninvestigate cases of sexual assault, cf. Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267 (\"Departures from the \nnonnal procedural sequence also might afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a \nrole.\"); fails to collaborate with Missoula Police detectives to develop evidence, especially \nevidence of incapacitation, sufficient to support sexual assault charges; fails to engage in any \nindependent investigative responsibility; and, where additional evidence could be gathered, fails \nto explain adequately to the Missoula Police why cases are declined.  Our expert found that the \nMCAO's practices concerning sexual assault depart from the standards of other prosecutors' \noffices, indicating bias. \nWe also found that the County Attorney's Office fails to develop, or work with Missoula \nPolice detectives to develop, the evidence necessary to make non-stranger sexual assault cases \ninto viable prosecutions, particularly in cases involving drug- or alcohol-facilitated sexual \nassault.  Under Montana law, a victim who is incapacitated is incapable of consent.  See Mont. \nCode Ann. § 45-5-501(l)(a) (2013) (defining \"without consent\" to include an incapacitated \nvictim).  During our investigation, we examined several cases in which Missoula Police \ndetectives did not attempt to develop evidence of incapacitation where the other evidence \nstrongly suggested that incapacitation was relevant to establishing the woman's lack of \n24 \nconsent. The Missoula Police then referred these cases to the County Attorney's Office for \nreview.  Prosecutors, however, did nothing to ensure the Missoula Police lmew what additional \n25 \nevidence they would need in order to build legally sound prosecutions from these cases.\nIn addition, our investigation revealed that the practices of the County Attorney's Office \ndepart from the standards of respected professional associations.  While police departments \nundertake the majority of criminal investigations, national standards for prosecutors recognize \nthat the investigation of crimes, both independently and through oversight of police investigators, \nis one of the core functions and duties of a prosecutor's office.  The American Bar Association \nStandards provide that while \"[a] prosecutor ordinarily relies on police ... for investigation, ... \nthe prosecutor has an affinnative responsibility to investigate suspected illegal activity when it is \nnot adequately dealt with by other agencies.,,26 \n24 We discuss these cases in more detail in our May IS, 2013 letter to Mayor John Engen regarding the Missoula \nPolice. That letter is available at:  http://www .. iustice.gov/crtlaboutlsplldocuments/missoulapdfmd_ 5-15-13 .pdf. \n25 See, e.g., Teresa P. Scalzo, Prosecuting Alcohol-Facilitated Sexual Assault, at 17-19 Nat'l Dis!. Attorney's Ass'n \n(Aug. 2007) (discussing categories of corroborating evidence and providing numerous examples). \n26 See Amer. Bar Ass'n, Prosecutorial Function Standard § 3-3.1(0). \n17 \n\nSimilarly, the NDAA standards note that \"there are times when the prosecutor must use \nhis or her authority to initiate or continue an investigation,\" and states that \"[a] prosecutor should \nhave the discretionary authority to initiate investigations of criminal activity in his or her \njurisdiction.,,27 These situations may include cases where the primary investigative law \nenforcement agency has a conflict of interest; where the investigation has been handled \n28 \nimproperly; or where the investigation calls for expertise available at the prosecutor's office. It \nis in keeping with national standards for prosecutors' offices for prosecutors to work \ncollaboratively with police departments to develop or corroborate evidence, and to follow \nadditional investigative leads. \nMoreover, both the ABA and the NDAA recognize that prosecutors should employ \ninvestigators to supplement law enforcement investigations and, in limited circumstances, \nconduct independent investigations.  See ABA Prosecutorial Function Standard § 3-2.4(b) \n(\"Funds should be provided to the prosecutor for the employment of a regular staff of \nprofessional investigative personnel and other necessary supporting personnel, under the \nprosecutor's direct control ....\" ); NDAA National Prosecution Standard § 3-1.6 (\"Chief \nprosecutors should employ properly trained investigators to assist with case preparation, \nsupplement law enforcement investigations, [and] conduct original investigations ....\" ).  Our \nexpert has stated that it is quite common for prosecutors to employ their own investigators. \nThe NDAA further recognizes that prosecutors have a responsibility to provide oversight \nand training to police investigators.  See NDAA National Prosecution Standard § 2-5.3 (\"The \nchief prosecutor should encourage, cooperate with and, where possible, assist in law enforcement \ntraining.\").  In its guidance on prosecution of alcohol-facilitat~d s~xuaI assault, for example, the \nNDAA recommends that prosecutors \"instruct investigators to look for evidence that not only \nproves the act occurred, but also evidence that overcomes the consent defense\" and \"train police \nto conduct offender-focused investigations in rape cases.,,29 \nWe recognize that it is primarily the responsibility ofthe police to conduct investigations. \nBut it is the responsibility of the prosecutor to work with the police to ensure that investigations \nare sufficient to support viable prosecutions.  The County Attorney's Office falls short of this \nduty when it comes to crimes of sexual assault.  By ignoring its role in the investigation of \ncrimes of sexual assault, the County Attorney's Office substantially departs from national \nstandards for prosecutors and common prosecutorial practices across the nation. \nb.  The County Attorney's Office Fails to Offer Prosecutors Traiuing \nthat Would Facilitate Their Proper Handling of Sexual Assault Cases \nDespite its location in a college town, and widespread community attention to the issue of \nsexual assault, the evidence we gathered to date indicates that the County Attorney's Office has \nfailed to provide attorneys with sufficient training on prosecuting sexual assault against women, \n27 Nat'! Dist. Att'ys Ass'n cmt. § 3-1; Na!,1 Dist. Att'ys Ass'n, Na!,1 Prosecution Standards § 3-1.2 (3d ed. 2009). \n28 Na!,1 Dist. At!'ys Ass'n cmt. § 3-1. \n29 Teresa P. Scalzo, Prosecuting Alcohol-Facilitated Sexual Assault, Na!,1 Dist. Atl'ys Ass'n (Aug. 2007), \nhttp://www.ndaa.org/pdflpubyrosecutinLalcoholjacilitated_  sexual_assault. pdf. \n18 \n\nand especially non-stranger assaults.  Indeed, prior to the initiation of our investigation, the \nCounty Attorney's Office provided little, if any, such training.  Without training, prosecutors do \nnot have the tools to build strong prosecutions of non-stranger sexual assault, and thus they are \nmore likely to erroneously assess the strength of a case and rely on personal misperceptions or \nbias in exercising prosecutorial discretion in charging decisions. \nSpecifically, MCAO attorneys lack sufficient training in the bodies oflegal and scientific \nknowledge necessary to prosecute assaults against adult women, including non-stranger sexual \nassault.  While Deputy County Attorneys have attended trainings concerning domestic violence \nand the sexual abuse of children, our investigation indicates that until recently, they received no \ntraining on sexual assault. \nThe successful prosecution of sexual assault, like that for most offenses, relies on a grasp \nof relevant legal and scientific knowledge.  An attorney would struggle to prosecute a homicide \ncase that turned on DNA evidence without being familiar with the underlying science, and the \nsame is true of sexual assault cases and the science relevant to sexual assault.  As the NDAA \nexplains in its monograph on \"Victim's Responses to Sexual Assault,\" it is \"imperative for state \nand local prosecutors to be aware of rape myths and how juries may be influenced by these \nmyths\"; to be educated about the various physical and psychological responses that a woman \nmay have following sexual assault; to be able to persuasively describe to a jury how and why a \nsexual assault victim may not have expressed her lack of consent in a way that meets the jury's \nexpectations of a response to a violent crime; or to explain why a victim may not be able to recall \n3o \nor describe the details of her sexual assault. This means that, in cases involving sexual assault, \nthe prosecutor should be familiar with core concepts such as tonic iImnobility, counterintuitive \nresponse to sexual assault, the interrelationship between psychological trauma and memory, and \nmeans of addressing misinformation about violence and sex.3l \nThe County Attorney's Office's inadequate training impacts both charging decisions and \nthe ability to successfully prosecute sexual assault.  For instance, under Montana law, the sexual \nhistory of a woman is legally protected from introduction at trial in sexual assault cases in all but \nthe most limited circumstances.32  Yet one woman informed us that the County Attorney's Office \nstated that MCAO had declined to prosecute her case because of her sexual history.  Basing \nprosecutorial decisions on women's sexual histories not only demoralizes and stigmatizes \n30 Patricia L.

Ann. § 45-5-511. \n19 \n\nvictims, it disregards laws and national prosecutorial standards designed to sexual assault \nprosecution and protect women who report assaults. \nAccording to recent correspondence we have received from you, two Deputy County \nAttorneys attended a weeklong sexual assault prosecution training session conducted by the \nNational District Attorneys Association in August 2013.  Since the announcement of our \ninvestigation and in particular since the issuance of the findings letters and the entry of \nagreements with MPD and OPS, several prosecutors have attended the training provided to MPD \nand OPS investigators and first responders as part of the DOJ settlement agreements.  This is a \nwelcome development.  Under the agreements with the Missoula Police and the University, there \nhave been· several required training sessions for local law enforcement, and it is our \nunderstanding that Deputy County Attorneys have attended these trainings. \nWhile this increased attention to training is important, it is not enough.  As national \nstandards from the NDAA and the ABA indicate, training must be targeted to the function of the \nprosecutor, address the dynamics of working with victims and developing the evidence for a \nsuccessful prosecution, and be ongoing. \nWe believe the commonsense remedies we have proposed to you over the last several \nmonths will help augment the trainings you have instituted by providing additional tools to \nprepare Missoula prosecutors to respond appropriately, respectfully and fairly to victims of \nsexual assault, as well as work with other law enforcement and victims to identify and develop \nthe evidence necessary for successful prosecutions. \nCONCLUSION \nDiscrimination, including gender bias and stereotypes, undennines law enforcement's \nability to effectively vindicate the rights of sexual assault victims and hold perpetrators \naccountable, and weakens public confidence in the criminal justice system.  The United States \nhas worked cooperatively with the University of Montana and the Missoula Police Department to \ndevelop durable and comprehensive remedies that better protect women and make law \nenforcement more effective.  We urge you to join us in these collaborative efforts.  We stand \nready to meet with you to discuss a mutually agreeable and prompt resolution of this matter. \nPlease note that this letter is a public document and will be posted on the Civil Rights \nDivision's website.

      "title": "DOJ Press Release: Justice Department Announces Missoula Police Department Has Fully Implemented Agreement to Improve Response to Reports of Sexual Assault",
      "text": "Department of Justice \nOffice of Public Affairs \n \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \nMonday, May 11, 2015 \nJustice Department Announces Missoula Police \nDepartment Has Fully Implemented Agreement to \nImprove Response to Reports of Sexual Assault \nThe Department of Justice announced today that the Missoula, Montana, Police Department (MPD) has \nfully implemented the requirements of its agreement with the department to improve the MPD’s response \nto reports of sexual assault.  The agreement, which was entered into in May 2013, resolved part of the \ndepartment’s comprehensive investigation of the response by the Missoula criminal justice system and the \nUniversity of Montana to sexual assault.  Thomas R. Tremblay, the independent reviewer who determines \nwhether the terms of the agreement have been met, has determined, and the department has agreed, that \nthe MPD has met all of its obligations under the agreement and achieved the overall purpose of the \nagreement.  \nThe purpose of the agreement between the department and the MPD was to better protect and vindicate \nthe rights of sexual assault victims by transforming the MPD’s response to allegations of sexual \nassault.  To do this, the agreement required significant changes to the police department’s policies, \npractices and supervision.  These changes promote more reliable sexual assault investigations, and \neffective, nondiscriminatory law enforcement and community support for victims, the police department \nand its officers.  The MPD’s implementation of the agreement has resulted in a host of historic advances \nin the Missoula response to sexual assault, including the following: \n•! creation of a new Special Victims’ Unit in the MPD focusing on sex crimes cases, and an interview \nroom specifically designed for interviews with victims of sexual assault; \n•! extensive specialized training for first responders and detectives in the response to sexual assault; \n•! development and institution of an external review panel – one of the first of its kind – to review \nclosed sexual assault cases for investigative comprehensiveness and indications of gender bias; \n•! completion of an audit of the community-wide response to sexual assault – one of the first \ncommunity audits to focus exclusively on sexual assault – including all of the key law enforcement \nagencies, advocacy organizations and medical service providers serving victims of sexual assault \nin Missoula County; \n•! community advocates reporting better communication and coordination with local law \nenforcement than ever before; and \n•! victim surveys indicating significant satisfaction with police officers’ and detectives’ treatment of \nvictims reporting sexual assault to law enforcement. \n“Our agreement with the Missoula Police Department following our investigation into the handling of \nsexual assault complaints made by women in Missoula has been a catalyst for powerful changes in both \nthe law enforcement and the community’s coordinated response to sexual assault,” said Principal Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division.  “We are grateful for the efforts of \nMPD and the entire Missoula community because, as a result of these reforms, the women of Missoula are \nsafer, more trusting of the criminal justice system, and subject to more fair and respectful treatment by \nlocal law enforcement.  Missoula’s police department had the courage and leadership to acknowledge that \n\nit had a problem and to address it, and as a result, is poised to become a model for communities \nstruggling with these issues around the country.” \n“We commend the Missoula Police Department and the city of Missoula for the leadership and \ncommitment that they have demonstrated to transform the way in which their city police department \nresponds to reports of sexual assault,” said U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter of the District of Montana.  “We \nalso recognize and appreciate the hard work that the detectives and officers of the Missoula Police \nDepartment have put into carrying out these reforms.  In so doing, they have carried out the highest ideals \nof public service, making the safety and civil rights of their community a top priority, and their efforts \nshould be an inspiration to us all.”  \nThe full implementation of the department’s agreement with the MPD marks the first completion of the \nseries of agreements stemming from the department’s multi-pronged investigation, launched in May \n2012, regarding the handling of sexual assault complaints made by women in Missoula.  The \ninvestigation, conducted under the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement act of 1994, the Safe Streets Act, \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, evaluated the \nresponse to sexual assault at the University of Montana at Missoula, the University of Montana Police \nDepartment (UMPD), the MPD, and the Missoula County Attorney’s Office.  The department entered into \nagreements with the university, the UMPD and the MPD in May 2013, to resolve findings related to those \nparties and address deficiencies in their response to sexual assaults.  The department, together with the \nMontana Attorney General’s Office, entered into agreements regarding the Missoula County Attorney’s \nOffice the following year, in June 2014.  The implementation of those agreements has already improved \nthese parties’ response to sexual assaults. \nThese agreements, as well as a description of the department’s work regarding sexual assault in Missoula, \nare available at: http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/.  The independent reviewer’s final compliance \nreport, describing in detail his determination that the MPD has successfully implemented the \ndepartment’s agreement, is forthcoming, and will be available on the department’s website upon its \nrelease. \n!",

Those allegations are false, \nunfounded, and the defendants have exceeded their statutory and \nconstitutional authority. Nevertheless, the defendants continue to impose \ncostly and unnecessary demands on the County Attorney and the citizens of \nMissoula County.  \nPARTIES \n1.  Fred Van Valkenburg is the County Attorney for Missoula County, \nMontana (“County Attorney”). The County Attorney serves as the publicly-\nelected legal advisor for the County and is responsible for prosecuting \n2 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 3 of 19\n \ncriminal matters within the County. The County Attorney’s specific duties are \ncodified at Montana Code Annotated §§ 7–4–2701 to 7–4–2717.  \n2.  The County Attorney’s Office for Missoula County, Montana, \n(“County Attorney’s Office”) is a political subdivision of Missoula County, \nMontana. The County Attorney’s Office assists the County Attorney in \ncarrying out his statutory duties.  \n3.  The U.S. Department of Justice is the United States federal \nexecutive department responsible for the enforcement of law and \nadministration of justice. Eric H. Holder, Jr., named here in his official \ncapacity, is Attorney General of the United States. Michael W. Cotter, named \nhere in his official capacity, is the United States Attorney for the District of \nMontana. Jocelyn Samuels, named here in her official capacity, is Acting \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General for the United States Department of \nJustice’s Civil Rights Division. Jonathan M. Smith, named here in his official \ncapacity, is Chief of the Special Litigation Section for the United States \nDepartment of Justice’s Civil Rights Division; and John Does 1–10, in their \nofficial capacities are officials with the United States Department of Justice \nwhose identities are currently unknown to the plaintiffs.  \nJURISDICTION \n4.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause the plaintiffs’ claims arise under federal law. \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 4 of 19\n \n5.   The Court has jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment under \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 because this case involves an “actual controversy” within the \nCourt’s jurisdiction. \n6.  Sovereign immunity does not bar this lawsuit against the United \nStates Department of Justice because the plaintiffs are seeking nonmonetary \nrelief. See 5 U.S.C. § 702; Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States,  \n870 F.2d 518 (9th Cir. 1989); but see EEOC v. Peabody W. Coal Co.,  \n610 F.3d 1070 (9th Cir. 2010). \n7.  Sovereign immunity does not bar this lawsuit against the \nindividually-named defendants because, among other reasons, the individual \ndefendants have exceeded and are threatening to further exceed their \nstatutory authority by investigating and threatening to sue the plaintiffs. See \nDugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609 (1963); Larson v. Domestic & Foreign \nCommerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682 (1949). \nBACKGROUND \n8.  In an undated letter delivered to the Missoula County Attorney \nand Missoula Board of County Commissioners on April 30, 2012,  \nthen-Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez1 and United States Attorney \nMichael Cotter announced that their offices would be commencing an \ninvestigation of the Missoula County Attorney’s Office under the Violent \n                                                           \n1 Assistant Attorney General Perez was succeeded by Acting Assistant \nAttorney General Samuels, who is named as a defendant in this case.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 5 of 19\n \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322,  \n108 Stat. 1796, see 42 U.S.C. § 14141, and the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197, see 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 3789d.  \n9.  Assistant Attorney General Perez and United States Attorney \nCotter made a public announcement of the investigation to the press on     \nMay 2, 2012.  \n10.  Assistant Attorney General Perez and United States Attorney \nCotter alleged that the investigation was the result of the County Attorney’s \nOffice’s “fail[ure] to investigate or prosecute sexual assaults against women \nbecause of their gender or in a manner that has a disparate impact on \nwomen.” \n11.  The County Attorney’s Office does not and has not discriminated \nin its prosecution of sexual assault cases, whether allegations of sexual assault \nare made by men or women.  \n12.  Over the past year-and-a-half, the County Attorney’s Office has \ncorresponded with the defendants on numerous occasions, asking them to \nidentify what evidence they have that shows the County Attorney’s Office has \ndiscriminated in its prosecution of sexual assault cases or otherwise violated \nany person’s civil rights. They have provided no evidence. \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 6 of 19\n \n13.  In this same correspondence, the County Attorney’s Office \nrepeatedly asked the defendants to articulate the basis for their authority to \ninvestigate the County Attorney’s Office under 42 U.S.C. § 3789d or  \n42 U.S.C. § 14141. They have provided no justifiable response. \n14.  The defendants’ investigation of the County Attorney’s Office is \nthe first time officials within the Department of Justice have ever investigated \na local prosecuting attorney’s office for an alleged violation of 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 14141. In addition, the plaintiffs are unaware of any investigation by officials \nwithin the Department of Justice of a local prosecuting attorney’s office for an \nalleged violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3789d. \n15.  The defendants have repeatedly demanded that the County \nAttorney provide them with confidential criminal justice information \nregarding sexual assault cases, as well as numerous other documents and \nrecords. The defendants have also demanded that the County Attorney \nrestructure his office by hiring additional staff and by adopting a variety of \ncostly and unnecessary protocols and policies.  \n16.  On December 11, 2013, the defendants hand-delivered a proposed \nsettlement agreement demanding compliance with more than 20 \nrequirements that would impose significant costs on Missoula County \ntaxpayers. The agreement’s requirements would cost Missoula County \nhundreds of thousands of dollars annually.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 7 of 19\n \n17.  The defendants informed the County Attorney that if he did not \ncomply with their investigation and demands, they would file a lawsuit \nagainst him and seek a court order compelling compliance. \n18.  The County Attorney responded to the defendants’ proposed \nsettlement agreement by indicating he would be willing to assist the Missoula \nPolice Department and the University of Montana Office of Public Safety in \nmeeting their obligations under their respective agreements with the \nDepartment of Justice, but he would not otherwise comply with the \ndefendants’ unlawful and unsupported demands.  \nSTANDING \n19.  In order for a plaintiff to have standing under the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, the plaintiff must show there exists “a case of actual \ncontroversy.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201. “Basically, the question in each case is whether \nthe facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial \ncontroversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient \nimmediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” \nMedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007) (citations and \nfootnote omitted); accord Ass’n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, \nInc., 133 S. Ct. 2107, 2115 n.3 (2013). “[W]here threatened action by \ngovernment is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 8 of 19\n \nliability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat . . . .” \nMedImmune, 549 U.S. at 128–29 (emphasis original). \n20.  Missoula County Attorney Fred Van Valkenburg and the County \nAttorney’s Office for Missoula County, Montana, have standing to bring this \naction under the Declaratory Judgment Act. There exists a “substantial \ncontroversy” because the defendants have made repeated, intrusive demands \non the County Attorney and his office and continue to threaten a lawsuit if he \nand his office do not fully cooperate with the defendants’ unlawful \ninvestigation and demands. The defendants have provided no evidence to \nsupport their discrimination allegations and have failed to provide any \nsupport for their purported authority for the investigation and threatened \nlawsuit. \n21.  The controversy is of “sufficient immediacy” because the \ndefendants demanded, as recently as December 2013, that the plaintiffs \ncomply with more than 20 conditions in order to avoid litigation. The \ndefendants have repeatedly threatened to sue the plaintiffs if they do not \ncomply with the defendants’ demands.  \n22.  The County Attorney is not required “to expose himself to liability \nbefore bringing suit to challenge the basis for [that] threat.” MedImmune, 549 \nU.S. at 128–29. “[P]utting the challenger to the choice between abandoning \nhis rights or risking prosecution—is ‘a dilemma that it was the very purpose of \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 9 of 19\n \nthe Declaratory Judgment Act to ameliorate.’” Id. (quoting Abbott Labs. v. \nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 152 (1967)); see also Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452 \n(1974) (holding that a plaintiff need not risk prosecution under a statute \nbefore seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the enforceability of that \nstatute). \n23.   The defendants’ unsupported actions have resulted in a \nsignificant drain on the resources of the County Attorney’s Office—resources \nthat were already stretched thin—and have diverted precious time and money \nfrom the important duties the County Attorney’s Office is tasked to perform \nby Missoula County’s citizens.  \nCOUNT I:  DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n A.  ABSOLUTE PROSECUTORIAL IMMUNITY \n \n24.  The defendants have repeatedly asserted that they have authority \nto investigate and sue the plaintiffs for alleged civil rights violations under    \n42 U.S.C. § 14141 and 42 U.S.C. § 3789d.  \n25.  There is an actual controversy as to whether the defendants may \ninvestigate or sue the plaintiffs under the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial \nimmunity.  \n26.  The doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity bars the \ndefendants from investigating or suing the plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 \nor 42 U.S.C. § 3789d. \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 10 of 19\n \n27.  The federal common-law doctrine of “absolute prosecutorial \nimmunity” is based on “the same purpose that underlies the immunity of \njudges and grand jurors acting with the scope of their duties: to protect the \njudicial process.” Milstein v. Cooley, 257 F.3d 1004, 1007 (9th Cir. 2001) \n(citing Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 485 (1991); Imbler v. Pachtman,  \n424 U.S. 409, 422–23 (1976)). \n28.  The doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity immunizes a \nprosecuting attorney from claims that arise out of the prosecuting attorney’s \nrole as an advocate for the State. Milstein, 257 F.3d at 1008. \n29.  When Congress passes statutes—such as 42 U.S.C. § 14141 or  \n42 U.S.C. § 3789d—that might facially apply to conduct of prosecuting \nattorneys, Congress does so with “knowledge of then-existing common law \nimmunities . . . .” Id. at 1007 (citing Burns, 500 U.S. at 484; Imbler,  \n424 U.S. at 418; Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 376 (1951)). “[T]he lack \nof an explicit abrogation of these immunities has been interpreted as \npreserving them.” Id. (citing Burns, 500 U.S. at 484; Imbler, 424 U.S. at 418; \nTenney, 341 U.S. at 376). \n30.  Congress did not abrogate absolute prosecutorial immunity in \npassing either 42 U.S.C. § 14141 or 42 U.S.C. § 3789d.  \n31.  The United States Supreme Court and the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit have both held “a prosecutor has absolute \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 11 of 19\n \nimmunity for the decision to prosecute a particular case and for the decision \nnot to prosecute a particular group of cases.” Botello v. Gammick,  \n413 F.3d 971, 976 (9th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted, citing Burns, 500 U.S. at \n486); see also Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 555 U.S. 335, 344–48 (2009) \n(holding that absolute prosecutorial immunity also applies to administrative \nfunctions that are directly connected to the prosecution of a criminal case). \n32.  The Department of Justice itself frequently and successfully relies \non the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity.  When its prosecutors are \nsued for alleged civil rights violations in their prosecutions of criminal cases, \ncourts universally conclude that the prosecutors are shielded by absolute \nprosecutorial immunity. See e.g. Jones v. Yanta, 610 F. Supp. 2d 34, 42 \n(D.D.C. 2009) (citing cases); Moore v. Motz, 437 F. Supp. 2d 88, 92 (D.D.C. \n2006); Darwich v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 13–CV–10757–DT,  \n2013 WL 5775392, at *4 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 25, 2013); Deleston v. U.S. Dep't of \nJustice, 6:10–444–DCN–WMC, 2010 WL 6872294, at *3 (D.S.C. Mar. 15, \n2010). The Department successfully asserts this defense even when its \nprosecutors are alleged to have unconstitutionally concealed exculpatory \nevidence or manipulated evidence. Id. \n33.  The County Attorney’s Office does not prosecute sexual assault \ncases in a discriminatory manner. Regardless, the doctrine of absolute \n11 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 12 of 19\n \nprosecutorial immunity bars the defendants from investigating or suing the \nplaintiffs for how they prosecute a particular group of cases. See id. \n34.  The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to a declaration that the \ndoctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity bars the defendants from \ninvestigating or suing the plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 or  \n42 U.S.C. § 3789d. \n B.  42 U.S.C. § 14141 \n \n35.  Even in the absence of absolute prosecutorial immunity,  \n42 U.S.C. § 14141 does not permit investigation of or a lawsuit against the \nplaintiffs. \n36.  There is an actual controversy as to whether the defendants may \ninvestigate or sue the plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 14141.  \n37.  42 U.S.C. § 14141 provides: \nIt shall be unlawful for any go vernmental authority,  or any \nagent thereof, or any person acting on behalf of a governmental \nauthority, to engag e in a patter n or practice of conduct by law  \nenforcement officers or by officials or employees of any \ngovernmental agency with responsibility for the admin istration \nof juvenile justice or the incarceration of juveniles that deprives \npersons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected \nby the Constitution or laws of the United States. \n \n38.  The defendants have argued that 42 U.S.C. § 14141 applies to the \nplaintiffs because they are “law enforcement officers.”  \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 13 of 19\n \n39.  Prosecutors are not “law enforcement officers” within the \nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. § 14141.  \n40.  Indeed, when its own prosecutors are sued for alleged improper \nconduct, the Department successfully argues that its prosecutors are not \n“investigative or law enforcement officers,” thereby shielding them from \npotential liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act. See e.g. Tri-State Hosp. \nSupply Corp. v. United States, 142 F. Supp. 2d 93, 98 (D.D.C. 2001), reversed \non other grounds, 341 F.3d 571 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see also Trupei v. United \nStates, 304 Fed. Appx. 776 (11th Cir. 2008); Moore v. United States, 213 F.3d \n705 (D.C. Cir. 2000). \n41.  The defendants have never investigated or sued a prosecuting \nattorney’s office under 42 U.S.C. § 14141. \n42.  The legislative history of 42 U.S.C. § 14141 shows that it was \nintended to apply to police departments or sheriff’s departments but not a \nprosecuting attorney’s office.  \n43.  The United States Department of Justice has consistently \ninterpreted 42 U.S.C. § 14141 as applying only to police departments or \nsheriff’s departments.  \n44.  Since the plaintiffs are not “law enforcement officers” in the \ncontext of 42 U.S.C. § 14141, the defendants do not have the authority to \n13 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 14 of 19\n \ninvestigate or sue the plaintiffs, or any local prosecutor, under 42 U.S.C.  \n§ 14141. \n45.  The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to a declaration that  \n42 U.S.C. § 14141 does not provide the defendants with authority to \ninvestigate or sue the plaintiffs. \n C.  42 U.S.C. § 3789d \n \n46.  Even in the absence of absolute prosecutorial immunity,  \n42 U.S.C. § 3789d does not permit investigation of or a lawsuit against the \nplaintiffs.  \n47.  There is an actual controversy as to whether the defendants may \ninvestigate or sue the plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 3789d. \n48.  42 U.S.C. § 3789d prohibits “discrimination . . . in connection with \nany programs or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available \nunder [Title 42, Chapter 46].” 42 U.S.C. § 3789d(c)(1). \n49.  42 U.S.C. § 3789d further states: “Nothing in this chapter or any \nother Act shall be construed to authorize any department, agency, officer, or \nemployee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or \ncontrol over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State \nor any political subdivision thereof.” 42 U.S.C. § 3789d(a). \n50.  The defendants nevertheless allege they have authority to \ninvestigate, sue, and impose requirements on the County Attorney and his \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 15 of 19\n \noffice under 42 U.S.C. § 3789d because the County Attorney’s Office has \nreceived federal funds. \n51.  The plaintiffs have not received any funds under Title 42, Chapter \n46 for prosecution of sexual assault cases. During the time period relevant to \nthis complaint, Missoula County received federal funding from a $200,000 \ngrant related to veteran mental health and substance abuse concerns. The \nplaintiffs did not receive any of the funds made available from this grant. The \nplaintiffs were awarded a federal grant of $7,000 aimed at juvenile \ndelinquency titled “JDAI (Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative) & \nJuvenile System Improvement.” The plaintiffs did not receive any of the funds \nmade available from this grant but only administered the grant. Finally, the \nplaintiffs received $19,757 of federal funding as a sub-grantee of a larger grant \nawarded to the Missoula County Sheriff, which was used to fund a drug-\ncrimes paralegal position. None of the funds made available from this sub-\ngrant were spent in any manner for the prosecution of sexual assault cases.  \n52.  The defendants have not shown whether any federal grant was \nawarded to the County Attorney’s Office under Title 42, Chapter 46, which is a \nprerequisite for the enforcement of 42 U.S.C. § 3789d.  \n53.  Even assuming the grants were awarded under Title 42, Chapter \n46, the defendants do not have the authority to investigate or sue the \nplaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 3789d because that statute applies only to \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 16 of 19\n \n“discrimination . . . in connection with any programs or activity funded in \nwhole or in part with funds made available under [Title 42, Chapter 46].” \n(emphasis added). \n54.  There is no connection with the discrimination alleged by the \ndefendants and any federal funds the plaintiffs have received. The alleged \ndiscrimination involves the prosecution of sexual assault cases, but the \nalleged federal funding relates to veteran mental health and substance abuse, \njuvenile delinquency, and drug crimes.  \n55.  Since the alleged discrimination has no connection with federal \nfunds that the plaintiffs have received, the defendants do not have the \nauthority to investigate or sue the plaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 3789d.  \n56.  The defendants’ actions are unlawful attempts to “exercise . . . \ndirection, supervision, or control over” the County Attorney and his office.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 3789d(a). \n57.  Further, the defendants have failed to comply with the notice and \nprocedural requirements of 28 C.F.R. Part 42, Subpart D. \n58.  The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to a declaration that  \n42 U.S.C. § 3789d does not provide the defendants with authority to \ninvestigate or sue the plaintiffs. \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 17 of 19\n \nD. U NITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n59.  The Constitution “divides power among sovereigns and among \nbranches of government precisely so that we may resist the temptation to \nconcentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the \nday.” New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 187 (1992). “The Federal \nGovernment may neither issue directives requiring the States to address \nparticular problems, nor command the States’ officers, or those of their \npolitical subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. \nIt matters not whether policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case \nweighing of the burdens or benefits is necessary; such commands are \nfundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual \nsovereignty.”  Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997). \n60.  There is an actual controversy as to whether the defendants may \ninvestigate or sue the plaintiffs under the United States Constitution.  \n61.  The defendants have levied unsupported allegations of \nunconstitutional conduct and have exceeded their own jurisdiction in an \nattempt to unconstitutionally commandeer an elected local official, the \nCounty Attorney, into implementing a federal program for handling sexual \nassault cases. \n62.  As applied to the plaintiffs, the defendants’ invocation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 14141 and 42 U.S.C. § 3789d violates the Tenth Amendment.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 18 of 19\n \n63.  The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to a declaration that the \ndefendants are barred from investigating or suing the plaintiffs under the \nUnited States Constitution.  \nCOUNT II:  ATTORNEY’S FEES \n64.  28 U.S.C. § 2202 provides the Court with discretion to award \nattorney’s fees, costs, and expenses to the prevailing party in a declaratory \njudgment action. The plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court award the \nplaintiffs their attorney’s fees, costs, and expense. \nDEMAND FOR RELIEF \n  For the reasons above, Fred Van Valkenburg, County Attorney for the \nCounty of Missoula, Montana, and the County Attorney’s Office for Missoula \nCounty, Montana, respectfully request the Court declare that the defendants \nhave no authority to investigate, issue findings, or sue the Missoula County \nAttorney or his office, under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 or 42 U.S.C. § 3789d for alleged \ndiscrimination in how the County Attorney or his office handle and prosecute \ncriminal cases because: \na.  the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity bars the defendants \nfrom investigating or suing the County Attorney or his office, \n \nb. 42 U.S.C. § 14141 does not provide the defendants with authority to \ninvestigate or sue the County Attorney or his office, \n \nc.  42 U.S.C. § 3789d does not provide the defendants with authority to \ninvestigate or sue the County Attorney or his office, and \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 9:14-cv-00038-DLC   Document 1   Filed 02/11/14   Page 19 of 19\n \nd. the United States Constitution bars the defendants from investigating or \nsuing the County Attorney or his office. \n \n  The plaintiffs also request that the Court award the plaintiffs their \nreasonable attorney’s fees and any other equitable relief that the Court deems \njust. \n  Dated this 11th day of February 2014. \n \n      /s/  Natasha Prinzing Jones                                     \n            Natasha Prinzing Jones \n            Thomas J.

Mazurek  Building  \nAttorney  General   215  North Sanders  \nP.O.  Box  201401  \nHelena,  MT  59620-1401  \nAN INTRODUCTION FROM TIM FOX, \n ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MONTANA \nOn  June 10, 2014, I signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)1  with Missoula County, the  \nMissoula County Attorney’s Office (MCAO), and the United States Department of Justice \n(USDOJ) resolving USDOJ’s investigation of the MCAO’s handling of sex assault prosecutions.  \nThis MOU outlined a cooperative agreement between the Montana Attorney General’s Office \n(MT AGO) and the MCAO to ensure the success of the MCAO’s efforts to improve its response \nto sexual assault.  My office provided the first report to the USDOJ in December 2014 and we \nhave since published four quarterly reports for the periods ending in January, March, June and \nSeptember of 2015. These reports are available here: https://dojmt.gov/agooffice/missoula-\ncounty-agreement  \nThis document represents the final Quarterly report that will be prepared by our office pursuant to \nthe agreements, but work on these agreements will continue through June, 2016. The MCAO will \ncontinue to collect and provide data to the MT AGO through June 2016 as set forth in Section \nG(2)(e) of the MOU between US DOJ, MT AGO, and MCAO.  The parties have also agreed to \nbegin working with the MCAO, the USDOJ and our Technical Advisor, Anne Munch to provide \n1  This  and  the other  MOUs  are attached  to  the First Quarterly  Report, available here at https://dojmt.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Quarterly-Report-January-2015.pdf. \n3  \n\nthe public with a final reflection on this extraordinary effort, to be published after June, 2016, \nwhen all obligations under the agreements are scheduled to be complete. \nFor now we should take a moment to celebrate the accomplishments that the MCAO has achieved \nthrough cooperation with all the parties to the agreements. The MCAO has made dramatic \nimprovements in their pace of prosecution, services to victims, and administrative structure in \nhandling these cases.  The MCAO, along with their colleagues in the Missoula Community are \ntruly a model we can all look to in how to better bring justice to victims of this terrible crime. \nWhile we celebrate these accomplishments, we also must not forget that there is always more that \ncan be done. It remains true that most victims of sexual assault never come forward and even those \nwho do, many do not want to participate in prosecutions.  I see the work done under these \nagreements not as a finish line, but as a starting point for further improvements in handling of sex \nassault cases all around our great state. This is why my office is currently working with \nstakeholders from Missoula and all around Montana on a number of initiatives, including proposed \nlegislative improvements to our statutory definitions of \"consent\" and a pilot training to be held in \nHelena, MT on May 24 through 25 to provide best practices to attendees and a strategic plan to \nimprove sex assault prosecutions within the Helena community. \nWith these and many other efforts to follow, we look forward to continuing to work tirelessly to \nbring justice to all victims of sexual violence. \n4 \n\nWORK CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THE MOU’S IN THE REPORTING \n\n\nPERIOD  –  September 9, 2015  through  January 31,  2016  \n \n  On September 17 and 18, 2015,  Ole Olson of  the MT AGO’s Prosecution Services \nBureau  (PSB)  and Technical Advisor Anne Munch  (TA)  visited the Missoula County Attorney’s \nOffice.  Over the two-day  period they conducted on site reviews and  in person interviews with  \nattorneys with regard to  the  declined cases  and other cases requested to be reviewed during the \nprior reporting period.  They  also  facilitated the formation of the Montana  Multi-Disciplinary  \nTraining Team  on Sex Assault, and attended the weekly Special Victims Unit meeting.  \nAdditionally, Anne Munch and local Missoula Police Detective Brad Waln conducted a two-\nhour training  with the Missoula County Sheriff’s Detectives on best practices for  conducting sex  \nassault investigations.   \nOn February 1, 2016, the MCAO  provided the  MT AGO  with the data described in the  \nMonitoring and Compliance Plan, including  a list of training  and the updated Sexual  Assault  \nCase Data Forms.  Having reviewed these materials, the MT AGO, TA  and MCAO  discussed  the \nreporting points outlined in the Monitoring and Compliance plan.  The MT AGO  followed up \nwith specific queries on several particular cases.  Additionally, the MT AGO followed up on \nspecific points that the TA  had raised in her letter which accompanied  the June  2015 Quarterly  \nReport.  \nMOU COMPLIANCE UPDATES  \n \nThe following is a summary of the updates provided by the MCAO to the  MT AGO  in order \nof the subject topics provided in the Monitoring and Compliance Plan.  \n \n         I.

As with the previous  surveys, this survey  was  conducted by  \nthe victim  witness coordinator by telephone with the victim.  The feedback was once  \nagain positive.  The victim responded that the prosecutor “made  sentencing so much \nmore comforting than I  ever could have imagined.”     She also stated “I have nothing  \nbut great things to say  about the Missoula County  Attorney’s Office  and am so \ngrateful that Jen Clark stayed by my side the whole way.”   The complete  survey is  \nattached as  Exhibit  1.  \n \nVII.

MPD has expressed that her presence in their SVU has continued to be \ntremendously valuable in assisting detectives in their investigations and in preparing  \ncases for charging.  \n \t \t  On January 8, 2016, Missoula Police Chief Mike Brady sent County Attorney  Kirsten \nPabst a letter praising the County Attorney’s Office in general and Jordan Kilby, \nJason Marks and Kirsten Pabst in particular for their recent work with the police  \ndepartment on major cases.  Chief Brady wrote,  \n“We  would also like  to emphasize the importance  of having Ms. Kilby’s presence  \nwithin our Detective  Division. . . [H]er presence  cannot be  overstated [because  \nof]   the  good  work   and   assistance   she  provides  to  our  investigators.”     He  \ncontinued, “Thank  you to your and your office  for their assistance.  We  look \nforward to maintaining the great working relationships we have established.”    \n \n \nVIII.\t \t             Status update on MCAO involvement with law enforcement and community \npartners and update on community education efforts:  \n \n \t \t  Suzy  Boylan has been actively participating in statewide efforts to re-write  the \n\nstatutes pertaining to sexual intercourse  without consent and sexual assault.  \n\n \t \t  The MCAO’s  individual outreach efforts this last quarter include:  \no \t \t  9/14/15 University Council on Student Assault  meeting  UM Boardroom, \nattended by Kirsten Pabst;  \no \t \t  9/17/15 Multi-Disciplinary Team  Steering Meeting UM Boardroom, with \nAG’s Office, Anne Munch, Jason  Marks, Jennifer  Clark, Suzy  Boylan, Brian  \nLowney, Jordan  Kilby, Cathy  Dorle  and Kirsten Pabst;  \no\t \t   9/18/15 Kirsten Pabst met with Anne Munch  to discuss progress to date and \nidentify remaining  gaps and ideas for continued outreach;  \n7  \n \n\no\t \t   9/28/15, 10/19/15, 11/2/15 Montana MDT Training Team on Sex Assault  \nconference, with Kirsten  Pabst, Cathy  Dorle, Jordan  Kilby, Jennifer  Clark  and \nSuzy  Boylan;  \no\t \t   9/29/15 Kirsten Pabst and Cathy  Dorle  met with the CVA staff for our \nquarterly meeting/sharing;  \no \t \t  10/8/15 Kirsten Pabst was the guest lecturer at UM Criminal Adjudication \nclass  on changes in how sexual assault cases are handled in Missoula and in \nparticular on the benefits of the integrated SVU unit;  \no \t \t  10/14/15 Kirsten  Pabst  was the guest speaker at the Sunrise Rotary Club, \ndiscussing changes in the office  and the building of our SVU;  \no \t \t  10/28/15 Jennifer  Clark  presented at the Citizen’s Law School  in part on how \nsexual assault cases are handled in Missoula;  \no \t \t  11/9 & 10/15 Not in Our  State Summit  –  Sexual Assault in Montana: Fact, \nFiction, and Future  –  Kirsten  Pabst  was a panelist; all of the Special Victim’s \nUnit attended the conference;    \no \t \t  11/19/15 Jennifer  Clark  presented a CLE at the law school on prosecuting  \nsexual assault and domestic violence cases;  \no \t \t  11/30/15 Suzy  Boylan and Jennifer Clark participated in the Montana MDT  \nTraining Team on Sex Assault, Helena meeting; and  \no \t \t  12/9/15 First Step Advisory  Board Meeting–  Jason  Marks  and Suzy  Boylan \nparticipated.  \n \n    IX.             Status of the $10,000 Expert Witness fees fund:  \n \n \t \t  The fund has been used to pay the following  experts in sexual assault cases tried this  \npast Quarter:   No cases tried in this  period.  \n \nX. \t \t     Review of all  MCAO files for all declined  sexual assault  cases since the  prior  \nQuarterly report, if any, as well as any other cases requested to be reviewed by the TA \nand MT AGO:  \n \nThere were no declined sexual assault cases between September  8, 2015 and January  \n31, 2016.   \n \n \t \t  The TA and MT AGO have  completed the  case  review process for  LE case number  \n2015-4283  which was charged and then dismissed prior to September 8, 2015, \npursuant to the victim’s request. The MT AGO and the TA reviewed the case file and \nconducted an in person meeting with the prosecuting attorney  and SVU supervisor  \nJason Marks.  This case  was an example of the struggle in balancing respect for a  \nvictim’s wishes with the need to hold offenders accountable.  Ultimately, MT AGO \nand the TA suggested to the MCAO that this was a case  where the MT AGO and TA  \n8  \n \n\nbelieved  that more  could have been done to hold the offender accountable.  The  \nMCAO maintains that it would not have been appropriate to continue prosecution of a  \nsexual assault against the wishes of the victim.  This case remains unfiled.  The  MT \nAGO  is not recommending that the MCAO reverse course  after the fact on this case  \nas victim’s request to dismiss has already been granted and reversing course at this \npoint would not be just to  either the victim or the  defendant. As a result of this \nreview, however, the MCAO and MT AGO agree  that on future cases the MCAO will  \nspecifically look for  what more can be done to engage or re-engage victims on cases \nwhere the victim is reluctant to prosecute.  The MCAO will at least consider  \nproceeding on cases against the victim’s wishes where the sexual assault case  \ndynamics of the case are  more informed by  domestic violence case as opposed to a \nsexual assault case.  \n \n\t \t   The TA and MT AGO  also conducted formal case review on LE case numbers  2015-\n1951; 2015-27095; 2015-29653; and 2015-15509.  These cases were all referred to \nthe MCAO by MPD for review.  All four  cases involved homeless victims and were  \nplaced inactive by MPD after victim discontinuation.  These cases highlighted the  \ndifficulty faced by law enforcement in completing investigations of sexual violence  \nagainst this vulnerable population.   The MT AGO and the TA reviewed the case  files  \nand conducted a telephone conference  with the prosecuting  attorney  who reviewed \nthe cases and SVU supervisor Jason Marks.    \n \n\t \t   As a result of issues identified and discussions arising out of this case  review process \nMCAO has identified a number of opportunities to try and improve outcomes on \ncases where the victim does not wish to participate or is reluctant.  The MCAO has \nengaged  a trainer from the Montana Native Women’s coalition to help the MCAO \nengage with Native Victims of sexual assault.  The MCAO  has also communicated \nwith the MPD to ensure that the MPD will contact the “on-call” SVU attorney  when \nan “off hours” rape case is reported so that appropriate guidance  can be  ensured at the  \noutset of a case.  \n \nTECHNICAL ADVISOR RECOMENDATION  UPDATES  \n \nAnne Munch  made a number of recommendations in her letter dated  June  23, 2015.  Some of  \nthese updates were  addressed in the Quarterly Report for Period ending September 8, 2015.  For \ncontinuity, the prior  updates are included here along with the updates that occurred in the current \nreporting period.   \n \nI.    Development of Policies and Guidelines for Sexual Assault Cases:  \n9  \n \n\n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that the MCAO continue to utilize the Condensed Policy and \nGuidelines for Handling Sexual Assault cases:    \no \t \t  A review of the Sex Assault Data Sheets indicates this is the case.  \n \nII. \t\t   Training for  County Attorney Supervisors and prosecutors in response to sexual \nassault:  \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended continued training for MCAO prosecutors in the areas listed in \nthe MOU as well as on additional topics such as prosecuting cases involving Native  \nAmerican Victims and Drug and Alcohol Facilitated Assault:    \no \t \t  The MCAO continues to look for training opportunities and will schedule and \nattend trainings on these  topics. The MT AGO and the MCAO  have  scheduled  a \ntraining  session on working with Native  American Victims  for the second week in \nMarch of 2016.  \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that she spend additional time with  the MCAO  developing \ntraining blocks for use in the larger  Montana community:   \no \t \t   Ms. Munch provided sample curriculum for sexual assault and domestic violence  \ntraining at the inaugural meeting of the  Montana  Multi-Disciplinary Training  \nTeam on sex assault held in September, 2015.  Development of a training  \nprogram utilizing  community partners is ongoing in conjunction with the MT \nAGO.   The members of this team include the Prosecution Services Bureau out of \nthe MT AGO, the MCAO, the MPD, Just Response, the UM PD, the crime  \nvictim’s advocacy  center, the Title IX office of the University of Montana, and \nmany others.   The team’s mission statement is as follows:  \n \nThe   mission  of   the  Montana   Multidisciplinary   Training   Team  on  Sexual  \nAssault   is  to  provide  trauma-informed  training   and  technical  assistance   to  \ncommunities  across  Montana   by   enhancing   a   coordinated,  competent, \nprofessional and consistent response by  criminal  justice  professionals with the  \ngoal  of  creating   improved  outcomes   for   victims,  increasing   offender  \naccountability, and creating safer communities.  \n \n10  \n \n\nThe training team is currently preparing to present a statewide training and  \nworkshop in Helena, Montana  to  take place on May 24 and 25 of 2016.    This \ntraining will provide best practices in law enforcement and community response  \nto sex assault, as well as a facilitated goal setting session for improving  response  \nto sex assault in the Helena Community.   \n \nIII.   Assurances to on-going practices within the Missoula County Attorney’s Office  \n \n\t \t   Ms. Munch recommended that the MCAO utilize  the victim advocate and SVU to reduce  \nthe time period between the charging decision and the first meeting with the victim:  \no\t \t   Under the administration of Missoula County Attorney Kirsten Pabst, the time \nbetween charging decision and first meeting with the victim has improved \ndramatically.  For example, in the first report, the average time between referral of \na case  and contact with victim was 35 days.  In this final reporting period, the  \naverage time between referral and contact with the victim was less than one day.  \nThis improvement is due in large part to not only a focus on this metric, but also \nthe availability of a dedicated victim advocate within the MCAO to ensure  \nimmediate contact with victims.  \n \n\t \t   Ms. Munch recommended that the MCAO continue to collect and evaluate data with \nregard to communication with victims and advocates in order to ensure long term  \nchanges:    \no\t \t   The parties to the MOUs have all agreed MCAO  will continue to collect and \nprovide data to the MT AGO through June 2016  as set forth in Section G(2)(e) of  \nthe MOU between US DOJ, MT AGO, and MCAO.  \n \n\t \t   Ms. Munch recommended that the MCAO solicit and consider feedback of victims and \ncommunity based advocates in order to ensure that her role and the  introduction  of these  \nservices to victims in the  community  are maximally effective and the  services are not \nunnecessarily duplicated:   \no\t \t    On June 29, 2015, the MCAO implemented a victim survey  that is conducted on  \neach closed  sex assault case.  These surveys are  conducted either in person or \nover the phone by the MCAO’s victim advocate on every closed sex assault case.  \n11  \n \n\nAs of this report a total of four surveys have been completed and all indicate  \npositive experiences by the victims.  Additionally, Kirsten Pabst and Cathy  Dorle \nhave been meeting with the Crime Victim Advocates on a quarterly basis, to \ndiscuss on-going positive relationships between the offices, identify  gaps in  \nservices and  reduce duplication of efforts.   \n \nMCAO reports that duplication of services has been identified and addressed \nprimarily through regular communication between the  Ms. Dorle, the community  \nadvocates, and the victims in order  to identify the needs of each victim,  given \nthat  each case/victim is different.  \n \nMCAO reports that gaps in services were identified primarily in the  area of post-\nconviction services.  Accordingly, the MCAO has directed Ms. Dorle  to provide \npost-conviction services to victims.  This has proven to be a very valuable  and \nappreciated service to victims in the community.  The victim advocate works  to \ntrack down victims to notify them of their offender's parole hearings, and assist \nthem as needed to testify  and  prepare written statements.  Ms. Dorle has  \npersonally spoken to the  Parole Board on their behalf.  Following parole hearings, \nMs. Dorle notifies  victims of the outcome, and provides  follow up information \nsuch as explaining the Dept. of Corrections programs to them, and keeping them \ninformed of the inmate's movements within the DOC, referring them to the VINE \nsystem, and other helpful/informational resources.  \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that the SVU participate in some strategic planning  with the \nSVU partners to identify the best methods for utilizing and growing prosecutorial and \ninvestigative expertise in the SVU:   \no \t \t  The MCAO is an active  member of Just Response and Just Response as a whole \nis working toward the long term goal of a  Family  Justice Center in Missoula.  \nThere  are  also ongoing  efforts within Just Response to identify  gaps in services \nand areas for improvement.   Finally, the  MPD is heading up the efforts of the  \nSVU around policies and practices and by all reports operations are  going  well.  \n \n12  \n \n\n\t  \t  Ms. Munch recommended the SVU identify  and implement a process to help SVU \nprosecutors evaluate stress levels and effectiveness on a routinely scheduled basis:  \no \t \t  MCAO supervisors are  monitoring stress levels with the understanding that SVU  \nattorneys are at a high risk for burnout.   Of particular concern is the high caseload \nbeing handled by the SVU attorneys.  Current staffing in the MCAO does not  \nallow for either a reduction in caseload or  rotation of attorneys out of the  \nSVU.   This issue will be addressed in the next budget cycle with a  request for an \nadditional attorney  as well as an enhancement to pay  for professional debriefing  \nwith a local expert on vicarious trauma associated with these cases.   \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that the SVU review MOU’s between MCAO and the law  \nenforcement partners to ensure they are being implemented and followed and whether \nthey need revision:   \no \t \t  The  MCAO reports that the MOU’s between the MCAO and the MCSO, and the \nMCAO and the MPD are  in compliance by all partners.  The MCAO  and the MT  \nAGO  would prefer for the MCSO to assign a  specific SVU detective to handle sex  \nassault cases, however,  those items are not covered in the MOU’s and it is clear  at  \nthis point that the MCSO will not accept such a term.  \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that a member of the MCSO who will be handling sex assault \ncases be identified and join the SVU as quickly as possible:   \no \t \t  The MCSO has specifically declined to designate an investigator to handle sex  \nassault cases and join the SVU.  The MCSO  chose to have sex assault cases as part \nof the general detective rotation out of a concern for investigator burnout.   There  \nis no plan to change this in the foreseeable future.  \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that supervisor review continue over a longer period of time in \norder to guarantee  forward progress and watch trends over time:   \no \t \t  The MCAO intends to have sex assault cases reviewed by the SVU supervisor  on \na permanent basis.   \n \nIV.   Improved communication with law enforcement and community partners:  \n \n13  \n \n\n\t \t   Ms. Munch recommended that the SVU participate in an on-site visit to other SVU’s \noperating in similar communities:   \no \t \t  The SVU conducted a  site visit to an SVU in Boise, Idaho  in August, 2015.   The  \nSVU has also been in phone contact with other similar units around the country.    \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that members of the SVU identify specific areas where  \nadditional training for all SVU members would be helpful to improve the quality of the  \ncases:   \no \t \t  While not directly related to the quality of any of the current cases being  \nprosecuted by the MCAO, as  noted above, MT AGO has already discussed with \nthe MCAO SVU plans for  a training on working with Native American Victims  \nwhich is planned for March.  Ms. Munch and the SVU supervisor have  also had \nsignificant conversations about the best way of  dealing with a victim’s wish to \ndecline a  case  and those conversations have served to inform the supervisor’s \nreview of cases being handled by the SVU.   Specifically, the supervisor  reviews \nfocus on what efforts have been made to engage or re-engage victims in a \nparticular case.   If possible the supervisor also likes to meet with the victim and \nthe attorney handling the case.   We  have also discussed the possibility that a  \nparticular case may  need  to be treated as a domestic violence  case where we  \nprosecute even if the victim does not wish to proceed.   \n \n\t \t   Ms. Munch recommended that the MCAO consider being a partner in the formation of a \nmulti-disciplinary training team that could provide training in other parts  of Montana:   \no\t \t   On September 17, 2015, Kirsten Pabst and all the MCAO  SVU attorneys attended \nthe facilitation meeting for the creation of the Montana Multi-Disciplinary  \nTraining Team on Sex Assault.   Over twenty members of the professional  \ncommunity attended and brainstormed ideas for the structure, funding  and \nmission of the team.  The team has applied for various grant funds and is currently  \nplanning a pilot statewide training  and workshop to take place in Helena,  MT on \nMay 25 and 26, 2016.   The plan is for additional trainings to take place in other \nparts of the state under this initiative.  MCAO staff are involved in planning and \nexecuting the multi-disciplinary training.   \n \n14  \n \n\nV. \t  \t Public Outreach and Education:  \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommended that the MCAO create a strategy for how to continue  \noutreaching to and educating the public about the improvements they are making in their \noffice in an effort to better educate and receive feedback from the public from whom they  \nserve:   \no \t \t  Kirsten Pabst has been a  regular  guest on TalkBack radio program, discussing the \nSVU, the role of the Victim Witness Coordinator, the new investigator's role and \nJordan Kilby's specialization at the MPD's SVU.  Members of the MCAO are also \ninvolved in the formation of the new Montana Multi-Disciplinary Training  Team \non Sex Assault and are contributing time and expertise to its  development.   \nSpecific outreach efforts are described in detail above.  \n \nVI. \t \t  Assessment of this Agreement and Review of Cases by the Montana Attorney \nGeneral  \n \n \t \t  Ms. Munch recommend that case reviews continue and that a more formal case review  \nprocess be identified and implemented by the MCAO  and MT AGO in order to create a \nmore consistent method for case reviews:    \no \t \t  The  MT AGO and TA have  completed their  final formal case  review  of MCAO  \nsex assault cases.  However, the MT AGO will continue to review case data  \nprovided for the remainder of the term of the agreements and MCAO will  \ncontinue its formal internal supervisor review of all sex assault cases for the  \nforeseeable future.  \nAGGREGATE DATA ANALYSIS  \n \nThe MOU between the MT AGO  and MCAO2  contemplates that the  MT AGO  will provide \nin this  quarterly  report  “an analysis of collected data from the MCAO and a report on all  \nmeasurable improvements in the response to allegations of sex assault.”  For purposes of this \nreport, the Data analyzed will include those items listed on page 3  of the MOU between the \nMCAO, MT AGO  and USDOJ,  which includes the  Aggregate Data on Sex Assault cases  from \nJune 2014 through January 31, 2016, specifically  including:  \n                                              \n2  All the MOUs  referenced  in  this  report are attached  as Exhibit to  the First Quarterly  Report, available  here at \nhttps://dojmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/Quarterly-Report-January-2015.pdf.    \n15  \n \n\n \t \t  The number of sexual assault cases referred for review by local law enforcement to \nMCAO;  \n    The number of sexual assault cases charged by MCAO;  \n    The disposition of charged sexual assault cases;  \n    The number of sexual assault cases in which additional investigation was requested of  \nlocal law enforcement;  \n    The number of victims of sexual assault who have  utilized the services of the in-house  \nvictim witness  coordinator.  \nAs a pre-requisite to gathering this Aggregate Data and as a way to monitor compliance in \nparticular cases, the MCAO  also  is providing the MT AGO  with the following case specific data  \nas outlined in the Monitoring and Compliance Plan  (See  March  2015 report, Exhibit 2):  \n \n    Copies of all Current Sex Assault Case Data Forms on all cases referred to MCAO for  \ncharging or review  since  the last Quarterly Report.  \n    Copy of the  complete files for all declined sex assault  cases, if any,  since prior Quarterly  \nreport.  \n    Data on sexual assault cases, organized by Defendant name and Case Number, which \nincludes:    \n  Referral type: review or  charging.  \n  Decision made  \n  Disposition  \n  Sentence  \n  The following dates and time spans: Date of referral, Date of  any request for \nfurther investigation; Date of prosecution decision; Date of meeting with victim;  \nDate of meeting with advocate; Date of plea offer; Date of Disposition.  \n \nThe Aggregate Data  provided by the MCAO  is presented in  attached  Exhibits 2  and 3.   \nExhibit 2  represents cases referred for a  charging  decision  from June 2014 through January 31, \n2016. Cases referred for  a charging decision are cases where law  enforcement feels it has \ncompleted investigation and that there is probable cause  to charge the case.    \nExhibit 3  represents  cases referred  from June  2014 through January 31, 2016  for  “review  \nonly.”   Cases referred for “review” are cases “where, in the eyes of the MPD detective, the \ninvestigation has not developed probable cause necessary  for arrest and prosecution.”3   The  \nassigned prosecutor reviews that investigation and either agrees with the law enforcement \ndecision to make the case inactive or refers the case back for further investigation.   \n                                              \n3  Memorandum  of  Understanding  Between  Office of  the Missoula County  Attorney’s  Office  and  the City  of  \nMissoula Police Department (Dec.  13,  2013),  at p.2.  \n16  \n \n\nWe note that the sub-categories of “cases referred for review,” which includes cases \nwhere victims declined to participate, should not be read to imply that the MPD or the MCAO or  \nthe MT AGO considers a victim’s decision to cooperate with the case  as a pre-requisite for  \nprobable cause to arrest  or sufficient evidence to charge.  Regardless of the way that these cases \nare referred to the MCAO, all the cases are subjected to the same substantive review by  a  \nprosecutor to determine  whether the case should be charged, declined, or referred for further \ninvestigation.  The victim’s decision to participate  is only one of the many factors that play into \nthe prosecutor’s decision, and does not necessarily  foreclose the possibility  of  charging the case.  \n \nI.   Comparative Analysis of Cases Referred for Charging Decisions:  \nAn analysis of the aggregate data  for cases referred for a charging decision  is provided \nbelow in Tables  1  and 2.  Table 1 is based on  data  compiled in  the first quarterly  report (June  \n2014 through November  2014).  Data gathered for the second quarterly  report  (November, 2014  \nthrough March 1, 2015)  indicates that no cases were  referred for charging  in the  reporting period \nending March 1, 2015.  Table 2 is based on the Data compiled during the reporting period  of  \nMarch 2, 2015 through June 4, 2015.    Table 3 is based on the Data compiled during the current \nreporting period of June  5, 2015 and September 8, 2015.  Table 4 is the current quarter, based on \nData compiled during the reporting period of September 9, 2015, through January 31, 2016.  \nAccording to the MCAO  Sex Assault  Manual there is no specific deadline for making  a  \ncharging decision on cases referred for prosecution or meeting  with the victim.  The manual \nstates  at pages 19 to 20 that the prosecution should make contact with the investigator  within two \nweeks of  referral and emphasizes that communications with victims is of paramount importance.   \nThe six cases reported during this period were  all charged.  The data on these cases \nillustrates a trend of improvement in  the pace of prosecution  since the June 2015 Quarterly  \nreport.

Comparative Analysis of Cases Referred for “review only”:  \nAn analysis of the aggregate data for cases referred for “review only” is provided below \nin Tables 4, 5,  6, 7 and 8.    \n    Table 4 includes data collected from June 2014 through November 2014 for the  \nfirst quarterly report.   \n    Table 5 includes all data collected from November 2014 through March 1, 2015 \nfor the second quarterly  report.   \n    Table 6 includes  all data collected from March 2, 2015 through June 4, 2015 for  \nthe third quarterly report.    \n    Table 7 includes all data collected from June 5, 2015 through September 8, 2015  \nfor the fourth quarterly report.  \n    Table 8 includes all data collected from September 9, 2015 through January  31, \n2016 for the final quarterly report.  \nThe Sex Assault Policy and Procedure Manual, at page 19 through 21, provides that cases \nreferred to MCAO  for “review only” should be reviewed by a prosecutor within one month of \nreferral.  The Current report shows a  continued decline in the review time taken on these  cases \nby the MCAO.  In the previous reporting period the average time to review a case was 5  days.  In \n20  \n \n\nthe current reporting period the average time was 4  days.  The MCAO now has been consistently  \nwithin the one month standard on all cases referred for review since March of 2015.  \n \n \n \nTable 5:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for “Review Only”    \nJune 2014 through November 25, 2014  (Exhibit 3)  \n    Average Time   Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in  \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred   Which the  \nReferral and  Investigator   Back  for   CA’s \nDecision  Further   Review is \n(Days)   Investigation   Pending  \nTotal SA Cases  16   40   12   4   0  \nReferred for        \nReview  \nSA Cases  9   41   7   2   1  \nReferred for  No   \nPC    \nSA Cases  8   40   5   35   0  \nReferred Where    \nVictim Declined \nto Participate  \n \n \n \nTable 6:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for “Review Only”  \nNovember 26, 2014 through March 1, 2015  (Exhibit 3)  \n    Average Time   Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred   Which the  \nReferral and  Investigator   Back  for   CA’s \nDecision  Further   Review is \n(Days)   investigation   Pending  \nTotal SA Cases  13   16   2   7   4  \nReferred for        \nReview    \nSA Cases  5   19   1   2   2  \nReferred for  No   \nPC  \nSA Cases  4   4   1   3   0  \nReferred Where  \nVictim  Declined \nto Participate  \n                                              \n5  The reasons  for  referring  a case back  for  further  investigations  are varied.   In  one case the CA  made contact with  \nthe victim  and  the victim  decided  to  participate.   Even  where the victim  has declined  to  participate,  the CA  will \nsometimes want to  insure the timely  collection  of  ephemeral evidence  in  the event the victim  decides to  later  \nparticipate.    \n21  \n \n\nTable 7:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for “Review Only”  \nMarch 2, 2015 through  June 4, 2015  (Exhibit 3)  \n    Average Time   Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred   Which the  \nReferral and  Investigator   Back for   CA’s \nDecision  Further   Review is \n(Days)   investigation   Pending  \nTotal SA Cases  6   19   4   2   0  \nReferred for        \nReview    \nSA Cases  3   25   1   2   0  \nReferred for  No   \nPC  \nSA Cases  4   15.25   3   1   0  \nReferred Where    \nVictim Declined \nto Participate  \n \n \n \n \nTable 7:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for “Review Only”  \nJune 5, 2015 through September 8, 2015  (Exhibit 3)  \n    Average Time   Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred   Which the  \nReferral and  Investigator   Back for   CA’s \nDecision  Further  Review is \n(Days)   investigation   Pending  \nTotal SA Cases  9   5   8   1   0  \nReferred for        \nReview  \n \nSA Cases  3   13   2   1   0  \nReferred for  No   \nPC  \n \nSA Cases  6   7   6   0   0  \nReferred Where    \nVictim Declined \nto Participate  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n22  \n \n\nTable 8:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for “Review Only”  \nSeptember 9, 2015 through January 31, 2016 (Exhibit 3)  \nAverage Time   Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred   Which the  \nReferral and  Investigator   Back for   CA’s \nDecision  Further   Review is \n(Days)   investigation   Pending  \nTotal SA Cases  15   4   13   2   0  \nReferred for  \nReview  \nSA Cases  5   4   3   2   0  \nReferred for  No  Did Gregory  \nPC   Bray  fall in this \ncategory?

This is likely due  to  the  focus on these metrics by the SVU supervisor, the addition of \nmore specialized prosecutors, the placement of  an Investigative Specialist in the MPD and the \nwork of the Victim Witness Coordinator.  The data also shows that challenges remain in these  \ncases in encouraging victims to come forward and participate in the prosecutions.  It can be  \nequally  challenging for prosecutors to balance the wishes of the victims with the need to hold \noffenders accountable.  A complete analysis of overall the successes, challenges, and further \nopportunities for improvement will be reserved for a final reflection after  June 2016.  For now, it \nsuffices to say that the MCAO is in a drastically better position to meet the challenges that these  \ncases pose and to make further strides bringing justice to victims.  \n23 \n\nThe improvements seen in this final report are a credit to Missoula County  Attorney  \nKirsten Pabst  who brought to office a spirit of cooperation and a new focus on the pace  of  \nsexual  assault prosecutions and specialized training  as part of a  broader goal of improving the \nexperience victims of sexual assault have with the  criminal justice system in Missoula.  Her \nleadership, her placement of an Investigative Specialist in the MPD, and her hiring of an in-\nhouse investigator have helped make the Missoula County Attorney’s Office SVU a model \nprogram for the state. Most importantly, credit for the improvements seen  in this report goes to \nthe prosecutors in the Missoula County Attorney’s Office  who have  shown  tremendous \ndedication to their work, their community, and to continually evaluating themselves to find ways \nto improve  the work they do  \n   \n24  \n \n\nTTThhhaaannnkkk yyyooouuu fffooorrr aaagggrrreeeeeeiiinnnggg tttooo aaannnssswwweeerrr aaa fffeeewww bbbrrriiieeefff qqquuueeessstttiiiooonnnsss...

Mazurek Building \nAttorney General  215 North Sanders \nP.O. Box 201401 \nHelena, MT 59620-1401 \nAN INTRODUCTION FROM TIM FOX, \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF MONTANA \nA little over one year ago, on June 10, 2014, I signed a memorandum ofunderstanding (MOU) \nI \nwith Missoula County, the Missoula County Attorney's Office (MCAO), and the United States \nDepartment ofJustice (USDOJ) resolving USDOJ's investigation ofthe MCAO's handling of \nsex assault prosecutions.  This MOU outlined a cooperative agreement between the Montana \nAttorney General's Office (MTAGO) and the MCAO to ensure the success ofthe MCAO's \nefforts to improve its response to sexual assault.  My office provided the first, semi-annual report \nto the USDOJ in December 2014 and we published the first quarterly report in January 2015. \nThe fITst and second quarterly reports are available here: \nhttps:/ldojmt.gol ·lagoomcelrnissoula-county-agreement \nI am now pleased to present to the public our third quarterly report covering progress and \ncompliance with the agreements through June 4, 2015.  One ofthe more notable accomplishments \nsince the second quarterly report include the MCAO's creation ofa new Investigative Specialist \nposition.  This prosecutor will be assigned to work in the MPD and to advise the MPD on \ninvestigations, subpoenas, warrants, and charging decisions in sex assault cases.  This prosecutor \nI This and the other MOUs are attached to the First Quarterly Report, available here at https:lldojmt.govIYtp­\ncontentlup!oadsIQuarter!v-Report-January-20J 5. pdf \n3 \n\nshould help increase the efficiency ofsex assault investigation and charging decisions and may \nserve as a model for other prosecution offices in Montana. \nWe are also in the initial planning stages ofdeveloping a multi-disciplinary team to work on \ndeveloping, training, and implementing best practices in sex assault investigations, prosecution, \nand victim advocacy in Montana's communities. \nFinally, we are working closely with the MCAO office to develop a more formalized process to \nreview declined cases.  This process will create documented feedback on declined cases to both \ninvestigators and prosecutors to improve both aspects of case work in future cases, where \nappropriate. \nWe have attached the letter written to our office from our technical advisor as an exhibit to this \nreport and I am pleased to hear from my staff that all her recommendations are being implemented. \nWe will update progress on her recommendations in the next report. \nI look forward to continuing cooperation with the MCAO and the USDOJ on this matter and other \nefforts to bring Montana to the forefront ofsex assault prosecutions. \n4 \n\nWORK CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THE MOU'S IN THE REPORTING \n\nPERIOD - March 2, 2015 through June 4, 2015 \n\nCOMPLIANCE UPDATES \n\nOn June 30, 2015, a representative from the MT AGO's Prosecution Services Bureau \n(PSB), met telephonically with Missoula County Attorney Kirsten Pabst, Criminal Chief Deputy \nJason Marks and Technical Advisor Anne Munch.

Having reviewed \nthese materials, the MT AGO and MCAO discussed the reporting points outlined in the \nMonitoring and Compliance plan.  The MT AGO followed up with specific queries on several \nparticular cases.  Finally, the MT AGO received a letter from the technical advisor, Anne \nMunch, dated June 23, as attached as Exhibit 4.  The letter summarizes progress on compliance \nwith the various MOUS and provides recommendations for further action.  This letter will be \nused as a guide for planning compliance work in the upcoming quarter.

The AGO is preparing feedback for the \nMPD and the MSCO on this case pursuant to a more formalized case review and \nfeedback policy to be rolled out in the coming quarter. \nAGGREGATE DATA ANALYSIS \nThe MOU between the MT AGO and MCA02 contemplates that the MT AGO will provide \nin this quarterly report \"an analysis ofcollected data from the MCAO and a report on all \nmeasurable improvements in the response to allegations of sex assault.\"  For purposes ofthis \nreport, the Data analyzed will include those items listed on page 3 ofthe MOU between the \nMCAO, MT AGO and USDOJ, which includes the Aggregate Data on Sex Assault cases from \nJune 2014 through March 1,2015, specifically including: \n• \t The number of sexual assault cases referred for review by local law enforcement to \nMCAO; \n• \t The number of sexual assault cases charged by MCAO; \n• \t The disposition ofcharged sexual assault cases; \n• \t The number of sexual assault cases in which additional investigation was requested of \nlocal law enforcement; \n• \t The number ofvictims of sexual assault who have utilized the services ofthe in-house \nvictim witness-coordinator. \nAs a pre-requisite to gathering this Aggregate Data and as a way to monitor compliance in \nparticular cases, the MCAO also is providing the MT AGO with the following case specific data \nas outlined in the Monitoring and Compliance Plan (March, 2015 report, Exhibit 2): \n• \t Copies of all Current Sex Assault Case Data Forms on all cases referred to MCAO for \ncharging or review since the last Quarterly Report. \n2 All the MODs referenced in this report are attached as Exhibit to the First Quarterly Report, available here at \nhttps:lldojmt.govlwp-contentluploadsIQuarterly-Report-January-2015. pdf. \n8 \n\n• \t Copy ofthe complete files for all declined sex assault cases, if any, since prior Quarterly \nreport. \n• \t Data on sexual assault cases, organized by Defendant name and Case Number, which \nincludes: \n• \t Referral type: review or charging. \n• \t Decision made \n• \t Disposition \n• \t Sentence \n• \t The following dates and time spans: Date ofreferral, Date of any request for \nfurther investigation; Date ofprosecution decision; Date of meeting with victim; \nDate ofmeeting with advocate; Date ofplea offer; Date ofDisposition. \nThe Aggregate Data provided by the MCAO is presented in attached Exhibits 2 and 3. \nExhibit 2 represents cases referred for a charging decision from June 2014 through March, 2015. \nCases referred for a charging decision are cases where law enforcement feels it has completed \ninvestigation and that there is probable cause to charge the case. \nExhibit 3 represents cases referred from June 2014 through June 4,2015 for \"review \nonly.\"  Cases referred for \"review\" are cases \"where, in the eyes ofthe MPD detective, the \ninvestigation has not developed probable cause necessary for arrest and prosecution.',3  The \nassigned prosecutor reviews that investigation and either agrees with the law enforcement \ndecision to make the case inactive or refers the case back for further investigation. \nWe note that the sub-categories of\"cases referred for review,\" which includes cases \nwhere victims declined to participate, should not be read to imply that the MPD or the MCAO or \nthe MT AGO considers a victim's decision to cooperate with the case as a pre-requisite for \nprobable cause to arrest or sufficient evidence to charge.  Regardless ofthe way that these cases \nare referred to the MCAO, all the cases are subjected to the same substantive review by a \nprosecutor to determine whether the case should be charged, declined, or referred for further \ninvestigation.  The victim's decision to participate is only one ofthe many factors that play into \nthe prosecutor's decision, and does not necessarily foreclose the possibility of charging the case. \nL  Comparative Analysis ofCases Referred for Charging Decisions: \nAn analysis of the aggregate data for cases referred for a charging decision is provided \n3 Memorandum of Understanding Between Office of the Missoula County Attorney's Office and the City of \nMissoula Police Department (Dec. 13,2013), at p.2. \n9 \n\nbelow in Tables 1 and 2.  Table 1 is based on data compiled in the first quarterly report (June \n2014 through November 2014).  Data gathered for the second quarterly report (November, 2014 \nthrough March 1, 2015) indicates that no cases were referred for charging in the reporting period \nending March 1,2015.  Table 2 is based on the Data compiled during the current reporting \nperiod of March 2,2015 through June 4,2015.  Three cases were referred for charging in the \ncurrent reporting period.  As of June 4,2015 none had been charged.  One has been declined for \nprosecution, one has been referred for further investigation, and the MCAO has offered a pre­\ncharge plea agreement on the third. \nAccording to the MCAO Sex Assault Manual there is no specific deadline for making a \ncharging decision on cases referred for prosecution or meeting with the victim.  The manual \nstates at pages 19 to 20 that the prosecution should make contact with the investigator within two \nweeks of referral and emphasizes that communications with victims is ofparamount importance. \nWhile the number of cases reported in this period are few, the cases that have been reported \nshow improvement in the time elapsed between referral and first contact with the victim.  The \ntime between referral and charging remains at an average of less than 30 days, and the longest \ntime between referral and charging was significantly less than this reporting period as compared \nto prior reporting period.  We expect that the charging decisions will become quicker with the \nplacement of the \"investigative specialist\" at the MPD. \nTable 1:  Analysis of Sex Assault Cases Referred for a Charging Decision \nBetween June 2014 and November 25, 2014 (Exhibit 2). \nSA Cases Referred to MCAO for Charging by MPD and  10 \nMCSO \nSA Cases Charged by MCAO  8 \nSA Cases Referred for Further Investigation by MCAO  1 \nSA Cases Declined by MCAO  1 \nSA Cases in Which Prosecutor Made Contact with  8'+ \nVictim \nAverage Time Between Referral and First Contact with  35 days \nVictim \n4 Regarding the two cases in which the victim was not contacted, one victim was unable to be reached despite \nattempts by the Detective and Crime Victim Advocate.

Table 5 includes all data collected from \nMarch 2, 2015 through June 4,2015 for this third quarterly report. \nThe Sex Assault Policy and Procedure Manual, at page 19 through 21, provides that cases \nreferred to MCAO for \"review only\" should be reviewed by a prosecutor within one month of \nreferral.  For the first quarterly report (period ending November 2014), only 6 out ofthe 16 (or \n38%) of cases referred for review were reviewed within 30 days.  For the second quarterly report \n(period ending March 1,2014),6 out of the 9 cases (or 67%) of cases were reviewed within the \n30 day window.5  For the current reporting period 6 out of 6, or 100% of the cases, were \nreviewed within the 30 day window. \nTable 3:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for \"Review Only\" \n(Exhibit 3--June 2014 through November 25, 2014) \nAverage Time  Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred  Which the \nReferral and  Investigator  Back for  CA's \nDecision  Further  Review is \n(Days)  Investigation  Pending \nTotal SA Cases  16  40  12  4  0 \nReferred for \nReview \nSA Cases  9  41  7  2  1 \nReferred for No \nPC \nSA Cases  8  40  5  3'  0 \nReferred Where \nVictim Declined \nto Participate6 \n5 At the time of the March 1, 2015 data, review was still pending in 4 cases and it is possible that subsequent data \nwill show that that review will have been completed in less than 30 days or more than 30 days. \n7 The reasons for referring a case back for further investigations are varied.  In one case the CA made contact with \nthe victim and the victim decided to participate.  Even where the victim has declined to participate, the CA will \nsometimes want to insure the timely collection of ephemeral evidence in the event the victim decides to later \nparticipate. \n12 \n\nTable 4:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for \"Review Only\" \n(E Xh O1b oI t 3 --N ovemb  er 26 , 2014 t h rougJh  M arc hI, 2015) \nAverage Time  Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred  Which the \nReferral and  Investigator  Back for  CA's \nDecision  Further  Review is \n(Days)  investigation  Pending. \nTotal SA Cases  13  16  2  7  4 \nReferred for \nReview \nSA Cases  5  19  1  2  2 \nReferred for No \nPC \nSA Cases  4  4  1  311  0 \nReferred Where \nVictim Declined \nto Participate \nTable 5:  Analysis of Sex Assault cases Referred for \"Review Only\" \n(March 2,  2015 througJh J une 4 ,2015) \nAverage Time  Cases in Which  Cases in Which  Cases in \nBetween  CA Agreed with  CA Referred  Which the \nReferral and  Investigator  Back for  CA's \nDecision  Further  Review is \n(Days)  investigation  Pending \nTotal SA Cases  6  19  4  2  0 \nReferred for \nReview \nSA Cases  3  25  1  2  0 \nReferred for No \nPC \nSA Cases  4  15.25  3  1  0 \nReferred Where \nVictim Declined \nto Participate \n8 The reasons for referring a case back for further investigations are varied.

Specifically, data from the current \nreporting period makes it clear that all cases referred for review are being reviewed within the 30 \nday deadline.  We continue to see an opportunity for improvement for quicker decision making \nand victim contact on cases referred for charging.  We expect that the MCAO's assignment of an \ninvestigative specialist will improve this metric. \n14 \n\nThank you  for agreeing to answer a few brief questions.

In addition to the listed trainings that the MCAO has provided \nor participated in to date, I provided some brief training on \"Meeting the Consent \nDefense\" and some technical assistance/training in the area ofjury selection in non­\nstranger sexual assault cases to the members of the sexual assault prosecution team \nduring my site visit May 4-7. \nRecommendations: I recommend that members of the MCAO prosecution team \ncontinue to receive training on the topics listed in this portion of the MOU in addition to \nother topics that are specifically relevant to the Missoula victims community such as \nprosecuting cases involving Native American victims or drug and alcohol facilitated \nsexual assault.  I also recommend that additional training opportunities be provided to \nthe more junior members of the team in order to enhance their abilities to prosecute \nthese complicated cases.  I also recommend that I spend additional time with the MCAO \nper their request and/or the request of the Montana Attorney General's Office (MAGO) \ndeveloping additional training blocks for use in Missoula and the larger Montana \ncommunity per the MOU as time limitations during my last site visit did not allow me to \ncomplete this task. \n3. \t Assurances as to on-going practices within the Missoula County Attorney's Office \nThere are seven bullets in the agreement under this sub topic; I will generally address \nthe ones on which I have been consulted. \n• \t In-person meetings with complaining witnesses: \nThe time between when the prosecutor makes a charging decision and the first \ncontact with the victim is improving with the addition of a 4th prosecutor to the \nprosecution team and the addition of a MCAO victim advocate. \nRecommendation: I recommend that the MCAO victim advocate be utilized to \nreduce this time period by facilitating meetings with the prosecutor and the \nvictim as quickly as possible.  The MCAO's active participation in the Special \nVictim's Unit (SVU) provides an additional opportunity for early and consistent \nmeetings with victims by MCAO staff. \n• \t Case related communication with victims and victim advocates: \nImprovements are being made in this area based on data collected thus far this \nyear and with the addition of an additional sex crimes prosecutor. \nRecommendation: I recommend that the process of collecting and evaluating \ndata with regard to communication with victims and advocates continue in order \nto ensure that this positive trend results in long term system changes. \n\n• \t Victim advocates: \nThe hiring of the MCAO victim advocate has added value to the office, the \nvictims and other victim advocates in the community.  Her involvement with the \nMCAO, the SVU and with the community is helping to bring additional \ninformation and resources to the MCAO and the victims as they step into the \nprocess of having their cases prosecuted. \nRecommendation: Because the addition of a victim advocate in the MCAO is a \nbrand new position, I recommend that the MCAO solicit and consider feedback \nof victims and community based victim advocates in order to ensure that her \nrole and the introduction of these services to victims in the community are \nmaximally effective and that services are not unnecessarily duplicated. \n• \t Utilization of specialized sexual assault prosecution expertise: \nThe addition of the fourth prosecutor to handle sexual assault cases is improving \nthe response to victims by cutting down on the amount of time between when \ncases are referred for charges and when they are accepted for filing of charges. \nThe addition also helps to lessen the work load for the other attorneys. \nRecommendation: The MCAO has committed itself to being a positive and active \npresence on the SVU, which is relatively young in its formation.  I recommend \nthat the MCAO and its more experienced prosecutors participate in some \nstrategic planning with the SVU partners to identify the best methods for \nutilizing and growing prosecutorial expertise on the SVU. \nGiven the stressful nature of this assignment, I recommend that a process be \nidentified and implemented by the MCAO to help the prosecutors in the unit \nevaluate stress levels and effectiveness on a routinely scheduled basis in order to \nassist with any vicarious trauma and other normal responses consistent with \nworking in a speCialized sex crimes unit. \n• \t Utilization of specialized sexual assault investigation expertise: \nThe MCAO has entered into MOUs with local law enforcement agencies \nincluding the Missoula County Sheriff's Office (MCSO).  The creation of the SVU is \nimproving the more consistent and timely accesses that the investigators, \nprosecutors and victim advocates have to each other during the course of the \ninvestigation and filing decision. The MPD has selected experienced \ninvestigators with special expertise to handle sexual assault cases which the \nMCAO is supportive of and has added value to the quality of cases they are \nseeing. The MCSO is not yet participating on the SVU.  The specialized services of \nthe Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) also remain available to the MCAO. \nRecommendations:  I recommend that the MCAO continue in its active role in \nthe ongoing development of the newly formed SVU started by the MPD.  Per my \nrecommendation in the previous section, I suggest that strategic planning by the \nSVU will also enhance and improve the quality of the investigations by law \nenforcement partners.  I also recommend that the MOU's which were signed by \nthe MCAO and each law enforcement agency be reviewed to determine whether \n\nthey are being implemented and followed, and whether there is any need for \nrevision of the MOUs. Finally, I recommend that the member of the MCSO who \nwill be handling the sexual assault cases be identified and join the SVU as quickly \nas possible. \n• \t Computer tracking system: Nothing to report.  If requested, I will be happy to \nreview the computer tracking system. \n• \t Supervisor Review: \nSupervisors are actively involved in the review and evaluation of sexual assault \ncases at the MCAO. \nRecommendations: The MCAO has just started doing this type of data gathering \nand analysis and thus should continue this process over a longer period of time \nin order to guarantee forward progress and to watch trends over time. \n4. \t Improved communication and coordination with law enforcement and community \npartners: \nSignificant improvements have been made with law enforcement partners as the result \nof the successful efforts per the requirements contained in the MOU. As an example, \nthe MCAO delivered a two hour training session (twice) to the Missoula County Sheriffs \nOffice on investigating sexual assault. \nThe most significant improvements can be seen as a result of the SVU formation which \nincludes an active role for law enforcement partners, prosecutors and victim advocates. \nI was able to attend one SVU weekly meeting during my visit May 4-7, and believe that \nthe SVU would benefit from refining the case review process as well as better defining \nits overall purpose and operation.  Efforts are currently underway for some members of \nthe SVU to participate in one or more site visits of other similar SVUs in order to glean \nexpertise as they continue to develop. \nRecommendations: This is an area that is ripe for strategic planning.  I recommend that \nmembers of the SVU, including MCAO attorneys, advocates and supervisors receive \nadditional technical assistance to improve and solidify the roles and responsibilities of \npeople who serve on the SVU.  If possible, I recommend that members of the MCAO be \nincluded in one or more site visits to other SVUs that are operating in similar \ncommunities. \nI also recommend that the SVU identify specific areas where additional training for all \nSVU members would be helpful to improve the quality of the cases. For example, how to \nimprove investigations and prosecutions of cases that impact specialized communities in \nMissoula such as Native Americans, victims with developmental disabilities,  alcohol and \ndrug facilitated sexual assault, interviewing suspects or other topics where additional \nexpertise could be helpful. \nAs the multi-disciplinary expertise in handling sexual assault cases continues to improve, \nI will restate my earlier recommendation that MCAO consider being a partner in the \nformation of a multi-disciplinary training team that could provide training in other parts \n\nof Montana as time allows. Someone from the University of Montana has expressed \nwillingness to seek grant funding for the training project and to assist in the formation \nof the team. The community of Missoula Montana seems to be in a good position to \nseek grant funding for this or other initiatives, to support their continued efforts in \nimproving their response to sexual assault.  I recommend that the MCAD partner with \nlaw enforcement and other community members to explore the possibility of securing \nfederal funding to support and expand on these current efforts. \n5.  Public Education and Outreach: \nIn addition to the activities listed in the report, I have provided technical assistance to \nthe MCAD on numerous occasions.  This technical assistance has mostly focused on \nproviding some examples of how to disseminate information about the MCAD role in \nsexual assault response on the web page and on visible displays in the front office, \nproviding some education in the area of sexual assault prevention and risk reduction for \nthe community, providing educational materials upon request, facilitating MCAD \ninvolvement with the Victim's Academy at the University of Montana and continuing \noutreach to community clubs and groups with information about the prosecution of \nsexual assault in Missoula. \nRecommendations:  Missoula has been continuously in the spotlight for how it has been \nimpacted by the crime of sexual assault.  Public perception about how cases are \ninvestigated and prosecuted in Missoula has been negative and many victims have \nexpressed dissatisfaction and concern over how their cases have been handled in the \ncriminal justice system.  The Safety and Accountability Audit which focused on, \"How \nDoes the Community Response to Sexual Assault Engage and Support Victims, and \nEnhance Victim Safety and Offender Accountability\" was released in the spring of 2015. \nIt lists as one of three gaps \"Societal myths and misperceptions about sexual assault are \ndeterrents to victims reporting and offenders being held accountable\".  The need for \nactive involvement with the community by members of the MCAD and its criminal \njustice partners is high.  I recommend that the MCAD create a strategy for how to \ncontinue outreaching to and educating the public about the improvements they are \nmaking in their office in an effort to both educate and receive feedback from the public \nwhom they serve. \n6.  Assessment of this Agreement and Review of Cases by the Montana Attorney General: \nMonitoring: Monitoring of the agreement is going smoothly with the creation of the \nmonitoring and compliance plan and tools previously mentioned that assist in data \ncollection by the MCAD. \nRecommendation: I recommend that monitoring ofthe cases and data continue and \nthat any areas of concern that emerge from this process be considered for training \ntopics for the prosecutors in the future. \n\nReview of Cases:  The practice of reviewing cases is rich and instructive.  I encountered \nsome difficulties reviewing declined and pending cases due to not having access to full \nreports, complete case files or victim and suspect interviews from outside of Missoula \nduring the first six months that the MOU was in place, and more recently due to a lack \nof time for reviews during a site visit to Missoula in May of 2015. Interestingly, the \nnumber of cases sent over from MPD for filing dropped significantly in the second half \nof the year (as noted in the 4th quarter report) thereby reducing the opportunity to \nreview cases.  Case reviews are an important tool in improving the quality of \nprosecutable cases as well as the outcomes of the cases themselves. \nRecommendation: I recommend that a more formal case review process be identified \nand implemented by the MCAO and MAGO in order to create a more consistent method \nfor case reviews where data and feedback can be collected and reviewed in a manner \nthat will be helpful to the MCAO.  I also recommend that this practice continue beyond \nthe first year of the MOU in order to review a sufficient number of cases over time and \nto identify and document any trends. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification from me.  It is \nindeed an honor to assist your office and the citizens of Missoula, Montana. \nAnne Munch, Esq. \n\nTechnical Advisor to the Montana Attorney General \n",
