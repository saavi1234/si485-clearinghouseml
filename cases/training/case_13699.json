The District now\nseeks to withdraw that motion.  As more fully explained below, the United States requests that the court\nhold both motions in abeyance to allow the parties to obtain information regarding the new issues raised\nby the District.  The United States believes that further review will assist the parties and the court in\ndetermining which motion should be granted.\nThe motion seeking dismissal of this longstanding school desegregation case was filed after a\nreview of the school system showing that the District had fulfilled its affirmative obligations under the\norders of this court and existing federal law.  The parties agreed it was appropriate to seek a declaration\nof unitary status and dismissal and moved this court to approve such action through a proposed agreed\norder.\nA hearing on the motion was held on October 24, 2006.  Following the hearing, this Court asked\nfor  letter  briefs  addressing  why  dismissal  should  be  granted  even  though  the  district  is  now\npredominately African-American.  Before these briefs were due, the defendant District moved to\n\n1:68-cv-00698-MBS     Date Filed 12/18/06    Entry Number 6     Page 2 of 7\nwithdraw the joint motion for approval of the agreed order of dismissal stating it had failed to meet all\nof the factors enumerated in Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent, Va., 391 U.S. 430, 435 (1968).  The\nDistrict further stated that historic under-funding since entry of the desegregation order prevented the\noffering of all needed educational services to its students who are predominately African-American and\nwas thus a failure to remove all vestiges of the prior dual system.\nBackground\n   The District’s initial efforts at desegregation consisted of offering students the freedom to\nchoose the school they attended.  Through the 1969-70 school year, a handful of black students attended\nthree formerly white schools with enrollments ranging from seven to 11 percent black.  No white\nstudents attended any of the three de jure black schools in which most of the black students were\nenrolled.1  Following the mandates of Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals precedent\n(citations omitted), on March 30, 1970, this Court ordered implementation of a geographically zoned\ndesegregation plan which was implemented beginning in the 1970-71 school year.2    For the 2005-06\nschool year, the school district enrolled approximately1693 students of whom 1595 were African-\n1 The chart in the parties’ Joint Memorandum in Support of Declaration of Unitary Status\nand Dismissal lists student enrollment for the 1969-70 school year at these schools except for C.V.\nBing Elementary, stating that the enrollment number for that school is illegible in the 1970 Order. \nThe United States located a legible copy of the order which shows that 847 black students and 0\nwhite students were enrolled at C.V. Bing Elementary.  The total black enrollment for the District\nshould read 2,068.  The total enrollment in the District for the 1969-70 school year was 3000\nstudents, 69 percent of whom were black and 31 percent of whom were white.\n2 School survey data collected by HEW/OCR show that approximately 31 percent of District\nstudents in 1967-68 and 1968-69 were white.  When the plan was implemented in 1970, both black\nand white student enrollment numbers declined, and the percentage of white students fell to 23\npercent.  This pattern continued in the 1972-73 school year.  By 1978, there was a small increase in\nthe number of black students and a continuing decline in the number of white students.  The overall\npercentage of white students was at 19 percent with a total enrollment of 2,517 students.  The\npercentage of black students at each school ranged from 72 to 89 percent.  Since then, enrollment\nhas declined for both white and black students, but at a faster pace for white student enrollment. \n2\n\n1:68-cv-00698-MBS     Date Filed 12/18/06    Entry Number 6     Page 3 of 7\nAmerican and 54 were white.  The enrollment in the District’s four schools for the 2005-06 school\nyear is shown in the following table.\nSchool No. B % B No. W % W Total\nAllendale ES 553 96% 12 2% 577\nFairfax ES 278 92% 17 5.6% 301\nAllendale Fairfax MS 374 93.5% 10 2.5% 400\nAllendale Fairfax HS 390 94% 15 3.6% 415\nDistrict Total 1595 94% 54 3.1% 1693\nDiscussion\nTo respond to the court’s question concerning whether a school district with a predominately\nAfrican-American  student  enrollment  such  as  Allendale  County  can  be  dismissed  from  court\nsupervision, it might be helpful to set out the relevant legal considerations.  The standard established\nby the Supreme Court for determining whether a school district has achieved unitary status, thus\nwarranting termination of  judicial supervision, is: (1) whether the school district has fully and\nsatisfactorily complied with the court’s desegregation orders for a reasonable period of time; (2)\nwhether the school district has eliminated the vestiges of past de jure discrimination to the extent\npracticable; and (3) whether the school district has demonstrated a good faith commitment to the\nwhole of the court’s order and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution which were the\npredicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.

A starting point in the inquiry is “the degree of racial\nimbalance in the school district, that is to say a comparison of the proportion of majority to minority\nstudents in individual schools with the proportions of the races in the district as a whole.”  Freeman\n3\n\n1:68-cv-00698-MBS     Date Filed 12/18/06    Entry Number 6     Page 4 of 7\nv. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 474, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1437 (1992).  In Allendale, all middle and high school\nstudents attend the same school, and thus mirror the racial composition of the District.  Racial\ncomposition does not vary significantly at the elementary schools.  In addition,  the court must keep in\nmind that vestiges must only be removed to the extent practicable.  Given the racial composition of the\nDistrict, further student desegregation is not feasible.  We do not believe that the school district would\nquarrel with this assertion.    \nMoreover, that there are few white students enrolled in the system, does not by itself indicate\nthat the District is in violation of this Court’s order or failed to meet the standards of a unitary school\nsystem.  The existence of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself\nthe mark of a system that still practices segregation by law.  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEd., 402 U.S. 1, 26, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1281 (1971).    See, Singleton v. Jackson Mun. Separate Sch. Dist.,\n419 F.2d 1211, 1221 (5th Cir. 1969) (In the companion case involving the St. John the Baptist Parish\nSchool Board, the court refused to divide the small number of white students among five schools even\nthough all white students attended a single school where they were still in the minority).  Here, the\nwhite students attend each District school and there is no practicable means to achieve further\ndesegregation.  \nThe Charleston County School District operates eight separate or constituent school districts\nwhich existed prior to the creation of the county district.  Student assignment continues to be made\nwithin the confines of each constituent district. In a challenge to this system, the court determined\nthat a desegregation analysis should be made within each constituent district, not across the county.\nEven though predominately black schools existed in some of the constituent districts, the court held\nthat the system was unitary since there were no schools reserved or designated for white or black\nstudents, but that student assignment reflected enrollment with the constituent district, at least three\nof which were predominately black.  U.S. v. Charleston County School Dist., 738 F. Supp. 1513, 1531-\n\n1:68-cv-00698-MBS     Date Filed 12/18/06    Entry Number 6     Page 5 of 7\n33 (D.S.C. 1990), affirmed, U.S. v. Charleston County School Dist., 960 F.2d 1227 (4th Cir. 1992).  The\nfact that the school district enrollment becomes exceedingly one race does not equate to illegal\nsegregation nor preclude a declaration of unitary status.  Id., citing, Richmond v. Baliles, 829 F.2d 1308\n(4th Cir.1987)(86.4 percent black student enrollment with many schools exceeding 90 percent black);\nCalhoun v. Cook, 522 F.2d 717 (5th Cir.1975)(92 of 148 schools in the Atlanta, Georgia system were\nover 90 percent black); Goldsboro City Board of Education v. Wayne County Board of Education, 745\nF.2d 324 (4th Cir.1984)(schools were 77 percent black).\nFinally, the Allendale school system has no control over the actions of students who reside in\nthe District but do not attend public schools. “[The courts] are not at present charged with a\nresponsibility to remedy problems caused by demography and private racism.”  Charleston, 738 F.Supp.\nat 1523, quoting, Goldsboro City Bd. of Educ. v. Wayne County Bd. of Educ., 745 F.2d 324, 333 (4th\nCir.1984). \nDefendants’ Motion \nDefendants now move for withdrawal of the Joint Motion for Approval of Agreed Order of\nUnitary Status and Dismissal.  The basis for their motion is the stated failure to meet one of the factors3\nenumerated in Green as it relates to insufficient funding for the District since entry of the desegregation\norder, and that this lack of funding prevented the offering of needed educational services for its\npredominantly African-American students.  Defendants do not state precisely where this vestige\nremains.  Without this information, it is impossible to assess whether there are in fact still vestiges of\nthe prior dual system, what practicable steps could be taken to address or eliminate them or whether\nsuch steps could be ordered by this Court\n3These factors are student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities\nand facilities.  Green at 436, 88 S.Ct. at 1693.\n5\n\n1:68-cv-00698-MBS     Date Filed 12/18/06    Entry Number 6     Page 6 of 7\nIssues related to past or present funding did not arise during the review of the District by the\nUnited States nor in the determination that the District is unitary.  These new questions evidently relate\nto the December 29, 2005 Order in a funding case in state court, Abbeville County Sch. Dist. v. State\nof South Carolina, brought by several school systems, including the Allendale County School District.\nThis order found for the plaintiffs on the proposition that students in these systems were denied the\nopportunity to receive an effective and adequately funded early childhood education program to address\nthe impact of poverty on educational achievement.  We note that this State case made no claims under\nFederal law nor were there allegations that funding issues were related to racial discrimination or were\nvestiges of a dual system.  As noted by this Court during the October hearing, the Allendale County\nSchool District operates under State control; counsel for defendants advised the United States that full\ncontrol will not be returned to the local board until May 2007.  \nThe defendants’ motion, in our view, does not provide a sufficient factual or legal basis to\nsupport withdrawal of the joint motion, at least for the matters contained therein.  However, out of an\nabundance of caution, and to ensure that all vestiges of the prior dual system have been eliminated to\nthe extent practicable, we request that the Court give the United States time to obtain further\ninformation regarding the new issue raised by defendants, to determine what particular vestige remains\nthat defendants are referring to, whether it can be practicably eliminated, and if so, whether a court\norder is necessary to achieve that end, and what relief should be ordered if an order is deemed\nappropriate.  Since the defendants raise new questions, the United States recommends that this Court\nprovide the parties six months to continue the cooperative exchange of information on this new issue.\nFollowing our review, we will advise the court regarding which motion should be granted. In\nall events, it appears that partial unitary status is appropriate in all areas previously agreed upon by the\nparties. \n6\n\n1:68-cv-00698-MBS     Date Filed 12/18/06    Entry Number 6     Page 7 of 7\nConclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the United States requests that both motions be held in abeyance\nfor six months.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWAN J.

The District does not wish to further its efforts toward unitary status at this \ntime because all factors enumerated in Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent County, Va., 391 \nU.S. 430, 435 (1968) have not been met in that the funding for the District since the entry of the \ndesegregation order has been significantly below the needs of the District, which has prevented it \nfrom offering all need ed educational services for its students, who are over 90% African-\nAmerican.  Thus, the historic under-funding since the entry of the desegregation order is a major \nfunction in the failure to remove all vestiges of the prior dual system.     \nWHEREFORE, the District prays that its motion be granted without prejudice with leave \nto refile a Motion for Unitary Status and Dismissal. \nRespectfully submitted, this 29th day of November, 2006. \n \n\n1:68-cv-00698-MBS     Date Filed 11/29/06    Entry Number 5     Page 2 of 2\n \ns/ Charles J.
