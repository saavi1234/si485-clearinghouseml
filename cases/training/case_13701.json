    "summary": "<p>This school desegregation case from Caddo Parish, Louisiana, was filed in 1965 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, with Judge Ben Dawkins presiding. As of 2020, it is still ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, 1965, the parents of seven African American school children brought this putative class-action suit on their behalf against the defendants, Caddo Parish School Board, to enjoin the operation of a racially segregated school district. Shortly thereafter, the United States was allowed to intervene as a plaintiff and has remained actively involved in the case since then.</p>\r\n<p>Initially, the Board pursued a freedom-of-choice approach to desegregation. The Fifth Circuit at first approved the use of freedom of choice plans in <em>United States v. Jefferson</em>. 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. Dec. 29, 1966). And even in the wake of <em>Green v. County School Board of New Kent County</em>, 391 U.S. 430 (1968), in which the Supreme Court expressed frustration at the inadequacy of freedom-of-choice plans, the Western District continued to accept them as a viable option. <em>See</em> <em>Adams v. Matthews</em>, 401 F.2d 181 (5th Cir. Aug. 20, 1968); <em>Conley v. Lake Charles School Board</em>, 293 F.Supp. 84, 87 (W.D. La. Nov. 14, 1968) (including Caddo Parish). Ultimately, however, in <em>Hall v. St. Helena Parish</em>, a consolidated appeal of cases from across the Circuit, the Fifth Circuit ordered the district courts to reverse course and solicit alternative plans from the various defendant school boards. 417 F.2d 801 (5th Cir. May 28, 1969) (including Caddo Parish). <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Please see Related School Desegregation Cases in the Western District of Louisiana&nbsp;for more information on freedom-of-choice</a>.</p>\r\n<p>By the early 1970s, there was a major split in the various factions of private plaintiffs, leading them to play less of an active role in the suit. During this time, the United States was involved with negotiations with the district court and the Board. In 1976, the Board filed a motion to have the school system declared unitary, which would have warranted the dismissal of the original suit. However, the United States opposed the motion. In 1977, the district court: (1) ruled that the Board had fully complied with the 1973 court-ordered desegregation plan, (2) declared the school system to be unitary, and (3) dismissed the suit against the Board. Thereafter, the United States filed a motion to amend the judgment, which suspended the finality of the judgment, claiming procedural irregularities and substantive deficiencies in the ruling. No private plaintiffs came forward to proceed with the suit, so the United States engaged in negotiations as the main plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>After five years of negotiations with the Board, the parties reached an agreement and on May 5, 1981, the district court entered a consent decree that largely still governs the Board's desegregation efforts. The consent decree stipulated that the Board was required to desegregate its public schools and to establish a unitary system that does not discriminate against black students. The decree, among other things, called for the establishment of magnet schools to achieve desegregation of certain schools, as well as developing programs that would result in integration of all-black schools.</p>\r\n<p>By 1990, the district court found that the Board had met many of its targets from the 1981 consent decree and thus relieved the Board of its obligations under the consent decree as to magnet schools. However, the provisions of the consent decree applicable to all-black schools remained in force. The Board was still obligated to provide a level of education at two all-black schools (Booker T. Washington and Fair Park) that was qualitatively equal to that of the others in the system. The Board was also obligated to continue efforts to integrate these two all-black schools, which were deemed vestiges of past unconstitutional race discrimination.</p>\r\n<p>In December 2013, Louisiana&rsquo;s Recovery School District (&ldquo;RSD&rdquo;) intervened in the Board&rsquo;s management of academically unacceptable schools, one of which was Fair Park. The RSD entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Board that imposed specific requirements for the management of these schools. Preliminary reports indicated that the actions taken had some desired effect of improving the academic performance of Fair Park students, but the Board voted to close this high school by the end of the semester.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2017, the Board approved a plan to merge these two all-black schools into Booker T. Washington. A separate lawsuit,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17445\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Cooksey v. Caddo Parish School Board</a>, was filed in the same district court on May 5, 2017, by parents of some black students at Fair Park high school. They sued the Caddo Parish School Board for its abrupt decision to merge the two all-black schools as the solution for the Board&rsquo;s alleged need to &ldquo;right-size&rdquo; the district and to generate funds to teacher pay raises. The plaintiffs alleged that the Board&rsquo;s action was manifestly race-based in violation of the equal protection requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, Louisiana&rsquo;s state law, and the mandates of the 1981 consent decree. On February 20, 2018, the parties in the Cooksey lawsuit filed a stipulated dismissal. While the suit was pending, the school merger was completed, and the parties stipulated that the merger was ultimately unrelated to the 1981 consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>In the original case filed in 1965, after many reassignments of judges over the decades, the case was reassigned to Judge Elizabeth Foote on May 23, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>As of 2020, the school system had yet to attain unitary status and the district court retained its supervision of the Board's efforts to desegregate.</p>\r\n<p><u>Available Opinions</u></p>\r\n<p><em>United States v.

JONES, et al.,\nPlaintiffs\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Intervenor-Appellee\nJUNE PHILLIPS,\nApplicant for Intervention-Appellant\nV.\nCADDO PARISH SCHOOL BOARD, et al.,\nDefendants-Appellees\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES ON REHEARING EN BANC\nSTATEMENT REGARDING JURISDICTION\nBecause the district court properly denied the motion to\nintervene, this Court does not have jurisdiction and the appeal\nshould be dismissed. Weiser v. White, 505 F.2d 912 (5th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 421 U.S. 993 (1975).\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nWhether the district court properly denied June Phillips'\nmotion to intervene to challenge the consent decree negotiated by\nthe United States and the School Board in this school desegregation\ncase.\nSTATEMENT\nBecause the opening brief and the majority and dissenting\nopinions of the panel recite the history of this litigation in\n\ndetail, this statement will address only those facts essential to\nthe United States' arguments.\nA. Facts\nThis school desegregation action was filed in 1965 by plain-\ntiffs purporting to represent a class of black parents and students\n1/\nin Caddo Parish (R. 1).(cid:9) This Court sanctioned the United States'\nintervention in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\n372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), aff'd 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.) (en\nbanc), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 840 (1967).\nPlans to desegregate the Caddo Parish School system have been\ndisapproved in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nsu ra; Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 417 F.2d 801 (5th\nCir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 904 (1969), and Jones v. Caddo Parish\nSchool Board, 421 F.2d 313 (5th Cir. 1970).\nOn June 1, 1973, a bi-racial committee appointed by the\ndistrict court filed with the court a plan to desegregate the school\nsystem. The private plaintiffs initially filed objections to the\nplan. Shortly thereafter, original counsel for the plaintiffs,\nJesse Stone, moved to strike as counsel lawyers from the NAACP Legal\nDefense Fund because of their objections to the plan and to substi-\ntute Murphy Bell as counsel for the plaintiffs. This motion was\ngranted on July 13, 1973. The United States noted that the plan\nwould leave intact some 34 one-race schools, but concluded: \"The\npresent posture of this law suit considered, the United States\nof America, intervenor herein, interjects no objection to ordering\nimplementation of this plan.\"(cid:9) Upon motion of plaintiffs' new\n1/ \"R.\" references are to the record.\n\n-3-\ncounsel, the district court then struck the objections to the\nplan and on July 20, 1973, ordered implementation of the consent\ndecree. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914\n(5th Cir. 1974).\nApproximately four months later, lawyers from the NAACP\nLegal Defense Fund filed a motion to intervene on behalf of a class\nof black students in Caddo Parish together with a complaint\nchallenging the constitutionality of the desegregation plan.\nAfter the district court held that the motion was untimely and the\nintervenors were already adequately represented, this Court remanded\nthe case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the\nmotion to intervene. Ibid. On remand, no hearing was requested\nor held.\nOn July 20, 1976, the Citizens Advisory Committee, appointed\nto monitor implementation of the plan, reported on several deficien-\ncies in the Board's implementation. The district court appointed a\nspecial master to investigate and report on progress under the plan.\nIn September 1976, the Board filed a motion to have the\nsystem declared unitary and the action dismissed. In October 1977,\nthe United States opposed the motion as premature since the\nspecial master had yet to report and noted several deficiencies in\nthe implementation of the 1973 decree. Plaintiffs, through counsel\nWilliam Jefferson, also filed a memorandum in opposition to the\nBoard's motion, noting shortcomings in the Board's implementation\nof the 1973 plan. This was the only paper filed by plaintiffs\nbetween 1974 and the present. On December 30, 1977, the district\ncourt declared the system unitary and dismissed the action (R. 2442).\n\n-4-\nThe United States, relying for the first time on the ground\nthat the 1973 decree had allowed too many one-race schools, moved\nto amend the district court's judgment (R. 2443), but none of the\noriginal plaintiffs either appealed or moved to amend the judgment.\nA year and a half later, on June 30, 1980, the district court\nentered a minute order, stating in part (R. 2510):\nIf the original plaintiffs still have a viable\ninterest in this case, their counsel should contact\nthe court, in writing, within thirty (30) days of\nthis order. If the plaintiffs' counsel does not\nrespond, this Court will consider that the plaintiffs\nacquiesce in having their interests represented by the\nUnited States as plaintiff-intervenor.\nThis notice was sent to all past and present counsel of record.\nNo representative came forward (R. 2993).\nDuring this period, the United States and the Board entered\nnegotiations to resolve the issues raised by the United States'\nmotion to amend the judgment of unitariness. At no point during\nthese negotiations did anyone purporting to represent private\nplaintiffs attempt to participate in the negotiations. During\nFebruary, March and April 1981, when the decree was taking shape,\nnumerous public meetings were held (R. 2883, 2827). The negotia-\ntions concluded on May 5, 1981, with the signing by the United\nStates and the Board of a settlement agreement. Two days later,\nin response to the joint motion of the parties, the district\ncourt entered the agreement (R. 2584, 2606). The court ordered\n\n4(cid:9) n\n..•..(cid:9) •. ^..__a ......_w J-J.(cid:9) -. . f4(cid:9) .J.Y.s..(cid:9) .a .w<_.. t.l ..._.(cid:9) a..(cid:9) Y ^. •.._(cid:9) 5. .. .(cid:9) .

The decree was published\nin two local newspapers and was reported by three local television\nstations.\nBy the close of the ten day period, thirteen objections had\nbeen received, including one from Ms. Phillips who argued that the\ndecree failed to provide enrichment programs for black students\n(R. 2656). On May 22,,1981, four days after expiration of the\nperiod for objections, Phillips filed a motion to intervene\nindividually and on behalf of a class of black students (R. 2724).\nIn this motion she raised for the first time her complaint that\nthe decree left too many black students in one-race schools. On\nMay 27 and June 8, she filed supplemental motions to intervene\n(R. 2763, 2812). Also on June 8, the United States and the\nBoard each filed memoranda opposing Phillips' motion to intervene\n(R. 2825, 2891).\nOn June 17, 1981, the district court denied the motions to\nintervene and on July 2, 1981, it overruled all objections to the\nconsent decree and ordered its implementation (R. 3026, 3038).\nOn July 16, Phillips filed a notice of appeal from the order of\nJune 17, denying her motion to intervene and from the order of\nJuly 2, overruling her objections to the consent decree (R. 3078).\nOn May 6, 1983, a divided panel of this Court dismissed\nPhillips' appeal, holding that the district court had not abused\n\n- 6 -\nits discretion in finding her motion to intervene untimely. On\nOctober 11, 1983, this Court ordered rehearing of the case en banc.\n1. The consent decree and motion to intervene\nThe consent decree, signed by the district court on May 7,\n1981, dealt comprehensively with the desegregation of the Caddo\nParish schools. It contemplated reduction of the number of one-\nrace schools in the system from thirty-three to fourteen (R. 2912).\nIn fact, the number of one-race schools has now been reduced to\nfifteen. It promised to reduce the number of whites attending\none-race schools from 5,831 to 945 and the number of black\nstudents in such schools from 14,054 to 8,975 (ibid.). The\nfigures for September 1983, show that 327 whites and approximately\n2/\n11,000 blacks remain in one-race schools.\nThe consent decree ordered the Roard to undertake a variety\nof remedies to promote the interrelated goals of desegregation\nand enhanced quality of education. These remedies include majority-\nto-minority transfers, attendance zone changes and student reassign-\nments, school closings and new construction, and the development\n2/ Part of the discrepancy between the projected and actual\nnumber of blacks in one-race schools is attributable to the\nconversion through demographic changes of Fair Park High School\nfrom a predominantly white to a predominantly black school.\nThis adds 1352 black students to this statistic. In addition,\nthe complete effect of the decree cannot be measured until various\neducational enhancement and voluntary transfer programs have had\nan opportunity to work. Furthermore, there has been a one year\ndelay in construction of the Huntington School, which was slated\nto open in 1983, but is now scheduled to open in 1984.\n\n-7-\nof seven magnet schools and one laboratory school and special\neducational programs. The decree established a timetable for\nimplementation beginning in the autumn of 1981 with the\nestablishment of magnet schools and concluding in 1983-1984\nwith the opening of the new Huntington School. (R. 2576).\nIn her motions to intervene, Phillips contended that the\nconsent decree failed to require special programs at the all-black\nschools that would remain under the decree, allowed the survival\nof too many one-race schools, failed generally to promote desegre-\ngation of the system, placed an undue burden on black students by\nrequiring various attendance zone changes, and limited admissions\nto magnet and laboratory schools. She also contended that notice\nshould have been given before entry of the decree to the class\nthat she sought to represent.\n2. The district court's decisions\nPhillips has appealed from two orders of the district court;\nthe first of June 17, 1981, denying her motion to intervene and the\nsecond of July 2, 1981, overruling her objections to the consent\ndecree.\n\n-8-\nWith regard to Phillips' motion to intervene, the district\ncourt concluded that she had failed to satisfy the timeliness\nrequirement of Rule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., and had failed to\ncarry her burden of demonstrating that the United States had not\nrepresented her interests adequately. On the matter of timeliness,\nthe court recounted that Phillips had not filed a motion to inter-\nvene or otherwise opposed the 1973 consent decree, had not responded\nto the minute entry of June 3, 1980, and had not sought intervention\nduring the highly publicized negotiations conducted by the United\nStates and the Board from February to May 1981. The court concluded\nthat Phillips sought to\nsubstitute her judgment for the considered\nopinion of the * * * School Board, The\nDepartment oaf Justice and this court that\nthe Consent Decree will constitutionally\ndesegregate the Caddo Parish School system.\nShe asks that the court allow her to second\nguess the months of turmoil and negotiations\ncarried on by the parties, after she took no\nsteps to participate in that process. This\nthe court cannot allow.(cid:9) (R. 2936).\nThe district court also concluded that Phillips had failed\nto establish that her interests had not been represented adequately\nby the parties to the settlement (ibid.). Relying on Hines v.\nRapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762 (5th Cir. 1973) and Pate\nv. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,\n444 U.S. 835 (1979), the court concluded that the issues presented\n\n-9-\nby Phillips had all been considered and addressed by the United\nStates and the Board and that, as a result, there remained no issue\nthat Phillips could best represent. The court then addressed\nseparately the issues of special programs, magnet schools, zone\nchanges, one-race schools and the burden that the decree placed on\nblack students and concluded that Phillips' contentions with regard\nto each lacked merit (R. 2937-2941).\nIn the same memorandum, the court rejected Phillips' conten-\ntion that this was a class action requiring notice to the class\nbefore a decree could be entered (R. 2939). The court held that a\nclass was never certified and that the United States had never been\ncertified as a class representative, nor purported to act as such.\nThe court also concluded that the attention and publicity attending\nthe negotiation of the consent decree were sufficient to alert all\ninterested parties to the terms of the decree (ibid.).\nFinally, the court disposed of Phillips' contention that\nshe was entitled to a hearing under Calhoun v. Cook, 487 F.2d 680\n(5th Cir. 1973). The court distinguished Calhoun as a case in\nwhich there was a dispute whether all parties to the suit had agreed\nto the settlement. The court found no doubt that the United States\nand the Board had reached a settlement (ibid.).\nPhillips also appeals from the July 2, 1981 order rejecting\nher objections to the consent decree. In a memorandum opinion\nissued that same date, the district court discussed the thirteen\n\n- 10 -\nobjections to the decree, including those of Phillips. The court\ncharacterized Phillips' objections as focusing on the decree's lack\nof specificity regarding educational enhancement programs and the\nfailure to provide for pre-school educational programs. The court\nfound that the decree made ample provision for educational enhance-\nment programs and that Phillips' concern regarding preschool\nprograms, while legitimate, did not allege any failure to desegre-\ngate the system (R. 3026).\n3. The Hanel decision\nOn May 6, 1983, a divided panel of this Court dismissed\nPhillips' appeal. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 704 F.2d\n206. The majority held that the lawsuit was not a class action\nand could, therefore, be settled by the United States and the\nBoard, as the sole remaining parties. It further held that\nPhillips' motion to intervene was properly denied without a\nhearing as untimely. The panel majority reasoned that Ms.\nPhillips could not remain silent through 16 years of litigation\nbefore seeking intervention some 15 days after entry of a consent\ndecree. The majority noted, id. at 218, that Phillips' motion\nto intervene attacked the 1973 decree, yet she waited 8 years\nto raise this objection. The majority also found significant\nthat Phillips failed to challenge the 1977 declaration that the\nsystem was unitary and she did not seek to intervene while the\nUnited States and the Board conducted well-publicized negotiations,\n\n- 11 -\nincluding meetings with the community, in early 1981. Ibid.\nThe majority concluded that because of her active role in the\neducational affairs of Caddo Parish, Phillips was aware of her\ninterest in this case long before she sought to intervene. The\nmajority concluded that Phillips' great and unexplained delay\nmade her motion to intervene prima facie untimely. Id. at 222.\nIn addition, the majority held that because this is not a class\naction, Phillips is not prevented by principles of res judicata\nfrom bringing a separate lawsuit. Id. at 217.\nJudge Goldberg, in dissent, disagreed with the majority\nthat untimeliness could be determined in this case without a\nhearing. He argued that timeliness under Rule 24(a)(2) must be\nmeasured from the point at which the representation of the inter-\nvenor's interest by existing parties became inadequate.\nJudge Goldberg found that Phillips had alleged facts that,\nif true, showed that she had a greater and therefore distinct\ninterest in a desegregated school system that was not adequately\nrepresented by the United States in negotiating the 1981 consent\ndecree. He concluded that a hearing was necessary to determine\nwhether Phillips could reasonably have known prior to publica-\ntion of the 1981 consent decree that her interest was not adequately\nrepresented.\n\n- 12 -\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in finding\nPhillips' motion to intervene untimely on its face. Phillips'\nmotion to intervene, which was filed over two weeks after the\nUnited States and the School Board presented a proposed consent\ndecree to the district court, alleged that the United States had\nfailed to represent adequately her interest in eliminating one-\nrace schools. Her allegation, however, addressed segregation that\nsurvived the 1973 consent decree between the private plaintiffs\nand the Board, to which the United States did not object. Phillips'\ncontention, therefore, actually amounts to an allegation that the\nUnited States' representation first became inadequate in 1973 when\nit failed to object to the consent decree that left 34 one-race\nschools.\nBecause the United States agrees that timeliness under Rule\n24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., must be measured from the date that the\nalleged inadequacy of representation first arose, United Airlines,\nInc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977), Phillips' motion was properly\nfound untimely on its face. United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d\n314 (5th Cir. 1982). Moreover, even if timeliness is measured\nfrom some later point in the litigation, Phillips' unexplained delay\nremains inexcusable. Although she was aware of the United States'\nand the Board's well-publicized efforts to produce a consent decree,\nshe failed to move for intervention until four days after expiration\nof the period for objecting to the decree.\n\n- 13 -\nApplication of the factors for measuring timeliness\narticulated by this Court in Stallworth v. Monsanto, 558 F.2d 257\n(1977), confirms that the district court correctly denied Phillips'\nmotion. The United States and the Board would suffer substantial\nprejudice as a result of Phillips' delay. By failing to intervene\nin a timely fashion, Phillips permitted the United States and the\nBoard to expend time, resources and effort setting this litigation\nin the belief that they were the only interested parties remaining\nin the litigation. Granting her motion would have required the\nparties to litigate the United States' motion to amend the judgment\nof unitariness.\nPhillips, by contrast, has not suffered measurable prejudice\nby denial of her intervention. Her interest in eliminating one-\nrace schools was served by the 1981 decree, which has already\neliminated 19 one-race schools. In addition, because she was not\na party to the decree she remains free to file a separate lawsuit\nseeking further desegregation.\nThe district court also did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Phillips' intervention, since her interest was adequately\nrepresented by the United States which shared the same interest in\ndismantling the dual school system. The United States, therefore,\ncould only have failed to represent Phillips' interest if it\ncolluded with the School Board, represented an interest that was\nactually adverse to Phillips, or failed to perform adequately as\n\n- 14 -\na representative. Martin v. Kalvar Corp., 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th\nCir. 1969).\nPhillips' assertions boil down to a contention that the\nUnited States did not advocate adequately her interest in reducing\nthe number of one-race schools. The United States contends, how-\never, that by negotiating the elimination of 19 of the 34 one-race\nschools it fully represented Phillips' interest. The decree appears\neven more adequate in view of the fact that it is a consent decree\nthat properly reflects the parties' calculations regarding the\nrisks of litigation and embodies a compromise. See United States\nv. City of Miami, 664 F.2d 435 (5th Cir.) (en banc); Cotton v.\nHinton, 559 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir. 1977). Because Phillips failed to\nallege any facts that could, if true, make the compelling showing\nnecessary to establish inadequate representation by the United\nStates in a school desegregation case, the district court properly\ndenied her motion without a hearing.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY\nCONCLUDED THAT MS. PHILLIPS'\nMOTION TO INTERVENE WAS UNTIMELY\nMs. Phillips contends that the United States failed adequately\n3/\nto represent her interest in eliminating one-race schools.(cid:9) Her\nassertion comes too late to be heard by this Court. The United\n3/ The United States contends (infra, pp. 25-35) that it has repre-\nsented Phillips' interests adequately throughout this litigation.\n\nA\n15 -\n- \nStates took the position as early as 1973 that it would not object\nin this case to a consent decree that left some 34 one-race schools\nin the system. Under Rule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., timeliness\nmust he measured from the date that the alleged inadequacy \nof\nrepresentation first arose. Phillips' challenge to this alleged\nbreakdown in representation first surfaced, however, some eight\nyears later, and seven years after the failure of other potential\nclass representatives to pursue the hearing this Court directed\nthe district court to hold regarding the adequacy of the 1973\ndecree. In these circumstances, the district court's decision on\ntimeliness was plainly correct.\nRule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., requires that an intervenor\nseeking to intervene as of right has the burden of establishing\nthat (1) the application for intervention is timely; (2) the inter-\nvenor has an interest in the subject matter of the litigation; (3)\nthe applicant's ability to protect that interest may be impaired\nor impeded by the disposition of the action; and (4) the interest\nof the intervenor not be adequately represented by the existing\nparties. A deficient showing on any of these four requirements\nwill defeat intervention under Rule 24(a)(2). NAACP V. New York,\n413 U.S. 345, 369 (1973).\nA. The standard for determining timeliness\nThe timeliness of an application for intervention is an\nissue addressed to the discretion of the district court and \"is to\n\n- 16 -\nbe determined from all the circumstances.\" Id. at 366. Accordingly,\na determination of untimeliness can only be overturned if an abuse\nof discretion is shown. Ibid.\nThis Court's thoroughly analyzed the issue of timeliness\nunder Rule 24 in Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257 (1977).\nThat case, identified four factors to structure the inquiry into\ntimeliness (id. at 264-266):\n[1] The length of time during which\nthe would-be intervenor actually\nknew or reasonably should have\nknown of his interest in the case\nbefore he petitioned for leave to\nintervene.\n[2] The extent of the prejudice that\nthe existing parties to the liti-\ngation may suffer as a result of\nthe would-be intervenor's failure\nto apply for intervention as soon\nas he actually knew or reasonably\nshould have known of his interest\nin the case.\n[3] The extent of the prejudice that the\nwould-be intervenor may suffer if his\npetition for leave to intervene is\ndenied.\n[4] The existence of unusual circumstances\nmilitating either for or against a deter-\nmination that the application is timely.\n\n- 17 -\nThe first of these factors is seminal. It establishes the\nstarting point for application of the remaining factors by fixing\nthe point from which timeliness is to be measured. Stallworth\nrejects heavy reliance on absolute measures of timeliness, such as\nthe length of time the litigation has been pending and whether\njudgment has already been rendered and looks instead to when the\nwould-be intervenor learned or reasonably should have learned of\nhis interest in litigation. Id. at 266. As this Court has\nindicated since Stallworth, such absolute measures are relevant,\nbut they are not decisive. See United States v. Marion County\n4/\nSchool District, 590 F.2d 146, 149 (1979). What must be determined\nis when the applicant could reasonably have been expected to seek\nto intervene and the time that lapsed thereafter before intervention\nwas actually sought.\nIn some instances -- and this is one of them -- that threshold\ndetermination cannot be resolved without reference as well to the\nfourth criterion for intervention under Rule 24(a)(2) -- inadequacy\nof representation by existing parties. For, it cannot be gainsaid\nthat one's \"interest\" in participating directly in another's lawsuit\ncould well mature only after learning that the initial identity\nof interest in the subject matter had disintegrated and a different\nlegal viewpoint was being asserted by the litigating party.\n4/ Other courts of appeals have considered such absolute measures\ndecisive.(cid:9) See e.g., Pennsylvania v. Rizzo, 530 F.2d 501 (3d Cir.),\ncert. denied, 426 U.S. 921 (1976); United States v. South Bend\nCommunity School Corp., 710 F.2d 394, 395 (7th Cir. 1983).\n\n0\n- 18 -\nWhile Stallworth did not explicitly link timeliness to\nadequacy of representation, it noted, id. at 264, that the Supreme\nCourt in United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977),\nhad done so. In McDonald, the Supreme Court affirmed the holding\nof the Seventh Circuit that a member of a putative class, whose\nclass had been denied certification, timely filed a motion to\nintervene for purposes of pursuing an appeal to challenge the\ndenial of class certification. The motion to intervene was filed\n18 days after entry of final judgment. This was shortly after the\nwould-be intervenor learned that the named plaintiffs did not\nintend to appeal the denial of class certification. In affirming\nthe timeliness of the motion, the Court stated, id. at 394:\nIn short, as soon as it became\nclear to the respondent that the\ninterests of the unnamed class\nmembers would no longer be pro-\ntected by the named class repre-\nsentatives, she promptly moved to\nintervene to protect those interests.\n[Footnote omitted]\nAccord: Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306, 1321 (5th Cir.) cert.\ndenied, 449 U.S. 1011 (1980), where this Court, citing United\nAirlines, Inc. v. McDonald, supra, recognized that \"the question\nof timeliness is at least partially linked to the question of\n5/\nadequate representation.\"\n5/ This understanding of the linkage between timeliness and\nadequacy of representation is compelled by the logic of Rule\n24(a)(2). The Rule provides a mechanism for representation of the\ninterests of absentees that will be affected by the litigation.\nOn the other hand, the requirement that a would-be intervenor\ndemonstrate that no party in the litigation is adequately representing\n\n- 19 -\nB. Application of the timeliness standard\n1. Ms. Phillips reasonably should have known of the alleged\ninadequacy of representation since at least 1974.\nApplication of the foregoing principles to the present\ncase, demonstrates that Ms. Phillips' attempted intervention\n6/\nwas out of time. Taking Phillips' allegations at face value,\nrepresentation of the interest that she now seeks to assert --\nreduction of the number of one-race schools -- if it ever became\ninadequate, did so in 1974, at the latest. As described (supra,\npp. 2-3), the representatives of the class that Phillips seeks to\nrepresent signed a consent decree in 1973 that contemplated more\nthan twice the number of schools left one-race by the 1981 decree.\nThis number, Phillips concedes, included nearly all of the schools\nthat she now contends must not be allowed to remain one-race (Br.\n7/\n9-lO)T The United States, upon whom Phillips contends she relied\n5/ (Continued)\nhis interest discourages multiple representation and promotes\njudicial economy and efficiency. A rule that failed to link timeli-\nness to the requirement of inadequate representation would frustrate\nthis purpose and invite unnecessary applications for intervention.\nMoreover, such applications would be denied uniformly, since a\nwould-be intervenor cannot successfully apply for intervention until\nrepresentation becomes inadequate. It would make little sense to\nmeasure timeliness from a point at which a would-be intervenor could\nnot move successfully for intervention.\n6/ The United States contends (infra, pp. 31-32 n. 13) that many\nof Phillips' allegations are erroneous. For purposes of this first\nargument, however, we need not discuss those errors.\n7/ \"Br.\" references are to June Phillips' \"Fourth Supplemental\nBrief.\"\n\n- 20 -\nfor representation, did not object to the 1973 decree. Indeed, a\ngroup of attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund unsuccessfully\nsought intervention to challenge the 1973 decree in the district\ncourt. This Court remanded the case to the district court for a\nhearing on the motion to intervene, Jones v. Caddo Parish School\nBoard, 499 F.2d 914, (1974), but the intervenors never returned to\nthe district court. Ms. Phillips' claim of inadequate representa-\ntion (such as it is) thus ripened at that time and her efforts to\nintervene should have occurred then, or shortly thereafter -- and\nnot some seven years later.\nPhillips has not alleged, nor could she, that she was unaware\nof the 1973 decree or the fact that as of 1974 nobody was seeking\nto challenge the decree. As a parent with children in the school\nsystem during this period and as an educator who served as a member\nof the Caddo Parish School Board during 1975 and 1976, Jones v.\nCaddo Parish School Board, supra, 704 F.2d at 220 n. 22, she surely\nknew of the decree, its operation and the dormancy of any attempts\nto alter it.\nPhillips contends that her interest was represented until\nMay 1981 when the United States and the Board signed a second\nconsent decree, yet, that decree served Phillips' interest more\nfully than the 1973 decree by reducing the number of one-race\nschools from 34 to 15. Indeed, Phillips does not contend that her\ninterest was served less well by the 1981 decree than by the 1973\n\n- 21 -\ndecree. It is simply not possible that her interest was adequately\nrepresented by the 1973 decree but not by the 1981 decree.\nEven if this Court should conclude that Phillips' interest\nwas adequately represented until 1981, it should hold that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in finding her inter-\nvention untimely. In her first supplemental motion to intervene,\nPhillips acknowledged that she had met with government counsel\nregarding the case. She also found it significant that the attorney\nwith whom she had met was replaced on the case in November 1980 and\nthat the new attorney had principal responsibility for representing\nthe United States in the negotiations.\nMoreover, a series of well-publicized public meetings were\nheld from February through April regarding the course of the negotia-\ntions. Thus, the community was aware of the negotiations and that\nthe parties were moving toward a consent decree. Yet, in spite of\nher concern about the change in government counsel, and her awareness\nthat a consent decree was imminent, she did not seek intervention\nin the case until four days after expiration of the period for\nobjecting to the consent decree. Her delay in moving to protect\nher interest allowed the United States and the Board to expend\nconsiderable time, effort and resources in the belief that they\nwere the only parties to the litigation.\nThe effect of this delay was exacerbated by the failure of\nPhillips or any other member of the class that she now seeks to\n\n€(cid:9) !(cid:9) ._.\n- 22 -\nrepresent to respond to the express invitation of the district\ncourt in June 1980 to reenter the case. This failure to come\nforward allowed the United States and the Board to believe that\nthey were the sole persons interested in participating in this\nlitigation.\nPhillips, has failed to offer any plausible explanation for\n8/(cid:9) 9/\nher delay between 1974(cid:9) and 1981.(cid:9) Because the burden of establish-\ning timeliness was hers, this failure is fatal to her motion to\nintervene. Indeed, a similar unexplained lapse proved fatal to\nwould-be intervenors in United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314\n(5th Cir. 1982). This Court held that a four year delay was untimely\non its face and a hearing was not necessary. Similarly, Phillips\nmotion is untimely on its face and fails to raise any issue of\nfact necessitating a hearing. See also, United States v. Perry\nCounty Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277, 280 (5th Cir. 1978).\n2. Prejudice to the parties\nAlthough Phillips' motion is untimely on its face, examination\nof the remaining Stallworth factors enforces the correctness of the\n8/ We will assume for argument sake that her interest was ade-\nquately represented until 1974 when the would-be intervenors failed\nto pursue a hearing in the district court.\n9/ From 1974 to 1978, nobody sought to challenge the 1973 decree\non the basis that it contemplated allowing 34 one-race schools. The\nCitizens' Advisory Committee letter of July 20, 1976 and the responses\nof the United States and William Jefferson to the Board's 1976 motion\nto dismiss all complained that the 1973 decree had been implemented\ninadquately and not that the decree, itself, was inadequate.\n\n- 23 -\ndistrict court's denial of her intervention. The prejudice that\nPhillips' delay from 1974 to 1981 caused the United States and the\nBoard is extensive. By failing to step forward until after final\njudgment, Phillips has allowed the United States and the Board to\nexpend considerable time, resources and effort settling this litiga-\ntion in the belief that they adequately represented all interests\nramaining in the litigation. Granting Phillips intervention would\nhave erased all of this effort and required the parties to litigate\nthe United States' 1978 motion to amend the declaration of unitari-\nness. Although the United States is confident that its motion was\nwelltaken and would have been granted, the outcome of any litigation\nis uncertain (infra p. 31). Thus, at best, granting intervention\nwould have delayed adoption of a final desegregation plan and\npostponed a desegregated education for thousands of children in\nthe Caddo Parish School system.\n3. Prejudice to Ms. Phillips\nThe prejudice to Phillips resulting from denial of her motion\nto intervene is amorphous at best. Phillips' sole remaining contention\nregarding the inadequacy of the consent decree is that it allows\ntoo many one-race schools (Br. 7-8). She cannot and does not\ncontest, however, that far more one-race schools were operated\nunder the 1973 consent decree, which she did not challenge. There-\nfore, her interest in the elimination of one-race schools is served,\nrather than prejudiced, by the 1981 decree.\n\n- 24 -\nMoreover, she remains free, after denial of her motion to\nintervene, to pursue a separate lawsuit alleging that the school\n10/\nsystem is unconstitutionally segregated.(cid:9) The survival of alterna-\ntive avenues of redress is a principal factor mitigating prejudice\ncaused by denial of a motion to intervene. United States v. Louisiana,\n90 F.R.D. 358 359 (E.D. La. 1981) (three-judge court).\n10/ We adhere to, although we do not repeat, the argument in our\nopening brief, adopted by the panel, that this was not a class\naction. As a consequence, the judgment is not res judicata with\nregard to anyone but the two parties -- the United States and the\nSchool Board. See General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318\n(1980). This Court has frequently suggested that the proper way\nfor parental groups to complain about a desegregation decree is to\nintervene in the ongoing action and not to file a separate lawsuit.\nE.g., Hines v. Rapides Parish, supra; Pate v. Dade County, supra.\nThis rule, however, has been announced in situations in which\nparental groups sought to challenge the operation of the decree\nitself and, generally, to oppose steps toward desegregation. See,\ne.g., Pate v. Dade County, supra; United States v. Perry County,\nsupra. If Phillips were to file a separate lawsuit, we assume\nthat her allegation would be that the decree, while it has achieved\nsome desegregation, has left parts of the system unconstitutionally\nsegregated. She would, therefore, not be alleging that the decree,\nitself, has ordered some unlawful conduct, but that problems not\naddressed by the decree must be remedied. Similarly, her suit\nwould not be barred by the doctrine that a consent decree may not\nbe attacked in a collateral proceeding. See Thaggard v. City of\nJackson, 687 F.2d 66 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, sub nom. Ashley\nv. City of Jackson, No. 82-1390 (Oct. 11, 1983). This Court's\ndecision in Thaggard, supra, illustrates our point. The white\nplaintiffs in Thaggard alleged that the consent decrees in that\ncase, which established hiring and promotion goals for blacks,\nresulted in reverse discrimination against them. Thus, their\nallegation was that the decrees, themselves, mandated illegal\nconduct. Their suits were dismissed as impermissible collateral\nattacks on the decrees. Phillips, by contrast, would be permitted\nto allege not that the consent decree, itself, produced segregation\nof the system, but that parts of the system require further desegre-\ngation.\n\n- 25 -\nFinally, the unusual circumstances of this case militate\nstrongly against granting intervention. The unusually long delay\nof Ms. Phillips in filing her motion to intervene and the numerous\nopportunities for her to participate over the course of this 18\nyear old lawsuit weigh strongly against allowing her to intervene.\nMoreover, this is a school desegregation case, where \"voluntary\nresolution is preferable to full litigation because the spirit of\ncooperation inherent in good faith settlement is essential to the\ntrue long-range success of any desegregation remedy.\" Armstrong\nv. Board of School Directors, 616 F.2d 305, 318 (7th Cir. 1980).\nAllowing intervention after a consent decree has been negotiated\nand entered would greatly disrupt and deter the voluntary settlement\nprocess that plays a uniquely significant role in school desegrega-\ntion litigation. The district court correctly denied Phillips'\n11/\nmotion as untimely.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED MS. PHILLIPS' MOTION TO\nINTERVENE BECAUSE HER INTEREST\nWAS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED BY\nTHE UNITED STATES\nThe limitation on intervention in Rule 24(a)(2) that excludes\nindividuals whose interests are already adequately represented is\ndesigned \"to prevent litigation from becoming hopelessly complex.\"\nUnited States v. South Bend Community School Corporation, supra,\n11/ Phillips' untimeliness also prevents her permissive intervention.\nUnited States v. Marion County School District, supra, at 148.\n\n- 26 -\n710 F.2d at 396. The Rule is designed to ensure that everyone whose\ninterest may be adversely affected by litigation has a represen-\ntative in the action. Rule 24(a)(2), therefore, is expressly\ndesigned not to allow every person with an interest to intervene.\nThe first step in determining whether an individual's interest\nis adequately represented is to define the interests of both the\nwould-be intervenor and the purported representative. This Court\nhas repeatedly stated that the only interest justifying intervention\nin a school desegregation case is that of furthering the goal of\ndismantling a dual school system in accordance with the law. Pate\nv. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501, 503 (1979); United\nStates v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277 (1978).\nIn addition, this court has consistently construed the interest\nrequirement of Rule 24(a)(2) narrowly, emphasizing in Diaz v.\nSouthern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d 1118, 1124 (5th Cir.) cert.\ndenied, 400 U.S. 878 (1970) that\nintervention still requires a\n\"direct, substantial, legally\nprotectable interest in the\nproceedings.\"\nSee also, United States v. Perry County Board of Education, supra,\n567 F.2d at 279.\nAs a result of this narrow construction of the term\n\"interest,\" groups that simply disagree with a tactical decision of\na party to the litigation or a policy decision made by a public body\nrepresenting the interest of a would-be intervenor have been denied\n\n- 27 -\nintervention of right and have, at most, been afforded permissive\nintervention. Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762,\n763 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Perry County Board of Education,\nsupra, 567 F.2d at 279; Pate v. Dade County School Board, supra,\n588 F.2d at 503.\nAlthough the United States does not contend that Phillips has\nfailed to satisfy the interest requirement, this Court's limited\nview narrows the purposes for which she may intervene and helps to\ndefine the role of the United States as her representative for\npurposes of Rule 24(a)(2). Her sole interest can be in eliminating\nthe dual school system. This interest is identical to that of the\nUnited States, which intervened in this suit pursuant to Title IX\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2. This statute\nempowers the United States to intervene in actions alleging violations\nof the equal protection clause.\nBecause the interests of the United States and Phillips are\nidentical, the inquiry must focus on the adequacy of the United\nStates' representation of the joint interest in achieving a unitary\nschool system. To demonstrate inadequate representation, Phillips\nmust show that the United States colluded with an opposing party,\nhad an interest adverse to hers, or failed to act competently in\nthe fulfillment of its duty of representation. Martin v. Kalvar\nCorp., 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th Cir. 1969).\nIn establishing that the United States' representation has\nbeen inadequate, Phillips must overcome the presumption of adequate\n\n- 28 -\nrepresentation that arises when an applicant for intervention \"has\nthe same ultimate objective as a party to the existing suit.\"\nUnited States Postal Service v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191 (2d Cir.\n1978). Moreover, it requires a very strong showing to demonstrate\nthat representation of the public interest by the United States in\na school desegregation case is inadequate. See United States v.\nBoard of School Commissioners of Indianapolis, 466 F.2d 573 (7th\nCir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 909 (1973); United States v.\nBoard of Education of the City of Chicago, 88 F.R.D. 679, 686\n(N.D. Ill. 1981).\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to Phillips' allega-\ntion that the United States failed adequately to represent her\ninterest. We do not understand Phillips to contend that the United\nStates colluded with the School Board or represented an interest\n12/\nthat was actually adverse to hers(cid:9) Any suggestion of collusion\nbetween the United States and the Board would be frivolous on its\nface in view of the history of arduous negotiations over the period\nof nearly a year that produced the consent decree. Thus, Phillips'\ncontentions boil down to an assertion that the United States failed\nto advocate adequately the interest in a unitary school system.\n12/ Phillips does suggest (Br. 10-12) that the consent decree was,\nin part, the result of a meeting between the United States Attorney\nfor the Western District of Louisiana, J. Ransdell Keene, and\nofficials of the Civil Rights Division. Certainly, however, it\nwas proper for officials of the Department of Justice to speak with\nthe Department's representative in western Louisiana. Both before\nand after this meeting, the negotiations for the United States were\nconducted exclusively by attorneys from the Civil Rights Division.\n(Continued)\n\n- 29 -\nIn determining whether the United States adequately repre-\nsented the interest in dismantling the dual school system, this\nCourt should remain mindful that it is reviewing a consent decree.\nAs stated in Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977):\n[C]ompromise is the essence of\na settlement. The trial court\nshould not make a proponent of\na proposed settlement \"justify\neach term of a settlement\nagainst a hypothetical or\nspeculative measure of what\nconcessions might have been\ngained; inherent in compromise\nis a yielding of absolutes and\nan abandoning of highest hopes.\"\nBecause of the \"overriding public interest in * * * [the] settlement\"\nof litigation, id. at 1331, courts must be reluctant to upset the\ndelicate balance that a settlement represents and should limit\ntheir inquiry into a consent decree negotiated by the United States\nto whether the district court abused its discretion in determining\nthat the settlement is lawful, reasonable, constitutional and in\naccord with public policy. United States v. City of Miami, 664\nF.2d 435, 439-442 (5th Cir. 1981) (en banc); United States v. City\nof Alexandria, 614 F.2d 1358, 1361 (5th Cir. 1980); Armstrong v.\n12/ (Continued)\nMoreover, any suggestion that the Department collapsed under pressure\nfrom the United States Attorney is belied by the timing of events.\nThe meeting between Mr. Keene and members of the Civil Rights\nDivision occurred on March 16, 1981, but agreement was not reached\nbetween the United States and the School Board until nearly two\nmonths later, after intensive and continuous negotiation.\n\n- 30 -\nBoard of School Directors of the City of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305\n(7th Cir. 1980).\nIndeed, one of the most significant characteristics of a\nconsent decree is that\n[i]t is not the result of\na judicial determination\nafter the annealment of the\nadversary process and a judge's\nreflection about the ultimate\nmerits of conflicting claims.\nIt does not determine right and\nwrong in the initial dispute.\nUnited States v. City of Miami, supra, 664 F.2d at 440. In\napproving a consent decree, a court does not \"reach any ultimate\nconclusions on the issues of fact and law which underlie the merits\nof the dispute,\" Cotton v. Hinton, supra, 559 F.2d at 1330, since\na settlement is\na process of compromise in\nwhich, \"in exchange for the\nsaving of cost and elimination\nof risk, the parties each give\nup something they might have won\nhad they proceeded with the\nlitigation,\" United States v.\nArmour & Co., 402 U.S. 673,\n682 * * * rather than an attempt\nto precisely delineate legal rights.\"\nUnited States v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d 1147, 1152 (5th Cir.\n1975). See also, United States v. Texas Education Agency (Port\nArthur Independent School District), 679 F.2d 1104 (5th Cir.\n1982). A consent decree, therefore, may reflect each party's\nuncertainty regarding its liability or entitlement to relief.\n\n- 31 -\nThe preamble to the consent decree reflects the calculations\nof both parties. The United States had contended in its 1978\nmotion to amend the judgment of unitariness that even though it\nhad not objected to the 1973 decree, it had reserved its right to\nseek further desegregation. The Board countered that the 1973\nconsent decree embodied a final, binding plan. It argued further\nthat if the United States withdrew from the agreement, the Board\nwould be relieved of all obligations under the plan (R. 2549).\nThus, the United States could not be certain that trial of\nits motion to amend the judgment of unitariness would produce any\nfurther desegregation of the system. The further desegregation of\nthe system accomplished by the 1981 consent decree however, is\nsubstantial and good faith implementation of the measures required\nunder the 1981 decree will achieve a unitary school system. As\ndiscussed (supra, p. 6), it has already reduced the number of\none-race schools from 34 to 15 and has reduced the number of\nchildren in one-race schools from nearly 20,000 to approximately\n11,000. Moreover, further desegregation is expected as the newly\nconstructed Huntington School opens and the voluntary transfer and\n13/\nmagnet programs achieve full impact.\n13/ We note numerous omissions and distortions in Phillips'\ndiscussion of the impact of the consent decree. First, she does\nnot acknowledge that the decree's effect is not complete, as\ndescribed above. In addition, she inflates the number of children\nin one-race schools by adding pre-school children who attend\nneighborhood early childhood centers. These centers, ironically,\nanswer in part, Ms. Phillips' original objection to the consent\ndecree. Further, she distorts the facts regarding the magnet\n(Continued)\n\n- 32 -\nIn view of the amount of desegregation achieved by the\ndecree, Phillips' contention that the United States was not\nconcerned about providing a desegregated education for children\nin Caddo Parish is plainly false. The consent decree negotiated\nby the United States is clearly a sufficient desegregation remedy\nthat reflects not only adequate but vigorous representation of\nPhillips' interest.\nShe argues that the United States abandoned its concern\nregarding one-race schools, yet the United States has eliminated\n19 of 34 one-race schools through negotiation of the decree.\nRegarding the continued existence of some one-race schools, the\ndistrict court correctly found (supra, p. 9) that desegregation\nof these schools was impractical because of the geographic isolation\nof schools in the Cooper Road area and the adverse effect on surround-\ning desegregated schools of efforts to transfer students into or\nout of this area. The court further stressed the special educational\nenhancement programs to be placed in these one-race schools and the\navailability to these students of voluntary transfers to magnet\nschools and the system-wide majority-to-minority transfer provision\n(R. 3029).\n13/ (Continued)\nschools. In the three magnet schools that she discusses (Br. 5-6),\nall black applicants have been accepted. With one exception, the\nremainder of the eight magnet schools are clos e to 50% white and\n50% black. The exception is Herndon, which is in its first year of\noperation, but already has a 33% black and 66% white student popula-\ntion.\n\n- 33 -\nNo further findings by the district court were required by\nTasby V. Estes, 572 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. dismissed\nsub nom. Estes v. Metropolitan Branches, Dallas NAACP, 444 U.S.\n437 (1980), or Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 616 F.2d 805\n(5th Cir. 1980). Tasby required the district court to make findings\nregarding the feasibility of employing the desegregation tools\napproved in Swann v. Charlotte - Mecklenburg Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1 (1971), before adopting a plan that included a large\nnumber of one-race schools. Tasby involved a plan that was adopted\nafter full litigation of factual and legal issues. The United States\nand the Board chose in the present case to by-pass the portion of\nthe litigation that this Court found inadequate in Tasby. To require\nthe parties to litigate issues in accordance with Tasby would dis-\nregard the parties right to compromise their lawsuit and disserve\nthe public interest in settling litigation. See Armstrong v. Board\nof School Directors of the City of Milwaukee, supra, 616 F.2d at\n321. Thus, a consent decree may only be disapproved if it authorizes\na practice that is clearly illegal or unconstitutional as a general\nrule. Id. at 321-322. Because Tasby mandates a case-by-case\napproach to one-race schools, rather than a blanket prohibition\nagainst them, the district court properly did not reject the consent\ndecree on the basis of Tasby, nor could it conclude, based on Tasby,\nthat the United States failed to represent adequately the interest\n\n- 34 -\n14/\nin a desegregated school system.(cid:9) For identical reasons, Phillips'\nreliance on Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education, 687\nF.2d 814 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 51 U.S.L.W. 3553 (U.S. Jan.\n25, 1983), is also misplaced.\nPhillips' contention (Br. 8) that Lee v. Macon County Board\nof Education, supra, mandates a holding that the United States'\nrepresentation was inadequate is also incorrect. In Lee, this Court\nheld that the district court's findings were insufficient to justify\na plan under which two-thirds of the elementary grade black students\nin the system would remain in schools over 95 percent black. A far\nsmaller percentage of black students remain in one-race schools\nunder this decree. In addition, Lee did not involve a consent\ndecree. Moreover, this Court reaffirmed, id. at 809:\nClearly, the existence of a\nfew one-race schools does\nnot in itself offend the\nconstitution.\nIndeed, this Court has found that a number of school systems\nare unitary after full implemtation of a desegregation remedy\ndespite the presence of numerous one-race schools. See e.a., Ross\nv. Houston Independent School District, 699 F.2d 218 (5th Cir. 1983);\nCalhoun v. Cook, 522 F.2d 717 (5th Cir.); reh'g denied. 525 F.2d 1203\n14/ Indeed, acceptance of an argument that a consent decree could\nnot permit one-race schools without Tasby findings would amount to\na rule that a school desegregation consent decree could never permit\none-race schools.\n\n- 35 -\n(1975) (per curiam); Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\n537 F.2d 800 (5th Cir. 1976).\nIt is therefore clear that the consent decree's desegregation\nplan was constitutionally acceptable and, a fortiori, the United\nStates' representation of Phillips' interest in desegregating the\nparish schools was adequate.\nIn sum, Phillips has failed to carry her burden of alleging\nfacts that could, if true, amount to the required \"very compelling\nshowing that representation of the public interest by the United\nStates is not adequate * * * •\" United States v. Board of Education,\nsupra, 88 F.R.D. at 686. The district court, therefore, properly\n15/\ndenied, without a hearing, Phillips' motion to intervene.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the appeal should be dismissed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

JONES, et al.,\nPlaintiffs\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Intervenor-Appellee\nJUNE PHILLIPS,\nApplicant for Intervention-Appellant\nV.\nCADDO PARISH SCHOOL BOARD, et al.,\nDefendants-Appellees\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES ON REHEARING EN BANC\nSTATEMENT REGARDING JURISDICTION\nBecause the district court properly denied the motion to\nintervene, this Court does not have jurisdiction and the appeal\nshould be dismissed. Weiser v. White, 505 F.2d 912 (5th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 421 U.S. 993 (1975).\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nWhether the district court properly denied June Phillips'\nmotion to intervene to challenge the consent decree negotiated by\nthe United States and the School Board in this school desegregation\ncase.\nSTATEMENT\nBecause the opening brief and the majority and dissenting\nopinions of the panel recite the history of this litigation in\n\ndetail, this statement will address only those facts essential to\nthe United States' arguments.\nA. Facts\nThis school desegregation action was filed in 1965 by plain-\ntiffs purporting to represent a class of black parents and students\n1/\nin Caddo Parish (R. 1).(cid:9) This Court sanctioned the United States'\nintervention in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\n372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), aff'd 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.) (en\nbanc), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 840 (1967).\nPlans to desegregate the Caddo Parish School system have been\ndisapproved in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nsu ra; Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 417 F.2d 801 (5th\nCir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 904 (1969), and Jones v. Caddo Parish\nSchool Board, 421 F.2d 313 (5th Cir. 1970).\nOn June 1, 1973, a bi-racial committee appointed by the\ndistrict court filed with the court a plan to desegregate the school\nsystem. The private plaintiffs initially filed objections to the\nplan. Shortly thereafter, original counsel for the plaintiffs,\nJesse Stone, moved to strike as counsel lawyers from the NAACP Legal\nDefense Fund because of their objections to the plan and to substi-\ntute Murphy Bell as counsel for the plaintiffs. This motion was\ngranted on July 13, 1973. The United States noted that the plan\nwould leave intact some 34 one-race schools, but concluded: \"The\npresent posture of this law suit considered, the United States\nof America, intervenor herein, interjects no objection to ordering\nimplementation of this plan.\"(cid:9) Upon motion of plaintiffs' new\n1/ \"R.\" references are to the record.\n\n-3-\ncounsel, the district court then struck the objections to the\nplan and on July 20, 1973, ordered implementation of the consent\ndecree. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914\n(5th Cir. 1974).\nApproximately four months later, lawyers from the NAACP\nLegal Defense Fund filed a motion to intervene on behalf of a class\nof black students in Caddo Parish together with a complaint\nchallenging the constitutionality of the desegregation plan.\nAfter the district court held that the motion was untimely and the\nintervenors were already adequately represented, this Court remanded\nthe case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the\nmotion to intervene. Ibid. On remand, no hearing was requested\nor held.\nOn July 20, 1976, the Citizens Advisory Committee, appointed\nto monitor implementation of the plan, reported on several deficien-\ncies in the Board's implementation. The district court appointed a\nspecial master to investigate and report on progress under the plan.\nIn September 1976, the Board filed a motion to have the\nsystem declared unitary and the action dismissed. In October 1977,\nthe United States opposed the motion as premature since the\nspecial master had yet to report and noted several deficiencies in\nthe implementation of the 1973 decree. Plaintiffs, through counsel\nWilliam Jefferson, also filed a memorandum in opposition to the\nBoard's motion, noting shortcomings in the Board's implementation\nof the 1973 plan. This was the only paper filed by plaintiffs\nbetween 1974 and the present. On December 30, 1977, the district\ncourt declared the system unitary and dismissed the action (R. 2442).\n\n-4-\nThe United States, relying for the first time on the ground\nthat the 1973 decree had allowed too many one-race schools, moved\nto amend the district court's judgment (R. 2443), but none of the\noriginal plaintiffs either appealed or moved to amend the judgment.\nA year and a half later, on June 30, 1980, the district court\nentered a minute order, stating in part (R. 2510):\nIf the original plaintiffs still have a viable\ninterest in this case, their counsel should contact\nthe court, in writing, within thirty (30) days of\nthis order. If the plaintiffs' counsel does not\nrespond, this Court will consider that the plaintiffs\nacquiesce in having their interests represented by the\nUnited States as plaintiff-intervenor.\nThis notice was sent to all past and present counsel of record.\nNo representative came forward (R. 2993).\nDuring this period, the United States and the Board entered\nnegotiations to resolve the issues raised by the United States'\nmotion to amend the judgment of unitariness. At no point during\nthese negotiations did anyone purporting to represent private\nplaintiffs attempt to participate in the negotiations. During\nFebruary, March and April 1981, when the decree was taking shape,\nnumerous public meetings were held (R. 2883, 2827). The negotia-\ntions concluded on May 5, 1981, with the signing by the United\nStates and the Board of a settlement agreement. Two days later,\nin response to the joint motion of the parties, the district\ncourt entered the agreement (R. 2584, 2606). The court ordered\n\n4(cid:9) n\n..•..(cid:9) •. ^..__a ......_w J-J.(cid:9) -. . f4(cid:9) .J.Y.s..(cid:9) .a .w<_.. t.l ..._.(cid:9) a..(cid:9) Y ^. •.._(cid:9) 5. .. .(cid:9) .

The decree was published\nin two local newspapers and was reported by three local television\nstations.\nBy the close of the ten day period, thirteen objections had\nbeen received, including one from Ms. Phillips who argued that the\ndecree failed to provide enrichment programs for black students\n(R. 2656). On May 22,,1981, four days after expiration of the\nperiod for objections, Phillips filed a motion to intervene\nindividually and on behalf of a class of black students (R. 2724).\nIn this motion she raised for the first time her complaint that\nthe decree left too many black students in one-race schools. On\nMay 27 and June 8, she filed supplemental motions to intervene\n(R. 2763, 2812). Also on June 8, the United States and the\nBoard each filed memoranda opposing Phillips' motion to intervene\n(R. 2825, 2891).\nOn June 17, 1981, the district court denied the motions to\nintervene and on July 2, 1981, it overruled all objections to the\nconsent decree and ordered its implementation (R. 3026, 3038).\nOn July 16, Phillips filed a notice of appeal from the order of\nJune 17, denying her motion to intervene and from the order of\nJuly 2, overruling her objections to the consent decree (R. 3078).\nOn May 6, 1983, a divided panel of this Court dismissed\nPhillips' appeal, holding that the district court had not abused\n\n- 6 -\nits discretion in finding her motion to intervene untimely. On\nOctober 11, 1983, this Court ordered rehearing of the case en banc.\n1. The consent decree and motion to intervene\nThe consent decree, signed by the district court on May 7,\n1981, dealt comprehensively with the desegregation of the Caddo\nParish schools. It contemplated reduction of the number of one-\nrace schools in the system from thirty-three to fourteen (R. 2912).\nIn fact, the number of one-race schools has now been reduced to\nfifteen. It promised to reduce the number of whites attending\none-race schools from 5,831 to 945 and the number of black\nstudents in such schools from 14,054 to 8,975 (ibid.). The\nfigures for September 1983, show that 327 whites and approximately\n2/\n11,000 blacks remain in one-race schools.\nThe consent decree ordered the Roard to undertake a variety\nof remedies to promote the interrelated goals of desegregation\nand enhanced quality of education. These remedies include majority-\nto-minority transfers, attendance zone changes and student reassign-\nments, school closings and new construction, and the development\n2/ Part of the discrepancy between the projected and actual\nnumber of blacks in one-race schools is attributable to the\nconversion through demographic changes of Fair Park High School\nfrom a predominantly white to a predominantly black school.\nThis adds 1352 black students to this statistic. In addition,\nthe complete effect of the decree cannot be measured until various\neducational enhancement and voluntary transfer programs have had\nan opportunity to work. Furthermore, there has been a one year\ndelay in construction of the Huntington School, which was slated\nto open in 1983, but is now scheduled to open in 1984.\n\n-7-\nof seven magnet schools and one laboratory school and special\neducational programs. The decree established a timetable for\nimplementation beginning in the autumn of 1981 with the\nestablishment of magnet schools and concluding in 1983-1984\nwith the opening of the new Huntington School. (R. 2576).\nIn her motions to intervene, Phillips contended that the\nconsent decree failed to require special programs at the all-black\nschools that would remain under the decree, allowed the survival\nof too many one-race schools, failed generally to promote desegre-\ngation of the system, placed an undue burden on black students by\nrequiring various attendance zone changes, and limited admissions\nto magnet and laboratory schools. She also contended that notice\nshould have been given before entry of the decree to the class\nthat she sought to represent.\n2. The district court's decisions\nPhillips has appealed from two orders of the district court;\nthe first of June 17, 1981, denying her motion to intervene and the\nsecond of July 2, 1981, overruling her objections to the consent\ndecree.\n\n-8-\nWith regard to Phillips' motion to intervene, the district\ncourt concluded that she had failed to satisfy the timeliness\nrequirement of Rule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., and had failed to\ncarry her burden of demonstrating that the United States had not\nrepresented her interests adequately. On the matter of timeliness,\nthe court recounted that Phillips had not filed a motion to inter-\nvene or otherwise opposed the 1973 consent decree, had not responded\nto the minute entry of June 3, 1980, and had not sought intervention\nduring the highly publicized negotiations conducted by the United\nStates and the Board from February to May 1981. The court concluded\nthat Phillips sought to\nsubstitute her judgment for the considered\nopinion of the * * * School Board, The\nDepartment oaf Justice and this court that\nthe Consent Decree will constitutionally\ndesegregate the Caddo Parish School system.\nShe asks that the court allow her to second\nguess the months of turmoil and negotiations\ncarried on by the parties, after she took no\nsteps to participate in that process. This\nthe court cannot allow.(cid:9) (R. 2936).\nThe district court also concluded that Phillips had failed\nto establish that her interests had not been represented adequately\nby the parties to the settlement (ibid.). Relying on Hines v.\nRapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762 (5th Cir. 1973) and Pate\nv. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,\n444 U.S. 835 (1979), the court concluded that the issues presented\n\n-9-\nby Phillips had all been considered and addressed by the United\nStates and the Board and that, as a result, there remained no issue\nthat Phillips could best represent. The court then addressed\nseparately the issues of special programs, magnet schools, zone\nchanges, one-race schools and the burden that the decree placed on\nblack students and concluded that Phillips' contentions with regard\nto each lacked merit (R. 2937-2941).\nIn the same memorandum, the court rejected Phillips' conten-\ntion that this was a class action requiring notice to the class\nbefore a decree could be entered (R. 2939). The court held that a\nclass was never certified and that the United States had never been\ncertified as a class representative, nor purported to act as such.\nThe court also concluded that the attention and publicity attending\nthe negotiation of the consent decree were sufficient to alert all\ninterested parties to the terms of the decree (ibid.).\nFinally, the court disposed of Phillips' contention that\nshe was entitled to a hearing under Calhoun v. Cook, 487 F.2d 680\n(5th Cir. 1973). The court distinguished Calhoun as a case in\nwhich there was a dispute whether all parties to the suit had agreed\nto the settlement. The court found no doubt that the United States\nand the Board had reached a settlement (ibid.).\nPhillips also appeals from the July 2, 1981 order rejecting\nher objections to the consent decree. In a memorandum opinion\nissued that same date, the district court discussed the thirteen\n\n- 10 -\nobjections to the decree, including those of Phillips. The court\ncharacterized Phillips' objections as focusing on the decree's lack\nof specificity regarding educational enhancement programs and the\nfailure to provide for pre-school educational programs. The court\nfound that the decree made ample provision for educational enhance-\nment programs and that Phillips' concern regarding preschool\nprograms, while legitimate, did not allege any failure to desegre-\ngate the system (R. 3026).\n3. The Hanel decision\nOn May 6, 1983, a divided panel of this Court dismissed\nPhillips' appeal. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 704 F.2d\n206. The majority held that the lawsuit was not a class action\nand could, therefore, be settled by the United States and the\nBoard, as the sole remaining parties. It further held that\nPhillips' motion to intervene was properly denied without a\nhearing as untimely. The panel majority reasoned that Ms.\nPhillips could not remain silent through 16 years of litigation\nbefore seeking intervention some 15 days after entry of a consent\ndecree. The majority noted, id. at 218, that Phillips' motion\nto intervene attacked the 1973 decree, yet she waited 8 years\nto raise this objection. The majority also found significant\nthat Phillips failed to challenge the 1977 declaration that the\nsystem was unitary and she did not seek to intervene while the\nUnited States and the Board conducted well-publicized negotiations,\n\n- 11 -\nincluding meetings with the community, in early 1981. Ibid.\nThe majority concluded that because of her active role in the\neducational affairs of Caddo Parish, Phillips was aware of her\ninterest in this case long before she sought to intervene. The\nmajority concluded that Phillips' great and unexplained delay\nmade her motion to intervene prima facie untimely. Id. at 222.\nIn addition, the majority held that because this is not a class\naction, Phillips is not prevented by principles of res judicata\nfrom bringing a separate lawsuit. Id. at 217.\nJudge Goldberg, in dissent, disagreed with the majority\nthat untimeliness could be determined in this case without a\nhearing. He argued that timeliness under Rule 24(a)(2) must be\nmeasured from the point at which the representation of the inter-\nvenor's interest by existing parties became inadequate.\nJudge Goldberg found that Phillips had alleged facts that,\nif true, showed that she had a greater and therefore distinct\ninterest in a desegregated school system that was not adequately\nrepresented by the United States in negotiating the 1981 consent\ndecree. He concluded that a hearing was necessary to determine\nwhether Phillips could reasonably have known prior to publica-\ntion of the 1981 consent decree that her interest was not adequately\nrepresented.\n\n- 12 -\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in finding\nPhillips' motion to intervene untimely on its face. Phillips'\nmotion to intervene, which was filed over two weeks after the\nUnited States and the School Board presented a proposed consent\ndecree to the district court, alleged that the United States had\nfailed to represent adequately her interest in eliminating one-\nrace schools. Her allegation, however, addressed segregation that\nsurvived the 1973 consent decree between the private plaintiffs\nand the Board, to which the United States did not object. Phillips'\ncontention, therefore, actually amounts to an allegation that the\nUnited States' representation first became inadequate in 1973 when\nit failed to object to the consent decree that left 34 one-race\nschools.\nBecause the United States agrees that timeliness under Rule\n24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., must be measured from the date that the\nalleged inadequacy of representation first arose, United Airlines,\nInc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977), Phillips' motion was properly\nfound untimely on its face. United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d\n314 (5th Cir. 1982). Moreover, even if timeliness is measured\nfrom some later point in the litigation, Phillips' unexplained delay\nremains inexcusable. Although she was aware of the United States'\nand the Board's well-publicized efforts to produce a consent decree,\nshe failed to move for intervention until four days after expiration\nof the period for objecting to the decree.\n\n- 13 -\nApplication of the factors for measuring timeliness\narticulated by this Court in Stallworth v. Monsanto, 558 F.2d 257\n(1977), confirms that the district court correctly denied Phillips'\nmotion. The United States and the Board would suffer substantial\nprejudice as a result of Phillips' delay. By failing to intervene\nin a timely fashion, Phillips permitted the United States and the\nBoard to expend time, resources and effort setting this litigation\nin the belief that they were the only interested parties remaining\nin the litigation. Granting her motion would have required the\nparties to litigate the United States' motion to amend the judgment\nof unitariness.\nPhillips, by contrast, has not suffered measurable prejudice\nby denial of her intervention. Her interest in eliminating one-\nrace schools was served by the 1981 decree, which has already\neliminated 19 one-race schools. In addition, because she was not\na party to the decree she remains free to file a separate lawsuit\nseeking further desegregation.\nThe district court also did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Phillips' intervention, since her interest was adequately\nrepresented by the United States which shared the same interest in\ndismantling the dual school system. The United States, therefore,\ncould only have failed to represent Phillips' interest if it\ncolluded with the School Board, represented an interest that was\nactually adverse to Phillips, or failed to perform adequately as\n\n- 14 -\na representative. Martin v. Kalvar Corp., 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th\nCir. 1969).\nPhillips' assertions boil down to a contention that the\nUnited States did not advocate adequately her interest in reducing\nthe number of one-race schools. The United States contends, how-\never, that by negotiating the elimination of 19 of the 34 one-race\nschools it fully represented Phillips' interest. The decree appears\neven more adequate in view of the fact that it is a consent decree\nthat properly reflects the parties' calculations regarding the\nrisks of litigation and embodies a compromise. See United States\nv. City of Miami, 664 F.2d 435 (5th Cir.) (en banc); Cotton v.\nHinton, 559 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir. 1977). Because Phillips failed to\nallege any facts that could, if true, make the compelling showing\nnecessary to establish inadequate representation by the United\nStates in a school desegregation case, the district court properly\ndenied her motion without a hearing.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY\nCONCLUDED THAT MS. PHILLIPS'\nMOTION TO INTERVENE WAS UNTIMELY\nMs. Phillips contends that the United States failed adequately\n3/\nto represent her interest in eliminating one-race schools.(cid:9) Her\nassertion comes too late to be heard by this Court. The United\n3/ The United States contends (infra, pp. 25-35) that it has repre-\nsented Phillips' interests adequately throughout this litigation.\n\nA\n15 -\n- \nStates took the position as early as 1973 that it would not object\nin this case to a consent decree that left some 34 one-race schools\nin the system. Under Rule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., timeliness\nmust he measured from the date that the alleged inadequacy \nof\nrepresentation first arose. Phillips' challenge to this alleged\nbreakdown in representation first surfaced, however, some eight\nyears later, and seven years after the failure of other potential\nclass representatives to pursue the hearing this Court directed\nthe district court to hold regarding the adequacy of the 1973\ndecree. In these circumstances, the district court's decision on\ntimeliness was plainly correct.\nRule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., requires that an intervenor\nseeking to intervene as of right has the burden of establishing\nthat (1) the application for intervention is timely; (2) the inter-\nvenor has an interest in the subject matter of the litigation; (3)\nthe applicant's ability to protect that interest may be impaired\nor impeded by the disposition of the action; and (4) the interest\nof the intervenor not be adequately represented by the existing\nparties. A deficient showing on any of these four requirements\nwill defeat intervention under Rule 24(a)(2). NAACP V. New York,\n413 U.S. 345, 369 (1973).\nA. The standard for determining timeliness\nThe timeliness of an application for intervention is an\nissue addressed to the discretion of the district court and \"is to\n\n- 16 -\nbe determined from all the circumstances.\" Id. at 366. Accordingly,\na determination of untimeliness can only be overturned if an abuse\nof discretion is shown. Ibid.\nThis Court's thoroughly analyzed the issue of timeliness\nunder Rule 24 in Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257 (1977).\nThat case, identified four factors to structure the inquiry into\ntimeliness (id. at 264-266):\n[1] The length of time during which\nthe would-be intervenor actually\nknew or reasonably should have\nknown of his interest in the case\nbefore he petitioned for leave to\nintervene.\n[2] The extent of the prejudice that\nthe existing parties to the liti-\ngation may suffer as a result of\nthe would-be intervenor's failure\nto apply for intervention as soon\nas he actually knew or reasonably\nshould have known of his interest\nin the case.\n[3] The extent of the prejudice that the\nwould-be intervenor may suffer if his\npetition for leave to intervene is\ndenied.\n[4] The existence of unusual circumstances\nmilitating either for or against a deter-\nmination that the application is timely.\n\n- 17 -\nThe first of these factors is seminal. It establishes the\nstarting point for application of the remaining factors by fixing\nthe point from which timeliness is to be measured. Stallworth\nrejects heavy reliance on absolute measures of timeliness, such as\nthe length of time the litigation has been pending and whether\njudgment has already been rendered and looks instead to when the\nwould-be intervenor learned or reasonably should have learned of\nhis interest in litigation. Id. at 266. As this Court has\nindicated since Stallworth, such absolute measures are relevant,\nbut they are not decisive. See United States v. Marion County\n4/\nSchool District, 590 F.2d 146, 149 (1979). What must be determined\nis when the applicant could reasonably have been expected to seek\nto intervene and the time that lapsed thereafter before intervention\nwas actually sought.\nIn some instances -- and this is one of them -- that threshold\ndetermination cannot be resolved without reference as well to the\nfourth criterion for intervention under Rule 24(a)(2) -- inadequacy\nof representation by existing parties. For, it cannot be gainsaid\nthat one's \"interest\" in participating directly in another's lawsuit\ncould well mature only after learning that the initial identity\nof interest in the subject matter had disintegrated and a different\nlegal viewpoint was being asserted by the litigating party.\n4/ Other courts of appeals have considered such absolute measures\ndecisive.(cid:9) See e.g., Pennsylvania v. Rizzo, 530 F.2d 501 (3d Cir.),\ncert. denied, 426 U.S. 921 (1976); United States v. South Bend\nCommunity School Corp., 710 F.2d 394, 395 (7th Cir. 1983).\n\n0\n- 18 -\nWhile Stallworth did not explicitly link timeliness to\nadequacy of representation, it noted, id. at 264, that the Supreme\nCourt in United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977),\nhad done so. In McDonald, the Supreme Court affirmed the holding\nof the Seventh Circuit that a member of a putative class, whose\nclass had been denied certification, timely filed a motion to\nintervene for purposes of pursuing an appeal to challenge the\ndenial of class certification. The motion to intervene was filed\n18 days after entry of final judgment. This was shortly after the\nwould-be intervenor learned that the named plaintiffs did not\nintend to appeal the denial of class certification. In affirming\nthe timeliness of the motion, the Court stated, id. at 394:\nIn short, as soon as it became\nclear to the respondent that the\ninterests of the unnamed class\nmembers would no longer be pro-\ntected by the named class repre-\nsentatives, she promptly moved to\nintervene to protect those interests.\n[Footnote omitted]\nAccord: Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306, 1321 (5th Cir.) cert.\ndenied, 449 U.S. 1011 (1980), where this Court, citing United\nAirlines, Inc. v. McDonald, supra, recognized that \"the question\nof timeliness is at least partially linked to the question of\n5/\nadequate representation.\"\n5/ This understanding of the linkage between timeliness and\nadequacy of representation is compelled by the logic of Rule\n24(a)(2). The Rule provides a mechanism for representation of the\ninterests of absentees that will be affected by the litigation.\nOn the other hand, the requirement that a would-be intervenor\ndemonstrate that no party in the litigation is adequately representing\n\n- 19 -\nB. Application of the timeliness standard\n1. Ms. Phillips reasonably should have known of the alleged\ninadequacy of representation since at least 1974.\nApplication of the foregoing principles to the present\ncase, demonstrates that Ms. Phillips' attempted intervention\n6/\nwas out of time. Taking Phillips' allegations at face value,\nrepresentation of the interest that she now seeks to assert --\nreduction of the number of one-race schools -- if it ever became\ninadequate, did so in 1974, at the latest. As described (supra,\npp. 2-3), the representatives of the class that Phillips seeks to\nrepresent signed a consent decree in 1973 that contemplated more\nthan twice the number of schools left one-race by the 1981 decree.\nThis number, Phillips concedes, included nearly all of the schools\nthat she now contends must not be allowed to remain one-race (Br.\n7/\n9-lO)T The United States, upon whom Phillips contends she relied\n5/ (Continued)\nhis interest discourages multiple representation and promotes\njudicial economy and efficiency. A rule that failed to link timeli-\nness to the requirement of inadequate representation would frustrate\nthis purpose and invite unnecessary applications for intervention.\nMoreover, such applications would be denied uniformly, since a\nwould-be intervenor cannot successfully apply for intervention until\nrepresentation becomes inadequate. It would make little sense to\nmeasure timeliness from a point at which a would-be intervenor could\nnot move successfully for intervention.\n6/ The United States contends (infra, pp. 31-32 n. 13) that many\nof Phillips' allegations are erroneous. For purposes of this first\nargument, however, we need not discuss those errors.\n7/ \"Br.\" references are to June Phillips' \"Fourth Supplemental\nBrief.\"\n\n- 20 -\nfor representation, did not object to the 1973 decree. Indeed, a\ngroup of attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund unsuccessfully\nsought intervention to challenge the 1973 decree in the district\ncourt. This Court remanded the case to the district court for a\nhearing on the motion to intervene, Jones v. Caddo Parish School\nBoard, 499 F.2d 914, (1974), but the intervenors never returned to\nthe district court. Ms. Phillips' claim of inadequate representa-\ntion (such as it is) thus ripened at that time and her efforts to\nintervene should have occurred then, or shortly thereafter -- and\nnot some seven years later.\nPhillips has not alleged, nor could she, that she was unaware\nof the 1973 decree or the fact that as of 1974 nobody was seeking\nto challenge the decree. As a parent with children in the school\nsystem during this period and as an educator who served as a member\nof the Caddo Parish School Board during 1975 and 1976, Jones v.\nCaddo Parish School Board, supra, 704 F.2d at 220 n. 22, she surely\nknew of the decree, its operation and the dormancy of any attempts\nto alter it.\nPhillips contends that her interest was represented until\nMay 1981 when the United States and the Board signed a second\nconsent decree, yet, that decree served Phillips' interest more\nfully than the 1973 decree by reducing the number of one-race\nschools from 34 to 15. Indeed, Phillips does not contend that her\ninterest was served less well by the 1981 decree than by the 1973\n\n- 21 -\ndecree. It is simply not possible that her interest was adequately\nrepresented by the 1973 decree but not by the 1981 decree.\nEven if this Court should conclude that Phillips' interest\nwas adequately represented until 1981, it should hold that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in finding her inter-\nvention untimely. In her first supplemental motion to intervene,\nPhillips acknowledged that she had met with government counsel\nregarding the case. She also found it significant that the attorney\nwith whom she had met was replaced on the case in November 1980 and\nthat the new attorney had principal responsibility for representing\nthe United States in the negotiations.\nMoreover, a series of well-publicized public meetings were\nheld from February through April regarding the course of the negotia-\ntions. Thus, the community was aware of the negotiations and that\nthe parties were moving toward a consent decree. Yet, in spite of\nher concern about the change in government counsel, and her awareness\nthat a consent decree was imminent, she did not seek intervention\nin the case until four days after expiration of the period for\nobjecting to the consent decree. Her delay in moving to protect\nher interest allowed the United States and the Board to expend\nconsiderable time, effort and resources in the belief that they\nwere the only parties to the litigation.\nThe effect of this delay was exacerbated by the failure of\nPhillips or any other member of the class that she now seeks to\n\n€(cid:9) !(cid:9) ._.\n- 22 -\nrepresent to respond to the express invitation of the district\ncourt in June 1980 to reenter the case. This failure to come\nforward allowed the United States and the Board to believe that\nthey were the sole persons interested in participating in this\nlitigation.\nPhillips, has failed to offer any plausible explanation for\n8/(cid:9) 9/\nher delay between 1974(cid:9) and 1981.(cid:9) Because the burden of establish-\ning timeliness was hers, this failure is fatal to her motion to\nintervene. Indeed, a similar unexplained lapse proved fatal to\nwould-be intervenors in United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314\n(5th Cir. 1982). This Court held that a four year delay was untimely\non its face and a hearing was not necessary. Similarly, Phillips\nmotion is untimely on its face and fails to raise any issue of\nfact necessitating a hearing. See also, United States v. Perry\nCounty Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277, 280 (5th Cir. 1978).\n2. Prejudice to the parties\nAlthough Phillips' motion is untimely on its face, examination\nof the remaining Stallworth factors enforces the correctness of the\n8/ We will assume for argument sake that her interest was ade-\nquately represented until 1974 when the would-be intervenors failed\nto pursue a hearing in the district court.\n9/ From 1974 to 1978, nobody sought to challenge the 1973 decree\non the basis that it contemplated allowing 34 one-race schools. The\nCitizens' Advisory Committee letter of July 20, 1976 and the responses\nof the United States and William Jefferson to the Board's 1976 motion\nto dismiss all complained that the 1973 decree had been implemented\ninadquately and not that the decree, itself, was inadequate.\n\n- 23 -\ndistrict court's denial of her intervention. The prejudice that\nPhillips' delay from 1974 to 1981 caused the United States and the\nBoard is extensive. By failing to step forward until after final\njudgment, Phillips has allowed the United States and the Board to\nexpend considerable time, resources and effort settling this litiga-\ntion in the belief that they adequately represented all interests\nramaining in the litigation. Granting Phillips intervention would\nhave erased all of this effort and required the parties to litigate\nthe United States' 1978 motion to amend the declaration of unitari-\nness. Although the United States is confident that its motion was\nwelltaken and would have been granted, the outcome of any litigation\nis uncertain (infra p. 31). Thus, at best, granting intervention\nwould have delayed adoption of a final desegregation plan and\npostponed a desegregated education for thousands of children in\nthe Caddo Parish School system.\n3. Prejudice to Ms. Phillips\nThe prejudice to Phillips resulting from denial of her motion\nto intervene is amorphous at best. Phillips' sole remaining contention\nregarding the inadequacy of the consent decree is that it allows\ntoo many one-race schools (Br. 7-8). She cannot and does not\ncontest, however, that far more one-race schools were operated\nunder the 1973 consent decree, which she did not challenge. There-\nfore, her interest in the elimination of one-race schools is served,\nrather than prejudiced, by the 1981 decree.\n\n- 24 -\nMoreover, she remains free, after denial of her motion to\nintervene, to pursue a separate lawsuit alleging that the school\n10/\nsystem is unconstitutionally segregated.(cid:9) The survival of alterna-\ntive avenues of redress is a principal factor mitigating prejudice\ncaused by denial of a motion to intervene. United States v. Louisiana,\n90 F.R.D. 358 359 (E.D. La. 1981) (three-judge court).\n10/ We adhere to, although we do not repeat, the argument in our\nopening brief, adopted by the panel, that this was not a class\naction. As a consequence, the judgment is not res judicata with\nregard to anyone but the two parties -- the United States and the\nSchool Board. See General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318\n(1980). This Court has frequently suggested that the proper way\nfor parental groups to complain about a desegregation decree is to\nintervene in the ongoing action and not to file a separate lawsuit.\nE.g., Hines v. Rapides Parish, supra; Pate v. Dade County, supra.\nThis rule, however, has been announced in situations in which\nparental groups sought to challenge the operation of the decree\nitself and, generally, to oppose steps toward desegregation. See,\ne.g., Pate v. Dade County, supra; United States v. Perry County,\nsupra. If Phillips were to file a separate lawsuit, we assume\nthat her allegation would be that the decree, while it has achieved\nsome desegregation, has left parts of the system unconstitutionally\nsegregated. She would, therefore, not be alleging that the decree,\nitself, has ordered some unlawful conduct, but that problems not\naddressed by the decree must be remedied. Similarly, her suit\nwould not be barred by the doctrine that a consent decree may not\nbe attacked in a collateral proceeding. See Thaggard v. City of\nJackson, 687 F.2d 66 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, sub nom. Ashley\nv. City of Jackson, No. 82-1390 (Oct. 11, 1983). This Court's\ndecision in Thaggard, supra, illustrates our point. The white\nplaintiffs in Thaggard alleged that the consent decrees in that\ncase, which established hiring and promotion goals for blacks,\nresulted in reverse discrimination against them. Thus, their\nallegation was that the decrees, themselves, mandated illegal\nconduct. Their suits were dismissed as impermissible collateral\nattacks on the decrees. Phillips, by contrast, would be permitted\nto allege not that the consent decree, itself, produced segregation\nof the system, but that parts of the system require further desegre-\ngation.\n\n- 25 -\nFinally, the unusual circumstances of this case militate\nstrongly against granting intervention. The unusually long delay\nof Ms. Phillips in filing her motion to intervene and the numerous\nopportunities for her to participate over the course of this 18\nyear old lawsuit weigh strongly against allowing her to intervene.\nMoreover, this is a school desegregation case, where \"voluntary\nresolution is preferable to full litigation because the spirit of\ncooperation inherent in good faith settlement is essential to the\ntrue long-range success of any desegregation remedy.\" Armstrong\nv. Board of School Directors, 616 F.2d 305, 318 (7th Cir. 1980).\nAllowing intervention after a consent decree has been negotiated\nand entered would greatly disrupt and deter the voluntary settlement\nprocess that plays a uniquely significant role in school desegrega-\ntion litigation. The district court correctly denied Phillips'\n11/\nmotion as untimely.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED MS. PHILLIPS' MOTION TO\nINTERVENE BECAUSE HER INTEREST\nWAS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED BY\nTHE UNITED STATES\nThe limitation on intervention in Rule 24(a)(2) that excludes\nindividuals whose interests are already adequately represented is\ndesigned \"to prevent litigation from becoming hopelessly complex.\"\nUnited States v. South Bend Community School Corporation, supra,\n11/ Phillips' untimeliness also prevents her permissive intervention.\nUnited States v. Marion County School District, supra, at 148.\n\n- 26 -\n710 F.2d at 396. The Rule is designed to ensure that everyone whose\ninterest may be adversely affected by litigation has a represen-\ntative in the action. Rule 24(a)(2), therefore, is expressly\ndesigned not to allow every person with an interest to intervene.\nThe first step in determining whether an individual's interest\nis adequately represented is to define the interests of both the\nwould-be intervenor and the purported representative. This Court\nhas repeatedly stated that the only interest justifying intervention\nin a school desegregation case is that of furthering the goal of\ndismantling a dual school system in accordance with the law. Pate\nv. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501, 503 (1979); United\nStates v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277 (1978).\nIn addition, this court has consistently construed the interest\nrequirement of Rule 24(a)(2) narrowly, emphasizing in Diaz v.\nSouthern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d 1118, 1124 (5th Cir.) cert.\ndenied, 400 U.S. 878 (1970) that\nintervention still requires a\n\"direct, substantial, legally\nprotectable interest in the\nproceedings.\"\nSee also, United States v. Perry County Board of Education, supra,\n567 F.2d at 279.\nAs a result of this narrow construction of the term\n\"interest,\" groups that simply disagree with a tactical decision of\na party to the litigation or a policy decision made by a public body\nrepresenting the interest of a would-be intervenor have been denied\n\n- 27 -\nintervention of right and have, at most, been afforded permissive\nintervention. Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762,\n763 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Perry County Board of Education,\nsupra, 567 F.2d at 279; Pate v. Dade County School Board, supra,\n588 F.2d at 503.\nAlthough the United States does not contend that Phillips has\nfailed to satisfy the interest requirement, this Court's limited\nview narrows the purposes for which she may intervene and helps to\ndefine the role of the United States as her representative for\npurposes of Rule 24(a)(2). Her sole interest can be in eliminating\nthe dual school system. This interest is identical to that of the\nUnited States, which intervened in this suit pursuant to Title IX\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2. This statute\nempowers the United States to intervene in actions alleging violations\nof the equal protection clause.\nBecause the interests of the United States and Phillips are\nidentical, the inquiry must focus on the adequacy of the United\nStates' representation of the joint interest in achieving a unitary\nschool system. To demonstrate inadequate representation, Phillips\nmust show that the United States colluded with an opposing party,\nhad an interest adverse to hers, or failed to act competently in\nthe fulfillment of its duty of representation. Martin v. Kalvar\nCorp., 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th Cir. 1969).\nIn establishing that the United States' representation has\nbeen inadequate, Phillips must overcome the presumption of adequate\n\n- 28 -\nrepresentation that arises when an applicant for intervention \"has\nthe same ultimate objective as a party to the existing suit.\"\nUnited States Postal Service v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191 (2d Cir.\n1978). Moreover, it requires a very strong showing to demonstrate\nthat representation of the public interest by the United States in\na school desegregation case is inadequate. See United States v.\nBoard of School Commissioners of Indianapolis, 466 F.2d 573 (7th\nCir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 909 (1973); United States v.\nBoard of Education of the City of Chicago, 88 F.R.D. 679, 686\n(N.D. Ill. 1981).\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to Phillips' allega-\ntion that the United States failed adequately to represent her\ninterest. We do not understand Phillips to contend that the United\nStates colluded with the School Board or represented an interest\n12/\nthat was actually adverse to hers(cid:9) Any suggestion of collusion\nbetween the United States and the Board would be frivolous on its\nface in view of the history of arduous negotiations over the period\nof nearly a year that produced the consent decree. Thus, Phillips'\ncontentions boil down to an assertion that the United States failed\nto advocate adequately the interest in a unitary school system.\n12/ Phillips does suggest (Br. 10-12) that the consent decree was,\nin part, the result of a meeting between the United States Attorney\nfor the Western District of Louisiana, J. Ransdell Keene, and\nofficials of the Civil Rights Division. Certainly, however, it\nwas proper for officials of the Department of Justice to speak with\nthe Department's representative in western Louisiana. Both before\nand after this meeting, the negotiations for the United States were\nconducted exclusively by attorneys from the Civil Rights Division.\n(Continued)\n\n- 29 -\nIn determining whether the United States adequately repre-\nsented the interest in dismantling the dual school system, this\nCourt should remain mindful that it is reviewing a consent decree.\nAs stated in Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977):\n[C]ompromise is the essence of\na settlement. The trial court\nshould not make a proponent of\na proposed settlement \"justify\neach term of a settlement\nagainst a hypothetical or\nspeculative measure of what\nconcessions might have been\ngained; inherent in compromise\nis a yielding of absolutes and\nan abandoning of highest hopes.\"\nBecause of the \"overriding public interest in * * * [the] settlement\"\nof litigation, id. at 1331, courts must be reluctant to upset the\ndelicate balance that a settlement represents and should limit\ntheir inquiry into a consent decree negotiated by the United States\nto whether the district court abused its discretion in determining\nthat the settlement is lawful, reasonable, constitutional and in\naccord with public policy. United States v. City of Miami, 664\nF.2d 435, 439-442 (5th Cir. 1981) (en banc); United States v. City\nof Alexandria, 614 F.2d 1358, 1361 (5th Cir. 1980); Armstrong v.\n12/ (Continued)\nMoreover, any suggestion that the Department collapsed under pressure\nfrom the United States Attorney is belied by the timing of events.\nThe meeting between Mr. Keene and members of the Civil Rights\nDivision occurred on March 16, 1981, but agreement was not reached\nbetween the United States and the School Board until nearly two\nmonths later, after intensive and continuous negotiation.\n\n- 30 -\nBoard of School Directors of the City of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305\n(7th Cir. 1980).\nIndeed, one of the most significant characteristics of a\nconsent decree is that\n[i]t is not the result of\na judicial determination\nafter the annealment of the\nadversary process and a judge's\nreflection about the ultimate\nmerits of conflicting claims.\nIt does not determine right and\nwrong in the initial dispute.\nUnited States v. City of Miami, supra, 664 F.2d at 440. In\napproving a consent decree, a court does not \"reach any ultimate\nconclusions on the issues of fact and law which underlie the merits\nof the dispute,\" Cotton v. Hinton, supra, 559 F.2d at 1330, since\na settlement is\na process of compromise in\nwhich, \"in exchange for the\nsaving of cost and elimination\nof risk, the parties each give\nup something they might have won\nhad they proceeded with the\nlitigation,\" United States v.\nArmour & Co., 402 U.S. 673,\n682 * * * rather than an attempt\nto precisely delineate legal rights.\"\nUnited States v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d 1147, 1152 (5th Cir.\n1975). See also, United States v. Texas Education Agency (Port\nArthur Independent School District), 679 F.2d 1104 (5th Cir.\n1982). A consent decree, therefore, may reflect each party's\nuncertainty regarding its liability or entitlement to relief.\n\n- 31 -\nThe preamble to the consent decree reflects the calculations\nof both parties. The United States had contended in its 1978\nmotion to amend the judgment of unitariness that even though it\nhad not objected to the 1973 decree, it had reserved its right to\nseek further desegregation. The Board countered that the 1973\nconsent decree embodied a final, binding plan. It argued further\nthat if the United States withdrew from the agreement, the Board\nwould be relieved of all obligations under the plan (R. 2549).\nThus, the United States could not be certain that trial of\nits motion to amend the judgment of unitariness would produce any\nfurther desegregation of the system. The further desegregation of\nthe system accomplished by the 1981 consent decree however, is\nsubstantial and good faith implementation of the measures required\nunder the 1981 decree will achieve a unitary school system. As\ndiscussed (supra, p. 6), it has already reduced the number of\none-race schools from 34 to 15 and has reduced the number of\nchildren in one-race schools from nearly 20,000 to approximately\n11,000. Moreover, further desegregation is expected as the newly\nconstructed Huntington School opens and the voluntary transfer and\n13/\nmagnet programs achieve full impact.\n13/ We note numerous omissions and distortions in Phillips'\ndiscussion of the impact of the consent decree. First, she does\nnot acknowledge that the decree's effect is not complete, as\ndescribed above. In addition, she inflates the number of children\nin one-race schools by adding pre-school children who attend\nneighborhood early childhood centers. These centers, ironically,\nanswer in part, Ms. Phillips' original objection to the consent\ndecree. Further, she distorts the facts regarding the magnet\n(Continued)\n\n- 32 -\nIn view of the amount of desegregation achieved by the\ndecree, Phillips' contention that the United States was not\nconcerned about providing a desegregated education for children\nin Caddo Parish is plainly false. The consent decree negotiated\nby the United States is clearly a sufficient desegregation remedy\nthat reflects not only adequate but vigorous representation of\nPhillips' interest.\nShe argues that the United States abandoned its concern\nregarding one-race schools, yet the United States has eliminated\n19 of 34 one-race schools through negotiation of the decree.\nRegarding the continued existence of some one-race schools, the\ndistrict court correctly found (supra, p. 9) that desegregation\nof these schools was impractical because of the geographic isolation\nof schools in the Cooper Road area and the adverse effect on surround-\ning desegregated schools of efforts to transfer students into or\nout of this area. The court further stressed the special educational\nenhancement programs to be placed in these one-race schools and the\navailability to these students of voluntary transfers to magnet\nschools and the system-wide majority-to-minority transfer provision\n(R. 3029).\n13/ (Continued)\nschools. In the three magnet schools that she discusses (Br. 5-6),\nall black applicants have been accepted. With one exception, the\nremainder of the eight magnet schools are clos e to 50% white and\n50% black. The exception is Herndon, which is in its first year of\noperation, but already has a 33% black and 66% white student popula-\ntion.\n\n- 33 -\nNo further findings by the district court were required by\nTasby V. Estes, 572 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. dismissed\nsub nom. Estes v. Metropolitan Branches, Dallas NAACP, 444 U.S.\n437 (1980), or Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 616 F.2d 805\n(5th Cir. 1980). Tasby required the district court to make findings\nregarding the feasibility of employing the desegregation tools\napproved in Swann v. Charlotte - Mecklenburg Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1 (1971), before adopting a plan that included a large\nnumber of one-race schools. Tasby involved a plan that was adopted\nafter full litigation of factual and legal issues. The United States\nand the Board chose in the present case to by-pass the portion of\nthe litigation that this Court found inadequate in Tasby. To require\nthe parties to litigate issues in accordance with Tasby would dis-\nregard the parties right to compromise their lawsuit and disserve\nthe public interest in settling litigation. See Armstrong v. Board\nof School Directors of the City of Milwaukee, supra, 616 F.2d at\n321. Thus, a consent decree may only be disapproved if it authorizes\na practice that is clearly illegal or unconstitutional as a general\nrule. Id. at 321-322. Because Tasby mandates a case-by-case\napproach to one-race schools, rather than a blanket prohibition\nagainst them, the district court properly did not reject the consent\ndecree on the basis of Tasby, nor could it conclude, based on Tasby,\nthat the United States failed to represent adequately the interest\n\n- 34 -\n14/\nin a desegregated school system.(cid:9) For identical reasons, Phillips'\nreliance on Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education, 687\nF.2d 814 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 51 U.S.L.W. 3553 (U.S. Jan.\n25, 1983), is also misplaced.\nPhillips' contention (Br. 8) that Lee v. Macon County Board\nof Education, supra, mandates a holding that the United States'\nrepresentation was inadequate is also incorrect. In Lee, this Court\nheld that the district court's findings were insufficient to justify\na plan under which two-thirds of the elementary grade black students\nin the system would remain in schools over 95 percent black. A far\nsmaller percentage of black students remain in one-race schools\nunder this decree. In addition, Lee did not involve a consent\ndecree. Moreover, this Court reaffirmed, id. at 809:\nClearly, the existence of a\nfew one-race schools does\nnot in itself offend the\nconstitution.\nIndeed, this Court has found that a number of school systems\nare unitary after full implemtation of a desegregation remedy\ndespite the presence of numerous one-race schools. See e.a., Ross\nv. Houston Independent School District, 699 F.2d 218 (5th Cir. 1983);\nCalhoun v. Cook, 522 F.2d 717 (5th Cir.); reh'g denied. 525 F.2d 1203\n14/ Indeed, acceptance of an argument that a consent decree could\nnot permit one-race schools without Tasby findings would amount to\na rule that a school desegregation consent decree could never permit\none-race schools.\n\n- 35 -\n(1975) (per curiam); Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\n537 F.2d 800 (5th Cir. 1976).\nIt is therefore clear that the consent decree's desegregation\nplan was constitutionally acceptable and, a fortiori, the United\nStates' representation of Phillips' interest in desegregating the\nparish schools was adequate.\nIn sum, Phillips has failed to carry her burden of alleging\nfacts that could, if true, amount to the required \"very compelling\nshowing that representation of the public interest by the United\nStates is not adequate * * * •\" United States v. Board of Education,\nsupra, 88 F.R.D. at 686. The district court, therefore, properly\n15/\ndenied, without a hearing, Phillips' motion to intervene.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the appeal should be dismissed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

JONES, et al.,\nPlaintiffs\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Intervenor-Appellee\nJUNE PHILLIPS,\nApplicant for Intervention-Appellant\nV.\nCADDO PARISH SCHOOL BOARD, et al.,\nDefendants-Appellees\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES ON REHEARING EN BANC\nSTATEMENT REGARDING JURISDICTION\nBecause the district court properly denied the motion to\nintervene, this Court does not have jurisdiction and the appeal\nshould be dismissed. Weiser v. White, 505 F.2d 912 (5th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 421 U.S. 993 (1975).\nQUESTION PRESENTED\nWhether the district court properly denied June Phillips'\nmotion to intervene to challenge the consent decree negotiated by\nthe United States and the School Board in this school desegregation\ncase.\nSTATEMENT\nBecause the opening brief and the majority and dissenting\nopinions of the panel recite the history of this litigation in\n\ndetail, this statement will address only those facts essential to\nthe United States' arguments.\nA. Facts\nThis school desegregation action was filed in 1965 by plain-\ntiffs purporting to represent a class of black parents and students\n1/\nin Caddo Parish (R. 1).(cid:9) This Court sanctioned the United States'\nintervention in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\n372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), aff'd 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.) (en\nbanc), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 840 (1967).\nPlans to desegregate the Caddo Parish School system have been\ndisapproved in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nsu ra; Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 417 F.2d 801 (5th\nCir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 904 (1969), and Jones v. Caddo Parish\nSchool Board, 421 F.2d 313 (5th Cir. 1970).\nOn June 1, 1973, a bi-racial committee appointed by the\ndistrict court filed with the court a plan to desegregate the school\nsystem. The private plaintiffs initially filed objections to the\nplan. Shortly thereafter, original counsel for the plaintiffs,\nJesse Stone, moved to strike as counsel lawyers from the NAACP Legal\nDefense Fund because of their objections to the plan and to substi-\ntute Murphy Bell as counsel for the plaintiffs. This motion was\ngranted on July 13, 1973. The United States noted that the plan\nwould leave intact some 34 one-race schools, but concluded: \"The\npresent posture of this law suit considered, the United States\nof America, intervenor herein, interjects no objection to ordering\nimplementation of this plan.\"(cid:9) Upon motion of plaintiffs' new\n1/ \"R.\" references are to the record.\n\n-3-\ncounsel, the district court then struck the objections to the\nplan and on July 20, 1973, ordered implementation of the consent\ndecree. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914\n(5th Cir. 1974).\nApproximately four months later, lawyers from the NAACP\nLegal Defense Fund filed a motion to intervene on behalf of a class\nof black students in Caddo Parish together with a complaint\nchallenging the constitutionality of the desegregation plan.\nAfter the district court held that the motion was untimely and the\nintervenors were already adequately represented, this Court remanded\nthe case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the\nmotion to intervene. Ibid. On remand, no hearing was requested\nor held.\nOn July 20, 1976, the Citizens Advisory Committee, appointed\nto monitor implementation of the plan, reported on several deficien-\ncies in the Board's implementation. The district court appointed a\nspecial master to investigate and report on progress under the plan.\nIn September 1976, the Board filed a motion to have the\nsystem declared unitary and the action dismissed. In October 1977,\nthe United States opposed the motion as premature since the\nspecial master had yet to report and noted several deficiencies in\nthe implementation of the 1973 decree. Plaintiffs, through counsel\nWilliam Jefferson, also filed a memorandum in opposition to the\nBoard's motion, noting shortcomings in the Board's implementation\nof the 1973 plan. This was the only paper filed by plaintiffs\nbetween 1974 and the present. On December 30, 1977, the district\ncourt declared the system unitary and dismissed the action (R. 2442).\n\n-4-\nThe United States, relying for the first time on the ground\nthat the 1973 decree had allowed too many one-race schools, moved\nto amend the district court's judgment (R. 2443), but none of the\noriginal plaintiffs either appealed or moved to amend the judgment.\nA year and a half later, on June 30, 1980, the district court\nentered a minute order, stating in part (R. 2510):\nIf the original plaintiffs still have a viable\ninterest in this case, their counsel should contact\nthe court, in writing, within thirty (30) days of\nthis order. If the plaintiffs' counsel does not\nrespond, this Court will consider that the plaintiffs\nacquiesce in having their interests represented by the\nUnited States as plaintiff-intervenor.\nThis notice was sent to all past and present counsel of record.\nNo representative came forward (R. 2993).\nDuring this period, the United States and the Board entered\nnegotiations to resolve the issues raised by the United States'\nmotion to amend the judgment of unitariness. At no point during\nthese negotiations did anyone purporting to represent private\nplaintiffs attempt to participate in the negotiations. During\nFebruary, March and April 1981, when the decree was taking shape,\nnumerous public meetings were held (R. 2883, 2827). The negotia-\ntions concluded on May 5, 1981, with the signing by the United\nStates and the Board of a settlement agreement. Two days later,\nin response to the joint motion of the parties, the district\ncourt entered the agreement (R. 2584, 2606). The court ordered\n\n4(cid:9) n\n..•..(cid:9) •. ^..__a ......_w J-J.(cid:9) -. . f4(cid:9) .J.Y.s..(cid:9) .a .w<_.. t.l ..._.(cid:9) a..(cid:9) Y ^. •.._(cid:9) 5. .. .(cid:9) .

The decree was published\nin two local newspapers and was reported by three local television\nstations.\nBy the close of the ten day period, thirteen objections had\nbeen received, including one from Ms. Phillips who argued that the\ndecree failed to provide enrichment programs for black students\n(R. 2656). On May 22,,1981, four days after expiration of the\nperiod for objections, Phillips filed a motion to intervene\nindividually and on behalf of a class of black students (R. 2724).\nIn this motion she raised for the first time her complaint that\nthe decree left too many black students in one-race schools. On\nMay 27 and June 8, she filed supplemental motions to intervene\n(R. 2763, 2812). Also on June 8, the United States and the\nBoard each filed memoranda opposing Phillips' motion to intervene\n(R. 2825, 2891).\nOn June 17, 1981, the district court denied the motions to\nintervene and on July 2, 1981, it overruled all objections to the\nconsent decree and ordered its implementation (R. 3026, 3038).\nOn July 16, Phillips filed a notice of appeal from the order of\nJune 17, denying her motion to intervene and from the order of\nJuly 2, overruling her objections to the consent decree (R. 3078).\nOn May 6, 1983, a divided panel of this Court dismissed\nPhillips' appeal, holding that the district court had not abused\n\n- 6 -\nits discretion in finding her motion to intervene untimely. On\nOctober 11, 1983, this Court ordered rehearing of the case en banc.\n1. The consent decree and motion to intervene\nThe consent decree, signed by the district court on May 7,\n1981, dealt comprehensively with the desegregation of the Caddo\nParish schools. It contemplated reduction of the number of one-\nrace schools in the system from thirty-three to fourteen (R. 2912).\nIn fact, the number of one-race schools has now been reduced to\nfifteen. It promised to reduce the number of whites attending\none-race schools from 5,831 to 945 and the number of black\nstudents in such schools from 14,054 to 8,975 (ibid.). The\nfigures for September 1983, show that 327 whites and approximately\n2/\n11,000 blacks remain in one-race schools.\nThe consent decree ordered the Roard to undertake a variety\nof remedies to promote the interrelated goals of desegregation\nand enhanced quality of education. These remedies include majority-\nto-minority transfers, attendance zone changes and student reassign-\nments, school closings and new construction, and the development\n2/ Part of the discrepancy between the projected and actual\nnumber of blacks in one-race schools is attributable to the\nconversion through demographic changes of Fair Park High School\nfrom a predominantly white to a predominantly black school.\nThis adds 1352 black students to this statistic. In addition,\nthe complete effect of the decree cannot be measured until various\neducational enhancement and voluntary transfer programs have had\nan opportunity to work. Furthermore, there has been a one year\ndelay in construction of the Huntington School, which was slated\nto open in 1983, but is now scheduled to open in 1984.\n\n-7-\nof seven magnet schools and one laboratory school and special\neducational programs. The decree established a timetable for\nimplementation beginning in the autumn of 1981 with the\nestablishment of magnet schools and concluding in 1983-1984\nwith the opening of the new Huntington School. (R. 2576).\nIn her motions to intervene, Phillips contended that the\nconsent decree failed to require special programs at the all-black\nschools that would remain under the decree, allowed the survival\nof too many one-race schools, failed generally to promote desegre-\ngation of the system, placed an undue burden on black students by\nrequiring various attendance zone changes, and limited admissions\nto magnet and laboratory schools. She also contended that notice\nshould have been given before entry of the decree to the class\nthat she sought to represent.\n2. The district court's decisions\nPhillips has appealed from two orders of the district court;\nthe first of June 17, 1981, denying her motion to intervene and the\nsecond of July 2, 1981, overruling her objections to the consent\ndecree.\n\n-8-\nWith regard to Phillips' motion to intervene, the district\ncourt concluded that she had failed to satisfy the timeliness\nrequirement of Rule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., and had failed to\ncarry her burden of demonstrating that the United States had not\nrepresented her interests adequately. On the matter of timeliness,\nthe court recounted that Phillips had not filed a motion to inter-\nvene or otherwise opposed the 1973 consent decree, had not responded\nto the minute entry of June 3, 1980, and had not sought intervention\nduring the highly publicized negotiations conducted by the United\nStates and the Board from February to May 1981. The court concluded\nthat Phillips sought to\nsubstitute her judgment for the considered\nopinion of the * * * School Board, The\nDepartment oaf Justice and this court that\nthe Consent Decree will constitutionally\ndesegregate the Caddo Parish School system.\nShe asks that the court allow her to second\nguess the months of turmoil and negotiations\ncarried on by the parties, after she took no\nsteps to participate in that process. This\nthe court cannot allow.(cid:9) (R. 2936).\nThe district court also concluded that Phillips had failed\nto establish that her interests had not been represented adequately\nby the parties to the settlement (ibid.). Relying on Hines v.\nRapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762 (5th Cir. 1973) and Pate\nv. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,\n444 U.S. 835 (1979), the court concluded that the issues presented\n\n-9-\nby Phillips had all been considered and addressed by the United\nStates and the Board and that, as a result, there remained no issue\nthat Phillips could best represent. The court then addressed\nseparately the issues of special programs, magnet schools, zone\nchanges, one-race schools and the burden that the decree placed on\nblack students and concluded that Phillips' contentions with regard\nto each lacked merit (R. 2937-2941).\nIn the same memorandum, the court rejected Phillips' conten-\ntion that this was a class action requiring notice to the class\nbefore a decree could be entered (R. 2939). The court held that a\nclass was never certified and that the United States had never been\ncertified as a class representative, nor purported to act as such.\nThe court also concluded that the attention and publicity attending\nthe negotiation of the consent decree were sufficient to alert all\ninterested parties to the terms of the decree (ibid.).\nFinally, the court disposed of Phillips' contention that\nshe was entitled to a hearing under Calhoun v. Cook, 487 F.2d 680\n(5th Cir. 1973). The court distinguished Calhoun as a case in\nwhich there was a dispute whether all parties to the suit had agreed\nto the settlement. The court found no doubt that the United States\nand the Board had reached a settlement (ibid.).\nPhillips also appeals from the July 2, 1981 order rejecting\nher objections to the consent decree. In a memorandum opinion\nissued that same date, the district court discussed the thirteen\n\n- 10 -\nobjections to the decree, including those of Phillips. The court\ncharacterized Phillips' objections as focusing on the decree's lack\nof specificity regarding educational enhancement programs and the\nfailure to provide for pre-school educational programs. The court\nfound that the decree made ample provision for educational enhance-\nment programs and that Phillips' concern regarding preschool\nprograms, while legitimate, did not allege any failure to desegre-\ngate the system (R. 3026).\n3. The Hanel decision\nOn May 6, 1983, a divided panel of this Court dismissed\nPhillips' appeal. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 704 F.2d\n206. The majority held that the lawsuit was not a class action\nand could, therefore, be settled by the United States and the\nBoard, as the sole remaining parties. It further held that\nPhillips' motion to intervene was properly denied without a\nhearing as untimely. The panel majority reasoned that Ms.\nPhillips could not remain silent through 16 years of litigation\nbefore seeking intervention some 15 days after entry of a consent\ndecree. The majority noted, id. at 218, that Phillips' motion\nto intervene attacked the 1973 decree, yet she waited 8 years\nto raise this objection. The majority also found significant\nthat Phillips failed to challenge the 1977 declaration that the\nsystem was unitary and she did not seek to intervene while the\nUnited States and the Board conducted well-publicized negotiations,\n\n- 11 -\nincluding meetings with the community, in early 1981. Ibid.\nThe majority concluded that because of her active role in the\neducational affairs of Caddo Parish, Phillips was aware of her\ninterest in this case long before she sought to intervene. The\nmajority concluded that Phillips' great and unexplained delay\nmade her motion to intervene prima facie untimely. Id. at 222.\nIn addition, the majority held that because this is not a class\naction, Phillips is not prevented by principles of res judicata\nfrom bringing a separate lawsuit. Id. at 217.\nJudge Goldberg, in dissent, disagreed with the majority\nthat untimeliness could be determined in this case without a\nhearing. He argued that timeliness under Rule 24(a)(2) must be\nmeasured from the point at which the representation of the inter-\nvenor's interest by existing parties became inadequate.\nJudge Goldberg found that Phillips had alleged facts that,\nif true, showed that she had a greater and therefore distinct\ninterest in a desegregated school system that was not adequately\nrepresented by the United States in negotiating the 1981 consent\ndecree. He concluded that a hearing was necessary to determine\nwhether Phillips could reasonably have known prior to publica-\ntion of the 1981 consent decree that her interest was not adequately\nrepresented.\n\n- 12 -\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in finding\nPhillips' motion to intervene untimely on its face. Phillips'\nmotion to intervene, which was filed over two weeks after the\nUnited States and the School Board presented a proposed consent\ndecree to the district court, alleged that the United States had\nfailed to represent adequately her interest in eliminating one-\nrace schools. Her allegation, however, addressed segregation that\nsurvived the 1973 consent decree between the private plaintiffs\nand the Board, to which the United States did not object. Phillips'\ncontention, therefore, actually amounts to an allegation that the\nUnited States' representation first became inadequate in 1973 when\nit failed to object to the consent decree that left 34 one-race\nschools.\nBecause the United States agrees that timeliness under Rule\n24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., must be measured from the date that the\nalleged inadequacy of representation first arose, United Airlines,\nInc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977), Phillips' motion was properly\nfound untimely on its face. United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d\n314 (5th Cir. 1982). Moreover, even if timeliness is measured\nfrom some later point in the litigation, Phillips' unexplained delay\nremains inexcusable. Although she was aware of the United States'\nand the Board's well-publicized efforts to produce a consent decree,\nshe failed to move for intervention until four days after expiration\nof the period for objecting to the decree.\n\n- 13 -\nApplication of the factors for measuring timeliness\narticulated by this Court in Stallworth v. Monsanto, 558 F.2d 257\n(1977), confirms that the district court correctly denied Phillips'\nmotion. The United States and the Board would suffer substantial\nprejudice as a result of Phillips' delay. By failing to intervene\nin a timely fashion, Phillips permitted the United States and the\nBoard to expend time, resources and effort setting this litigation\nin the belief that they were the only interested parties remaining\nin the litigation. Granting her motion would have required the\nparties to litigate the United States' motion to amend the judgment\nof unitariness.\nPhillips, by contrast, has not suffered measurable prejudice\nby denial of her intervention. Her interest in eliminating one-\nrace schools was served by the 1981 decree, which has already\neliminated 19 one-race schools. In addition, because she was not\na party to the decree she remains free to file a separate lawsuit\nseeking further desegregation.\nThe district court also did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying Phillips' intervention, since her interest was adequately\nrepresented by the United States which shared the same interest in\ndismantling the dual school system. The United States, therefore,\ncould only have failed to represent Phillips' interest if it\ncolluded with the School Board, represented an interest that was\nactually adverse to Phillips, or failed to perform adequately as\n\n- 14 -\na representative. Martin v. Kalvar Corp., 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th\nCir. 1969).\nPhillips' assertions boil down to a contention that the\nUnited States did not advocate adequately her interest in reducing\nthe number of one-race schools. The United States contends, how-\never, that by negotiating the elimination of 19 of the 34 one-race\nschools it fully represented Phillips' interest. The decree appears\neven more adequate in view of the fact that it is a consent decree\nthat properly reflects the parties' calculations regarding the\nrisks of litigation and embodies a compromise. See United States\nv. City of Miami, 664 F.2d 435 (5th Cir.) (en banc); Cotton v.\nHinton, 559 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir. 1977). Because Phillips failed to\nallege any facts that could, if true, make the compelling showing\nnecessary to establish inadequate representation by the United\nStates in a school desegregation case, the district court properly\ndenied her motion without a hearing.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY\nCONCLUDED THAT MS. PHILLIPS'\nMOTION TO INTERVENE WAS UNTIMELY\nMs. Phillips contends that the United States failed adequately\n3/\nto represent her interest in eliminating one-race schools.(cid:9) Her\nassertion comes too late to be heard by this Court. The United\n3/ The United States contends (infra, pp. 25-35) that it has repre-\nsented Phillips' interests adequately throughout this litigation.\n\nA\n15 -\n- \nStates took the position as early as 1973 that it would not object\nin this case to a consent decree that left some 34 one-race schools\nin the system. Under Rule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., timeliness\nmust he measured from the date that the alleged inadequacy \nof\nrepresentation first arose. Phillips' challenge to this alleged\nbreakdown in representation first surfaced, however, some eight\nyears later, and seven years after the failure of other potential\nclass representatives to pursue the hearing this Court directed\nthe district court to hold regarding the adequacy of the 1973\ndecree. In these circumstances, the district court's decision on\ntimeliness was plainly correct.\nRule 24(a)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P., requires that an intervenor\nseeking to intervene as of right has the burden of establishing\nthat (1) the application for intervention is timely; (2) the inter-\nvenor has an interest in the subject matter of the litigation; (3)\nthe applicant's ability to protect that interest may be impaired\nor impeded by the disposition of the action; and (4) the interest\nof the intervenor not be adequately represented by the existing\nparties. A deficient showing on any of these four requirements\nwill defeat intervention under Rule 24(a)(2). NAACP V. New York,\n413 U.S. 345, 369 (1973).\nA. The standard for determining timeliness\nThe timeliness of an application for intervention is an\nissue addressed to the discretion of the district court and \"is to\n\n- 16 -\nbe determined from all the circumstances.\" Id. at 366. Accordingly,\na determination of untimeliness can only be overturned if an abuse\nof discretion is shown. Ibid.\nThis Court's thoroughly analyzed the issue of timeliness\nunder Rule 24 in Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257 (1977).\nThat case, identified four factors to structure the inquiry into\ntimeliness (id. at 264-266):\n[1] The length of time during which\nthe would-be intervenor actually\nknew or reasonably should have\nknown of his interest in the case\nbefore he petitioned for leave to\nintervene.\n[2] The extent of the prejudice that\nthe existing parties to the liti-\ngation may suffer as a result of\nthe would-be intervenor's failure\nto apply for intervention as soon\nas he actually knew or reasonably\nshould have known of his interest\nin the case.\n[3] The extent of the prejudice that the\nwould-be intervenor may suffer if his\npetition for leave to intervene is\ndenied.\n[4] The existence of unusual circumstances\nmilitating either for or against a deter-\nmination that the application is timely.\n\n- 17 -\nThe first of these factors is seminal. It establishes the\nstarting point for application of the remaining factors by fixing\nthe point from which timeliness is to be measured. Stallworth\nrejects heavy reliance on absolute measures of timeliness, such as\nthe length of time the litigation has been pending and whether\njudgment has already been rendered and looks instead to when the\nwould-be intervenor learned or reasonably should have learned of\nhis interest in litigation. Id. at 266. As this Court has\nindicated since Stallworth, such absolute measures are relevant,\nbut they are not decisive. See United States v. Marion County\n4/\nSchool District, 590 F.2d 146, 149 (1979). What must be determined\nis when the applicant could reasonably have been expected to seek\nto intervene and the time that lapsed thereafter before intervention\nwas actually sought.\nIn some instances -- and this is one of them -- that threshold\ndetermination cannot be resolved without reference as well to the\nfourth criterion for intervention under Rule 24(a)(2) -- inadequacy\nof representation by existing parties. For, it cannot be gainsaid\nthat one's \"interest\" in participating directly in another's lawsuit\ncould well mature only after learning that the initial identity\nof interest in the subject matter had disintegrated and a different\nlegal viewpoint was being asserted by the litigating party.\n4/ Other courts of appeals have considered such absolute measures\ndecisive.(cid:9) See e.g., Pennsylvania v. Rizzo, 530 F.2d 501 (3d Cir.),\ncert. denied, 426 U.S. 921 (1976); United States v. South Bend\nCommunity School Corp., 710 F.2d 394, 395 (7th Cir. 1983).\n\n0\n- 18 -\nWhile Stallworth did not explicitly link timeliness to\nadequacy of representation, it noted, id. at 264, that the Supreme\nCourt in United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977),\nhad done so. In McDonald, the Supreme Court affirmed the holding\nof the Seventh Circuit that a member of a putative class, whose\nclass had been denied certification, timely filed a motion to\nintervene for purposes of pursuing an appeal to challenge the\ndenial of class certification. The motion to intervene was filed\n18 days after entry of final judgment. This was shortly after the\nwould-be intervenor learned that the named plaintiffs did not\nintend to appeal the denial of class certification. In affirming\nthe timeliness of the motion, the Court stated, id. at 394:\nIn short, as soon as it became\nclear to the respondent that the\ninterests of the unnamed class\nmembers would no longer be pro-\ntected by the named class repre-\nsentatives, she promptly moved to\nintervene to protect those interests.\n[Footnote omitted]\nAccord: Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306, 1321 (5th Cir.) cert.\ndenied, 449 U.S. 1011 (1980), where this Court, citing United\nAirlines, Inc. v. McDonald, supra, recognized that \"the question\nof timeliness is at least partially linked to the question of\n5/\nadequate representation.\"\n5/ This understanding of the linkage between timeliness and\nadequacy of representation is compelled by the logic of Rule\n24(a)(2). The Rule provides a mechanism for representation of the\ninterests of absentees that will be affected by the litigation.\nOn the other hand, the requirement that a would-be intervenor\ndemonstrate that no party in the litigation is adequately representing\n\n- 19 -\nB. Application of the timeliness standard\n1. Ms. Phillips reasonably should have known of the alleged\ninadequacy of representation since at least 1974.\nApplication of the foregoing principles to the present\ncase, demonstrates that Ms. Phillips' attempted intervention\n6/\nwas out of time. Taking Phillips' allegations at face value,\nrepresentation of the interest that she now seeks to assert --\nreduction of the number of one-race schools -- if it ever became\ninadequate, did so in 1974, at the latest. As described (supra,\npp. 2-3), the representatives of the class that Phillips seeks to\nrepresent signed a consent decree in 1973 that contemplated more\nthan twice the number of schools left one-race by the 1981 decree.\nThis number, Phillips concedes, included nearly all of the schools\nthat she now contends must not be allowed to remain one-race (Br.\n7/\n9-lO)T The United States, upon whom Phillips contends she relied\n5/ (Continued)\nhis interest discourages multiple representation and promotes\njudicial economy and efficiency. A rule that failed to link timeli-\nness to the requirement of inadequate representation would frustrate\nthis purpose and invite unnecessary applications for intervention.\nMoreover, such applications would be denied uniformly, since a\nwould-be intervenor cannot successfully apply for intervention until\nrepresentation becomes inadequate. It would make little sense to\nmeasure timeliness from a point at which a would-be intervenor could\nnot move successfully for intervention.\n6/ The United States contends (infra, pp. 31-32 n. 13) that many\nof Phillips' allegations are erroneous. For purposes of this first\nargument, however, we need not discuss those errors.\n7/ \"Br.\" references are to June Phillips' \"Fourth Supplemental\nBrief.\"\n\n- 20 -\nfor representation, did not object to the 1973 decree. Indeed, a\ngroup of attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund unsuccessfully\nsought intervention to challenge the 1973 decree in the district\ncourt. This Court remanded the case to the district court for a\nhearing on the motion to intervene, Jones v. Caddo Parish School\nBoard, 499 F.2d 914, (1974), but the intervenors never returned to\nthe district court. Ms. Phillips' claim of inadequate representa-\ntion (such as it is) thus ripened at that time and her efforts to\nintervene should have occurred then, or shortly thereafter -- and\nnot some seven years later.\nPhillips has not alleged, nor could she, that she was unaware\nof the 1973 decree or the fact that as of 1974 nobody was seeking\nto challenge the decree. As a parent with children in the school\nsystem during this period and as an educator who served as a member\nof the Caddo Parish School Board during 1975 and 1976, Jones v.\nCaddo Parish School Board, supra, 704 F.2d at 220 n. 22, she surely\nknew of the decree, its operation and the dormancy of any attempts\nto alter it.\nPhillips contends that her interest was represented until\nMay 1981 when the United States and the Board signed a second\nconsent decree, yet, that decree served Phillips' interest more\nfully than the 1973 decree by reducing the number of one-race\nschools from 34 to 15. Indeed, Phillips does not contend that her\ninterest was served less well by the 1981 decree than by the 1973\n\n- 21 -\ndecree. It is simply not possible that her interest was adequately\nrepresented by the 1973 decree but not by the 1981 decree.\nEven if this Court should conclude that Phillips' interest\nwas adequately represented until 1981, it should hold that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in finding her inter-\nvention untimely. In her first supplemental motion to intervene,\nPhillips acknowledged that she had met with government counsel\nregarding the case. She also found it significant that the attorney\nwith whom she had met was replaced on the case in November 1980 and\nthat the new attorney had principal responsibility for representing\nthe United States in the negotiations.\nMoreover, a series of well-publicized public meetings were\nheld from February through April regarding the course of the negotia-\ntions. Thus, the community was aware of the negotiations and that\nthe parties were moving toward a consent decree. Yet, in spite of\nher concern about the change in government counsel, and her awareness\nthat a consent decree was imminent, she did not seek intervention\nin the case until four days after expiration of the period for\nobjecting to the consent decree. Her delay in moving to protect\nher interest allowed the United States and the Board to expend\nconsiderable time, effort and resources in the belief that they\nwere the only parties to the litigation.\nThe effect of this delay was exacerbated by the failure of\nPhillips or any other member of the class that she now seeks to\n\n€(cid:9) !(cid:9) ._.\n- 22 -\nrepresent to respond to the express invitation of the district\ncourt in June 1980 to reenter the case. This failure to come\nforward allowed the United States and the Board to believe that\nthey were the sole persons interested in participating in this\nlitigation.\nPhillips, has failed to offer any plausible explanation for\n8/(cid:9) 9/\nher delay between 1974(cid:9) and 1981.(cid:9) Because the burden of establish-\ning timeliness was hers, this failure is fatal to her motion to\nintervene. Indeed, a similar unexplained lapse proved fatal to\nwould-be intervenors in United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314\n(5th Cir. 1982). This Court held that a four year delay was untimely\non its face and a hearing was not necessary. Similarly, Phillips\nmotion is untimely on its face and fails to raise any issue of\nfact necessitating a hearing. See also, United States v. Perry\nCounty Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277, 280 (5th Cir. 1978).\n2. Prejudice to the parties\nAlthough Phillips' motion is untimely on its face, examination\nof the remaining Stallworth factors enforces the correctness of the\n8/ We will assume for argument sake that her interest was ade-\nquately represented until 1974 when the would-be intervenors failed\nto pursue a hearing in the district court.\n9/ From 1974 to 1978, nobody sought to challenge the 1973 decree\non the basis that it contemplated allowing 34 one-race schools. The\nCitizens' Advisory Committee letter of July 20, 1976 and the responses\nof the United States and William Jefferson to the Board's 1976 motion\nto dismiss all complained that the 1973 decree had been implemented\ninadquately and not that the decree, itself, was inadequate.\n\n- 23 -\ndistrict court's denial of her intervention. The prejudice that\nPhillips' delay from 1974 to 1981 caused the United States and the\nBoard is extensive. By failing to step forward until after final\njudgment, Phillips has allowed the United States and the Board to\nexpend considerable time, resources and effort settling this litiga-\ntion in the belief that they adequately represented all interests\nramaining in the litigation. Granting Phillips intervention would\nhave erased all of this effort and required the parties to litigate\nthe United States' 1978 motion to amend the declaration of unitari-\nness. Although the United States is confident that its motion was\nwelltaken and would have been granted, the outcome of any litigation\nis uncertain (infra p. 31). Thus, at best, granting intervention\nwould have delayed adoption of a final desegregation plan and\npostponed a desegregated education for thousands of children in\nthe Caddo Parish School system.\n3. Prejudice to Ms. Phillips\nThe prejudice to Phillips resulting from denial of her motion\nto intervene is amorphous at best. Phillips' sole remaining contention\nregarding the inadequacy of the consent decree is that it allows\ntoo many one-race schools (Br. 7-8). She cannot and does not\ncontest, however, that far more one-race schools were operated\nunder the 1973 consent decree, which she did not challenge. There-\nfore, her interest in the elimination of one-race schools is served,\nrather than prejudiced, by the 1981 decree.\n\n- 24 -\nMoreover, she remains free, after denial of her motion to\nintervene, to pursue a separate lawsuit alleging that the school\n10/\nsystem is unconstitutionally segregated.(cid:9) The survival of alterna-\ntive avenues of redress is a principal factor mitigating prejudice\ncaused by denial of a motion to intervene. United States v. Louisiana,\n90 F.R.D. 358 359 (E.D. La. 1981) (three-judge court).\n10/ We adhere to, although we do not repeat, the argument in our\nopening brief, adopted by the panel, that this was not a class\naction. As a consequence, the judgment is not res judicata with\nregard to anyone but the two parties -- the United States and the\nSchool Board. See General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318\n(1980). This Court has frequently suggested that the proper way\nfor parental groups to complain about a desegregation decree is to\nintervene in the ongoing action and not to file a separate lawsuit.\nE.g., Hines v. Rapides Parish, supra; Pate v. Dade County, supra.\nThis rule, however, has been announced in situations in which\nparental groups sought to challenge the operation of the decree\nitself and, generally, to oppose steps toward desegregation. See,\ne.g., Pate v. Dade County, supra; United States v. Perry County,\nsupra. If Phillips were to file a separate lawsuit, we assume\nthat her allegation would be that the decree, while it has achieved\nsome desegregation, has left parts of the system unconstitutionally\nsegregated. She would, therefore, not be alleging that the decree,\nitself, has ordered some unlawful conduct, but that problems not\naddressed by the decree must be remedied. Similarly, her suit\nwould not be barred by the doctrine that a consent decree may not\nbe attacked in a collateral proceeding. See Thaggard v. City of\nJackson, 687 F.2d 66 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, sub nom. Ashley\nv. City of Jackson, No. 82-1390 (Oct. 11, 1983). This Court's\ndecision in Thaggard, supra, illustrates our point. The white\nplaintiffs in Thaggard alleged that the consent decrees in that\ncase, which established hiring and promotion goals for blacks,\nresulted in reverse discrimination against them. Thus, their\nallegation was that the decrees, themselves, mandated illegal\nconduct. Their suits were dismissed as impermissible collateral\nattacks on the decrees. Phillips, by contrast, would be permitted\nto allege not that the consent decree, itself, produced segregation\nof the system, but that parts of the system require further desegre-\ngation.\n\n- 25 -\nFinally, the unusual circumstances of this case militate\nstrongly against granting intervention. The unusually long delay\nof Ms. Phillips in filing her motion to intervene and the numerous\nopportunities for her to participate over the course of this 18\nyear old lawsuit weigh strongly against allowing her to intervene.\nMoreover, this is a school desegregation case, where \"voluntary\nresolution is preferable to full litigation because the spirit of\ncooperation inherent in good faith settlement is essential to the\ntrue long-range success of any desegregation remedy.\" Armstrong\nv. Board of School Directors, 616 F.2d 305, 318 (7th Cir. 1980).\nAllowing intervention after a consent decree has been negotiated\nand entered would greatly disrupt and deter the voluntary settlement\nprocess that plays a uniquely significant role in school desegrega-\ntion litigation. The district court correctly denied Phillips'\n11/\nmotion as untimely.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED MS. PHILLIPS' MOTION TO\nINTERVENE BECAUSE HER INTEREST\nWAS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED BY\nTHE UNITED STATES\nThe limitation on intervention in Rule 24(a)(2) that excludes\nindividuals whose interests are already adequately represented is\ndesigned \"to prevent litigation from becoming hopelessly complex.\"\nUnited States v. South Bend Community School Corporation, supra,\n11/ Phillips' untimeliness also prevents her permissive intervention.\nUnited States v. Marion County School District, supra, at 148.\n\n- 26 -\n710 F.2d at 396. The Rule is designed to ensure that everyone whose\ninterest may be adversely affected by litigation has a represen-\ntative in the action. Rule 24(a)(2), therefore, is expressly\ndesigned not to allow every person with an interest to intervene.\nThe first step in determining whether an individual's interest\nis adequately represented is to define the interests of both the\nwould-be intervenor and the purported representative. This Court\nhas repeatedly stated that the only interest justifying intervention\nin a school desegregation case is that of furthering the goal of\ndismantling a dual school system in accordance with the law. Pate\nv. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501, 503 (1979); United\nStates v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277 (1978).\nIn addition, this court has consistently construed the interest\nrequirement of Rule 24(a)(2) narrowly, emphasizing in Diaz v.\nSouthern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d 1118, 1124 (5th Cir.) cert.\ndenied, 400 U.S. 878 (1970) that\nintervention still requires a\n\"direct, substantial, legally\nprotectable interest in the\nproceedings.\"\nSee also, United States v. Perry County Board of Education, supra,\n567 F.2d at 279.\nAs a result of this narrow construction of the term\n\"interest,\" groups that simply disagree with a tactical decision of\na party to the litigation or a policy decision made by a public body\nrepresenting the interest of a would-be intervenor have been denied\n\n- 27 -\nintervention of right and have, at most, been afforded permissive\nintervention. Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762,\n763 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Perry County Board of Education,\nsupra, 567 F.2d at 279; Pate v. Dade County School Board, supra,\n588 F.2d at 503.\nAlthough the United States does not contend that Phillips has\nfailed to satisfy the interest requirement, this Court's limited\nview narrows the purposes for which she may intervene and helps to\ndefine the role of the United States as her representative for\npurposes of Rule 24(a)(2). Her sole interest can be in eliminating\nthe dual school system. This interest is identical to that of the\nUnited States, which intervened in this suit pursuant to Title IX\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2. This statute\nempowers the United States to intervene in actions alleging violations\nof the equal protection clause.\nBecause the interests of the United States and Phillips are\nidentical, the inquiry must focus on the adequacy of the United\nStates' representation of the joint interest in achieving a unitary\nschool system. To demonstrate inadequate representation, Phillips\nmust show that the United States colluded with an opposing party,\nhad an interest adverse to hers, or failed to act competently in\nthe fulfillment of its duty of representation. Martin v. Kalvar\nCorp., 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th Cir. 1969).\nIn establishing that the United States' representation has\nbeen inadequate, Phillips must overcome the presumption of adequate\n\n- 28 -\nrepresentation that arises when an applicant for intervention \"has\nthe same ultimate objective as a party to the existing suit.\"\nUnited States Postal Service v. Brennan, 579 F.2d 188, 191 (2d Cir.\n1978). Moreover, it requires a very strong showing to demonstrate\nthat representation of the public interest by the United States in\na school desegregation case is inadequate. See United States v.\nBoard of School Commissioners of Indianapolis, 466 F.2d 573 (7th\nCir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 909 (1973); United States v.\nBoard of Education of the City of Chicago, 88 F.R.D. 679, 686\n(N.D. Ill. 1981).\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to Phillips' allega-\ntion that the United States failed adequately to represent her\ninterest. We do not understand Phillips to contend that the United\nStates colluded with the School Board or represented an interest\n12/\nthat was actually adverse to hers(cid:9) Any suggestion of collusion\nbetween the United States and the Board would be frivolous on its\nface in view of the history of arduous negotiations over the period\nof nearly a year that produced the consent decree. Thus, Phillips'\ncontentions boil down to an assertion that the United States failed\nto advocate adequately the interest in a unitary school system.\n12/ Phillips does suggest (Br. 10-12) that the consent decree was,\nin part, the result of a meeting between the United States Attorney\nfor the Western District of Louisiana, J. Ransdell Keene, and\nofficials of the Civil Rights Division. Certainly, however, it\nwas proper for officials of the Department of Justice to speak with\nthe Department's representative in western Louisiana. Both before\nand after this meeting, the negotiations for the United States were\nconducted exclusively by attorneys from the Civil Rights Division.\n(Continued)\n\n- 29 -\nIn determining whether the United States adequately repre-\nsented the interest in dismantling the dual school system, this\nCourt should remain mindful that it is reviewing a consent decree.\nAs stated in Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977):\n[C]ompromise is the essence of\na settlement. The trial court\nshould not make a proponent of\na proposed settlement \"justify\neach term of a settlement\nagainst a hypothetical or\nspeculative measure of what\nconcessions might have been\ngained; inherent in compromise\nis a yielding of absolutes and\nan abandoning of highest hopes.\"\nBecause of the \"overriding public interest in * * * [the] settlement\"\nof litigation, id. at 1331, courts must be reluctant to upset the\ndelicate balance that a settlement represents and should limit\ntheir inquiry into a consent decree negotiated by the United States\nto whether the district court abused its discretion in determining\nthat the settlement is lawful, reasonable, constitutional and in\naccord with public policy. United States v. City of Miami, 664\nF.2d 435, 439-442 (5th Cir. 1981) (en banc); United States v. City\nof Alexandria, 614 F.2d 1358, 1361 (5th Cir. 1980); Armstrong v.\n12/ (Continued)\nMoreover, any suggestion that the Department collapsed under pressure\nfrom the United States Attorney is belied by the timing of events.\nThe meeting between Mr. Keene and members of the Civil Rights\nDivision occurred on March 16, 1981, but agreement was not reached\nbetween the United States and the School Board until nearly two\nmonths later, after intensive and continuous negotiation.\n\n- 30 -\nBoard of School Directors of the City of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305\n(7th Cir. 1980).\nIndeed, one of the most significant characteristics of a\nconsent decree is that\n[i]t is not the result of\na judicial determination\nafter the annealment of the\nadversary process and a judge's\nreflection about the ultimate\nmerits of conflicting claims.\nIt does not determine right and\nwrong in the initial dispute.\nUnited States v. City of Miami, supra, 664 F.2d at 440. In\napproving a consent decree, a court does not \"reach any ultimate\nconclusions on the issues of fact and law which underlie the merits\nof the dispute,\" Cotton v. Hinton, supra, 559 F.2d at 1330, since\na settlement is\na process of compromise in\nwhich, \"in exchange for the\nsaving of cost and elimination\nof risk, the parties each give\nup something they might have won\nhad they proceeded with the\nlitigation,\" United States v.\nArmour & Co., 402 U.S. 673,\n682 * * * rather than an attempt\nto precisely delineate legal rights.\"\nUnited States v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d 1147, 1152 (5th Cir.\n1975). See also, United States v. Texas Education Agency (Port\nArthur Independent School District), 679 F.2d 1104 (5th Cir.\n1982). A consent decree, therefore, may reflect each party's\nuncertainty regarding its liability or entitlement to relief.\n\n- 31 -\nThe preamble to the consent decree reflects the calculations\nof both parties. The United States had contended in its 1978\nmotion to amend the judgment of unitariness that even though it\nhad not objected to the 1973 decree, it had reserved its right to\nseek further desegregation. The Board countered that the 1973\nconsent decree embodied a final, binding plan. It argued further\nthat if the United States withdrew from the agreement, the Board\nwould be relieved of all obligations under the plan (R. 2549).\nThus, the United States could not be certain that trial of\nits motion to amend the judgment of unitariness would produce any\nfurther desegregation of the system. The further desegregation of\nthe system accomplished by the 1981 consent decree however, is\nsubstantial and good faith implementation of the measures required\nunder the 1981 decree will achieve a unitary school system. As\ndiscussed (supra, p. 6), it has already reduced the number of\none-race schools from 34 to 15 and has reduced the number of\nchildren in one-race schools from nearly 20,000 to approximately\n11,000. Moreover, further desegregation is expected as the newly\nconstructed Huntington School opens and the voluntary transfer and\n13/\nmagnet programs achieve full impact.\n13/ We note numerous omissions and distortions in Phillips'\ndiscussion of the impact of the consent decree. First, she does\nnot acknowledge that the decree's effect is not complete, as\ndescribed above. In addition, she inflates the number of children\nin one-race schools by adding pre-school children who attend\nneighborhood early childhood centers. These centers, ironically,\nanswer in part, Ms. Phillips' original objection to the consent\ndecree. Further, she distorts the facts regarding the magnet\n(Continued)\n\n- 32 -\nIn view of the amount of desegregation achieved by the\ndecree, Phillips' contention that the United States was not\nconcerned about providing a desegregated education for children\nin Caddo Parish is plainly false. The consent decree negotiated\nby the United States is clearly a sufficient desegregation remedy\nthat reflects not only adequate but vigorous representation of\nPhillips' interest.\nShe argues that the United States abandoned its concern\nregarding one-race schools, yet the United States has eliminated\n19 of 34 one-race schools through negotiation of the decree.\nRegarding the continued existence of some one-race schools, the\ndistrict court correctly found (supra, p. 9) that desegregation\nof these schools was impractical because of the geographic isolation\nof schools in the Cooper Road area and the adverse effect on surround-\ning desegregated schools of efforts to transfer students into or\nout of this area. The court further stressed the special educational\nenhancement programs to be placed in these one-race schools and the\navailability to these students of voluntary transfers to magnet\nschools and the system-wide majority-to-minority transfer provision\n(R. 3029).\n13/ (Continued)\nschools. In the three magnet schools that she discusses (Br. 5-6),\nall black applicants have been accepted. With one exception, the\nremainder of the eight magnet schools are clos e to 50% white and\n50% black. The exception is Herndon, which is in its first year of\noperation, but already has a 33% black and 66% white student popula-\ntion.\n\n- 33 -\nNo further findings by the district court were required by\nTasby V. Estes, 572 F.2d 1010 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. dismissed\nsub nom. Estes v. Metropolitan Branches, Dallas NAACP, 444 U.S.\n437 (1980), or Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 616 F.2d 805\n(5th Cir. 1980). Tasby required the district court to make findings\nregarding the feasibility of employing the desegregation tools\napproved in Swann v. Charlotte - Mecklenburg Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1 (1971), before adopting a plan that included a large\nnumber of one-race schools. Tasby involved a plan that was adopted\nafter full litigation of factual and legal issues. The United States\nand the Board chose in the present case to by-pass the portion of\nthe litigation that this Court found inadequate in Tasby. To require\nthe parties to litigate issues in accordance with Tasby would dis-\nregard the parties right to compromise their lawsuit and disserve\nthe public interest in settling litigation. See Armstrong v. Board\nof School Directors of the City of Milwaukee, supra, 616 F.2d at\n321. Thus, a consent decree may only be disapproved if it authorizes\na practice that is clearly illegal or unconstitutional as a general\nrule. Id. at 321-322. Because Tasby mandates a case-by-case\napproach to one-race schools, rather than a blanket prohibition\nagainst them, the district court properly did not reject the consent\ndecree on the basis of Tasby, nor could it conclude, based on Tasby,\nthat the United States failed to represent adequately the interest\n\n- 34 -\n14/\nin a desegregated school system.(cid:9) For identical reasons, Phillips'\nreliance on Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education, 687\nF.2d 814 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 51 U.S.L.W. 3553 (U.S. Jan.\n25, 1983), is also misplaced.\nPhillips' contention (Br. 8) that Lee v. Macon County Board\nof Education, supra, mandates a holding that the United States'\nrepresentation was inadequate is also incorrect. In Lee, this Court\nheld that the district court's findings were insufficient to justify\na plan under which two-thirds of the elementary grade black students\nin the system would remain in schools over 95 percent black. A far\nsmaller percentage of black students remain in one-race schools\nunder this decree. In addition, Lee did not involve a consent\ndecree. Moreover, this Court reaffirmed, id. at 809:\nClearly, the existence of a\nfew one-race schools does\nnot in itself offend the\nconstitution.\nIndeed, this Court has found that a number of school systems\nare unitary after full implemtation of a desegregation remedy\ndespite the presence of numerous one-race schools. See e.a., Ross\nv. Houston Independent School District, 699 F.2d 218 (5th Cir. 1983);\nCalhoun v. Cook, 522 F.2d 717 (5th Cir.); reh'g denied. 525 F.2d 1203\n14/ Indeed, acceptance of an argument that a consent decree could\nnot permit one-race schools without Tasby findings would amount to\na rule that a school desegregation consent decree could never permit\none-race schools.\n\n- 35 -\n(1975) (per curiam); Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\n537 F.2d 800 (5th Cir. 1976).\nIt is therefore clear that the consent decree's desegregation\nplan was constitutionally acceptable and, a fortiori, the United\nStates' representation of Phillips' interest in desegregating the\nparish schools was adequate.\nIn sum, Phillips has failed to carry her burden of alleging\nfacts that could, if true, amount to the required \"very compelling\nshowing that representation of the public interest by the United\nStates is not adequate * * * •\" United States v. Board of Education,\nsupra, 88 F.R.D. at 686. The district court, therefore, properly\n15/\ndenied, without a hearing, Phillips' motion to intervene.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the appeal should be dismissed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

Cleveland v. Union Parish Sch. Bd., 406 F.2d 1331 (5th Cir. 1969). \n \nThe dissenting opinion to that order appears in 406 F.2d at 1333. \nBoth the Western District and the Eastern District cases were among those consolidated on appeal in Adams v. Mathews, 403 F.2d \n181 (5th Cir. 1968). \n \n5  303 F.Supp. 1224 (E.D.La.1969). \n \n \n6  298 F.Supp. 283 (E.D.La.1969). \n \n \n7  ‘Here the district court found that the school board acted in good faith. But good faith does not excuse a board’s non-compliance \nwith its affirmative duty to liquidate the dual system. Good faith is relevant only as a necessary ingredient of an acceptable \n \ndesegregation plan.’ Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal Separate Sch. Dist., supra 409 F.2d at 684. \n \n8  Twenty-two of the school boards were ordered to integrate their school systems beginning with the 1965-66 school year. Two \nboards commenced with the 1964-65 school year. Nine began in 1966-67, and five did not begin until the 1967-68 school year. \n \n \n9  ‘With every ounce of sincerity which we possess we think freedom of choice is the best plan available. We are not today going to \njeopardize the success already achieved by casting aside something that is working and reach blindly into an experimental ‘grab \n \nbag.“ \n293 F.Supp. at 88. \n \n10  See the concurring opinion of Judge Rubin in Duval County: \n‘Green emphasizes that school officials have a continuing duty to take whatever action may be necessary to provide ‘prompt and \n \neffective disestablishment of a dual system.’ If one method is ineffective, they are to try another. Hence, no single plan is or can be \njudicially approved as a catholicon. ‘Brown I and all of its successors, as well as Green, Monroe, and Raney, contemplate that \nschool plans will be prepared by local officials and school boards, not by courts. But if local officials fail to assume their \nresponsibilities under the Constitution, district courts must continue to attempt to formulate the plans that should be prepared by \nschool officials based on their expert knowledge, training and skill.’ (Citations omitted.) \n402 F.2d at 908. \n \n11  See, e.g., the discussion of Whittenberg v. Greenville County School District, 298 F.Supp. 784 (D.C.S.C., March 31, 1969), at note \n14, infra, and accompanying text. \n \n \n12  But a plan which contributes toward preserving segregated schools by incorporating zones corresponding to racially separate \nresidential patterns is unacceptable. United States v. Indianola, supra. \n \n \n13  At least two district judges in Louisiana have ordered the use of the facilities of this center. Tangipahoa Parish, before us on this \nappeal, was ordered on October 15, 1968 to produce a plan for the 1969-70 school year for unitary operation of its school system. \n \nWhen the school board informed the court that it was unable to find a plan better than the one in existence, the court appointed the \nCenter to prepare a plan. A hearing has not yet been held on whether the Center’s plan will be adopted. \nIn Harris v. St. John the Baptist Parish Sch. Bd., Civ.No. 13212 (E.D.La. Apr. 23, 1969), the school board, after it did not come up \nwith a plan of its own, was ordered to consult with the Center. A hearing was set on the Center’s plan. The board came in with two \nplans of its own. The district judge accepted one of the board’s plans, which incorporated some of the Center’s suggestions. \n \n  45 \n \n\nHall v. St. Helena Parish School Bd., 417 F.2d 801 (1969)   \n \n \n14  The district court directed that all school districts submit to the Office of Education, HEW, their existing method of operation, \nalong with any changes proposed by them, and to seek to develop in conjunction with HEW an acceptable plan of operation \n \n‘conformable to the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs * * * and consonant in timing and method with the practical and \nadministrative problems faced by the particular districts.’ If a plan is agreed upon by the school district and HEW, the South \nCarolina district court will approve it unless the plaintiffs show it does not meet constitutional standards. If the school district \nalready is operating under a plan approved by HEW, it will be adopted by the court absent a showing of constitutional infirmity. If \nno agreed plan is developed, the court will hold a hearing and enter its decree, considering the respective proposed plans of the \ndistrict, the plaintiffs, and HEW. \n \n15  The Supreme Court said: ‘The general experience under ‘freedom of choice’ to date has been such as to indicate its ineffectiveness \nas a tool of desegregation.’ 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1695, 20 L.Ed.2d at 725. \n \nSee also the opinion of District Judge Heebe in Moses v. Washington Parish School Board, 276 F.Supp. 834 at 851-852 \n(E.D.La.1967): \n‘If this Court must pick a method of assigning students to schools within a particular school district, barring very unusual \ncircumstances, we could imagine no method more inappropriate, more unreasonable, more needlessly wasteful in every respect, \nthan the socalled ‘free-choice’ system. \n‘Under such a system the school board cannot know in advance how many students will choose any school in the system— it \ncannot even begin to estimate the number. The first principle of pupil assignment in the scheme of school administration is thus \nthwarted; the principle ought to be to utilize all available classrooms and schools to accommodate the most favorable number of \nstudents; instead, this aim is surrendered in order to introduce an element of ‘liberty’ (never before part of efficient school \nadministration) on the part of the students in the choice of their own school. Obviously there is no constitutional ‘right’ for any \nstudent to attend the public school of his own choosing. But the extension of the privilege of choosing one’s school, far from being \na ‘right’ of the students, is not even consistent with sound school administration. Rather, the creation of such a choice only has the \nresult of demoralizing the school system itself, and actually depriving every student of a good education. \n‘Under a ‘free-choice’ system, the school board cannot know or estimate the number of students who will want to attend any \nschool, or the identity of those who will eventually get their choice. Consequently, the board cannot make plans for the \ntransportation of students to schools, plan curricula, or even plan such things as lunch allotments and schedules; moreover, since in \nno case except by purest coincidence will an appropriate distribution of students result, and each school will have either more or \nless than the number it is designed to efficiently handle, many students at the end of the free-choice period have to be reassigned to \nschools other than those of their choice— this time on a strict geographical-proximity basis, see the Jefferson County decree, thus \nburdening the board, in the middle of what should be a period of firming up the system and making final adjustments, with the \nawesome task of determining which students will have to be transferred and which schools will receive them. Until that final task \nis completed, neither the board nor any of the students can be sure of which school they will be attending; and many students will \nin the end be denied the very ‘free choice’ the system is supposed to provide them.’ (Emphasis in original.) \n \n16  See Davis v. Mobile County, supra, in which this court required a zone plan for urban areas but left freedom of choice in effect in \nrural areas. See also the dissenting opinion to the denial of en banc hearing in the instant cases, 406 F.2d at 1338-1339: ‘I am not \n \nsuggesting that freedom of choice should necessarily be abandoned in favor of zoning. * * * There is nothing necessarily \nunconstitutional about freedom of choice of geographic zoning or a combination of the two.’ \n \n1  Not available. This signal followed by dashes in adjoining columns means figures for all such columns are available \n \n \n2  The 1969-70 figures for all school systems, where shown, are based upon the incomplete results of the latest choice period (March \n1, 1969 to April 1, 1969). They are not intended to be a completely accurate forecast of the racial make-up of the schools involved \n \nfor 1969-70. At oral argument of these cases the parties were directed to furnish this information to the court to the extent possible, \nand in most instances they have done so. \n \n3  Figures given for faculty cross-overs for 1969-70 in all school systems, where shown, represent only the planned or tentative \nassignments as reported to the court by the school boards since oral argument. \n \n \n4  Fractions have been dropped from teacher cross-over figures, with no attempt to round off the figure. \n \n \n5  In a report filed in the district court February 27, 1967, a copy of which has been filed with this court pursuant to our oral order for \nadditional data, the Bossier Parish School Board states that it has set as a minimum goal for 1969-70 a 100% increase in faculty \n \nintegration. \n \n6  In this parish there are minor discrepancies between those figures collated by the appellants and those by the United States. The \ndifferences are nominal and do not impel a different conclusion on any issue in the case. We use appellants’ figures. \n \n \n  46 \n \n\nHall v. St. Helena Parish School Bd., 417 F.2d 801 (1969)   \n \n \n7  In a report filed in the district court on February 21, 1969 Caddo Parish states it has a goal of increasing faculty cross-over by 50% \nfor the 1969-70 school year. \n \n \n8  In its report to the district court in February, the East Carroll School Board states it has plans to increase faculty integration by \napproximately 100% in 1969-70. \n \n \n6  In this parish there are minor discrepancies between those figures collated by the appellants and those by the United States. The \ndifferences are nominal and do not impel a different conclusion on any issue in the case. We use appellants’ figures. \n \n \n9  1967-68 reports of school board to the district court show that no teacher served full time in a Cross-over situation. 1968-69 reports \ndo not distinguish between full and part-time teachers. \n \n \n10  Vermillion Parish has only one remaining school in which negroes are predominant. That school is all-Negro. \n \n \n11  Statistics on student integration in 1967-68 in Winn Parish appear to be derived from choice form reports to the district court dated \nSeptember 8, 1967. They do not necessarily represent the number of students attending integrated schools during that year. \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  47 \n ",

During \nthat time the System has followed a  tortuous path filled with \nnumerous  order.s,  plans.,  judgments.,  appeals  and modi£ications \nand  alterations of plans,, .all tailored to .meet -evolving legal \nstandards in an  attempt to achieve unitary .status..  The £irst \norders involving extensive re.zoning  andbussing were issued in \n1970. . \nAt the reguest of the United States, in early 1973, \nthe Court appointed a ·bi-racial committee to prepare  a  desegre-\ngation plan for the System.  The  bi-racial committee  filed its \nreport and recommendation on .June  1,,  1973,  after which  all \nparties were  given an opportunity to respond and object to the \nreport..  The  report and recommendations  stated:: \n\"The  Committee herewith submits to the \nCourt its plan £or further  desegregation \nof the schools in the Caddo  Parish School \nDistrict.  The  plan contemplates  full \nresolution of the Plaintiffs'  claims \nin their petition of February 25,  1972  and \nMarch  6,  1972  and upon  approval by the \nCourt wil\"l bring about the conversion \nof the school district to a  unitary \nschool  system.\"  (Emphasis  added.) \n2546 \nl \n\nCase 5:65-cv-11055-EEF   Document 1-2   Filed 09/20/06   Page 4 of 57 PageID #:  48\nThe  original ·plainti££.s £ilea objections,  which were .later \nwithdrawn and  stricken at their request,  on  June  ll, 1973. \nOn  July 2, 1973,  the United States. £i1ed its res-\nponse,  indicating concern about  \"the continued operation \no£  3-4  one-race or predominately one-race schools'\"  ana \ncriticizing the .£ailure o£ the plan to  \"state the £acts \nrelied upon to j usti£y their .continued operation,  provide \noptions to £ully desegregate them,  or state ·the \"feasibility \no£ implementing a·l.l  or parts o£  desegregation plans £or these \nschools  on record in this case. . \"  This Court's July 20.,  1973 \nOrder stated .the position o£ ·the Uni·ted .States at that time': \n\"The present posture o£ this lawsuit \nconsidered, the United States o£ \nAmerica,  intervenor herei·n,  i·nter \njects no  objection to ordering \nimplementation o£  thi.s plan,  as is \n:more .£ully .set out in its response \nriled herein .. \" \nThe Board £iled its response to the report .and \nrecommendation on July 3,  19 73.

Plainti££s  concu=ed .i·n the \nentry o£ a  consent decree and  specifically noted that they had \ncon£er.red ·\"w:i th all members  of the Committee·\"  and concluded \nthat '\"there. are su££icient £acts extant and _stated within the \nplan to fully justify the continued existence\"  o£ the .one-race \nor predominantly one-race _school.s  and,  therefore,  urged ·the \nCourt :to approve  the 1973 'Plan .in toto. . \nIn the above  described posture., ·the Court .on  July 20., \n1973,  entered its order implementing the  1973 ~lan and the \nUnited States executed the ·order as i.s hereinabove set forth. \nThe  commit·tee  stated in the plan that it was  essentially a \ncompromise _proposal favored by both black and white  segments \nof the community  as  an  alternative to massive bussing.  In \neffect,  it retained the neighborhood  school concept with rigid \ngeographic  zoning,  some ·school closings,  and it was  supplemented \nby  a  majority to minority transfer system.  The  plan  also \nmandated achievement of a  50%  black-50%  white  ratio of employees \nat all levels of  faculty,  staff and  administration. \nOn  September  9, 1976,  after having operated under the \n1973 Plan .for more  than three years,  the Board :filed a  motion \n3 \n25-48 \n\nCase 5:65-cv-11055-EEF   Document 1-2   Filed 09/20/06   Page 6 of 57 PageID #:  50\nseeking to have the System declared unitary and the pending \ncase  dismissed.  The United States took the position that the \nquestions  of unitariness and  dismissal were not properly before \nthe  Court  and  that the United States would be  entitled to notice \nand a  hearing on  those questions before any  such orders were \nentered..  Evidence  on  the 13oard '.s  compliance with the .1973 \n:Plan was taken before .a  Special Master appointed by  the Court. . \nThe motion was  taken under advisement by the Court and,  after \napproximately sixteen months,  on December :29,  1.977,  the Court \nissued .a  written opinion  and  judgment declaring the System to \nbe unitary. . \nOn  January  9,  1978, the United States filed a  timely \nmotion to .amend the judgment and findings  of the Court  upon \nwhich  the judgment was based.  The private p-laintiffs .have made \nno  additional appearance or ;filed additional pleadings in this \ncase- In its motion,  the Government  asked for a  further .hearing \nana sought to have  the judgment :rendered on December 29, 1977, \nvacated.  .The  filing of these .motions :by  the Government sus_pended \nthe finality of the judgment· pending a  final deci.sion  on them. \nThe  United States took the position,  disputed .by the :Board,  that \nit had not agreed to the 1973 l'lan  as .a  \"final plan'\"  of integration \nand had specifically reserved its .right to question the constit u \ntionality of the  student desegregation ·portions of the plan..  It \nfurther contended that all of the acceptable  \"tools·\"  of desegregation \nhad not been  considered by the bi·-racial committee and,  hence.,  the \ncontinued existence of a  large number of predominantly  one-race \nschools in the parish could not be  constitutionally  justified. \nOn  January 2-4.,  1978,  the Board filed its opposition \nto the motions of the United States contending that the 1973 \nl'lan was  implemented pursuant to an  agreement  among  all parties \nto the litigationJ  constituted a  final plan of integration \nunder  a  consent decree and was  binding on  all parties.  The \nBoard further contended that if the United States was  allowed \nto recede -from such .agreement,  then the System .should be \nrelieved of all obligations under the 1973 Plan. . \n2549 \n4 \n\nCase 5:65-cv-11055-EEF   Document 1-2   Filed 09/20/06   Page 7 of 57 PageID #:  51\nIn addi·tion to ·the opposition,  the Board £iled .a \nmotion for partial relief from the 1973 Plan,  in which  it \nalleged that the continued requirement of a  50%  black-50% \nwhite ratio in the .hiring and promotion o£ faculty,  staff and \nadministration was  unconstitut-ional  and in violation of \ndecisions  of the United  States Court of Appeals £or the Fifth \nCircuit...  The :Board,  therefore.,  requested an order relieving \nit £rom the ohligation to utilize employment and promotional \npolicies designed to maintain a  strict racial ratio in £aculty, \nadministration and staf£..  The Board  sought to be  allowed to \nhire and promote on the basis o£ mer.it   and  ability,  without \nregard to race .and without discrimination .. \nWhile the above-described motions have .been pending \nbefore this Court.,  the Board and the United States have engaged \nin extensive negotiations to attempt ·to  ar.rive at .a plan by \nwhich to compromise  their .disputes, thereby minimizing the risk \n.and expense.,  as well as  delay,  inherent in protracted desegre-\ngation litigation..  The ~Board and the United States now have \narrived at .a ·plan that is satisfactory to both parties in \nlight of their re.spective adverse contentions and the evaluation \no.f  all pertinent :factors..

Thereafter.,  a  steady decline of public .school \nenrollment occurred so that by the end of the 1972-73  school \nyear there were :S 1 ,27 3  students,  50%  of whom were black and \n50%  of whom were white..  Subsequent to the implementation of \nthe 1973 Plan student enrollment in the System continued its \npre-19 73  decline  so that .by the beginning of the 19 8 0-19 81 \nschool year,  the ~tudent population of the System had fallen \nto 45,-469  of -whom  55..1%  were black and  44.9%  were white.

At ·the  same time the \nparties and t1le  Court recogni.ze that the .steps to be taken under \nthis Decree  are  designed to desegregate  students, both .black \nand white,  and that these and .any other steps that may be \nadopted pursuant to this ·Decree have been  and will be ·formulated \n.so  as to impose the burdens  of desegregation as  eguitably as \npossible upon black and white  students.  On  the basis  of _past \nexperience, moreover,,  it seems  evident ·that the historica.l \npattern of increasing black enrollment in the System as  a \nwhole  combined with the  steps taken pursuant to this Decree \nmay  produce higher black enrollments  at certain schools  in the \n:future than recited in this Decree,  which bases  its projections \non  1980-1981 enrollments .. \nIn the  course  of the many proposals  and counterproposals \npresented by the United States and the Board,  the United States \nand the Board have  considered all of the available tools for \n2551 \n6 \n\nCase 5:65-cv-11055-EEF   Document 1-2   Filed 09/20/06   Page 9 of 57 PageID #:  53\n. desegregation with  respect  to  schools in the System. \nSpecifically.,  the United .States  and its outside experts \nand the _Board  and its staff have  considered bussing.,  pairing, \nclustering,  the redesignation of district lines,  redesigna \ntion of feeder systems  o:f  secondary .school·s,  magnet proposals., \nschool  closings and other tools of desegregation.  llased on \nconsideration of the geographic  isolation of certain schools, \nthe practicalities of the adverse effect on already desegre \ngated schools of efforts to desegregate certain other schools, \nthe innovative and  special programs to be  implemented .by  the \nBoard  and the .special efforts ·to be undertaken to provide \nvoluntary desegregative options for .. students remaining  in \none-race  schools,  among others,  it is the considered judgment \nof the United .States and  the .Board that.all possible means  of \ndesegregation have been explored and will be implemented with \nthe greatest degree  of :potential success and feasibility under \nthe terms .and conditions of this Decree. . \n·The  pa-rties  desire to -resolve this suit without the \nnecessity of :further cos-tly  and p-rotracted li·tigation. \nAccordingly they have .agreed,  as witnessed by the  signatures \nof thei-r authori:zed counsel  and representatives below,  to the \nentry o:f  this C:msent D.ecree :Ln resolution of all o£ the \nissues in thi.s  case which remain in .dispute .. \nIt is the determination of  this Court,  on the basi·s \nof its familiarity with this case and the System,  in general, \nand on  the basis o£  the evidence previously adduced and  the \nopinion previously rendered,  that ·the plan £or the System \nembodied in this Decree is reasonable and appropriate £or the \nadditional desegregation of the .System,  .and  upon  its successful \nimplementation will in fact and in law create a  unitary school \nsystem. for Caddo 'Parish .. \nThe United States has taken an active role in this \ncase as plaintiff-inte-rvenor to represent the interest of the \nUnited States~  Because no original plainti£f had taken  an \nactive role in pursuing this case for  several years,  on \n7 \n2552 \n\nCase 5:65-cv-11055-EEF   Document 1-2   Filed 09/20/06   Page 10 of 57 PageID #:  54\nJune 3,  1980.,  this Court entered a  Minute Entry,  which was \nsent to all former counsel of record for  the original \nplaintiffs and some  others,  stating that if no  appearance \nwere made  by or on behalf of any o:E  the original plaintiffs \nor other private parties by .July .3,  1980,  the Court would \nconsider that \"the plaintiffs acquiesce in having  their \ninterests represented by the United States  as  plaintiff \nintervenor\".

This action was\nfiled in the United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Louisiana on May 4, 1965, by six Negro chil-\ndren residing with their parents in Caddo Parish, Louisi-\n1/\nana. The complaint sought an injunction against the\n1 / Record on appeal, p. 1. This record will hereafter\nbe referred to as \"R.\"\n- 1 -\n\nCaddo Parish school officials from discriminating against\nthe plaintiffs and other members of their class in Caddo\nParish in the operation of the public schools under their\njurisdiction (R. 1-10).\nOn June 14, 1965, following a hearing on the fac-\ntual allegations of the complaint and of defendants'\nanswer (R. 63-132), the district court entered a decree\npermanently enjoining the defendants from continuing\nto operate a compulsory bi-racial school system in Caddo\n2/\nParish. The court ordered the defendants to submit a\nplan within 30 days to accomplish this object \"with all\ndeliberate speed,\" beginning with the 1965-66 school\nyear. The court specifically deferred ruling on the\nquestion of desegregation of teaching and administrative\npersonnel.(cid:9) (R. 133-136.)\nOn July 7, 1965, the defendants submitted their\nplan for desegregating the Caddo Parish schools (R. 138-150).\nOn July 19, 1965, the United States filed its motion for\nleave to intervene as a party plaintiff pursuant to section\n2/ The Caddo Parish school system contains approximately\n55,000 students of whom approximately 24,000 are Negroes\n(R. ].70, 189).(cid:9) These students attend 72 schools which are\norganized according to race and geographical attendance\nareas (R. 170-171, 74-75, 69, 76, 78, 79, 84, 201, 251-253).\nForty schools serve grades 1 through 6; nine serve grades\n1 through 8; three, grades 1 through 12; one, grades 9\nthrough 12; five, grades 7 through 12; nine, grades 7 through\n9; and five grades 10 through 12 (R. 59).\n\n902 of the Civil Righte Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000h-2)\n(R. 151). Accompanying this motion were the Attorney\nGeneral's certification pursuant to this statute and\nobjections by the United States to the proposed plan\nof desegregation (R. 152-155). The plaintiffs' objec-\ntions to the School Board's plan were filed on July 21,\n1965 (R. 158-160).\nOn August 3, 1965, the district court denied the)\nmotion of the United States to intervene, ruling that'\nit \"comes entirely too late.\" (R. 166.) On the same\nday, the court heard evidence on the plan and the objec-\ntions thereto (R. 161-290) and then entered an order\napproving the plan, with modifications (R. 291-298).\nThis order was amended by the court on August 20, 1965\n(R. 302-304) after a motion to vacate and reconsider\nwas filed by the plaintiffs on August 17, 1965 (R. 299).\nOn October 4, 1965, the United States appealed\nfrom the order denying it leave to intervene (R. 305).\nThe desegregation plans in the court below. The\norder presently appealed from must be considered against\nthe background of the plan originally submitted by the\nappellees and of the original order entered by the court\nbelow approving that plan.\n\n4\n1. Appellees' original plan. The plan submitted by the\nappellees to the court below on July 7, 1965, begins\nwith a request to delay the start of desegregation in\nthe area outside the City of Shreveport until the open-\ning of the school year in 1967-68 (R. 138-139). The\nplan goes on to provide that all students may go to the\nschool they attended last year or the one closest to\ntheir residence that is attended predominantly by mem-\nbers of their race. \"Desegregation\"would be accomplished\nfor the 1965-66 school year by means of permitting stu-\ndents in the first and twelfth grades in the Shreveport\nschools to apply for transfer or assignment \"to the\nschool nearest their residence\" (R. 141). Their applica-\ntions would be judged on the basis of several limiting\ncriteria, including age of the pupils, available space,\nscholastic aptitude, academic preparations, \"ability,\"\nand \"compatibility\" of the applicant (R. 146-148).\nApplications could be made in person at the Superintend-\nent's office (R. 142). Provision was made for notice of\nthe plan's operation by mail to affected students at the\nend of each school year (R. 144). The plan would apply\nto all grades throughout the system by the fall of 1970\n(R. 141).\n\n- 5 -\n2. Court ordered plan of August 3, 1965. After the\nhearing on the objections to the School Board plan, the\ncourt below entered its order of August 3, 1965, setting\nforth its approved desegregation plan (R. 291-298). This\nplan, the first adopted by the court, provided that\n\"[a]ll initial pupil assignments made for the school\nyear 1965-66 will be considered adequate\" subject, how-\never, to a right of students in the 1st and 12th grades\nin schools throughout the system to apply for assignment\nand transfer to a school of their choice. (R. 291-292.)\nNotice of this right would be published in a local news-\npaper (R. 292). Applications for transfer were to be\nmade available, upon request, by the School Board (R. 292).\nThe court's order provided that the School Board in ruling\nupon applications for transfer, could apply several cri-\nteria including age of the pupils and availability of\nspace (R. 293).(cid:9) In addition, the plan stated that \"[l]n\nthe event a transfer or assignment is requested to a par-\nticular school, but it develops that there is available\nspace in another school, in all respects comparable to\nthe one to which transfer or assignment is requested,\ncloser to the applicant's residence, the School Board\nmay, if it deems it advisable, make the transfer or\n\n6\nassignment to the comparable school closest to the pupil's\nresidence, rather than to the school to which the trans-\nfer or assigntalent was requested\" (R. 294).(cid:9) The court\nadded a requirement that new students entering the school\nsystem for the first time, regardless of grade, would be\noffered a choice of attending the formerly all-white or\nformerly all-Negro school closest to their residence\n(R. 295).\nThe plan further stated that \"[c]ommencing with\nthe school year 1966-67 all initial assignments of pupils\nto the first, second, eleventh and twelfth grades ...\nshall be made purely and simply on the basis of indivi-\ndual choice ... reserving to the School Board(cid:9) the\nright to place a pupil in a comparable school closer to\nthe pupil's residence than is the school of his choice.\"\n(R. 296.) No provision is made for the procedure to be\nfollowed in making the \"initial assignments\" except for\nthe statement that (R.297) \"[t]he method of initial assignment\nherein provided for will, of course, be subject to all\nreasonable procedural requirements that may be adopted\nand promulgated by the(cid:9) Board.\"\nAs in the original plan proposed by the appellees,\nno provision was made for faculty and staff desegregation,\nor for desegregation of services and programs sponsored\nby the school system.\n\n7\nThe dual school districts on racial lines would\nbe abolished with respect to each grade as it was reached\nby the_PlAA DIA__296). All_grades would be reached--\nby the fall of 1968 (R. 296).\n3. Amended court  plan of August 20, 1965. Upon plain-\ntiffs' motion to vacate and reconsider, and following\nthis Court's remand in the Bossier case with instructions\nto reconsider in the light of Singleton and Price (R. 301),\nthe district court amended its plan so as to increase the\nnumber of grades to be affected in each of the coming\nschool years (R. 303-304). As amended by the district\ncourt, the plan reached the first, second, eleventh and\ntwelfth grades beginning with the fall of 1965 and four\nadditional grades in each of the two succeeding school\nyears so that all grades would be affected by the begin-\nning of the 1967-68 school year. The district court, in\namending its order to comply with this Court's directive,\nstill made no specific provision for the procedure to be\nfollowed in the making of the \"initial assignment\" de-\nscribed in the order; made no provision for non-discrimi-\nnatory use of the services, facilities, activities and\nprograms sponsored by the school, and failed to require\nany steps for the elimination of racial segregation of\nfaculty and staff.\n\n- 8\nSPECIFICATION OF ERRORS\nThe order of the district court of August 20,\n1965 approving and ordering into effect the amended plan\nof desegregation for the Caddo Parish schools errs in\nthat:\n1. It fails to include specific provisions\nguaranteeing true freedom of choice in the administra-\ntion of the plan.\n2. It fails to require desegregation of faculty\nand staff.\n3. It fails to prohibit racial discrimination\nin \nagainst Negro students  formerly all-white schools in\nconnection with services, facilities, activities and\nprograms conducted by or affiliated with the school sys-\ntem.\n4. The order fails to provide for desegregation\nof the seventh grade, which is an initial grade in second-\nary schools, for the 1966-67 school year.\n5. The order fails to provide that Negro students\nin grades not reached by the plan shall be allowed to\ntransfer to formerly all-white schools upon request.\n\nARGUMENT\nI\nA. The court-ordered plan lacks sufficient specificity.\nThe order of the court below requires the appellees\nto effect a transition from a compulsory dual system of\nschools based upon race to a system in which the choice\nof the student or his parents shall determine the school\nof attendance. 'The need for specificity in the new system\nshould be apparent. Students, parents, school staff and\nthe community at large have long been conditioned to a\nsystem in which race is the determining factor. Each\nschool has necessarily acquired the stigma of being either\n\"white\" or \"Negro.\" To convert this system, in all of\nits aspects, to one in which race will no longer be a\nfactor will at best be a difficult process if the new system\nis to rely for its opezation upon the free volition of\nschool patrons and upon administrators who have long been\nconditioned to the racial system.\nThis Court recognized these difficulties when in\nStell v. Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education, 333\nF. 2d 55, 65 (1964), it said:\n\n- 10 -\nThe rule is now firmly established in\nthis circuit, Gibson v. Board. of Public\nInstruction of Dade County, Fla., 5\nCir., 1959, 272 F. 2d 763; Evers v.\nJackson Municipal Separate School\nDistrict, supra, that desegregation\nmust be accomplished in the context of\nall inhibitions, legal or otherwise,\nserving to enforce segregation having\nbeen removed to the extent that Negro\npupils are afforded a reasonable and\nconscious opportunity to apply for\nadmission to any school for which they\nare otherwise eligible without regard\nto their race or color, and to have\nthat choice fairly considered by the\nenrolling authorities. This is the\nfirst step. 3/\n3/ The following language of the District Court for\nthe Western District of Virginia, in Kier v. County \nSchool Board of Augusta County, Va., ITT-F. Supp. 239,\nITITTW6-7-1-766), -is equally apt:\nUnquestionably, to be constitutionally\nacceptable, a freedom of choice plan will\nimpose upon the school boards additional\nduties not required under a geographic\nplan. The ground rules must be laid in a\nway which will not discourage desegrega-\ntion, and students and their parents must\nbe fully informed of their choices. .. .\nWhere, as here, the school authorities have\nchosen to adopt a freedom of choice plan\n\nThus, as stated by the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit in Wheeler v. Durham City Board of \nEducation, 346 F. 2d 768, 773 (C.A. 4, 1965):\nA freedom of choice system to warrant\napproval, must operate to prevent\ndiscrimination and not merely to\ncorrect conditions which have been\ndeliberately created by unlawfully\ndiscriminatory procedures. (Emphasis\nby the court.)\nThe generality of the language in the plans\nsubmitted by the appellees and ordered by the lower\ncourt in this case were clearly such as to permit\nmisunderstanding of the specific nature of appellees'\nobligations. Such misunderstanding cannot only permit\nevasion, conscious or unconscious, but necessarily\nbreeds further litigation to give specific content\nto the plan's general provisions.\n3/ (Cont'd. )\nwhich imposes upon the individual\nstudent, or his parent, the duty of\nchoosing in the first instance the\nschool which he will attend (and where\nthe burden of desegregating is imposed\nupon the individual Negro student or his\nparent), it is essential that the ground\nrules of the plan be drawn with meticulous\nfairness.\n\n- 12 -\nThe order entered by the district court on\nJune 14, 1965, enjoined the appellees from \"con-\ntinuing to assign students to schools with regard\nto race or color\" and from \"continuing to operate\na compulsory bi-racial school system in Caddo\nParish, Louisiana.\" This order, properly read,\nwould appear to require the appellees to fully meet\ntheir constitutional obligation to eliminate racial\ndiscrimination and the vestiges of past racial dis-\ncrimination in the operation of their schools. In\nresponse to this order, however, the appellees sub-\nmitted a plan which clearly misconceived the extent\nand nature of their obligations. Their plan as\nsubmitted would have permitted the existing system\nof assigning pupils to continue indefinitely, subject\nonly to a limited right on the part of students to seek\ntransfer to schools from which they were initially\nexcluded upon the basis of their race.\nThe district court's Order on Plan for \nDesegregation of August 3, 1965 did little to disabuse\n\n- 13 -\nthe appellees of their misconceptions regarding the\nnature of their constitutional duty. Although the\ncourt removed some of the criteria set forth in the\nproposed plan and purported to base assignments for\nthe school years 1966-67 and 1967-68 on \"freedom of\nchoice\" it failed to set forth specific procedures\nthat would make it clear that initial assignments were\nto be made without regard to race and that the burden\nwould not be left upon Negro school patrons to obtain\nassignments to schools to which white patrons were\nautomatically assigned. The uncertainty of the plan\nwas compounded by the district court in introducing\na new element - the right of the School Board to deny\na choice of school upon the ground that there is a\n\"comparable\" school closer to the student's residence\n(R. 296).\nPlaintiffs' motion to vacate and reconsider\nfollowed and relied on this Court's remand in United \nStates v. Bossier Parish School Board, No. 22863, in\nwhich the same district court was instructed to recon-\nsider in the light of Singleton and Price. This directive,\nas we read it, should have caused the district court to\nenter an amended order with sufficient specificity to\n\n- 14-\ncure the defects in the order appealed from. Singleton \nand Price, in effect, direct lower courts to draw upon\nthe expertise of the Office of Education, as set forth\nin the Commissioner's Guidelines for school desegregation,\nin framing decrees. The Guidelines do in fact set forth\nrequirements for desegregation plans under \"free choice\"\nsystems with as much specificity as could be desired in\na court order.\nDespite this Court's directive the lower court\nmade no hJange.s in its order other than to extend the\ncoverage of the plan to an increased number of school\ngrades. The fatal lack of s pecificity remained. Its\nresult in practice soon became apparent. Only one (1)\nof the approximately 24,450 Negroes in the system, a\nsystem containing the third largest City in the State,\nwas enrolied by the appellees in formerly all-white\nschools for the 1965-66 school year. See affidavit\nof St. John Barrett a ppended to the Motion To  Consoli-\ndate And Expedite Appeals filed in this case on\nApril 4, 1966. This can hardly be regarded as an\nadeouate first step in desegregating a school system\nat this ate date.\n)\nA freedom of choice plan which is non-specific\nin detail, not only fails to meet legal requirements,\n\n- 15-\nbut will necessarily breed further litigation and\nencourage multiplicity of appeals. The lack of\nspecificity in the order in this case left a multitude\nof questions for future litigation. We will now touch\non some of these questions.\nHow shall notice be given students and parents\nof their rights under the plan? Shall it be by indivi-\ndual mailed notice? Shall it be by publication in a\nnewspaper? Shall it he by delivering a notice to the\nstudents in school? What should be the text of the\nnotice? Should the entire plan be set forth? When\nshould notice be given? Should it be given to all\nstudents and\n\n- 16-\nparents or only to Negroes? None of these questions\nis answered in the court's order. Any of them\ncould be a matter of future dispute between the\nparties.\nWhat type of form should be used when\nstudents or parents exercise their choice of schools?\nHow and where should forms be made available to the\nstudents and parents: Should they be sent to the\nparents? Who must sign the choice form? May the\nchooser be required to state his reasons for\nthe choice? None of these questions are answered in\nthe order of the lower court, although these\nmechanics relating to the exercise of the choice\nmust necessarily determine whether a \"free\" choice\nis being accorded.\nMust a choice form be executed on behalf of\nevery student enrolling in school? Must such a\nchoice be exercised each year? If a yearly choice\nis not required may it nonetheless he exercised at\n\n- 17 -\nthe option of the student? If a choice is not\nrequired on behalf of every student, how will non-\nchoosers be assigned? Will prior racial assignments\nbe automatically continued absent the exercise of\na contrary choice? No answer to these questions is\nfound in the court's decree although the answers\nare vital to a determination of whether the dual\nracial system is being eliminated?\nIf limitations of school capacity preclude\ngranting the choice of every student, which students\nwill be given priority to attend the schools of their\nchoice? Will white students who have previously\nattended paruicular schools by reason of their race\nbe given preference over Negroes who have been ex-\ncluded by reason of their race? If not, how will\npriority be determined? Will it be based upon date\nof application? Will it be based upon proximity of\nresidence? Will it be based upon level of achieve-\nment, availability of transportation, enrollment\nof brothers or sisters in the same school, or on\n\n- 18 -\nfactors yet to be determined in the discretion\nof the School Board? These questions, which go\nto thevery heart of a free choice plan, were left\nby the district court to future litigation.\nWhat of students whose choice of school must\nbe rejected because of limitation of school capacity?\nWill they be given a second choice? What will be the\nbasis kor such choice? Will they be assigned to the\ncloses school, or, perhaps, to the school having\nthe mo t unused capacity? Or will they be assigned\nback to schools which they have previously attended\nby re.a on of their race? Again, these questions are\nunansw red by the district court.\n' What standards will guide the School Board in\nrejecting the choice of a student in order to assign\nhim to a \"comparable\" school that is closer to his\nresidence? What schools are \"comparable?\" Within\nthe meaning of the order, is a traditionally all-\nNegro school \"comparable\" to a traditionally all-white\nschool having substantially equal facilities? In\n\n- 19 •-\nimplementing this rule, may the School Board\nreject the choice of any Negro student seeking\nenrollment in a traditionally white school that\nis farther from his residence than the closest\nNegro school? Again, no answer is to be found\nin the order of the district court.\nVarious of the other district courts in the\nFifth Circuit have considered and resolved virtually\nall of the questions just raised. Although it may\nbe that no single district court has considered and\nresolved all of these questions in the same case, a\ncourt clearly could do so with facility by drawing\nupon the already formulated standards and procedures\nset forth in the Commissioner's Guidelines. Indeed,\nin Singleton and Price, this Court has already\nsuggested that the district courts do so. We submit\nthat this was the course that the district court\nin this case should have followed.\n\n20 -\n- \nB. The plan fails to contain a provision\ndesigned to eliminate the racial segregation\nof faculty and staff.\nThe Caddo Parish school system contains 3,700\nteachers and other staff personnel, all of whom are\nassigned,on the basis of race, to schools attended by\nstudents of the same race as themselves (R. 170,  74-75).\nDiscrimination is employed in the hiring of teachers. 4/\nIn addition to staff working in the schools themselves,\nthe Parish maintains a staff of fourteen or fifteen\nsupervisors with offices located at the \"instructional\ncenter.\" Se%.eral of these are Negroes. Negro super-\nvisors are assigned to supervise Negro schools only.\n(R. lob.)\nSchool districts that have operated dual racial\nschool systems have the obligation under Brown v. Board \nof Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955), to \"effectuate a\ntransition to a racially non-discriminatory school\nsystem!' Racial segregation of teachers as well as\n1f \nsegregation  students has traditionally been one of\nthe hallmarks of the dual school system. The transi-\ntion to a nor-discriminatory system cannot be effected\n4/ Thus, Superintendent Perry testified that (R. 100)\n\"Tr\n[o]f course, we have more white teachers because we\nhave a much bigger number of white children.\"\nNWT\": \"-7 1(cid:9) '1(cid:9) 91,11T,(cid:9) 7111111\n\n- 21 -\nuntil faculty, as well as students, have been\ndesegregated.\nHere, the district court, although enjoining\nthe appellees from continuing to operate a bi-racial\nschool system, specifically deferred ruling on the\nquestion of faculty desegregation \"until the plan for\ndesegregation of pupils, as finally approved, either\nhas been accomplished or has made substantial progress.\"\nThis ruling was clearly erroneous.\nThe inclusion of a provision in the plan designed\nto eliminate race as a factor in the employment and\nallocation of faculty and staff at this late date is\nessential. Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate \nSchool District, 355 F. 2d 865 (C.A. 5, 1966); Bradley \nv. School Board, Richmond, Virginia, 382 U.S. 103 (1965);\nRogers v. Paul, 382 U.S. 198 (1965). As the Court wrote\nin Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District,\nsupra, at 870:\nIn view of the necessity that the\nJackson School system be totally\ndesegregated by September 1967, we\nregard it as essential that the plan\nprovide an adequate start toward\nelimination of race as a basis for the\nemployment and allocation of teachers,\nadministrators, and other personnel.\n\n- 22 -\nA desegregation plan, if it is to comply with\nthe rule announced in Singleton v. Jackson Municipal \nSeparate School District, supra, must (1) require\nthe Board to cease its practice of hiring and placing\nteachers on the basis of race, and (2) define a program\ndesigned to correct the effects of past discrimina-\ntory hiring and assignment practices. 5/ See the\nRevised Sta ement, 45 CFR 181.13. 6/\nWhere a school board is operating under a plan\nutilizing a freedom of choice (or transfer) method,\nthe desegregation of faculty and staff is particularly\nimportant. As the district court said in Kier v.\nCounty School Board of Augusta County, Virginia,\n5/ As the Court said in United States v. Duke, 332 F.\n7d 759, 768-69 (C.A. 5, 1964):\nAn appropriate remedy . . . should undo\nthe results of past discrimination as\nwell as prevent future inequality of\ntreatment. A court of equity is not\npowerless to eradicate the effects of\nformer discrimination.\n6/ The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\nrecently announced new school desegregation guide-\nlines (31 F.R. 5623-5634, April 9, 1966). They are\ncited herein as Revised Statement and appear at the\nend of this brief.\n\n- 23 -\n249 F. Supp. 239, 246 (W.D. Va. 19b6):\nIt is not enough to open the pre\nviously all-white schools to Negro\nstudents who desire to go there\nwhile all-Negro schools continue to\nbe maintained as such.

This is particularly true under a freedom\nof choice (or transfer) system, for any such dis-\ncrimination or segregation would inevitably inhibit\nfree choice.\n8/ Indeed, before Brown, where the state provided one\nschool for both races, it was prohibited from dis-\ncriminating on the basis of race in connection with the\nschool services, facilities and programs.

The plan fails to provide for undelayed\ndesegregation of grade seven. \nUnder the plan, grade seven will not be desegre-\ngated until the 1967-68 school year. This grade is the\ninitial grade of fourteen junior and senior high schools\nfor students graduating from forty elementary schools\n(R. 59). ilhus, a large percentage of the sixth grade\nstudents in the Parish necessarily begin a new school\nat the start of the seventh grade.\nSine July 1962, this Court has required that a\ndesegregat i on plan must clearly provide, without delay,\nfor the admission of new pupils entering the first\ngrade, or coming into the County for the first time, on\n[\na nonracial basis.

The rationale for this require-\nment is tha although Brown, for reasons of administrative\nconvenience, permitted school officials to temporarily\nleave students where they were, it did not allow such\n\n- 27 -\nofficials to add to the existing segregation by\nracially assigning students who are new to the system.\nThis rationale applies equally to students who are\nnecessarily beginning new schools but who have been\nin the system in the past. Racial assignment of any\nstudent entering a school for the first time \"creates\"\nsegregation in relation to that school which did not\nexist before.\n\n9 8\nE. The plan fails to contain a provision \nallowing Negro students in non-desegregated\ngrades to transfer to schools from which \nthey have been excluded because of race.\nal\nIn  Singleton v. Jackson Municip  Separate School \nDistrict, 355 F.2d 865, 869 (C.A. 5, 1966), the Court\nwrote:\nThe school children in still-segregated\ngrades in Negro schools are there by assign-\nment based on their race. This assignment\nwas unconstitutional. They have an absolute\nright, as individuals, to transfer to schools\nfrom which they were excluded because of\ntheir race.\nIt is true that this Singleton decision was\nrendered after the order of the district court in this\ncase was issued. But, since the Singleton transfer rule\nis based on a constitutional principle, and is not merely\nan aspect of transitional relief, it should have been\nincluded in the plan. In any event, it is, of course,\nproper for this Court now to require its inclusion in\nthe plan\n\n- 29 -\nII\nThe District Court Improperly Denied the \nUnited States Leave to Intervene. \nA . After the Board submitted its desegregation\nplan but before the plaintiffs filed objections to the plan\nand before the hearing on the objections was held, the\nUnited States moved to intervene pursuant to section 902\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000 h-2).\nThe motion was denied by the district court on the grounds\nthat it was made too late (R. 151-166).\nSection 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42\nU.S.C. 2000 h-2) provides:\nWhenever an action has been\ncommenced in any court of the United\nStates seeking relief from the denial\nof equal protection of the laws under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution on account of race, color,\nreligion, or national origin, the\nAttorney General for or in the name of\nthe United States may intervene in such\naction upon timely application if the\nAttorney General certifies that the case\nis of general public importance. In\n\n- 30 -\nsuch action the United States shall be\nentitled to the same relief as if it\nhad instituted the action.\nTimeliness is not measured simply by the lapse\nof time between institution of the suit and the applica-\ntion for intervention. 2/ Indeed, it is error under\nsome circumstances to deny intervention after final\njudgment in the district court. Wolpe v. Poretsky, 144\nF.2d 505, 508 (C.A.D.C., 1944); Pellegrino v. Nesbit,\n203 F.2d 463, 465 (C.A. 9, 1953); Cuthill v. Ortman-\nMiller Machine Co., 216 F.2d 336 (C.A. 7, 1954); United \nStates Casualty Co. v. Taylor, 64 F.2d 521, 527 (C.A. 4),\n1933). Such factors as, whether the issues have been fully\ndrawn (Kozak v. Wells, 278 F.2d 104, 109 (C.A. 8, 1960),\nwhether the applicant's delay in attempting to intervene\nwas justifi d (Clark v. Sandusky, 205 F.2d 915, 918-919\n9/ Plaintiffs' complaint was filed May 4, 1965. Defend-\nants answered on May 24, 1965 and on July 19,1965, the\nUnited States moved to intervene.\n\n- 31 -\n(C.A. 7, 1953), whether the applicant diligently filed\nfor leave to intervene following notice of facts\ncreating the desire to intervene (pyle-National Co. \nv. Amos, 172 F.2d 425, 428 (C.A. 7, 1949), and whether\nthere is a necessity to protect the right of appeal\nso as to assure adequate representation of all claims\nand interests involved (Wolpe v. Poretsky, supra;\nPellegrino v. Nesbit, supra; Cuthill v. Ortman-Miller\nMachine Co., supra; United  States Casualty Co. v. Taylor,\nsupra) are relevant in measuring the applicant's\ntimeliness.\nThe United States applied for intervention twelve\ndays after the Board's proposed desegregation plan was\nsubmitted. To hold that intervention at this juncture\nwas untimely would require the United States to intervene\nbefore a plan for desegregation could be studied in light\nof constitutional standards. It is doubtful that Congress\nintended such a result by conditioning intervention by\nthe United States on filing a timely application.\nMoreover, intervention, after the proposed plan\nhas been submitted for the purpose of objecting to the\n\n- 32 -\nplan would not prejudice any of the parties to the suit.\nThis is the time objections are to be filed by the\noriginal parties. Nor would delay result from inter-\nvention at this point. Indeed, the United States filed\nits objections to the Board's plan with its motion to\nintervene two days before the original plaintiffs filed\ntheir objections. The attempt to intervene, thus, came\n1\nat a convenient and reasonable point in the suit.\nB. In opposing the motion to intervene, the\ndefendants argued that intervention was sought for the\npurpose of impeaching a decree already made, namely the\ndistric court's decree of June 14, 1965 (R. 163).\nEven weL e this contention accurate, it would not be a\nvalid Isis for denying intervention in this case.\nEx Par(cid:9)Jordan, 94 U.S. 248 (1876); 4 Moore's Federal \nPracti e 121 (2d ed. 1963).1 / But this contention is\n1g/ Under such circumstances the intervenor might properly\nbe pre luded from impeaching this decree, a consideration\ndistin t from determining the timeliness of intervention.\nMoore' Federal Practice explains:\n\n- 33 -\nsimply untrue. The district court's decree of June 14,\n1965 required the submission of a desegregation plan\nwhich would comply with the constitutional standards\nestablished by this Court. The motion filed by the\nUnited States to intervene was based on the theory that\nthe Board's proposed plan did not comply with the court's\ndecree in that it failed to meet these standards.11/\n(Cont'd.)\nIt should he pointed out that the rule\nas to prior decrees is not a rule which\nregulates the right of the petitioner to\nintervene, but nevertheless where the\nright to intervene is discretionary, one\nfactor in denying intervention will be the\nadministrative inconvenience that inter-\nvention might cause, or the fact that inter-\nvention for the sole purpose of attacking\na prior decree would he useless. Where the\nright to intervene is absolute, however, it\nis particularly important that the problems\nhe kept separate. Thus, in Ex Parte. Jordan,\nwhere bondholders desired to intervene and\nto obiect to certain prior orders and final\ndecrees rendered prior to their admission\nin the proceeding, the Supreme Court in\nallowing intervention distinguished between\nthe right to intervene and the possibility\nof contesting the prior orders and decrees.\n11/(cid:9) We urge the Court, if it considers that the United\nstates was improperly denied intervention, to consider\nour objections to the court-approved plan. Because the\ncourt-approved plan for Caddo Parish is substantially\nidentical to the court-approved plans for Bossier,\nJackson, and Claiborne Farishes and because the four\ncases are appealed from the same district court, we\nbelieve that they can be properly disposed of together.\n\n- 34 -\nRELIEF\nIn Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate \nSchool District, 348 F. 2d 729 (C.A. 5, 1965), this\nCourt said that \"The time has come for foot dragging\npublic school boards to move with celerity toward de-\nsegregation.\" The Court also said (348 F. 2d at 731):\nWe attach great weight to the standards\nestablished by the Office of Education.\nThe judiciary has of course functions\nand duties distinct from those of the\nexecutive department, but in carrying\nout a national policy we have the same\nobjective. There should be a close\ncorrelation, therefore, between the\njudiciary's standards in enforcing the\nnational policy requiring desegregation\nof public schools and the executive\ndepartment's standards in administering\nthis policy. Absent legal questions, the\nUnited States Office of Education is\nbetter qualified than the courts and is the\nmore appropriate federal body to weigh\nadministrative difficulties inherent in\nschool desegregation plans.\nIf in some district courts judicial guides\nfor approval of a school desegregation\nplan are more acceptable to the community\nor substantially less burdensome than H.E.W.\nguides,'school boards may turn to the federal\ncourts as a means of circumventing the H.E.W.\nrequirements for financial aid. Instead of a\nuniform policy relatively easy to administer,\nboth the courts and the Office of Education\nwould have to struggle with individual\n\n- 35 -\nschool systems on an ad hoc basis. If\njudicial standards are lower, recalcitrant\nschool boards in effect will receive a\npremimum for recalcitrance; the more the\nintransigence, the bigger the bonus.\nThe Court emphasized that (348 F. 2d at 731).\n\"As to details of the plan, the Board should be guided\nby the standards and policies announced by the United\nStates Office of Education in establishing standards\nfor compliance with the requirements of Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\"\nIn Price v. Denison Independent School District,\n348 F. 2d 1010, 1013-14 (C.A. 5, 1965), this Court re-\npeated its language in Singleton regarding the weight\nto be given the standards of the Office of Education\nand then went on to say:\nMore than that, we put these standards to\nwork. To avoid the temptation to recalci-\ntrant or reluctant school systems to seek\njudicial approval of a token plan as the\nbasis for Federal aid under alternative\n(1) for court plans, the Court held the\nJackson plan inadequate and directed that\na plan modeled after the Commissioner of\nEducatign's requirements (note 11, supra)\nbe submitted for the fall of 1965-66.\nThis signals what will be a frequent approach\nto these cases as they come to District Courts\nand thereafter this Court. These executive\nstandards, perhaps long overdue, are welcome.\nTo many, both on and off the bench, there was\ngreat anxiety in two major respects with the\nBrown approach. The first was that probably\nTai–The one and only time in American\n\n•\n- 36 -\nconstitutional history, a citizen --\nwas compelled to postpone the day of\neffective enjoyment of a constitutional\nright. In Ross v. Dyer, 5 Cir., 1963,\n312 F. 2d 191, 194, we_ recognizedthat\nunder \"a stair-step plan Negroes not in\nthe eligible classes continue to suffer\ndiscriminatory treatment.\" That there\ncan be a moratorium on the enjoyment of\nsuch rights runs counter to our notions\nof ordered liberty. Second, this in-\nescapably puts the Federal Judge in the\nmiddle of school administrative problems\nfor which he was not equipped and tended to\ndilute local responsibility for the highly\nlocal governmental function of running\na community's school under law and in ,\nkeeping with the Constitution.\nBy the 1964 Act and the action of HEW,\nadministration is largely where it ought\nto be--in the hands of the Executive and\nits agencies with the function of the\nJudiciary confined to those rare cases\npresenting justiciable, not operational\nquestions.\nThe Cort of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in\nKemp v. Beas1y, 352 F,, 2d 14 (C.A. 8, 1965), discussed\nthis Court's ling in Singleton insofar as it relates\nto reliance upon the H.E.W. guidelines. While agreeing\n\"that these standards must be heavily relied upon to\ndetermine what desegregation plans effectively eliminate\ndiscriminati+,\" the Court of Appeals for that circuit\nequally emphasized the responsibility of a federal court\nto exercise iis own judgment in determining constitutional\nissues.\" The court states its conclusion as follows,\n(352 F. 2d at 19): \nIimpurner  \nT,\n\n- 37 -\nTherefore, to the end of promoting\na degree of uniformity and discouraging\nreluctant school boards from reaping a\nbenefit from their reluctance the courts\nshould endeavor to model their standards\nafter those promulgated by the executive.\nThey are not bound, however, and when\ncircumstances dictate, the courts may\nrequire something more, less or different\nfrom the H.E.W. guidelines.\nAlthough the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit has not had occasion to consider the effect\nof the H.E.W. standards, district courts in that\ncircuit have relied on them. See Kier v. County\nSchool Board of Augusta County, 249 F. Supp. 239\n(W.D. Va., 1966); Wright v. County School Board of\nGreenville County, Civil Action No. 4263 (E.D. Va.,\nJanuary 27, 1966); Miller v. Clarendon County School\nDistrict No. 2, Civil Action No. 8752 (D. of S.C.,\nApril 21, 1966). In Miller, the most recent of these\ncases, the District Court for the District of South\nCarolina said, with reference to the H.E.W. standards:\nThose standards have been adopted and\napproved generally in other forums in\nthis circuit [citing Kier and Wright].\nThe orderly progress of desegregation\nis best served if school systems de-\nsegregating under court order are re-\nquired to meet the minimum standards\npromulgated for systems that desegregate\nvoluntarily. Without directing absolute\nadherence to the \"Revised Standards\"\nguidelines at this juncture, this court\nwill welcome their inclusion in any new,\namended, or substitute plan which may be\nadopted and submitted.\n\n•\n38 -\n- \nThis case, as well as each of the other school\ndesegregation cases now before this Court, illustrate\nthe need for this Court to review present judicial\nenforcement methods to the end that the orderly transi-\ntion to desegregation can be accomplished with a minimum\nof expenditure of judicial energy and with a maximum\ncorrelation between current desegregation standards and\ncurrent desegregation practices. We suggest that this\nend can best be realized by the adoption of a specific\ndecree to be entered in these cases by the district\ncourts. This is neither a fundamental change in\njudicial approach nor a departure from established\nstandards for desegregation. It would place in the\ncourts, as it must under our constitutional system the\nprimary responsibility for declaring the rights of the\npartier, and it would look to the Office of Education,\nrather than to the school boards, for administrative\nguidelines affecting desegregation so that (1) the\ncourt Will not be \"in the middle of school administra-\ntive problems,\" (2) uniformity in solving operational\n(3) \nproblems may be achieved, and  an efficient method\nof supervising school board performance can be realized.\nThis Court in cases involving voter discrimination\nhas approved the same type of relief here being urged.\n••••••p•••• .

In the Ward \ncase the Court in adopting the former decision there\nproposed (349 F. 2d at 805) said:\n[G]ood administration suggests that the\nproposed decree be indicated by an\nAppendix, not because of any apprehension\nthat the conscientious District Judge\nwould not faithfully impose every condition\nso obviously implied, but rather because of\nfactors bearing upon administration itself.\nIt is not possible, or even desirable, of\ncourse to achieve absolute uniformity.\nBut in this ever growing class of cases\nwhich have their genesis in unconstitutional\nlack of uniformity as between races, courts\nwithin this single circuit should achieve\na relative uniformity without further delay.\nSimilarly in a recent decision involving jury discrimination\nthis Court has emphasized \"the desirability of achieving\nuniformity of the handling of the substantial number of\ncases arising in this Court dealing with the same\nquestions of law.\" Scott v. Walker,(cid:9) F. 2d\n(C.A. 5, No. 20814(cid:9) decided March 31, 1966).\nThe necessary function of the court in desegregation\ncases is to guarantee that methods adopted for de-\nsegregation do not fall below constitutional limits.\nIt is not necessary to this function that the courts\ndefine every administrative detail necessarily involved\n\n- 40 -\nin day-to-day school administration. Under Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Executive Branch\nof the federal government must guarantee the fair use\nof federal funds by prescribing the ordinary administra-\n1\ntive details inevitably involved in any workable de-\nsegregation plan. For the courts to look to the\nregulations and guidelines of the Office of Education\ndoes not involve the abdication of any judicial function,\nbut instead is a rational method of enforcement of law\nunder a uniform national policy.\nThose regulations and guidelines are the product\nof the expertise of the Office of Education. They reflect\nthe experience and knowledge of persons involved in the\nday-to-day administration of the schools. The courts do\nnot have the staff, the facilities, or the time to under-\ntake with the same precision the function of defining the\nworkings of the desegregation mechanism.\nWith these considerations in mind we submit\nto the Court the proposed decree set forth in the\nappendlix filed in connection with this brief and the     \n.1 4. , .1(cid:9) 11111.1811.0\".....111.11.101111.111Mr......1111111111.11111.1111111\n\n-41.-\nsix other school desegregation cases before this\nCourt to which the government is a party.

The records\nin these cases fully support such relief. With the\nuse of this method of individual enforcement there\nwill no longer be occasion for the periodic submis-\nsion by school boards of \"desegregation plans,\" the\nhearing of objections to the plans and the submis-\nsion of amended plans. Instead, the school boards\nwill \nclearly understand their obligations, and will\nreport to the court on a periodic basis. It may be\nthat supplementary enforcement proceedings will\noccasionally be necessary, but hearings should be\nless frequent and should produce more effective\nresults in bringing current practices and current\nstandards closer. There will also be a higher prob-\nability that desegregation will proceed more uniformly\namong school districts under court orders and between\nsuch sch of districts and those desegregating on a\nvoluntar basis under the supervision of the Office\nof Educa ion.\nT e courts would continue to have the final\nresponsibility for fixing constitutional standards\nand for compliance with its decrees. The option is\n\n- 43 -\nstill open to any school board to come into court to\nprove that extraordinary circumstances compel modi-\nfication of one or another of the provisions of the\ndecree. The private plaintiffs and the United States\nalso retain their right, as they must, under our con-\nstitutional system and Title IV of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, to come into court when necessary to\nseek modification of or compliance with any provision\nin the decree.\nSpecial mention should be made of the faculty\nprovisions in the proposed decree and of the district\ncourt decisions that have decreed specific and\ndetailed relief on this subject.\nPrincipally within the past year, district\ncourts have been grappling with the problem of fram-\ning practical and effective relief for the desegrega-\ntion of faculty. Some courts in framing their decrees\nhave focused upon the specific results to be reached\nby reassignment of teachers who had theretofore been\nassigned solely upon the basis of their race. Dowell \nv. School Board of Oklahoma City, 244 F. Supp. 971\n(W.D. Okla. 1965), Kier v. County School Board of \nAugusta County, Virginia, 249 F. Supp. 239 N.D. Va.\n\n-44-\n1966). The orders entered in these cases required\nthat the defendant school boards assign any employed\nteachers and reassign already-employed faculty so\nthat the proportion of each race assigned to teach\nin each school will be the same as the proportion\nof teachers of that race in total teaching staff in\nthe system, or at least, of the particular school\nlevel in which they are employed. This type of re-\nlief is justified on the ground that if faculty\nmembers had in the past been assigned without regard\nto race such assignments would, as a matter of\nmathematical probability, have yielded this same\nresult.\nOther district courts in framing their decrees\non faculty desegregation have not been specific as\nto the nuOtber of teachers of each race that should\nbe assigned to each school in order to remove the\neffects past discriminatory assignments. These\ncourts have focused upon the mechanics to be followed\nin removi,ng the effect of past discrimination rather\nthan upon the result as such. Thus, in Beckett v.\nSchool Board of the City of Norfolk, Civil Action\nNo. 2214 (E.D. Va., 1966); Gilliam v. School Board\n\n- 45 -\nof the City of Hopewell, Virginia, Civil Action No.\n3554 (E.D. Va. 1966); and Bradley v. School Board\nof City of Richmond, Civil Action No. 3353 (E.D. Va.\n1966), the courts approved consent decrees setting\nforth in detail the considerations that would control\nthe school administrators in filling faculty vacan-\ncies and in transferring already-employed faculty\nmembers in order to facilitate faculty integration.\n12/ The faculty provisions in the  Hopewell case,\nwhich were filed with the district court on April 8,\n1966, read as follows:\nThe School Board of the City of Norfolk\nrecognizes its responsibility to employ,\nassign, promote and discharge teachers\nand other professional personnel of the\nNorfolk City Public School System without\nregard to race or color. It further\nrecognizes its obligation to take all\nreasonable steps to eliminate existing\nracial segregation of faculty that has\nresulted from the past operation of a\ndual school system based upon race or\ncolor:,\nIn order to carry out these responsi-\nbilities, the School Board has adopted\nthe following program:\n1. Teachers and other professional\npersonnel will be employed solely on the\nbasis of qualifications and without\nregard to race or color.\n(Cont. on following page.)\n\nIp yet other cases, the district court, while\nemphasizing the necessity of affirmative steps to\nundo the effects of past racial assignments of\nfaculty and while requiring some tangible results,\n(Cont. from preceding page.)\n11/ \n2. In the recruitment and employment\nof teachers and other professional per-\nsonnel, all applicants and other\nprospective employees will be informed\nthat the City of Norfolk operates a\nracially integrated school system and\nthat the teachers and other professional\npersonnel in the System are subject to\nassignment in the best interest of the\nSystem and without regard to their race\nqr color.\n3. The Superintendent of Schools\n1 \nand his staff will take affirmative steps\nto solicit and encourage teachers\npresently employed in the System to\naccept transfers to schools in which the\nmajority of the faculty members are of\na race different from that of the teacher\nto be transferred. Such transfers will\nbe made by the Superintendent and his\nstaff in all cases in which the teachers\nare qualified and suitable, apart from\nrace or color, for the positions to\nwhich they are to be transferred.\n4.

The result\nis too often an inadequate plan which necessitates\nfurther abrasive involvement of the federal courts in\nlocal school affairs. Instead, we urge the Court to\nmake the legal obligations of local officials as clear\nas possible and to utilize the expertise of HEW in the\nformulation of free choice mechanics. Local responsi-\nbility can then be turned to the far more productive\ntasks of administration and performance.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN DOAR,\nAssistant Attorney General,\nEDWARD L.

The distinctive feature of these cases, \nconsolidated on appeal, is that they also require us to reexamine school desegregation \nstandards in the light of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Guidelines of the United States \nOffice of Education, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). \nWhen the United States Supreme Court in 1954 decided Brown v. Board of Education[1] the \nmembers of the High School Class of 1966 had not entered the first grade. Brown I held \nthat separate schools for Negro children were \"inherently unequal\".[2] Negro children, said \nthe Court, have the \"personal and present\" right to equal educational opportunities with \nwhite children in a racially nondiscriminatory public school system. For all but a handful of \nNegro members of the High School Class of '66 this right has been \"of such stuff as dreams \nare made on\".[3] \n\"The Brown case is misread and misapplied when it is construed simply to confer upon \nNegro pupils the right to be considered for admission to a white school\".[4]The United States \nConstitution, 846*846 as construed in Brown, requires public school systems to integrate \nstudents, faculties, facilities, and activities.[5] If Brown I left any doubt as to the affirmative \nduty of states to furnish a fully integrated education to Negroes as 847*847 a class, Brown \nII resolved that doubt. A state with a dual attendance system, one for whites and one for \nNegroes, must \"effectuate a transition to a [unitary] racially nondiscriminatory school \nsystem.\"[6] The two Brown decisions established equalization of educational opportunities \nas a high priority goal for all of the states and compelled seventeen states, which by law \nhad segregated public schools, to take affirmative action to reorganize their schools into a \nunitary, nonracial system. \nThe only school desegregation plan that meets constitutional standards is one that \nworks. By helping public schools to meet that test, by assisting the courts in their \nindependent evaluation of school desegregation plans, and by accelerating the progress but \nsimplifying the process of desegregation the HEW Guidelines offer new hope to Negro \nschool children long denied their constitutional rights. A national effort, bringing together \nCongress, the executive, and the judiciary may be able to make meaningful the right of \nNegro children to equal educational opportunities. The courts acting alone have failed. \nWe hold, again, in determining whether school desegregation plans meet the standards \nof Brown and other decisions of the Supreme Court,[7] that courts in this circuit should give \n\n\"great weight\" to HEW Guidelines.[8] Such deference is consistent with the exercise of \ntraditional judicial powers and functions. HEW Guidelines are based on decisions of this \nand other courts, are formulated to stay within the scope of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, are \nprepared in detail by experts in education and school administration, and are intended by \nCongress and the executive to be part of a coordinated national program. The Guidelines \npresent the best system available for uniform application, and the best aid to the courts in \nevaluating the validity of a school desegregation plan and the progress made under that \nplan. \nHEW regulations provide that schools applying for financial assistance must comply with \ncertain requirements. However, the requirements for elementary or secondary schools \n\"shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system is subject to a final order of \na court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system * * \n*.\"[9] This regulation causes our decisions to have a twofold impact on school \ndesegregation. Our decisions determine not only (1) the standards 848*848 schools must \ncomply with under Brown but also (2) the standards these schools must comply with to \nqualify for federal financial assistance. Schools automatically qualify for federal aid \nwhenever a final court order desegregating the school has been entered in the litigation and \nthe school authorities agree to comply with the order. Because of the second consequence \nof our decisions and because of our duty to cooperate with Congress and with the executive \nin enforcing Congressional objectives, strong policy considerations support our holding that \nthe standards of court-supervised desegregation should not be lower than the standards of \nHEW-supervised desegregation. The Guidelines, of course, cannot bind the courts; we are \nnot abdicating any judicial responsibilities.[10] But we hold that HEW's standards are \nsubstantially the same as this Court's standards. They are required by the Constitution and, \nas we construe them, are within the scope of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In evaluating \ndesegregation plans, district courts should make few exceptions to the Guidelines and \nshould carefully tailor those so as not to defeat the policies of HEW or the holding of this \nCourt. \nCase by case over the last twelve years, courts have increased their understanding of the \ndesegregation process.[11] Less and less have courts accepted the question-begging \ndistinction between \"desegregation\" and \"integration\" as a sanctuary for school boards \nfleeing from their constitutional duty to establish an integrated, non-racial school \nsystem.[12] With the benefit of this experience, the Court has restudied the School \nSegregation Cases. We have reexamined the nature of the Negro's right to equal \neducational opportunities and the extent of the correlative affirmative duty of the state to \nfurnish equal educational opportunities. We have taken a close look at the background and \nobjectives of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[13] \n* * * \nWe approach decision-making here with humility. Many intelligent men of good will who \nhave dedicated their lives to public education are deeply concerned for fear that a \ndoctrinaire approach to desegregating schools may lower educational standards or even \ndestroy public schools in some areas. These educators and school administrators, \nespecially in communities where total segregation has been the way of life from cradle to \n\ncoffin, may fail to understand all of the legal implications of Brown, but they understand the \ngrim realities of the problems that complicate their task. \nThe Court is aware of the gravity of their problems. (1) Some determined opponents of \ndesegregation would scuttle public education rather than send their children to schools with \nNegro children. These men flee to the suburbs, reinforcing urban neighborhood school \npatterns. (2) Private schools, aided by state 849*849grants, have mushroomed in some \nstates in this circuit.[14] The flight of white children to these new schools and to established \nprivate and parochial schools promotes resegregation. (3) Many white teachers prefer not to \nteach in integrated public schools. They are tempted to seek employment at white private \nschools or to retire. (4) Many Negro children, for various reasons, prefer to finish school \nwhere they started. These are children who will probably have to settle for unskilled \noccupations. (5) The gap between white and Negro scholastic achievements causes all \nsorts of difficulties. There is no consolation in the fact that the gap depends on the socio-\neconomic status of Negroes at least as much as it depends on inferior Negro schools. \nNo court can have a confident solution for a legal problem so closely interwoven with \npolitical, social, and moral threads as the problem of establishing fair, workable standards \nfor undoing de jure school segregation in the South. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nHEW Guidelines are belated but invaluable helps in arriving at a neutral, principled decision \nconsistent with the dimensions of the problem, traditional judicial functions, and the United \nStates Constitution. We grasp the nettle. \nI. \n\"No army is stronger than an idea whose time has come.\"[15] Ten years after Brown, came \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.[16] Congress decided that the time had come for a sweeping \ncivil rights advance, including national legislation to speed up desegregation of public \nschools and to put teeth into enforcement of desegregation.[17] Titles IV and VI together \nconstitute the congressional alternative to court-supervised desegregation. These sections \nof the law mobilize in 850*850 aid of desegregation the United States Office of Education \nand the Nation's purse. \nA. Title IV authorizes the Office of Education to give technical and financial assistance to \nlocal school systems in the process of desegregation.[18] Title VI requires all federal \nagencies administering any grant-in-aid program to see to it that there is no racial \ndiscrimination by any school or other recipient of federal financial aid.[19] School boards \ncannot, however, by giving up federal aid, avoid the policy that produced this limitation on \nfederal aid to schools: Title IV authorizes the Attorney General to sue, in the name of the \nUnited States, to desegregate a public school or school system.[20] More clearly and \neffectively than either of the other two coordinate branches of Government, Congress \nspeaks as the Voice of the Nation. The national policy is plain: formerly de jure segregated \npublic school systems based on dual attendance zones must shift to unitary, nonracial \nsystems — with or without federal funds. \nThe Chief Executive acted promptly to carry into effect the Chief Legislature's mandate. \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill into law July 2, 1964, only a few hours after \nCongress had finally approved it. In the signing ceremony broadcast to the Nation, the \n\nPresident said: \"We believe all men are entitled to the blessings of liberty, yet millions are \nbeing deprived of those blessings — not because of their own failures, but because of the \ncolor of their skins. * * * [It] cannot continue.\"[21] At the request of President Johnson, Vice \nPresident Hubert H. Humphrey submitted a report to the President \"On the Coordination of \nCivil Rights Activities in the Federal Government\" recommending the creation of a Council \non Equal Opportunity. The report concludes that \"the very breadth of the Federal \nGovernment's effort, involving a multiplicity of programs\" necessary to carry out the 1964 \nAct had created a \"problem of coordination.\" The President approved the recommendation \nthat instead of creating a new agency there be a general coordination of effort.[22] Later, the \nPresident noted that the federal departments and agencies had \"adopted uniform and \nconsistent regulations implementing Title VI * * [in] a coordinated program of enforcement.\" \nHe directed the Attorney General to \"coordinate\" the various federal programs in the \nadoption of \"consistent and uniform policies, practices, and procedures 851*851 with respect \nto the enforcement of Title VI * * *.\"[23] \nIn April 1965 Congress for the first time in its history adopted a law providing general federal \naid — a billion dollars a year — for elementary and secondary schools.[24] It is a fair \nassumption that Congress would not have taken this step had Title VI not established the \nprinciple that schools receiving federal assistance must meet uniform national standards for \ndesegregation.[25] \nTo make Title VI effective, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) \nadopted the regulation, \"Non-discrimination in Federally assisted Programs.\"[26] This \nregulation directs the Commissioner of Education to approve applications for financial \nassistance to public schools only if the school or school system agrees to comply with a \ncourt order, if any, outstanding against it, or submits a desegregation plan satisfactory to the \nCommissioner.[27] \nTo make the regulation effective, by assisting the Office of Education in determining \nwhether a school qualifies for federal financial aid and by informing school boards of HEW \nrequirements, HEW formulated certain standards or guidelines. In April 1965, nearly a year \nafter the Act was signed, HEW published its first Guidelines, \"General Statement of Policies \nunder Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Respecting Desegregation of Elementary and \nSecondary Schools.\"[28]These Guidelines fixed the fall of 1967 as the target date for total \ndesegregation of all grades. In March 1966 HEW issued \"Revised Guidelines\" to correct \nmost of the major flaws revealed in the first year of operation under Title VI.[29] \nB. The HEW Guidelines raise the question: To what extent should a court, in determining \nwhether to approve a school desegregation plan, give weight to the HEW Guidelines? We \nadhere to the answer this Court gave in four earlier cases. The HEW Guidelines are \n\"minimum standards\", representing for the most part standards the Supreme Court and this \nCourt established before the Guidelines were promulgated.[30] Again we hold, \"we attach \ngreat weight\" to the Guidelines.Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 \nCir. 1965, 348 F.2d 729 (Singleton I). \"[W]e put these standards to work. * * * [Plans should \nbe] modeled after the Commissioner 852*852 of Education's requirements * * *. [Exceptions \nto the guidelines should be] confined to those rare cases presenting justiciable, not \noperational, questions. * * * The applicable standard is essentially the HEW formulae.\" Price \nv. Denison Independent School District, 5 Cir. 1965, 348 F.2d 1010. \"[W]e consider it to be \n\nin the best interest of all concerned that School Boards meet the minimum standards of the \nOffice of Education * * *. In certain school districts and in certain respects, HEW standards \nmay be too low to meet the requirements established by the Supreme Court and by this \nCourt * * *. [But we also] consider it important to make clear that * * * we do not abdicate our \njudicial responsibility for determining whether a school desegregation plan violates federally \nguaranteed rights.\" Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1966, \n355 F.2d 865 (Singleton II). In Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 5 \nCir. 1966, 364 F.2d 896, the most recent school case before this Court, we \napproved Singleton I and II and Price v. Denison and ordered certain changes in the school \nplan in conformity with the HEW Guidelines. \nCourts in other circuits are in substantial agreement with this Court. In Kemp v. Beasley, 8 \nCir. 1965, 352 F.2d 14, 18-19, the Court said: \"The Court agrees that these [HEW] \nstandards must be heavily relied upon * * *. [T]he courts should endeavor to model their \nstandards after those promulgated by the executive. They are not bound, however, and \nwhen circumstances dictate, the courts may require something more, less or different from \nthe H.E.W. guidelines.\" (Emphasis added.) Concurring, Judge Larson observed: \"However, \nthat `something different' should rarely, if ever, be less than what is contemplated by the \nH.E.W. standards.\" 352 F.2d at 23. Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton, 8 Cir. 1966, \n365 F.2d 770 reaffirms that the Guidelines \"are entitled to serious judicial deference\". \nAlthough the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has not yet considered the effect of the \nHEW standards, district courts in that circuit have relied on the guidelines. See Kier v. \nCounty School Board of Augusta County, W.D.Va.1966, 249 F.Supp. 239; Wright v. County \nSchool Board of Greenville County, E.D. Va.1966, 252 F.Supp. 378; Miller v. Clarendon \nCounty School District No. 2, D.S.C., 253 F.Supp. 552, April 21, 1966. In Miller, one of the \nmost recent of these cases, the court said: \nThe orderly progress of desegregation is best served if school sytems desegregating under \ncourt order are required to meet the minimum standards promulgated for systems that \ndesegregate voluntarily. Without directing absolute adherence to the \"Revised Statement\" \nguidelines at this juncture, this court will welcome their inclusion in any new, amended, or \nsubstitute plan which may be adopted and submitted. \nIn this circuit, the school problem arises from state action. This Court has not had to deal \nwith nonracially motivated de facto segregation, that is, racial imbalance resulting \nfortuitously in a school system based on a single neighborhood school serving all white and \nNegro children in a certain attendance area or neighborhood. For this circuit, the HEW \nGuidelines offer, for the first time, the prospect that the transition from a de jure segregated \ndual system to a unitary integrated system may be carried out effectively, promptly, and in \nan orderly manner. See Appendix B, Rate of Change and Status of Desegregation. \nII. \nWe read Title VI as a congressional mandate for change — change in pace and method of \nenforcing desegregation. The 1964 Act does not disavow court-supervised desegregation. \nOn the contrary, Congress recognized that to the courts belongs the last word in any \ncase 853*853 or controversy.[31] But Congress was dissatisfied with the slow progress \n\ninherent in the judicial adversary process.[32]Congress therefore fashioned a new method of \nenforcement to be administered not on a case by case basis as in the courts but generally, \nby federal agencies operating on a national scale and having a special competence in their \nrespective fields. Congress looked to these agencies to shoulder the additional enforcement \nburdens resulting from the shift to high gear in school desegregation. \nA. Congress was well aware that it was time for a change. In the decade \nfollowing Brown, court-supervised desegregation made qualitative progress: Responsible \nSouthern leaders accepted desegregation as a settled constitutional \nprinciple.[33]Quantitively, the results were meagre. The statistics speak eloquently. See \nAppendix B, Rate of Change and Status of Desegregation. In 1965 the public school \ndistricts in the consolidated cases now before this Court had a school population of 155,782 \nschool children, 59,361 of whom were Negro. Yet under the existing court-approved \ndesegregation plans, only 110 Negro children in these districts, .019 per cent of the school \npopulation, attend formerly \"white\" schools.[34]In 1965 there was no faculty desegregation in \nany of these school districts; indeed, none of the 30,500 Negro teachers in Alabama, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi served with any of 854*854 the 65,400 white teachers in those \nstates.[35] In the 1963-64 school year, the eleven states of the Confederacy had 1.17 per \ncent of their Negro students in schools with white students.[36] In 1964-65, undoubtedly \nbecause of the effect of the 1964 Act, the percentage doubled, reaching 2.25. For the 1965-\n66 school year, this time because of HEW Guidelines, the percentage reached 6.01 per \ncent. In 1965-66 the entire region encompassing the Southern and border states had 10.9 \nper cent of their Negro children in school with white children; 1,555 biracial school districts \nout of 3,031 in the Southern and border states were still fully segregated; 3,101,043 Negro \nchildren in the region attended all-Negro schools. Despite the impetus of the 1964 Act, the \nstates of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, still had less than one per cent of their Negro \nenrollment, attending schools with white students.[37] \nThe dead hand of the old past and the closed fist of the recent past account for some of the \nslow progress. There are other reasons — as obvious to Congress as to courts. (1) Local \nloyalties compelled school officials and elected officials to make a public record of their \nunwillingness to act. But even school authorities willing to act have moved slowly because \nof uncertainty as to the scope of their duty to act affirmatively. This is attributable to (a) a \nmisplaced reliance on the Briggs dictum that the Constitution \"does not require \nintegration\",[38] (b) a misunderstanding of the Brown II mandate, desegregate with \"all \ndeliberate speed\",[39] and (c) a mistaken notion that transfers under the Pupil Placement \nLaws satisfy desegregation requirements.[40] (2) Case by case development 855*855 of the \nlaw is a poor sort of medium for reasonably prompt and uniform desegregation. There are \nnatural limits to effective legal action. Courts cannot give advisory opinions, and the \ndisciplined exercise of the judicial function properly makes courts reluctant to move forward \nin an area of the law bordering the periphery of the judicial domain. (3) The contempt power \nis ill-suited to serve as the chief means of enforcing desegregation. Judges naturally shrink \nfrom using it against citizens willing to accept the thankless, painful responsibility of serving \non a school board.[41] (4) School desegregation plans are often woefully inadequate; they \nrarely provide necessary detailed instructions and specific answers to administrative \nproblems.[42] And most judges do not have sufficient competence — they are not educators \nor school administrators — to know the right questions, must less the right answers. (5) But \none reason more than any other has held back desegregation of public schools on a large \n\nscale. This has been the lack, until 1964, of effective congressional statutory recognition of \nschool desegregation as the law of the land.[43] \n\"Considerable progress has been made * * *. Nevertheless, in the last 856*856 decade it has \nbecome increasingly clear that progress has been too slow and that national legislation is \nrequired to meet a national need which becomes ever more obvious.\"[44] Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, therefore, was not only appropriate and proper legislation under the \nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments; it was necessary to rescue school desegregation \nfrom the bog in which it had been trapped for ten years.[45] \nThe Civil Rights Commission, doubtless better able than any other authority to understand \nthe significance of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, had this to say about Title VI: \n\"This statute heralded a new era in school desegregation * * *. Most significantly * * * \nFederal power was to be brought to bear in a manner which promised speedier and more \nsubstantial desegregation than had been achieved through the voluntary efforts of school \nboards and district-by-district litigation. * * * During fiscal year 1964, $176,546,992 was \ndistributed to State and local school agencies in the 17 Southern and border States. The \npassage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 added an additional \nappropriation of $589,946,135 for allocation to the 17 Southern and border States for fiscal \nyear 1966. With funds of such magnitude at stake, most school systems would be placed at \na serious disadvantage by termination of Federal assistance.\"[46] \nB. The congressional mandate, as embodied in the Act and as carried out in the HEW \nGuidelines, does not conflict with the proper exercise of the judicial function or with the \ndoctrine of separation of powers. It does however profoundly affect constructive use of the \njudicial function within the lawful scope of sound judicial discretion. When Congress \ndeclares national policy, the duty the two other coordinate branches owe to the Nation \nrequires that, within the law, the judiciary and the executive respect and carry out that \npolicy. Here the Chief Executive acted promptly to bring about uniform standards for \ndesegregation. The judicial branch too should cooperate with Congress and the executive in \nmaking administrative agencies effective instruments for supervising and enforcing \ndesegregation of public schools. Justice Harlan F. Stone expressed this well: \n\"Legislatures create administrative agencies with the desire and expectation that they will \nperform efficiently the tasks committed to them. That, at least, is one of the contemplated \nsocial advantages to be weighed in resolving doubtful construction. Its aim is so obvious as \nto make unavoidable the conclusion that the function which courts are called upon to \nperform, in carrying into operation such administrative 857*857 schemes, is constructive, not \ndestructive, to make administrative agencies, whenever reasonably possible, effective \ninstruments for law enforcement, and not to destroy them.\"[47] \nIn an analogous situation involving enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the \nSupreme Court has said, \"Good administration of the Act and good judicial administration \nalike require that the standards of public enforcement and those for determining private \nrights shall be at variance only where justified by very good reasons.\" Skidmore v. Swift & \nCo., 1944, 323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124. In an appeal from the district court's \ndenial of an injunction to enforce labor standards under the Act this Court has pointed out: \n\n\"* * * this proceeding is only superficially related to a suit in equity for an injunction to protect \ninterests jeopardized in a private controversy. The public interest is jeopardized here. The \ninjunctive processes are a means of effecting general compliance with national policy as \nexpressed by Congress, a public policy judges too must carry out — actuated by the spirit \nof the law and not begrudgingly as if it were a newly imposed fiat of a presidium. * * * \nImplicit in the defendants' non-compliance, as we read the briefs and the record, is a certain \nunderlying, not unnatural, Actonian distaste for national legislation affecting local activities. \nBut the Fair Labor Standards Law has been on the books for twenty-three years. The Act \nestablishes a policy for all of the country, and for the courts as well as for the agency \nrequired to administer the law. Mitchell v. Pidcock, 5 Cir. 1962, 299 F.2d 281, 287, 288. \nC. We must therefore cooperate with Congress and the Executive in enforcing Title VI. The \nproblem is: Are the HEW Guidelines within the scope of the congressional and executive \npolicies embodied in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We hold that they are. \nThe Guidelines do not purport to be a rule or regulation or order. They constitute a \nstatement of policy under section 80.4(c) of the HEW Regulations issued after the President \napproved the regulations December 3, 1964. HEW is under no statutory compulsion to \nissue such statements. It is, however, of manifest advantage to school boards throughout \nthe country and to the general public to know the criteria the Commissioner uses in \ndetermining whether a school meets the requirements for eligibility to receive financial \nassistance. \nThe Guidelines have the vices of all administrative policies established unilaterally without a \nhearing. Because of these vices the courts, as the school boards point out, have set limits \non administrative regulations, rulings, policies, and practices: an agency construction of a \nstatute cannot make the law; it must conform to the law and be reasonable. To some extent \nthe administrative weight of the declarations depends on the place of such declarations in \nthe hierarchy of agency pronouncements extending from regulations down to \ngeneral 858*858 counsel memoranda and inter-office decisions. See Manhattan General \nElectric Company v. Commissioner, 1936, 297 U.S. 129, 56 S.Ct. 397, 80 L.Ed. 528; United \nStates v. Bennett, 5 Cir. 1951, 186 F.2d 407; United States v. Mississippi Chemical \nCorporation, 5 Cir., 1964, 326 F.2d 569; Chattanooga Auto Club v. Commissioner of \nInternal Revenue, 6 Cir. 1950, 182 F.2d 551. \nThese and similar decisions are not inconsistent with the courts' giving great weight to the \nHEW's policy statements on enforcement of Title VI. In Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. \n134, 65 S.Ct. 161, an action was commenced in a federal district court by employees of \nSwift & Co. to recover wages at the overtime rates prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards \nAct (52 Stat.1060, et seq.) for certain services which they had performed. At issue was \nwhether these services constituted \"employment\" within the meaning of section 7(a) of that \nact. The district court and this Court, on appeal, decided this issue against the plaintiffs. The \nSupreme Court reversed. After acknowledging (323 U.S. at 137, 65 S.Ct. at 163) that the \nstatute had granted no rule-making power to the Wage and Hour Administrator with respect \nto the issue at hand (\"[i]nstead, it put this responsibility on the courts\"), the Court referred to \nan \"Interpretative Bulletin\" issued by the Administrator containing his interpretation of the \nstatutory phrase in question. The Supreme Court said: \n\n\"We consider that the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this \nAct, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of \nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for \nguidance. The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the \nthoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with \nearlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if \nlacking power to control.\"[48] \nThe Supreme Court found that the lower courts had misunderstood their function vis-a-vis \nthe Interpretative Bulletin and remanded the case. See also, United States v. American \nTrucking Association, 1940, 310 U.S. 534, 543, 549, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 134; Goldberg \nv. Sorvas, 1 Cir. 1961, 294 F.2d 841, 847. \nIt is evident to anyone that the Guidelines were carefully formulated by educational \nauthorities anxious to be faithful to the objectives of the 1964 Act. To the members of this \nCourt, who for years have gone to bed and waked up with school segregation problems on \ntheir minds, it is evident that the HEW standards are strikingly similar to the standards the \nSupreme Court and this Court have established. The Guidelines, therefore, are not run-of-\nthe-mine agency pronouncements low in the hierarchy of administrative declarations. They \nare not regulations requiring the approval of the President. They may be described as a \nrestatement of the judicial standards 859*859 applicable to disestablishing de jure \nsegregation in the public schools. \nCourts therefore should cooperate with the congressional-executive policy in favor of \ndesegregation and against aiding segregated schools. \nD. Because our approval of a plan establishes eligibility for federal aid, our standards \nshould not be lower than those of HEW. Unless judicial standards are substantially in \naccord with the Guidelines, school boards previously resistent to desegregation will resort to \nthe courts to avoid complying with the minimum standards HEW promulgates for schools \nthat desegregate voluntarily. As we said in Singleton I: \n\"If in some district courts judicial guides for approval of a school desegregation plan are \nmore acceptable to the community or substantially less burdensome than H.E.W. guides, \nschool boards may turn to the federal courts as a means of circumventing the H.E.W. \nrequirements for financial aid. Instead of a uniform policy relatively easy to administer, both \nthe courts and the Office of Education would have to struggle with individual school systems \non ad hoc basis. If judicial standards are lower than H.E.W. standards, recalcitrant school \nboards in effect will receive a premium for recalcitrance; the more the intransigence, the \nbigger the bonus.\" 348 F.2d at 731. \nIn Kemp v. Beasley, 8 Cir. 1965, 352 F.2d 14, the Court concluded: \n\"[HEW] standards must be heavily relied upon. * * * Therefore, to the end of promoting a \ndegree of uniformity and discouraging reluctant school boards from reaping a benefit from \ntheir reluctance the courts should endeavor to model their standards after those \npromulgated by the executive.\" 352 F.2d at 18, 19. \n\nConcurring, Judge Larson, speaking from his experience as a district judge, pointed out that \nschool boards which do not act voluntarily retard the desegregation process to the \ndisadvantage of the individual's constitutional rights. \"Judicial criteria\", therefore, \"should \nprobably be more stringent\" than HEW Guidelines: \n\"A school board which fails to act voluntarily forces Negro students to solicit aid from the \ncourts. This not only shifts the burden of initiating desegregation, but inevitably means delay \nin taking the first step. As Judge Gibson observes, we are not here concerned with \nregulating the flow of Federal funds. Our task is to safeguard basic constitutional rights. \nThus, our standards should be directed toward full, complete, and final realization of those \nrights.\" 352 F.2d at 23. \nThe announcement in HEW regulations that the Commissioner would accept a final school \ndesegregation order as proof of the school's eligibility for federal aid prompted a number of \nschools to seek refuge in the federal courts. Many of these had not moved an inch toward \ndesegregation.[49] In Louisiana alone twenty school boards obtained quick decrees providing \nfor desegregation according to plans greatly at variance with the Guidelines.[50] \nWe shall not permit the courts to be used to destroy or dilute the effectiveness of the \ncongressional policy expressed 860*860 in Title VI. There is no bonus for foot-dragging. \nE. The experience this Court has had in the last ten years argues strongly for uniform \nstandards in court-supervised desegregation. \nThe first school case to reach this Court after Brown v. Board of Education was Brown v. \nRippy, 5 Cir. 1956, 233 F.2d 796. Since then we have reviewed 41 other school cases, \nmany more than once.[51] The district courts in this circuit have considered 128 school cases \nin the same period. Reviewing these cases imposes a taxing, time-consuming burden on \nthe courts not reflected in statistics. An analysis of the cases shows a wide lack of \nuniformity in areas where there is no good reason for variations in the schedule and manner \nof desegregation.[52] In some cases there has been a substantial time-lag between this \nCourt's opinions and their application by the district courts.[53] In certain cases — cases we \nconsider unnecessary to cite — there has even been a manifest variance between this \nCourt's decision and a later district court decision. A number of district courts still mistakenly \nassume that transfers under Pupil Placement Laws superimposed on unconstitutional initial \nassignment satisfy the requirements 861*861 of a desegregation plan. The lack of clear and \nuniform standards to govern school boards has tended to put a premium on delaying \nactions. In sum, the lack of uniform standards has retarded the development of local \nresponsibility for the administration of schools without regard to race or color. What Cicero \nsaid of an earlier Athens and an earlier Rome is equally applicable today: In Georgia, for \nexample, there should not be one law for Athens and another law for Rome. \nBefore HEW published its Guidelines, this Court had already established guidelines for \nschool desegregation: to encourage uniformity at the district court level and to conserve \njudicial effort at both the district court and appellate levels. We did so by making detailed \nsuggestions to the district courts. Lockett v. Board of Education of Muscogee County, 5 Cir. \n1964, 342 F.2d 225; Bivins v. Board of Education for Bibb County, 5 Cir. 1965, 342 F.2d \n229; Armstrong v. Board of Education of Birmingham, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 47; Davis v. \n\nBoard of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 53; Stell v. \nSavannah-Chatham County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d 55; Gaines v. \nDougherty County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1964, 334 F.2d 983. In other areas of the law \ninvolving recurrent problems of regional or national interest, this Court has also found \nguidelines advantageous. In United States v. Ward, 5 Cir. 1965, 349 F.2d 795, and United \nStates v. Palmer, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 951, suits to enjoin registrars of voters from \ndiscriminating against Negroes, we attached identical proposed decrees for the guidance of \ndistrict courts.[54] See also Scott v. Walker, 5 Cir. 1966, 358 F.2d 561, one of a series of \ncases on the exclusion of Negroes from juries. \nF. We summarize the Court's policy as one of encouraging the maximum legally permissible \ncorrelation between judicial standards for school desegregation and HEW Guidelines. This \npolicy may be applied without federal courts' abdicating their proper judicial function. The \npolicy complies with the Supreme Court's increasing emphasis on more speed and less \ndeliberation in school desegregation.[55] It is consistent with the judiciary's duty to the Nation \nto cooperate with the two other coordinate branches of government in carrying out the \nnational policy expressed in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nIII. \nThe defendants contend that the Guidelines require integration, not just desegregation; that \nschool boards have no affirmative duty to integrate. They say that in this respect the \nGuidelines are contrary to the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to constitutional \nintent expressed in the Act. This argument rests on nothing that the United 862*862 States \nSupreme Court held or said in Brown or in any other case. It rests on two glosses \non Brown: the opinions in Briggs v. Elliott, E.D.S.C. 1955, 132 F. Supp. 776 and Bell v. \nSchool City of Gary, N.D.Ind.1963, 213 F.Supp. 819, aff'd, 7 Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d \n209. Briggs, decided only six weeks after Brown II, is one of the earliest cases in this field of \nlaw. The portion of the opinion most quoted is pure dictum. Briggs did not paraphrase the \nlaw as the Supreme Court stated it in Brown or as the law must be stated today in the light \nof Aaron v. Cooper, Rogers v. Paul and Bradley v. School Board. These and other \ndecisions compel states in this circuit to take affirmative action to reorganize their school \nsystems by integrating the students, faculties, facilities, and activities. As for Bell, it is \ninapplicable to cases in this circuit, none of which involve de facto segregated schools. \nAlthough the legislative history of the statute shows that the floor managers for the Act and \nother members of the Senate and House cited and quoted these two opinions they did so \nwithin the context of the problem of de facto segregration. A study of the Guidelines shows \nthat the HEW standards are within the rationale of Brown and the congressional objectives \nof the Act. \nA. Briggs, an action to desegregate the public schools in Clarendon County, South Carolina, \nwas one of the school cases consolidated with Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, \nKansas. On remand, a distinguished court (Parker and Dobie, Circuit Judges, and \nTimmerman, District Judge) felt that it was important to \"point out exactly what the Supreme \nCourt has decided and what it has not decided.\" The Court said: \n\"It has not decided that the federal courts are to take over or regulate the public schools of \nthe states. It has not decided that the states must mix persons of different races in the \n\nschools or must require them to attend schools or must deprive them of the right of \nchoosing the schools they attend. What it has decided, and all that it has decided, is that a \nstate may not deny to any person on account of race the right to attend any school that it \nmaintains. * * * The Constitution, in other words, does not require integration. It merely \nforbids [segregation].\" 132 F.Supp. at 777. \nTen years later Clarendon County schools were still totally segregated.[56] \nThis Court and other courts, gratuitously for the most part, have often paraphrased or \nquoted with approval the Briggs dictum.[57] It is not surprising, 863*863 therefore, \nthat Briggs prompted Pupil Placement Laws, the most effective technique for perpetuating \nschool segregation. And it is not surprising that school officials — the Briggs dictum dinned \ninto their ears for a decade — have not now faced up to faculty integration. However, as this \nCourt's experience in handling school cases increased, the Court became aware of the \nfrustrating effects of Briggs. In Singleton I we referred to the dictum as \"inconsistent with \nBrown [II] and the later development of decisional and statutory law in the area of civil \nrights.\" 348 F.2d at 730 n. 5. In Singleton II we called it an \"oversimplified\" construction \nof Brown I. We added: \"The Constitution forbids unconstitutional state action in the form of \nsegregated facilities, including segregated public schools. School authorities, therefore, are \nunder the constitutional compulsion of furnishing a single, integrated school system.\" 355 \nF.2d at 869. Other federal courts have disapproved of the Briggs dictum.[58] \n864*864 The Briggs dictum may be explained as a facet of the Fourth Circuit's now \nabandoned view that Fourteenth Amendment rights are exclusively individual rights and in \nschool cases are to be asserted individually after each plaintiff has exhausted state \nadministrative remedies.[59] The Court disallowed class suits because Negro students who \nhad not asked for transfers to white schools had not individually exhausted their remedies \nand were therefore not similarly situated with the plaintiffs. Thus in Carson v. Warlick, 4 Cir. \n1956, 238 F.2d 724, Judge John Parker, for the Court, stated: \n\"There is no question as to the right of these [Negro] school children * * *. They [are to be] \nadmitted, however, as individuals, not as a class or group; and it is as individuals that their \nrights under the Constitution are asserted. * * * [The] school board must pass upon \nindividual applications made individually to the board. * *\" 238 F.2d at 729. \nIn Covington v. Edwards, 4 Cir. 1959, 264 F.2d 780, 783, the court commented that \"the \nCounty board has taken no steps to put an end to the planned segregation\", but still held for \nthe board for failure of the plaintiffs to exhaust their remedies and for filing the suit as a \nclass action. As late as 1961, a district court observed: \n\"It can fairly be said that what the children and their parents are still seeking is only a \ndesegregation of the Caswell County School System rather than a protection of their own \nrights. . . .\" Jeffers v. Whitley, M.D. N.C. Dec. 29, 1961, 7 Race Rel.L.Rep. 22, 24. \nThe Fourth Circuit moved away from this view, holding that administrative remedies need \nnot be exhausted where the School Board's past discriminatory practices made clear that \nexhaustion would be futile, or where there was no time to seek redress through proper \nadministrative channels. Jeffers v. Whitley, 4 Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 621; Green v. School \n\nBoard of the City of Roanoke, 4 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 119. Green is particularly significant in \nits approval of a class suit to abolish discriminatory practices: \n\"Even if limited to its narrowest interpretation, it holds that after one Negro child exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, he may bring suit on behalf of all children segregated in the \nschool system. The other children do not have to follow individually the labyrinth of \nadministrative steps in the pupil placement act.\" Emerson, Haber & Dorsen 1668 (2d \ned.1967). \n\"[It] would be almost a cruel joke to say that administrative remedies must be exhausted \nwhen it is known that such exhaustion of remedies will not terminate the pattern of a racial \nassignment.\" Jackson v. School Board of City of Lynchburg, W.D.Va.1962, 201 F.Supp. \n620. McNeese v. Board of Education for School District 187, 1963, 373 U.S. 668, 83 S.Ct. \n1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622, put beyond debate the need to exhaust remedies and the right of \nNegro students to file a class action. See also Armstrong v. Board of Education of the City \nof Birmingham, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 333, cert-denied sub. nom. Gibson v. Harris, 376 U.S. \n908, 84 S.Ct. 661, 11 L.Ed.2d 606 (1964). \nIn the sense that an individual pupil's right under the equal protection clause is a \"personal \nand present\" right not to be discriminated against by being segregated,[60] the dictum is a \ncliché. The Fourteenth Amendment provides, \"nor shall any State * * * deny to \nany 865*865 person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\". The dictum would \nalso be defensible, if the Briggs court had used the term \"integration\" to mean an absolute \ncommand at all costs that each and every Negro child attend a racially balanced \nschool.[61] But what is wrong about the dictum is more important than what is right about it. \nWhat is wrong about Briggs is that it drains out of Brown that decision's significance as a \nclass action to secure equal educational opportunities for Negroes by compelling the states \nto reorganize their public school systems.[62] All four of the original School \nSegregation cases were 866*866 class actions and described as such in the opinions. 347 \nU.S. at 455, 74 S.Ct. 686. \nWe do not minimize the importance of the Fourteenth Amendment rights of an individual, \nbut there was more at issue in Brown than the controversy between certain schools and \ncertain children. Briggs overlooks the fact that Negroes collectively are harmed when the \nstate, by law or custom, operates segregated schools or a school system with uncorrected \neffects of segregation. \nDenial of access to the dominant culture, lack of opportunity in any meaningful way to \nparticipate in political and other public activities, the stigma of apartheid condemned in the \nThirteenth Amendment are concomitants of the dual educational system. The unmalleable \nfact transcending in importance the harm to individual Negro children is that the separate \nschool system was an integral element in the Southern State's general program to restrict \nNegroes as a class from participation in the life of the community, the affairs of the State, \nand the mainstream of American life: Negroes must keep their place.[63] \n\"[S]egregation is a group phenomenon. Although the effects of discrimination are felt by \neach member of the group, any discriminatory practice is directed against the group as a \nunit and against individuals only as their connection with the group involves the antigroup \n\nsanction. * * * [As] a group-wrong * * * the mode of redress must be group-wide to be \nadequate.\"[64] Adequate redress therefore calls for much more than allowing a few Negro \nchildren to attend formerly white schools; it calls for liquidation of the state's system of de \njure school segregation and the organized undoing of the effects of past segregation. \n\"Beyond [a child's] personal right [under the Fourteenth Amendment] however, or perhaps \nas an aspect of it, the lower federal courts seem to be recognizing a right in Negro school \nchildren, enforceable at least by a class action, to have the school system administered free \nof an enforced policy of segregation irrespective of whether any colored pupil has been \ndenied admission to any particular school on the ground of his race.\"[65] \nIt is undoubtedly true that the intangible inadequacies of a segregated education harm the \nindividual, but the Supreme Court treated these inadequacies as inherent attributes which \nprevail universally.[66] For example, the Court said: \n867*867 [Education] is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principle \ninstrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional \ntraining, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is \ndoubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the \nopportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to \nprovide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms 347 U.S. at 493, 74 \nS. Ct. at 691. (Emphasis added.) \nAgain, in a critical passage: \nTo separate [children] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their \nrace generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their \nhearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. 347 U.S. at 494, 74 S.Ct. at 691. \nWith this predicate it is not surprising that Brown II, a year after Brown I was decided, going \nbeyond recognition of the \"personal\" right in the individual plaintiffs, fashioned a remedy \nappropriate for the class. The Court imposed on the states the duty of furnishing an \nintegrated school system, that is, the duty of \"effectuat[ing] a transition to a racially \nnondiscriminatory school system.\"[67] (Emphasis added.) In addition, Brown II subordinated \nthe \"present\" right in the individual plaintiffs to the right of Negroes as a class to a unitary, \nnonracial system — some time in the future.[68] \nThe central vice in a formerly de jure segregated public school system is apartheid by dual \nzoning: in the past by law, the use of one set of attendance zones for white children and \nanother for Negro children, and the compulsory initial assignment of a Negro to the Negro \nschool in his zone. Dual zoning persists in the continuing operation of Negro schools \nidentified as Negro, historically and because the faculty and students are Negroes. \nAcceptance of an individual's application for transfer, therefore, may satisfy that particular \nindividual; it will not satisfy the class. The class is all Negro children in a school district \nattending, by definition, inherently unequal 868*868 schools and wearing the badge of \nslavery separation displays. Relief to the class requires school boards to desegregate the \nschool from which a transferee comes as well as the school to which he goes. It requires \nconversion of the dual zones into a single system. Faculties, facilities, and activities as well \nas student bodies must be integrated. No matter what view is taken of the rationale \n\nin Brown I, Brown II envisaged the remedy following the wrong, the state's correcting its \ndiscrimination against Negroes as a class, through separate schools, by initiating and \noperating a unitary integrated school system. The gradual transition the Supreme Court \nauthorized was to allow the states time to solve the administrative problems inherent in that \nchange-over. No delay would have been necessary if the right at issue in Brown had been \nonly the right of individual Negro plaintiffs to admission to a white school. Moreover, the \ndelay of one year in deciding Brown II and the gradual remedy Brown II fashioned can be \njustified only on the ground that the \"personal and present\" right of the individual plaintiffs \nmust yield to the overriding right of Negroes as a class to a completely integrated public \neducation.[68a] \nAlthough psychological harm and lack of educational opportunities to Negroes may exist \nwhether caused by de facto or de jure segregation, a state policy of apartheid aggravates \nthe harm. Thus, Chief Justice Warren quoted with approval the finding of the district court in \nthe Kansas case: \"The impact [of the detrimental effect of segregation upon Negro children] \nis greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is \nusually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority \naffects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has \na tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of Negro children and to \ndeprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school \nsystem.\" (Emphasis added.) Brown I, 347 U.S. at 494, 74 S.Ct. at 691. The State, therefore, \nshould be under a duty to take whatever corrective action is necessary to undo the harm it \ncreated and fostered.[69] \"State authorities were thus duty bound to devote every effort \ntoward initiating desegregation and bringing about the elimination of racial discrimination in \nthe public school system.\" (Emphasis added.) Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. at 7, 78 S.Ct. at \n1404. Some may doubt whether tolerance of de facto segregation is an unsubtle form of \nstate action. There can be no doubt as to the nature and effect of segregation that came \ninto being and persists because of state action as part of the longstanding pattern to narrow \nthe access 869*869 of Negroes to political power and to the life of the community. \nIn a school system the persons capable of giving class relief are of course its \nadministrators. It is they who are under the affirmative duty to take corrective action toward \nthe goal of one integrated system. As Judges Sobeloff and Bell said in their concurring \nopinion in Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 4 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 310, 322: \n* * * the initiative in achieving desegregation of the public schools must come from the \nschool authorities. * * * Affirmative action means more than telling those who have long \nbeen deprived of freedom of educational opportunity. `You now have a choice.' * * * It is \nnow 1965 and high time for the court to insist that good faith compliance requires \nadministrators of schools to proceed actively with their nontransferable duty to undo the \nsegregation which both by action and inaction has been persistently perpetuated. \n(Emphasis added.) \nIn Northcross v. Board of Education of the City of Memphis, 6 Cir. 1962, 302 F.2d 818, the \ndefendants asserted, as the defendants assert here, that continued segregation is \n\"voluntary on the part of Negro pupils and parents because they do not avail themselves of \nthe transfer provisions.\" The Court held: \"The Pupil Assignment Law * * * will not serve as a \nplan to convert a biracial system into a nonracial one * * * Negro children cannot be required \n\nto apply for that to which they are entitled as a matter of right. * * * The burden rests with the \nschool authorities to initiate desegregation * * * [The Board should submit] some realistic \nplan for the organization of their schools on a nonracial basis\". (Emphasis added.) In Dowell \nv. School Board of Oklahoma City Public Schools, W.D.Okla.1965, 244 F.Supp. 971, 976, \n978-979, aff'd, 10 Cir. Jan. 23, 1967, 375 F.2d 158, the School Board in Oklahoma City had \n\"superimposed\" a geographic zone plan on \"already existing residential segregation \ninitiated by law.\" The court held: A school board must \"adopt policies that would increase \nthe percentage of pupils who are obtaining a desegregated education. * * * [The] failure to \nadopt an affirmative policy is itself a policy, adherence to which, at least in this case, has \nslowed up * * * the desegregation process. * * * [W]here the cessation of assignment and \ntransfer policies based solely on race is insufficient to bring about more than token change \nin the segregated system, the Board must devise affirmative action reasonably purposed to \neffectuate the desegregation goal. This conclusion makes no new law.\" \nThe position we take in these consolidated cases is that the only adequate redress for a \npreviously overt system-wide policy of segregation directed against Negroes as a collective \nentity is a system-wide policy of integration. In Singleton I the Court touched on the state's \nduty to integrate: \n\"In retrospect, the second Brown opinion clearly imposes on public school authorities the \nduty to provide an integrated school system. Judge Parker's well-known dictum * * * should \nbe laid to rest. It is inconsistent with Brown and the later development of decisional and \nstatutory law in the area of civil rights.\" 348 F.2d at 730 n. 5. \nThree years before Singleton I this Court analyzed the problem in Potts v. Flax, 5 Cir. 1963, \n313 F.2d 284. In that case the Court rejected a school board's contention that a suit brought \nby two Negro parents was not a class action even though the record contained testimony \nthat one parent was bringing the action only for his own children and not for other Negro \nchildren. The Board contended that a court order was not needed because it was willing to \nadmit any Negro child to a white school on demand of any Negro child. Judge Brown, \nspeaking for the Court, said: \n\"Properly construed the purpose of the suit was not to achieve specific 870*870 assignment \nof specific children to any specific grade or school. The peculiar rights of specific individuals \nwere not in controversy. It was directed at the system-wide policy of racial segregation. It \nsought obliteration of that policy of system-wide racial discrimination. * * *\"[70] \nEven before Potts v. Flax, in Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 5 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d \n492, 499, the Court said: \n\"In this aspect of [initial] pupil assignment [to segregated schools] the facts present a clear \ncase where there is not only deprivation of the rights of the individuals directly concerned \nbut deprivation of the rights of Negro school children as a class. As a class, and irrespective \nof any individual's right to be admitted on a non-racial basis to a particular school, Negro \nchildren in the public schools have a constitutional right to have the public school system \nadministered free from an administrative policy of segregation.\"[71] \n\nSee also Ross v. Dyer, 5 Cir. 1963, 312 F.2d 191, 194-95; Augustus v. Board of Public \nInstruction of Escambia County, 5 Cir. 1963, 306 F.2d 862, 869; Holland v. Board of Public \nInstruction of Palm Beach County, 5 Cir. 1958, 258 F.2d 730; Orleans Parish School Board \nv. Bush, 5 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 156. \nBrown was an inevitable, predictable extension of Sweatt v. Painter, 1950, 339 U.S. 629, 70 \nS.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 1114, and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 1950, 339 U.S. 637, \n70 S.Ct. 851, 94 L.Ed. 1149.[72] Those cases involved separate but equal or identical \ngraduate facilities. Factors \"incapable of objective measurement\" but crucial to a good \ngraduate education were not available to segregated Negroes. These were the intangible \nfactors that prevented the Negro graduate students from having normal contacts and \nassociation 871*871 with white students. Apartheid made the two groups unequal. In Brown \nI these same intangibles were found \"[to] apply with added force to children in grade and \nhigh schools\"; educational opportunity in public schools must be made available to all on \nequal terms. \nThe Brown I finding that segregated schooling causes psychological harm and denies equal \neducational opportunities should not be construed as the sole basis for the decision.[73] So \nconstrued, the way would be open for proponents of the status quo to attempt to show, on \nthe facts, that integration may be harmful or the greater of two evils. Indeed that narrow \nview of Brown I has led several district courts into error.[74] We think that the judgment \"must \nhave rested on the view that racial segregation is, in principle, a denial of equality to the \nminority against whom it is directed.\"[75] The relief Brown II requires rests on recognition of \nthe principle that state-imposed separation by race is an invidious classification and for that \nreason alone is unconstitutional.[76] Classifications based upon race are especially suspect, \nsince they are \"odius to a free people\".[77] In short, compulsory 872*872separation, apartheid, \nis per se discriminatory against Negroes. \nA number of post-Brown per curiam decisions not involving education make it clear that the \nbroad dimensions of the rationale are not circumscribed by the necessity of \nshowing harmful inequality to the individual. In these cases Negroes were separated from \nwhites but were afforded equal or identical facilities. Relying on Brown, the Court ordered \nintegration of the facility or activity.[78] See also Anderson v. Martin, 1964, 375 U.S. 399, \n402, 84 S.Ct. 454, 11 L.Ed.2d 430, 433, holding that compulsory designation of a \ncandidate's race on the ballot is unlawful. The designation placed \"the power of the State \nbehind a racial classification that induces racial prejudice at the polls.\" \nBolling v. Sharpe, 1954, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884, provides further \nevidence of the breadth of the right recognized in Brown. There, because the case \nconcerned the District of Columbia, the Court had to rely on the due process clause of the \nFifth Amendment instead of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nGoing beyond any question of psychological harm or of the denial of equal educational \nopportunities to the individual, the Court concluded that racial classifications in public \neducation are so unreasonable and arbitrary as to violate due process:[79] \n\"Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue, \nand it cannot be restricted except for a proper governmental objective. Segregation in public \neducation is not reasonably related to any proper governmental objective, and thus it \n\nimposes on Negro children * * * a burden that constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of their \nliberty.\" 347 U.S. at 498, 74 S.Ct. at 694. (Emphasis added.) \nAs in the jury exclusion cases, when the classification is not \"reasonably related to any \nproper governmental objective\" equal protection and due process merge. \nIf Brown has only the narrow meaning Briggs gives it the system of statesanctioned \nsegregated schools will continue indefinitely with only a little token desegregation. White \nschool boards, almost universal in this circuit, will be able to continue to say that their \nconstitutional duty ends when they provide relief to the particular Negro children who, as \nindividuals, claim their personal right to be admitted to white schools. If the Briggs thinking \nshould prevail, the dual system will, for all practical purposes, be maintained: white school \nofficials in most key positions at the state and county levels; Negro faculties in Negro \nschools, white faculties in white schools; no white children or only a few white children of \nway-out parents in Negro schools; a few Negroes in some white schools; at best, tokenism \nin certain school districts. \nBrown's broad meaning, its important meaning, is its revitalization of the national \nconstitutional right the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments created in favor \nof Negroes. This is 873*873 the right of Negroes to national citizenship, their right as a class \nto share the privileges and immunities only white citizens had enjoyed as a \nclass. Brown erased Dred Scott, used the Fourteenth Amendment to breathe life into the \nThirteenth, and wrote the Declaration of Independence into the Constitution. Freedmen are \nfree men. They are created as equal as are all other American citizens and with the same \nunalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No longer \"beings of an \ninferior race\" — the Dred Scott article of faith — Negroes too are part of \"the people of the \nUnited States\". \nA primary responsibility of federal courts is to protect nationally created constitutional rights. \nA duty of the States is to give effect to such rights — here, by providing equal educational \nopportunities free of any compulsion that Negroes wear a badge of slavery. The States owe \nthis duty to Negroes, not just because every citizen is entitled to be free from arbitrary \ndiscrimination as a heritage of the common law or because every citizen may look to his \nstate for equal protection of the rights a state grants its citizens. As Justice Harlan clearly \nsaw in the Civil Rights Cases (1883), 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835, the Wartime \nAmendments created an affirmative duty that the States eradicate all relics, \"badges and \nindicia of slavery\" lest Negroes as a race sink back into \"second-class\" citizenship. \nB. The factual situation dealt with in Bell v. School City of Gary, N.D.Ind. 1963, 213 F.Supp. \n819, aff'd 7 Cir. 1963, 324 F.2d 209, cert. den'd 377 U.S. 924, 84 S.Ct. 1223, 12 L.Ed.2d \n216 (1964) is not the situation the Supreme Court had before it in Brown or that we deal \nwith in this circuit. Brown dealt with state-imposed segregation based on dual attendance \nzones. Bell envolved non-racially motivated de facto segregation in a school system based \non the neighborhood single zone system. In Bell the plaintiffs alleged that the Gary School \nBoard had deliberately gerrymandered school attendance zones to achieve a segregated \nschool system in violation of its \"duty to provide and maintain a racially integrated school \nsystem\". On the showing that the students were assigned and boundary lines drawn based \nupon reasonable nonracial criteria, the court held that the school board did not deliberately \n\nsegregate the races; the racial balance was attributable to geographic and housing \npatterns. The court analyzed the problem in terms of state action rather than in terms of the \nNegroes' right to equal educational opportunities. Finding no state action the court \nconcluded that Brown did not apply. In effect, the court held that de facto segregated \nneighborhood schools must be accepted. At any rate, the court said, \"States do not have an \naffirmative, constitutional duty to provide an integrated education\". The Seventh Circuit \naffirmed. \nWe must assume that Congress was well aware of the fact that Bell was concerned with de \nfacto segregated neighborhood schools — only. Notwithstanding the broad language of the \nopinion relating to the lack of a duty to integrate, language later frequently quoted by \nSenator Humphrey and others in the debates on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress \nwent only so far as to prohibit cross-district bussing and cross-district assignment of \nstudents. \nThe facts, as found by the Court in Bell, favored the Gary School Board. Other courts, on \nvery similar facts, have decided that there are alternatives to acceptance of the status \nquo.[80] A commentator 874*874 on the subject has fairly summed up the cases: \n\"Using Brown as a governing principle, racial imbalance caused by racially motivated \nconduct is clearly invalid. When racial imbalance results fortuitously, there is a split of \nauthority.\"[81] \nBarksdale v. Springfield School Committee, D.Mass.1965, 237 F.Supp. 543, similar on the \nfacts to Bell, holds squarely contrary to Bell: \n\"The defendants argue, nevertheless, that there is no constitutional mandate to remedy \nracial imbalance. Bell v. School City of Gary, Indiana, 324 F.2d 209 (7th Cir. 1963). But that \nis not the question. The question is whether there is a constitutional duty to provide equal \neducational opportunities for all children within the system. While Brown answered that \nquestion affirmatively in the context of coerced segregation, the constitutional fact — the \ninadequacy of segregated education — is the same in this case, and I so find. * * * This is \nnot to imply that the neighborhood school policy per se is unconstitutional, but that it must \nbe abandoned or modified when it results in segregation in fact. * * I cannot accept the view \nin Bell that only forced segregation is incompatible with the requirements of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, nor do I find meaningful the statement that `[t]he Constitution * * * does not \nrequire integration. It merely forbids discrimination.' 324 F.2d at 213. * * * ¶ This court \nrecognizes and reiterates that the problem of racial concentration is an educational, as well \nas constitutional, problem and, therefore, orders the defendants to present a plan no later \nthan April 30, 1965, to eliminate to the fullest extent possible 875*875 racial concentration in \nits elementary and junior high schools within the framework of effective educational \nprocedures, as guaranteed by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States.\" (Emphasis added.) \n\"In short, Barksdale [does not analyze Brown] in terms of propriety of school board action, \nbut proceeds in terms of a right on the part of Negro students to an equal educational \nopportunity, which in light of the ruling in Brown that separate schools are inherently \nunequal, must perforce be a right to an integrated educational setting.\"[82] On appeal, the \nFirst Circuit accepted the district court's findings of fact but vacated the order with directions \n\nto dismiss without prejudice because the school board, on its own initiative, had taken \naction identical with the court-ordered action. 348 F.2d 261. The Court noted a difference \nbetween \"the seeming absolutism\" of the opinion and the less sweeping order \"[to] eliminate \n[segregation] to the fullest extent possible * * * within the framework of effective educational \nprocedures\".[83] Taking both opinions together, they recognize that \"the state would not be \npermitted to ignore the problem of de facto segregation. The holding in Brown, unexplained \nby its underlying reasoning, requires no more than the decision in Bell, but when illuminated \nby the reasoning, it permits the result in Barksdale and may require that result.\"[84] At the \nvery least, as the Barksdale court saw it, there is a duty to integrate in the sense that \nintegration is an educational goal to be given a high, high priority among the various \nconsiderations involved in the proper administration of a system beset with de facto \nsegregated schools. \nAlthough Brown points toward the existence of a duty to integrate de facto segregated \nschools,[85] the holding in 876*876 Brown, unlike the holding in Bell but like the holdings in \nthis circuit, occurred within the context of state-coerced segregation. The similarity of \npseudo de facto segregation in the South to actual de facto segregation in the North is more \napparent than real. Here school boards, utilizing the dual zoning system, assigned Negro \nteachers to Negro schools and selected Negro neighborhoods as suitable areas in which to \nlocate Negro schools. Of course the concentration of Negroes increased in the \nneighborhood of the school. Cause and effect came together. In this circuit, therefore, the \nlocation of Negro schools with Negro faculties in Negro neighborhoods and white schools in \nwhite neighborhoods cannot be described as an unfortunate fortuity: It came into existence \nas state action and continues to exist as racial gerrymandering, made possible by the dual \nsystem.[86] Segregation resulting from racially motivated gerrymandering is properly \ncharacterized as \"de jure\" segregation. See Taylor v. Board of Education of City School \nDist. of the City of New Rochelle, S.D.N.Y.1961, 191 F. Supp. 181.[87] The courts have had \nthe power to deal with this situation since Brown I. In Holland v. Board of Public Instruction \nof Palm Beach County, 5 Cir. 1958, 258 F.2d 730, although there was no evidence of \ngerrymandering as such, the court found that the board \"maintained and enforced\" a \ncompletely segregated system by using the neighborhood plan to take advantage of racial \nresidential patterns. See also Evans v. Buchanan, D.Del.1962, 207 F. Supp. 820, where, in \nspite of a genuflexion in the direction of Briggs, the Court found that there was \ngerrymandering of school districts superimposed on a pre-Brown policy of segregation. \nC. The defendants err in their contention that the HEW and the courts cannot take race into \nconsideration in establishing standards for desegregation. \"[T]he Constitution is not this \ncolor-blind.\"[88] \nThe Constitution is both color blind and color conscious. To avoid conflict with the equal \nprotection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm, or imposes a burden \nmust not be based on race. In that sense, the Constitution is color blind. But the \nConstitution is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the \neffects of past discrimination. The criterion is the relevancy of color to a legitimate \ngovernmental purpose. For example, jury venires must represent a cross-section of the \ncommunity. Strauder v. State of West Virginia, 1880, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664. The jury \ncommissioners therefore must have a \"conscious awareness of race in extinguishing racial \ndiscrimination in jury service\". Brooks v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1966, 366 F.2d 1. Similarly, in voter \n\nregistration cases we have used the \"freezing principle\" to justify enjoining the use of a \nconstitutional statute where, in effect, the statute would perpetuate past racial discrimination \nagainst Negroes. 877*877 United States v. State of Louisiana, E.D.La.1963, 225 F.Supp. \n353, aff'd 1965, 380 U.S. 145, 85 S.Ct. 817, 13 L.Ed.2d 709. \"[I]t is unrealistic to suppose \nthat the evils of decades of flagrant racial discrimination can be overcome by purging \nregistration rolls of white voters. * * * [U]nless there is some approriate way to equalize the \npresent with the past, the injunctive prohibitions even in the most stringent, emphatic, \nmandatory terms prohibiting discrimination in the future, continues for many years a \nstructure committing effectual political power to the already registered whites while \nexcluding Negroes from this vital activity of citizenship.\" United States v. Ward, 5 Cir. 1965, \n349 F.2d 795, 802. \"An appropriate remedy * * * should undo the results of past \ndiscrimination as well as prevent future inequality of treatment.\" United States v. Duke, 5 \nCir. 1964, 332 F.2d 759, 768. If the Constitution were absolutely color-blind, consideration \nof race in the census and in adoption proceedings would be unconstitutional. \nHere race is relevant,[89] because the governmental purpose is to offer Negroes equal \neducational opportunities. The means to that end, such as disestablishing segregation \namong students, distributing the better teachers equitably, equalizing facilities, selecting \nappropriate locations for schools, and avoiding resegregation must necessarily be based on \nrace. School officials have to know the racial composition of their school populations and \nthe racial distribution within the school district. The Courts and HEW cannot measure good \nfaith or progress without taking race into account. \"When racial imbalance infects a public \nschool system, there is simply no way to alleviate it without consideration of race. * * * \nThere is no constitutional right to have an inequality perpetuated.\"[90] Judge Sobeloff's \nanswer in Wanner v. County School Board of Arlington County, 4 Cir. 1966, 357 F.2d 452, \n454-455, is our answer in this case: \n\"If a school board is constitutionally forbidden to institute a system of racial segregation by \nthe use of artificial boundary lines, it is likewise forbidden to perpetuate a system that has \nbeen so instituted. It would be stultifying to hold that a board may not move to undo \narrangements artificially contrived to effect or maintain segregation, on the ground that this \ninterference with the status quo would involve `consideration of race.' When school \nauthorities, recognizing the historic fact that existing conditions are based on a design to \nsegregate the races, act to undo these illegal conditions — especially conditions that have \nbeen judicially condemned — their effort is not to be frustrated on the ground that race is \nnot a permissible consideration. This is not the `consideration of race' which the \nConstitution discountenances. * * * There is no legally protected vested interest in \nsegregation. If there were, then Brown v. Board of Education and the numerous decisions \nbased on that case would be pointless. Courts will not 878*878 say in one breath that public \nschool systems may not practice segregation, and in the next that they may do nothing to \neliminate it.\" \nD. Under Briggs's blessing, school boards throughout this circuit first declined to take any \naffirmative action that might be considered a move toward integration. Later, they embraced \nthe Pupil Placement Laws as likely to lead to no more than a little token desegregation. Now \nthey turn to freedom of choice plans supervised by the district courts. As the defendants \nconstrue and administer these plans, without the aid of HEW standards there is little \nprospect of the plans ever undoing past discrimination or of coming close to the goal of \n\nequal educational opportunities. Moreover, freedom of choice, as now administered, \nnecessarily promotes resegregation. The only relief approaching adequacy is the \nconversion of the still-functioning dual system to a unitary, non-racial system — lock, stock, \nand barrel. \nIf this process be \"integration\" according to the 1955 Briggs court, so be it. In 1966 this \nremedy is the relief commanded by Brown, the Constitution, the Past, the Present, and the \nwavy foreimage of the Future. \nIV. \nWe turn now to the specific provisions of the Civil Rights Act on which the defendants rely to \nshow that HEW violates the Congressional intent. These provisions are the amendments to \nTitle IV and VI added in the Senate. The legislative history of these amendments is sparse \nand less authoritative than usual because of the lack of committee reports on the amended \nversion of the bill. \nA. Section 401(b) defines desegregation: \n\"`Desegregation' means the assignment of students to public schools and within such \nschools without regard to their race, color, religion, or national origin, but `desegregation' \nshall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial \nimbalance.\" \nThe affirmative portion of this definition, down to the \"but\" clause, describes the assignment \nprovision necessary in a plan for conversion of a de jure dual system to a unitary, integrated \nsystem. The negative portion, starting with \"but\", excludes assignment to overcome racial \nimbalance, that is acts to overcome de facto segregation. As used in the Act, therefore, \n\"desegregation\" refers only to the disestablishment of segregation in de jure segregated \nschools. Even if a broader meaning should be given to \"assignment * * * to overcome racial \nimbalance\", Section 401 would not mean that such assignments are unlawful: \n\"The intent of the statute is that no funds and no technical assistance will be given by the \nUnited States Commissioner of Education with respect to plans for the assignment of \nstudents to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance. The statute may not be \ninterpreted to mean that such assignment is illegal or that reasonable integration efforts are \narbitrary or unlawful.[91] \nThe prohibition against assignment of students to overcome racial imbalance was added as \nan amendment during the debates in the House to achieve the same result as the anti-\nbussing provision in section 407. Some of the difficulty in understanding the Act and its \nlegislative history arises from the statutory use of the undefined term \"racial imbalance\". It is \nclear however from the hearings and debates that Congress equated the term, as do the \ncommentators, with \"de facto segregation\" that is, non-racially motivated segregation in a \nschool system based on a single neighborhood school for all children in a definable \narea.[92] Thus, 879*879Congressman William Cramer who offered the amendment, was \n\nconcerned that the bill as originally proposed might authorize the government to require \nbussing to overcome de facto segregation. In explaining the amendment, he said: \n\"In the hearings before the committee I raised questions on `racial imbalance' and in the \nsub-committee we had lengthy discussions in reference to having these words stricken in \nthe title, as it then consisted, and to strike out the words `racial imbalance' proposed by the \nadministration. ¶ The purpose is to prevent any semblance of congressional acceptance or \napproval of the concept of `de facto' segregation or to include in the definition of \n`desegregation' any balancing of school attendance by moving students across school \ndistrict lines to level off percentages where one race outweighs another.\" \nThe neighborhood school system is rooted deeply in American culture.[93] Whether its \ncontinued use is constitutional when it leads to grossly imbalanced schools is a question \nsome day to be answered by the Supreme Court, but that question is not present in any of \nthe cases before this Court. As noted in the previous section of this opinion, we have many \ninstances of a heavy concentration of Negroes or whites in certain areas, but always that \ntype of imbalance has been superimposed on total school separation. And always the \nseparation originally was racially motivated and sanctioned 880*880 by law in a system \nbased on two schools within a neighborhood or overlapping neighborhoods, each school \nserving a different race. The situations have some similarity but they have different origins, \ncreate different problems, and require different corrective action.[94] \nIn the 1964 Act (and again in 1966 during consideration of amendments to the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965) Congress, within the context of debates on aid to de \nfacto segregated schools declined to decide just what should be done about imbalanced \nneighborhood schools.[94a] The legislative solution, if there is one to this problem, will require \na carefully conceived and thoroughly debated comprehensive statute. In the 1964 Act \nCongress simply directed that the federal assistance provided in Title IV, §§ 403-405 was \nnot to be used for developing plans to assign pupils to overcome racial \nimbalance.[95] Similarly, Congress withheld authorizing the Attorney General, in school \ndesegregation actions, to ask for a court order calling for bussing pupils from one school to \nanother to \"achieve a racial balance.\"[96] \nB. Section 407(a)(2) of Title IV authorizing the Attorney General to file suit to desegregate, \ncontains the \"anti-bussing\" proviso: \n\"* * * nothing herein shall empower any official or court of the United States to issue any \norder seeking to achieve a racial balance in any school by requiring the transportation of \npupils or students from one school to another or one school district to another in order to \nachieve such racial balance, or otherwise enlarge the existing power of the court to insure \ncompliance with constitutional standards.\" \nFirst, it should be noted that the prohibition applies only to transportation; and only to \ntransportation across school lines to achieve racial balance. The furnishing of transportation \nas part of a freedom of choice plan is not prohibited. Second, the equitable powers of the \ncourts exist independently of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is not contended in the instant \ncases that the Act conferred new authority on the courts. 881*881 And this Court has not \nlooked to the Act as a grant of new judicial authority. \n\nSection 407(a)(2) might be read as applying only to orders issued in suits filed by the \nAttorney General under Title IV. However, Senator, now Vice President Humphrey, Floor \nManager in the Senate, said it was his understanding that the provision applied to the entire \nbill. In particular, he said that it applies to any refusal or termination of federal assistance \nunder Title VI since the procedure for doing so requires an order approved by the President. \nSenator Humphrey explained: \n\"This addition seeks simply to preclude an inference that the title confers new authority to \ndeal with `racial imbalance' in schools, and should serve to soothe fears that Title IV might \nbe read to empower the Federal Government to order the bussing of children around a city \nin order to achieve a certain racial balance or mix in schools. ¶ Furthermore, a new section \n410 would explicitly declare that `nothing in this title shall prohibit classification and \nassignment for reasons other than race, color, religion, or national origin.' ¶ Thus, \nclassification along bona fide neighborhood school lines, or for any other legitimate \nreason which local school boards might see fit to adopt, would not be affected by Title IV, so \nlong as such classification was bona fide. Furthermore, this amendment makes clear that \nthe only Federal intervention in local schools will be for the purpose of preventing denial of \nequal protection of the laws.\" (Emphasis added.) \nSenator Humphrey spoke several times in the language of Briggs but his references \nto Bell indicate that the restrictions in the Act were pointed at the Gary, Indiana de facto \ntype of segregation. Senator Byrd (West Virginia) asked Senator Humphrey would he give \nassurance \"that under Title VI school children may not be bussed from one end of the \ncommunity to another end of the community at taxpayers' expense to relieve so-called \nracial imbalance in the schools\". Senator Humphrey replied: \n\"I do * * *. That language is to be found in Title IV. The provision [§ 407(a)(2)] merely quotes \nthe substance of a recent court decision which I have with me, and which I desire to include \nin the Record today, the so-called Gary case.\" \nSenator Humphrey explained: \n\"Judge Beamer's opinion in the Gary case is significant in this connection. In discussing this \ncase, as we did many times, it was decided to write the thrust of the court's opinion into the \nproposed substitute.\" (Emphasis added.) \nThe thrust of the Gary case (Bell) was that if school districts were drawn without regard to \nrace, but rather on the basis of such factors as density of population, travel distances, \nsafety of the children, costs of operating the school system, and convenience to parents \nand children, those districts are valid even if there is a racial imbalance caused by \ndiscriminatory practices in housing. Thus, continuing his explanation, Senator Humphrey \nsaid: \n\"The bill does not attempt to integrate the schools, but it does attempt to eliminate \nsegregation in the schools. The natural factors, such as density of population, and the \ndistance that students would have to travel are considered legitimate means to determine \nthe validity of a school district, if the school districts are not gerry-mandered, and in effect \ndeliberately segregated. The fact that there is a racial imbalance per se is not something \n\nwhich is unconstitutional. That is why we have attempted to clarify it with the language of \nSection 4.\" (Emphasis added.) \nC. Section 601 states the general purpose of Title VI of the Act: \n\"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" (Emphasis added.) \n882*882 This is a clear congressional statement that racial discrimination against the \nbeneficiaries of federal assistance is unlawful. Children attending schools which receive \nfederal assistance are of course among the beneficiaries. In the House, Congressman \nCeller explained: \n\"The legality is based on the general power of Congress to apply reasonable conditions. * * \n* ¶ In general, it seems rather anomalous that the Federal Government should aid and abet \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin by granting money and other \nkinds of financial aid. It seems rather shocking, moreover, that while we have on the one \nhand the 14th amendment, which is supposed to do away with discrimination since it \nprovides for equal protection of the laws, on the other hand, we have the Federal \nGovernment aiding and abetting those who persist in practicing racial discrimination.\" \nIn the Senate, Senator Javits, an assistant floor-manager, expressed concern as to the \nclarity of the statement of policy: \n\"I ask the Senator whether we now have a clear understanding that if title VI shall be \nenacted as it is now proposed, the express and clear policy of Congress against aiding \ndiscrimination will prevail * * *.\" \nSenator Humphrey answered: \n\"Some Federal agencies appear to have been reluctant to act in this area. Title VI will \nrequire them to act. Its enactment will thus serve to insure uniformity and permanence to \nthe nondiscrimination policy.\" \nD. Section 604 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-3 is the section the defendants principally rely \nupon and the section most misunderstood.[97] It provides: \n\"Nothing contained in this title shall be construed to authorize action under this title by any \ndepartment or agency with respect to any employment practice of any \nemployer, employment agency, or labor organization except where a primary objective of \nthe Federal financial assistance is to provide employment.\" (Emphasis added.) \nThe defendants contend that this section bars any action requiring desegregation of \nfaculties and school personnel. \nSection 604 was not a part of the original House bill. Senator Humphrey, while introducing \nthe Act explained: \"[The] Commissioner might also be justified in requiring elimination of \n\nracial discrimination in employment or assignment of teachers, at least where such \ndiscrimination affected the educational opportunities of students. See Braxton v. Board of \nPublic Instruction of Duval County, 5 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 616.\" 110 Cong.Rec. p. 6345. That \nwas in March 1964. In June 1964, in explaining the amendments, Senator Humphrey said, \n\"This provision is in line with the provisions of section 602[98] and serves to spell out more \nprecisely the declared scope of coverage of the title.\" In the same speech he stated (110 \nC.R. 12714): \"We have made no changes of substance in Title VI.\" This explanation plainly \nindicates that the amendment was not intended as a statutory bar to faculty integration in \nschools receiving federal aid. \nHowever, in the interval between these two explanations the Attorney General, in response \nto a letter from Senator Cooper, stated that Section 602 would not apply to federally aided \nemployers who discriminated in employment practices: \"Title VI is limited * * * to \ndiscrimination against the beneficiaries of federal assistance programs. * * * Where, \nhowever, employees are the intended beneficiaries of a program, Title VI would \napply.\"[99] He gave as an example accelerated public works programs. It was after the \nreceipt of the Attorney General's letter that the amended Senate 883*883 bill was passed. \nThe school boards argue therefore that Section 604 was enacted, because of the Attorney \nGeneral's interpretation, to exclude interference with employment practices of schools. \nIn its broadest application this argument would allow racial discrimination in the hiring, \ndischarge, and assignment of teachers. In its narrowest application this argument would \nallow discrimination in hiring and discharging but not in assigning teachers, an inexplicable \nanomaly.[100] There is no merit to this argument. Section 604 and the Attorney General's \nletter are not inconsistent, since under Section 601 it is the school children, not the teachers \n(employees), who are the primary beneficiaries of federal assistance to public schools. \nFaculty integration is essential to student desegregation. To the extent that teacher \ndiscrimination jeopardizes the success of desegregation, it is unlawful wholly aside from its \neffect upon individual teachers. \nAfter Section 601 was proposed, additional clarifying language was suggested to make it \nclear that discrimination in certain employer-employee relationships, not affecting the \nintended beneficiaries of the program, would be excluded from the reach of the statute. See \nHearings, H.R.Comm. on Rules, H.R. 7152, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964), pp. 94, 226; 110 \nC.R. 6544-46 (Senator Humphrey). For example, there was a serious question as to \nwhether the bill would forbid a farmer who was receiving benefits under the Agricultural \nAdjustment Act from discriminating upon the basis of race in the selection of his employees. \nHearings, H.R.Comm. on Rules, H.R. 7152, 88 Cong., 2d Sess., 1964, p. 94, 110 C.R. 6545 \n(Senator Humphrey). The addition of Section 604 to the bill as originally proposed clearly \nexcluded the application of the Act to this type of situation. Congress did not, of course, \nintend to provide a forum for the relief of individual teachers who might be discriminatorily \ndischarged; Congress was interested in a general requirement essential to success of the \nprogram as a whole.[101] \nCollaterally to their argument on Section 604, the defendants cite Section 701 (b) of Title \nVII, covering Equal Employment Opportunities, which specifically excepts a \"state or \npolitical subdivision thereof\". This section has no application to schools. Section 701(b), \n\ndefines \"employer\" as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has \ntwenty-five or more employees * * *.\" \nSection 604 was never intended as a limitation on desegregation of schools. If the \ndefendants' view of Section 604 were correct the purposes of the statute would be \nfrustrated, for one of the keys to desegregation is integration of faculty. As long as a school \nhas a Negro faculty it will always have a Negro student body. As the District Court for the \nWestern District of Virginia put it in Brown v. County School Board of Frederick County, \n1965, 245 F. Supp. 549, 560: \n\"[T]he presence of all Negro teachers in a school attended solely by Negro pupils in the \npast denotes that school a `colored school' just as certainly as if the words were printed \nacross its entrance in six-inch letters.\" \nAs far as possible federal courts must carry out congressional policy. But we must not \noverlook the fact that \"we deal here with constitutional rights and not with those established \nby 884*884 statute\".[102] The right of Negro students to be free from racial discrimination in \nthe form of a segregated faculty is part of their broader right to equal educational \nopportunities. The \"mandate of Brown * * * forbids the [discriminatory consideration of race \nin faculty selection just as it forbids it in pupil placement.\" Chambers v. Hendersonville City \nBoard of Education, 4 Cir. 1966, 364 F.2d 189. \nIn Brown II the Supreme Court specifically referred to the reallocation of staff as one of the \nreasons permitting desegregation \"with all deliberate speed\". In determining the additional \ntime necessary \"* * * courts may consider problems related to administration, arising from * \n* * personnel * * *.\" (Emphasis added.) 349 U.S. at 300, 75 S.Ct. at 756. For ten years, \nhowever, this Court and other circuit courts[103] had approved district courts' postponing \nhearings on faculty desegregation. Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmon, 1965, \n382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 put an end to this practice. In Bradley the \nSupreme Court held that faculty segregation had a direct impact on desegregation plans. \nThe court summarily remanded the case to the district court holding that it was improper for \nthat court to approve a desegregation plan without considering, at a full evidentiary hearing, \nthe impact of faculty allocation on a racial basis. The Court said, \"[There is] no merit to the \nsuggestion that relation between faculty allocation on an alleged racial basis and the \nadequacy of the desegregation plans are entirely speculative.\" Moreover, \"Delays in \ndesegregating school systems are no longer tolerable.\" 382 U.S. at 105, 86 S. Ct. at 226. \nIn Rogers v. Paul, 1965, 382 U.S. 198, 200, 86 S.Ct. 358, 360, 15 L. Ed.2d 265, the \nSupreme Court held that Negro students in grades not yet desegregated were entitled to an \nimmediate transfer to a white high school. They \"plainly had standing\" to sue on two \ntheories: (1) \"that racial allocation of faculty denies them equality of educational opportunity \nwithout regard to segregation of pupils; and (2) that it renders inadequate an otherwise \nconstitutional pupil desegregation plan soon to be applied to their grades.\" In Singleton \nII this Court, relying on Bradley, held that it was \"essential\" for the Jackson schools to make \nan \"adequate start toward elimination of race as a basis for the employment and allocation \nof teachers, administrators, and other personnel.\" 355 F.2d at 870. \nIn a recent decision of the Eighth Circuit, Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School \nDistrict, 369 F.2d 661, December 15, 1966, the Court required a \"positive program aimed at \n\nending in the near future the segregation of the teaching and operating staff\". The Court \nstated: \"We agree that faculty segregation encourages pupil segregation and is detrimental \nto achieving a constitutionally required non-racially operated school system. It is clear that \nthe Board may not continue to operate a segregated teaching staff. * * * It is also clear that \nthe time for delay is past. The desegregation of the teaching staff should have begun many \nyears ago. At this point the Board is going to have to take accelerated and positive action to \nend discriminatory practices in staff assignment and recruitment.\" \nIn Braxton v. Board of Public Instruction of Duval County, 1964, 326 F.2d 616, 620, cert. \ndenied 377 U.S. 924, 84 S.Ct. 1223, 12 L.Ed.2d 216, the case cited by Senator Humphrey, \nthis Court affirmed an order of the district court prohibiting assignment of \"teachers and \nother personnel * * * on a racially segregated basis.\" In Smith v. Board of Education of \nMorrilton, 8 Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 770, 778, the Court said: \n\"It is our firm conclusion that the reach of the Brown decisions, although 885*885 they \nspecifically concerned only pupil discrimination, clearly extends to the proscription of the \nemployment and assignment of public school teachers on a racial basis. Cf. United Public \nWorkers [of America (CIO)] v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 100, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 \n(1947); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 191-192, 73 S.Ct. 215, 97 L.Ed. 216 (1952). \nSee Colorado Anti-Discrimination Comm'n v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 372 U.S. 714, 721, \n83 S.Ct. 1022, 10 L.Ed.2d 84 (1963). This is particularly evident from the Supreme Court's \npositive indications that nondiscriminatory allocation of faculty is indispensable to the \nvalidity of a desegregation plan. Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, \nsupra; Rogers v. Paul, supra. This court has already said, `Such discrimination [failure to \nintegrate the teaching staff] is proscribed by Brown and also the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nand the regulations promulgated thereunder'. Kemp v. Beasley, supra, p. 22 of 352 F.2d.\" \nIn Wheeler v. Durham City Board of Education, 4 Cir. 1966, 363 F.2d 738, 740 the Court \nstated: \"We read [Bradley] as authority for the proposition that removal of race \nconsiderations from faculty selection and allocation is, as a matter of law, an inseparable \nand indispensable command within the abolition of pupil segregation in public schools as \npronounced in Brown v. Board of Education, supra, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686. Hence no \nproof of the relationship of faculty allocation and pupil assignment was required here. The \nonly factual issue is whether race was a factor entering into the employment and placement \nof teachers.\" In Wright v. County School Board of Greensville County, E.D.Va.1966, 252 \nF.Supp. 378, 384, holding that a faculty desegregation provision approved by the \nCommissioner of Education was not sufficient, the court said: \n\"The primary responsibility for the selection of means to achieve employment and \nassignment of staff on a non-racial basis rests with the school board. * * * Several principles \nmust be observed by the board. Token assignments will not suffice. The elimination of a \nracial basis for the employment and assignment of staff must be achieved at the earliest \npracticable date. The plan must contain well defined procedures which will be put into effect \non definite dates. The board will be allowed ninety days to submit amendments to its plan \ndealing with staff employment and assignment practices.\" \nIn Kier v. County School Board of Augusta County, W.D.Va.1966, 249 F.Supp. 239, \n246, the court held that free choice plans require faculty integration: \n\n\"Freedom of choice, in other words, does not mean a choice between a clearly delineated \n`Negro school' (having an all-Negro faculty and staff) and a `white school' (with all-white \nfaculty and staff). School authorities who have heretofore operated dual school systems for \nNegroes and whites must assume the duty of eliminating the effects of dualism before a \nfreedom of choice plan can be superimposed upon the pre-existing situation and approved \nas a final plan of desegregation. It is not enough to open the previously all-white schools to \nNegro students who desire to go there while all-Negro schools continue to be maintained as \nsuch. * * * The duty rests with the School Board to overcome the discrimination of the past, \nand the long-established image of the `Negro school' can be overcome under freedom of \nchoice only by the presence of an integrated faculty.\" \nSee also Dowell v. School Board of Oklahoma City Public Schools, W.D.Okla.1965, 244 \nF.Supp. 971, 977, aff'd, 10 Cir. Jan. 23, 1967, 375 F.2d 158,and Franklin v. County School \nBoard of Giles County, 4 Cir. 1966, 360 F.2d 325. \nWe cannot impute to Congress an intention to repudiate Senator Humphrey's explanation of \nSection 604 and to change the substance of Title VI, tearing the vitals from the statutory \nobjective. Integration of faculty is indispensable to the success of desegregation plan. \nNor 886*886 can we impute to Congress the intention to license, unconstitutionally, \ndiscrimination in the employment and assignment of teachers, a conspicuous badge of de \njure segregated schools.[104] \nE. As we construe the Act and its legislative history, especially the sponsors' reliance \non Bell, Congress, because of its hands-off attitude on bona fide neighborhood school \nsystems, qualified its broad policy of nondiscrimination by precluding HEW's requiring the \nbussing of children across district lines or requiring compulsory placement of children in \nschools to strike a balance when the imbalance results from de facto, that is, non-racially \nmotivated segregation. As Congressman Cramer said, \"De facto segregration is racial \nimbalance\". But there is nothing in the language of the Act or in the legislative history that \nequates corrective acts to desegregate or to integrate a dual school system initially based \non de jure segregation with acts to bring about a racial balance in a system based on bona \nfide neighborhood schools. \nCongress recognized that HEW's requirements for qualifying for financial assistance are \none thing and the courts' constitutional and judicial responsibilities are something else \nagain. The Act states, therefore, that it did not enlarge the court's existing powers to ensure \ncompliance with constitutional standards. But neither did it reduce the courts' power. \nV. \nThe HEW Guidelines agree with decisions of this circuit and of the similarly situated Fourth \nand Eight Circuits. And they stay within the Congressional mandate. There is no cross-\ndistrict or cross-town bussing requirement. There is no provision requiring school authorities \nto place white children in Negro schools or Negro children in white schools for the purpose \nof striking a racial balance in a school or school district proportionate to the racial population \nof the community or school district.[105] The provision referring to percentages is a general \nrule of thumb or 887*887 objective administrative guide for measuring progress in \n\ndesegregation rather than a firm requirement that must be met.[106] See footnotes 105 and \n106. Good faith in compliance should be measured by performance, not promises. \nIn reviewing the effectiveness of an approved plan it seems reasonable to use some sort of \nyardstick or objective percentage guide. The percentage requirements in the Guidelines are \nmodest, suggesting only that systems using free choice plans for at least two years should \nexpect 15 to 18 per cent of the pupil population to have selected desegregated schools. \nThis Court has frequently relied on percentages in jury exclusion cases. Where the \npercentage of Negroes on the jury and jury venires is disproportionately low compared with \nthe Negro population of a county, a prima facie case is made for deliberate discrimination \nagainst Negroes.[107] Percentages have been used in other civil rights cases.[108]A similar \ninference may be drawn in school desegregation cases, when the number of Negroes \nattending school with white children is manifestly out of line with the ratio of Negro school \nchildren to white school children in public schools. 888*888 Common sense suggests that a \ngross discrepancy between the ratio of Negroes to white children in a school and the HEW \npercentage guides raises an inference that the school plan is not working as it should in \nproviding a unitary, integrated system. Thus Evans v. Buchanan, D.C. Del.1962, 207 \nF.Supp. 820[109]held that this natural inference coupled with the board's possessing but \nfailing to come forth with the probative facts that might rebut the inference created a \npresumption that the proposed desegregation plan was unconstitutional. \nThe Guidelines were adopted for the entire country. However, they have been formulated in \na context sympathetic with local problems. Sections 403-405 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \nprovide that, upon request, the Commissioner of Education may render technical assistance \nto public school systems engaged in desegregation. The Commissioner may also establish \ntraining institutes to counsel school personnel having educational problems occasioned by \ndesegregation; and the Commissioner may make grants to school boards to defray the \ncosts of providing in-service training on desegregation. In short, the Commissioner may \nassist those school boards who allege that they will have difficulty complying with the \nguidelines. When desegregation plans do not meet minimum standards, the school \nauthorities should ask HEW for assistance. And district courts should invite HEW to assist \nby giving advice on raising the levels of the plans and by helping to coordinate a school's \npromises with the school's performance. In view of the competent assistance HEW may \nfurnish schools, there is a heavy burden on proponents of the argument that their schools \ncannot meet HEW standards. \nVI. \nSchool authorities in this circuit, with few exceptions, have turned to the \"freedom of choice\" \nmethod for desegregating public schools. The method has serious shortcomings. Indeed, \nthe \"slow pace of integration in the Southern and border States is in large measure \nattributable to the manner in which free choice plans * * * have operated.\"[110] When such \nplans leave school officials with a broad area of uncontrolled discretion, this method of \ndesegregation is better suited than any other to preserve the essentials of the dual school \nsystem while giving paper compliance with the duty to desegregate. \nA free choice plan does not abandon geographical criteria, but requires no rigid adherence \nto attendance zones. Theoretically every child may choose his school, but its effectiveness \n\ndepends on the availability of open places in balanced schools. Moreover, unless there is \nsome provision to prevent white children transferring out of an imbalanced 889*889 school \nthis plan will promote resegregation.[111] \n\"Under freedom of choice plans, schools tend to retain their racial identification.\"[112] Such \nplans require affirmative action by parents and pupils to disestablish the existing system of \npublic schools. In this circuit white students rarely choose to attend schools identified as \nNegro schools. Negro students who choose white schools are, as we know from many \ncases, only Negroes of exceptional initiative and fortitude. New construction and \nimprovements to the Negro school plant attract no white students and diminish Negro \nmotivation to ask for transfer. Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit has approved freedom of \nchoice plans \"as a permissible method at this stage\", although recognizing that such a plan \n\"is still only in the experimental stage and it has not yet been demonstrated that such a \nmethod will fully implement the decision of Brown and subsequent cases and the legislative \ndeclaration of § 2000(d) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\"[113] We have said: \"At this stage in \nthe history of desegregation in the deep South a `freedom of choice plan' is an acceptable \nmethod for a school board to use in fulfilling its duty to integrate the school system. In the \nlong run, it is hardly possible that schools will be administered on any such haphazard \nbasis\". Singleton II, 355 F. 2d at 871. HEW recognizes freedom of choice as a permissible \nmeans of desegregation. See Revised Guidelines, Subpart B, 181.11, and all of Subpart D. \nCourts should scrutinize all such plans. Freedom of choice plans \"may * * * be invalid \nbecause the `freedom of choice' is illusory. The plan must be tested not only by its \nprovisions, but by the manner in which it operates to provide opportunities for a \ndesegregated education.\" Wright v. County School Board of Greenville County, \nE.D.Va.1966, 252 F.Supp. 378, 383. In that case the court was concerned that \"operation \nunder the plan may show that the transportation policy or the capacity of the schools \nseverely limits freedom of choice, although provisions concerning these phases are valid on \ntheir face\". In Lockett v. Board of Education of Muskogee County, Ga., 5 Cir. 1965, 342 \nF.2d 225, we were concerned that \"proper notice\" be given so that \"Negro students are \nafforded a reasonable and conscious opportunity to apply for admission to any school which \nthey are otherwise eligible to attend without regard to race\". Also, as Judge Bell, for the \nCourt, pointed out, \"a necessary part of any plan is a provision that the dual or biracial \nschool attendance system * * * be abolished.\" See also Dowell v. School Board of \nOklahoma City Public Schools, W.D. Okla.1965, 244 F.Supp. 971, aff'd, 10 Cir. Jan. 23, \n1967, 375 F.2d 158; Bell v. School Board of City of Staunton, W.D. Va.1966, 249 F.Supp. \n249; Kier v. County School Board of Augusta County, W. D.Va.1966, 249 F.Supp. 239. \nThere is much that school authorities should do to meet their responsibilities: \n\"[Brown] called for responsible public officials throughout the country to \nreappraise 890*890 their thinking and policies, and to make every effort to afford Negroes \nthe more meaningful equality guaranteed them by the Constitution. The Brown decision, in \nshort, was a lesson in democracy, directed to the public at large and more particularly to \nthose responsible for the operation of the schools. It imposed a legal and moral obligation \nupon officials who had created or maintained segregated schools to undo the damage \nwhich they had fostered.\" Taylor v. Board of Education of City School Dist. of the City of \n\nNew Rochelle, S.D.N.Y.1961, 191 F.Supp. 181, 187, aff'd 294 F.2d 36, cert. den'd 368 U.S. \n940, 82 S.Ct. 382 (1961). \nSchool officials should consult with Negro and white school authorities before plans are put \nin final form. They should see that notices of plans and procedures are clear and timely. \nThey should avoid the discriminatory use of tests and the use of birth and health certificates \nto make transfers difficult. They should eliminate inconvenient or burdensome \narrangements for transfer, such as requiring the personal appearance of parents, notarized \nforms, signatures of both parents, or making forms available at inconvenient times to \nworking people. They should employ forms which do not designate the name of a Negro \nschool as the choice or contain a \"waiver\" of the \"right\" to attend white schools. Certainly \nschool officials should not discourage Negro children from enrolling in white schools, \ndirectly or indirectly, as for example, by advising them that they would not be permitted to \nengage or would not want to engage in school activities, athletics, the band, clubs, school \nplays. If transportation is provided for white children, the schedules should be re-routed to \nprovide for Negro children. Overcrowding should not be used as an excuse to avoid \ntransfers of Negro children. In Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 4 Cir. 1965, \n345 F.2d 310, 323, Judges Sobeloff and Bell, concurring, said: \n\"A plan of desegregation is more than a matter of words. The attitude and purpose of public \nofficials, school administrators and faculties are an integral part of any plan and determine \nits effectiveness more than the words employed. If these public agents translate their duty \ninto affirmative and sympathetic action the plan will work; if their spirit is obstructive, or at \nbest negative, little progress will be made, no matter what form of words may be used\" \nFreedom of choice means the maximum amount of freedom and clearly understood choice \nin a bona fide unitary system where schools are not white schools or Negro schools — just \nschools. \nWe turn now to a discussion of the specific elements of a freedom of choice plan that make \nit more than a mere word of promise to the ear. \nA. Speed of Desegregation. The announced speed of desegregation no longer seems to be \na critical issue. The school boards generally concede that by the school year 1967-\n68 all grades should be desegregated. \nB. Mandatory Annual Free Choice. Underlying and tending to counteract the effectiveness \nof all the freedom of choice plans before the Court is the initial unconstitutional assignment \nof all students by race. When the freedom of choice plan is \"permissive\" or \"voluntary\" the \neffect is to superimpose the same old transfer plan on racial assignments and dual zones. \nWe hold that any freedom of choice plan is inadequate if based upon a preliminary system \nof assignment by race or dual geographic zones. See Singleton II, and Lockett v. Board of \nEducation of Muscogee County, Ga., 5 Cir. 1965, 342 F.2d 225, restating the requirement \nof Stell v. Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1964, 333 F.2d \n55 and Gaines v. Dougherty County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1964, 334 F.2d 983. It is \nessential that dual or biracial school attendance systems be abolished \ncontemporaneously 891*891 with the application of a plan to the respective grades reached \nby it. \n\nIn place of permissive freedom of choice there must be a mandatory annual free choice of \nschools by all students, both white and Negro. \"If a child or his parent is to be given a \nmeaningful choice, this choice must be afforded annually.\" Kemp v. Beasley, 8 Cir. 1965, \n352 F.2d 14, 22. The initial choice of assignment, within space limitations, should be made \nby a parent or by a child over fifteen without regard to race. This mandatory free choice \nsystem would govern even the initial assignment of students to the first grade and to \nkindergarten. At the minimum, a freedom of choice plan should provide that: (1) all students \nin desegregated grades shall have an opportunity to exercise a choice of schools. Bradley \nv. School Board of the City of Richmond, 4 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 310, vacated and \nremanded, 1965, 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187; (2) where the number of \napplicants applying to a school exceeds available space, preferences will be determined by \na uniform non-racial standard, Stell v. Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education, 5 \nCir. 1964, 333 F.2d 55, 65; and (3) when a student fails to exercise his choice, he will be \nassigned to a school under a uniform non-racial standard, Kemp v. Beasley, 8 Cir. 1965, \n352 F.2d 14, 22. \nC. Notice. The notice provisions of the HEW Guidelines are reasonable and should be \nfollowed. Where public notice by publication in a newspaper will assure adequate notice, \nindividual notice will not be necessary. Individual notice should be required if notice by \npublication is likely to be inadequate. \nD. Transfers for Students in Non-desegregated Grades and with Special \nNeeds. In Singleton II we held that children in still-segregated grades in Negro schools \n\"have an absolute right, as individuals, to transfer to schools from which they were excluded \nbecause of their race.\"[114] 355 F.2d at 869. See also Rogers v. Paul, 1965, 382 U.S. 198, \n86 S.Ct. 358, 15 L.Ed.2d 265. A transfer provision should be included in the plan. The right \nto transfer under a state Pupil Placement Law should be regarded as an additional right that \ntakes into consideration criteria irrelevant to the absolute right referred to in Rogers v. Paul. \nE. Services, Facilities, Activities, and Programs. In Singleton II we held that there should be \nno segregation or discrimination in services, facilities, activities, and programs that may be \nconducted or sponsored by, or affiliated with, the school in which a student is enrolled. We \nhave in mind school athletics and inter-scholastic associations of course, but also parents-\nteachers associations. In order to eliminate any uncertainty on this point, we hold that the \nplan should contain a statement that there will be no such segregation or discrimination. \nF. School Equalization. In recent years, as we are all well aware, Southern states have \nexerted great effort to improve Negro school plants. There are however many old and \ninferior schools readily identifiable as Negro schools; there are also many superior white \nschools, in terms of the quality of instruction. A freedom of choice plan will be ineffective if \nthe students cannot choose among schools that are substantially equal. A school plan \ntherefore should provide for closing inferior schools and should also include a provision for \nremedial programs to overcome past inadequacies of all-Negro 892*892 schools. This will, of \ncourse, require the local school authorities and the trial courts to examine carefully local \nsituations and perhaps seek advice from qualified, unbiased authorities in the field. \nG. Scheduled Compliance Reports. Scheduled compliance reports to the court on the \nprogress of freedom of choice plans are a necessity and of benefit to all the parties. These \n\nshould be required following the choice period and again after the opening of school. None \nof the school boards expressly objected to this provision, or one similar to it, and it does not \nappear onerous. \nH. Desegregation of Faculty and Staff. The most difficult problem in the desegregation \nprocess is the integration of faculties. See Section IV D of this opinion. A recent survey \nshows that until the 1966-67 session not a single Negro teacher in Alabama, Louisiana, or \nMississippi has been assigned to a school where there are white teachers.[115] As evidenced \nin numerous records, this long continued policy has resulted in inferior Negro teaching and \nin inferior education of Negroes as a class. Everyone agrees, on principle, that the selection \nand assignment of teachers on merit should not be sacrificed just for the sake of integrating \nfaculties; teaching is an art. Yet until school authorities recognize and carry out their \naffirmative duty to integrate faculties as well as facilities, there is not the slightest possibility \nof their ever establishing an operative non-discriminatory school system.[116] The transfer of \na few Negro children to a white school does not do away with the dual system. A Negro \nfaculty makes a Negro school; the Negro school continues to offer inferior educational \nopportunities; and the school system continues its psychological harm to Negroes as a \nclass by not putting them on an equal level with white children as a class.[117] To prevent \nsuch harm or to undo the harm, or to prevent resegregation, the school authorities, even in \nthe administration of an otherwise rational, nondiscriminatory policy, should take corrective \naction involving racial criteria. As we pointed out (see Section III C), in fashioning an \nappropriate remedy tending to undo past discrimination this Court has often taken race into \naccount. \nIn the past year, district courts have struggled with the problem of framing effective orders \nfor the desegregation of faculty. (1) Some courts have focused upon the specific results to \nbe reached by reassignment of teachers previously assigned solely upon the basis of their \nrace. Dowell v. School Board of Oklahoma City Public Schools, W.D.Okla. 1965, 244 \nF.Supp. 971, aff'd, 10 Cir. Jan. 23, 1967, 375 F.2d 158; Kier v. County School Board of \nAugusta County, W.D. Va.1966, 249 F.Supp. 239.[118] The orders entered in these cases \nrequire the defendant school boards to assign any 893*893 newly employed teachers and \nreassign already-employed faculty so that the proportion of each race assigned to teach in \neach school will be the same as the proportion of teachers of that race in the total teaching \nstaff in the system, or at least, of the particular school level in which they are employed. (2) \nOther courts have not been specific as to the number of teachers of each race that should \nbe assigned to each school in order to remove the effects of past discriminatory \nassignments. These courts have focused upon the mechanics to be followed in removing \nthe effect of past discrimination rather than upon the result as such. Thus, in Beckett v. \nSchool Board of the City of Norfolk, Civil Action No. 2214 (E.D.Va., 1966); Gilliam v. School \nBoard of the City of Hopewell, Civil Action No. 3554 (E.D.Va.1966); and Bradley v. School \nBoard of the City of Richmond, Civil Action No. 3353 (E. D.Va.1966), the courts approved \nconsent decrees setting forth in detail the considerations that would control the school \nadministrators in filling faculty vacancies and in transferring already employed faculty \nmembers in order to facilitate faculty integration. (3) In a third group of cases, the district \ncourt, while emphasizing the necessity of affirmative steps to undo the effects of past racial \nassignments of faculty and while requiring some tangible results, has not been specific \nregarding the mechanics or the specific results to be achieved. See Harris v. Bullock County \nBoard of Education, M.D.Ala.1966, 253 F.Supp. 276; United States v. Lowndes Board of \n\nEducation, Civil Action No. 2328-N (M.D.Ala.1966); Carr v. Montgomery County Board of \nEducation, M.D. Ala.1966, 253 F.Supp. 306. \nWe agree with the Eighth Circuit's statement: \"The lack of a definite program will only result \nin further delay of long overdue action. We are not content at this late date to approve a \ndesegregation plan that contains only a statement of general good intention. We deem a \npositive commitment to a reasonable program aimed at ending segregation of the teaching \nstaff to be necessary for the final approval of a constitutionally adequate desegregation \nplan.\" Clark v. Board of Education of the Little Rock School District, 369 F.2d \n661, December 15, 1966. In that case the Court did not impose \"a set time with fixed \nmathematical requirements\". However the Court was firm in its position: \"First, as the Board \nhas already positively pledged, future employment, assignment, transfer, and discharge of \nteachers must be free from racial consideration. Two, should the desegregation process \ncause the closing of schools employing individuals predominately of one race, the displaced \npersonnel should, at the very minimum, be absorbed into vacancies appearing in the \nsystem. Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton School District, No. 32, supra. Third, \nwhenever possible, requests of individual staff members to transfer into minority situations \nshould be honored by the Board. Finally, we believe the Board should make all additional \npositive commitments necessary to bring about some measure of racial balance in the staffs \nof the individual schools in the very near future. The age old distinction of `white schools' \nand `Negro schools' must be erased. The continuation of such distinctions only perpetrates \ninequality of educational opportunity and places in jeopardy the effective future operation of \nthe entire `freedom of choice' type plan.\" \nIn Singleton I we agreed with the original HEW Guidelines in requiring that an \"adequate \nstart\" toward faculty desegregation should be made in 1966-67. The requirement that all \ngrades be desegregated in 1967-68 increases the need for substantial progress beyond an \n\"adequate start\". It is essential that school officials (1) cease practicing racial discrimination \nin the hiring and assignment of new faculty members and (2) take affirmative programmatic \nsteps to correct existing effects of past racial assignment. If these two requirements are \nprescribed, the district court should be able to add specifics to meet the particular situation \nthe case presents. 894*894 The goal should be an equitable distribution of the better \nteachers.[119] We anticipate that when district courts and this Court have gained more \nexperience with faculty integration, the Court will be able to set forth standards more \nspecifically than they are set forth in the decrees in the instant cases. \nVII. \nWe attach a decree to be entered by the district courts in these cases consolidated on \nappeal. See Appendix A. \nWe have carefully examined each of the records in these cases. In each instance the record \nsupports the decree. However, the provisions of the decree are intended, as far as possible, \nto apply uniformly throughout this circuit in cases involving plans based on free choice of \nschools. School boards, private plaintiffs, and the United States may, of course, come into \ncourt to prove that exceptional circumstances compel modification of the decree. For \nexample, school systems in areas which let school out during planting and harvesting \n\nseasons may find that the period for exercise of choice of schools, March 1-31, should be \nchanged to a different month. \nAs Brown dictates, the decree places responsibility on the school authorities to take \naffirmative action to bring about a unitary, non-racial system. As the Constitution dictates, \nthe proof of the pudding is in the eating: the proof of a school board's compliance with \nconstitutional standards is the result — the performance. Has the operation of the promised \nplan actually eliminated segregated and token-desegregated schools and achieved \nsubstantial integration? \nThe substantive requirements of the decree derive from the Fourteenth Amendment as \ninterpreted by decisions of the Supreme Court and of this Court, in many instances before \nthe HEW Guidelines were published. For administrative details, we have looked to the \nOffice of Education. For example, those familiar with the HEW Guidelines will note that the \ndecree follows the Guidelines exactly as to the form letters which go to parents announcing \nthe need to exercise a choice of schools, and the forms for exercising that choice are the \nsame. Indeed a close parallel will be noted between much in Parts II through V of the \ndecree and the Guideline provisions. \nThe great bulk of the school districts in this circuit have applied for federal financial \nassistance and therefore operate under voluntary desegregation plans.[120]Approval of these \nplans by the Office of 895*895 Education qualifies the schools for federal aid. In this opinion \nwe have held that the HEW Guidelines now in effect are constitutional and are within the \nstatutory authority created in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Schools therefore, in compliance \nwith the Guidelines can in general be regarded as discharging constitutional obligations. \nSome schools have made no move to desegregate or have had plans rejected as \nunsatisfactory by district courts or the HEW. We expect the provisions of the decree to be \napplied in proceedings involving such schools. Other schools have earlier court-approved \nplans which fall short of the terms of the decree. On motion by proper parties to re-open \nthese cases, we expect these plans to be modified to conform with our decree. In some \ncases the parties may challenge various aspects of HEW-approved plans. Our approval of \nthe existing Guidelines and the deference owed to any future Guidelines is not intended to \ndeny a day in court to any person asserting individual rights or to any school board \ncontesting HEW action.[121] In any school desegregation case the issue concerns the \nconstitutional rights of Negroes, individually and as a class, and the constitutional rights of \nthe State — not the issue whether federal financial assistance should be withheld under \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nWhen school systems are under court-ordered desegregation, the courts are responsible for \ndetermining the sufficiency of the system's compliance with the decree. The courts' task, \ntherefore, is a continuing process, especially in major areas readily susceptible of \nobservation and measurement, such as faculty integregation and student desegregation. (1) \nAs to faculty, we have found that school authorities have an affirmative duty to break up the \nhistorical pattern of segregated faculties, the hall-mark of the dual system. To aid the courts \nin its task, the decree requires the school authorities to report to the district courts the \nprogress made toward faculty integration. The school authorities bear the burden of \njustifying an apparent lack of progress.[122] (2) As to students, the decree requires school \n\nauthorities to make reports to the court showing by race, by school, by grade, the choices \nmade in each \"choice period\". A similar report is required after schools open to show what \nactually happened when schools opened. \nWhat the decree contemplates, then, is continuing judicial evaluation of compliance by \nmeasuring the performance — not merely the promised performance — of school boards in \ncarrying out their constitutional obligation \"to disestablish dual, racially segregated school \nsystems and to achieve substantial integration within such systems.\"[123] District courts may \ncall upon HEW for assistance in determining whether a school board's performance \nmeasures up to its obligation to desegregate. If school officials in any district \nshould 896*896 find that their district still has segregated faculties and schools or only token \nintegration, their affirmative duty to take corrective action requires them to try an alternative \nto a freedom of choice plan, such as a geographic attendance plan, a combination of the \ntwo, the Princeton plan,[124] or some other acceptable substitute, perhaps aided by an \neducational park. Freedom of choice is not a key that opens all doors to equal educational \nopportunities. \nGiven the knowledge of the educators and administrators in the Office of Education and \ntheir day to day experience with thousands of school systems, judges and school officials \ncan ill afford to turn their backs on the proffer of advice from HEW. Or from any responsible \ngovernment agency or independent group competent to work toward solution of the \ncomplex problem of de jure discrimination bequeathed this generation by ten preceding \ngenerations. \nNow after twelve years of snail's pace progress toward school desegregation, courts are \nentering a new era. The question to be resolved in each case is: How far have formerly de \njure segregated schools progressed in performing their affirmative constitutional duty to \nfurnish equal educational opportunities to all public school children? The clock has ticked \nthe last tick for tokenism and delay in the name of \"deliberate speed\". \n* * * \nIn the suit against the Caddo Parish School Board July 19, 1965, the United States moved \nto intervene under § 902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2). The motion \nwas filed twelve days after the Board submitted its plan in compliance with the district \ncourt's decree of June 14, 1965, but two days before the original plaintiffs filed their \nobjections and before the court issued its order approving the plan. The district court denied \nthe motion on the ground that it came too late. In these circumstances we consider that the \nmotion was timely filed and should have been granted. \nThis Court denied the motion of certain appellants to consolidate their cases, but allowed \nconsolidation of briefs and, in effect, treated the cases as consolidated for purposes of \nappeal. The Court, however, in each case has separately considered the particular \ncontentions of all the parties in the light of the record. \nThe Court reverses the judgments below and remands each case to the district court for \nfurther proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\nCOX, District Judge. \nI reserve the right to dissent in whole or in part at a later date. \nAPPENDIX A: \nPROPOSED DECREE \nIt is ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that the defendants, their agents, officers, \nemployees and successors and all those in active concert and participation with them, be \nand they are permanently enjoined from discriminating on the basis of race or color in the \noperation of the school system. As set out more particularly in the body of the decree, they \nshall take affirmative action to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate the \neffects of past racial discrimination in the operation of the school system: \nI. \nSPEED OF DESEGREGATION \nCommencing with the 1967-68 school year, in accordance with this decree, all grades, \nincluding kindergarten grades, shall be desegregated and pupils assigned to schools in \nthese grades without regard to race or color. \n II. \n897*897\nEXERCISE OF CHOICE \nThe following provisions shall apply to all grades: \n(a) Who May Exercise Choice. A choice of schools may be exercised by a parent or other \nadult person serving as the student's parent. A student may exercise his own choice if he \n(1) is exercising a choice for the ninth or a higher grade, or (2) has reached the age of \nfifteen at the time of the exercise of choice. Such a choice by a student is controlling unless \na different choice is exercised for him by his parent or other adult person serving as his \nparent during the choice period or at such later time as the student exercises a choice. \nEach reference in this decree to a student's exercising a choice means the exercise of the \nchoice, as appropriate, by a parent or such other adult, or by the student himself. \n(b) Annual Exercise of Choice. All students, both white and Negro, shall be required to \nexercise a free choice of schools annually. \n(c) Choice Period. The period for exercising choice shall commence May 1, 1967 and end \nJune 1, 1967, and in subsequent years shall commence March 1 and end March 31 \npreceding the school year for which the choice is to be exercised. No student or prospective \n\nstudent who exercises his choice within the choice period shall be given any preference \nbecause of the time within the period when such choice was exercised. \n(d) Mandatory Exercise of Choice. A failure to exercise a choice within the choice period \nshall not preclude any student from exercising a choice at any time before he commences \nschool for the year with respect to which the choice applies, but such choice may be \nsubordinated to the choices of students who exercised choice before the expiration of the \nchoice period. Any student who has not exercised his choice of school within a week after \nschool opens shall be assigned to the school nearest his home where space is available \nunder standards for determining available space which shall be applied uniformly \nthroughout the system. \n(e) Public Notice. On or within a week before the date the choice period opens, the \ndefendants shall arrange for the conspicuous publication of a notice describing the \nprovisions of this decree in the newspaper most generally circulated in the community. The \ntext of the notice shall be substantially similar to the text of the explanatory letter sent home \nto parents. (See paragraph II(e).) Publication as a legal notice will not be sufficient. Copies \nof this notice must also be given at that time to all radio and television stations serving the \ncommunity. Copies of this decree shall be posted in each school in the school system and \nat the office of the Superintendent of Education. \n(f) Mailing of Explanatory Letters and Choice Forms. On the first day of the choice period \nthere shall be distributed by first-class mail an explanatory letter and a choice form to the \nparent (or other adult person acting as parent, if known to the defendants) of each student, \ntogether with a return envelope addressed to the Superintendent. Should the defendants \nsatisfactorily demonstrate to the court that they are unable to comply with the requirement \nof distributing the explanatory letter and choice form by first-class mail, they shall propose \nan alternative method which will maximize individual notice, i. e., personal notice to parents \nby delivery to the pupil with adequate procedures to insure the delivery of the notice. The \ntext for the explanatory letter and choice form shall essentially conform to the sample letter \nand choice form appended to this decree. \n(g) Extra Copies of the Explanatory Letter and Choice Form. Extra copies of the explanatory \nletter and choice form shall be freely available to parents, students, prospective students, \nand the general public at each school in the system and at the office of the Superintendent \nof Education during the times of the year when such schools are usually open. \n(h) Content of Choice Form. Each choice form shall set forth the name and 898*898location \nof the grades offered at each school and may require of the person exercising the choice \nthe name, address, age of student, school and grade currently or most recently attended by \nthe student, the school chosen, the signature of one parent or other adult person serving as \nparent, or where appropriate the signature of the student, and the identity of the person \nsigning. No statement of reasons for a particular choice, or any other information, or any \nwitness or other authentication, may be required or requested, without approval of the court. \n(i) Return of Choice Form. At the option of the person completing the choice form, the \nchoice may be returned by mail, in person, or by messenger to any school in the school \nsystem or to the office of the Superintendent. \n\n(j) Choices not on Official Form. The exercise of choice may also be made by the \nsubmission in like manner of any other writing which contains information sufficient to \nidentify the student and indicates that he has made a choice of school. \n(k) Choice Forms Binding. When a choice form has once been submitted and the choice \nperiod has expired, the choice is binding for the entire school year and may not be changed \nexcept in cases of parents making different choices from their children under the conditions \nset forth in paragraph II(a) of this decree and in exceptional cases where, absent the \nconsideration of race, a change is educationally called for or where compelling hardship is \nshown by the student. \n(l) Preference in Assignment. In assigning students to schools, no preferences shall be \ngiven to any student for prior attendance at a school and, except with the approval of court \nin extraordinary circumstances, no choice shall be denied for any reason other than \novercrowding. In case of overcrowding at any school, preference shall be given on the basis \nof the proximity of the school to the homes of the students choosing it, without regard to \nrace or color. Standards for determining overcrowding shall be applied uniformly throughout \nthe system. \n(m) Second Choice where First Choice is Denied. Any student whose choice is denied must \nbe promptly notified in writing and given his choice of any school in the school system \nserving his grade level where space is available. The student shall have seven days from \nthe receipt of notice of a denial of first choice in which to exercise a second choice. \n(n) Transportation. Where transportation is generally provided, buses must be routed to the \nmaximum extent feasible in light of the geographic distribution of students, so as to serve \neach student choosing any school in the system. Every student choosing either the formerly \nwhite or the formerly Negro school nearest his residence must be transported to the school \nto which he is assigned under these provisions, whether or not it is his first choice, if that \nschool is sufficiently distant from his home to make him eligible for transportation under \ngenerally applicable transportation rules. \n(o) Officials not to Influence Choice. At no time shall any official, teacher, or employee of the \nschool system influence any parent, or other adult person serving as a parent, or any \nstudent, in the exercise of a choice or favor or penalize any person because of a choice \nmade. If the defendant school board employs professional guidance counselors, such \npersons shall base their guidance and counselling on the individual student's particular \npersonal, academic, and vocational needs. Such guidance and counselling by teachers as \nwell as professional guidance counsellors shall be available to all students without regard to \nrace or color. \n(p) Protection of Persons Exercising Choice. Within their authority school officials are \nresponsible for the protection of persons exercising rights under or otherwise affected by \nthis decree. They shall, without delay, take appropriate action with regard to any student or \nstaff member who interferes with the successful operation of the plan. Such interference \nshall include harassment, intimidation, threats, hostile words or acts, and similar behavior. \nThe school board shall not publish, allow, or cause to be 899*899 published, the names or \naddresses of pupils exercising rights or otherwise affected by this decree. If officials of the \n\nschool system are not able to provide sufficient protection, they shall seek whatever \nassistance is necessary from other appropriate officials. \nIII. \nPROSPECTIVE STUDENTS \nEach prospective new student shall be required to exercise a choice of schools before or at \nthe time of enrollment. All such students known to defendants shall be furnished a copy of \nthe prescribed letter to parents, and choice form, by mail or in person, on the date the \nchoice period opens or as soon thereafter as the school system learns that he plans to \nenroll. Where there is no pre-registration procedure for newly entering students, copies of \nthe choice forms shall be available at the Office of the Superintendent and at each school \nduring the time the school is usually open. \nIV. \nTRANSFERS \n(a) Transfers for Students. Any student shall have the right at the beginning of a new term, \nto transfer to any school from which he was excluded or would otherwise be excluded on \naccount of his race or color. \n(b) Transfers for Special Needs. Any student who requires a course of study not offered at \nthe school to which he has been assigned may be permitted, upon his written application, at \nthe beginning of any school term or semester, to transfer to another school which offers \ncourses for his special needs. \n(c) Transfers to Special Classes or Schools. If the defendants operate and maintain special \nclasses or schools for physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or gifted children, the \ndefendants may assign children to such schools or classes on a basis related to the \nfunction of the special class or school that is other than freedom of choice. In no event shall \nsuch assignments be made on the basis of race or color or in a manner which tends to \nperpetuate a dual school system based on race or color. \nV. \nSERVICES, FACILITIES, ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS \nNo student shall be segregated or discriminated against on account of race or color in any \nservice, facility, activity, or program (including transportation, athletics, or other \nextracurricular activity) that may be conducted or sponsored by or affiliated with the school \nin which he is enrolled. A student attending school for the first time on a desegregated basis \nmay not be subject to any disqualification or waiting period for participation in activities and \nprograms, including athletics, which might otherwise apply because he is a transfer or newly \n\nassigned student except that such transferees shall be subject to long-standing, non-racially \nbased rules of city, county, or state athletic associations dealing with the eligibility of \ntransfer students for athletic contests. All school use or school-sponsored use of athletic \nfields, meeting rooms, and all other school related services, facilities, activities, and \nprograms such as Commencement exercises and parent-teacher meetings which are open \nto persons other than enrolled students, shall be open to all persons without regard to race \nor color. All special educational programs conducted by the defendants shall be conducted \nwithout regard to race or color. \nVI. \nSCHOOL EQUALIZATION \n(a) Inferior Schools. In schools heretofore maintained for Negro students, the defendants \nshall take prompt steps necessary to provide physical facilities, equipment, courses of \ninstruction, and instructional materials of quality equal to that provided in schools previously \nmaintained for white students. Conditions of overcrowding, as determined by pupil-teacher \nratios and pupil-classroom ratios shall, to the extent feasible, be distributed evenly between \nschools formerly 900*900maintained for Negro students and those formerly maintained for \nwhite students. If for any reason it is not feasible to improve sufficiently any school formerly \nmaintained for Negro students, where such improvement would otherwise be required by \nthis subparagraph, such school shall be closed as soon as possible, and students enrolled \nin the school shall be reassigned on the basis of freedom of choice. By October of each \nyear, defendants shall report to the Clerk of the Court pupil-teacher ratios, pupil-classroom \nratios, and per-pupil expenditures both as to operating and capital improvement costs, and \nshall outline the steps to be taken and the time within which they shall accomplish the \nequalization of such schools. \n(b) Remedial Programs. The defendants shall provide remedial education programs which \npermit students attending or who have previously attended all-Negro schools to overcome \npast inadequacies in their education. \nVII. \nNEW CONSTRUCTION \nThe defendants, to the extent consistent with the proper operation of the school system as a \nwhole, shall locate any new school and substantially expand any existing schools with the \nobjective of eradicating the vestiges of the dual system and of eliminating the effects of \nsegregation. \nVIII. \nFACULTY AND STAFF \n\n(a) Faculty Employment. Race or color shall not be a factor in the hiring, assignment, \nreassignment, promotion, demotion, or dismissal of teachers and other professional staff \nmembers, including student teachers, except that race may be taken into account for the \npurpose of counteracting or correcting the effect of the segregated assignment of teachers \nin the dual system. Teachers, principals, and staff members shall be assigned to schools so \nthat the faculty and staff is not composed exclusively of members of one race. Wherever \npossible, teachers shall be assigned so that more than one teacher of the minority race \n(white or Negro) shall be on a desegregated faculty. Defendants shall take positive and \naffirmative steps to accomplish the desegregation of their school faculties and to achieve \nsubstantial desegregation of faculties in as many of the schools as possible for the 1967-68 \nschool year notwithstanding that teacher contracts for the 1966-67 or 1967-68 school years \nmay have already been signed and approved. The tenure of teachers in the system shall \nnot be used as an excuse for failure to comply with this provision. The defendants shall \nestablish as an objective that the pattern of teacher assignment to any particular school not \nbe identifiable as tailored for a heavy concentration of either Negro or white pupils in the \nschool. \n(b) Dismissals. Teachers and other professional staff members may not be discriminatorily \nassigned, dismissed, demoted, or passed over for retention, promotion, or rehiring, on the \nground of race or color. In any instance where one or more teachers or other professional \nstaff members are to be displaced as a result of desegregation, no staff vacancy in the \nschool system shall be filled through recruitment from outside the system unless no such \ndisplaced staff member is qualified to fill the vacancy. If, as a result of desegregation, there \nis to be a reduction in the total professional staff of the school system, the qualifications of \nall staff members in the system shall be evaluated in selecting the staff member to be \nreleased without consideration of race or color. A report containing any ants shall take steps \nto assign and reasons therefor, shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court, serving copies \nupon opposing counsel, within five (5) days after such dismissal, demotion, etc., as \nproposed. \n(c) Past Assignments. The defendants shall take steps to assign and reassign teachers and \nother professional staff members to eliminate past discriminatory patterns. \n IX. \n901*901\nREPORTS TO THE COURT \n(1) Report on Choice Period. The defendants shall serve upon the opposing parties and file \nwith the Clerk of the Court on or before April 15, 1967, and on or before June 15, 1967, and \nin each subsequent year on or before June 1, a report tabulating by race the number of \nchoice applications and transfer applications received for enrollment in each grade in each \nschool in the system, and the number of choices and transfers granted and the number of \ndenials in each grade of each school. The report shall also state any reasons relied upon in \ndenying choice and shall tabulate, by school and by race of student, the number of choices \nand transfers denied for each such reason. \n\nIn addition, the report shall show the percentage of pupils actually transferred or assigned \nfrom segregated grades or to schools attended predominantly by pupils of a race other than \nthe race of the applicant, for attendance during the 1966-67 school year, with comparable \ndata for the 1965-66 school year.

Any student who will be \nentering one of these grades next year may choose to attend any school in our system, \nregardless of whether that school was formerly all-white or all-Negro. It does not matter \nwhich school your child is attending this year. You and your child may select any school you \nwish. \nEvery student, white and Negro, must make a choice of schools. If a child is entering the \nninth or higher grade, or if the child is fifteen years old or older, he may make the choice \nhimself. Otherwise a parent or other adult serving as parent must sign the choice form. A \nchild enrolling in the school system for the first time must make a choice of schools before \nor at the time of his enrollment. \nThe form on which the choice should be made is attached to this letter. It should be \ncompleted and returned by June 1, 1967. You may mail it in the enclosed envelope, or \ndeliver it by messenger or by hand to any school principal or to the Office of the \n\nSuperintendent at any time between May 1 and June 1. No one may require you to return \nyour choice form before June 1 and no preference is given for returning the choice form \nearly. \n902*902 No principal, teacher or other school official is permitted to influence anyone in \nmaking a choice or to require early return of the choice form. No one is permitted to favor or \npenalize any student or other person because of a choice made. A choice once made \ncannot be changed except for serious hardship. \nNo child will be denied his choice unless for reasons of overcrowding at the school chosen, \nin which case children living nearest the school will have preference. \nTransportation will be provided, if reasonably possible, no matter what school is chosen. \n[Delete if the school system does not provide transportation.] \nYour School Board and the school staff will do everything we can to see to it that the rights \nof all students are protected and that desegregation of our schools is carried out \nsuccessfully. \nSincerely yours, Superintendent. \nCHOICE FORM \nThis form is provided for you to choose a school for your child to attend next year. You have \n30 days to make your choice. It does not matter which school your child attended last year, \nand does not matter whether the school you choose was formerly a white or Negro school. \nThis form must be mailed or brought to the principal of any school in the system or to the \noffice of the Superintendent, [address], by June 1, 1967. A choice is required for each child. \n  Name of child \n......................................................                            \n(Last)       (First)     (Middle)    Address \n............................................................    \nName of Parent or other   adult serving as parent \n............................................

But only the Southern states \nshowed a changed attitude toward reporting records by race; in only three Southern states \ncould nearly complete statistics be obtained district by district. As in other years, three of the \nborder states plus the District of Columbia continued to keep records by race, and three \nstates did not. \nCorrespondents for Southern Education Reporting Service * * * found that 15.89 per cent of \nthe Negroes enrolled in the public schools of the region attended classes with whites, \nmostly in formerly all-white schools but sometimes also in formerly all-Negro schools. This \nnumbered 567,789 Negro students out of the region's Negro enrollment of 3,572,810. \nIn the first 10 years after the Supreme Court decisions on segregated schools, in 1954 and \n1955, the Southern and border region increased the number of Negroes in schools with \nwhites at an average of about one per cent a year. Although the impetus of the Supreme \nCourt's rulings and the possibility of direct involvement in legal action were factors, most \ndistricts desegregating through last year acted \"voluntarily\" and only about 10 per cent \nrequired a specific court order. By the end of the 1964-65 school year, the region had \nenrolled 10.9 per cent of its Negro students in biracial classrooms. \nThe 1964 Civil Rights Act brought pressure on every district in the nation but the \ncompliance effort admittedly was concentrated on the South. * * * Beginning in the spring of \n1965 and continuing even through the first months of the 1965-66 school year, HEW's \nOffice of Education negotiated with officials in each district to obtain compliance by the \nschool officials either signing a statement, submitting a court-ordered desegregation plan or \nadopting a voluntary plan. \nWith the new school year, the region had increased the number of Negroes in desegregated \nschools by five percentage points to reach 15.9 per cent, while in the previous two school \nyears the rate of increase in this figure had only been between one and two percentage \npoints. For 1964-65, the region had 10.9 per cent of the Negro enrollment in desegregated \nschools, an increase of 1.7 percentage points over 1963-64, and for that year the 9.2 per \ncent figure was an increase of 1.2 percentage points over 1962-63. (See Table I.) * * * \n                             TABLE I                         The \nRate of Change            Percentage of Negroes in Schools with \n\nWhites                             %                 %                 \n%   School Year   South   Change   Border   Change   Region   \nChange   1959-60[*]       .160             45.4               6.4   \n1960-61        .162     .002    49.0      3.6      7.0       .6   \n1961-62        .241     .079    52.5      3.5      7.6       .6   \n1962-63        .453     .212    51.8      0.7      8.0       .4   \n1963-64       1.17      .717    54.8      3.0      9.2      1.2   \n1964-65       2.25     1.08     58.3      3.5     10.9      1.7   \n1965-66       6.01     3.76     68.9     10.6     15.9      5.0  \n904*904 Up through the 1962-63 school year, the 11 Southern states together had fewer \nthan one per cent of their Negro students in schools with whites. In 1963-64, the figure \npassed the one per cent mark and it almost doubled for 1964-65 to become 2.25 per cent of \nthe Negroes in biracial schools, an increase of more than one percentage point. For the \n1965-66 school year, the percentage more than doubled and reached 6.01 per cent.[1] \nThe six border states and the District of Columbia desegregated at a faster rate than did the \nSouth, and by the 1961-62 school year that area had more than half of its Negro enrollment \nattending desegregated schools. The annual change in the number of Negroes in \ndesegregated border schools averaged about three per cent a year, and by 1964-65, the \nborder area had desegregated 58.3 per cent of its Negro enrollment. In the current school \nyear, the border area has 68.9 per cent of its Negro students attending the same schools \nwith whites, a jump of over 10 percentage points from the previous year's figure. \nThis year, as in previous years, a disparity exists between what might be called \"technical\" \ndesegregation and \"actual\" desegregation. Last year, for example 56 per cent of the \nregion's Negro students were enrolled in districts having desegregation policies, but about \n11 per cent of the total Negro enrollment attended desegregated schools. This year, the \nregion has 97 per cent of its districts in official compliance with federal desegregation \nregulations, and 93 per cent of the region's combined Negro and white enrollment comes \nfrom these districts. However, the actual attendance of Negroes in desegregated schools \namounts to almost 16 per cent. The difference in these figures was accentuated this year by \nthe fact that almost 2,000 school districts having either all-white or all-Negro enrollments are \nincluded in the \"in compliance\" statistics. * * * \nAmong the Southern states, Texas leads in the number and percentage of Negroes in \nschools with whites — an estimated 60,000 Negroes or 17 per cent of the state's Negro \nenrollment. Tennessee ranks second in the area with 16 per cent and Virginia third with 11 \nper cent. Three states — Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi — continue to have less than \none per cent of their Negro enrollment attending schools with whites. The other Southern \nstates — Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina — vary between 1 \nand 10 per cent of their Negro students in biracial classrooms. \nAll but one of the border states have more than half of their Negro enrollments in \ndesegregated schools. Oklahoma has 38 per cent of its Negroes in biracial schools, \nMaryland has 56 per cent, and Delaware, the District of Columbia, Kentucky, * * * Missouri \nand West Virginia have desegregated more than three-fourths of their Negro student \npopulation. * * * \n\nThe desegregation statistic showing the sharpest increase this year was the 905*905number \nof districts with desegregation policies. The region now has 4,804 public school districts that \nhave received approval from the U. S. Office of Education for their desegregation proposals. \nWhen the last school year ended, SERS reported that 1,476 districts had desegregated in \npractice or in policy. \n                                            TABLE III                                       \nStatus of Desegregation                          (17 Southern and \nBorder States and D.C.)

Elliott, 132 F.Supp. 776. \nThe majority now seeks to criticize the Briggs case and disparage it as dictum, although this \nCourt in several reported decisions has embraced and adopted Briggs with extensive \nquotations from it as the decisional law of this Circuit. Surely, only two of the judges of this \nCourt may not now single-handedly reverse those decisions and change such law of this \nCircuit. \nThese school cases all stem from the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in \nthe familiar Brown 906*906 cases.[1] Nothing was said in those cases or has since been said \nby the Supreme Court to justify or support the extremely harsh plan of enforced integration \ndevised by the majority decision. Significantly, there is nothing in the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 to suggest the propriety of this Court adopting and following any guidelines of the \nHealth, Education and Welfare Commissioner in these school desegregation cases in such \nrespect. The policy statement of Congress as contained in the act itself expressly disclaims \nany intention or purpose to do that which these guidelines, and the majority opinion \napproving them, do in complete disregard thereof. \nNo informed person at this late date would now argue with the soundness of the philosophy \nof the Brown decision. That case simply declared the constitutional right of negro children to \nattend public schools of their own free choice without any kind of restraint by state action. \nThat Court has made it clear that the time for \"deliberate\" speed in desegregating these \npublic schools has now expired, but the majority opinion herein is the first to say that \nthe Brown case, together with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, makes it necessary that these \npublic schools must now integrate and mix these schools and their facilities, \"lock, stock \nand barrel.\" That view comes as a strange construction of the Fourteenth Amendment rights \nof colored children. The passage of time since the rendition of the Brown case; and of \nnatural disparities which are found in so many school plans before the Court; and the \ndifficult problems posed before the Court by such plans certainly can provide no legal \njustification or basis for this extreme view and harsh and mailed fist decision at this time. \nThese questions involving principles of common sense and law are readily resolved by a \ncourt of equity without being properly accused of giving an advisory opinion. The decision in \nsuch case is not overtaxing on a court of equity and its articulated conclusions can be \nimplemented by an enforceable decree even at the expenditure of some well spent time, \npatience and energy of the Court. If a Court is to write a decree, it should be the decree of \nthat Court and not the by-product of some administrative agency without knowledge or \nsworn obligation to resolve sacred constitutional rights and principles. Unilaterally prepared \nguidelines allegedly devised by the Commissioner may or not accord with his own views, \nbut such an anomalously prepared document could not justify this Court in adopting it \"lock, \n\nstock and barrel\" under any pretext and even with repeated disavowals of such intention or \npurpose. \nThe Constitution of the United States is not the dead hand of the past strangling the liberties \nof a free people; it is a living document designed for all time to perpetuate liberty, freedom \nand justice for every person, young or old, who is born under or who comes within its \nprotecting shield. As was said many years ago, \"in moving water there is life, in still waters \nthere is stagnation and death.\" The Constitution was framed not for one era, but for all time. \nBut when the Courts transform viability into elasticity, constitutional rights are illusory. The \nrope of liberty may be twisted and become a garrote which strangles those who seek its \nprotection. If the majority opinion in these cases is permitted to stand, it will, in the name of \nprotecting civil rights of some, destroy civil rights and constitutional liberties of all our \ncitizens, their children and their children's children. \n907*907 The Supreme Court, in Brown II, said that \"[s]chool authorities have the primary \nresponsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems; courts will have to \nconsider whether the action of school authorities constitutes good faith implementation of \nthe governing constitutional principles.\" It thereupon became the duty of the Court, acting as \na Court of Equity, under such principles to see that public schools, still operating under the \ndual system by state action, were desegregated (not integrated) in accordance with the \nvested constitutional right of colored children. Judicial haste and impatience cannot justify \nthis Court in equating integration with desegregation. No Court up to this time has been \nheard to say that this Court now has the power and the authority to force integration of both \nraces upon these public schools without regard to any equitable considerations, or the will \nor wish of either race. The decisions of this Court deserve and must have stability and \nintegrity. It was the 1965 guidelines of HEW that were approved by this Court in Jerome \nDerek Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 355 F.2d 865. Judge \nWisdom wrote for the Court and Judge Thornberry concurred in that case on January 26, \n1966; and there was not a word in that case to the effect that this Court then thought that \nany decision or statute or guidelines under any statute required or justified forced \nintegration. Almost before that slip opinion reached the bound volume, this Court has now \nwritten on December 29, 1966, a vastly different opinion with no change intervening in the \nlaw. \nThe last reported school case from this Circuit, decided August 16, 1966 by Judge Tuttle \nand Judge Thornberry in Birdie Mae Davis, et al. v. Board of School Commissioners of \nMobile County, et al., 364 F.2d 896, this Court still wrote of accelerating a plan \nof desegregation. As if to foreshadow the point of Judge Wisdom's \"nettle\" in the majority \nopinion in this case, Judge Tuttle wrote in his Note 1 an explanation of his changing \nrequirements in these school cases for the delayed enjoyment of constitutional rights by \naccelerating desegregation. Davis said that negro children, as individuals, had the right to \ntransfer to schools from which they were excluded because of their race, and said that this \nhad been the law since the Brown decision; but that misunderstanding of that principle was \nperhaps due to the popularity \"of an oversimplified dictum that the constitution `does not \nrequire integration' [Briggs v. Elliott, E.D.S.C.1955, 132 F.Supp. 776, 777].\" That is the first \nand only expressed criticism of Briggs found among the decisions of this Circuit, but the \nCourt did not comment upon the viability and soundness of the many decisions of this \nCircuit which wholeheartedly embraced and repeatedly reaffirmed the so-called dicta \n\nin Briggs. Davis dealt with an urban area in Mobile, Alabama, while these cases deal with \nsmall communities or rural schools but that could have no possible bearing on \ndesegregation versus or as distinguished from immediate forced integration or mixing of \nthese schools. \nIn Alfred Avery, Jr., a Minor by his Mother and Next Friend, Mrs. Alfred Avery, et al. v. \nWichita Independent School District, et al., 241 F.2d 230 (1957), this Court said: \n\"The Constitution as construed in the School Segregation Cases, Brown v. Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873; Id., 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 \nL.Ed. 1083, and Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884, forbids any \nstate action requiring segregation of children in public schools solely on account of race; it \ndoes not, however, require actual integration of the races. As was well said in Briggs v. \nElliott, D.C.E.D.S.C., 132 F.Supp. 776, 777: \n\"* * * it is important that we point out exactly what the Supreme Court has decided and what \nit has not decided in this case. It has not decided that the federal courts are to take over or \nregulate the public schools of the states. It has not decided that the states must mix persons \nof different races in the schools or must require them to attend schools or 908*908 must \ndeprive them of the right of choosing the schools they attend. What it has decided, and all \nthat it has decided, is that a state may not deny to any person on account of race the right \nto attend any school that it maintains. This, under the decision of the Supreme Court, the \nstate may not do directly or indirectly; but if the schools which it maintains are open to \nchildren of all races, no violation of the Constitution is involved even though the children of \ndifferent races voluntarily attend different schools, as they attend different churches. \nNothing in the Constitution or in the decision of the Supreme Court takes away from the \npeople freedom to choose the schools they attend. The Constitution, in other words, does \nnot require integration. It merely forbids discrimination. It does not forbid such segregation \nas occurs as the result of voluntary action. It merely forbids the use of governmental power \nto enforce segregation. The Fourteenth Amendment is a limitation upon the exercise of \npower by the state or state agencies, not a limitation upon the freedom of individuals.\" \nAgain, this Court in Hilda Ruth Borders, a Minor, et al. v. Dr. Edwin L. Rippy, et al., 247 F.2d \n268 (1957) said: \"The equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth \namendment do not affirmatively command integration, but they do forbid any state action \nrequiring segregation on account of their race or color of children in the public \nschools. Avery v. Wichita Falls Independent School District, 5 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 230, 233. \nPupils may, of course, be separated according to their degree of advancement or \nretardation, their ability to learn, on account of their health, or for any other legitimate \nreason, but each child is entitled to be treated as an individual without regard to his race or \ncolor.\" \nIn a public housing case, participated in by Judge Wisdom, Queen Cohen v. Public Housing \nAdministration, 5 Cir., 257 F.2d 73, it is said: \"Neither the Fifth nor the Fourteenth \nAmendment operates positively to command integration of the races, but only negatively to \nforbid governmentally enforced segregation.\" \n\nThis Court in Sandra Craig Boson, et al. v. Dr. Edwin L. Rippy, et al., 285 F.2d 43, said: \n\"Indeed, this Court has adopted the reasoning in Briggs v. Elliott, D.C. E.D.S.C.1955, 132 \nF.Supp. 776, relied on by the Sixth Circuit, and has further said: `The equal protection and \ndue process clauses of the fourteenth amendment do not affirmatively command \nintegration, but they do forbid any state action requiring segregation on account of their race \nor color of children in the public schools. Avery v. Wichita Falls Independent School District, \n5 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 230, 233. Pupils may, of course, be separated according to their \ndegree of advancement or retardation, their ability to learn, on account of their health, or for \nany other legitimate reason, but each child is entitled to be treated as an individual without \nregard to his race or color.' Borders v. Rippy, 5 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 268, 271. \n\"Nevertheless, with deference to the views of the Sixth Circuit, it seems to us that \nclassification according to race for purposes of transfer is hardly less unconstitutional than \nsuch classification for purposes of original assignment to a public school.\" It is that decision \nin Briggs v. Elliott, supra, which the majority here now seek to criticize and repudiate. \nIn Ralph Stell, et al. v. Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education, et al. (5 CA) 333 \nF.2d 55, 59, in footnote 2 it is said: \"No court has required a `compulsory racially integrated \nschool system' to meet the constitutional mandate that there be no discrimination on the \nbasis of race in the operation of public schools. See Evers v. Jackson Municipal Separate \nSchool District, 5 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 408, and cases there cited. The interdiction is against \nenforced racial segregation. Incidental integration, of course, occurs through the process of \ndesegregation. Cf. Stone v. Board of Education of Atlanta, 5 Cir., 1962, 309 F.2d 638.\" \nThis Court in Darrell Kenyatta Evers, et al. v. Jackson Municipal Separate 909*909School \nDistrict, 328 F.2d 408 (1964) said: \"This is not to say that the Fourteenth Amendment \ncommands integration of the races in the schools, or that voluntary segregation is not \nlegally permissible. See Avery v. Wichita Falls Ind. School Dist., 5 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d \n230; Rippy v. Borders, 5 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 690; Cohen v. Public Housing Administration, \n5 Cir., 1958, 257 F.2d 73, cert. den., 358 U.S. 928, 79 S.Ct. 315, 3 L.Ed.2d 302; Holland v. \nBoard of Public Instruction, supra; and Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham Board of Education, \nsupra. The Supreme Court did not hold otherwise in Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, \n347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873.\" The same teaching is expressed in a park case \nfrom this Court, styled City of Montgomery, Alabama v. Georgia Theresa Gilmore, 277 F.2d \n364. In the many cases from this Court involving the race issue in public schools (there \nbeing some forty-one of them according to the majority opinion), not one of them speaks of \nany requirement or duty of the school to forcefully integrate the races, or to compel the \nraces to mix with each other in public schools; but every one of them speak \nof desegregating such schools. The word desegregate does not appear in Webster's New \nInternational Dictionary, Second Edition, Edited in 1950. But Webster's New Collegiate \nDictionary (a Merriam-Webster) defines desegregation as: \"To free itself of any law, \nprovision or practice requiring isolation of the members of a particular race in separate \nunits, especially in military service or in education.\" \nIn sum, there is no law to require one of these public schools to integrate or force mix these \nraces in public schools. But these public schools, which have been heretofore segregated \nby state action, and operate under a dual system, should be required to remove every \nvestige of state influence toward segregation of the races in these schools; and these \n\ncolored children should be fully advised of their constitutional right to attend public schools \nof their choice, completely without regard to race. Many problems exist and are created by \nthe proper enforcement of desegregation plans that will assure a full sweep of real freedom \nof choice to these negro children, and this Court cannot by only two of its members become \nimpatient as trail-blazers and rewrite the decisional law of this Circuit as my good friends \nhave undertaken to do in this case. \nSuch a course would do violence to the ancient rule of Stare Decisis. In Donnelly Garment \nCo. v. National Labor Relations Board, (8 CCA) 123 F.2d 215: \"It is a long-established rule \nthat judges of the same court will not knowingly review, reverse or overrule each other's \ndecisions. Shreve v. Cheesman, 8 Cir., 69 F. 785, 790, 791; Plattner Implement Co. v. \nInternational Harvester Co., 8 Cir., 133 F. 376, 378, 379. The necessity of such a rule in the \ninterest of an orderly administration of justice is clear.\" In Sanford Napoleon Powell v. \nUnited States, (7 CA) 338 F.2d 556 (1964), it is said: \"Our decision in Lauer has been \ncriticized. However, this decision is the law of this Circuit unless and until this Court \n(presumably sitting en banc) would determine otherwise or unless higher authority might so \ndetermine.\" \nRule 25a of the Fifth Circuit provides for a rehearing in any case upon vote of a majority of \nthe circuit judges in active service for any reason which appears to them to be sufficient in \nthe particular case. Ordinarily, a hearing or rehearing en banc is not ordered except \"when \nnecessary to secure or maintain uniformity or continuity in the decisions of the Court, [etc.]\" \nThe majority opinion simply does not reflect the well considered and firmly stated composite \ndecision of this Circuit; and in that view, is not an accurate or proper statement of the law in \nthis case as it now exists in the Fifth Circuit. \nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S. C., 1958 ed., § 2000c-6) refers to \"desegregation in \npublic education\" and not to forced mixing or integration of the races. That same section \nstates \"provided that nothing herein shall empower any official or court of the United States \nto issue any order seeking to achieve a 910*910racial balance in any school by requiring the \ntransportation of pupils or students from one school to another or one school district to \nanother in order to achieve such racial balance, or otherwise enlarge the existing power of \nthe court to insure compliance with constitutional standards.\" The English language simply \ncould not be summoned to state any more clearly than does that very positive enactment of \nCongress, that these so-called \"guidelines\" of this administrative agency are not sacrosanct \nexpositions of school law (if so intended), but are actually promulgated and being used in \nopposition to and in violation of this positive statute. Contrary to the majority opinion, it was \nnever the intention or purpose of the Congress to constitute the Commissioner of Health, \nEducation and Welfare as the sidewalk superintendent of this Court in these school cases. \nOn the contrary, 42 U.S.C., 1958 ed., § 2000c-2 provides that the Commissioner, only upon \napplication of a school board, state, municipality, school district or other governmental \nunit, can render any technical assistance to such an applicant. Nowhere in that act is it \ncontemplated that this court should abdicate its power and authority to act upon and decide \na case on appeal to it as a court of equity, and simply decide it by rubber stamping one of \nthe annual guideline bulletins of an administrative bureau of the United States in \nWashington. The attitude and position of this Court in doing exactly that in this case is not \nimproved by disavowing any intention or purpose to do so. \n\nThere were seven consolidated cases before the Court which are embraced in this decision. \nMost, if not all, of the plans in those cases were defective and needed updating for a more \nrealistic and effective application of the free choice principle under the former decisions of \nthis Court; but they did not need or deserve the harsh and unprecedented treatment \naccorded these schools by the majority decision in these cases. The colored children are \nnot befriended and their lot is not improved by this unprecedented majority opinion and the \nentire school system will suffer under the impact of this improvident administrative directive \nas thus adopted by this Court. \nMy duty impels me to file this dissent to the majority view in these cases with great \ndeference to both of my distinguished associates. \n[*] William Harold Cox, U. S. District Judge for the Southern District of Mississippi, sitting by designation. \n[1] Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (Brown I). See Brown v.

See Appendix B, Rate of Change and Status of \nDesegregation. In each of the seven cases before this Court, no start was made toward desegregation of the schools \nuntil 1965, eleven years after Brown. In all these cases, the start was a consequence of a court order obtained only \nafter vigorous opposition by school officials. \n[4] Braxton v. Board of Public Instruction of Duval County, S.D.Fla.1962, 7 Race Rel. L.Rep. 675, aff'd, 5 Cir. 1964, \n326 F.2d 616, cert. den'd 377 U.S. 924, 84 S.Ct. 1223, 12 L.Ed.2d 216 (1964). Senator Humphrey cited this case in \nexplaining Section 604 of The Civil Rights Act of 1964. See Section IV D of this opinion. \n[5] The mystique that has developed over the supposed difference between \"desegregation\" and \"integration\" \noriginated in Briggs v. Elliott, E.D.S.C.1955, 132 F. Supp. 776: \"The Constitution * * * does not require integration. It \nmerely forbids [segregation]\". 132 F.Supp. at 777. This dictum is a product of the narrow view that Fourteenth \nAmendment rights are only individual rights; that therefore Negro school children individually must exhaust their \nadministrative remedies and will not be allowed to bring class action suits to desegregate a school system. See \nSection III A of this opinion. \nThe Supreme Court did not use either term, \"desegregation\" or \"integration\", in Brown. But the Court did quote with \napproval a statement of the district court in which \"integrated\" was used as we use it here. For ten years \nafter Brown the Court refrained from using the terms \"integration\" or \"integrated\". Then in 1964 in Griffin v. County \nSchool Board of Prince Edward County, 375 U.S. 391, 84 S.Ct. 400, 11 L.Ed.2d 409, the Court noted that \"the Board \nof Supervisors decided not to levy taxes or appropriate funds for integrated public schools\", i. e. schools \nschools under a desegregtaion order. There is not one Supreme Court decision which can be fairly construed to show \nthat the Court distinguished \"desegregation\" from \"integration\", in terms or by even the most gossamer implication. \nCounsel for the Alabama defendants assert that \"desegregation\" and \"integration\" are terms of art. They struggle \nvaliantly to define these words: \nBy \"desegregation\" we mean the duty imposed by Brown upon schools which previously compelled segregation to \ntake affirmative steps to eliminate such compulsory segregation so as to allow the admission of students to schools \non a non-racial admission basis. By \"in-integration\" we mean the actual placing of or attendance by Negro students in \nschools with whites. \n\nThey can do so only by narrowing the definitions to the point of inadequacy. Manifestly, the duty to desegregate \nschools extends beyond the mere \"admission\" of Negro students on a non-racial basis. As for \"integration\", \nmanifestly a desegregation plan must include some arrangement for the attendance of Negroes in formerly white \nschools. \nIn this opinion we use the words \"integration\" and \"desegregation\" interchangeably. That is the way they are used in \nthe vernacular. That is the way they are defined in Webster's Third New International Dictionary: \"`integrate' to \n`desegregate'\". The Civil Rights Commission follows this usage: for example, \"The Office of Education * * * standards \n* * * should * * * ensure that free choice plans are adequate to disestablish dual, racially segregated school systems * \n* * to achieve substantial integration in such systems.\" U. S. Comm. on Civil Rights, Survey of School Desegregation \n1965-66, p. 54. \nThe Eighth Circuit used \"integration\" interchangeably with \"desegregation\" in Smith v. Board of Education of \nMorrilton, 8 Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 770. So did the Third Circuit in Evans v. Ennis, 3 Cir. 1960, 281 F.2d 385. See \nalso Brown v. County School Board of Frederick County, Va., W.D.Va.1965, 245 F.Supp. 549. The courts in Dowell v. \nSchool Board of Oklahoma City Public Schools, W.D.Okl. 1965, 244 F.Supp. 971, aff'd, 10 Cir. Jan. 23, 1967, 375 \nF.2d 158 and Dove v. Parham, 8 Cir. 1960, 282 F.2d 256 (and the Civil Rights Commission), speak of a school \nboard's duty to \"disestablish segregation\". This term accurately \"implies that existing racial imbalance is a \nconsequence of past segregation policies, and, because of this, school boards have an affirmative duty to remedy \nracial imbalance\". Note, Discrimination in the Hiring and Assignment of Teachers in Public School Systems, 64 \nMich.L.Rev. 692, 698 n. 44 (1966). (Emphasis added.) \nWe use the terms \"integregation\" and \"desegregation\" of formerly segregated public schools to mean the conversion \nof a de jure segregated dual system to a unitary, nonracial (nondiscriminatory) system — lock, stock, and barrel: \nstudents, faculty, staff, facilities, programs, and activities. The proper governmental objective of the conversion is to \noffer educational opportunities on equal terms to all. \nAs we see it, the law imposes an absolute duty to desegregate, that is, disestablish segregation. And an absolute \nduty to integrate, in the sense that a disproportionate concentration of Negroes in certain schools cannot be ignored; \nracial mixing of students is a high priority educational goal. The law does not require a maximum of racial mixing or \nstriking a racial balance accurately reflecting the racial composition of the community or the school population. It does \nnot require that each and every child shall attend a racially balanced school. This, we take it, is the sense in which the \nCivil Rights Commission used the phrase \"substantialintegration\". \nAs long as school boards understand the objective of desegregation and the necessity for complete disestablishment \nof segregation by converting the dual system to a nonracial unitary system, the nomenclature is unimportant. The \ncriterion for determining the validity of a provision in a desegregation plan is whether it is reasonably related to the \nobjective. We emphasize, therefore, the governmental objective and the specifics of the conversion process, rather \nthan the imagery evoked by the pejorative \"integration\". Decision-making in this important area of the law cannot be \nmade to turn upon a quibble devised over ten years ago by a court that misread Brown, misapplied the class action \ndoctrine in the school desegregation cases, and did not foresee the development of the law of equal opportunities. \n[6] Brown v.

Denison Independent School District, 5 Cir., 1965, 348 F.2d at 1010. \n[29] Revised Statement of Policies for School Desegregation Plans Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nMarch, 1966. \n[30] In Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 5 Cir. 1966, 364 F.2d 896, Judge Tuttle, for the \nCourt, noted that \"for many a year, it has been apparent to all concerned that the requirements of Singleton and \nDenison were the minimum standards to apply.\" \n[31] Title IV, § 407, 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-6 authorizing the Attorney General to bring suit, on receipt of a written \ncomplaint, would seem to imply this conclusion. Section 409 preserves the right of individual citizens \"to sue for or \nobtain relief\" against discrimination in public education. HEW Regulations provide: \"In any case in which a final order \nof a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of \nsuch a plan, such a plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such \norder.\" 45 C.F.R. § 80.4(c) (1964). \n[32] See footnote 17. \n[33] \"The Federal courts have been responsible for great qualitative advances in civil rights; the lack has been in \nquantitative implementation — in enabling the individual to avail himself of these great decisions.\" Bernhard and \nNatalie, Between Rights and Remedies, 53 Georgetown L. Jour. 915, 916 (1965). \"[I]t is the consensus of the judges \non the firing line, so to speak, that one phase in the administration of the law — the establishment phase, \ncharacterized by permissive tokenism, by a sort of minimal judicial holding of the line while the political process did, \nas it must, the main job of establishing — this phase has been closed out.\" Bickel, The Decade of School \nDesegregation, 64 Colum.L.Rev. 193, 209 (1964). \"The changes of the past decade have disappointed the most \noptimistic hopes, but they have been dramatically sweeping nonetheless.\" Gellhorn, A Decade of Desegregation — \nRetrospect and Prospect, 9 Utah L.Rev. 3 (1964). \"What makes one uneasy, of course is the truly awesome \nmagnitude of what has yet to be done.\" Thurgood Marshall, The Courts, in Center for the Study of Democratic \nInstitutions, The Maze of Modern Government 36 (1964), quoted in Pollak, Ten Years After the Decision, 24 Fed. Bar \nJour. 123 (1964). On the first decade of desegregation, see generally, Sarratt, The Ordeal of Desegregation (1966); \nLegal Aspects of the Civil Rights Movement (D. B.

S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, Office of Education, Release, Table 3, September 27, 1965. In the \n11 states of the Confederacy there are 1800 Negro teachers, 1.8 per cent of all the Negro teachers in Southern \nschools, assigned to schools with biracial faculties. By contrast, in the border states (Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, \nMissouri, Oklahoma, and West Virginia) 51 per cent of the Negro teachers now teach white students.

Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 5 Cir. 1966, 364 F.2d 896, 898, Judge Tuttle, for \nthe Court, said: \"This is the fourth appearance of this case before this court. This present appeal, coming as it does \nfrom an order of the trial court entered nearly eighteen months ago, on March 31, 1965, points up, among other \nthings, the utter impracticability of a continued exercise by the courts of the responsibility for supervising the manner \nin which segregated school systems break out of the policy of complete segregation into gradual steps of compliance \nand towards complete compliance with the constitutional requirements of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, \n74 S.Ct. 686. One of the reasons for the impracticability of this method of overseeing the transitional stages of \noperations of the school boards involved is that, under the Supreme Court's `deliberate speed' provisions, it has been \nthe duty of the appellate courts to interpret and reinterpret this language as time has grown apace, it now being the \ntwelfth school year since the Supreme Court's decision.\" \n[40] \"The pupil assignment acts have been the principal obstacle to desegregation in the South.\" U. S. Comm. on \nCivil Rights, Civil Rights U.S.A. — Public Schools, Southern States 15, 1962. See Note, The Federal Courts and \nIntegration of Southern Schools: Troubled Status of the Pupil Placement Acts, 62 Colum.L.Rev. 1448, 1471-73 \n(1962); Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 5 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 491. Such laws allow carefully screened Negro \nchildren, on their application, to transfer to white schools from the segregated schools to which the Negroes were \ninitially unconstitutionally assigned. Often, even after six to eight years of no desegregation, these transfers were \nlimited to a grade a year. When this law first came before us, we held it to be unconstitutional. Bush v. Orleans Parish \nSchool Board, E.D.La.1956, 138 F.Supp. 337, aff'd 242 F.2d 156, cert. den'd 354 U.S. 921, 77 S.Ct. 1380, 1 L.Ed.2d \n1436 (1957). Later, in a narrowly focused opinion, we held that the Alabama version was constitutional on its \nface. Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham Board of Education, N.D. Ala.1958, 162 F.Supp. 372, aff'd per curiam, 358 U.S. \n101, 79 S.Ct. 221, 3 L.Ed.2d 145 (1958). As long ago as 1959 and 1960 this Court disapproved of such acts as a \nreasonable start toward full compliance. Gibson v. Board of Public Instruction of Dade County, 5 Cir., 272 F. 2d \n763; Mannings v. Board of Public Instruction of Hillsborough County, 5 Cir., 277 F.2d 370. See also Bush v. Orleans \nParish School Board, 5 Cir. 1961, 308 F.2d 491: Evers v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1964, \n328 F.2d 408. \"[T]he entire public knows that in fact [the Louisiana law] * * * is being used to maintain segregation. * * \n* It is not a plan for desegregation at all.\" Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 308 F.2d at 499-500. \n[41] Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board is an example. The board was plagued by bundles of Louisiana statutes \naimed at defeating desegregation. There were five extra sessions of the Louisiana legislature in 1960. After the \nSchool Board had for three years failed to comply with an order to submit a plan, the district judge wrote one himself. \nThe trial judge simply said: \"[A]ll children [entering New Orleans public schools] * * * may attend either the formerly all \nwhite public schools nearest their homes or the formerly all negro public schools nearest their homes, at their option. \nB. Children may be transferred from one school to another, provided such transfers are not based on considerations \nof race\". 204 F.Supp. 568, 571-572. \n[42] For example, the order of the able district judge in Bush. See footnote 41. Judge Bohanon underscored this point \nin Dowell v. School Board of Oklahoma City Public Schools, W.D.Okla.1965, 244 F. Supp. 971, 976, aff'd, 10 Cir. \nJan. 23, 1967, 375 F.2d 158. \"The plan submitted to this Court * * * is not a plan, but a statement of policy. School \ndesegregation is a difficult and complicated matter, and, as the record shows, cannot be accomplished by a \nstatement of policy. ¶ Desegregation of public schools in a system as large as Oklahoma City requires a definite and \npositive plan providing definable and ascertainable goals to be achieved within a definite time according to a \nprepared procedure and with responsibilities clearly designated.\" \n\n[43] The Civil Rights Act of 1964 had its direct genesis in President Kennedy's message to Congress of June 19, \n1963, urging passage of an omnibus civil rights law. He noted: \"In the continued absence of congressional action, too \nmany State and local officials as well as businessmen will remain unwilling to accord these rights to all citizens. Some \nlocal courts and local merchants may well claim to be uncertain of the law, while those merchants who do recognize \nthe justice of the Negro's request (and I believe these constitute the great majority of merchants, North and South) \nwill be fearful of being the first to move, in the face of official customer, employee, or competitive pressures. Negroes, \nconsequently, can be expected to continue increasingly to seek the vindication of these rights through organized \ndirect action, with all its potentially explosive consequences, such as we have seen in Birmingham, in Philadelphia, in \nJackson, in Boston, in Cambridge, Md., and in many other parts of the country. ¶ In short, the result of continued \nFederal legislative inaction will be continued, if not increased, racial strife — causing the leadership on both sides to \npass from the hands of reasonable and responsible men to the purveyors of hate and violence, endangering \ndomestic tranquility, retarding our Nation's economic and social progress and weakening the respect with which the \nrest of the world regards us. No American, I feel sure, would prefer this course of tension, disorder, and division — \nand the great majority of our citizens simply cannot accept it.\" H.Doc. 124, 88th Cong. 1st Sess. June 20, 1963, Rep. \nEmanuel Celler, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced H.R. 7152 embodying the President's \nproposals. U. S. Congressional and Administrative News, p. 1527. The same day Senator Mike Mansfield introduced \na similar bill, S. 1731. H.R. 7152-S.1731, as amended, became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n[44] H.Rep.No.914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. \n[45] \"It was the Congressional purpose, in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to remove school desegregation \nefforts from the courts, where they had been bogged down for more than a decade. Unless the power of the Federal \npurse is more effectively utilized, resistance to national policy will continue and, in fact, will be reinforced.\" Report of \nthe White House Conference \"To Fulfill These Rights\", June 1-2, 1966, p. 63. \n[46] Rep.U.S.Comm. on Civil Rights, Survey of School Desegregation in the Southern and Border States — 1965-66, \np. 2. \n[47] Stone, The Common Law in the United States, 50 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 18 (1936). In a similar vein, writing for the \nCourt, Justice Stone has said: \"* * * in construing a statute setting up an administrative agency and providing for \njudicial review of its action, court and agency are not to be regarded as wholly independent and unrelated \ninstrumentalities of justice, each acting in the performance of its prescribed statutory duty without regard to the \nappropriate function of the other in securing the plainly indicated objects of the statute. Court and agency are the \nmeans adopted to attain the prescribed end, and so far as their duties are defined by the words of the statute, those \nwords should be construed so as to attain that end through co-ordinated action. Neither body should repeat in this \nday the mistake made by the courts of law when equity was struggling for recognition as an ameliorating system of \njustice; neither can rightly be regarded by the other as an alien intruder, to be tolerated if must be, but never to be \nencouraged or aided by the other in the attainment of the common aim.\" United States v. Morgan, 1939, 307 U.S. \n183, 191, 59 S.Ct. 795, 799, 83 L.Ed. 1211. \n[48] The Supreme Court also stated in Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 139-140, 65 S.Ct. at 164: \"The rulings of this \nAdministrator are not reached as a result of hearing adversary proceedings in which he finds facts from evidence and \nreaches conclusions of law from findings of fact. They are not, of course, conclusive, even in the cases with which \nthey directly deal, much less in those to which they apply only by analogy. They do not constitute an interpretation of \nthe Act or a standard for judging factual situations which binds a district court's processes, as an authoritative \npronouncement of a higher court might do. But the Administrator's policies are made in pursuance of official duty, \nbased upon more specialized experience and broader investigations and information than is likely to come to a judge \nin a particular case. They do determine the policy which will guide applications for enforcement by injunction on \nbehalf of the Government. Good administration of the Act and good judicial administration alike require that the \nstandards of public enforcement and those for determining private rights shall be at variance only where justified by \nvery good reasons.\" (Emphasis added.) \n[49] The following statement appeared in the Shreveport Journal for July 1, 1965: \"The local school boards prefer a \ncourt order over the voluntary plan because HEW regulations governing the voluntary plans or compliance \nagreements demand complete desegregation of the entire system, including students, faculty, staff, lunch workers, \nbus drivers, and administrators, whereas the court-ordered plans can be more or less negotiated with the judge.\" This \nwas not news to the Court. \n[50] We may also expect a number of school desegregation suits to be filed in Alabama. The legislature has enacted \na statute declaring the Guidelines null and void in Alabama and prohibiting school officials signing any agreement to \n\ncomply. The bill provides that any agreement or assurance of compliance with the guidelines already in effect \"is null \nand void and shall have no binding effect.\" H.B. 446, approved September 2, 1966. \n[51] The brief of the United States gives the following figures: \n                                  1.

It is not possible, or even \ndesirable, of course to achieve absolute uniformity.

In Blocker Judge Zavitt notes that \"this construction draws continuing sustenance through a process in \nwhich each case relies upon the preceding one; it would appear that the ultimate and solitary source is this dictum in \nBriggs v. Elliott.\" 226 F.Supp. at 220. \nIn Borders v. Rippy, 5 Cir. 1957, 247 F.2d 268, the Court reversed the judgment of the district court dismissing the \ncomplaint and directed the entry of a judgment enjoining the defendants \"from requiring segregation of the races in \nany school under their supervision\". On remand, the district court entered an order enjoining the defendants \"from \nrequiring or permitting segregation of the races in any school under their supervision\". On the second appeal, \nin Rippy v. Borders, 5 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 690, 692, the Court again reversed the district court, stating: \"We have \nemphasized the words `or permitting segregation of the races' in the district court's order because that expression \nmight indicate a serious misconception of the applicable law and of the mandate of this Court. Our mandate (footnote \n1, supra) had been carefully limited so as to direct the entry of a judgment restraining and enjoining the defendants \n`from requiring segregation of the races in any school under their supervision' (emphasis supplied). Likewise in our \nopinion, we had pointed out that it is only racially discriminatory segregation in the public schools which is forbidden \nby the Constitution.\" \n[58] In Kemp v. Beasley the Eighth Circuit remarked, \"The dictum in Briggs has not been followed or adopted by this \nCircuit and it is logically inconsistent with Brown.\" Blocker v. Board of Education of Manhasset, E.D.N.Y.1964, 226 \nF.Supp. 208, makes a frontal attack on Briggs. In that case, which concerned segregation characterized as de \njure, Judge Zavatt observed that even where the Briggs dictum has seemingly been adopted, \"it appears to be in a \nstate of diminishing force, if not outright erosion\", citing Dillard v. School Board of the City of Charlottesville, 4 Cir. \n1962, 308 F.2d 920, cert. denied, 374 U.S. 827, 83 S.Ct. 1864, 10 L.Ed.2d 1051 (1963), and McCoy v. Greensboro \nCity Board of Education, 4 Cir. 1960, 283 F.2d 667. The Third Circuit, reversing a district court's approval of a year-\nby-year plan, ignored Briggs: \"if the plan as approved by the court below be not drastically modified, a large number \nof the Negro children of Delaware will be deprived of education in integrated schools despite the fact that \nthe Supreme Court has unqualifiedly declared integration to be their constitutional right.\" (Emphasis added.) Evans v. \nEnnis, 3 Cir. 1960, 281 F.2d 385, 389, cert. den'd 364 U.S. 933, 81 S.Ct. 379, 5 L.Ed.2d 365. In Evans v. Ennis, only \nthree school districts were involved. Nevertheless, the court required the district judge to order the State Board of \nEducation and the State Superintendent of Delaware to prepare a plan \"which will provide for the integration at all \ngrades of the public school system of Delaware.\" \"Eventually,\" Judge Biggs said, \"a wholly integrated school system \nwill be effected for Delaware: `wholly integrated' in the sense that all school children, whether white or Negro, * * * will \nattend public schools without regard for race or color.\" Sometimes a court's action in regard to the school board's \naffirmative duty has spoken louder than Briggs's words. In Evans v. Buchanan, D.C.Del.1962, 207 F.Supp. \n820, although the court cited Briggs and stated that the Fourteenth Amendment \"does not contemplate compelling \naction; rather, it is a prohibition preventing the States from applying their laws unequally\", the court did compel the \nschool boards to act. The Court found that the Negro school children who wished to attend integrated schools were \nattending an all-Negro school, with an all-Negro faculty, surrounded by white attendance area. On those bare facts, \nthe Court found: \"The * * * Board as promulgator of the plan and the State Board of Education as the party having the \nultimate responsibility for administering a nondiscriminatory system of public education should have the initial burden \nof coming forward since a presumption of unconstitutionality arises under this set of facts.\" 207 F.Supp. at 825. \n(Emphasis added.) The facts were \"highly probative\" of intentional racial discrimination and the evidence of intent \nrested largely with the Board. The Board came forward and showed that its plan was based on such neutral factors \nas the safety of the children, facilities, location, and access roads. The court, however, held that the Board did not \nrebut the presumption by showing that the plan could be justified as rational and nondiscriminatory. The obviously \nsophisticated trial judge observed, \"In effect, counsel is asking the States to intentionally gerrymander districts which \nmay be rational when viewed by acceptable, nondiscriminatory criteria\". Id. at 824. \n[59] See U.S.Comm. on Civil Rights, Civil Rights U.S.A. — Public Schools, Southern States (1962), p. 7. \n[60] For example: \"* * * the essence of the constitutional right is that it is a personal one. * * * It is the individual who is \nentitled to the equal protection of the laws, and if he is denied by a common carrier, acting in the matter under the \nauthority of a state law, a facility or convenience in the course of his journey which under substantially the same \ncircumstances is furnished to another traveler, he may properly complain that his constitutional privilege has been \ninvaded\".

The same situation exists with regard to denial of \nequal educational opportunities. So-called freedom of choice plans, as thus far utilized, follow pupil placement laws, \nwhich followed the \"separate-but-equal\" dodge in the educational series of devices to limit access of Negroes to the \npolity. \n[64] Note, 20 U.Chi.L.Rev. 577 (1953). \n[65] Meador, The Constitution and the Assignment of Pupils to Pupilc Schools, 45 Va.L.Rev. 517, 523 (1959). \n[66] In Brown the unanimous court, through Chief Justice Warren, cited the Slaughter House Cases, 1872, 83 U.S. \n(16 Wall.) 36, 71, 21 L.Ed. 394 in which the Court stated: \"* * * one pervading purpose found in [all of these \namendments], lying at the foundation of each, and without which none of them would have been even suggested; we \nmean the freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the \nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised unlimited dominion over \nhim. It is true that only the Fifteenth Amendment, in terms, mentions the negro by speaking of his color and his \nslavery. But it is just as true that each of the other articles was addressed to the grievances of that race, and \ndesigned to remedy them as the fifteenth.\" The Court also quoted the following passage from Strauder v. State of \nWest Virginia, 1879, 100 U.S. 303, 307, 25 L.Ed. 664: \"The words of the amendment * * * contain a necessary \nimplication of a positive immunity, or right, most valuable to the colored race, — the right to exemption from unfriendly \nlegislation against them distinctly as colored, — exemption from legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil \nsociety, lessening the security of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy, and discriminations which are steps \ntowards reducing them to the condition of a subject race.\" \n\n[67] \"[T]he courts will require that the defendants make a prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance with our \nMay 17, 1954, ruling. Once such a start has been made, the courts may find that additional time is necessary to carry \nout the ruling in an effective manner. * * * To that end, the courts may consider problems related to administration, \narising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school \ndistricts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools \non a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing \nproblems.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300-301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756 (Emphasis added.) \n[68] \"If it is the Negro population as a minority group which is entitled to attend public facilities, then the objective of \nany corrective plan would be to bring about complete integration of all Negro children in public education.\" Hartman, \nThe Right to Equal Educational Opportunities as a Personal and Present Right, 9 Wayne L.Rev. 424, 441 (1963). Cf. \nGreenberg, Race Relations and Group Interests in the Law, 13 Rutgers L.Rev. 503, 506 (1959). There would be no \nnecessary conflict between the individual's \"personal and present\" right and the class right if the Brown, Cooper v. \nAaron, Bradley, and Rogers v. Paul decisions were read as recognizing the immediate right of any Negro plaintiff to \ntransfer to a white school, over and above the state's duty to reorganize its school system. Thus in Watson v. City of \nMemphis, 1963, 373 U.S. 526, 533, 83 S.Ct. 1314, 1318, 10 L.Ed.2d 529, the Supreme Court stated that the rights \nasserted in that case \"are, like all such rights, present rights * * * warrants for the here and now and, unless there is \nan overwhelmingly compelling reason, they are to be promptly fulfilled.\" \n[68a] \"A year later, when the `deliberate speed' formula was promulgated, the significance of the changed emphasis \nbecame clear. The Court had determined to deal with the problem as involving the rights of the Negro race rather \nthan the rights of individuals.\" Lusky, The Stereotype: Hard Core of Racism, 13 Buffalo Law Review, p. 450, 458 \n(1964). \n[69] \"Indeed, the requirement of affirmative action lies at the very heart of Brown; seventeen states had to abandon \nracial criteria and affirmatively reorganized school attendance plans.\" Fiss, Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools: \nThe Constitutional Concepts, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 564, 612 (1965). See also Gillmor and Gosule, Duty to Integrate Public \nSchools? Some Judicial Responses and a Statute, 46 Bost.U.L.Rev. 45, 62-3 (1966). \"State support of segregated \nschools through any arrangement, management, funds, or property cannot be squared with the [equal protection \nclause].\" Cooper v. Aaron, 1958, 358 U.S. 1, 19, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 1410, 3 L.Ed.2d 5. \"* * * Most of the major decisions \nof the Warren Court under the equal protection clause impose affirmative obligations upon the states. Earlier cases \nsustaining a constitutional claim were typically mandates directing the government to refrain from a particular form of \nregulation. Now the emphasis is upon measures the states must adopt in carrying on their activities and steps they \nmust take [even] to offset disabilities not of their creation\". Cox, Foreword: Constitutional Adjudication and the \nPromotion of Human Rights, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 91, 93 (1966). \n[70] The Court also said: \"There is at least considerable doubt that relief confined to individual specified Negro \nchildren either could be granted or, if granted, could be so limited in its operative effect. By the nature of the \ncontroversy, the attack is on the unconstitutional practice of racial discrimination. Once that is found to exist, the \nCourt must order that it be discontinued. Such a decree, of course, might name the successful plaintiff as the party \nnot to be discriminated against. But that decree may not — either expressly or impliedly — affirmatively authorize \ncontinued discrimination by reason of race against others. Cf. Shelley v. Kraemer, 1948, 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 \nL.Ed. 1161. Moreover, to require a school system to admit the specific successful plaintiff Negro child while others, \nhaving no such protection, were required to attend schools in a racially segregated system, would be for the court to \ncontribute actively to the class discrimination proscribed by Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 5 Cir. 1962, 308 \nF.2d 491, 499, on rehearing 308 F.2d 503; see also Ross v. Dyer, 5 Cir., 1962, 312 F.2d 191.\" Potts v. Flax, 313 F.2d \nat 289. \n[71] The Court also said: \"Geographical districts based on race are a parish-wide system of unconstitutional \nclassification. Of course, it is undoubtedly true that Brown v. Board of Education dealt with only an individual child's \nright to be admitted to a particular school on a non-racial basis. And it is also true, as the second Brown opinion \npointed out, that courts must bear in mind the `personal interest' of the plaintiffs. In this sense, the Brown cases held \nthat the law requires non-discrimination as to the individual, not integration. But when a statute has a state-wide \ndiscriminatory effect or when a School Board maintains a parish-wide discriminatory policy or system, the \ndiscrimination is against Negroes as a class. Here, for example, it is the Orleans Parish dual system of segregated \nschool districts, affecting all school children in the Parish by race, that, first, was a discriminatory classification and, \nsecond, established the predicate making it possible for the Pupil Placement Act to fulfill its behind-the-face function \nof preserving segregation.\" Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 308 F.2d at 499. \n\n[72] See, for example, Ransmier, The Fourteenth Amendment and the \"Separate but Equal\" Doctrine, 50 Mich.L.Rev. \n203, 238-40 (1951); Roche, Education, Segregation and the Supreme Court — A Political Analysis, 99 U.Pa.L.Rev. \n949 (1951); Taylor, The Demise of Race Restrictions in Graduate Education, 1 Duke B.Jour. 135 (1951); Note, 26 St. \nJohn's L.Rev. 123 (1951). \n[73] Professor Edmund Cahn characterized as a \"myth\" the notion that the Brown decision was \"sociological\" rather \nthan \"legal\". Cahn, Jurisprudence, 31 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 182 (1956); Cahn, Jurisprudence, 30 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 150 (1955). \"I \nwould not have the constitutional rights of Negroes — or of other Americans — rest on any such flimsy foundation as \nsome of the scientific demonstrations in these records. * * * Heretofore, no government official has contended that he \ncould deny equal protection with impunity unless the complaining parties offered competent proof that they would \nsustain or had sustained some permanent (psychological or other kind of) damage. The right to equal protection has \nnot been subjected to any such proviso.\" Cahn, Jurisprudence, 30 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 150, 157, 158, 168 (1955). Professor \nBlack has said: \"The charge that it is `sociological' is either a truism or a canard — a truism if it means that the Court, \nprecisely like the Plessy court, and like innumerable other courts facing innumerable other issues of law, had to \nresolve and did resolve a question about social fact; a canard if it means that anything like principal reliance was \nplaced on the formally `scientific' authorities, which are relegated to a footnote and treated as merely corroboratory of \ncommon sense.\" Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decision, 69 Yale L.J. 421, 430 n. 25 (1960). \nAcceptance of these views is not inconsistent with the continued vitality of the psychological findings in Brown \nI. Indeed, several studies have reinforced those findings. The most recent is the United States Office of Education's \n\"Equality of Educational Opportunity\", the two-year study authorized by section 402 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to \ninvestigate \"the lack of availability of equal educational opportunities for individuals by reason of race, color, religion, \nor national origin in public educational institutions * * *.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000c — 1. \n[74] See Stell v.

Compare the statement of policy in the Massachusetts statute, An Act \nProviding for the Elimination of Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools (Mass. Acts. 1965, ch. 651): \nIt is hereby declared to be the policy of the commonwealth to encourage all school committees to adopt as \neducational objectives the promotion of racial balance and the correction of existing racial imbalance in the public \nschools. The prevention or elimination of racial imbalance shall be an objective in all decisions involving the drawing \nor altering of school attendance lines and the selection of new school sites. \nThe statute was enacted a month after Barksdale was decided. \n[85] \"Some of the Supreme Court's language in Brown can apply to this type of segregation as well as to that before \nthe Court, since this type of imbalance may also `generate a feeling of inferiority as to [the Negro children's] status in \nthe community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.' Thus, if one believes that \nthe basis of the Brown decision was the Court's finding that separate schools were unconstitutional simply because \nthey bred a feeling of inferiority in the Negro, one must also believe that the neighborhood school must also be \nunconstitutional if it breeds the same feeling of inferiority.\" Kaplan, Segregation Litigation and the Schools — Part 1, \nThe New Rochelle Experience 58 NW U.L.Rev. 1, 21 (1964). \"Necessarily implied in [Brown's] * * * proscription of \nsegregat[ed education] was the positive obligation of eliminating it.\" Taylor v.

Of course, it might be \nargued that many of the evils the school board attempts to eliminate when it takes correctional steps are not \nattributable to the race of the individuals within the imbalanced school, but instead are attributable to their social \nclass. Yet, certain of these evils are uniquely related to the fact that the imbalance is a racial one; namely, those \nattributable to the personal impact of the imbalance on the Negro. Moreover, most Negroes in the ghetto, and hence \nattending an imbalanced school, are members of the lowest economic class, and thus the board's remedial measures \nwill tend to cure the social imbalance as well.\" Fiss, Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools: The Constitutional \nConcepts, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 564, 577-78 (1965). \n[90] Wright, Public School Desegregation: Legal Remedies for De Facto Segregation, 16 West.Res.L.Rev. 478, 489 \n(1965). \n[91] Addabbo v.

E.2d 112 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 905, 86 S.Ct. 241 (1965). \n[92] For example, \"Racial imbalance\" and \"de facto segregation\" are \"used synonymously * * * [to] refer to a situation \nwhere a school is predominantly composed of Negro students not as a result of state action but rather as the end \nproduct of segregated housing and adherence to the neighborhood school plan.\" Gillmor and Gosule, 46 Boston \nU.L.Rev. 45, 46 (1966). The term \"de facto segregation\" has become accepted as denoting non-racially motivated \nseparation of the races as opposed to \"de jure segregation\" denoting deliberate separation of the races by law. Since \nsegregation is unconstitutional, each is a contradiction in terms. One student of the problem has pointed out, \"The \nterm de facto segregation makes the racially imbalanced school appear * * * [to be] the Northern counter-part of \nsegregated education under Jim Crow laws * * *. As such the term distorts reality and paralyzes thought. [Racial] \nimbalance is frequently labeled `de facto' segregation to suggest that the requisite governmental involvement cannot \nbe found.\" Fiss, Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools: The Constitutional Concepts, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 564, 566, 584 \n(1965). Another has said, \"As a more accurate term, racial imbalance will be used to denote fortuitous racial \nseparation in the public schools\". King, Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools: Constitutional Dimensions and \nJudicial Response, 18 Vand.L.Rev. 1290, 1291 (1965). \n\"De facto segregation has become the short way of describing the existing situation in northern cities. * * * a school \nsystem which is marked by a very high proportion of Negroes in some of its schools, and few or none in others, but in \nwhich this separation has taken place without the compulsion of a state law or officially announced policy requiring \nthat Negro and white children be placed in separate schools.\" Hyman and New-house, Desegregation of the Schools: \nThe Present Legal Situation, 14 Buff.L.Rev. 208, 221 (1964). See also Carter, De Facto Segregation, 16 \nWest.Res.L.Rev. 502, 503 (1965). \n[93] The rationale of the neighborhood school system is that the school serves as the educational, recreational, and \ncultural center of the community. See Hansen, The Role of Educators, 34 Notre Dame L. Rev. 652, 654 (1959). \nProponents of the view that neighborhood schools may become so racially imbalanced as to require affirmative \n\ncorrective action point out: \"The modern-day neighborhood school cannot be equated with the common school of \nyesteryear — the latter constitutes America's ideal of a democratic institution — a single structure serving a \nheterogeneous community in which children of varied racial, cultural, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds \nwere taught together — the proverbial melting pot. Because of rigid racial and socio-economic stratification, ethnic \nand class similarity has become the most salient present-day neighborhood characteristic, particularly in urban areas. \nThe neighborhood school, which encompasses a homogeneous racial and socio-economic grouping, as is true today, \nis the very antithesis of the common school heritage.\" Carter, De Facto School Segregation: An Examination of the \nLegal and Constitutional Questions Presented, 16 West.Res.L.Rev. 502. 507 (1965). See also Sedler, School \nSegregation in the North and West: Legal Aspects, 7 St. Louis U.L.J. 228, 252-56 (1963). \n[94] For some idea of the number and complexity of the administrative problems school officials face in dealing with \nde facto segregation, see Kaplan, Segregation Litigation and the Schools — Part II: The General Northern Problem, \n58 NW. U.L.Rev. 157, 182-186 (1963). Professor Kaplan quotes at length excerpts from the testimony in Bell. \n[94a] The question of providing special, earmarked federal funds for school districts that were trying to correct \nimbalanced neighborhood schools came up again in connection with the 1966 amendments to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965. The House committee recommended special priority for applications under Title III \nof the Act from local school districts which sought help with problems of overcrowding, obsolescence, or racial \nimbalance. The House withdrew priority for dealing with problems of racial imbalance and added an amendment to \nSection 604 of the Act to the effect that nothing in the Act be construed to \"require the assignment or transportation of \nstudents or teachers in order to overcome racial imbalance.\" The Senate went along with both actions. The debate \nmakes clear that Congress was once again talking about racial imbalance in the context of de facto, not de jure, \nschool segregation. See particularly Congressional Record, October 6, 1966, pp. 24538-9; 24541-3. See also 1966 \nU.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, pp. 3865, 3866, for language in House committee report \nrecommending the priority position of applications to deal with racial imbalance. \n[95] Congressman Cramer's amendment. \n[96] This restriction appears in § 407 of the Act. In its context it seems clearly to restrict the Attorney General to \nrequesting only such relief as is constitutionally compelled. In other words, the Act is not to be construed as \nauthorizing a statutory duty to reduce imbalance by bussing. Certainly the language of § 407 does not call for a \nconstruction that prohibits a court order directing that school boards abandon racially discriminatory practices which \nviolate the Constitution. Nor does it suggest that the Attorney General is precluded from requesting court orders to \nend racial imbalance resulting from unconstitutional practices. \n[97] See Hearings Before the Committee on Rules, House of Representatives, 89 Cong. 2nd Sess., on H.Rep., 826, \nSept. 29-30, 1966, 24-26, 37-40. \n[98] See footnote 19. \n[99] BNA Operations Manual, The Civil Rights Act of 1964, p. 359. \n[100] See Note, Desegregation of Public School Activities, 51 Iowa L.Rev. 681, 690-96 (1966). \n[101] Senator Humphrey explained: The \"elimination of racial discrimination in employment or assignment of teachers \n* * * does not mean that Title VI would authorize a federal official to prescribe [particular] pupil assignments, or to \nselect a [particular] faculty as opponents of the bill have suggested. The only authority conferred would be authority to \nadopt, with the approval of the President, a general requirement that the local school authority refrain from racial \ndiscrimination in treatment of pupils and teachers * * *.\" 110 Cong.Rec. 6545. \n[102] Smith v. Board of Education of Morrilton, 8 Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 770, 784. \n[103] For example, Lockett v. Board of Education of Muscogee County, 5 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 225, 229; Calhoun v. \nLatimer, 5 Cir. 1963, 321 F.2d 302, 307; Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, 4 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 310, \n320. \n[104] Chambers v. Hendersonville City Board of Education, 4 Cir. 1966, 364 F.2d 189, 192, involved the problem of \nsurplus Negro teachers who lost their jobs when an all Negro school was abolished. The School Board treated them \n\nas new applicants. The court held that this was discriminatory. Speaking for the majority, Judge Bell said: \"First, the \nmandate of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), forbids the consideration \nof race in faculty selection just as it forbids it in pupil placement. See Wheeler v. Durham City Board of Education, \n346 F.2d 768, 773 (4 Cir. 1965). Thus the reduction in the number of Negro pupils did not justify a corresponding \nreduction in the number of Negro teachers. Franklin v. County Board of Giles County, 360 F.2d 325 (4 Cir. 1966). \nSecond, the Negro school teachers were public employees who could not be discriminated against on account of \ntheir race with respect to their retention in the system. Johnson v. Branch, 364 F.2d 177, (4 Cir. 1966) * * *.\" \n[105] The present Commissioner of Education, Harold Howe II, in a congressional hearing declared: \n\"The guidelines do not mention and do not require `racial balance' or the correction of racial `imbalance.' Nor have we \nin the administration of our obligations under Title VI sought to establish `racial balance.' They deal only with \ndesegregation plans designed to eliminate the dual school systems for whites and Negroes, systems being operated \nin violation of the 1954 Supreme Court ruling. * * * Racial imbalance certainly means the notion of trying to establish \nsome proportion of youngsters that must be in each and every school. We are not about such an enterprise. We are \ntrying to give the effect of free choices to enter into, or to allow free choices in having pupils enter into whatever \nschool they may wish to attend. I do not believe that free choice plans were ever intended by the courts or by us to be \nan arrangement whereby the dual school system could continue without support of law. But rather an arrangement by \nwhich over a period of time we would gradually have one school system rather than two separate school systems. I \ndo not see that we are engaged in any way in establishing procedures for balance.\" Hearings before the Committee \non Rules, House of Representatives, 89th Cong. 2nd Sess., on H.Res. 26, Sept. 29-30, 1966, p. 32-34. \nSee also footnote 106. \n[106] In a letter addressed to Members of Congress and Governors, dated April 9, 1966, and given wide publicity in \nthe press, John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare explained the purpose of the percentages: \n\"The second area of concern involves the percentages mentioned in the guidelines. Some have contended that this \nportion of the guidelines imposes a formula of `racial balance.' This contention misconceives the purpose of the \npercentages. The prevailing method of desegregation is what is called the `free choice' plan. Under such a plan, \nstudents select their schools instead of being assigned to them on a geographic basis. Courts have expressly \nconditioned their approval of such plans on affirmative action by school boards to insure that `free choice' actually \nexists. It is our responsibility to review such plans to insure that the choice is, in fact, free and to indicate to school \ndistricts what procedures should be used to assure true freedom of choice. \nIn seeking appropriate criteria to guide us in review of free choice plans, we have adopted the objective criteria \napplied by the courts in similar situations. One such criterion is the distribution of students by race in the various \nschools of a system after the students have made their choices. If substantial numbers of Negro children choose and \ngo to previously all-white schools, the choice system is clearly operating freely. If few or none choose to do so in a \ncommunity where there has been a pattern of segregation, then it is appropriate that the free choice plan be reviewed \nand other factors considered to determine whether the system is operating freely. \nWith more than 2000 separate districts to consider, such percentages are thus an administrative guide which helps \nus to determine those districts requiring further review. Such review in turn will determine whether or not the freedom \nof choice plan is in fact working fairly.\" New York Times, April 12, 1966, page 1. \nPrinted in Hearings before the Committee on Rules, House of Representatives, 89 Cong. 2nd Sess., on H.Res. 826, \nSept. 29-30, 1966, p. 31. Commissioner Howe reaffirmed Secretary Gardner's policies as stated in the letter. See \nHearings on H.Res. 826, p. 30-33. \n[107] \"[V]ery decided variations in proportions of Negroes and whites on jury lists from racial proportions in the \npopulation, which variations are not explained and are long continued, furnish sufficient evidence of systematic \nexclusion of Negroes from jury service.\" United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 53, 67. \n[108] In United States v. Ward, supra, 349 F.2d at 803, the Court compared the number of Negroes registered with \nthe number of Negroes eligible to vote. A similar practice is used in proving systematic exclusion of Negroes from \njuries. Cassell v. State of Texas, 1950, 339 U.S. 282, 70 S.Ct. 629, 94 L.Ed. 839; Avery v.

In \neach instance, percentage tests have been used not as an effort to affect racial balance, but as a means of \n\ndetermining whether a challenged procedure is operating in a way that violates constitutional rights. See Finkelstein, \nThe Application of Statistical Decision Theory to the Jury Discrimination Cases, 80 Harv.L.Rev. 338 (1966). \n[109] See footnote 58. \n[110] Rep.U.S.Comm. on Civil Rights, Survey of School Desegregation in the Southern and Border States — 1965-\n66, p. 51. \"Freedom of choice plans accepted by the Office of Education have not disestablished the dual and racially \nsegregated school systems involved, for the following reasons: a. Negro and white schools have tended to retain their \nracial identity; b. White students rarely elect to attend Negro schools; c. Some Negro students are reluctant to sever \nnormal school ties, made stronger by the racial identification of their schools; d. Many Negro children and parents in \nSouthern States, having lived for decades in positions of subservience, are reluctant to assert their rights; e. Negro \nchildren and parents in Southern States frequently will not choose a formerly all-white school because they fear \nretaliation and hostility from the white community; f. In some school districts in the South school officials have failed to \nprevent or punish harassment by white children of Negro children who have elected to attend white schools; g.

Beasley, 8 Cir. 1965, 352 F. 2d 14, 21. \n[114] This was not new.

However, the press has carried accounts that progress is being made toward \"desegregation \nof teachers, administrators and other personnel\" for 1967-68 in Jackson, Mississippi. See Jackson Clarion Ledger, \nJuly 30, 1966, page 1. \n[116] \"Faculty desegregation is a necessary precondition of an acceptable free choice plan. A free choice plan cannot \ndisestablish the dual school system where faculties remain segregated on the basis of the race of the teachers or the \npupils. In such circumstances a school inevitably will remain identified as \"white\" and \"Negro\" depending on the color \nof the teachers.\" Rep., U.S.Comm. on Civil Rights, Survey of Desegregation in the Southern and Border States — \n1965-66, p. 57. \n[117] Faculties should be desegregated so that \"both white and Negro students would feel that their color was \nrepresented upon an equal level and that their people were sharing the responsibility of high-level teaching\". Dowell \nv. School Board of Oklahoma City Public Schools, W.D.Okla.1965, 219 F.Supp. 427. \n[118] In Kier the Court said that duty to desegregate faculty must be \"immediately and squarely met\"; there can be no \nfreedom of choice for faculties and administrative staffs by the 1966-67 school year. Insofar as possible, \"the \npercentage of the Negro teachers in each school in the system should approximate the percentage of Negro teachers \nin the entire system for the 1965-66 season\". 249 F.Supp. at 22. \n[119] Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame and a member of the Civil Rights Commission, makes \nthese suggestions: \"A realistic and quite possible approach to this is, I think, through the immediate improvement of \n\nall teachers of each race, beginning with those who most need assistance in being better qualified as teachers. ¶ At \nthis precise time of transition, why not institute along with the whole process of desegregation in the South a positive \nprogram of upgrading all teachers in the present systems? In fact, the best teachers of either race, worthy of their \nprofession, should be put in the schools needing the most help to improve. One might even think of rotating teachers \nwithin the schools of a given district. There is already the existing pattern of academic year and summer institutes for \njust this purpose of improving teachers. * * * ¶ If this positive action could be moved along quickly, with good will from \nall concerned, school administrators, parents, and students, then we could eliminate the present cat-and-mouse \ngame which is going on between the Federal Office of Education and the local Southern school districts. In fact, I \nhave a feeling that the South could solve its problem long before the North, which has an educational desegregation \nproblem which may be less amenable to solution because of entrenched patterns of housing segregation.\" Rep., U.S. \nComm. on Civil Rights, Survey of Desegregation in the Southern and Border States — 1965-66, p. 64. \n[120] \"Although only 164 (3.4 percent) of the 4,941 school districts in the South have qualified by the court order \nroute, these districts include most of the major cities of the South and, accordingly, a large share of the population. \nCourt orders are a significant method of qualification, particularly in Louisiana, where official resistance to compliance \nwith Title VI has been most widespread.

JONES, et al., Plaintiffs, \nv. \nCADDO PARISH SCHOOL BOARD, et al., Defendants-Appellees, \nv. \nJune PHILLIPS, Movant-Appellant. \nNo. 81-3439. \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. \nMay 6, 1983. \n207*207 Troy E. Bain, Shreveport, La., for movant-appellant. \nBeard, Arceneaux & Sutherland, Fred H. Sutherland, Shreveport, La., Wm. Yeomans, \nAlexandria, Va., for defendants-appellees. \nBefore GOLDBERG, WILLIAMS and GARWOOD, Circuit Judges. \nGARWOOD, Circuit Judge: \nJune Phillips appeals from a denial of her motion to intervene, both individually and on \nbehalf of a class, in this litigation concerning the desegregation of the Caddo Parish school \nsystem. We agree with the district court that Ms. Phillips' motion failed to satisfy a \nprerequisite for intervention under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24; accordingly, we affirm the denial of her \npetition. \n PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n208*208\nThis action began in 1965 when seven black school children and their parents filed a \ncomplaint alleging that the Caddo Parish public schools were operated on a biracial basis, \nin violation of the rights secured to them under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth \namendment. Plaintiffs sought to represent themselves and a class of \"Negro children and \ntheir parents in Caddo Parish,\" pursuant to Rule 23(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure as then in effect (the 1938 version).[1] The district court, per Judge Dawkins, \n\nenjoined the operation of the dual school system and ordered the Caddo Parish School \nBoard to prepare a desegregation plan. Following the submission of the School Board's \nproposal, the United States moved to intervene as a party plaintiff pursuant to Title IX of the \n1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2.[2] The district court adopted the School Board's \ndesegregation scheme and denied intervention by the United States; both of these actions \nwere reversed by our decision in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 \nF.2d 836 (5th Cir.1966), aff'd with modifications,380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. \ndenied, 389 U.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 77, 19 L.Ed.2d 104 (1967). The United States has been an \nactive participant in this litigation since the decision in Jefferson County. \nSubsequent desegregation plans adopted in Caddo Parish were disapproved by this Court \nin Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 417 F.2d 801 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. \n904, 90 S.Ct. 218, 24 L.Ed.2d 180 (1969) (rejecting a freedom of choice plan), and Jones v. \nCaddo Parish School Board, 421 F.2d 313 (5th Cir.1970) (reversing the district court's \napproval of a plan submitted by the School Board and remanding for consideration \nof Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 419 F.2d 1211 (5th Cir.1969) \n(en banc), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1032, 90 S.Ct. 611, 24 L.Ed.2d 698 (1970)). \nIn February 1972, plaintiffs filed a petition for further relief which requested the elimination \nof racially identifiable schools and professional staffs, and a judgment declaring the \napportionment scheme for School Board elections to be unconstitutional. The petition was \nsigned by Arthur Thompson of the law firm of Stone & Thompson. Nine days later, an \namended motion for further relief was filed. This motion, after acknowledging the prior \nrequest, focused on the School Board's failure to dismantle \"schools with substantially \ndisproportionate racial compositions\" and sought the elimination of the remaining vestiges \nof the dual school system. The attorney who signed the amended motion was Margrett \nFord. In previous filings Ms. Ford had been listed in association with Jack Greenberg and \nNorman Chachkin of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York City; however, she had \nrecently notified the district court of her new address in Shreveport, Louisiana. While these \nmotions were pending, Judge Dawkins recused himself from the case and Judge Scott took \nthe helm. \n209*209 In March 1973, the United States responded to the motions for relief by requesting \nthat the court appoint a biracial committee of citizens of Caddo Parish (the \"Committee\") to \nassess the progress of the existing desegregation scheme and to develop alternate \nproposals. Judge Scott ordered the establishment of such Committee, which presented its \nreport and desegregation plan on June 1, 1973. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs—through \nMargrett Ford— filed their objections to the pupil assignment portion of the Committee's \nproposed method of desegregation. Ms. Ford also moved to add additional parties as \nplaintiffs. The United States objected to the Committee plan because it permitted the \ncontinued operation of thirty-four one-race or predominately one-race schools. \nPrior to the disposition of these objections, Jesse Stone (of Stone & Thompson), plaintiffs' \noriginal retained counsel, moved to strike Arthur Thompson, Margrett Ford, Jack \nGreenberg, and Norman Chachkin as counsel for plaintiffs and to substitute in their place \nMurphy Bell. Attached to this motion was the affidavit of Reverend E. Edward Jones, one of \nthe original named plaintiffs in the action, stating that Arthur Thompson had been elected to \nthe Caddo Parish School Board and, hence, must withdraw as plaintiffs' representative, and \n\nthat the lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund were being dismissed \"because of \nthe objections [they] filed to the Court Appointed Citizens Committee Desegregation \nPlan.\"[3] The motion to substitute counsel was signed by Judge Scott on July 13, 1973. A \nfew days later, Judge Scott denied the motion to add additional party plaintiffs.[4] Newly \nappointed plaintiffs' counsel, Mr. Bell, then filed a motion seeking to strike the objections to \nthe Committee's desegregation plan that had previously been lodged by Ms. Ford.[5] The \nobjections were deleted by an order of the district court dated July 20, 1973. That same \nday, the court adopted the Committee's desegregation plan and directed that it be \nimplemented in time for the start of the 1973-74 school year. \nFour months later, lawyers Greenberg, Chachkin, and Ford filed a motion to intervene on \nbehalf of several black school children and their parents who resided in Caddo \nParish.[6] The application for intervention stated that the named individuals sought to \nrepresent a \"class of present and future black public school children who are or will be \neligible to attend the public schools of Caddo Parish.\" Appended to the application for \nintervention was the complaint of plaintiffs-intervenors, which assailed the constitutionality \nof the Committee's pupil assignment plan for its retention of one-race schools within the \nparish. Finding that the original plaintiffs adequately represented the class and that the \nmotion to intervene was untimely, the district court denied the application for intervention. \nThat decision was vacated by this Court and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the \nmotion to intervene. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914 (5th \nCir.1974). 210*210 On remand, the district court was instructed to \"determine the class and \nwho properly represents it.\" Id. at 917. However, the record reflects no further development \non the application for intervention; on remand, no hearing was sought or held. \nFor approximately the next two years, the Caddo Parish school system operated under the \nCommittee's desegregation plan without further legal proceedings. On July 20, 1976, the \nCitizens Advisory Committee, a group appointed to oversee the implementation of the 1973 \nplan, filed a report with the district court indicating several areas in which the parish had not \nmet the requirements established by the plan. That report recommended a one-year \nextension of the court order directing compliance with the 1973 Committee desegregation \nscheme. After examining data on the system's progress submitted by the School Board, \nJudge Scott appointed a Special Master \"for the specific purpose of investigating, \nexamining and producing evidence to enable the Court to determine the degree of \nconformity achieved by the Caddo Parish School Board in satisfying the conditions and \nprovisions of the [1973] plan ....\" \nIn September 1976, the School Board filed a motion with the district court asking for a \ndeclaration that the Caddo Parish school system was unitary and for dismissal of this \naction. Opposing this motion, the United States stated that any declaration of unitary status \nprior to the completion of the Special Master's duties would be premature. Deposition \ntestimony was taken before the Special Master on November 8 and 9, 1976. The plaintiffs—\nthrough counsel William Jefferson—also filed a memorandum in opposition to the School \nBoard's motion.[7] On December 30, 1977, Judge Scott found that the \"former state-imposed \ndual system has been completely eradicated\" and declared the Caddo Parish school \nsystem \"a unitary system.\" The judgment rendered that day dismissed the suit. \n\nNeither the United States nor the private plaintiffs appealed from this decision, but on \nJanuary 11, 1978, the government moved to amend the district court's judgment and \nfindings, claiming procedural irregularities in the proceedings held by the Special Master \nand substantive deficiencies in the determination that a unitary status had been achieved. \nSignificantly, none of the original plaintiffs indicated any opposition to the finding that the \nsystem was unitary or to the dismissal of the action. In July 1978, the School Board \nrequested that the district court lift the requirement of a faculty ratio of 50 percent white and \n50 percent black.[8] Again, only the United States filed in opposition to the School Board's \nrequest for partial relief. \nOn August 16, 1979, Judge Scott recused himself and the case was transferred to its third \ndistrict judge, Judge Stagg. \nOn June 3, 1980, following a status conference held the previous day, Judge Stagg entered \na minute order which provided in part: \n\"If the original plaintiffs still have a viable interest in this case, their counsel should contact \nthe court, in writing, within thirty (30) days of this order. If the plaintiffs' counsel does not \nrespond, this court will consider that the plaintiffs acquiesce in having their interests \nrepresented by the United States as plaintiff-intervenor.\" \nCopies of this notice were mailed to all past and present attorneys of record, including \nJesse Stone, Margrett Ford, Murphy Bell, and William Jefferson. While responses were \nreceived, in one form or another, from several former plaintiffs' representatives, none came \nforward to indicate a viable interest in the case or to object to proceeding 211*211 with the \nUnited States as plaintiff-intervenor.[9] \nAt this point, the United States and the Caddo Parish School Board entered into \nnegotiations in an attempt to arrive at a settlement. At no point in the course of these \nnegotiations, which lasted for almost a year, did any of the plaintiffs or their counsel attempt \nto participate. In February, March, and April 1981, numerous public meetings were held \nthroughout the community to inform the citizens about various desegregation approaches \nand to obtain community input.[10]Representatives of the Justice Department met with \nnumerous black civic leaders and received input from black citizen and parent groups. The \nnegotiation process culminated on May 5, 1981, with the signing of a settlement agreement \nbetween the United States and the School Board. Two days later, pursuant to a joint motion \nof the parties, the district court entered a consent degree which embodied that agreement. \nJudge Stagg's order approving the consent decree directed the clerk of the court to provide \nfor public notice of the terms of the decree. The consent decree was published in its entirety \nin both local newspapers and was covered by the three local television stations. The district \ncourt also set aside a ten-day period in which \"interested parties\" could file written \nobjections to the decree. Within the specified time period, the court received thirteen \nobjections, one of which was filed by June Phillips, appellant herein. The objection Ms. \nPhillips raised was confined to the failure of the decree to provide \"enrichment programs\" \nfor black students at many of the district's elementary schools. \n\nOn May 22, 1981, four days after the period for filing objections had expired, Ms. Phillips \nfiled a motion to intervene individually and on behalf of a class of black children in the \nCaddo Parish school system and their parents. Her petition alleged numerous deficiencies \nin the pupil assignment plan contained in the consent decree and requested the district \ncourt to set aside the decree. On May 27, Ms. Phillips filed a first supplemental motion to \nintervene. On June 8, she filed her second supplemental motion to intervene. That same \nday the United States and the School Board separately filed responses to the objections to \nthe consent decree, and memoranda opposing Ms. Phillips' attempt to intervene. \nOn June 17, 1981, the district court entered a memorandum ruling denying Ms. Phillips' \nmotion to intervene. Judge Stagg found her proposed intervention both untimely and \nwithout new issues that had not previously been considered by the School Board and the \nUnited States. On July 2, the district court overruled all objections to the consent decree. \nMs. Phillips appeals from the denial of her intervention and the rejection of her objection to \nthe consent decree. \nA PRELIMINARY ISSUE: THE PARTIES TO THE \nCONSENT DECREE \nAccording to the district court, Ms. Phillips sought intervenor status both individually and as \na representative of a class for the purpose of setting aside a consent decree negotiated by \nand agreed upon by only two parties, the United States and the Caddo Parish School \nBoard. In its memorandum ruling denying Ms. Phillips' intervention, 212*212 the court found \nthat \"this action, in its present posture, is not in fact a class action.\"[11] The court reasoned \nthat the action brought by the private plaintiffs, despite allegations of a \"class\" status, had \nnever been certified as a class action, that prior to June 1980 the original plaintiffs had not \ntaken an \"active role in this litigation for some time,\" and that none of these plaintiffs or their \ncounsel responded within the prescribed time period to the minute entry of June 3, 1980. \nThe uncertain nature of the private plaintiffs' role in the later years of this litigation, \nhighlighted by a complete failure to reestablish their participation through the order of June \n3, resulted in a dismissal of the claims of the class members. Therefore, the settlement \nnegotiations and the resulting consent decree were the efforts of two parties, the School \nBoard on one side and the United States—pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2—on the other. \nThe district court correctly viewed this action as one involving only two parties, and not as a \nclass action, after July 3, 1980.[12] From the outset of this litigation, the status of the private \nplaintiffs as representatives of a class was uncertain. Although the original complaint \ncontained allegations made on behalf of a class pursuant to former Rule 23(a)(3), it was just \nover a year later that Rule 23 was amended to include a mandatory requirement of class \ncertification.[13] Rule 23(c)(1), effective July 1, 1966, provided that \"[a]s soon as practicable \nafter the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by \norder whether it is to be so maintained,\" and the order of the Supreme Court accompanying \nthe 1966 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure explained that the \namendments \n\"shall govern all proceedings in actions brought [after July 1, 1966] and also in all further \nproceedings in actions then pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of the court \n\ntheir application in a particular action then pending would not be feasible or would work \ninjustice, in which event the former procedure applies.\" 383 U.S. 1031 (1966). \nThis Court has held amended Rule 23 to apply to actions that were filed before the effective \ndate of the amendments, Alvarez v. Pan American Life Insurance Company, 375 F.2d 992, \n993 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 827, 88 S.Ct. 74, 19 L.Ed.2d 82 (1967), and we have \nstated more generally \"that to the maximum extent possible, the amended Rules should be \ngiven retroactive application.\" Atlantis Development Corporation v. United States, 379 F.2d \n818, 823 (5th Cir. 213*2131967). Despite the general retroactive applicability of the \namendments to Rule 23, the record in this case indicates that no class certification in \naccordance with Rule 23(c)(1) was ever requested or ordered. Thus, the true nature of the \nclass was never judicially ascertained. \nA series of actions in the early 1970's further depicted the unsettled nature of the purported \nclass. In 1973, an apparent \"split\" developed between the interests and goals of the named \nrepresentatives and those of the lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. This \ndivergence of interests ultimately led to the named plaintiffs' withdrawing the NAACP \nlawyers as counsel and to the withdrawal of objections to the 1973 Committee plan \npreviously filed by one of those lawyers. Yet, contemporaneously, Margrett Ford (one of the \nNAACP lawyers) moved the district court to add additional parents and children in Caddo \nParish as party plaintiffs. In denying this latter motion, the district court took note that Ms. \nFord was the only attorney sponsoring the motion, and the judge warned that \"[a]dequate \nand proper representation of plaintiffs cannot be assured by divided counsel.\" \nIt became apparent that this \"rift\" was more than a disagreement among counsel when \nmany of the same school children and their parents who had sought to become additional \nparty plaintiffs filed a motion to intervene in November 1973. The complaint attached to the \nmotion for intervention alleged that the 1973 Committee desegregation plan—not objected \nto by the original plaintiffs—was unconstitutional because it maintained one-race schools \nwithin the parish. Although intervention was denied by the district court, this Court vacated \nthat judgment and expressly directed the district court on remand to \"determine the class \nand who properly represents it.\" Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d at 917. The \nuncertain nature of the class prompted this Court to state: \n\"Thus we have an unusual contest between black groups represented by different counsel, \nsome of whom were originally associated together when this suit was first filed, and we \ncannot determine on the record before us who most properly represents the rights of the \nblack community in Caddo Parish.\" Id. \nDespite this indication of concern over the undefined group of plaintiffs loosely constituting \nthe \"class,\" class certification, or definition, was not pursued when the case was remanded \nto the district court. \nFrom the date of our 1974 opinion in Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, supra, until the \nfiling of the objections to the 1981 consent decree—a period of over six years— the black \ncitizens of Caddo Parish were heard from, either through the original named plaintiffs or \notherwise, only once.[14] Ms. Phillips acknowledges this in her petition for intervention when \nshe states, \"From July 20, 1973 to July 3, 1980, The Class which plaintiff seeks to represent \n\nwas virtually unrepresented in these proceedings.\" When Judge Scott entered his order \nfinding the school system unitary, the plaintiffs did not file an appeal or attempt to have that \nfinding amended by the district court. Moreover, they did not join in the government's motion \nto amend the findings and set aside the declaration of unitary status. Similarly, the plaintiffs \ndid not oppose the School Board's motion for relief from the faculty racial percentage \nrequirements, nor did they join the motion of the United States, which sought to postpone \nconsideration of this issue. \nWhen this case was assigned to Judge Stagg in August 1979, the only plaintiff who had \nactively participated over the previous two and one-half years was the United States. In \nJune 1980, following a status conference which included a discussion of \"the present status \nof the plaintiffs and their proper representation,\" the court entered the following minute \norder, a copy of which was sent to all counsel of record, past and present: \n214*214 \"If the original plaintiffs still have a viable interest in this case, their counsel should \ncontact the court, in writing, within thirty (30) days of this order. If the plaintiffs' counsel does \nnot respond, this court will consider that the plaintiffs acquiesce in having their interests \nrepresented by the United States as plaintiff-intervenor.\" \nNone of the plaintiffs or their counsel expressed an interest in participating in any further \nproceedings in this action. In addition, no objections were lodged to proceeding with the \nUnited States as plaintiff-intervenor. \nThe failure of the plaintiffs and their counsel to affirmatively assert an interest in this action \nwithin the prescribed time period, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the \"class\" \naspect of the suit over the preceding six years and the lack of any class certification, \nwarranted the district court's dismissal of the claims of the class for failure to prosecute. It is \nwell-recognized that a district court has inherent power to order, sua sponte, the dismissal \nof an action for want of prosecution. Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-33, 82 \nS.Ct. 1386, 1388-1390, 8 L.Ed.2d 734, 737-38 (1962); Rogers v. Kroger Co., 669 F.2d 317, \n319-20 (5th Cir.1982); see 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil §§ \n2369-70 (1971). Although infrequent, dismissals for failure to prosecute of suits \ndenominated as class actions are proper in the federal courts. See Partridge v. St. Louis \nJoint Stock Land Bank, 130 F.2d 281 (8th Cir.1942); National Hairdressers' & \nCosmetologists' Ass'n v. Philad Co., 4 F.R.D. 106 (D.Del.1944). Here, the record strongly \nsupports the district court's determination that the plaintiffs had lost interest in pursuing this \nlitigation, and that they had no objection to the United States, as plaintiff-intervenor, seeking \nfurther desegregation of the parish schools. \nOn appeal, Ms. Phillips asserts that the district court failed to comply with the requirement of \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) that notice of the proposed dismissal of a class action be provided to all \nmembers of the class.[15] In the present circumstances, no such notice was required. Rule \n23(e) was enacted \"to assure that any person whose rights would be affected by a \ndismissal or compromise has the opportunity to contest the proposed action.\" 7A C. Wright \n& A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 1797 at 234 (1972). However, the \nspecial prophylactic function of Rule 23(e) is not applicable to all forms of dismissal. For \nexample, when the dismissal is involuntary—as it was here—and it \"could not involve \ncollusion or benefit the representative plaintiffs at the expense of the remaining class \n\nmembers, the protection afforded by giving notice to the absentees is not required.\" Id. at \n235; see Laventhall v. General Dynamics Corp., 91 F.R.D. 208, 210 (E.D.Mo.1981) (Rule \n23(e) does not apply to involuntary dismissal of an uncertified class action). In Partridge v. \nSt. Louis Joint Stock Land Bank, supra, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the trial court's dismissal \nof a class action for failure to prosecute, even though notice of the dismissal was not \nprovided to the nonparty class members. The suit in Partridge had been pending on the \ndistrict court's docket for nine years, with the plaintiffs receiving a long series of \ncontinuances. When the court ordered the action set for trial—giving plaintiffs full notice \nthereof—counsel for the named plaintiff again moved orally for a continuance. The suit was \ndismissed for failure to prosecute, even though the named party was the representative of a \nlarge \"class of persons.\" 130 F.2d at 286. The Eighth Circuit noted that \"the court has the \nduty to see to it that even a class suit shall be prosecuted with due diligence,\" and \nconcluded that Rule 23(c), the predecessor to current Rule 23(e), was \"not applicable to \ndismissal for failure to prosecute under the circumstances here presented.\" Id. \n215*215 While the Partridge decision has been criticized for not recognizing that the failure \nto prosecute may indicate a lack of interest only by the named representatives, see, e.g., 7A \nC. Wright & A. Miller, supra, § 1797 at 236; Comment, Involuntary Dismissals of Class \nActions, 40 U.Chi.L.Rev. 783, 791-92 (1973), the concerns expressed by the commentators \nare ameliorated by two factors present here. First, the United States was actively \nparticipating in the litigation as a party plaintiff. Thus, even a complete and final dismissal of \nall private plaintiffs would not mean that school desegregation would no longer be pursued \nin Caddo Parish. As the district court recognized, 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2 empowers the \nUnited States to intervene and to seek \"the same relief as if it had instituted the action.\" This \nauthorization continues even though the private plaintiffs to the action have been removed, \n\"so long as [the government's] participation serves the statutory purpose.\"[16] Pasadena City \nBoard of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 430, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2702, 49 L.Ed.2d 599, \n605 (1976). \nMore importantly, we believe that the district court's dismissal of the claims of the private \nplaintiffs, despite being predicated on a failure to prosecute, was not an adjudication on the \nmerits. Therefore, the failure of the district court to notify all members of the class of the \nproposed dismissal did not allow the named representatives to sacrifice or unduly \ncompromise the interests of the unnamed class members. While Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) \npresumptively makes an involuntary dismissal for failure to prosecute an adjudication upon \nthe merits, see Weissinger v. United States, 423 F.2d 795, 798-99 (5th Cir.1970) (en banc), \nthat same rule provides that the district court may direct otherwise in its order of \ndismissal.[17]Here, however, no formal order of dismissal was filed. Thus, where we are \nconfronted with the dismissal of a class suit without the entry of an order of dismissal, we \ndecline to merely automatically imply the severe penalty of a dismissal with prejudice, and, \nrather, believe it necessary to examine the circumstances surrounding the termination of the \nclass action, as well as the pertinent orders and rulings of the district court, to determine \nwhether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.[18] 216*216 The necessity for this inquiry \nis particularly acute in this situation where, in addition to the above factors, the nature of the \nclass has gone undefined throughout the course of the litigation. \nSeveral factors lead to our conclusion that this dismissal was without prejudice. First, the \nminute entry of June 3, 1980, did not inform counsel that a failure to respond would result in \n\nan adjudication on the merits; to the contrary, the only penalty indicated was that the private \nparties would accede to the United States pursuing the action as plaintiff-intervenor. Instead \nof indicating a dismissal prejudicial to the filing of future desegregation actions, this order \nsuggests that the plaintiffs were given thirty days to continue or withdraw from this action \nonly. The June 3 order did not even hint that the district court was contemplating \npermanently removing an ambiguously defined class of private plaintiffs from the filing of \nfurther desegregation suits in Caddo Parish. Second, the district court's memorandum ruling \ndenying Ms. Phillips' motion to intervene was similarly devoid of any suggestion that the \ndismissal of the class suit was with prejudice. \nThe circumstances surrounding the dismissal of the private plaintiffs also indicate a \ndismissal without prejudice. The prejudicial dismissal for failure to prosecute of a purported \nclass action, particularly one involving issues of system-wide school desegregation, should \nonly follow an inquiry into the relationship between the class representatives and the \nunnamed class members. Here, the class itself was never defined with any particularity, \nmaking a determination of the significance of the failure to prosecute problematic at best. In \nfact, we note that under the former Rule 23(a)(3), the basis for the class allegations in the \noriginal complaint, a judgment was binding on only the parties of record. See 3B J. Moore & \nJ. Kennedy, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 23.10[7] (1982). Thus, if the class allegations here \nare treated as having been made pursuant to that Rule, the district court's dismissal would \nonly bind the named parties to this action. \nFurther, the law in this Circuit in regard to dismissals with prejudice for failure to prosecute \nhas been well-settled on one point: such dismissals are reserved for only the most \negregious of cases, where there is \"`a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the \nplaintiff,' ... and where lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice.\" Rogers \nv. Kroger Co., 669 F.2d at 320 (citations omitted); see Gray v. Fidelity Acceptance \nCorp., 634 F.2d 226, 227 (5th Cir.1981); Boazman v. Economics Laboratory, Inc., 537 F.2d \n210, 212 (5th Cir.1976). The conduct of the named plaintiffs here, although clearly pointing \nto a lack of interest in the prosecution of the action, hardly rises to the level of contumacious \nor egregious conduct. Moreover, sanctions less severe than a dismissal with prejudice were \nplainly available and desirable in this instance. We believe the district court, fully cognizant \nof the extreme circumstances 217*217 required to enter a dismissal with prejudice for failure \nto prosecute, opted for just such a less severe remedy in the form of a dismissal of the class \naction without prejudice. Given the hesitancy of this Court to endorse prejudicial dismissals \nfor failure to prosecute and the circumstances under which this dismissal occurred, this \ninterpretation of the district court's action is appropriate. We hold that the dismissal of the \nclass action was without prejudice.[19] \nThis resolution clarifies the disposition of Ms. Phillips' claim that the district court failed to \nprovide notice of the settlement between the United States and the School Board to the \naffected nonparty class members. Since the district court had dismissed the class action as \nof July 3, 1980, there was no class to notify when the settlement was reached on May 5, \n1981. Once properly dismissed, the members of a former class suit no longer fall under the \numbrella of the Rule 23(e) notice requirement. See Pearson v. Ecological Science \nCorp., 522 F.2d 171, 177 (5th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 912, 96 S.Ct. 1508, 47 \nL.Ed.2d 762 (1976)(after determination that class action is improper under Rule 23(c)(1), \nnotice requirements of Rule 23(e) do not apply). Furthermore, notice of the consent \n\ndecree was provided, and it was precisely that notice and opportunity to file written \nobjections which brought Ms. Phillips into this dispute. In this type of class action, the \n\"mechanics of the notice process are left to the discretion of the district court subject only to \nthe broad `reasonableness' standards imposed by due process.\" Fowler v. Birmingham \nNews Co., 608 F.2d 1055, 1059 (5th Cir.1979).[20] Ms. Phillips identifies no shortcomings in \nthe method of notice employed by the district court; her general, conclusionary allegations \nwill not suffice. \nTo complete the picture, we again note that Ms. Phillips attempted to intervene to set aside \na consent decree negotiated and agreed upon by the only two parties to the suit, the United \nStates and the Caddo Parish School Board. Neither Ms. Phillips nor her fellow citizens of \nCaddo Parish were parties to the decree entered in 1981. It is therefore axiomatic that Ms. \nPhillips— not having been a party to the decree—is not bound by res judicata to the terms \nof the decree. See United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., 517 F.2d 826, 845 \n(5th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1684, 48 L.Ed.2d 187 (1976); Rodriguez \nv. East Texas Motor Freight, 505 F.2d 40, 65 (5th Cir.1974), vacated on other grounds,431 \nU.S. 395, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 52 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977); United States v. Louisiana,90 F.R.D. 358, \n362-63 (E.D.La.1981) (three-judge court), aff'd, 669 F.2d 314 (5th Cir.1982); United States \nv. Board of Education, 88 F.R.D. 679, 683 and n. 6 (N.D.Ill. 1981). \nTHE MOTION TO INTERVENE \nMs. Phillips sought intervention under Rule 24(a)(2), intervention of right, and in the \nalternative under Rule 24(b)(2), permissive intervention.[21] The denial of a motion 218*218 to \nintervene of right is appealable, Weiser v. White, 505 F.2d 912, 916-18 (5th Cir.), cert. \ndenied, 421 U.S. 993, 95 S.Ct. 1998, 44 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975); however, the denial of a \nmotion for permissive intervention is not appealable unless there is an abuse of \ndiscretion. Woolen v. Surtran Taxicabs, Inc., 684 F.2d 324 (5th Cir.1982). Accordingly, we \nmust review the merits of the claim of intervention to determine whether or not the district \ncourt's order denying intervention is appealable. Weiser, 505 F.2d at 916. \nThe district court found Ms. Phillips' motion to intervene deficient because it was untimely \nand because it failed to raise new issues that had not previously been considered by the \nparties to the consent decree. An application for intervention under either Rule 24(a) or Rule \n24(b) must be \"timely.\" NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2603, 37 \nL.Ed.2d 648 (1973); Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 263 (5th Cir.1977). \nTimeliness \"is not a word of exactitude or of precisely measurable dimensions,\" McDonald \nv. E.J. Lavino Co., 430 F.2d 1065, 1074 (5th Cir.1970); instead, it is a measure \"to be \ndetermined from all the circumstances.\" NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. at 366, 93 S.Ct. at \n2603. As such, its determination in any given case is an exercise committed to the sound \ndiscretion of the district court, subject to reversal by an appellate court only for an abuse of \nthat discretion. Id. at 366, 93 S.Ct. at 2603; United States v. United States Steel Corp., 548 \nF.2d 1232, 1235 (5th Cir. 1977). In United States v. Marion County School District, 590 F.2d \n146, 148-49 (5th Cir.1979), we discussed the elements of the timeliness requirement within \nthe context of a school desegregation action: \n\"Timeliness is a function of the relative prejudice to the existing parties and the would-be \nintervenor. The district court, in exercising its discretion to weigh the relative prejudice to \n\neach, must put into the balance against the movant its prior opportunities to assert its \nposition and its protection through representation by the existing parties. In weighing \npossible prejudice to the existing parties the court must consider what has happened as a \nresult of the movant's failure to apply for intervention as soon as it knew or reasonably \nshould have known of its interest in the case.\" \nSee also Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 264-66. \nAn assessment of these factors in this case leads to the conclusion that Ms. Phillips' \nproposed intervention was untimely on its face. From the filing of this action in 1965 until \nMay 22, 1981, the date of her motion to intervene, Ms. Phillips made no effort to intervene \nto assert either her views or those of a purported class. Although her petition to intervene \nasserts the inadequacy of \"most of the actions of [the district court] since the original filings \nof this suit,\" she remained conspicuously silent through almost sixteen years of legal \nproceedings and negotiations. Ms. Phillips also assails the 1973 Committee desegregation \nplan for failing to benefit the class which she seeks to represent, yet she waited eight years \nto voice this objection. Similarly, when the district court declared the Caddo Parish school \nsystem unitary in 1977, Ms. Phillips neither attempted to intervene nor did she make any \neffort to join the United States in seeking to amend the judgment. During the early months \nof 1981, when community meetings were held throughout the parish to discuss \ndesegregation proposals, the record again reflects no attempt to intervene. It was not until \nMay 22, 1981, fifteen days after the formal entry of the consent decree and four days after \nthe expiration of the period for filing objections to the decree, that Ms. Phillips moved to \nintervene in an effort to set aside the consent decree. \n219*219 Under circumstances evincing comparable delays in seeking intervention, this Court \nhas found such applications untimely. In United States v. Marion County School District, \nsupra, a school desegregation action originally brought by the United States in 1967, we \naffirmed the denial of two motions to intervene made by an organization of parents, the first \nof which was filed in 1977. In finding the 1977 petition for intervention to be untimely, we \nnoted that \n\"[the organization's] initial motion seeking the return of grades 7-12 to the Improve school \nwas filed ten years after the commencement of Marion County's school litigation, seven \nyears after the court-ordered removal of grades 9-12 from Improve, and four years after \nimplementation of the modified plan removing grades 7 and 8.\" 590 F.2d at 149. \nMore recently, we held untimely an attempt to intervene by the NAACP seven years after \nthe United States initiated litigation against the State of Louisiana over the desegregation of \nits higher education system. United States v. Louisiana, supra. There, the NAACP initially \nmoved to intervene only two years into the suit and, after the motion had been denied by \nthe district court, we remanded the case for a hearing on the motion to intervene, United \nStates v. Louisiana, 543 F.2d 1125 (5th Cir.1976). On remand, the intervention question \nwas not pursued, the NAACP having chosen instead to participate as amicus curiae. \nHowever, in 1981 the NAACP again moved to intervene, and this motion was denied \nbecause, inter alia, the NAACP had failed to satisfy the timeliness requirement of Rule 24. \n\"We cannot say, in view of the NAACP's great and undisputed delay—over four years—in \nadvancing the second motion that the order denying it was [an abuse of discretion].\" 669 \n\nF.2d at 315. See also United States v. Carroll County Board of Education, 427 F.2d 141, \n142 (5th Cir.1970). \nMs. Phillips' inordinate delay in seeking intervenor status is even less understandable when \nwe recognize that her role in the community probably kept her apprised of many of the \ndevelopments in this action. The record indicates that the United States subpoenaed Ms. \nPhillips to appear \"as a witness to assist the Government at counsel table during the taking \nof various depositions\" during the proceedings held by the Special Master in 1976. Thus, \nMs. Phillips was present during testimony and proceedings addressed to the question of the \nSchool Board's compliance with the 1973 Committee desegregation plan and, although she \nnow objects to that plan, she did not intervene either to modify that plan or to question the \nSchool Board's fulfillment of its objectives. Moreover, prior to these hearings the School \nBoard had moved for a declaration of unitary status, yet Ms. Phillips also did not intervene \nto oppose that motion. Furthermore, movant's first supplemental motion to intervene \nacknowledges that she had contact with one of the Justice Department lawyers \nrepresenting the United States in the settlement negotiations with the School Board. Her \nmotion states that this lawyer \"obtained input\" from her and that he \"held meetings in the \nBlack community to obtain input from the Black community.\" Thus, it appears likely that to \nan extent Ms. Phillips was apprised of the settlement efforts well before the entry of the \nconsent decree; yet, she made no effort to intervene at that point.[22] \n220*220 The issue of timeliness, according to Ms. Phillips, \"is at least partially linked to the \nquestion of adequate representation,\" Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306, 1321 (5th \nCir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1011, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66 L.Ed.2d 469 (1980), and, she argues, \nmust be determined here from the date the consent degree was signed. In her original \nmotion to intervene (and in her second supplemental and amended motion), Ms. Phillips \noffers no explanation whatever for her failure to seek intervention earlier. In her first \nsupplemental motion to intervene, she states that she did not learn of \"the contents of the \nConsent Decree until the week of May 11 to May 15, 1981.\"[23] She also states that she had \n\"presumed that the United States would represent the best interest\" of herself and the class \nshe seeks to represent, but that it did not in that the consent decree's terms were not what \nshe says they should have been. She offers no other reason for not seeking intervention \nsooner. She does not allege, directly or inferentially, that the United States or anyone else \nmisled her or members of the class she seeks to represent in any way, or that she (or the \n\"class\") was led to believe, or even did believe, that the consent decree would contain some \nparticular provision which it omitted, or that it would not include some particular provision \nwhich it did in fact contain. She does not allege that she, or the class she seeks to \nrepresent, was unaware of either the prolonged settlement negotiations, lasting for almost a \nyear, leading up to the consent decree, or of the numerous public meetings, held during \nFebruary, March, and April 1981, in reference thereto, or that she, or the \"class,\" was ever \nunaware of the status of the litigation and the conditions in the schools since a time well \nbefore 1973. \nAs applied to these circumstances it seems clear that Ms. Phillips \"knew or reasonably \nshould have known of [her] interest in the case\" long before she filed her petition to \nintervene. Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 264. As established in Stallworth, id., and Marion \nCounty, 590 F.2d at 149, the relevant time period for gauging the timeliness of an \napplication for intervention begins when the proposed intervenor knew or should have \n\nknown of his or her interest in the case; actual knowledge is not required. The premise of \nher position—that the 1981 decree was the first indication that her interests were not \nrepresented by any existing party and that she then became aware of her interest in the \ncase—is not supported by the record. The 1973 Committee desegregation plan, which Ms. \nPhillips claims failed to eliminate the remnants of the dual school system, has been in \noperation since the start of the 1973-74 school year. This scheme, an allegedly \nunconstitutional plan, was in place for eight years prior to the 1981 consent decree, without \nobjection from the original plaintiffs (or Ms. Phillips). During this period, Ms. Phillips surely \nknew of her interest in the case and, moreover, she should have known that the interest she \nnow asserts as applicant for intervention— the further desegregation of the parish \nschools—was not represented by the private 221*221plaintiffs. In addition, the United States \nwas also a party during the eight-year period, basically acceding to the implementation and \ncontinued operation of the 1973 scheme.[24] \nMs. Phillips further withheld from seeking intervention during the almost year-long \nnegotiations between the United States and the School Board, even though the \nnegotiations received publicity in the community, and meetings were held throughout the \nparish to discuss various desegregation proposals. We find it difficult to reconcile Ms. \nPhillips' attempted intervention after the parties had negotiated a settlement and the district \ncourt had entered a consent decree with any proper regard for the settlement process itself. \nWe fully recognize that \"school desegregation is one of the areas in which voluntary \nresolution is preferable to full litigation because the spirit of cooperation inherent in good \nfaith settlement is essential to the true long-range success of any desegregation \nremedy.\" Armstrong v. Board of School Directors, 616 F.2d 305, 318 (7th \nCir.1980); see United States v. Board of Education, 88 F.R.D. at 685. This statement is \nparticularly meaningful in the context of this seventeen-year litigation, which, after several \ntrips to this Court and the gradual exodus of the private parties, has culminated in a consent \ndecree agreed upon by the remaining parties and approved by the district court. \n\"Intervention after entry of a consent decree is reserved for exceptional cases.\" Alaniz v. \nTillie Lewis Foods, 572 F.2d 657, 659 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 837, 99 S.Ct. 123, \n58 L.Ed.2d 134 (1978). If Ms. Phillips is permitted to intervene at this late date to \ninterpose her views, we see little to prevent other nonparties from similarly coming forward \nto voice objections to the decree. More importantly, should Ms. Phillips' protests be \naccounted for, and the consent decree accordingly reformed, what would then preclude Ms. \nSmith or Mr. Jones or any other resident of the parish from intervening in opposition to the \nnew decree? \nUnder these circumstances, then, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion \nin ruling that Ms. Phillips' request for intervention was untimely.[25] \n A HEARING ON THE MOTION TO INTERVENE \n222*222\nThe district court denied Ms. Phillips' motion to intervene without holding an evidentiary \nhearing, despite a request for such a hearing in her original motion.[26]This Court has \nindicated generally that due process requires that proposed intervenors be provided a \nhearing prior to a ruling on their motions to intervene. See Adams v. Baldwin County Board \nof Education, 628 F.2d 895, 897 (5th Cir.1980); Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 \nF.2d at 917; Calhoun v. Cook, 487 F.2d 680, 683 (5th Cir. 1973). We do not retreat from \n\nthat position today. We do, however, believe that on the record before the district court Ms. \nPhillips' intervention was prima facie untimely, and as she tendered to the district court no \nfactual allegations which, if true, would establish the contrary, the district court was not \nobliged to hold an evidentiary hearing. See United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d at \n315; United States v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277, 280 (5th Cir.1978). \nCONCLUSION \nUnder the law of this Circuit, where intervention of right is properly denied and permissive \nintervention is denied without an abuse of discretion, the decision of the district court is not \nappealable and we must dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Weiser, 505 F.2d at \n916; 7A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 1923 at 629 (1972). \nAPPEAL DISMISSED. \n223*223 JERRE S. WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nI concur fully in the opinion of Judge Garwood for the majority of the Court. I add a few \nwords to express my own views as to the relationship between that majority opinion and \nJudge Goldberg's opinion in dissent. \nI feel great sympathy for the anguish which my brother Goldberg reveals in his dissenting \nopinion. I simply wish to state why I do not feel that same anguish although I, along with all \nthe members of the Court, is deeply concerned with enforcing the constitutional rights of \nminorities by eliminating racial discrimination in the public schools. \nJudge Goldberg himself emphasizes that this case has now dragged along for almost \neighteen years. There must be an opportunity to end such litigation some time. The critical \nquestion the Court had to deal with was whether that time had come in a detailed consent \ndecree acquiesced in by most members of the community, white and black, and agreed to \nby the School Board, by the federal district judge, and by the United States Department of \nJustice, and publicized so that all concerned persons could react to it. \nIt is well to point out also that there had been ample earlier opportunity to appellant and \nothers to participate in the judicial processes of this case. After our decision in Jones v. \nCaddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974), those persons concerned about \nthe racial integration of the Caddo Parish Schools took no further action to intervene. Rather \nthan this lack of action being \"inexplicable\", we obviously must assume that the failure to \ntake further action and to allow the schools to continue in their then present form was a \nvoluntary act on the part of those who had pursued the appeal to this Court. Phillips or \nothers could have acted then. Further there is later a period of several years during which \nappellant and others could have sought intervention when the district court held the school \nsystem unitary—a decision set aside on petition of the United States Department of Justice. \nBut the most critical time involves the development of the current district court order which \nis here appealed. I emphasize that the posture of the case as it comes to this Court is one \nin which every attempt has been made to be fair to everyone, a final order has been \n\nentered, and now someone wants to reopen the case to start over again. Phillips was fully \naware of the proposed settlement and submitted comments. The record reveals that Phillips \nhad earlier been a participant in various aspects of the case. With the dominant forces in \nthe community, both white and black, seemingly willing to accept the proposed settlement \nand the United States Department of Justice participating in the settlement, Phillips had no \nright to assume at that late hour that she could be confident that whatever suggestions she \nmade would automatically become part of that order. The time for her intervention was of \nnecessity the time while the proposed settlement was still pending. There was ample time \nthen. If she had moved to intervene at that time, the law is clear that she would have been \nentitled to a hearing and a specific decision on her motion to intervene. But she waited until \nthe matter was all over, until an eighteen year case was finally concluded, and then said \nthat because she did not like the settlement she wanted to intervene, have it thrown out, \nand start over again with a class action. Her motion to intervene under these circumstances \nwas not timely, and we properly so hold. \nFinally, there should be a general observation. No such settlement can ever be expected to \nbe satisfactory to everyone in a community. But, as I stated earlier, there must be a way to \nend these cases even though not everyone is satisfied. This record reveals that the district \ncourt with great care, as described in the majority opinion, brought about the final \ndisposition of this case. There can properly be anguish for those who do not agree with the \nsettlement. But there could also be anguish felt for this troubled community if after the many \nyears of these proceedings and finally 224*224 a settlement, those who do disagree with it \ncan upset the careful action of the community, the court, and the United States Government \nand start over again. \nWhat may be the rights of appellant and others in a new and independent suit brought by \nthem is not now before us. But the motion to intervene to set aside the settlement between \nthe Caddo Parish School Board and the United States Department of Justice, approved by \nthe district court, was not timely. The time for intervention was before settlement, not after. \nGOLDBERG, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nThis is a ghost story, a tale better suited for campfires and dark, stormy nights than for the \npages of the Federal Reporter. It is a story of a disembodied class of black students of \nCaddo Parish seeking vainly to vindicate their constitutional right to attend desegregated \nschools. It is a story of the Fifth Circuit, refusing to grant even a hearing to the proposed \nintervenor-class representative, acting more like a child whistling in the dark than a court of \njustice, afraid to look out the window and see if the mournful cries actually emanate from \nsomebody or are just the products of a frightened imagination. \nThe judicial efforts to desegregate the Caddo Parish schools began some eighteen years \nago. Despite the fact that the action was originally filed as a class action, and despite the \nfact that a group of potential intervenors sought to represent a class of black plaintiffs, no \nclass has ever been certified. Accordingly, the black students and parents of the Caddo \nParish schools, the phantom class haunting this lawsuit, have had to rely on surrogates to \npresent their views. After the Justice Department and Caddo Parish negotiated a consent \ndecree, appellant-intervenor June Phillips concluded that this virtual representation \n\namounted to virtual neglect and attempted to intervene on behalf of the ghost class of black \nstudents and parents. \nThe trial court below denied the motion to intervene without even granting a hearing, \nbecause it determined from the pleadings that the motion was untimely and that the \ninterests of the proposed intervenor were adequately represented by the Justice \nDepartment. The majority today holds that the request to intervene was so manifestly \nuntimely that it did not merit that most fundamental procedural device, a hearing. It appears \nto me, however, that June Phillips has made claims that, if true, would show that her \ninterests and the interests of the class she hopes to represent are not adequately \nrepresented by the Justice Department, and that her motion to intervene was timely. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Phillips deserves at least a hearing on her motion and I \nrespectfully dissent. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nA. Factual and Procedural Background \nI pause briefly to discuss the background of this case, not because I believe there is any \nshortcoming in the thorough and fair history presented in the majority opinion, but simply \nbecause some of the events that occurred have a hidden side that becomes visible when \nviewed from the perspective of the ghost class of black students and parents. Because the \nruling that is the subject of this appeal is the denial of a hearing, I have no findings of fact to \nuse in presenting this background. Accordingly, I will take an approach similar to that used \nwhen reviewing a motion for summary judgment and view the facts and inferences in the \nlight most favorable to the appellant, Phillips. \nThe first inference I shall draw is that there exists within the confines of Caddo Parish a \nclass of black students and parents desiring the maximal amount of desegregation required \nby law. Several factors support this modest assumption. First, Phillips herself claims she \nwould represent such a class. Second, the suit was initially brought on behalf of such a \nclass. Finally, parties purporting to represent such a class attempted to intervene in late \n1973. Given the procedural posture of this appeal and the fact that never in the history of \nthis lawsuit has the trial court held any kind of 225*225 hearing to determine the composition \nand interests of the plaintiff class, this first inference seems quite justified. \nViewed in the light of this modest assumption, the history of this case takes on an \nunpleasant character. The record shows three separate occasions when groups initially \nrepresenting the interests of the phantom class changed their positions. The original named \nplaintiffs seemed at first to represent the interests of the phantom class. In mid-1973, \nhowever, the original named plaintiffs acquiesced in a \"desegregation\" plan that allowed the \ncontinued operation of thirty-four one-race or predominantly one-race schools. This was the \nfirst lapse in representation of the phantom class. \nAfter this first lapse, additional named plaintiffs sought to intervene to press for more \nenergetic desegregation. The trial court denied the motion for intervention and the would-be \nintervenors appealed to this Court. We ruled that the district court should have held a \n\nhearing on the intervention motion. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914 (5th \nCir.1974). Inexplicably, after their victory in this Court, the would-be intervenors did nothing. \nAs the majority notes, \"on remand, no hearing was sought or held.\" This was the second \nlapse in representation. \nThere was still hope for the phantom class, however, because the Justice Department was \nstill participating in the case. From the time the Justice Department entered the case in the \nmid-1960's until early 1981, the Justice Department was undisputedly a vigorous advocate \nof the interests of the phantom class. The Justice Department consistently objected to \nexcessive numbers of mostly one-race schools, premature declarations that the vestiges of \nsegregation had been eliminated, and attempts to hinder desegregation of the faculty. In \nearly 1981, however, the Justice Department apparently adopted a different approach to \nschool desegregation cases and negotiated a consent decree that would leave forty-seven \npercent of the black students in one-race or predominantly one-race schools.[1] Once again, \nit seems that the representation of the interests of the phantom class has lapsed. Because \nrepresentation of interests by the government is one of the key issues in this appeal, I will \naddress this point at greater length below. \nB. Issues on Appeal \nThis case is rife with disturbing issues. The most troubling aspect of the majority's result is \nthe fact that Phillips' motion to intervene was denied without a hearing.[2]In the process of \ndenying the appellant a hearing, the majority makes nominal obeisance to the many cases \nof this Circuit stating the clear necessity for a hearing. As we stated in Adams v. Baldwin \nCounty Board of Education, 628 F.2d 895, 897 (5th Cir.1980): \nWhen parents move to intervene in school desegregation cases, the \nimportant 226*226 constitutional rights at stake demand a scrupulous regard for due process \nconsiderations, Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974). This \nCourt has determined that intervention, rather than a separate action, is the proper vehicle \nfor parents claiming inadequate representation to assert their rights. Denial of a plea in \nintervention, therefore, often will deprive those parties of their only opportunity to be heard. \nConsequently, we adhere to our earlier decisions requiring the district court to conduct an \nevidentiary hearing and to enter findings based upon an adequate record. Jones v. Caddo \nParish School Board, 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974); Calhoun v. Cook, 487 F.2d 680 (5th \nCir.1973). See also United States v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277 (5th \nCir.1978). \nThe two cases upon which the majority relies to deny the motion without a hearing at most \nstand for the proposition that a hearing is not required when \"it is more than clear that \nappellants are not entitled to intervene.\" United States v. Perry County Board of \nEducation, 567 F.2d 277, 280 (5th Cir.1978). See also United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d \n314 (5th Cir.1982) (trial court denied NAACP's motion to intervene, this Court remanded for \nhearing but none was held, and after four years of inactivity NAACP renewed its motion to \nintervene; no hearing on timeliness was necessary on those facts). Accordingly, I believe \nthat the appellant's burden to show that she was entitled to a hearing is minimal—I believe \nthat under our cases she need establish only that it is not clear that she is not entitled to \n\nintervention. Stated positively, I believe that all Phillips must show to earn a hearing is a \nmere possibility that she is entitled to intervention. \nIntervention of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2) has four requirements: (1) the application \nmust be timely; (2) the movant must have an interest in the case; (3) disposition of the case \nwould impair the movant's interest; (4) the movant's interests are not adequately \nrepresented by the existing parties. The trial court denied intervention because the motion \nwas not timely and because the movant's interests were adequately represented by the \nJustice Department. The majority agreed that the motion was untimely, and so did not fully \ndiscuss the issue of adequacy of representation. \nBecause I disagree with the district court's disposition of the motion, I must address both \ntimeliness and adequacy of representation. Because the issue of timeliness \"is at least \npartially linked to the question of adequate representation,\" Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d \n1306, 1321 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1011, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66 L.Ed.2d 469 (1980), I \nshall discuss adequacy of representation first, and then address timeliness. \nII. ADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION \nIt makes no sense to let a movant intervene if that movant will add nothing to the judicial \nprocess. Our adversarial system presumes that a party with a particular interest will put \nforth all reasonable arguments advancing that interest. These two principles together \nproduce the idea that a movant may not intervene of right if his or her interests are \nadequately represented by the existing parties. In application this simple proposition \nbecomes complicated. First, it is not always clear whether the various parties represent \nsame interests. Second, to the extent the same interests are represented, that \nrepresentation may not be adequate. Third, when the government is a party, the movant \nhas a heavier burden in showing inadequacy of representation. I will address each of these \npoints in turn. \nA. Identity of Interests \nThe first step in determining adequacy of representation is to determine whether the \ninterests of the movant are already represented by a party to the litigation. This is not a yes-\nno question. On occasion the answer may be clear, because the interests are either \nidentical, as in the case of derivative rights, or totally adverse. A more troubling case occurs \nwhen interests are similar. See 7A C. Wright & A. Miller, 227*227 Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 1909 (1972). Such appears to be the case here. \nTo determine the degree of similarity of interests, I must first, of course, determine what the \nvarious interests are. An interest could be defined broadly, such as an interest in fairness, \nor more narrowly, in terms of specific remedies. Interests should not be defined broadly in \nseeking to measure adequacy of representation, because very often an intervenor is \ninterested in the type of relief to be provided. Suppose two groups were both interested in \nschool desegregation and both wanted to abolish de jure segregation, but one group \nwanted to institute a freedom of choice plan while the other group wanted busing. It would \nbe ludicrous to claim that both groups had the same interests because both wanted \n\ndesegregation. The only sensible analysis is that the two groups have different interests \nbecause their ultimate goals are different. \nThis Circuit has repeatedly held that different final objectives constitute different interests for \nthe purpose of determining adequacy of representation. See Woolen v. Surtran Taxicabs, \nInc., 684 F.2d 324, 333 (5th Cir.1982) (in antitrust suits when one group seeks injunctive \nrelief and another group seeks damages, interests are different); International Tank \nTerminals v. M/V Acadia Forest, 579 F.2d 964, 967 (5th Cir. 1978) (quoting Commonwealth \nof Virginia v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 542 F.2d 214, 216 (4th Cir.1976)) (identity of \ninterest determined by \"ultimate objective\"); Cohn v. EEOC, 569 F.2d 909, 911 (5th \nCir.1978) (interest of movant in reducing range of sanctions for contempt citation different \nfrom interest of EEOC in contesting contempt in first place). \nIronically, one of the clearest statements of this principal is Jones v. Caddo Parish School \nBoard, 499 F.2d 914 (1974). In facts obviously similar to the present appeal, movants \nattempted to intervene representing a class of black plaintiffs who objected to the excessive \nnumber of predominantly one-race schools. The party-plaintiff, as I have mentioned, \nacquiesced in the committee plan. This Court stated that movants who claimed they \n\"represent[ed] a class who desire the achievement of greater desegregation than is \nnecessary to satisfy plaintiffs,\" id. at 917, should be given a hearing. That is both literally \nand figuratively this case. The movant here desires a reduction in the number of one-race \nschools in Caddo Parish. The Justice Department, as evidenced by the consent decree, did \nnot share that interest. Once again, we have in Caddo Parish \"a class who desire the \nachievement of greater desegregation than is necessary to satisfy plaintiffs.\" Once again, \nthe case should be remanded for a hearing. \nB. Adequacy of Representation \nThe second inquiry in determining adequacy of representation of interests is to \ndetermine adequacy. Whether a surrogate will adequately represent the interests of the \nmovant of course depends in part on the identity of their interests. If the interests of the two \ngroups are actually adverse, no amount of enthusiasm on the part of the party will constitute \nadequate representation. On the other hand, if the interests of the two groups appear to be \nidentical, the surrogate's representation will be adequate absent a showing of collusion, \nsome adverse interest, or a failure to fulfill the ability of representation. See, e.g., United \nStates v. United States Steel Corp., 548 F.2d 1232 (5th Cir.1977). \nAgain, the harder problems occur when interests are merely similar. In that case, the \nenthusiasm of the party may determine whether representation is adequate. If a party has \ninterests similar to those of the movant, but is lackadaisical in presenting them, \nrepresentation will not be adequate. See Liddell v. Caldwell, 546 F.2d 768 (8th \nCir.1976), cert. denied, 433 U.S. 914, 97 S.Ct. 2987, 53 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1977) (inadequate \nrepresentation because party had abandoned interest as evidenced by entry of consent \ndecree); Nuesse v. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, 704 n. 10 (D.C.Cir.1967) (\"Of course, even where \nthe interests of a person may have been adequately represented at trial, failure to take an \nappeal from an adverse 228*228judgment may introduce the element of inadequacy, \nentitling the interested person to intervene after judgment to file an appeal.\") The Fifth \n\nCircuit took this position in United States v. Georgia, 428 F.2d 377 (5th Cir.1970), where \nintervention was allowed because the United States failed to appeal on an issue. \nIn this case the Justice Department evidenced an even more striking lack of enthusiasm. \nThough sharing with the movant a similar interest in reducing one-race schools, the Justice \nDepartment not only did not appeal from a result leaving forty-seven percent of the black \nstudents in Caddo Parish in predominantly one-race schools, the Justice Department did \nnot even contest that result at trial. Rather, the Justice Department willingly embraced that \nresult as part of a consent decree it had itself negotiated. This is surely not sufficiently \nvigorous representation of the movant's interest in reaching the maximum amount of \ndesegregation possible.[3] \nC. Government as Party \nSome cases hold that a movant has a greater burden when attempting to show that the \ngovernment is an inadequate representative of the movant's interests. See C. Wright & A. \nMiller, supra, § 1909, at 528 n. 85. This requirement, however, does not impose any \nqualitatively different burden when the government is a party. \"It means only that there must \nbe a concrete showing of circumstances in the particular case that make the representation \ninadequate.\" Id. at 529. Thus, a mere claim to intervene to represent the black community's \ninterest in desegregation would probably not be adequate if the Justice Department were in \nthe case. See, e.g., United States v. Carroll County Board of Education, 427 F.2d 141 (5th \nCir.1970). \nIn this case, however, the movant has indeed alleged circumstances that would concretely \nshow inadequacy of representation. Phillips has claimed an interest in a greater degree of \ndesegregation than the Justice Department desired. An interest in a different sort of remedy \nfrom that the government desires is sufficient to support intervention of right. Cohn v. \nEEOC, supra. Phillips has also claimed a greater degree of enthusiasm than the \ngovernment showed in negotiating this consent decree. A willingness to press a claim more \nvigorously than the government is also sufficient to show inadequacy and support \nintervention of right. United States v. Georgia, supra. \nD. Conclusion on Adequacy \nPhillips was denied intervention in part because the trial court thought her interests were \nadequately represented by the government. But the government was willing to leave forty-\nseven percent of the black students in Caddo Parish in predominantly one-race schools. \nPhillips has a different interest from the Justice Department at least to the extent that the \nJustice Department can accept that fact and Phillips cannot. Furthermore, the government \nis so content with that result that it did not even contest it with a trial, much less an \nappeal. 229*229 Thus, at least to some degree it appears that Phillips' interests were not \nadequately represented. Whether or not Phillips has established inadequacy as a matter of \nlaw, she certainly has alleged facts that if true, would show inadequacy. She deserves a \nhearing on her contentions. Due process can tolerate no less than that. \n\nIII. TIMELINESS \nA motion to intervene must be timely, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24, and a determination of timeliness is \nwithin the discretion of the trial court, to be reversed only for an abuse of discretion. NAACP \nv. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 366, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 2603, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 (1973). The trial court \nfound, and the majority agreed, that Phillips' motion was untimely on its face, so that no \nhearing need have been held. My examination of the authorities in this Circuit convinces me \nthat Phillips has alleged circumstances that would, if true, make her motion timely. \nAccordingly, I believe the motion to intervene should be remanded for a hearing on the \nissue of timeliness. \nA. Majority Opinion \nMy basic disagreement with the majority opinion is simple but fundamental: I believe the \nmajority fundamentally misunderstands the opinion of this Court in Stallworth v. Monsanto \nCo., 558 F.2d 257 (5th Cir.1977) (per Clark, C.J.). The majority states \"[a]s established \nin Stallworth, id. [at 264], and [United States v. Marion County, 590 F.2d 146, 149 (5th \nCir.1979)], the relevant time period for gauging the timeliness of an application for \nintervention begins when the proposed intervenor knew or should have known of his or her \ninterest in the case.\" Majority Opinion, at 220. The majority concludes that given the long \nhistory of the case, the publicity surrounding the consent decree negotiations and Phillips' \ninvolvement in the negotiations, Phillips should have known of her interest in the case long \nbefore she moved to intervene. \nB. Stallworth and Progeny \nAs I read Stallworth, the clock does not start running on timeliness until the proposed \nintervenor knows or reasonably should know that intervention is necessary to protect the \nintervenor's interests. To be fair to the majority, Stallworth does use the phrase \"know or \nreasonably should have known about his interest in the case.\" E.g., 558 F.2d at 264, id. at \n265. The Stallworth Court, however, was principally concerned with rejecting the idea that \ntime starts running when the movant knows or should know of the pendency of the \naction. Stallworth did not explicitly distinguish between the time the movant became aware \nof an interest and the time the movant became aware of an inadequately represented \ninterest. Nonetheless, the rationale Stallworth uses to reject the first position also serves to \nreject the majority's position. \nStallworth itself plainly supports my reading. Stallworth was originally filed by black plaintiffs \nemployed by Monsanto Co., complaining that Monsanto's seniority system was racially \ndiscriminatory. The suit resulted in part in a consent decree restructuring seniority. When \nthe consent decree was implemented, white employees were relatively reduced in seniority \nand moved to intervene to protect their seniority. The district court denied the motion \nbecause it \"found that the appellants must have known of the pendency of the lawsuit at \nsome unspecified time prior to the date on which they had filed their petition.\" Id. at 262. \nThis Court reversed, holding that the relevant time to begin counting was when the decree \n\nwas implemented and the white employees were adversely affected, rather than when they \nshould have known of the pendency of the lawsuit. \nFirst, the Court noted that NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 37 L.Ed.2d \n648 (1973), did not \"require that the date on which the would-be intervenor became aware \nof the pendency of the action ... be considered for the purpose of determining whether he \nacted promptly.\" Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 264. Second, the Court relied on language \nin United Airlines v. 230*230 McDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 394, 97 S.Ct. 2464, 2469, 53 L.Ed.2d \n423 (1977), measuring timeliness from the time a would-be intervenor in a class action \n\"became aware that her interests `would no longer be protected by the named \nrepresentatives' rather than when she learned that the lawsuit was pending.\" Stallworth, 558 \nF.2d at 264. \nFinally, the court made the following policy argument: \nThird, a rule making knowledge of the pendency of the litigation the critical event would be \nunsound because it would induce both too much and too little intervention. It would \nencourage individuals to seek intervention at a time when they ordinarily can possess only a \nsmall amount of information concerning the character and potential ramifications of the \nlawsuit, and when the probability that they will misjudge the need for intervention is \ncorrespondingly high. Often the protective step of seeking intervention will later prove to \nhave been unnecessary, and the result will be needless prejudice to the existing parties and \nthe would-be intervenor if his motion is granted, and purposeless appeals if his motion is \ndenied. In either event, scarce judicial resources would be squandered, and the litigation \ncosts of the parties would be increased. Such a rule would also mean that many individuals \nwho excusably failed to appreciate the significance of a suit at the time it was filed would be \nbarred from intervening to protect their interests when its importance became apparent to \nthem later on. These effects would be inconsistent with two important purposes of Rule 24: \nto foster economy of judicial administration and to protect nonparties from having their \ninterests adversely affected by litigation conducted without their participation. Therefore, the \ntime that the would-be intervenor first became aware of the pendency of the case is not \nrelevant to the issue of whether his application was timely. \nId. at 264-65.[4] \nClearly, then, Stallworth contemplated measuring time from the point when the intervenor \nfirst became aware that his or her interests were inadequately represented. First, the \nlanguage from United Airlines explicitly starts timing from the point of knowledge of \ninadequate representation. Second, the policy argument makes sense only if timing starts \nwhen the movant becomes aware of inadequate representation of its views. That argument \ncriticizes a rule under which \"[o]ften the protective step of seeking intervention will later \nprove to have been unnecessary.\" Id. at 265. Certainly intervention when the movant's \ninterests are adequately represented is unnecessary, and Stallworth cannot be read as \nadvocating that. \nI am not the first person to read Stallworth in this manner. In Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d \n1306 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1011, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66 L.Ed.2d 469 (1980), this \n\nCourt addressed precisely the question before this panel. In considering the \nfirst Stallworth factor in determining timeliness, the Piambino Court stated: \nFurthermore, the question of timeliness is at least partially linked to the question of \nadequate representation. See United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 394, 97 S.Ct. \n2464, 2470, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977) (\"as soon as it became clear to the [intervenor] that the \ninterests of the unnamed class members would no longer be protected by the named class \nrepresentatives, she promptly moved to intervene to protect those interests\"); Allegheny \nCorp. v. Kirby, 344 F.2d 571, 574 (2d Cir.1965) (timeliness also turns on \"when the interests \nof the proposed intervenors were no longer properly represented\") (construing pre-1966 \nrule). \n231*231 Id. at 1321. Later the Piambino Court applied its reading of Stallworth to the facts of \nits case: \nEach of the Stallworth factors on timeliness points toward the conclusion that the application \nwas timely. First, although the [movant] knew as early as June 30, 1976, when the \ninjunction issued, that he had an interest in the litigation that might be impaired, there was \nabsolutely no reason for him to intervene at that time. [Defendant] immediately appealed \nand filed a sterling brief with this Court. In addition, [defendant's] attorneys met on several \noccasions with the [movant and others] and assured those people that they were \nprosecuting the appeal diligently and in good faith. In reliance upon those representations, \nand upon the obvious adequate representation of [defendant's] attorneys, ... [movant] did \nnot attempt to intervene. On January 28, 1977, when the settlement agreement was filed, \n[movant] then knew that his interests were no longer adequately represented by \n[defendant], and his motion to intervene was filed on February 14. This delay of a mere \nseventeen days cannot rationally be denominated as unreasonable. \nId. at 1324-25 (footnote omitted). If Stallworth itself were not plain enough, Piambino, a \nprecedent binding on this panel, makes it indisputably clear that timeliness is measured \nfrom the time the movant became aware that the original parties did not adequately \nrepresent the movant's interest in the lawsuit. Given the majority's awareness \nthat Piambino establishes the principle that timeliness depends on when a movant became \naware of inadequate representation of its interests, Majority Opinion at 34, I am astonished \nthat it applied a contrary legal rule.[5] \nC. Phillips' Motion and Timeliness \nThe last question regarding timeliness is whether Phillips' motion could have been timely \nunder Stallworth and Piambino. Phillips claims that she was unaware that the Justice \nDepartment inadequately represented her interests until publication of the consent decree. \nIf that is true, Phillips' motion was plainly timely. The appellees and the majority base their \nview of timeliness on the fact that Phillips was aware of, and had even participated in the \nnegotiation of, the consent decree, and so should have been apprised of its contents earlier. \nThat argument is unpersuasive. First, the fact of Phillips' awareness of negotiations does \nnot imply that she ever knew of the government's position. Second, even if she did know of \nthe government's initial position, it might not have occurred to her at that time that the \ngovernment would soften its position and accede to a settlement leaving forty-seven \n\npercent of the black Caddo Parish students in predominantly one-race schools. The majority \nsuggests that this result was simply the product of the normal give and take of negotiation. \nPhillips suggests that it resulted from a change in Justice Department policy initiated after \nthe change in administrations.[6]The cause underlying this result is irrelevant to the issue of \ntimeliness. The only relevant question is when Phillips knew or should have known that the \nJustice Department might accept such a result, when Phillips knew or should have known \nthat her interests were inadequately represented. I see no way that this question can be \ndetermined on the record before us. Accordingly, the district court should be instructed to \nhold a hearing and make factual findings on when Phillips 232*232knew or should have \nknown that her interests were inadequately represented. \nCONCLUSION \nThis ghost story, begun almost eighteen years ago, now draws to a mournful close. The \nghost class of black school-children, the very people most vitally concerned with the \nvigorous defense of their constitutional rights, are not to be heard, for this final chapter of \nthe story buries the case. In spite of three times having had their surrogate representatives \nchange positions and acquiesce in resolutions repugnant to the ghost class, they are told \ntheir interests were adequately represented. In spite of moving to intervene within a few \ndays of having learned of this last and most recent change in policy by the surrogate \nrepresentative, the ghost class are told that their motion was not timely. This is truly a story \nthat will scare small children. \nEven worse, this is a story that will scare grown-up judges, lawyers, and citizens concerned \nwith due process of law. Despite the long line of cases of this Circuit holding that a hearing \non a motion to intervene is a fundamental measure plainly required in order to afford due \nprocess of law, Phillips' motion to intervene was denied without even granting her a hearing \nto support the findings of the district court. Unlike the majority and the district court, I do not \nbelieve that it is \"more than clear\" that Phillips' motion should be denied. \nI would remand this case to the district court and direct it to hold a hearing and make \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. First, the court should determine whether the Justice \nDepartment adequately represented Phillips' interest in reducing the number of \npredominantly one-race schools substantially below the level reached in the consent \ndecree. Such inadequacy could be shown by evidence that the Justice Department thought \nthat the present level was sufficient, or that it did not value the case highly enough to press \nit to trial, or that the accoutrements of further desegregation, such as busing, violated the \nJustice Department's current enforcement approach. Second, if the Justice Department \nwere found to have inadequately represented Phillips' interests for these or any other \nreasons, the court should determine when Phillips knew or should have known of that \ninadequacy and then determine timeliness accordingly. \nThe majority disagrees with me and sees nothing objectionable in this case. That fact does \nnot anger me so much as frighten me. It has been many days since I first became apprised \nof this result, and it still gives me chills, even in broad daylight. I fervently hope it will be far \noff in the future on a dark, stormy night before I read another tale of the macabre as \ndisturbing as this one. \n\n[1] Former Rule 23(a) provided: \n\"(a) Representation. If persons constituting a class are so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all \nbefore the court, such of them, one or more, as will fairly insure the adequate representation of all may, on behalf of \nall, sue or be sued, when the character of the right sought to be enforced for or against the class is (1) joint, or \ncommon, or secondary in the sense that the owner of a primary right refuses to enforce that right and a member of \nthe class thereby becomes entitled to enforce it; (2) several, and the object of the action is the adjudication of claims \nwhich do or may affect specific property involved in the action; or (3) several, and there is a common question of law \nor fact affecting the several rights and a common relief is sought.\" \n[2] 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2 provides: \n\"Whenever an action has been commenced in any court of the United States seeking relief from the denial of equal \nprotection of the laws under the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution on account of race, color, religion, sex or \nnational origin, the Attorney General for or in the name of the United States may intervene in such action upon timely \napplication if the Attorney General certifies that the case is of general public importance. In such action the United \nStates shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.\" \n[3] The affidavit of Reverend Jones also stated that telegrams had been sent to Ford, Greenberg, and Chachkin \ninforming them of their dismissal and the reasons therefor. The telegrams were signed by Reverend Jones and two \nother parents of children named as plaintiffs in this suit. \n[4] The order itself is based, in part, on the failure of Ms. Ford to secure the signatures of all counsel representing \nplaintiffs. Detecting a lack of uniform direction on the part of the plaintiffs' attorneys, Judge Scott stated: \n\"The motion is signed only by Margrett Ford and should not be considered unless joined in by other counsel for \nplaintiffs at the time of its filing, namely Jack Greenberg and Norman Chachkin, ... and particularly plaintiffs' local \ncounsel at the time of the filing of the motion, namely Jesse N. Stone, Jr. and Arthur Thompson.... Adequate and \nproper representation of plaintiffs cannot be assured by divided counsel.\" \n[5] Paragraph 5 of this motion indicated that plaintiffs approved of the Committee plan and that, \"if implemented in \ntoto, [it] will provide a unitary school system in Caddo Parish ....\" \n[6] Also signing this motion as counsel for the applicants for intervention were James Nabrit, III and Hilry Huckaby, III. \nThe parties named as plaintiffs are the same as those named in the previous motion to add party plaintiffs filed by \nMs. Ford. \n[7] The reasons for Mr. Jefferson appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs is unclear. On September 15, 1976, he filed a \nnotice of appearance as counsel and four months later he was the signatory counsel on the above memorandum. \nPlaintiffs' other counsel, Murphy Bell, does not appear on this document. \n[8] Subsequent to the government's motion to amend the judgment, the district court notified the School Board that \nthe school system would continue to operate under the 1973 Committee desegregation plan until such time as the \ncourt could assess the government's objections. \n[9] Jesse Stone, one of plaintiffs' original retained counsel, contacted the court by letter to indicate that he had \nwithdrawn as counsel \"many months ago.\" The case file also contains an application for withdrawal of the record in \nthis case made by Arthur Thompson, of Shreveport, Louisiana, also one of plaintiffs' original retained counsel, on \nJune 9, 1980. There is, however, no indication that Mr. Thompson then or thereafter took any action on behalf of the \nplaintiffs. Finally, the case file contains a letter, dated July 30, 1980, from Jack Greenberg to Judge Stagg. In that \ndocument, Mr. Greenberg refers to a previous letter he had sent to Judge Stagg (on July 3, 1980) representing that \nhe was counsel for plaintiffs in this action. The letter of July 30 states that the previous representation was erroneous \nand that plaintiffs' counsel is Arthur Thompson; a copy of the letter to Arthur Thompson is shown. \n[10] Some twenty-eight such meetings are listed in the papers filed by the School Board below. \n[11] The district court's June 17, 1981 memorandum states, \"... this court agrees with the government's contention \nthat this action, in its present posture, is not in fact a class action. The government has never been designated as a \n\nclass representative, nor, as Phillips alleges, has it ever `purported' to represent a class. The government has \n`represented' parties in this case only in the sense that it is `entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action' \nunder Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2. No class has ever been certified in this action ....\" \nThe United States, in its opposition to Ms. Phillips' motion to intervene, filed below, stated, among other things, \"... the \nUnited States has not been designated as a representative of any class herein (nor has it ever purported to represent \na class, as petitioner mistakenly claims). This Court's June 3, 1980 order never designated the United States as a \nclass representative.\" \n[12] We employ July 3, 1980 as an approximation. The district court's order of June 3 provided the original plaintiffs \nand their counsel thirty days in which to acknowledge a continuing interest in the case. Thus, to simplify matters, we \nadd thirty days to June 3 and arrive at July 3 as the approximate date of termination for the private class claims. \n[13] Former Rule 23(a)(3), the \"spurious\" class action, required, in addition to the numerosity and adequate \nrepresentation requirements, the enforcement of a several right, a common question of law or fact, and a common \nrelief. The device was frequently described as a mechanism for permissive joinder of parties. See 7 C. Wright & A. \nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil § 1752 at 525 n. 85 (1972), and cases cited therein. As a result, many \ncourts held that the judgment in a spurious class action had no effect on the rights of nonappearing parties. See, \ne.g., California Apparel Creators v. Wieder of California, Inc., 162 F.2d 893, 897 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 816, \n68 S.Ct. 156, 92 L.Ed. 393 (1947); see also 3B J. Moore & J. Kennedy, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 23.10[7] (1982). \n[14] That one occasion was a memorandum submitted in January 1977 in opposition to the School Board's motion to \ndeclare the system unitary. \n[15] Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) provides: \n\"A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed \ndismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.\" \n[16] Ms. Phillips construes the district court's minute entry of June 3, 1980, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2 to establish the \nUnited States as the representative of a class similar to that broadly alleged in the plaintiffs' original complaint. This is \na misinterpretation of both provisions, and was properly rejected by Judge Stagg, who had entered the June 30 \norder. See note 11, supra. The order of June 3 did not indicate that at the expiration of thirty days the United States \nwould replace the private plaintiffs in the role of class representative; rather, it stated that the plaintiffs would \n\"acquiesce in having their interests represented by the United States as plaintiff-intervenor.\" This statement suggests \nthat the plaintiffs, should they decide not to come forward and continue the litigation, have no objection to the \ngovernment continuing to independently pursue the action as plaintiff-intervenor. Moreover, 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2 has \nbeen construed to authorize the United States to intervene as a party plaintiff and to continue in that capacity despite \nthe subsequent removal of the private plaintiffs. Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, supra. \n[17] Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) provides in part: \n\"For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for \ndismissal of an action or of any claim against him.... Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a \ndismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of \njurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the \nmerits.\" \nAlthough Rule 41(b) is written in terms of a motion for dismissal by the defendant, it is settled that the court may act \non its own to dismiss for want of prosecution, see Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., supra, and that Rule 41(b) codified that \npower, although only in part. See 9 C. Wright & A. Miller, supra § 2370 at 202 n. 92 (1971). \n[18] The absence of an order of dismissal differentiates this case from Weissinger v. United States, supra. The district \ncourt in Weissinger, following the presentation of all the evidence in an action tried to the court, concluded that the \ngovernment had failed to make a demand on the defendants for payment of two loans, a condition precedent to \nbringing legal action, and entered an order of dismissal with prejudice. In a second action by the government to \nrecover on the same loans, the district court held that the previous order of dismissal did not bar the second attempt. \nThis Court, sitting en banc, reversed the decision of the trial court and directed that judgment be rendered for the \n\ndefendants. In discussing the significance of Rule 41(b), Judge Godbold stated that the last sentence of the Rule \n\"establishes a procedure for construing the general and ambiguous dismissal order, one which does not say whether \nit is with or without prejudice.\" 423 F.2d at 798 (emphasis added). The Court also cited with approval Kern v. \nHettinger, 303 F.2d 333 (2d Cir.1962), a decision of the Second Circuit construing an order of dismissal that failed to \nspecify whether it was with or without prejudice. The holding of the Court in Weissinger was, however, a narrow one, \nand was stated by Judge Godbold at the conclusion of his opinion: \n\"[G]oing behind [a dismissal] order, if ever allowed, is not authority that a dismissal specified to be with prejudice, \nentered after full trial on all issues and with complete findings and conclusions, may be treated as a mere warm-up for \nanother trial if the unsuccessful party decides, without an appeal, that he would like to go around the track again.\" 423 \nF.2d at 799-800. \nThe present case involves a very different situation. The district court did not enter an order explicitly dismissing the \nsuit with prejudice, but instead entered no formal order of dismissal. It therefore becomes necessary, as we describe \nin full above, to investigate the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of the class suit to determine whether it was \nan adjudication on the merits. \n[19] With respect to the effect of the ultimate judgment in the suit, the \"class\" members are in the same position they \nwould have been in if the suit had not been brought as a class action. \n[20] The class action in Fowler was brought under Rule 23(b)(2), where \"the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class ....\" This would have been the appropriate category under \nwhich to make the class allegations here had the suit been filed after the effective date of the 1966 amendments to \nthe federal rules. \n[21] Fed.R.Civ.P. 24 provides in part: \n\"(a) Intervention of Right. Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a \nstatute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest \nrelating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the \naction may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is \nadequately represented by existing parties. \n\"(b) Permissive Intervention. Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a \nstatute of the United States confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and \nthe main action have a question of law or fact in common. When a party to an action relies for ground of claim or \ndefense upon any statute or executive order administered by a federal or state governmental officer or agency or \nupon any regulation, order, requirement or agreement issued or made pursuant to the statute or executive order, the \nofficer or agency upon timely application may be permitted to intervene in the action. In exercising its discretion the \ncourt shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original \nparties.\" \n[22] In her first supplemental motion to intervene, Ms. Phillips downplays the significance of her contact with the \ngovernment lawyer by suggesting, on information and belief, that his participation in the proceedings \"apparently \nterminated\" and he was replaced by another government lawyer (\"sometime\" between November 1980 and March \n1981), with whom she had no contact. According to Ms. Phillips' information and belief, the new lawyer \"primarily \nrepresented the Justice Department in negotiating the May, 1981 Consent Decree.\" The case file reflects that this \n\"new\" Justice Department attorney became counsel in the proceedings in November 1980 (another Justice \nDepartment attorney has been on all its pleadings in the case since at least November 1976). Even with this change \nin representatives for the United States—which Ms. Phillips deems significant—she did not move to intervene. \nInstead, she opted to wait for the outcome of the negotiations and then press her application for intervention. \nWe also note that at oral argument counsel for the School Board provided other indicia of Ms. Phillips' knowledge of \nthe course of these proceedings. He indicated that Ms. Phillips was a member of the Caddo Parish School Board \nduring 1975 and 1976, apparently as an interim appointee filling an unexpired term. This suggests that she \npossessed some knowledge of the 1973 desegregation plan and the parish's compliance with its directives. It also \nmay explain why, as the case file reflects, the United States elected to subpoena Ms. Phillips as an assistant during \nthe hearings before the Special Master in 1976. Counsel further stated that Ms. Phillips appeared at one of the public \nmeetings in 1981, where she addressed the subject which later became the basis for her objection to the consent \n\ndecree, the need for enrichment programs for the black students. Ms. Phillips' counsel did not on oral argument here \ndirectly or indirectly question any of these matters, nor has he done so at any other time (though having filed several \npost-argument briefs with this Court); nor do Ms. Phillips' filings in the district court even infer anything to the contrary. \n[23] Ms. Phillips does not say when she learned the consent decree was issued, or when during the period May 11 to \nMay 15 she learned its contents. The record indicates the decree was published in full in the local newspapers \nseveral days prior to May 11 and received extensive media publicity, none of which is denied by Ms. Phillips. \n[24] Although the United States initially objected to the 1973 Committee plan, it eventually attached a qualified \napproval of the plan to the order directing its implementation. After the 1973 plan became operative, the United \nStates did not affirmatively move to correct or improve its directives; the involvement by the government since that \ndate has been only reactive: opposing the School Board's motions for declaration of unitary status and for relief from \nthe faculty racial percentage requirements. \n[25] The district court also denied intervention because it found that \"the issues raised by Phillips in her initial motion \nhave all been considered and addressed by the Board and the Department of Justice. There can be no question that \nthe same is true of the issues raised in the first and second supplemental motions.\" In the parlance of Rule 24(a), the \ncourt found that \"the applicant's interest [was] adequately represented by existing parties.\" \nIn view of our resolution of the timeliness issue, it is not necessary to decide this issue today. Nonetheless, we do \nnote that Ms. Phillips' principal dispute with the 1981 consent decree is over the type and extent of relief it provides; a \ndisagreement that reflects more a difference in \"policy\" than any genuine shortcoming in the representation provided \nby the United States as plaintiff-intervenor. The test for adequate representation by existing parties in a school \ndesegregation context is well-established: \n\"If the court determined that the issues [the proposed intervenors] sought to present had been previously determined \nor if it found that the parties in the original action were aware of these issues and completely competent to represent \nthe interests of the new group, it could deny intervention.\" Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762, 765 \n(5th Cir.1973). \nSee United States v. Marion County School District, supra; Pate v. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501, 503 \n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 835, 100 S.Ct. 67, 62 L.Ed.2d 44 (1979). The burden of establishing inadequate \nrepresentation is on the applicant for intervention, United States v. South Bend Community School Corp., 511 \nF.Supp. 1352, 1357 (N.D.Ind. 1981), aff'd mem., 688 F.2d 842 (7th Cir.1982), and the applicant must make a \"`very \ncompelling showing' that representation of the public interest by the United States is not adequate in suits such as \nthis ....\" United States v. Board of Education, 88 F.R.D. 679 at 686 (citation omitted). \nIt is apparent that Ms. Phillips' primary complaint on appeal about the decree—its retention of some fourteen \npredominately black schools—was a topic that received much attention in the negotiations between the School Board \nand the United States. According to the School Board, the plan contained in the consent decree will reduce the \nnumber of one-race schools from thirty-three to fourteen. Further, it provides for several desegregation methods, \nsuch as majority-to-minority transfers and magnet and lab schools, that can also reduce the number of one-race \nschools. It appears unlikely that Ms. Phillips can satisfy the requirement of showing that representation by the United \nStates was inadequate on this issue. \nIn her brief to this Court, Ms. Phillips points to a newspaper article, published May 14, 1981 in the Shreveport Journal, \nconcerning an interview given by the United States Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana regarding what the \narticle calls a \"closed door\" meeting March 16, 1981 with the Justice Department. Ms. Phillips directs our \nattention, inter alia, to statements in the article that \"[a]t that meeting, the U.S. Justice Department backed off its \nprevious stand of insisting on pairing Caddo [Parish elementary schools]\"; that the United States Attorney \"said his \nposition was that if the Justice Department did not discontinue advocating pairing or cross-town busing of elementary \nstudents that the lawsuit against the School Board would go to court and that `public education in the parish would \nsuffer.' The longest distance a student will be bused in accordance with the Caddo desegregation plan is less than \nfive miles, [the United States Attorney] said\"; and that the United States Attorney \"said that after the Caddo school \ncase was transferred to ... Judge Tom Stagg [in August 1979] it became obvious that further action would be taken \nbecause of the present law not allowing a large number of predominantly one-race schools in such cases.\" Although \nthe article was published in the local paper over a week before Ms. Phillips' first motion to intervene, she made no \nsuch or similar allegations before the district court, nor did she there allege that the United States or the School Board \n\nled her (or the \"class\") to believe, or that she (or the \"class\") in fact believed, that the settlement between the United \nStates and the School Board would provide for more elementary school pairing or crosstown busing than it did. \nWhile proof of collusion between a nominal representative and an opposing party will establish inadequate \nrepresentation, see Martin v. Kalvar Corp., 411 F.2d 552, 553 (5th Cir.1969); United States v. Board of School \nCommissioners, 466 F.2d 573, 575 (7th Cir.1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 909, 93 S.Ct. 964, 35 L.Ed.2d 271 \n(1973), we find nothing improper in the government, through the Justice Department, conferring with its \nrepresentative in the State of Louisiana. Even assuming that the government altered its position on these elementary \nschools, this decision was probably indicative of the bargaining that is essential to reaching a viable settlement \nagreement, a method of resolving school desegregation matters that is preferable to complete \nlitigation. See Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 318. Despite possible \"policy\" or \"emphasis\" shifts in the executive and \nlegislative branches of government, we refuse to infer that the Justice Department is no longer enforcing the \nfourteenth amendment in active matters such as this one. See United States v. Board of Education, 88 F.R.D. at 687 \nn. 9. \n[26] On appeal, Ms. Phillips asks that this Court remand her case to the district court with directions to permit her \nintervention. A hearing on the motion to intervene, according to Ms. Phillips, would be \"a total waste of time.\" \n[1] There is some dispute over this figure, but given the procedural posture of the case I must accept Phillips' \ncontention. \n[2] There are two other items that trouble me enough that I must at least allude to them. First is the majority's \ntreatment of the class status of this action. This case was filed as a class action at a time when certification was not \nrequired. That would seem initially to qualify this case as a class action. Furthermore, on the last appeal to this \ncourt, Jones v. Caddo Parish School Bd., 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974), the case was plainly held to be a class action. \nThus, notwithstanding any retroactive application of the 1966 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe law of the case demands that this case be treated as a class action. If the case were a class action, I have \nserious doubts that Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e), calling for notice to the class before dismissal, does not apply as the majority \nholds it does not. \nSecond, as a judge of this Court, I am greatly distressed to see a mandate of this Court calling for a remand to \ndetermine the nature and composition of the plaintiff class, id., ignored by judge and litigants alike. Even if the \nvictorious appellants did not act, I think the judge had some duty after the mandate to ensure that the named class \nrepresentatives actually represented the class. \nI do not belabor those points now because I believe that merely holding a hearing on intervention, which the majority \nalso denies, would suffice to cure these other ills. \n[3] The majority cites Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762 (5th Cir.1973), as establishing the \ndefinitive test for adequacy of representation. The majority relies on the following language: \nIf the court determined that the issues [the proposed intervenors] sought to present had been previously determined \nor if it found that the parties in the original action were aware of those issues and completely competent to represent \nthe interests of the new group, it could deny intervention. \nId. at 765. The majority notes that the parties were aware of the problem of one-race schools and discussed it, and \nconcludes that it is unlikely that the movant could show inadequacy. \nI believe that the majority misinterprets Hines. First, Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2) does not include any special test for school \ncases. The basic standard for adequacy in school cases is the same as in all others. Hines does not purport to be \ndoing anything quite as radical as creating a separate standard. No argument for that is given, nor are any cases \ncited. Hines merely summarizes in general terms the requirements for intervention. The first leg of Hines merely \nrequires that the motion be timely; the second leg of Hines restates the requirement of adequacy. If \nanything, Hines strengthens the adequacy requirement by requiring that the parties be \"completely competent\" to \nrepresent the interests of the movant. \n[4] Stallworth goes on to describe three other factors to be used in determining timeliness, Stallworth, 558 F.2d at \n265-66, and then lists a factor that should be ignored, id. at 266: any \"absolute\" measure of timeliness, such as how \n\nfar the litigation has progressed when intervention is sought. I am interested to note that the majority places great \nrhetorical weight on this verboten factor. \n[5] The only other case cited by the majority on this point certainly does not conflict with the law established \nby Stallworth and Piambino. United States v. Marion County, 590 F.2d 146 (5th Cir.1979), involved an attempt to \nintervene to contest a consent decree some four years after it had been implemented. The movant there had had four \nyears to discover its interests were inadequately represented by the parties. \n[6] I certainly do not suggest that the Reagan administration was not entitled to alter its enforcement policies in school \ndesegregation cases. I merely observe that such a shift may justify intervention by people whose views were \npreviously adequately represented by the Justice Department. \n ",

We sustain the district court's ruling, \nholding that it did not abuse its discretion in determining that Ms. Phillips' motion was \nuntimely. \nThis litigation began in 1965 when seven black school children and their parents filed a \ncomplaint against the Caddo Parish School Board alleging the school system was operated \non a biracial basis, in violation of their rights under the equal protection clause of the \nfourteenth amendment. Plaintiffs sought to represent themselves and a class of \"Negro \nchildren and their parents in Caddo Parish,\" pursuant to 925*925 Rule 23(a)(3), \nFed.R.Civ.P., as then in effect.[1] Later the same year, the United States sought to intervene \nas a party plaintiff pursuant to Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-\n\n2.[2] We held it was entitled to do so, United States v. Jefferson County Board of \nEducation, 372 F.2d 836, 896 (5th Cir.1966), aff'd with modifications, 380 F.2d 385 (5th \nCir.) (en banc), cert. denied,389 U.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 77, 19 L.Ed.2d 104 (1967), and \nthereafter the United States has participated as a party to the case. \nAs set out in more detail below, in 1973 the district court approved and made \"the order of \nthis Court\" a school desegregation plan developed after several public hearings by a \nbiracial Citizens Committee which the court had appointed on the motion of the United \nStates. The Committee's unanimous report stated that the plan's full implementation would \nconvert \"the school district to a unitary system.\" The United States approved \nimplementation of the plan, but did not commit itself, one way or the other, as to whether the \nplan would achieve unitary status. The plaintiffs, however, not only requested \nimplementation of the plan, but also specifically took the position that its complete \nimplementation \"will provide a unitary school system in Caddo Parish.\" Later the same year, \nseveral other black parents and students sought to intervene, individually and as \nrepresentatives of a class or subclass of black students and parents, to attack the 1973 plan \non the ground that it maintained too many \"racially identifiable and one-race schools.\" They \nalleged that the plaintiffs did not adequately represent their interests and the United States \ndid not either. In August 1974 we reversed the district court's denial of the requested \nintervention, holding that the applicants \"are entitled to an evidentiary hearing on their \nmotion to intervene.\" Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914, 917 (5th \nCir.1974) (per curiam). The attempted intervention, however, was never pursued thereafter. \nThe school district continued to operate under the 1973 plan until 1981, and the case \nremained largely inactive. After August 1974 the plaintiffs took no action whatever in the \ncase, except for filing a memorandum in January 1977 taking the position that the 1973 plan \nhad not been entirely complied with and should be \"continued in effect until fully \nimplemented.\" \nOn June 3, 1980, following a status conference the previous day attended only by attorneys \nfor the School Board and the United States, the district court entered a minute order \nproviding that counsel should contact the court within thirty days if \"plaintiffs still have a \nviable interest in this 926*926 case.\"[3] Copies of this order were sent all counsel who had \never appeared in the case, including those representing the 1973 intervention applicants, \nand none ever made any affirmative response. Thereafter, the United States and the School \nBoard entered into widely publicized negotiations, which lasted nearly a year, and \nculminated on May 5, 1981 when they executed a proposed two-party Consent Decree, \nwhich the district court entered on May 7, 1981. Pursuant to the court's directions, the \ndecree was publicized and a ten-day period allowed for objections. Ms. Phillips, though she \ntimely filed objections of a limited nature, now essentially abandoned, did not seek to \nintervene until May 22, 1981, four days after the expiration of the period for filing objections. \nThe United States and the School Board opposed her intervention, among other grounds, \nas being untimely. Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied \nintervention on that basis. It also ruled that Ms. Phillips' interests were adequately \nrepresented by the United States. \nThe complaint which Ms. Phillips seeks to make by her intervention is that the Consent \nDecree will leave too many one-race or predominantly one-race schools attended by too \nhigh a proportion of the district's black students. This is essentially the same complaint \n\nmade by the 1973 intervention applicants concerning the 1973 plan. Concededly, however, \nthe Consent Decree provides a material improvement in those respects from the 1973 plan, \nwhich the United States had not previously opposed and which the plaintiffs regarded as \nproviding a unitary system. \nUnder the unchallenged facts here, Ms. Phillips, and those she sought to represent, knew, \nor at the very least should have known, of their interests in the case some six years or more \nbefore they sought intervention. Indeed, these same interests were reflected in the 1973 \nattempted intervention, sought on the basis that neither the plaintiffs nor the United States \nadequately represented those interests. That intervention was not pursued after 1974, and \nthe school system continued to operate under the 1973 plan, with the blessing of the \nplaintiffs and without challenge by the United States, until the 1981 Consent Decree. That \ndecree, an unquestioned material improvement over the 1973 plan from the point of view of \nthe 1973 and 1981 applicants for intervention, violates no express or implied assurances to \nthe would-be intervenors and represents no change of position adverse to their interests. \nNor are they parties to it or bound by it. It was arrived at after an arduous and well-\npublicized settlement process lasting nearly a year, of which Ms. Phillips and the interests \nshe seeks to represent were indisputably aware. Under these circumstances, the district \ncourt did not abuse its discretion in determining that intervention sought after the time for \nfiling objections to the decree was untimely. No hearing was necessary because the matters \napparent of record support the district court's determination, there being neither challenge \nto them nor proffered facts to justify or explain the evident untimeliness which they reflect. \nIndeed, the lack of a hearing, as such, is not the focus of Ms. Phillips' appeal. \nBy the express terms of Rule 24, Fed.R.Civ.P., it is apparent that timeliness is a \nprerequisite for intervention additional to all the other necessary conditions for that relief \n(including, as to intervention of right, lack of adequate representation by any existing party). \nAnd, it has been uniformly held that the district court's determination of whether the \nrequested intervention is timely may be reversed only for abuse of discretion. As the \nSupreme Court stated in NAACP v. New York, 413 U.S. 345, 93 S.Ct. 2591, 37 L.Ed.2d 648 \n(1973): \n927*927 \"... the application must be `timely.' If it is untimely, intervention must be denied. \nThus, the court where the action is pending must first be satisfied as to timeliness. Although \nthe point to which the suit has progressed is one factor in the determination of timeliness, it \nis not solely dispositive. Timeliness is to be determined from all the circumstances. And it is \nto be determined by the court in the exercise of its sound discretion; unless that discretion is \nabused, the court's ruling will not be disturbed on review.\" Id. at 365-66, 93 S.Ct. at 2603 \n(footnotes omitted; emphasis added).[4] \nAnd, where facts justifying the conclusion that the application is untimely are undisputed \nand apparent on the face of the record, intervention may be denied on this ground without a \nhearing, as we expressly held in United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314, 315 (5th \nCir.1982). \nNAACP v. New York, supra, is particularly instructive. There, New York sued the United \nStates in December 1971 for declaratory judgment that literacy tests in certain New York \ncounties had not abridged the right to vote on account of race, and hence were not \n\nproscribed by the Voting Rights Act's prohibition of such tests in political subdivisions, such \nas the counties concerned, where less than half those of age voted in the 1968 presidential \nelection. On March 10, 1972 the United States filed its answer stating it was without \ninformation sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of New York's allegations, and on March \n17 New York moved for summary judgment, which the United States consented to on April \n3. The NAACP and black voters and elected officials in one of the counties moved to \nintervene on April 7. The United States did not oppose the intervention. On April 13 the \ndistrict court granted the summary judgment and denied the intervention. Affidavits, which \nthe Supreme Court accepted arguendo as accurate, showed that intervenors first learned of \nthe suit on March 21 and of the United States' consent to the motion for summary judgment \non April 5; that on March 23 a Justice Department attorney had advised the NAACP's \ncounsel \"that papers were being prepared in opposition to New York's motion for summary \njudgment\"; and that during the last two weeks in March \"attorneys in the Department of \nJustice thrice had represented to appellants' counsel that the United States would oppose \nNew York's motion for summary judgment.\" Id. 413 U.S. at 361-62, 93 S.Ct. at 2600-01. \nIntervenors also alleged that the Justice Department inadequately investigated the case and \nthat evidence was available, precluding summary judgment, that in the counties concerned \neducation afforded nonwhite children by New York was substantially inferior to that afforded \nwhites with resulting lower literacy rates for nonwhites otherwise eligible to vote. Id. at 362-\n64, 93 S.Ct. at 2601-02. \nThe Supreme Court held that \"because of the motion's untimeliness\" the district court's \ndenial of intervention was \"not an abuse of the court's discretion.\" Id. at 366, 93 S.Ct. at \n2603. The Court initially observed that the district court could reasonably have concluded \nthat the intervention applicants \"should have known of the pendency\" of the action as early \nas February because, among other things, of a New York Times newspaper article and \n\"public 928*928 comment by community leaders.\" Id. It went on to hold that, in any event, the \nanswer of the United States \"revealed that it was without information with which it could \noppose the motion for summary judgment,\" and it was hence \"incumbent upon the \nappellants ... to take immediate affirmative steps to protect their interests either by \nsupplying the Department of Justice with any information they possessed ... or ... by way of \nan immediate motion to intervene,\" rather than relying \"on representations said to have \nbeen made by Department of Justice attorneys during the course of telephone \nconversations.\" Id. at 367-68, 93 S.Ct. at 2604. Because of its conclusion that the motion \nwas untimely, the Court expressly declined \"to consider whether other conditions for \nintervention under Rule 24 were satisfied.\" Id. at 369, 93 S.Ct. at 2605. \nSimilarly instructive is this Court's decision in United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314 (5th \nCir.1982), affirming the district court's denial without a hearing of requested intervention. \nThat case involved an action commenced in March 1974 by the United States against the \nState of Louisiana and state higher education agencies seeking the dismantling of an \nallegedly unlawful dual system of higher education based on race. Subsequently, the district \ncourt denied without a hearing a motion to intervene by the NAACP and its state president, \nand in December 1976 this Court remanded with instructions that a hearing be held on the \nmotion. United States v. Louisiana, 543 F.2d 1125 (5th Cir.1976). Thereafter, for several \nyears little activity ensued in the case. Then, as reflected by the district court's opinion, 90 \nF.R.D. 358, 361 (E.D.La.1981), in 1981 those who had \"monitored\" the case as counsel for \nthe NAACP filed a motion to intervene \"not in the name of the NAACP but in the names of \n\nTrevor Brown, other identified proposed intervenors, and the class the named intervenors \nseek to represent.\" The class consisted of Louisiana black teachers, students and \nprospective students and their parents, and the district court stated \"there can be no doubt \nthat [the applicants] ... have a sincere and legitimate interest in the subject matter of this \nlitigation.\" Id. at 360-61 & n. 1. However, it noted that the Louisiana NAACP president had \npublicly stated that he and \"his organization\" had \"nothing to do with\" the proposed \nintervenors. Id. at 361. On appeal, this Court observed \"it was not clear that the proposed \nintervenors were the same as those who [had] moved for intervention in 1974.\" 669 F.2d at \n315. Sustaining the denial of intervention, we went on to state: \n\"As a general proposition, the timeliness of an application for intervention is an issue that \naddresses the discretion of the district court .... We cannot say, in view of the NAACP's \ngreat and undisputed delay — over four years — in advancing the second motion that the \norder denying it was such an abuse. Nor was a hearing needed in such \ncircumstances.\" Id. (emphasis added). \nWe also described the four-year delay in seeking intervention following the earlier appeal as \n\"itself an adequate and sufficient ground for its denial.\" Id. \nThe parallels to the case at bar are striking. Though this action had then been pending and \nsporadically active for some seven years, we can for present purposes begin our detailed \nconsideration of its procedural history in 1972 when plaintiffs filed a motion and an \namended motion for further relief directed to the School Board's desegregation plan, which \nthe district court had approved in February 1970, and especially requesting elimination of \nschools having a student \"racial composition substantially disproportionate to the system-\nwide racial composition.\" In response, the United States moved that the district court \nappoint an eleven-person biracial Citizens Committee to develop a new desegregation plan. \nOn March 20, 1973 the court, signing the form of order submitted by the United States, \nappointed such a committee, designating the same members and chairman suggested by \nthe United States (five blacks, five whites, and a white chairman, voting only in case of a \ntie), and directing it 929*929 to conduct an investigation and develop a desegregation plan. \nThe Committee, among other things, held seven public hearings and twenty-one private \nmeetings, and reviewed plans submitted by the School Board, the plaintiffs, various \nneighborhood groups, PTAs, and others. Its unanimous report, filed in June 1973, proposed \na three-year plan, to be monitored by a court-appointed biracial Advisory Committee, whose \nfull implementation \"will bring about the conversion of the school district to a unitary \nsystem.\" \nPlaintiffs ultimately moved that the Committee plan be approved, advising that \"if \nimplemented in toto, [it] will provide a unitary school system in Caddo Parish,\" and that \nalthough thirty-four one-race or predominantly one-race schools would remain, the \"plaintiffs \n... have concluded that there are sufficient facts extant and stated within the plan to fully \njustify the continued existence of these schools ....\"[5] The United States in its \"response\" \nstated that \"the Committee's recommendations should be implemented at the \ncommencement of the 1973-74 school year.\" Although this response observed that \"the \nplan provides for effective desegregation in certain formerly one-race or predominantly one-\nrace schools,\" it went on to state: \n\n\"However, the student desegregation plan also proposes the continued operation of 34 one-\nrace or predominantly one-race schools. With regard to these schools, the plan does not, as \nrequired by the March 20, 1973 order, state the facts relied upon to justify their continued \noperation, provide options to fully desegregate them, or state the feasibility of implementing \nall or parts of desegregation plans for these schools on record in this case. Of course, facts \ntending to demonstrate that the composition of a school is the result of de facto segregation \nunrelated to Board actions, or that desegregation of one-race schools can only be achieved \nthrough new school construction, or other facts may be relevant to the determination of \nwhether desegregation steps are required in regard to such schools. Absent these \ndeterminations, we are unable to respond at this time to the question whether the plan in \nregard to these schools conforms with constitutional standards.\" \nIn essence, then, the United States' \"response\" was that the plan implementation should \ncommence and, reminiscent of NAACP v. New York, that the plan might or might not be \nadequate but the United States did not have enough information to form a belief as to \nwhether it actually was or was not adequate. \nApproximately a week later, on July 20, 1973, the district court entered an order that the \nCommittee plan \"is hereby approved and made the order of this Court,\" and directed its \nimplementation, commencing with the opening of the 1973-74 school year. At the foot of \nthis order the United States made the following endorsement: \"The present posture of this \nlawsuit considered, the United States ... interjects no objection to ordering implementation \nof this plan, as is more fully set out in its response filed herein.\" \nThe 1973-74 school year thus opened under the Committee plan, and a ten- or twelve-\nperson biracial Advisory Committee, as provided for in the plan, was appointed 930*930 and \ncommenced functioning with equal white and black membership, one of the latter being \nchairman. \nIn November 1973 several black parents and students (the same persons who had earlier \nsought to be made additional named plaintiffs, see note 5, supra) sought to intervene as \nplaintiffs individually and as representatives of a class or subclass of black students and \nparents. Their tendered complaint attacked the Committee plan approved by the court \n\"because it maintains (without legal, educational or practical justification) racially identifiable \nand one-race schools within Caddo Parish.\" The motion to intervene acknowledged a \ndifference of opinion in the black community and alleged: \n\"Applicants for intervention and the class or subclass they represent are not adequately \nrepresented by the original plaintiffs herein. Nor are their interests protected by the United \nStates of America ... which acceded to the approval and implementation of the current \nplan of operation .... There is no relationship, contractual or otherwise, between \napplicants for intervention or the said class or subclasses which applicants represent and \nthe United States, except a statutory relationship pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-6 ... which \nauthorizes the Attorney General of the United States to commence such litigation at his \ndiscretion. Applicants for intervention and the class or subclasses whom they \nrepresent have no control, in law or in fact, over the course of such litigation except insofar \nas the Attorney General or his representative chooses to hear, respect and act upon the \nwishes of applicants for intervention and the class.\" (Emphasis added.) \n\nThe district court denied the intervention without a hearing. The applicants appealed to this \nCourt, where they were actively opposed by the plaintiffs. The United States took no \nposition respecting the appeal. In August 1974 we reversed, holding \"appellants are entitled \nto an evidentiary hearing on their motion to intervene.\" Jones v. Caddo Parish School \nBoard, 499 F.2d 914 at 917. \nNo hearing was sought by the intervention applicants or anyone on behalf of the class or \nsubclass they sought to represent, and for the next some two years the case was inactive \nand the school system continued to operate under the Committee's plan. In July 1976 the \nbiracial Advisory Committee reported to the court that the School Board, though it had made \ndefinite progress, had not yet fully complied with the three-year desegregation plan \nestablished by the July 1973 order, and recommended a one-year extension of the plan to \nJuly 1977. In August 1976 the district court ordered the magistrate to take evidence \nrespecting the School Board's compliance with the 1973 order. The School Board then filed \na motion alleging that it had fully complied with the 1973 order and seeking a declaration of \nunitary status and dismissal of the suit. In November the United States filed its response to \nthe School Board's motion, urging that dismissal should not be ruled on until it was \ndetermined whether the 1973 plan had been fully complied with. Later that month \nproceedings were held before the magistrate, and the record was forwarded to the district \ncourt.[6] \nIn January 1977 the plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the School Board's \nmotion to dismiss, urging that \"the plan to date has not been complied with. Therefore, the \ndefendants' Motion to Dismiss should be rejected and the plan continued in effect until fully \nimplemented.\" This was the first action in the case by plaintiffs since August 1974; it is also \nthe last time that plaintiffs have taken any action in the suit. Also in January 1977 the United \nStates filed a memorandum contending that the School Board had not fully complied with \nthe 1973 plan and that it 931*931 should be required to file a report by March 13, 1977 \nshowing its progress to that date \"and any plans that it will implement in the future to meet \nthe requirements of the July 20, 1973 order.\" \nNearly another year passed without any activity until, on December 30, 1977, the district \ncourt entered a memorandum ruling, finding that the Board had fully complied with the 1973 \nplan and that the district was unitary.[7] A judgment dismissing the suit was entered the \nsame day. No appeal was taken from the order or judgment, and the plaintiffs filed no \nobjection to either. However, on January 11, 1978 the United States moved to amend the \ncourt's judgment and findings on the ground that the only matter referred to the magistrate, \nand to which the parties had directed their evidence, was whether the Board had complied \nwith the 1973 plan, so that the government did not have \"adequate notice or opportunity for \na hearing on the issue of dismissal\" or of unitary status. It also contended that \"the record is \nvoid of evidence on which this Court could base a finding\" of unitary status. It accordingly \nprayed that the court \"set an appropriate schedule for discovery and a hearing on the issue \nof whether the defendants' current operation meets constitutional requirements.\" Similarly to \nits response to the 1973 plan itself, this motion of the United States did not take a position \none way or the other as to whether, in actual fact, the 1973 plan, as implemented to \nJanuary 1978, was or was not constitutionally adequate. \n\nNo action was taken on this motion of the United States, and the system continued to be \noperated under the 1973 plan. Nothing further transpired in the case for nearly two and a \nhalf years more until the above-mentioned June 2, 1980 status conference before Judge \nStagg.[8] \nThereafter, the United States and the Board entered into widely publicized settlement \nnegotiations lasting nearly a year, which led up to the execution of the Consent Decree in \nMay 1981. Numerous public meetings (twenty-eight are listed in the papers filed by the \nBoard below) were held throughout the community, principally in February, March and April \n1981, to inform the citizens about various desegregation approaches and to obtain \ncommunity input. Representatives of the Justice Department met with black civic leaders, \nand also received input from black citizen and parent groups.[9] \n932*932 The Consent Decree was adequately publicized,[10] and Ms. Phillips (along with \napproximately fourteen other objectors and groups of objectors) timely filed her objection. \nThis was wholly limited to claimed inadequacy in remedial programs for black preschool and \nelementary students, listed specific remedial programs for elementary and preschool black \nchildren which should be provided, and stated she \"reserves the right to intervene ... on \nbehalf of a class of Black persons whose children will need the [remedial] programs \ndescribed above.\" \nAfter expiration of the period for filing objections, Ms. Phillips filed her motion to intervene, \nlater twice supplemented, in which her ultimate complaint is that the Consent Decree leaves \ntoo many predominantly one-race schools attended by too high a proportion of the black \nstudents. She alleged \"that the United States has not represented the best interests of The \nClass\" which she sought to represent. \nMs. Phillips specifically addressed the issue of timeliness in her motions to intervene, \nstating, \"Mover shows that this intervention is timely because Mover presumed that the \nUnited States would represent the best interest of Mover and The Class which she seeks to \nrepresent\" until she learned of the contents of the Consent Decree. But, as the district court \nstated in denying Ms. Phillips' motion, \"The public had been kept well-informed of the \nprogress of the parties' negotiations and were given every opportunity to voice their \nopinions in public meetings held in all parts of the parish.\" Moreover, Ms. Phillips, who had \nbeen a participant in the November 1976 hearings, a School Board member thereafter and \na parent of one or more children in the school system for several years, obviously was, or \nshould have been, aware for many years not only of the mere pendency of the case but of \nher interest in it, and this is likewise obviously true of the class she seeks to represent. \nIndeed, Ms. Phillips has never denied this, either in the district court or on \nappeal.[11] Moreover, her claim is not that she was unaware of the prolonged, well-\npublicized settlement process, but rather that she did not know the United States would \nagree to this decree which she claims left too many predominantly one-race schools \nattended by too many black students. As her counsel candidly stated on oral argument, \n\"She knew negotiations were going on. Sure. But she had no idea to what the United States \nwas going to agree to until she saw the Consent Decree.\" \nIt is important to understand that the record clearly indicates, and Ms. Phillips has never \ndisputed and indeed concedes, that the Consent Decree at the least materially reduces the \n\nnumber of predominantly one-race schools and of black students attending them as \ncompared to the previously existing situation and the 1973 decree. It is unquestioned that \nthe Consent Decree is a real improvement from the point of view of Ms. Phillips and the \nclass she seeks to represent. Her point is that it is not 933*933 enough of an improvement. \nFurther, Ms. Phillips does not claim, and never has claimed, that the United States ever \ninformed her or the class, directly or indirectly, that the United States would insist on a \ngreater level of integration than that provided by the Consent Decree or that the United \nStates changed from positions it had previously taken, publicly or otherwise, or in any sense \nswitched directions, adversely to the interests she seeks to represent. Nor does the record \nsuggest any such change in position or direction. \nAs the record clearly reflects, the 1973 plan was the product of a unanimous biracial \nCitizens Committee, arrived at after numerous public meetings, the Committee itself having \nbeen appointed and each of its members individually having been selected on the motion of \nthe United States. The United States approved implementation of the 1973 plan, over the \nobjections of those in the black community having the same viewpoint and concerns as Ms. \nPhillips, and until the Consent Decree, some eight years later, never did anything to attempt \nto bring about a level of integration beyond that of the 1973 plan. While it is true that the \nUnited States refused to agree that the 1973 plan was necessarily the last word, its \nconsistent position in this respect was merely that the plan had not been proven to establish \na unitary system rather than that it actually did not do so or could not be shown to. This, of \ncourse, was recognized by the previous applicants for intervention, whose pleadings \naverred that \"their interests [are not] protected by the United States of America.\"[12] In \nessence, the United States from 1973 to 1980 accepted the 1973 plan. If it has made any \nchange in direction it is only that in 1981 it ceased to leave things on \"dead center\" and \nactually moved the school system to a materially more integrated condition. \nIn these undisputed circumstances, nothing in United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. \n385, 97 S.Ct. 2464, 53 L.Ed.2d 423 (1977), Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257 (5th \nCir.1977), or Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Piambino \nv. Sylva, 449 U.S. 1011, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66 L.Ed.2d 469 (1980), suggests that Ms. Phillips' \nintervention was timely, or that the district court lacked discretion to determine it was \nuntimely. \nStallworth, in addition to considering the factors of relative prejudice and unusual \ncircumstances, to be addressed below, emphasizes the distinction, for purposes of \ndetermining when the timeliness clock starts to run, between \"the date on which the would-\nbe intervenor became aware of the pendency of the action\" and \"the date on which he \nlearned of his interest in the case.\" Id. at 264. \nThe nature and purpose of such a distinction is aptly illustrated by the facts \nof Stallworth. That was a Title VII suit by black employees against their employer, and the \nwould-be intervenors (appellants) were white employees. A partial consent decree was \nentered March 7 which provided for abolition of departmental seniority. The employer had \nbeen engaged in a \"rollback\" since February, but prior to March 17 appellants had either \nbeen told by their employer they would not be rolled back or had retained their jobs while \nothers were rolled back. Commencing March 17, however, by virtue of the Consent Decree, \nappellants (who claimed contract rights in their seniority) were rolled back while other \n\nemployees, white as well as black, with less departmental seniority were not. Within three \nweeks appellants sought to intervene. They asserted that the Consent Decree was \n\"unnecessarily broad\" because its \"abolition of the departmental seniority system enabled \nsome white employees who 934*934 were not members of the class affected by racial \ndiscrimination to pass the appellants on the seniority ladder.\" Id. at 262 (emphasis added). \nUltimately, they complained of the decree not \"insofar as it affected the rights of black \nemployees, but only insofar as it affected the comparative seniority status of white \nemployees.\" Id. We held the evidence showed \"appellants did not know that their \ninterests might be affected by a lawsuit until March 7.\" Id. at 267 (emphasis added). \nNaturally, the white employees had no reason to think their interests vis-a-vis other \nwhites would be adversely affected by a racial discrimination suit filed by black employees. \nBy contrast, it was surely many years before May 1981 when Ms. Phillips realized or should \nhave realized that the interests she sought to advance by her intervention \"might be \naffected by\" this lawsuit. \nThe test we announced in Stallworth for this first factor was \"[t]he length of time during \nwhich the would-be intervenor actually knew or reasonably should have known of his \ninterest in the case.\" Id. at 264. We arrived at this conclusion after reviewing NAACP v. New \nYork and United Airlines, and we equated knowledge of \"an interest in the case\" with \nknowledge of an interest which \"might be affected by\" the outcome of the case. Nothing \nin Stallworth suggests that knowledge of the actual outcome of a case is necessary. And, \nwhile Stallworth holds that knowledge of mere pendency is not necessarily or inevitably \nknowledge of one's interest in the case, as it was not under the facts \nin Stallworth, nevertheless it recognizes that knowledge of the suit may indeed be \n\"tantamount to knowledge\" of one's interest in it. Id. at 264.[13] The widespread publicity \nconcerning and involvement of the black community with matters relating to this lawsuit, \ncommencing in 1973 and also in respect to the many months of settlement negotiations, \namply demonstrate the untimeliness of the May 1981 attempted intervention under this \nfirst Stallworth factor.[14] \nUnited Airlines and Piambino are each plainly inapposite here. Each involved a sudden, \ncomplete reversal of position by the representative, which, absent the allowance of \nintervention, would have legally bound the would-be intervenors. \nIn United Airlines the intervenor's rights would have been barred by limitations, since \navoidance of the bar depended on maintenance of the class action. The would-be \nintervenor had no notice of any impending settlement. The putative class representatives \nhad previously attempted to appeal the denial of class certification, but the appeal was held \npremature since prior to final judgment. The Supreme Court noted that because of this \n\"there was no reason for the respondent [would-be intervenor] to suppose that they [the \nputative class representatives] would not later take an appeal,\" 432 U.S. at 394, 97 S.Ct. at \n2469, and hence intervention for the sole purpose of obtaining appellate review of the \ndenial of class certification, id. at 392, 97 S.Ct. at 2468, was timely when sought within the \nperiod for notice of appeal (and virtually at the earliest time the sole purpose of the \nintervention, taking such an appeal, could be acted on). \nSimilarly, in Piambino a wholly meritorious appeal which had been undertaken with \"a \nsterling brief\" by parties on whom the would-be intervenor relied was suddenly wholly \n\nabandoned without warning despite 935*935 previous assurances \"that they were \nprosecuting the appeal diligently and in good faith,\" 610 F.2d at 1325, and a settlement \nwhich \"utterly destroyed\" the would-be intervenor's rights was entered into without notice or \nopportunity to participate in its formulation. \nHere, by contrast, the well-publicized settlement process dragged out over a year, and the \nultimate result, which does not bind the would-be intervenors, involves no violation of \nassurances or reversal of position adverse to them. Cf. United States v. Jefferson \nCounty, 720 F.2d 1511, 1516-17 (11th Cir.1983) (distinguishing United Airlines on similar \ngrounds in analogous case); Garrity v. Gallen, 697 F.2d 452, 458 (1st \nCir.1983) (distinguishing United Airlines on similar grounds). \nThe second Stallworth factor is prejudice to the existing parties. Prejudice to the United \nStates and the School Board is apparent. After nearly a year's negotiations they have finally \narrived at a complex, interrelated settlement and consent decree disposing of the lawsuit \nbetween the two of them. If, as she requests, Ms. Phillips is made a party, there can be no \nconsent decree without her agreement. Had Ms. Phillips intervened when she should have, \nshe could have contributed to the settlement process, and quite possibly an agreement — \nsurely different, and not necessarily only in ways favorable to Ms. Phillips' view, than the \npresent one — could have been reached. To do so now, after positions have hardened, \nconcessions here have been traded for those there, persons, groups, and institutions have \n\"gone on the line\" publicly, and months of effort and mobilization of community and citizen \ninvolvement have been expended, may be impossible. Whether impossible or not, all the \ntime, effort, and meetings will have been wasted, and the lengthy and difficult process will \nhave to begin all over again, from \"square one\" or worse.[15] The settlement here took longer \nand doubtless more effort than a trial would. Certainly having to retry a case is recognized \nas prejudicial. Cf. Piambino, 610 F.2d at 1325 (\"nor is it a case where more hearings must \nbe held in the lower court\"); McDonald v. E.J. Lavino Company, 430 F.2d 1065, 1071-73 \n(5th Cir.1970) (emphasizing that intervention being considered would not reopen litigation). \nIs not having to go through yet another, now perhaps futile, multimonth settlement \nnegotiation and community meeting process prejudicial? We have plainly recognized this \ncharacter of prejudice to existing parties in sustaining denial of intervention on grounds of \nuntimeliness. See, e.g., United States by Bell v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., 553 F.2d \n451, 453 (5th Cir.1977) (per curiam), cert. denied sub nom. United Steelworkers Justice \nCommittee v. United States, 435 U.S. 914, 98 S.Ct. 1467, 55 L.Ed.2d 505 (1978) \n(\"Intervention now for the purpose of challenging the consent agreement will prejudice the \nappellees by jeopardizing months of negotiations, causing substantial litigation expenses .... \nTo allow the applicants to intervene now would disrupt carefully considered proceedings.\"). \nSo have other courts. See e.g., United States v. Jefferson County, 720 F.2d 1511, 1517 \n(11th Cir.1983) (intervention \"would plainly have prejudiced the existing parties, since it \nwould have nullified these negotiations ...\"); Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d 15, 22 (1st \nCir.1980) (\"... prevent last minute disruption of painstaking work by the parties and the \ncourt\"); Garrity v. Gallen, 697 F.2d at 458 (same). As stated in Alaniz v. Tillie Lewis \nFoods, 572 F.2d 657, 659 (9th Cir.) (per curiam), cert. denied sub nom., Beaver v. \nAlaniz,439 U.S. 837, 99 S.Ct. 123, 58 L.Ed.2d 134 (1978): \n\"Intervention after entry of a consent decree is reserved for exceptional cases. \n\".... \n\n\"Appellants sought intervention two and one-half years after suit was filed; they either knew \nor should have known 936*936 of the continuing negotiations. The crux of appellants' \nargument is that they did not know the settlement decree would be to their detriment. But \nsurely they knew the risks. To protect their interests, appellants should have joined the \nnegotiations before the suit was settled. Appellants have not proved fraudulent \nconcealment. It is too late to reopen this action.\" (Footnote omitted.) \nSee also Garrity v. Gallen, supra at 455 (citing Alaniz). \nThe third Stallworth factor is prejudice to the would-be intervenor. Neither Ms. Phillips nor \nthe class she seeks to represent is bound by the Consent Decree, and she is free to file suit \nseeking further desegregation in the Caddo Parish school system, a matter which neither \nthe United States nor the Board has disputed.[16] It is also important to realize in this \nconnection that, so far as concerns the constitutional desegregation rights of Ms. Phillips \nand the class she seeks to represent, the Consent Decree is a floor, not a ceiling. It neither \ncommands action claimed to violate the constitutional rights of Ms. Phillips or the class, nor \nforbids action to which Ms. Phillips or the class claim constitutional 937*937 entitlement. In \nthis regard, the decree is materially different, with respect to the would-be intervenor, than \nthe decree in cases such as Stallworth or Thaggard v. City of Jackson, 687 F.2d 66 (5th \nCir.1982), cert. denied sub nom. Ashley v. City of Jackson, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 255, 78 \nL.Ed.2d 241 (1983).[17] See United States v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d 1147, 1151-53 (5th \nCir.1975) (denying intervention to minority employees to challenge employment \ndiscrimination consent decree between United States and employer where decree did not \nlimit minority employees' rights); Ross v. Houston Independent School District, 699 F.2d \n218, 229-30 (5th Cir.1983). Compare United States v. Jefferson County, 720 F.2d 1511, \n1518-19 (11th Cir.1983) (denying intervention to white employees to challenge consent \ndecree on grounds of reverse discrimination, since would-be intervenors were not bound). \nMoreover, in these circumstances, it is proper to \"put into the balance against the movant its \nprior opportunities to assert its position.\" United States v. Marion County School \nDistrict, 590 F.2d 146, 148 (5th Cir.1979). \nThe fourth and final Stallworth factor is \"unusual circumstances.\" Stallworth provides two \nexamples. First is the example of a would-be intervenor who, though \"he failed to apply for \nintervention promptly after he became aware of his interest in the case,\" nevertheless \nmakes a \"convincing\" showing \"that for reasons other than lack of knowledge he \nwas unable to intervene sooner.\" Id. at 266 (emphasis added). The second example is \nprovided by the facts of Stallworth itself, where the district court, at the black plaintiffs' \nrequest, refused to allow the defendant employer to notify its white employees of the \npendency and potential impact of the suit, which we characterized as \"an unusual \ncircumstance which tilts the scales toward a finding that the appellants' application was \ntimely.\" Id. at 267. Nothing remotely comparable to either of these factors is present here. \nIt is true that the black community, as such, did not have in-court representation in the later \nphases of this case. This circumstance may be unusual in a statistical sense, but it does not \nmilitate strongly in favor of intervention where, as here, it is so plainly the result of free, \ndeliberate choice. The black community has not been excluded. There is nothing secret or \nsudden about what has gone on. The black community has been involved and aware, this \nrecord reflects, at least since the biracial Citizens Committee was appointed and held public \n\nmeetings in 1973. From that time until 1981 the biracial Advisory Committee monitored \nimplementation of the 1973 plan. While the black community, as such, has not participated \nin the suit itself since January 1977 (and except for once then, not since 1974), that has \nplainly been its own free and deliberate choice. That choice does not justify one \nperson coming along after all this time and attendant publicity and seeking to upset a \nsettlement so long and so publicly in the making. If there is dissatisfaction, the courts \nremain open for another suit to seek additional desegregation, which is certainly not \nforbidden by the present decree. \nWhile we focus on Ms. Phillips' situation and her obvious long-standing relation to this case, \nit is plain that she seeks intervention not to advance any uniquely individual claim, but rather \nto assert essentially the viewpoint of that segment of the black community for whom the \n1973 would-be intervenors sought to speak. It cannot be gainsaid that that segment of the \nblack community has for many years known its interests were at stake, and that there might \nbe no more desegregation than that provided for in the 1973 decree, which is why they \nsought to intervene then. The plaintiffs, and \"their\" segment of the black community, \napproved the 1973 decree; 938*938 they have not challenged the Consent Decree and their \ndesegregative interests are not adversely affected since the Consent Decree, as all admit, \nis significantly more desegregative than the 1973 decree. \nMs. Phillips does not seek limited purpose intervention. What she in effect asked of the \ndistrict court, as she has of us, is full intervention and a completely new start. On the \nundisputed facts here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying her request. \nShe timely submitted her objections to the decree — which she has now essentially \nabandoned — and these were considered and ruled on by the district court. It is now simply \ntoo late to require her intervention. Under the circumstances, the time has come for the \nUnited States and the Board to be allowed to settle their suit. \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Ms. Phillips' application to \nintervene was untimely, and it accordingly did not err in denying her leave to intervene. \nTherefore, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of intervention as of right and DISMISS the \nappeal from the denial of permissive intervention. \nPATRICK E. HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge, specially concurring: \nWhile a strong argument can be made that the applicant for intervention was entitled to an \nevidentiary hearing before denial of her petition, it became plain in the en banc proceedings \nthat she wanted no such hearing.[1] Instead, she rests on the assertion that as a matter of \nlaw she is entitled to intervene. I reject that proposition, concluding that, if the facts are as \nthe applicant for intervention now concedes them to be, the district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in refusing intervention. \nI add this brief writing only to note that I share the concern for procedural regularity \nexpressed by Judge Rubin's opinion and earlier by Judge Goldberg; this concern, I think, is \nshared by the members of the court on both sides of this case. Thus, despite the division of \nthe court as to the outcome of this appeal, the case is a warning to courts struggling with \npublic law cases. Difficult legal questions, particularly in school cases, are magnified by \nfailure to adhere strictly to procedure. With these public law cases we are learning that the \n\nfastest path between two points is not a straight line. It is, instead, the sometimes tedious \nand seemingly tortuous path of procedural due process. \nSome school cases have proceeded in ways more akin to congressional hearings than \njudicial proceedings. The very nature of the cases with their changing class memberships \ndulls sensitivity to otherwise routine procedures — procedures so routine that we overlook \ntheir fundamental due process role. When Judge Stagg inherited this snarled mass, it had \nlost many of its judicial features, and was a breeding ground for just the sort of difficulties \nthis appeal has generated. Critically, failure to define the parties to this lawsuit in times past \nhas led to difficulty in achieving a final result. \nI am persuaded that, on balance, this record sufficiently reflects fundamental fairness and \nopportunity to be heard. Finally, if, as is the case, this uncertified \"class\" lacks sufficient \ndefinition as a jural entity to save a case from mootness, its \"absence\" from the negotiation \nof the consent decree cannot have unsettling consequences. \n939*939 ALVIN B. RUBIN, Circuit Judge, with whom CLARK, Chief Judge, GOLDBERG, \nRANDALL, TATE and JOHNSON, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting. \nWithout holding a hearing, the district court denied as untimely a motion on behalf of a class \nof black parents and children seeking to intervene in this long-pending school \ndesegregation case; the movant sought to object to a consent decree negotiated between \nattorneys for the United States Department of Justice and the School Board. The court also \ntreated the case, instituted as a class action, as not being a class action although it had \nnever held a class certification hearing as required by this court in a prior decision relating \nto the same case. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974). While \nthe failure to hold a class-certification hearing was due to the failure of counsel for the \nputative class to seek such a hearing, the class-action allegations should not have been \ndisregarded, and, once a consent decree was proposed, some formal action should have \nbeen taken on them. I would, therefore, remand the case for consideration of its class-\naction status and for a hearing on the motion to intervene. \nI. \nSeven black school children and their parents filed a complaint in 1965 charging that the \nCaddo Parish public schools were being operated on a segregated basis in violation of \nrights secured to them by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. They \nsought to represent themselves and a class of \"Negro children and their parents in Caddo \nParish,\" pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3) as then in effect. The case was assigned to \nDistrict Judge Ben C. Dawkins, Jr., who enjoined the operation of the dual school system \nand ordered the School Board to prepare a desegregation plan. After the School Board had \nsubmitted a proposal, the United States moved to intervene as a party plaintiff pursuant to \nTitle IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.[1] The district court adopted the School Board's plan \nand denied intervention by the United States. Both rulings were reversed by us in United \nStates v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir.1966), aff'd with \nmodifications, 380 F.2d 385 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied,389 U.S. 840, 88 S.Ct. 77, 19 \nL.Ed.2d 104 (1967). Since then, the United States has been an active participant. \n\nThe School Board thereafter prepared other plans. Each was approved by the district court \nand then disapproved by this court. See Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 417 F.2d \n801 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 904, 90 S.Ct. 218, 24 L.Ed.2d 180 (1969) (rejecting a \nfreedom of choice plan), and Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 421 F.2d 313 (5th \nCir.1970) (reversing the district court's approval of a plan submitted by the School Board \nand remanding for consideration of Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School \nDistrict, 419 F.2d 1211 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc), reversed, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 \nL.Ed.2d 530 (1970)). \nIn February 1972, plaintiffs filed a petition for further relief requesting the elimination of \nracially identifiable schools and professional staffs, and a declaration that the apportionment \nscheme for school board elections was unconstitutional. An amended motion for further \nrelief focused on the School Board's failure to dismantle \"schools with substantially \ndisproportionate racial compositions\" and sought the elimination of the remaining vestiges \nof the dual school system. The motion was signed by counsel who were associated with the \nNAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York City. The lawyer who appeared in this motion had \nnot represented the plaintiffs originally, but had been listed on some of the previous filings \nas being associated with other Legal Defense Fund attorneys. While these motions were \npending, Judge Dawkins recused himself from the case and it was assigned to Chief Judge \nNauman S. Scott. \n940*940 In March 1973, the United States responded to the motions for further relief by \nrequesting that the court appoint a biracial committee of citizens of Caddo Parish (\"the \nCommittee\") to assess the progress of the existing desegregation scheme and to develop \nalternate proposals. The district court ordered the establishment of such a committee, and \nthe Committee presented its report and desegregation plan on June 1, 1973. Shortly \nthereafter, plaintiffs filed their objections to the pupil assignment portion of the Committee's \nproposed method of desegregation. They also moved to add additional parties as plaintiffs. \nThe United States filed comments on the Committee plan, noting that the plan permitted the \ncontinued operation of thirty-four one-race or predominantly one-race schools. The United \nStates stated that it was unable to determine whether the plan was constitutional because \nthe plan did not, as required by court order, set forth facts that might justify continued \nexistence of one-race schools. \nThereafter plaintiffs' original counsel moved to dismiss the lawyers from the Legal Defense \nFund \"because of the objections [they] filed to the Court Appointed Citizens Committee \nDesegregation Plan.\" The court signed an order submitted by plaintiffs substituting as their \ncounsel yet another lawyer, who moved to strike the previously filed objections. About a \nweek later the court adopted the Committee's desegregation plan and directed that it be \nimplemented in time for the start of the 1973-74 school year. \nFour months later, the Legal Defense Fund lawyers filed a motion to intervene on behalf of \nseveral black school children and their parents who resided in Caddo Parish. The named \nindividuals sought to represent a \"class of present and future black public schoolchildren \nwho are or will be eligible to attend the public schools of Caddo Parish.\" They attached a \ncomplaint assailing the constitutionality of the Committee's pupil assignment plan for its \nretention of one-race schools within the parish. The district court denied the application for \nintervention, finding that the original plaintiffs adequately represented the class and that the \n\nmotion to intervene was untimely. This court vacated that decision and remanded the case \nfor an evidentiary hearing on the motion to intervene. Jones v. Caddo Parish School \nBoard, 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974). We instructed the district court to \"determine the class \nand who properly represents it.\" Id. at 917. However, no hearing was ever sought by the \nplaintiffs and none, therefore, was held. \nFor two years, there were no further legal proceedings and the Caddo Parish school system \noperated under the Committee's desegregation plan. In July 1976, the Citizens Advisory \nCommittee, a group appointed to oversee the implementation of the 1973 plan, filed a report \nwith the district court indicating several areas in which the School Board had not met the \nrequirements established by the plan. That report recommended a one-year extension of \nthe court order directing compliance with the 1973 Committee desegregation plan. After \nexamining data submitted by the School Board, Chief Judge Scott appointed a Special \nMaster \"for the specific purpose of investigating, examining and producing evidence to \nenable the Court to determine the degree of conformity achieved by the Caddo Parish \nSchool Board in satisfying the conditions and provisions of the [1973] plan.\" \nThe following month, the School Board filed a motion with the district court seeking a \ndeclaration that the Caddo Parish school system was unitary and dismissal of this action. \nOpposing this motion, the United States stated that any declaration of unitary status prior to \nthe completion of the Special Master's duties would be premature. The original plaintiffs, \nnow represented by yet another lawyer as counsel,[2] 941*941 also filed a memorandum in \nopposition to the School Board's motion. On December 30, 1977, after considering \ndeposition testimony, Judge Scott found that the \"former state-imposed dual system had \nbeen completely eradicated\" and declared the Caddo Parish school system \"a unitary \nsystem.\" The same day he signed a judgment dismissing the suit. \nNeither the United States nor the original plaintiffs appealed from this decision, but two \nweeks later the government moved to amend the district court's judgment and findings, \nclaiming that there had been procedural irregularities in the proceedings held by the Special \nMaster and substantive deficiencies in the determination that a unitary status had been \nachieved. No one appeared on behalf of the original plaintiffs. However, no action was \ntaken on the motion and the judgment of dismissal remained on the record. In July 1978, \nthe School Board requested that the district court lift the previously-imposed requirement \nthat the faculty ratio be fifty percent white and fifty percent black. The United States filed an \nopposition to the School Board's request for partial relief, but, again, no one appeared on \nbehalf of the original plaintiffs.[3] \nOn August 16, 1979, Chief Judge Scott recused himself and the case was transferred to a \nthird district judge, Judge Thomas E. Stagg (who has since succeeded Judge Scott as Chief \nJudge). It was evident that at least some of the litigants or their counsel had permitted the \ncase to languish. In both the public interest and the interest of the litigants, Judge Stagg \npromptly attempted to move the already-fourteen-year-old litigation to a conclusion. He \nconvened a status conference, but only counsel for the School Board and the government \nappeared, and no lawyer appeared to represent either the original plaintiffs or those seeking \nto intervene. The next day, June 3, 1980, the court entered a minute order that provided in \npart: \n\nIf the original plaintiffs still have a viable interest in this case, their counsel should contact \nthe court, in writing, within thirty (30) days of this order. If the plaintiffs' counsel does not \nrespond, this court will consider that the plaintiffs acquiesce in having their interests \nrepresented by the United States as plaintiff-intervenor. \nCopies of this were mailed to the many lawyers who had appeared in the past for, or who \nstill were shown as representing, both the original plaintiffs and those seeking to intervene. \nWhile responses were received, in one form or another, from several lawyers who had \nappeared at one time or another to represent the plaintiffs, none indicated a present interest \nin the case and none objected to \"having their [clients or former clients] represented by the \nUnited States as plaintiff-intervenor.\" No judgment based on the order was ever entered, no \nhearing was held with regard to the class action, no order with respect to the status of the \ncase was entered, and no notice was given either to any of the plaintiffs or to members of \nthe class. \nAt this point, the United States and the Caddo Parish School Board entered into \nnegotiations in an attempt to arrive at a settlement. In the course of these negotiations, \nwhich lasted for almost a year, none of the plaintiffs or their counsel attempted to \nparticipate. On May 5, 1981, the United States and the School Board signed a settlement \nagreement. Two days later, pursuant to a joint motion of these two parties, the district court \nentered a consent decree embodying that agreement. \nThe order approving the consent decree directed the clerk of the court to give public notice \nof the terms of the decree. The district court also set a ten-day period in which \"interested \nparties\" could file written objections to the decree. Within that period, the court received \nfifteen objections, one of which was filed by June Phillips. Her objection was confined to \nthe 942*942 failure of the decree to provide \"enrichment programs\" for black students at \nmany of the district's elementary schools. In addition, she specifically reserved \"the right to \nintervene in these proceedings on behalf of herself or on behalf of a class of Black persons \nwhose children will need\" enrichment programs. \nFour days after the period for filing objections had expired, Phillips filed a motion to \nintervene individually and on behalf of a class of black children in the Caddo Parish school \nsystem and their parents. Her petition alleged that there were numerous deficiencies in the \npupil assignment plan contained in the consent decree and requested that the district court \nset the decree aside. On May 27, Phillips filed a first supplemental motion to intervene. On \nJune 8, Phillips filed a second supplemental motion to intervene. That same day the United \nStates and the School Board filed separate responses to the objections to the consent \ndecree and memoranda opposing Phillips' attempt to intervene. \nThe district court denied Phillips' motion to intervene on June 17, 1981. It found both that \nher proposed intervention was untimely and that it failed to raise any issues that had not \npreviously been considered by the School Board and the United States. On July 2, the \ndistrict court overruled all objections to the consent decree. Phillips appeals from the denial \nof her intervention and the rejection of her objections to the consent decree. Taking the \nopposite tack from the parties to the consent decree, she does not seek merely a hearing. \nShe also seeks orders permitting her to intervene both individually and as a class \nrepresentative, setting aside the consent decree, directing the district court to appoint \n\nexperts to help formulate a new plan, and requiring all parties to file new plans \"with as \nmany alternative methods of desegregating the system as possible.\" \nII. CLASS ACTION \nIn its memorandum ruling denying Phillips' intervention, the district court found that \"this \naction, in its present posture, is not in fact a class action.\" The court reasoned that the \naction brought by the private plaintiffs, despite allegations of a \"class\" status, had never \nbeen certified as a class action and that the United States had never been designated as a \nclass representative. In describing the history of the case, the court noted that the original \nplaintiffs had not taken an \"active role in this litigation for some time,\" prior to June 1980, \nand that none of these plaintiffs or their counsel had responded to the June 3 minute entry. \nThe court therefore viewed the settlement negotiations and the resulting consent decree as \nthe efforts of the only two remaining parties, the School Board on one side and the United \nStates on the other. \nThe historical facts recited by the district court are clearly correct. However, the fact that \nnothing had been done about class certification did not ipso facto determine that this was \nnot a class action. \nThe June 3 minute entry neither purported to be nor was either a dismissal of the class \naction or a refusal to certify the plaintiffs as class representatives. While some of the \nlawyers who had appeared for the plaintiffs responded to the court that they were no longer \nin the case, none of them indicated to the court that the parties had been consulted by them \nor that the parties did not wish to prosecute the class action. The situation was much as if \nthe lawyers had withdrawn, leaving the plaintiffs in the lawsuit unrepresented. Thereafter, \nno further action was taken on this order. \nWhile the June 3 minute entry had stated, \"... this court will consider that the plaintiffs \nacquiesce in having their interests represented by the United States,\" the district court's \nopinion denying Phillips' intervention said: \nThe government has never been designated as a class representative, nor ... has it ever \n\"purported\" to represent a class. The government has \"represented\" parties in this case \nonly in the sense that it is \"entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the \naction\" 943*943 under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .... (Emphasis added.) \nAt least, however, until the court found that the government did not represent the original \nplaintiffs' interests, those plaintiffs might be justified in assuming that it was doing so. \nWhen the suit was filed, no class certification order was necessary. In 1966, Rule 23 was \namended to require the plaintiffs in a class action to apply for class certification. The \namendment applied to pending cases. Eight years later no action had been taken to certify \nthe class, so we ordered a class action hearing. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 \nF.2d 914, 917 (5th Cir.1974). Now, ten years after our mandate issued, there has still been \nno determination whether the action should be maintained as a class action. Rule 23(c)(1) \nprovides that the court shall make such a determination \"as soon as practicable after the \n\ncommencement of an action brought as a class action.\"[4] While it was the responsibility of \nthe parties to move for a hearing under Rule 23(c)(1), their failure to do so did not absolve \nthe district court of responsibility. It should have held a hearing sua sponte, even if only to \ndetermine whether the class representatives would fairly and adequately represent the \nclass. \"The trial court has an independent obligation to decide whether an action was \nproperly brought as a class action, even where neither party moves for a ruling on class \ncertification.\" McGowan v. Faulkner Concrete Pipe Co., 659 F.2d 554, 559 (5th \nCir.1981).[5] Especially when an appellate court has specifically ordered that a class action \nhearing be held, the district court should see that the class is either certified or that the suit \nis not properly maintainable as a class action. That hearing should now be held. \nOn occasion, the Supreme Court has held that a district court's failure to certify an action as \na class action deprives the case of its class action status. See Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 \nU.S. 308, 310 n. 1, 96 S.Ct. 1551, 1554 n. 1, 47 L.Ed.2d 810, 816 n. 1 (1976); Pasadena \nCity Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 430, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 2702, 49 L.Ed.2d \n599, 605 (1976); Board of School Commissioners v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 \nL.Ed.2d 74 (1975). Those cases, however, deal solely with mootness and do not purport to \ndetermine \"whether, for example, a court of appeals may treat an action as a class action in \nthe absence of formal certification by the district court.\" Baxter, 425 U.S. at 325 n. 1, 96 \nS.Ct. at 1561 n. 1, 47 L.Ed.2d at 825 n. 1 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Furthermore, in none of \nthose cases had an appellate court directed that a class certification hearing be held. \nI would not now decide the effect of possible certification of a class on the consent decree \nnegotiated by the United States and the School Board, an issue that has not been briefed or \nargued by the parties. \nIII. TIMELINESS OF INTERVENTION \nWhen the consent decree was presented to the district court, the court entered it without a \nhearing and allowed ten days in which post-entry objections could be filed. Within that time, \nPhillips filed objections reserving the right to intervene. On May 22, fifteen days after \npublication of the consent decree, she sought to intervene on behalf of a class of black \nparents and students. She thereafter filed supplemental 944*944 motions to intervene. \nWithout a hearing, the district court denied her intervention as untimely on its face. \nEven though factual allegations are not required by notice pleading,[6] Phillips' pleadings \ncontained allegations that sufficed to show both her interest in the litigation and the \ntimeliness of her assertion of it. She alleged that, although the June 3 minute entry \nappeared to have designated the United States as the sole representative of the class of \nblack students and their parents, the government had failed to protect their interests in \nnegotiating the consent decree. Phillips proposed to intervene to represent the class \nadequately. In her first supplemental motion to intervene, filed on May 27, Phillips further \nasserted that her intervention was timely because she had assumed that the United States \nwas adequately representing the black families of Caddo Parish until she learned the \ncontents of the consent decree — which she said she first learned during \"the week of May \n11, 1981 to May 15, 1981.\" She alleged that, sometime between November, 1980, and \nMarch, 1981, the United States had changed trial attorneys,[7] and that the new attorney had \n\nnot, to her knowledge, \"held any meetings in the Black community,\" nor had he \ncommunicated with her personally.[8] \nIf proved, these factual allegations, though unnecessary, would establish timeliness under \nthe well-settled law of this circuit. Indeed, in its brief on rehearing en banc the United States \n\"agrees that timeliness under Rule 24(a)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P., must be measured from the date \nthat the alleged inadequacy of representation first arose.\" \nThe Supreme Court has defined the timeliness requirement as being met when, \"as soon as \nit became clear to the respondent that the interests of the unnamed class members would \nno longer be protected by the named class representatives, she promptly moved to \nintervene to protect those interests.\" United Air Lines v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385, 394, 97 \nS.Ct. 2464, 2470, 53 L.Ed.2d 423, 432 (1977). Assuming, as we must at this stage in the \nproceedings, the truth of Phillips' allegations, she did just that. She was not required to do \nmore. Although in her first supplemental motion she attempted to negate the possible \ndefense that her intervention was untimely, she was not obliged to do so; such an issue \nmust be raised by the opponent as a defense and its merit is best determined in a hearing. \nOur timeliness standard follows United Air Lines. We have twice discussed the factors that \nought to be considered in making a timeliness determination. In Stallworth v. Monsanto \nCo., 558 F.2d 257, 264-66 (5th Cir.1977), and in Piambino v. Bailey, 610 F.2d 1306, 1320-\n21 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1011, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66 L.Ed.2d 469 (1980), we set \nthem forth as follows: \n(1) the length of time during which the would-be intervenor actually knew \nor 945*945 reasonably should have known of his interest in the case before he petitioned for \nleave to intervene; (2) the extent of the prejudice that the existing parties to the litigation \nmay suffer as a result of the would-be intervenor's failure to apply for intervention as soon \nas he actually knew or reasonably should have known of his interest in the case; (3) the \nextent of the prejudice that the would-be intervenor may suffer if his petition for leave to \nintervene is denied; and (4) the existence of unusual circumstances militating either for or \nagainst a determination that the application is timely. \nPhillips' allegations, if proved, would have established timeliness,[9] but the district court \ndenied her motion to intervene without granting her a hearing in which she could establish \ntheir verity or in which the School Board and the Justice Department might negate them. As \nwe have repeatedly held, such a hearing is a minimal step necessary to comport with due \nprocess. \nWhen parents move to intervene in school desegregation cases, the important constitutional \nrights at stake demand a scrupulous regard for due process considerations. Jones v. Caddo \nParish School Board, 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974). This court has determined that \nintervention, rather than a separate action, is the proper vehicle for parents claiming \ninadequate representation to assert their rights. Denial of a plea in intervention, therefore, \noften will deprive those parties of their only opportunity to be heard. Consequently, we \nadhere to our earlier decisions requiring the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing, \nand to enter findings based upon an adequate record. Jones v. Caddo Parish School \n\nBoard, 499 F.2d 914 (5th Cir.1974); Calhoun v. Cook, 487 F.2d 680 (5th Cir.1973). See \nalso United States v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277 (5th Cir.1978). \nAdams v. Baldwin County Board of Education, 628 F.2d 895, 897 (5th Cir.1980).[10] \nThe district court made what appears to be a factual finding concerning Phillips' failure to \nact timely: \"Surely she cannot contend that the extended and well-reported events of the \npast months escaped her notice.\" But Phillips does not appear to contend that she did not \nknow of the negotiations. She does contend that, until the consent decree was entered, she \nwas not aware of the inadequacy of the Justice Department's representation of her interests \nand those of the class she sought to represent. There was indeed no evidence concerning \nwhen Phillips first became aware that the Department allegedly no longer adequately \nrepresented her or the class's interests. \nThe district court's ruling that Phillips' intervention motion was untimely rested on narrow \ngrounds. The court simply noted that, because she failed to participate in formulation of the \nconsent decree, her efforts to \"second-guess\" that decree came too late. The district court \nthus focused on the one factor we have disapproved in Rule 24 timeliness decisions. \"[T]he \ntimely application requirement under Rule 24 was not intended to punish an intervenor for \nnot acting more promptly but rather was designed to insure that the original parties should \nnot be prejudiced by the intervener's [sic] failure to apply sooner.\" Note, The Requirement of \nTimeliness Under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 37 Va.L.Rev. 863, 867 \n(1951), quoted in McDonald v. E.J. Lavino Co., 430 F.2d 1065, 1074 (5th Cir.1970). \n946*946 The intervention effort cannot be held untimely solely because of the length of time \nthat had passed between the original filing of the suit and either the entry of the consent \ndecree or the filing of the motion to intervene. This sort of \"absolute\" measure of timeliness \nis a factor that we expressly said in Stallworth should be \"ignored.\" 558 F.2d at 266. See \nalso Reeves v. IT & T, 616 F.2d 1342, 1349 (5th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1077, 101 \nS.Ct. 857, 66 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981). \nIn United Airlines, the Supreme Court ruled that a party might intervene even after judgment \nfor the purpose of prosecuting an appeal that the named parties did not choose to pursue. \nIn both Piambino and Stallworth, we allowed parties to intervene after discovering, when \nconsent decrees were filed, that their interests were adversely affected. In Piambino, the \nintervention motion was filed seventeen days after the intervenor learned his interests were \nnot being adequately represented; in Stallworth, the delay was twenty-eight days. Phillips \ncontends that she did not learn of her interest until at least May 11; if that allegation is \nproved, her delay in moving to intervene amounts to only eleven days. Even if timeliness is \nmeasured from the entry of the consent decree on May 7, a delay of fifteen days is not \nunreasonable compared to those allowed in Piambino and Stallworth. \nIn addition, the district court made no findings on the three other factors Stallworth tells us \nto consider: prejudice to the existing parties; prejudice to the intervenor; and unusual \ncircumstances. \nConsideration of prejudice to existing parties if the intervention is allowed is critical. Indeed, \nin McDonald v. E.J. Lavino Co., 430 F.2d 1065, 1073 (5th Cir.1970), we explained that this \n\nwas \"the most important consideration\" and that \"courts are in general agreement that an \nintervention of right under Rule 24(a) must be granted unless the petition to intervene would \nwork a hardship on one of the original parties.\" Prejudice is the heart of the timeliness \nrequirement. \"[T]he prejudice ... that is relevant is only that prejudice which would result \nfrom the would-be intervenor's failure to request intervention as soon as he knew ... about \nhis interest in the action.\" Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 265.[11] Without a hearing, we cannot know \nwhether or not either the United States or the School Board would have been prejudiced at \nthe time intervention was sought. \nThe district court also did not address the prejudice that would result to Phillips and the \nclass she sought to represent if she were not permitted to intervene. Yet that is the third \nfactor identified by Piambino and Stallworth as minimally necessary to a resolution of the \ntimeliness question. To some extent, this prejudice is self-evident. The class was not \nrepresented in the final resolution of a lawsuit that will have a significant impact on the \neducation of its children. The United States was the only party even putatively adverse to \nthe School Board, and its status was that of a party plaintiff, not that of a representative of \nany class. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2 (1976). \nThe final timeliness factor that the district court must consider \nunder Stallworth and Piambino is the existence of special circumstances. This factor was \nalso pretermitted by the district judge's opinion. Although Phillips should have had the \nopportunity to present evidence on any special circumstances that might be present in the \ncase, at least one is obvious: the fact that this school desegregation case was resolved \nwithout any in-court representation of the black community of Caddo Parish. \nA hearing on the motion to intervene would have required little time. The \nmotion 947*947 might or might not have been granted. The district judge might have allowed \nPhillips to intervene either as a party or for the limited purpose of objecting to the consent \ndecree. If granted, Phillips' intervention would not necessarily have resulted in setting aside \nthe consent decree; it would have assured only that Phillips and the class she sought to \nrepresent had a chance to challenge the decree in court. \nThe Department urges, correctly, that even now Phillips has the right to file a new suit \ncontesting the consent decree and seeking changes in the Caddo Parish school \nsystem.[12] While she assuredly has that right, its exercise would be at least as dilatory and \neven more inefficient in securing an adjudication of her right to seek changes in the school \nsystem, and, should that be recognized, the merit or lack of merit of her position. The \npreferred course of action for parental groups who have an interest in desegregation \nlitigation is to intervene in a pending action, not to file separate lawsuits of their own. Hines \nv. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762, 765 (5th Cir.1973). In Hines, we sought to \nprevent the \"fostering [of] a multiplicity of new lawsuits over the same complicated and \nemotional issues which have already once been fought out in an all too lengthy court \nbattle.\" Id. That objective applies equally here. \nIV. ADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION \nOne of the requirements for intervention of right under Rule 24(a)(2), in addition to \ntimeliness, is that the movant's interests are not adequately represented by the existing \n\nparties. As an alternative ground for denying Phillips' motion to intervene, the district court \nheld that Phillips raised no new issues and that she raised no significant issue that she \ncould \"best represent.\" See Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762, 765 (5th \nCir.1973). This question of adequacy of representation, like that of timeliness, should not \nhave been resolved without a hearing. See Adams v. Baldwin County Board of \nEducation, 628 F.2d 895, 897 (5th Cir.1980). \nIn her motion and supplemental motions to intervene, Phillips raised several objections to \nthe consent decree, the most significant of which is that it does not adequately desegregate \nthe Caddo Parish school system because forty-seven percent of the black students remain \nin predominantly black schools. Without a hearing, the district court accepted the \ncontentions of the School Board and the government that Phillips' figures were \"inflated.\" \nDue process requires that Phillips be afforded a hearing at which she may offer evidence in \nsupport of her claims. \nLike many lawyers, Phillips' counsel sought more than we now allow: he urged 948*948 us \nsimply to permit intervention. He did not thereby waive Phillips' right to a hearing if we did \nnot grant her a whole-loaf of relief, and unlike my brother Higginbotham, I cannot view \ncounsel's pressing for complete victory as a waiver of Phillips' constitutional right to be \nheard. \nThe interests of Phillips and the United States cannot be considered identical simply \nbecause both seek desegregation. Clearly, Phillips is dissatisfied with the level of \nsegregation that the government is willing to accept. As in a previous round of this litigation, \nwe are faced with a putative class \"who desire the achievement of greater desegregation \nthan is necessary to satisfy plaintiffs [now, the United States as plaintiff-intervenor].\" Jones \nv. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914, 917 (5th Cir.1974). \nSome courts have imposed a heavier burden on a movant who alleges inadequate \nrepresentation by the government, as opposed to a private existing party. See 7A C. Wright \n& A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1909, at 528 n. 85 (1972), and cases cited \ntherein. But Phillips may meet that burden if she makes \"a concrete showing of \ncircumstances in the particular case that make the representation inadequate ... \n[I]ntervention will be allowed if ... for any ... reason it appears that the representative is not \nmaking a diligent effort to protect those whom he represents.\" Id. at 529-30 (footnotes \nomitted). An interest in a different sort of remedy from that the government desires is \nsufficient to support intervention of right.[13] Similarly, intervention of right may be allowed \nwhen the movant demonstrates greater enthusiasm than the government in pressing a \nparticular claim.[14] \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the case should be remanded to the district court with directions to hold \na hearing to determine whether it should be certified as a class action and whether Phillips \nshould be permitted to intervene. I, therefore, respectfully dissent. \n[*] Judge Goldberg, a senior judge of this circuit, is participating as a member of the panel initially deciding the appeal \n[704 F.2d 206] now subject to en banc review. 28 U.S.C. § 46(c). \n\nJudge Politz recused. \n[1] Former Rule 23(a)(3) provided: \n\"(a) Representation. If persons constituting a class are so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all \nbefore the court, such of them, one or more, as will fairly insure the adequate representation of all may, on behalf of \nall, sue or be sued, when the character of the right sought to be enforced for or against the class is ... (3) several, and \nthere is a common question of law or fact affecting the several rights and a common relief is sought.\" \nRule 23 as then in effect did not provide for class certification. However, Rule 23 was amended, effective July 1, \n1966, to include the present requirement of Rule 23(c)(1) for class certification. The amended rule applied to actions \npending on its effective date. See Hohmann v. Packard Instrument Co., 399 F.2d 711, 713 (7th Cir.1968); Alvarez v. \nPan American Life Insurance Co., 375 F.2d 992, 993 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 827, 88 S.Ct. 74, 19 L.Ed.2d \n82 (1967). See also Atlantis Development Corp. v. United States, 379 F.2d 818, 823 (5th Cir.1967). Nevertheless, no \nclass has ever been certified, nor any class representative appointed, in this case; nor has any hearing on such \nmatters been held (or requested by any party to the action). However, no complaint is made in any of these respects \non the present appeal. See note 16, infra. \n[2] 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2 provides: \n\"Whenever an action has been commenced in any court of the United States seeking relief from the denial of equal \nprotection of the laws under the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution on account of race, color, religion, sex or \nnational origin, the Attorney General for or in the name of the United States may intervene in such action upon timely \napplication if the Attorney General certifies that the case is of general public importance. In such action the United \nStates shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.\" \n[3] The order provided in relevant part: \n\"If the original plaintiffs still have a viable interest in this case, their counsel should contact the court, in writing, within \nthirty (30) days of this order. If the plaintiffs' counsel does not respond, this court will consider that the plaintiffs \nacquiesce in having their interests represented by the United States as plaintiff-intervenor.\" \n[4] The abuse of discretion standard has been applied innumerable times by this Court in sustaining district court \ndenial of intervention as untimely, see, e.g., Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 710 F.2d 1040, 1043 (5th Cir.1983); United States v. \nLouisiana, 669 F.2d 314, 315 (5th Cir.1982); United States by Bell v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., 553 F.2d \n451, 453 (5th Cir.1977) (per curiam), cert. denied sub nom. United Steelworkers Justice Committee v. United \nStates, 435 U.S. 914, 98 S.Ct. 1467, 55 L.Ed.2d 505 (1978), as well as in sustaining the district court's determination, \nin allowing intervention, that it was timely sought. Diaz v. Southern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d 1118, 1125 (5th Cir.), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Trefina A.G. v. United States, 400 U.S. 878, 91 S.Ct. 118, 27 L.Ed.2d 115 (1970). The district \ncourt's discretion in denying intervention as untimely is likewise recognized by other circuits. See, e.g., Michigan \nAssociation for Retarded Citizens v. Smith, 657 F.2d 102, 105 (6th Cir.1981); Garrity v. Gallen, 697 F.2d 452, 455 \n(1st Cir.1983); United States v. Jefferson County, 720 F.2d 1511, 1516 (11th Cir.1983). \n[5] Previously the plaintiffs, through associate counsel, attorneys connected with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, \nhad objected to the Committee plan and requested disapproval of its student assignment provisions because it would \nleave too many elementary and junior high schools \"racially identifiable,\" and had also moved to add as additional \nparties plaintiff several individual black students and their parents. Shortly thereafter the plaintiffs, through their \noriginal retained counsel, advised the court that they had discharged their Legal Defense Fund lawyers because of \nthe objections they had filed to the Committee plan, and the district court then entered an order removing the Legal \nDefense Fund attorneys as associate counsel for plaintiffs and substituting the new counsel for plaintiffs whom they \nhad requested in their motion. The objections to the plan were then stricken by the court on motion of plaintiffs \nthrough their new counsel. The court also denied the previous motion to add additional plaintiffs, without prejudice to \nits renewal by plaintiffs through their new counsel. It was not renewed. The United States took no position respecting \nany of these matters. \n[6] The record reflects that in November 1976 \"June Phillips, Professor, Southern University, Shreveport,\" was \nsubpoenaed \"as a witness to assist the Government at counsel table during the taking of depositions\" in these \nproceedings. Concededly, this refers to our appellant. \n\n[7] The memorandum ruling notes that the Advisory Committee \"composed of six blacks and six whites, has been in \nsession constantly and regularly since the implementation of the plan\" and \"has held regular meetings and worked \nwith the School Board through the four year existence of the plan.\" It also states that the School Board is elected from \nsingle-member districts and is composed of fourteen white and four black members, with a white president and black \nvice president, and that recently a \"black, a woman teacher at Southern University\" was appointed to the Board, by \nvote of its members, to fill a vacancy. Ms. Phillips' counsel, in argument to this Court, has acknowledged that she \nserved on the School Board, and it is apparent that Ms. Phillips is the person who was so appointed. See note \n6, supra. \n[8] In July 1978 the Board filed a motion for partial relief from the 1973 plan, to which the United States filed a \nresponse urging that the Board's motion not be ruled on until the United States' January 1978 motion was \ndetermined. No hearing or ruling was ever had on these motions. \n[9] We do not understand Ms. Phillips to claim otherwise. Certainly she has never questioned the numerous public \nmeetings, or the fact that it was well-known that settlement negotiations were underway. The most she has claimed in \nthis connection is that one particular individual Justice Department attorney (whom the record shows became head \nlitigation counsel for the United States in November 1980 and whom Ms. Phillips alleged she believed primarily \nrepresented the United States in negotiating the decree) \"never contacted\" her and \"to petitioner's knowledge ... \nnever held any meetings in the Black community.\" This particular attorney verified the United States' response to Ms. \nPhillips' motion to intervene, specifying dates, places and attendees (not including Ms. Phillips) of occasions at \nwhich he met with representatives of the black community to receive their input into the settlement negotiation \nprocess. Moreover, as the record reflects, there were several other government attorneys active on the case. Indeed \nMs. Phillips alleges that prior to the assignment of the above-referenced attorney another Justice Department \nattorney (whom she believed the above-referenced attorney replaced), who was black, had \"obtained input\" from her \nand \"held meetings in the Black community.\" She alleges no character of representations or assurances, express or \nimplied, by this attorney (or anyone else). \n[10] We do not regard this as a matter of material dispute. Ms. Phillips alleged she \"did not learn of the contents of the \nConsent Decree until the week of May 11, 1981 to May 15, 1981.\" The Board in its filings below and in this Court has \nstated that the decree was promptly published in its entirety in both local newspapers and widely publicized on \ntelevision. On oral argument to this Court Ms. Phillips' attorney initially asserted that the decree \"went in the \nnewspaper like a news article\" rather than verbatim in its entirety; however, he subsequently stated, \"Now I think the \nConsent Decree may have been published in toto in the newspaper,\" but, respecting the order allowing ten days to \nobject, \"if that order was published, I don't know about it. I haven't seen it.\" However, the Consent Decree itself also \ncontains the ten-day objection period provision. In any event, Ms. Phillips has never contended, here or below, that \nthe decree was inadequately publicized or that there was any material fact issue in that regard for which a hearing \nshould be held. \n[11] In oral argument to this Court counsel stated, \"I will concede that Ms. Phillips knew about the 1973 consent \ndecree. She was on the Caddo Parish School Board at one time. She taught in the system.\" \n[12] Indeed, Ms. Phillips' intervention states that the 1973 plan \"did little for The Class which plaintiff [Ms. Phillips] \nseeks to represent,\" that \"[t]he Class which she seeks to represent has not been well served by most of the actions of \nthis court since the original filing of this suit,\" and that \"... the United States is supposed to represent all citizens of the \nUnited States and not the interests of any one group, including The Class which plaintiff [Ms. Phillips] seeks to \nrepresent.\" \n[13] See also e.g., Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d 15, 21 (1st Cir.1980) (\"While, as alleged by the ... [would-be \nintervenors], knowledge of a suit is not necessarily knowledge of one's interest, in this instance, the existence of [the] \ninterest was obvious, see Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d at 264, and the only lack related to its extent, a \nmatter of degree, not of kind.\"); United States v. Jefferson County, 720 F.2d 1511, 1516 (11th Cir.1983). \n[14] See, e.g., NAACP v. New York, supra (New York Times article and \"public comment by community \nleaders\"); Garrity v. Gallen, 697 F.2d 452, 456 (1st Cir.1983) (media coverage); Michigan Association for Retarded \nCitizens v. Smith, 657 F.2d 102, 105 (6th Cir.1981) (\"... this case has generated a great deal of public concern and \nscrutiny, and has thus received extensive media coverage\"); Culbreath v. Dukakis, 630 F.2d 15, 21 (1st \nCir.1980) (media coverage). \n\n[15] Prejudice to the United States as plaintiff is present in yet another way — it now has relief it is willing to accept, \nbut if intervention is allowed it will no longer be assured of this, it will almost certainly not get exactly what it now has, \nand will in any event have to either get out of the suit or expend a great deal of further time and effort on it. \n[16] The only parties to the Consent Decree are the United States and the Board and neither purports to be a party or \nsignatory for or on behalf of anyone else or any class. The decree does not purport to speak to or govern the rights or \nobligations of any class or anyone else other than the Board and the United States. The decree provides: \n\"... it will be binding upon and shall have the effect of law with respect to the United States and its agencies, officers, \nagents and employees, and the Board and its officers, agents and employees.\" \nThe memorandum approving the decree states that \"this case is not a class action\" and that the only parties to the \naction are the United States and the School Board. Clearly the decree is not binding on anyone other than the United \nStates and the Board. See General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 333, 100 S.Ct. 1698, 1707, 64 L.Ed.2d \n319 (1980); United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum, 517 F.2d 826, 845 (5th Cir.1975), cert. denied sub nom., 425 U.S. \n944, 96 S.Ct. 1684, 48 L.Ed.2d 187 (1976)(the \"class,\" not being a party, is not \"bound by res judicata or estoppel to \nthe consent decrees\"); Rodriguez v. East Texas Motor Freight, 505 F.2d 40, 65 (5th Cir.1974), vacated on other \ngrounds, 431 U.S. 395, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 52 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977); Pearson v. Ecological Science Corp., 522 F.2d 171 \n(5th Cir.1975), cert. denied sub nom. Skydell v. Ecological Science Corp., 425 U.S. 912, 96 S.Ct. 1508, 47 L.Ed.2d \n762 (1976); United States v. Board of Education of Chicago, 88 F.R.D. 679, 683 (N.D.Ill.1981). Cf. W.R. Grace & Co. \nv. Local 759, 461 U.S. 757, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983). \nThe district judge correctly ruled that when Ms. Phillips sought intervention the case was not a class action. The \nConsent Decree does not purport to be a class judgment or to bind any class; nor does the order approving it. No \nparty to the suit has ever requested a class certification order (or hearing); no one has ever been appointed class \nrepresentative (the United States has never been appointed class representative, nor has it ever acted or purported \nto act as such, as the district court correctly found); there has never been any class certification. See note 1, supra. In \nthese circumstances, \"the action is not properly a class action.\" Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 310 n. 1, 96 \nS.Ct. 1551, 1554 n. 1, 47 L.Ed.2d 810 (1976); Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 430, 96 \nS.Ct. 2697, 2702, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976); Indianapolis School Comm'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 \nL.Ed.2d 74 (1975). In Baxter Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, expressed disagreement with the majority's \n\"not properly a class action\" categorization, id. at 325 n. 1, 96 S.Ct. at 1561 n. 1, but of course we must look to the \nmajority's statement. The doctrine that actions where there is no class certification and the judgment does not purport \nto be a class judgment are not class actions is not confined to mootness cases. See, e.g., Lagorio v. Board of Trade \nof City of Chicago, 529 F.2d 1290, 1291 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. 3171, 49 L.Ed.2d 1187 \n(1976); Davis v. Romney, 490 F.2d 1360, 1366 (3d Cir.1974). No complaint has been made of lack of class \ncertification, and the district court cannot properly be faulted in this respect by reason of our prior opinion where the \nreference to class certification determination was clearly made in the context of the intervention hearing which we \nheld the would-be intervenors were entitled to. Jones v. Caddo Parish School Board, 499 F.2d 914, 917-18 (5th \nCir.1974) (per curiam). When thereafter the would-be intervenors failed to request a hearing for over six years, and \nthe only action the named plaintiffs took in the suit was the filing of a memorandum in January 1977, the district court \nsurely cannot be said to have violated our mandate. Cf. United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314, 315 (5th Cir.1982). \nFurther, we have held that notice to the class of denial of class certification is not necessary. See Pearson v. \nEcological Science Corp., 522 F.2d at 176-77. See also McGowan v. Faulkner Concrete Pipe Co., 659 F.2d 554, \n558-59 (5th Cir.1981) (by implication). \n[17] But see, as to the permissible scope of preclusion in any event, opinion of Justice Rehnquist, concurred in by \nJustice Brennan, dissenting from denial of certiorari in Ashley v. City of Jackson, supra, and United States v. \nJefferson County, 720 F.2d 1511, 1518-19 & n. 20 (11th Cir.1983) (adopting analysis \"paralleling\" that of Justice \nRehnquist's opinion in Ashley). \n[1] Phillips's original brief identified remand for a hearing as one option open to the court — the other two being an \norder vacating the consent decree and granting intervention, and a ruling in favor of the school board — but opined \nthat such a hearing would be \"a total waste of time.\" Phillips's second supplemental brief incorporates by reference \nthe pleadings of her original brief and then specifically requests, inter alia, an order granting intervention; remand for \na hearing on intervention is not listed even as an alternative form of requested relief. Finally, Phillips's fourth \nsupplemental brief declares that such a hearing would be \"a waste of judicial energy.\" From these statements we are \nentitled to infer that Phillips desires no hearing on intervention. I would not find that the trial court abused its discretion \nin denying what Phillips characterizes as a \"total waste of time.\" \n\n[1] 42 U.S.C. § 2000h-2. \n[2] Why this lawyer appeared on behalf of the plaintiffs is not stated in the record. On September 15, 1976, he filed a \nnotice of appearance as counsel and four months later he signed the memorandum in opposition to the School \nBoard's motion. The memorandum does not refer to the lawyer who had previously appeared as original plaintiffs' \ncounsel. \n[3] The United States eventually moved to withdraw its objection to the School Board's request for partial relief on \nMay 7, 1981, after the two parties had negotiated a consent decree. The court granted the United States' motion. \n[4] See Manual for Complex Litigation § 1.40, at 16 (5th ed. 1978) (\"The mandatory language of Rule 23(c)(1) is \nbased upon sound and urgent practical considerations. If the determination whether the action should proceed as a \nclass action is delayed, serious injustices may result, and avoidable procedural errors of great magnitude may \nensue.\") \n[5] See 7A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1785, at 128 (1972); see also Manual for Complex \nLitigation, supra note 5, § 1.40, at 16 (\"If class action proceedings are initiated by the court sua sponte by means of \nan order to show cause, in determining the certification question, the court should make tentative written \ndeterminations, including the requisite findings of fact under subdivisions (a) and (b) of Rule 23 and should, in an \nevidentiary hearing, afford the opposing party or parties an opportunity to refute such findings.\") (footnote omitted). \n[6] Rule 24 states the procedure for intervention: \"A person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion to intervene \nupon the parties.... The motion shall state the grounds therefor and shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth \nthe claim or defense for which intervention is sought.\" \n[7] The record shows that the United States changed trial attorneys in November 1980. \n[8] The United States and the School Board assert that in February, March, and April of 1981, a number of public \nmeetings were held throughout the community to inform citizens about various desegregation approaches and to \nallow for community participation. The United States further asserts that Justice Department representatives met with \nblack civic leaders and solicited the views of black citizen and parent groups. Whether such meetings were in fact \nheld is a factual question that should have been resolved at an evidentiary hearing. Another disputed question of fact \nis the extent to which the consent decree was publicized after it was entered. The School Board contends that it was \npublished in its entirety in the two local newspapers and was covered by three local television stations. Phillips denies \nthis. \nEven if the allegations of the School Board and the United States were proved, Phillips' motion would not necessarily \nbe untimely. The ultimate question for the district court would be when she knew or should have known that her \ninterests were not adequately represented. \n[9] Accord Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 710 F.2d 1040, 1044 (5th Cir.1983). Other circuits have also recognized this as the \ncrucial test in class actions. See Hill v. Western Electric Co., 672 F.2d 381, 386 (4th Cir.1982); Legal Aid Society v. \nDunlop, 618 F.2d 48, 50 (9th Cir.1980). \n[10] Cf. Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Board, 721 F.2d 1425 (5th Cir.1983) (parents' motion to intervene \nin school desegregation case denied after hearing); United States v. Perry County Board of Education, 567 F.2d 277 \n(5th Cir.1978) (when parents sought to intervene on grounds unrelated to desegregation, district court properly \ndenied intervention without a hearing). \n[11] The district judge did not explicitly address the question of prejudice, but he did refer to the disruption Phillips' \nintervention would cause after \"the months of turmoil and negotiations carried on by the parties.\" Even assuming that \nthis is an oblique evaluation of prejudice to the existing parties, the court could not properly address the question of \nprejudice until it had first determined, on the basis of evidence, when Phillips knew or should have known that her \ninterests were adequately represented; the two inquiries are intertwined. \n[12] Because the only parties to the consent decree are the United States and the School Board, neither Phillips nor \nthe class she seeks to represent are bound by the decree. Cf. General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 100 \nS.Ct. 1698, 64 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980) (when EEOC sues employer in its own name, and not as certified representative \n\nof a class, individual employees are not bound by relief obtained under EEOC settlement or judgment against \nemployer). Nor would a separate lawsuit filed by Phillips necessarily be barred by Thaggard v. City of Jackson, 687 \nF.2d 66 (1982), cert. denied sub nom., Ashley v. City of Jackson, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 255, 78 L.Ed.2d 241 \n(1983). In Thaggard, a group of white plaintiffs sued the city of Jackson, contending that the city practiced reverse \ndiscrimination. The city answered that the challenged practices were mandated by consent decrees entered in \nprevious employment discrimination cases. The white plaintiffs had been denied intervention in those cases. We held \nthat the white plaintiffs' suit against the city was an impermissible collateral attack upon the consent decrees. We \nfound that the white plaintiffs' claims in Thaggard would have required the court to decide, first, whether the \nchallenged actions were in compliance with the consent decrees, and second, whether the consent decrees \nthemselves were illegal. If Phillips were to file a separate lawsuit against the School Board, however, her complaint \npresumably would be directed, not at segregation caused by the consent decree, but at segregation that preexisted \nthe consent decree and was not remedied by it. Cf. Ross v. Houston Independent School District, 699 F.2d 218, 229-\n30 (5th Cir.1983) (denial of leave to amend pleading on grounds of undue delay does not bar filing of new suit raising \nissues asserted in proposed amendment). \n[13] Cf. Cohn v. EEOC, 569 F.2d 909, 911 (5th Cir.1978) (intervention allowed when government's interest was in \ncontesting contempt for violating consent decree, and movants' interests were in narrowing range of possible \nsanctions). \n[14] See United States v. Georgia, 428 F.2d 377 (5th Cir.1970) (in school desegregation suit brought by United \nStates, community residents allowed to intervene to attack parts of order that United States failed to appeal). \n ",
