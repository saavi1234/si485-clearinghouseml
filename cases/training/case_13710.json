The cases identified herein all stem from an incident on September 24, 2011 wherein the plaintiffs allege they were pepper-sprayed/and or arrested by a member of the NYC Police Department. The City believes that all of the cases arising from the September 24, 2011 incident should be accepted by Your Honor as cases related to the Elliot matter, and should further be consolidated for discovery, much the same as the cases arising out of the 2003 anti-war demonstration.

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages, lawyers fees, and injunctive relief requiring that the city of New York create and implement a policy regarding the use of force upon persons involved in public demonstrations that conforms with federal constitutional standards and to create and implement reporting systems to record all uses of force by NYPD officers during public demonstrations on 7/31/2012. He claimed that his first, fourth, and fourteenth amendment rights were violated. </p><p>Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that he was sprayed with pepper spray by a New York City police officer while compliantly demonstrating with the Occupy Wall Street protest group. He said that the pepper spray hit his right eye and burned his face, arms, hands, and lungs. He claimed that he had to miss three days of work as a result of this incident, and still experienced some blurry vision and nervousness and increased heart rate around police officers.</p><p>On November 13th, 2012, the District Court (Judge Robert W. Sweet) consolidated this case with several others filed with regards to the same incident including <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13708\">Lawler v. City of New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14787\">Elliot v. City of New York</a>.</p><p>Following multiple settlement conferences, the parties reached a settlement agreement on July 8, 2015. The court entered the stipulation and dismissed the case on July 23, 2015, retaining jurisdiction over the matter for the purpose of enforcing the agreement for an undisclosed amount of time.</p><p>The details of the settlement are not publicly available. According to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/nyregion/new-york-city-reaches-settlements-for-6-pepper-sprayed-occupy-wall-street-protesters.html\">The New York Times</a>, the defendant paid a total of $332,500 in damages  (between $52,000 to $60,000 to each plaintiff). Additionally, the New York Times reported that the NYPD released a statement saying that the NYPD has not altered its pepper spray guidelines.</p>",

Yet it is \noften  only  with  hindsight  that  we  can  distinguish  those \ntroublemakers who brought us to our senses from those who were \nsimply…troublemakers.  Prudence,  and  respect  for  the \nconstitutional rights to free speech and free association, therefore \ndictate that the legal system cut all non-violent protesters a fair \namount of slack.” Garcia v. Bloomberg, 11-CV-6957 (JSR), 2012 \nWL 2045756, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 7, 2012) \n \n  Plaintiff DAMIEN CRISP, by his attorney DAVID B. RANKIN of Rankin & Taylor, \nPLLC, as and for his complaint, hereby states and alleges: \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This is a civil rights action brought to vindicate plaintiff’s rights under the First, Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, through the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, as amended, codified as 42 U.S.C. § 1983, with pendant claims under the \nConstitution and laws of the State of New York. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 2 of 38\n2.  Plaintiff DAMIEN CRISP’s rights were violated on September 24, 2011, when officers of \nthe NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT (“NYPD”) unconstitutionally and without \nany legal basis used gratuitous, unlawful force against him. By reason of defendants’ actions, \nincluding their unreasonable use of force, Mr. CRISP was deprived of his constitutional and \ncommon law rights. \n3.  Mr. CRISP also seeks an award of compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. \n4.  Mr. CRISP also seeks injunctive relief in the form of a permanent injunction requiring the \nCITY OF NEW YORK to create and implement a policy regarding the use of force upon \npersons involved in public demonstrations that conforms with federal constitutional standards \nand to create and implement reporting systems to record all uses of force by NYPD officers \nduring public demonstrations, with the Court to retain jurisdiction of this matter to ensure \n \ncompliance by the defendants.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, \n1343 (3-4). This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988 for violations of Mr. \nCRISP’s rights under the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. \n6.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Mr. CRISP’s claims against defendants under \nthe Constitution and laws of the State of New York because they are so related to the federal \nclaims that they form part of the same case or controversy pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \n7.  Pursuant to New York State General Obligations Law § 50-G, on or about October 11, 2011, \nMr. CRISP filed a timely Notice of Claim with the New York City Comptroller within ninety \n(90) days of the events herein complained of. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 3 of 38\n8.  None of Mr. CRISP’s claims have been adjusted by the New York City Comptroller’s Office. \n9.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 in that Mr. CRISP’s claims arose in the \nSouthern District of New York. \n10. An award of costs and attorneys’ fees is authorized pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nPARTIES \n11. Plaintiff DAMIEN CRISP is, and was at all times relevant to this action, a resident of the \nState and County of New York. \n12. Defendant  THE  CITY  OF  NEW  YORK  (“CITY”)  is  a  municipal  entity  created  and \nauthorized under the laws of the State of New York. It is authorized by law to maintain a \npolice department which acts as its agent in the area of law enforcement and for which it is \nultimately responsible. Defendant CITY assumes the risks incidental to the maintenance of a \npolice  force  and  the  employment  of  police  officers  as  said  risks  attach  to  the  public \nconsumers of the services provided by NYPD. \n13. Defendant JOSEPH ESPOSITO is and was at all times the Chief of the NYPD Department \nand is responsible, in whole and/or in part, for the creation, implementation, promulgation \nand enforcement of the policies, practices and/or customs complained of herein. He is sued in \nhis individual and official capacities. \n14. Defendants New York City Police Department INSPECTOR ANTHONY BOLOGNA, and \nOFFICER  JOHN DOE 1 through OFFICER  JOHN DOE 42  are and were at  all times \nrelevant herein, officers, employees and agents of the NYPD. The individual defendants are \nbeing sued herein in their individual and official capacities. \n15. At all times relevant herein, the individual defendants were acting under color of state law in \nthe course and scope of their duties and functions as agents, servants, employees and officers \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 4 of 38\nof NYPD, and otherwise performed and engaged in conduct incidental to the performance of \ntheir lawful functions in the course of their duties. They were acting for and on behalf of the \nNYPD at all times relevant herein, with the power and authority vested in them as officers, \nagents and employees of the NYPD and incidental to the lawful pursuit of their duties as \nofficers, employees and agents of the NYPD. \n16. The  true  names  and  shield  numbers  of  defendants  OFFICER  JOHN  DOE  1  through \nOFFICER JOHN DOE 421 are not currently known to Mr. CRISP. However, all of said \ndefendants are employees or agents of the NYPD. Accordingly, said defendants are entitled \nto representation in this action by the New York City Law Department (“Law Department”) \nupon their request, pursuant to N.Y. G.O.L. § 50-E. The Law Department, then, is hereby put \non notice (a) that Mr. CRISP intends to name said officers as defendants in an amended \npleading once their true names and shield numbers become known to Mr. CRISP and (b) that \nthe Law Department should immediately begin preparing their defense in this action. \n17. Defendants’ acts hereafter complained of were carried out intentionally, recklessly, with \nmalice and gross disregard for Mr. CRISP’s rights. \n18. At all relevant times, the defendants were engaged in a joint venture, assisting each other in \nperforming the various actions described herein and lending their physical presence and \nsupport and the authority of their offices to one another. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n19. The events herein complained of occurred principally in the vicinity of Union Square Park in \nthe County of New York on the afternoon of September 24, 2011, where Mr. CRISP was \nmarching in support of the then-nascent Occupy Wall Street movement. \n                     \n1   By using the name “John Doe,” Mr. CRISP is making no representations as to the gender of the officer. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 5 of 38\n20. Persons associated with Occupy Wall Street come from different backgrounds, including \nelderly  and  young  people,  those  with  college  and  graduate  degrees  and  those  without \ninstitutional schooling, and those with jobs and those who were laid off and are otherwise \nunemployed. These people come from all racial and ethnic groups and many religions. \n21. A central tenet of Occupy Wall Street is that the growing income inequality in the United \nStates is unjust, unacceptable, and must be rectified. Occupy Wall Street has petitioned the \ngovernment  to  redress  this  grievance  through  demonstrations  in  New  York  City  and \nthroughout the country and the world. \n22. Mr. CRISP first participated in an Occupy Wall Street event on September 17, 2011 when he \nvisited Liberty Plaza, the center for organizing for Occupy Wall Street, and attended a \ngeneral assembly, Occupy Wall Street’s decision-making body. Between September 17 and \n24, 2011, Mr. CRISP spent time in Liberty Plaza daily. \n23. On September 24, 2011, Mr. CRISP joined other Occupy Wall Street demonstrators in \nLiberty Plaza Park for a march in support of the movement. He was part of the march when it \narrived in Union Square Park. \n24. Upon information and belief, at approximately noon on September 24, 2011, in the vicinity \nof Union Square Park, officers of the NYPD, including at least some of the individual \ndefendants, were deployed to the site of protected First Amendment activity, namely, a \nmarch of at least one thousand people in support of the then-nascent Occupy Wall Street \nmovement. \n25. When the march arrived in the vicinity of Broadway and 14th Street, it was met by scores of \nthe DOE officers with orange nets. \n26. Upon information and belief, pursuant to customary practice, CHIEF ESPOSITO would have \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 6 of 38\nto receive notice of, and give consent for, the use of orange nets to stop, re-route and/or \ndetain persons participating in the march near Union Square Park. Upon information and \nbelief,  CHIEF  ESPOSITO  personally  authorized  the  use  of  orange  netting  against \ndemonstrators in and around Union Square Park. \n27. While Mr. CRISP and other demonstrators were inside Union Square Park, NYPD officers \ndeployed nets across 14th Street, the southern boundary of the park. \n28. Mr. CRISP stayed in Union Square for approximately 15 minutes after officers deployed the \nnets.  He  then  walked  south  to  University  Place  and  12th  Street  with  a  group  of  other \ndemonstrators.  \n29. Mr. CRISP walked south on University Place, until OFFICER DOE 1 through OFFICER \nDOE 20 deployed orange netting across University Place and forced Mr. CRISP and others \nto go west onto 12th Street’s northern sidewalk.  \n30. After he turned the corner of 12th Street and University Place and walked west approximately \n100 feet, Mr. CRISP saw approximately 20 or more police officers – OFFICER DOE 21 \nthrough OFFICER DOE 40 – holding a net about 30 feet west from the corner of 12th Street \nand University Place. This net spanned the length of both the street and the sidewalk, making \npassage west impossible.  \n31. The DOE officers used orange nets to completely surround a group of people, including Mr. \nCRISP, on the north sidewalk of 12th Street. \n32. While surrounded by the netting, Mr. CRISP observed officers using unprovoked force \nagainst demonstrators and bystanders alike. Mr. CRISP joined a group that was verbalizing a \nrequest for officers to stop and chanting, “The whole world is watching.” \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 7 of 38\n33. While  Mr.  CRISP  was  standing  on  the  sidewalk  trapped  inside  the  nets,  INSPECTOR \nBOLOGNA deployed his pepperspray directly into the group of demonstrators, including \nMr. CRISP. \n34. INSPECTOR BOLOGNA’s pepperspray went directly into Mr. CRISP’s right eye from a \ndistance of three-to-five feet. The pepperspray went into Mr. CRISP’s lungs and burned the \nskin on his face, arms and hands. 2 \n35. OFFICER DOE 41 and OFFICER DOE 42 were in the immediate vicinity of Mr. CRISP, the \norange nets, and INSPECTOR BOLOGNA when BOLOGNA approached the area with a \ncan of pepperspray in his hand. Any reasonable observer, including OFFICER DOE 41 and \nOFFICER  DOE  42  would  have  known  INSPECTOR  BOLOGNA  intended  to  use  his \npepperspray  against  compliant  demonstrators  who  were  already  detained  in  the  orange \nnetting. Nevertheless, neither OFFICER DOE 41 nor OFFICER DOE 42 did anything to \nprevent INSPECTOR BOLOGNA from using such force despite its obvious unlawfulness. \n36. Immediately upon being hit with INSPECTOR BOLOGNA’s pepperspray, Mr. CRISP felt a \nsearing, burning sensation in and around his eyes and face. The pain spread across his nose to \nhis left eye from his right.  \n37. Mr. CRISP’s started to have difficulty breathing and experienced an abnormal heartbeat after \nbeing hit with INSPECTOR BOLOGNA’s pepperspray.  \n38. Mr. CRIP’s eyes continued to intensely burn and were swollen for at least the next hour. He \ncontinued to have eye problems for approximately the next two weeks. He had problems \nfocusing his vision and an inflamed sty.  \n                     \n2   Pepper spray, also known as OC spray, can cause “temporary blindness which lasts from 15–30 minutes, a \nburning sensation of the skin which lasts from 45 to 60 minutes, upper body spasms which force a person to bend \nforward and uncontrollable coughing making it difficult to breathe or speak for between 3 to 15 minutes.” See \nEuropean Parliament Scientific and Technological Options Assessment, “An Appraisal of Technologies of Political \nControl” (1998), available online at http://aei.pitt.edu/5538/1/5538.pdf (last accessed on June 12, 2012). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 8 of 38\n39. Mr. CRISP had to miss work three days of work because he had trouble seeing. He was \ntreated at the New York Eye and Ear infirmary, where he received steroids as treatment for \nhis eyes.  \n40. Mr. CRISP was not formally arrested or charged with any crime or violation of any law in \nconnection with the events of September 24, 2011. \n41. As a result of defendants’ conduct alleged herein, Mr. CRISP becomes nervous when he is \nnear police officers and experiences an abnormal heartbeat and breathing.  \n42. As  a  result  of  defendant’s  conduct  alleged  herein,  Mr.  CRISP  has  approximately  daily \noccurrences of blurry vision.  \n43. As a result of the defendants’ conduct alleged herein, Mr. CRISP was compelled to miss at \nleast three full days of work, for which he had to forego pay.  \nFIRST CLAIM \nDEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS \nUNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THROUGH 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n44. Mr. CRISP incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding paragraphs as \nif fully set forth herein. \n45. Defendants,  under  color  of  state  law,  subjected  Mr.  CRISP  to  the  foregoing  acts  and \nomissions  without  due  process  of  law  and  in  violation  of  the  rights,  privileges  and \nimmunities secured by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, including, without limitation, deprivation of the \nfollowing constitutional rights:  \na.  freedom from unreasonable seizure, including the excessive use of force;   \nb.  freedom from interference with activity protected by the First Amendment;  \nc.  freedom from retaliatory use of force;  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 9 of 38\nd.  the right to equal protection under the laws; and \ne.  freedom from deprivation of liberty without due process of law. \n46. Defendants’ deprivation of Mr. CRISP’s constitutional rights resulted in the injuries and \ndamages set forth above. \nSECOND CLAIM \nFAILURE TO INTERVENE – FOURTH AMENDMENT – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n47. Mr. CRISP incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding paragraphs as \nif fully set forth herein. \n48. Members of the NYPD have an affirmative duty to assess the constitutionality of interactions \nbetween their fellow members of service and civilians and to intervene where they observe \nanother member of the Police Department  or  other law  enforcement  agency  employing \nunjustified and excessive force against a civilian. \n49. Several of the individual defendants, working as a unit, were present for the above-described \nincidents and witnessed other defendants, to wit, unlawfully use unlawful force against Mr. \nCRISP. \n50. For instance, INSPECTOR BOLOGNA’s use of force against Mr. CRISP was obviously \nexcessive  and  unjustified  under  the  circumstances,  yet  neither  OFFICER  DOE  41  nor \nOFFICER DOE 42 took any action or made any effort to intervene, halt or protect Mr. \nCRISP from being subjected to excessive force by INSPECTOR BOLOGNA. \n51. The DOE defendants’ violations of plaintiff’s constitutional rights by failing to intervene in \nBOLOGNA’s clearly unconstitutional use of force resulted in the injuries and damages set \nforth above. \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 10 of 38\nTHIRD CLAIM \nMONELL CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT CITY – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n52. Mr. CRISP incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding paragraphs as \nif fully set forth herein. \n53. All of the acts and omissions by the named and unnamed individual officer defendants \ndescribed above were carried out pursuant to overlapping policies and practices of the CITY \nwhich were in existence at the time of the conduct alleged herein and were engaged in with \nthe full knowledge, consent, and cooperation and under the supervisory authority of the \nCITY and its agency, the NYPD. \n54. Defendant CITY and the NYPD, by their policy-making agents, servants and employees, \nauthorized, sanctioned and/or ratified the individual defendants’ wrongful acts; and/or failed \nto prevent or stop those acts; and/or allowed or encouraged those acts to continue. \n55. The acts complained of were carried out by the aforementioned individual defendants in their \ncapacities as police officers and officials pursuant to customs, policies, usages, practices, \nprocedures and rules of the CITY and the NYPD, all under the supervision of ranking \nofficers of the NYPD. \n56. The aforementioned customs, practices, procedures and rules of the CITY and the NYPD \ninclude, but are not limited to, the following unconstitutional practices: (a) using excessive \nforce  on  persons  engaged  in  activity  protected  by  the  First  Amendment;  (b)  unlawful \ndetention of civilians engaged in activity protected by the First Amendment; (c) retaliating \nagainst  bystanders  and  witnesses  to  misconduct  by  other  police  officers;  (d)  failing  to \nsupervise, train, instruct and discipline police officers and encouraging their misconduct, \nincluding but not limited to defendant BOLOGNA; and (e) discouraging police officers from \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 11 of 38\nreporting the corrupt or unlawful acts of other police officers and retaliating against officers \nwho report police misconduct. \n57. The existence of the aforesaid unconstitutional customs and practices,  specifically with \nregard to the use of excessive force, unlawful detention, interference with protected \nFirst Amendment activity, retaliatory use of force, abuse of process and deprivation of \nliberty  without  due  process  of  law  against  individuals  apparently  associated  with \nOccupy Wall Street while engaged in protected First Amendment activity, are further \nevidenced,  inter  alia,  by  the  following  incidents  involving  NYPD  officers  and  OWS \nprotestors:3 \nSeptember 19, 2011 \na.  On September 19, 2011, an NYPD officer “reached over a curbside barricade” and \ngrabbed  an  OWS  protester.  The  protester  backed  away,  and  the  officer  “lunged \nforward, holding onto the man and toppling the metal barricade.” The officer then \nbrought the protester to the ground. The journalist stated that the incident happened \nafter the officer “ordered [the man] …to keep moving” and the man “spoke to the \ninspector for a moment, then lifted his hands and said that he was having difficulty \nmoving.”4 \nSeptember 20, 2011 \nb.  On September 20, 2011, police surrounded an OWS protester, who appeared to be \nmoving away from the officers, and threw him several feet off an elevated section of \ntarp onto the ground.5 \nc.  An NYPD officer grabbed a man (who was holding a camera and appeared to be \ndocumenting the arrest of another protester) by the arm and pulled him several feet \n                     \n3   All of the foregoing allegations are taken from the research compiled by The Global Justice Clinic at the \nNew York University School of Law and the Walter Leitner International Human Rights Clinic at the Leitner Center \nfor International Law and Justice at Fordham Law School in their publication entitled Suppressing Protest: Human \nRights Violations in the U.S. Response to Occupy Wall Street, published July 25, 2012, available online at \nhttp://www.documentcloud.org/documents/403969-suppressing-protest.html (last visited July 25, 2012). \n4   Colin Moynihan, Wall Street Protests Continue, With at Least 6 Arrested, N.Y.

An NYPD officer punched an OWS protester in the head, grabbed him by the neck \nand pulled him to the ground, without evident provocation.9 A journalist also reported \nthe incident and provided a segment of the above video, stating that the video “shows \nan officer in a white shirt throwing a right-handed punch at a young man wearing a T-\nshirt and glasses.”10 \nSeptember 24, 2011 \nf.  On September 24, 2011, a journalist stated that police threw him against a wall while \nhe was attempting to interview protesters.

Video appears to show that the \nprotester was attempting to document the arrest of another protester prior to being \nthrown. 14  A  second  video  shows  that  the  protester  was  kneeling  down  and \ndocumenting  an  arrest  when  an  officer  pushed  him  away.  The  protester  was \nattempting to get closer to the arrest when another officer pushed him backward even \nfurther, at which point a third officer threw him to the ground.  It is unclear whether \nthe protester initiated contact with the second pushing officer.15 The protester stated \nin an interview that he was filming “police brutality” when he was pushed and thrown \ndown, and that two officers hit him with batons which “burst open” his shin.16 \nj.  Video shows that two NYPD officers pulled an OWS protester to the ground.

Video shows that an officer pushed three protesters from the street to the sidewalk. \nThe third protester was already walking toward the sidewalk when he was pushed.18 \nl.  A journalist stated he witnessed “about 20 or 30 police officers tackle people and \nprod them roughly with police batons.”19 \nm.

On October 5, 2011, video shows that an NYPD officer struck an OWS protester with \na one-handed baton swing while holding onto  the protester’s arm. Several more \nofficers then ran in and threw the protester to the ground. It is unclear from the video \nwhether the protester was resisting the officer or whether there was another cause for \nthe baton use.21 \no.  Video  news  report  shows  that  an  NYPD  officer  took  at  least  nine  two-handed \noverarm swings at OWS protesters with his baton. The officer appeared to connect on \nat least three swings, although the video does not clearly show the swings landing. A \nreporter  stated  in  the  news  report  that  he  “took  a  hit  from  a  nightstick  in  the \nstomach.”22 \np.  Video shows that an NYPD officer took two one-handed swings with his baton at \nOWS protestors. It appears that the officer also swung the baton a third time, although \nthe officer’s arm and baton are out of the viewing frame. The video also appears to \nshow  that  an  officer  struck  the  man  recording  the  video  with  a  baton  while \nsimultaneously  yelling,  “back  up!”  The  officer  did  not  appear  to  give  the \nvideographer any time to comply before striking him.23 A second video appears to \nshow an officer hitting a protester with a one-handed baton swing. Although the \ncircumstances prior to the swing are unknown, the protester appeared to be seated on \nthe ground and did not appear to be threatening the officer. The actual contact is not \nclearly shown in the video.24 \nOctober 14, 2011 \nq.  On October 14, 2011, two journalists reported, “photographs from the scene showed \nan [NYPD] officer behind the barricade directing a stream of pepper spray at people \ntrying to shove their way past.”25 A reporter stated in a video news report that “Fox 5 \nphotographer Roy Isen got sprayed with mace” while covering the OWS protests.26 A \nsecond video shows an officer spraying pepper spray at least twice into a crowd of \nOWS protesters and at least one journalist.

Video shows that an NYPD officer sprayed multiple OWS protesters with pepper \nspray.

A journalist reported that an NYPD officer “grabbed an [OWS] protester wearing a \ngreen shirt. Then the [officer] punched the man, knocking him to the ground.”30 \nVideo shows that the officer punched a protester in the head. The protester was \nbacking away from the officer at the time of the punch and appeared to make a \ndownward swiping motion with his arm prior to the punch; it is unclear what the \nintent of this motion was.31 In an interview, the protester stated that he did not \nprovoke the officer. He also stated: “I was walking away from him, I was not walking \ntoward him . . . I was going away.  I didn’t say anything [to the officer].”32 \nt.

Video appears to show an officer striking a protester with three one-handed overhead \nbaton swings, although the protester is surrounded by officers and the contact is \nblocked from view.61 A journalist reported more general allegations of baton use by \npolice,  stating  that  on  November  17,  “officers  swung  batons  at  protesters  who \ncrowded the streets.” A photograph included in the journalist’s article shows a police \nofficer with his baton raised, as if about to strike into a crowd of protesters. It is \nunclear whether the report and the photo depict the same incident as the video or a \nseparate one.62 \npp. A reporter stated in a video interview that an officer struck her in the arm with a \nbaton  while  she  was  wearing  a  “clearly  marked”  press  pass.    The  reporter  was \nattempting to film police as they were pushing a barricade into protesters. She stated: \n“as I approached the crowd, a police officer yelled at me to get away and before I had \na chance to react, he swung his baton and hit me here in the shoulder. It wasn’t that \nintense, but it was just a shock.”63 \nqq. A reporter stated in a video interview that another reporter was “slammed against a \nwall and taken away in handcuffs.”64 \nrr.  Video appears to show that police pushed a woman onto the hood of a car. The \nwoman then fell to the ground and did not get up for several seconds. When she got \nup, the woman was holding a microphone; the video’s caption states that the woman \nis a “news reporter.”65 A news report provides a video of the same incident from \nanother angle and identifies the individual who was pushed as “Daily Caller reporter \nMichelle Fields.”66 \nss.

The \nperson filming the video can clearly be heard shouting “she’s a journalist!” several \ntimes. Video then shows the woman against a wall with flex-cuffs on her wrists. She \nsays to the person filming, “look at the cuffs, look how fucking tight they have these \ncuffs on me.” Video appears to show some discoloration in the woman’s hands. The \nvideo’s caption identifies the woman as a journalist and radio host and states that “she \nwas indiscriminately grabbed from the crowd while moving away from the chaos, as \ninstructed to do by NYPD… a police officer rush[ed] her from behind and body \nslam[med]  her  to  the  pavement.”67 A  radio  station  that  produces  a  show  titled \n“Occupy Wall Street Radio,” which “broadcasts the voice of the 99%,” lists the \nwoman as a host in charge of media and direct action.68 \ntt.  A  letter  from  the  New  York  Times  and  multiple  other  news  organizations  and \nadvocacy groups sent to the NYPD alleged that an officer grabbed and threw a \nphotographer to the ground, causing her to “hit[ ] her head on the pavement.” The \nphotographer had proper credentials that were “clearly visible.” The incident occurred \nafter two other officers gave the photographer conflicting instructions on where to \nwalk.69 \nuu. The letter also alleged  that  an officer pushed  a journalist,  wearing visible press \ncredentials, “with both his arms, forcing the reporter to fall backwards, landing on her \nright elbow.”  The officer then “proceeded to pick her up by her collar while yelling \n‘stop pretending.’ The reporter went to [a hospital] for treatment of her injuries.”70 \nvv. Video shows that an officer pulled a protester forward from a crowd; the reason for \npulling him is unclear. The officer, accompanied by another officer, then attempted to \npull the protester further forward by his shirt and arm, but the protester appeared to \nhold himself in place by holding onto a pole. A third officer approached the protester \nfrom behind and, without apparent warning, appeared to strike him twice with two \ndownward jabs of his baton. The baton-wielding officer then pushed the protester \nforward until he released his grip on the pole, at which point officers placed him \nunder arrest.71 Two other videos also show the third officer made a downward jabbing \n                     \n67   TheShamarReoprt, Journalist, Faith Laugier - Attacked, Assaulted and Arrested by NYPD: The Shamar \nReport, YOUTUBE (Nov. 17, 2011), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00CLssMbc-k (alleged grab and throw to \nground at 0:07). \n68   Occupy Wall Street Radio, WBAI: FREE SPEECH RADIO 99.5FM PACIFICA RADIO IN NEW YORK CITY, \nhttp://www.wbai.org/program.php?program=28 (last visited July 19, 2012) (“[o]n the show, a roundtable of hosts \nand producers will be your path to the action of the Occupy Movement day.

The  journalist  stated  that  “[a]fter  the  reporter  asked  the \ncaptain to stop, another officer threatened to yank away his police press pass.”87 Two \nother journalists for the New York Times reported that “one officer used two hands to \nrepeatedly shove backwards a credentialed news photographer who was preparing to \ndocument an arrest.” It is unclear whether this report pertains to the same incident as \nthe previous report.88 \nfff. Lawyers representing a legal observer stated that eight officers “charged toward [the \nlegal observer], forcing his upper body onto the hood of a parked car, where they \nroughly grabbed [his] arms and forced them high behind his back . . . .” Before the \nincident, the legal observer had been recording the names of arrestees as they were \nled to a police van. At the time when he was arrested, the legal observer was speaking \non his cell phone. The district attorney declined to prosecute the legal observer (who \nhad been charged with disorderly conduct).89 Video confirms the legal observer was \nspeaking on the phone when an officer approached him. The legal observer walked \ntoward the sidewalk, but the officer grabbed him and pushed him onto the hood of a \nparked car. Three other officers then came over and helped the officer cuff the legal \nobserver. At one point, eight officers surrounded the legal observer.90 \nggg.

The existence of the aforesaid unconstitutional customs and practices,  specifically  with \nregard to the failure to supervise, train, instruct and discipline police officers and \nencouraging their misconduct, are further evidenced, inter alia, by the following: \na.  The Report of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption and \nthe  Anti-Corruption  Procedures  of  the  Police  Department  (“Mollen  Commission \nReport”), dated July 7, 1994, states: \nIn the face of this problem [of corruption], the [NYPD] allowed its \nsystems for fighting corruption virtually to collapse.  It has become \nmore concerned about the bad publicity that corruption disclosures \ngenerate that the devastating consequences of corruption itself.  As a \nresult,  its  corruption  control  minimized,  ignored  and  at  times \nconcealed corruption rather than root it out.  Such an institutional \nreluctance  to  uncover  corruption  is  not  surprising.    No  institution \nwants its reputations tainted – especially a Department that needs the \npublic’s  confidence  and  partnership  to  be  effective.    A  weak  and \npoorly resources anti-corruption apparatus minimizes the likelihood of \nsuch taint, embarrassment and potential harm to careers.  Thus there is \na strong institutional incentive to allow corruption efforts to fray and \nlose priority – which is exactly what the Commission uncovered.  This \nreluctance manifested itself in every component of the Department’s \n                     \n112   Colin Moynihan, Protesters Arrested in Quebec Solidarity March, N.Y.

For at least the \npast  decade,  the  system  designed  to  protect  the  Department  from \ncorruption minimized the likelihood of uncovering it.116 \nb.  Accordingly,  in  1990,  the  Office  of  the  Special  Prosecutor,  which  investigated \ncharges of police corruption, was abolished. \nc.  In response to the Honorable Judge Weinstein’s ruling of November 25, 2009 in \nColon  v.  City  of  New  York,  09-CV-00008  (E.D.N.Y.),  in  which  he  noted  a \n“widespread… custom or policy by the city approving illegal conduct” such as lying \nunder  oath  and  false  swearing,  Commissioner  KELLY  acknowledged,  “When  it \nhappens, it’s not for personal gain. It’s more for convenience.”117 \nd.  Regarding defendant CITY’s tacit condonement and failure to supervise, discipline or \nprovide  remedial  training  when  officers  engage  in  excessive  force,  the  Civilian \nComplaint Review Board is a CITY agency, allegedly independent of the NYPD, that \nis responsible for investigating and issuing findings on complaints of police abuse and \nmisconduct.118   When  it  does,  however,  Police  Commissioner  KELLY  controls \nwhether the NYPD pursues the matter and he alone has the authority to impose \ndiscipline on the subject officer(s).  Since 2005, during KELLY’s tenure, only one-\nquarter  of  officers  whom  the  CCRB  found  engaged  in  misconduct  received \npunishment more severe than verbal “instructions.”  Moreover, the number of CCRB-\nsubstantiated cases that the NYPD has simply dropped (i.e., closed without action or \ndiscipline) has spiked from less than 4% each year between 2002 and 2006, to 35% in \n2007,  and  approximately  30%  in  2008.    Alarmingly,  the  NYPD  has  refused  to \nprosecute 40% of the cases sent to it by the CCRB in 2009.119  As a result, the \npercentage of cases where the CCRB found misconduct but where the subject officers \nwere given only verbal instructions or the matter was simply dropped by the NYPD \nrose to 66% in 2007.  Substantiated complaints of excessive force against civilians \naccounted for more than 10% of the cases that the NYPD dropped in 2007 and \naccount for more than 25% of cases dropped in 2008.120 \n                     \n116   Mollen Commission Report, pp. 2-3, available at http://www.parc.info/client_files/Special%20Reports/ \n4%20-%20Mollen%20Commission%20-%20NYPD.pdf. \n117   Oren Yaniv and John Marzulli, Kelly Shrugs Off Judge Who Slammed Cops, New York Daily News, \nDecember  2,  2009,  available  at  http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/12/02/2009-12-\n02_kelly_shrugs_off_judge_who_rips_lying_cops.html. \n118   In 2006, out of more than 10,000 allegations that were fully investigated, the CCRB substantiated only 594 \n(about 6%).  In 2007, out of more than 11,000 allegations that were fully investigated, the CCRB substantiated only \n507  (about  5%).    See,  CCRB  Jan.-Dec.  2007  Status  Report  at  p.  19,  available  at \nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/pdf/ccrbann2007_A.pdf.  Upon information and belief, the low rate of substantiated \ncomplaints is due in part to the above-noted de facto policy and/or well-settled and widespread custom and practice \nin the NYPD whereby officers refuse to report other officers’ misconduct or tell false and/or incomplete stories, \ninter alia, in sworn testimony and statements given to the CCRB, to cover-up civil rights violations perpetrated by \nthemselves or fellow officers, supervisors and/or subordinates. \n119   Christine Hauser, Few Results for Reports of Police Misconduct, New York Times, October 5, 2009, at \nA19.   \n120   Daily News, Editorial: City Leaders Must Get Serious About Policing the Police, August 20, 2008. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 30 of 38\n59.

The existence of the aforesaid unconstitutional customs and practices,  specifically with \nregard to the practice or custom of discouraging police officers from reporting the \ncorrupt or unlawful practices of other police officers and of retaliating against officers \nwho report misconduct, are further evidenced, inter alia, by the following: \n                                                                  \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 31 of 38\na.  Former New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has been quoted as \nacknowledging  that,  in  the  NYPD,  there  is  a  “code  of  silence,”  or  a  “code  of \nprotection” that exists among officers and that is followed carefully; \nb.  In 1985,  former NYPD Commissioner Benjamin  Ward, testifying before a State \nSenate  Committee,  acknowledged  the  existence  of  the  “code  of  silence”  in  the \nNYPD; \nc.  Former NYPD Commissioner Robert Daly wrote in 1991 that the “blue wall of \nsolidarity  with  its  macho  mores  and  prejudices,  its  cover-ups  and  silence,  is \nreinforced every day in every way.” \n61. The  existence  of  aforesaid  unconstitutional  customs  and  policies  may  be  inferred  from \nrepeated occurrences of similar wrongful conduct, as documented in the following civil \nrights actions filed against the CITY: \na.  Berg v. Kelly, 12-CV-3391, (TPG) (S.D.N.Y.) (NYPD officers detain approximately \n100 “Occupy” demonstrators for two hours against their will on November 30, 2011 \ninside a pen built of interlocking metal barricades and then release them without \ncharges);  \n \nb.  Garcia v. Bloomberg, 11-CV-6957 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y.) (NYPD arrest 700 “Occupy” \ndemonstrators on the Brooklyn Bridge on October 1, 2011, for the simple act of \nwalking on the bridge in what appeared to participants to be an action sanctioned by \npolice present at the time); \n \nc.  Treffs v. City of New York, 12-CV-3030 (HB) (S.D.N.Y.) (legal observer arrested \nwhile observing Occupy Wall Street march on January 1, 2012, without probable \ncause and false complaint sworn out against him); and \n \nd.  Lambert  v.  City  of  New  York,  153046-2011  (Sup.  Ct.,  N.Y.  Co.)  (officers  use \nexcessive force against OWS protestor by affixing plastic handcuffs so tightly that it \ncaused nerve damage, despite her repeated requests to the officers that the cuffs be \nloosened but were not). \n \n62. The existence of the above-described unlawful  de facto policies and/or well-settled and \nwidespread customs and practices is known to, encouraged and/or condoned by supervisory \nand policy-making officer and officials of the NYPD and the CITY, including, without \nlimitation, Commissioner RAYMOND KELLY and CHIEF ESPOSITO. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 32 of 38\n63. The actions of the individual police defendants resulted from and were taken pursuant to the \nabove-mentioned de facto policies and/or well-settled and widespread customs and practices \nof the CITY, which are implemented by members of the NYPD, of engaging in systematic \nand ubiquitous perjury, both oral and written, to cover-up federal law violations committed \nagainst  civilians  by  either  themselves  or  their  fellow  officers,  supervisors  and/or \nsubordinates.  They do so with the knowledge and approval of their supervisors, commanders \nand Commissioner KELLY who all:  (i) tacitly accept  and encourage a code of silence \nwherein  police  officers  refuse  to  report  other  officers’  misconduct  or  tell  false  and/or \nincomplete stories, inter alia, in sworn testimony, official reports, in statements to the CCRB \nand the Internal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”), and in public statements designed to cover for \nand/or falsely exonerate accused police officers; and (ii) encourage and, in the absence of \nvideo  evidence  blatantly  exposing  the  officers’  perjury,  fail  to  discipline  officers  for \n“testilying”  and/or  fabricating  false  evidence  to  initiate  and  continue  the  malicious \nprosecution of civilians in order to cover-up civil rights violations perpetrated by themselves \nof fellow offices, supervisors and/or subordinates against those civilians. \n64. All of the foregoing acts by defendants deprived the plaintiff of federally protected rights, to \nwit the rights listed in paragraph “45” supra. \n65. Defendant CITY knew or should have known that the acts alleged herein would deprive Mr. \nCRISP of her rights, in violation of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n66. Defendant  CITY  is  directly  liable  and  responsible  for  the  acts  of  the  individual  police \ndefendants because it repeatedly and knowingly failed to properly supervise, train, instruct, \nand discipline them and because it repeatedly and knowingly failed to enforce the rules and \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 33 of 38\nregulation of the CITY and NYPD, and to require compliance with the Constitution and laws \nof the United States. \n67. Despite  knowledge  of  such  unlawful  de  facto  policies,  practices  and/or  customs,  these \nsupervisory and policy-making officers and officials of the NYPD and the CITY, including \nCHIEF  ESPOSITO,  have  not  taken  steps  to  terminate  these  policies,  practices  and/or \ncustoms, do not discipline individuals who engage in such polices, practices and/or customs, \nor otherwise properly train police officers with regard to the constitutional and statutory \nlimits  on  the  exercise  of  their  authority,  and  instead  sanction  and  ratify  these  policies, \npractices and/or customs through their active encouragement of, deliberate indifference to \nand/or reckless disregard of the effect of said policies, practices and/or customs upon the \nconstitutional rights of persons in the City of New York. \n68. The aforementioned CITY policies, practices and/or customs of failing to supervise, train, \ninstruct and discipline police officers and encouraging their misconduct are evidenced by the \npolice  misconduct  detailed  herein. Specifically,  pursuant  to  the  aforementioned  CITY \npolicies, practices and/or customs, INSPECTOR BOLOGNA felt empowered to exercise \nunreasonable  and  wholly  unprovoked  force  against  Mr.  CRISP.  Pursuant  to  the \naforementioned CITY policies, practices and/or customs, defendants failed to intervene in or \nreport other defendants’ violation of plaintiff’s rights.        \n69. Mr. CRISP’s injuries were a direct and proximate result of the defendant CITY and the \nNYPD’s wrongful de facto policies and/or well-settled and widespread customs and practices \nand of the knowing and repeated failure of the defendant CITY and the NYPD to properly \nsupervise, train and discipline their police officers. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cv-05842-RWS   Document 1   Filed 07/31/12   Page 34 of 38\n70. The actions of the individual police defendants resulted from and were taken pursuant to the \nfollowing de facto policies and/or well-settled and widespread customs and practices of the \nCITY, which implemented by agents or employees of the NYPD, of employing wholly \nunprovoked and excessive force. \n71. Defendants, collectively and individually, while acting under color of state law, acquiesced \nin a pattern of unconstitutional conduct by subordinate police officers and were directly \nresponsible for the violation of Mr. CRISP’s constitutional rights. \nFOURTH CLAIM \nRESPONDEAT SUPERIOR LIABILITY OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK \nFOR STATE LAW VIOLATIONS \n \n72.
