Weinstein, Senior United States District Judge: \nI.  Introduction \nThe Chancellor of the City School District of the City of New York moves to terminate \nthe remedial order imposed by this court in 1974 requiring defendants to desegregate Mark \nTwain Intermediate Gifted and Talented School (\"Mark Twain\") in Brooklyn, New York.  See \nHart v. Cmty Sch. Bd., 383 F. Supp. 699 (E.D.N.Y. 1974) (\"Hart I\"); see also Defendant's \nMotion dated Feb. 12,2008, Docket Entry No. 456. \nAnjan Rau and Kanchan Katpadi move to intervene.  See Motion to Intervene dated Jan. \n14, 2008, Hart Docket Entry No. 45\\.  Proposed intervenors are also plaintiffs in 08-CV- 210 \n(\"Rau\").  They seek relief similar to that requested by the Chancellor in Hart.  The intervenors \nare American citizens of Asian Indian descent.  They have three children.  One applied for \nadmission to Mark Twain for the 2007-2008 school year and was denied entry.  Another child \nwill seek admission to Mark Twain for the 2008-2009 school year. \nHaving long ago graduated, the plaintiffs do not have the same direct interest they \npossessed at the time they began the Hart litigation.  Nonetheless, they contend that they still \nretain standing and an interest in the litigation.  Plaintiffs consent to the request of the Chancellor \nI \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 522\nwith one important caveat: they would have the court issue a narrow order to save it from being \nmisinterpreted in a manner foreclosing the utilization of race, among other factors, in any future \nassignment of students to Mark Twain. \nThe court has received communications from parents and interested members of the \ncommunity opposing the motions.  A number of parents and others spoke at a hearing on the \nmotions.  Some expressed concern that Mark Twain will lose its status as a school for the \ntalented and gifted.  Others do not want the school to lose the racial balance achieved pursuant to \nthe 1974 remedial order.  Still others objected to the reduction of the number oflocal children \nadmitted as the school increasingly drew students from allover the City. \nThis litigation is a third of a century old.  It has long been designated on the court's \ndocket as \"closed.\" In 1990, the Mark Twain Junior High School Parents' Association sought an \norder requiring the Chancellor to provide contract busing for out-of-district students.  That \nrequest was denied because segregation had been eliminated and there was no need for further \ncontrol by the court.  See Order dated Aug. IS, 1990, Docket Entry No. 456. \nSince 1974 Mark Twain has operated in a remarkably effective manner.  Illustrative are \nthe achievements of its students; recently at the Polytechnic University's Future City competition \nthey were awarded the \"Safest City\" and \"Best Use of Nanotechnology\" awards. \nDefendants have complied with the terms of the court's 1974 remedial order.  The \ndesegregation of Mark Twain has been fully achieved.  The court has no further jurisdiction. \nThe motion to intervene in the Hart case by Anjan Rau and Kanchan Katpadi is denied as moot. \nII.  History of the Hart Litigation \nA.  Trial Proceedings \nHart was the first New York City school desegregation case to reach a federal court. \n2 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 523\nHart, 383 F. Supp. at 706.  It was a class action on behalf of children attending Coney Island's \nMark Twain Junior High School, J.H.S. 239.  The defendants included the Community School \nBoard of Brookiyn, New York, School District Number 21 (\"CSB 21\") and the Chancellor of the \nBoard of Education of the City of New York. \nPlaintiffs alleged that the defendants were creating, and maintaining, a segregated Mark \nTwain.  They prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief, including a direction to the defendants \n\"to formulate and implement forthwith a comprehensive plan which will eliminate, with \ndeliberate speed, the racially segregated and underutilized nature of Mark Twain Junior High \nSchool and which will provide for and assure equal educational opportunities for the plaintiffs \nand the members of their class.\"  See Complaint at 12, Docket Entry No. I. \nCSB 21 and its members interposed a general denial.  Primarily they defended on the \nground that if segregation existed, it was due to housing patterns fostered and maintained by the \ncity, state, and federal authorities who were impleaded as third-party defendants. \nA bench trial was conducted over many months commencing on January 2, 1973.  On \nDecember 19, 1973, the court announced its decision.  It found that the School Board and \nChancellor were liable for conducting a segregated school in violation of the Constitution; and it \nrequired a plan, effective in September 1974, which would provide that the school population of \nMark Twain not deviate more than ten percent from the average ratio of the minority to the white \npopulation in District 21.  A written opinion was issued on January 28,1974.  See Hart I, 383 F. \nSupp.699. \nThe parties were ordered to submit a plan in conformity with the decision by March 1, \n1974, to be put in operation in September, 1974.  They submitted plans on March 1, 1974.  After \nhearings, beginning on April 2, 1974, the court appointed the late Professor Curtis J. Berger as \n3 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 524\nSpecial Master, and found that \"plans to deal comprehensively with conditions that have figured \nin the segregation of Mark Twain cannot be executed by September of 1974.  Accordingly, the \ndesegregation of Mark Twain is postponed to September 1975.\" Id. at 762. \nB.  Appeal to the Court ofA  ppeals for the Second Circuit \nPlaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, seeking a \nreinstatement of the original September, 1974 date.  The appeal was dismissed on the ground that \nthe district court had not issued an injunction from which an appeal could be taken.  See Hart v. \nCmty Sch. Bd., 497 F.2d 1027 (2d Cir. 1974) (\"Hart II\"). \nC.  Judgment of this Court \nAfter the Special Master reported in July 1974, the court had before it three basic plans \nfor desegregation of Mark Twain: (I) a plan proposed by the School Board; (2) a plan, quite \nsimilar, but more detailed, by the Special Master; and (3) plans proposed by Professor Dan W. \nDodson, plaintiff's expert on educational desegregation. \nThe court entered a final judgment on July 26, 1974 in the form of a memorandum \nopinion and order.  Hart v. Cmty Sch. Bd., 383 F. Supp. 769 (E.D.N.Y. 1974) (\"Hart III\").  It \nrequired that the plan tendered by the School Board be executed with conditions added by the \ncourt.  The decree called for: (I) redrawing the feeding patterns of the middle schools so that the \nincoming grade of each intermediate and junior high school, and 7th and 8th grades of K-8 \nschools, would reflect approximately 70% Caucasian and 30% \"minority\" populations-which \nwas the approximate ratio of the school population in the district's middle schools; (2) graduate \nthe 8th and 9th grades of Mark Twain; (3) transfer Mark Twain's present 7th grade, and zone the \ngraduating pupils ofP.S. 188 and P.S. 238 (predominantly minority schools) to middle schools in \nthe district other than Mark Twain; and (4) establish at Mark Twain a District School for gifted \n4 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 525\nand talented children-a \"magnet school\".  Id. at 771. \nThe plan required that no new special or accelerated programs for the academically gifted \nknown as \"SP\" or \"SPE\" programs be organized in any other school in the district.  Eliminating \nthose programs provided a major incentive for parents to send their children to Mark Twain, \nwhich would be the only special program in the district for gifted and talented students.  Id. at \n774.  Guidance on what would constitute sufficient desegregation was provided: \nThe  magnet  school  plan  will  be  deemed  to  have  failed  if there  are  not  in \nattendance at Mark Twain-in the ratio of approximately 70-30, white to minority \nstudents-at a minimum at the beginning of the school year in September 1975, \n350 students; in September 1976, 750 students; and in September 1977, 1050 \nstudents.  Pursuant  to  the  Master's  recommendations,  the  plan  will  also  be \nconsidered to have failed if at least 400 children have not expressed an intention \nto emoll in the program at Mark Twain by March  15,  1975;  800 children by \nMarch  15,  1976; and  1100 children by March 15,  1977, in order to allow for \nnatural attrition and in order to  provide adequate time for  an alternative plan \nshould failure be highly probable. \nId. at 774. \nDeveloped was a \"plan B,\" in case the magnet school concept should not be viable: \nIn order to provide for an alternative plan should the  'Magnet School' concept \nfail,  by January 1,  1975, the Chancellor, in cooperation with the School Board \nshall provide, in reserve, detailed proposals for new zoning and busing schedules \nbased on 'Model II' of the proposal of Dr. Dodson.  The full reserve plan shall be \nkept up-to-date by necessary modifications based upon changes in population. \nModifications shall be prepared by January 1,1976 and by January 1,1977 for the \nnext succeeding school year. \nD.  Appeal on Merits \nAn appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  See Hart v. Cmty \nSch. Bd., 512 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1975) (\"Hart IV\").  The Court of Appeals described the various \npositions taken by each party on appeal: \na) The Chancellor of the City Board of Education filed a brief in support of the \n5 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 526\nCommunity School Board plan.  It does not address itself to the order \"mooting\" \nor dismissing the third-party action.  b) The [C]ity of New York urges that the \nDistrict Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order HDA and the other \nhousing defendants to follow a specific housing plan.  c) HUD filed a brief urging \nthat the District Court properly adjudged the third-party complaint as moot. d) \nThe State agencies similarly urge affirmance upon the cross-appeal by the CSB \n21.  e) Intervention was allowed by the District Court on June 14, 1974 of certain \npersons, as a separate class, consisting of parents with children in Mark Twain or \nabout to go there who reside on Coney Island sites designated for urban renewal. \nThese intervenors have filed a brief urging affirmance on the cross-appeal of the \nschool board. \nId. at 43 n. 8.  It summarized what each party was seeking on appeal: \n(1) The plaintiffs appeal from the July 26, 1974 judgment confined to the District \nCourt's approval of the plan to make Mark Twain a school for gifted and talented \nchildren, on the ground that the plan is constitutionally impermissible, while at the \nsame time seeking approval by this Court of the Dodson plan (Model II), and \nasking that the District Court's altemative plan become operative now. \n(2) CSB 21 appeals from the order of February 21,1974, which purported to moot \nits third-party complaint. \n(3)  CSB  21  also  cross-appeals  from  the  decision  holding  it  liable  for  the \nsegregated condition of Mark Twain. \nId. at 43 (emphasis in original). \nThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with this court's finding that: (1) \nMark Twain was segregated as a matter of constitutional law, due at least in part to state action, \nid. at 45-52; (2) postponement of the desegregation plan to the beginning of the next school year, \nSeptember 1, 1975, was appropriate and did not violate the Supreme Court's \"all deliberate \nspeed\" directive, id. at 53; (3) the magnet plan did not impose an unfair burden on minority \nstudents, id.; and (4) the approval of the School Board's plan was within this court's equitable \npowers, id. at 55. \nE.  Compliance with the 1974 Remedial Order \nThe Chancellor, an original defendant in the Hart litigation, is now the head of the New \n6 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 527\nYork City Department of Education.  With the abolition of Community School Boards in 2003, \nthe Department of Education became responsible for enrollment.  According to the Chancellor, \nthe 1974 remedial order has remained in effect, and has continued to be implemented in good \nfaith. \nFollowing the 1974 order, Mark Twain turned into a highly successful school.  Some \n1,200 students now attend in grades 6-8.  Although only 400 to 450 students are admitted to each \nentry class, approximately 2,000 applicants ranked Mark Twain as the first choice on their \napplication for the 2007-2008 school year.  The school offers talent specialization in eleven \nareas: arts, athletics, computers/mathematics, creative writing, dance, science, vocal, theater, \nvisual media, and instrumental music in winds and strings.  Students learn in a rigorous, \ninterdisciplinary environment that brings diverse students with a range of talents together in the \nclassroom. \nThe results of this program are impressive: Mark Twain students consistently earn high \nscores on state exams, and are admitted to the City's specialized high schools in large numbers. \nSo successful was Mark Twain in attracting students early on that the School Board approached \nthe court in 1976 to reinstitute accelerated programs in the other schools.  According to a letter \nfrom the attorney for the School Board, there were so many applications to Mark Twain that a \nsignificant number of students were unable to attend, leaving many gifted and talented students \nfrom District 21 without an accelerated studies program. \nThe School Board proposed that acceptance into the accelerated programs at other \nschools remain linked to Mark Twain admissions to ensure that the court-ordered percentages \nwould be met at Mark Twain.  This recommendation has been followed. \nAfter the initial implementation period ended in 1978, the parties returned to court over \n7 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 528\ncompliance issues only once.  In 1990, the Mark Twain Junior High School Parents' Association \nsought an order requiring the Chancellor to provide contract busing for out-of-district students \nadmitted to Mark Twain.  In denying that request, the court stated that Mark Twain had been \nconstitutionally administered and that \"[ilt is undesirable for the federal courts to continue \nsupervision of state educational institutions once the constitutional violations that gave rise to the \noriginal action have been eliminated - as they have in the case of Mark Twain.\"  See Order \ndated Aug. 15, 1990 at 3.  On October 27, 2000, the court noted that it \"doubts that continuing \njurisdiction is still justified.\"  See Order dated Oct. 27, 2000, Docket Entry No. 446. \nF.  Demographics ofD  istrict 21 \nAt the time of the Hart decision in 1974, District 21 was \"overwhelmingly white.\"  Hart \n1,383 F. Supp. at 741.  By 2000, the White population had declined to under 70%; among the \nDistrict's school residents, White non-Hispanics comprised 55.7% of residents aged 5-14, a 15% \ndecline from 1980.  The White percentage further declined to 40.7% in 2007. \nIII.  Law \nA.  Defendants' and Intervenors' Arguments \nRelying on the Supreme Court's recent decision in Parents Involved in Cmtv Schs. v. \nSeattle Sch. Dist., 127 S. Ct. 2738 (2007) (\"Seattle\"), the Chancellor and the proposed \nintervenors argue that vestiges of discrimination have been eliminated to the extent practicable. \nThey ask the court to declare that Mark Twain: (l) is now effectively desegregated and that \"all \nvestiges\" of any past de jure or de facto segregation have been eliminated; and (2) has achieved a \nconstitutionally acceptable \"unitary\" status.  The proposed intervenors, but not the Chancellor, \nclaim that the race-based quotas that are used in part by defendants to determine admission to \nMark Twain are unconstitutional.  The proposed intervenors ask the court to order the defendants \n8 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 529\nto admit Nikita Rau into Mark Twain. \nB.  Passage of Time \nThe Supreme Court has explained that judicial supervision of local schools as a result of \npast discrimination is not intended to \"operate in perpetuity.\"  Bd .0fEduc. of Oklahoma City v. \nDowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248 (1991).  It declared: \nFrom the very first, federal supervision of local school systems was intended as a \ntemporary  measure  to  remedy  past  discrimination.  Brown  considered  the \ncomplexities arising from the transition to a system of public education freed of \nracial discrimination in holding that the implementation of desegregation was to \nproceed with all deliberate speed .... \n[L]ocal control over the education of children allows citizens to participate in \ndecisionmaking,  and  allows  innovation  so  that  school  programs  can  fit  local \nneeds.  The legal justification for displacement of local authority by an injunctive \ndecree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the Constitution by the \nlocal authorities.  Dissolving a desegregation decree after the local authorities \nhave  operated in compliance with it for  a reasonable period of time properly \nrecognizes that necessary concern for the important values of local control of \npublic school systems dictates that a federal  court's regulatory control of such \nsystems  not extend  beyond  the  time  required  to  remedy  the  effects  of past \nintentional discrimination. \nId. at 247-48 (quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis in original). \nIn determining whether a desegregation decree should be dissolved, the Court has \ndirected inquiry into \"whether the [School] Board had complied in good faith with the \ndesegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination had \nbeen eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 492 (1992) (plurality) \n(quoting Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50).  Good faith compliance should be monitored only for a \nreasonable period oftime.  Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248.  Compliance is characterized as an \nassessment of the \"unitariness\" of the school system, although the Supreme Court has \nemphasized that \"the term 'unitary' is not a precise concept.\"  Freem!ID, 503 U.S. at 487 (citation \n9 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 10 of 16 PageID #: 530\nomitted).  It would be a \"mistake to treat words such as 'dual' and 'unitary' as if they were \nactually found in the Constitution.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 245. \nA vestige of segregation is a condition or practice which is fairly traceable to, and \nproximately caused by, the original constitutional violation.  United States v. Yonkers Bd. of \nEduc., 123 F. Supp. 2d 694,701 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (a vestige is a \"policy or practice which is \ntraceable to the prior de jure system of segregation and which continues to have discriminatory \neffects.\").  Passage oftime since the original violation makes it less likely that the necessary \ncausal link will be found to exist between the original constitutional violation and any alleged \nracial imbalances that remain.  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 496 (\"As the de jure violation becomes \nmore remote in time and these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a \ncurrent racial imbalance in a school district is a vestige of the prior de jure system.\"). \nDefendants' implementation of the remedial order at Mark Twain and the achievement of \na racial mix at Mark Twain and other District 21 middle schools over the last thirty years \ndemonstrate substantial good-faith compliance over a long period of time.  The original \nconstitutional violation in this case was the racial segregation of Mark Twain.  Hart 1,383 F. \nSupp. at 713-14.  No vestiges remain.  Mark Twain and District 21 today do not in any way \nreflect the unconstitutional actions and situations found in 1974. \nC.  Effect of Seattle \nThe intervenors' reliance on Seattle, 127 S. Ct. 2738 for the proposition that the 1974 \ndecree does not now accord with the law is not well-founded in the face of the plurality Seattle \nopinion, and Brown v. Bd. of Ed. of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). \nIn Seattle, Chief Justice Roberts' opinion was joined by Justices Scalia, Thomas (who \nfiled his own concurrence) and Alito.  Justice Kennedy filed a separate opinion concurring with \n10 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 11 of 16 PageID #: 531\nthe Roberts' opinion on narrow grounds.  Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion joined in by \nJustices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg; Justice Stevens filed a separate dissenting opinion. \nThe critical section III-B of Chief Justice Roberts's opinion, disfavoring school \ndesegregation orders was joined by three other Justices.  It is summarized as follows: \nAccepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify the \nimposition of racial proportionality throughout American society, contrary to our \nrepeated recognition that at the heart of the  Constitution's guarantee of equal \nprotection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as \nindividuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national \nclass.  Allowing racial balancing as a compelling end in itself would effectively \nassure that race will always be relevant in American life, and that the ultimate \ngoal of eliminating entirely from  governmental decisionmaking such irrelevant \nfactors as  a human being's race will never be achieved.  An interest linked to \nnothing other than proportional representation of various races  would  support \nindefinite use of racial classifications, employed first to obtain the appropriate \nmixture of racial views and then to ensure that the program continues to reflect \nthat mixture. \nSeattle, 127 S. Ct. at 2757-58 (internal quotation marks, footnotes, ellipses and brackets \nomitted). \nJustice Breyer's dissenting opinion for four, recognizing the continuing need for some \ndesegregation work at the local level, is encapsulated as follows: \nThese cases consider the longstanding efforts of two local school boards to \nintegrate their public schools. The school board plans before us resemble many \nothers adopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary schools throughout \nthe Nation.  All of those plans represent local efforts to bring about the kind of \nracially  integrated  education  that  Brown  v.  Board  of Education  long  ago \npromised-efforts  that  this  Court  has  repeatedly  required,  permitted,  and \nencouraged local  authorities to  undertake.  This Court has  recognized  that the \npublic interests at stake in such cases are \"compelling.\" We have approved of \n\"narrowly tailored\" plans that are no less race-conscious than the plans before us. \nAnd we have understood that the Constitution permits local communities to adopt \ndesegregation plans even where it does not require them to do so. \nThe  plurality  .  .  .  distorts  precedent,  it  misapplies  the  relevant \nconstitutional principles, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by state \nand  local  governments  to  deal  effectively  with  the  growing  resegregation  of \npublic schools, it threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of \nII \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 12 of 16 PageID #: 532\nrace-related litigation, and it undermines Brown's promise of integrated primary \nand secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality. \nThis cannot be justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause. \nId. at 2800-01 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). \nThe deciding opinion of Justice Kennedy, concurring generally with the Chief Justice's, \nallows for the use of race as one admission factor among others.  It in effect becomes the Court's \nruling.  In sununarizing his view, Justice Kennedy acknowledged the need in some instances to \ntake race into account in school assignments: \nThis  Nation  has  a  moral  and  ethical  obligation  to  fulfill  its  historic \ncommitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for \nall of its children.  A compelling interest exists in avoiding racial isolation, an \ninterest that a school district, in its discretion and expertise, may choose to pursue. \nLikewise, a district may consider it a compelling interest to  achieve  a diverse \nstudent  population.  Race  may  be  one  component  of that diversity,  but other \ndemographic factors, plus special talents and needs, should also be considered. \nWhat the government is not permitted to do, absent a showing of necessity not \nmade here, is to classify every student on the basis of race and to assign each of \nthem to schools based on that classification.  Crude measures of this sort threaten \nto  reduce  children to  racial chits valued and traded according to one  school's \nsupply and another's demand. \nThat statement, to be sure, invites this response: A sense of stigma may \nalready become the fate  of those separated out by circumstances beyond their \nimmediate control. But to this the replication must be: Even so, measures other \nthan differential  treatment based on racial typing  of individuals first  must be \nexhausted. \nThe decision today should not prevent school districts from continuing the \nimportant  work  of bringing  together  students  of different  racial,  ethnic,  and \neconomic  backgrounds.  Due  to  a  variety  of  factors-some  influenced  by \ngovernment,  some  not-neighborhoods in our communities do  not reflect the \ndiversity of our Nation as a whole.  Those entrusted with directing our public \nschools can bring to bear the creativity of experts, parents, administrators, and \nother concerned citizens to find a way to achieve the compelling interests they \nface  without resorting  to  widespread  governmental  allocation of benefits  and \nburdens on the basis of racial classifications. \nId. at 2797. \n12 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 13 of 16 PageID #: 533\n• \nThe Seattle decision must be read in the light of the principle set forth by the Supreme \nCourt in Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), giving great weight to a swing opinion \nsuch as Justice Kennedy's.  The Court has reaffirmed its holding in Marks: \nIn that case, we explained that \"[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no \nsingle rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding \nof the  Court may be  viewed  as  that position  taken  by  those  Members  who \nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\" \nGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306,325 (2003) (quoting Marks, 430 U.S. at 193). \nIn applying Marks, the Grutter Court endorsed the view of Justice Powell in his \nconcurring opinion in Regents ofUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) \"that student body \ndiversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.\" \nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 325.  Accordingly, it is the view of Justice Kennedy in Seattle, which \nrepresents the applicable approach under Marks, and the guiding standard on the use of race as \none of a number of appropriate admissions factors. \nThe same considerations that permit race as one factor among many that may be \nconsidered in college and graduate schools under Grutter and Bakke should be applied to grade \nschools where characteristics for future success or failure are imprinted on students.  As Chief \nJustice Warren stated in Brown: \n[I]n finding that a segregated law school for Negroes could not provide them \nequal educational opportunities, this Court relied in large part on those qualities \nwhich are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a \nlaw school.  In McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, (339 U.S. 637), the Court, \nin requiring that a Negro admitted to a white graduate school be treated like all \nother students, again resorted to intangible considerations: his ability to study, to \nengage in discussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to \nlearn his profession. Such considerations apply with added force to children in \ngrade  and  high  schools.  To  separate  them  from  others  of similar  age  and \nqualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to \ntheir status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way \nunlikely ever to be undone.  The effect of this separation on their educational \n13 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 14 of 16 PageID #: 534\n-• \nopportunities was well stated by a finding in the Kansas case by a court which \nnevertheless felt compelled to rule against the Negro plaintiffs: \nSegregation of white and colored children in public schools \nhas a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is \ngreater when  it has  the  sanction of the  law;  for  the  policy  of \nseparating  the  races  is  usually  interpreted  as  denoting  the \ninferiority of the negro  group.  A sense of inferiority affects the \nmotivation of a child to  learn.  Segregation with the sanction of \nlaw, therefore, has a tendency to retard the educational and mental \ndevelopment of Negro children and to deprive them of some of the \nbenefits they would receive in a racially integrated school system. \nBrown, 347 U.S. at 494-95 (emphasis added; parenthesis and footnote omitted). \nIV.  Motion to Intervene \nThe motion to intervene must be denied for two reasons.  First, the contention that the \nlaw has changed making the 1974 remedial order invalid is unfounded.  If the facts were the \nsame today as they were in 1974, the same decree would issue because the plaintiffs proved both \nde facto and de jure segregation.  Brown still rules.  Deliberate segregation in grade schools is \nstill illegal. \nSecond, the case is closed and has been closed for a considerable time.  The docket sheet \nso indicates.  Any challenge based on alleged discriminatory practices with respect to Mark \nTwain requires an independent action. \nV.  Certificate of Closure \nThe Supreme Court has indicated that defendants who have complied with a \ndesegregation decree are entitled to a certificate of closure.  See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248.  It is \nissued forthwith: The defendants have complied with the 1974 remedial order.  Mark Twain has \nbeen desegregated.  The court has no jurisdiction over the case. \nVI.  Parents' Continuing Concern \n14 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 15 of 16 PageID #: 535\nThe court has received many letters from parents whose children currently attend Mark \nTwain or have attended in the past.  Students from this wonderful school---created by so many \ndevoted teachers, students, parents, and government officials-have contributed to making it a \nsuccess.  In their letters, these parents express concern about possible destruction of this stellar \nmodel of urban education. \nBased on the record, the court finds that the City and the Department of Education are \nacting in good faith and that they intend to continue the school along its present excellent lines. \nTo reassure concerned parents, the court requests a letter from the Chancellor indicating that: \n1.  Students currently attending satisfactorily will be permitted to graduate on \nschedule. \n2.  Mark Twain will continue to be conducted as a superior magnet school. \n3.  Mark Twain will continue to be conducted as a desegregated school. \nVII.  Conclusion \nThe defendants have complied with the 1974 remedial order.  Mark Twain has been \ndesegregated.  The court has no jurisdiction.  The case is closed. \nThe motion to intervene is denied. \nVIII.  Acknowledgements \nRecently the court visited the school and its environs.  While the school building is \nphysically sound, the metal gates at the school's entrance on Neptune Avenue are rusting.  Paint \nmight be useful to improve the morale of those entering the school.  The sign designating Mark \nTwain as a magnet school also needs to be restored and freshened up.  In general, the building \nstock in the surrounding area, the nearby parks and public facilities, the Coney Island Boardwalk \n15 \n\nCase 1:72-cv-01041-JBW   Document 475   Filed 02/28/08   Page 16 of 16 PageID #: 536\nand beach and much improved public transportation facilities provide a fine area for this \nextraordinary school and its students and staff. \nThe court thanks the concerned parents for voicing their concerns and the parties for \nsubmitting excellent briefs.  It notes the positive contribution made to the desegregation of Mark \nTwain by the attorneys in this case: James Meyerson, Hyman Bravin, Edward Boyd, Christine A. \nFlynn, Robert Hammer, Jeanne Hollingsworth, and by the experts: Professor Dan W. Dodson \nand Professor Nathan Glazer. \nSpecial Master Curtis J. Berger's extraordinary work in helping to solve the Mark Twain \nproblem was particularly notable.  His death has deprived the legal world of a scholar who has \nhelped provide innovative and workable methods of reducing segregation in urban environments. \nSee [Professor Curtis J.

Examination of the transcript \n  of the hearing of March 5, 1974 indicates that, despite some language along these lines, all that the judge really did \nwas to assert, quite properly in our view, that since his decision of January 28 was not then appealable, the notice of \nappeal did not strip him of jurisdiction to continue his work on the remedy. \n \n4  After referring to the Taylor decision, 9 Moore, Federal Practice P110.20 (1) at 235 (Ward ed. 1973), says that ‘the \n  weight of authority would appear to be the other way.’ The two cases cited for this statement do not bear it out. In \nBoard of Public Instruction of Duval County, Florida v. Braxton, 326 F.2d 616, 619 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 924, \n84 S.Ct. 1223, 12 L.Ed.2d 216 (1964), Chief Judge Tuttle correctly distinguished Taylor on the basis that then District \nJudge Kaufman’s initial decision in Taylor had not contained any words of restraint, whereas in Braxton the district \ncourt had actually enjoined the doing of certain acts and then merely deferred the effective date of the injunction \n4 \n \n\n \n \nHart v. Community School Bd. of Brooklyn, New York School..., 497 F.2d 1027 (1974)   \n \n \nwhile directing ‘that a plan be submitted that would provide for carrying out the (injunctive) paragraphs that were \nto be later effectuated.’ Id. In Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 375 F.2d 158 (10 Cir.), cert. denied, \n387 U.S. 931, 87 S.Ct. 2054, 18 L.Ed.2d 993 (1967), after the board had filed two unsatisfactory plans, the court \nappointed a panel of experts to devise a new plan and ultimately ordered the board to submit a plan substantially \nidentical with that recommended by the experts; this seems to have been simply a polite gesture, no different in \nsubstance from the court’s directing the board to comply with the report of the experts as modified. The point of \nTaylor was that there had not yet been any plan which the court was prepared to order. Bradley v. Milliken, 468 F.2d \n902 (6 Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 844, 93 S.Ct. 45, 34 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972), cited in the cumulative supplement of \nMoore for use in 1974, is in accord with Taylor, although arising in a somewhat different posture (order to submit \ndesegregation plan issued after mere ‘pretrial conference’). Compare Bradley v. Milliken, 484 F.2d 215 (6 Cir.), cert. \ngranted, 414 U.S. 1038, 94 S.Ct. 538, 38 L.Ed.2d 329 (1973) (appeal granted under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) from orders \nfinding segregation and outlining extremely broad geographic ambit of type of plan to be sought, which orders were \nconcededly ‘interlocutory’). In any event Taylor is the law of this circuit and we have no disposition to modify it in \ncases where, as here, the judge’s initial decision simply found liability and directed the defendants and others to \nassist the court in the expeditious framing of a decree. \n \n5  Elaborating on this, Judge Weinstein said: \n \nIt is not only the question of buildings, it is the question of the readiness of the community, both parents and the \nchildren; it is the question of whether the children will go into institutions where they will be received properly and \nnot with hostility; it is a question of whether the educational program will benefit all the children of all races and \nethnic backgrounds, or whether we will have an order which will give the appearance of accomplishing something \nwhen it does not accomplish anything. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n ",

FACTS \nA. The Area and its Environs \nThe New York Metropolitan area consists of New York \nCity, the counties on Long Island, the area to the north on \nthe mainland, and the cities and counties of northern New \nJersey, with a total population of over ten million. The \nlargest concentration of black and Hispanic populations \nare in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Harlem \n \nin Manhattan and in the South Bronx.

Milliken, 484 F.2d 215, 251 (6 Cir.1973), \nwhich was later reversed by the Supreme Court, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069, at page 1078 (1974). \nSince the third party defendants have not pressed an appeal, we find it unnecessary to consider the correctness of \nthe court’s ruling. \n \n3  In deciding on the appointment of a Special Master, the District Court acknowledged that “it is apparent that a \n13 \n \n\n \n \nHart v. Community School Bd. of Ed., N.Y. School Dist. No. 21, 512 F.2d 37 (1975)   \n \n \n  complete and integrated proposal covering education, housing and related matters has not yet been formulated.” \n383 F.Supp. at 758. \n \n4  Junior high schools are comprised of grades 7 through 9; intermediate schools of grades 6 through 8 or 9; and K-8 \n  schools of kindergarten through grade 8. \n \n5  The text of the School Board resolution relating to this phase of the plan follows verbatim: \n \n“III. Establish at Mark Twain a District School for Gifted and Talented Children \n“A) Entrance by application and selection only. \n“B) Admit only pupils who are graduating from elementary schools and would normally attend junior high \nschool or intermediate schools in District 21. Students in the 6th grade of K-8 schools shall be eligible. Those \nstudents accepted for the program leaving 6th grade to go into 7th grade at Mark Twain. Those students \naccepted for the program leaving 5th grade to go into 6th grade at Mark Twain. \n“C) Original group to be about 333 pupils or more. \n“D) Approximate ratio of 70% Caucasian, 30% ”Minority“ to be adhered to at Mark Twain School for Gifted and \nTalented Children. \n“E) No new SP or SPE programs will be organized henceforth in any school in the district. (Existing programs will \ncontinue to graduation). \n“F) Parents will have the right to have the gifted and talented child returned to his zoned school immediately \nfor any reason.” \n \n6  The Model II plan focuses on the use of busing to equalize utilization of all the middle schools in the district and to \n  bring the ratio of white to minority students within each school into general alignment with the ratio within the \ndistrict as a whole. Under this plan, the burden of being bused is allocated more evenly between white and minority \nstudents than under the School Board’s plan, although minority students would still be bused more than whites. See \n383 F.Supp. at 772. \n \n7  The Court also ordered all parties, including the third-party defendants, to submit monthly reports beginning on \n  September 30, 1974, “indicating what progress has been made to date and what problems, if any, have arisen.” \n \n8  The following positions were taken by the parties to this action on appeal: a) The Chancellor of the City Board of \n  Education filed a brief in support of the Community School Board plan. It does not address itself to the order \n“mooting” or dismissing the third-party action. b) The city of New York urges that the District Court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in refusing to order HDA and the other housing defendants to follow a specific housing plan. c) HUD filed \na brief urging that the District Court properly adjudged the third-party complaint as moot. d) The State agencies \n14 \n \n\n \n \nHart v. Community School Bd. of Ed., N.Y. School Dist. No. 21, 512 F.2d 37 (1975)   \n \n \nsimilarly urge affirmance upon the cross-appeal by the CSB 21. e) Intervention was allowed by the District Court on \nJune 14, 1974 of certain persons, as a separate class, consisting of parents with children in Mark Twain or about to \ngo there who reside on Coney Island sites designated for urban renewal. These intervenors have filed a brief urging \naffirmance on the cross-appeal of the school board. \n \n9  Indeed, District 21 permits “open enrollment” in the intermediate and junior high schools of the district by students \n  who live outside the district. These are largely black and Puerto Rican students from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section. \nBy being allowed to cross district lines, they are able to find a school more racially balanced than if they were \ncompelled to remain in Bedford-Stuyvesant. By October, 1972, such students comprised more than 10% of the total \nenrollment. \n \n10  We have been instructed that in evaluating racial discrimination we are to group Negroes and Hispanos together as \n  contrasted with whites. Keyes v. School District No. 1, supra, 413 U.S. at 195-98, 93 S.Ct. 2686. \n \n11  Tracking is grouping students into classes within a school on the basis of their achievement level. It has been used in \n  newly desegregated schools to perpetuate racial separation. See United States Commission on Civil Rights, Racial \nIsolation in the Public Schools 161-62 (1967), as cited in the opinion below, 383 F.Supp. at 740. \n \n12  See footnote 9, supra. \n \n \n13  See also United States v. Scotland Neck City Board of Education, 407 U.S. 484, 92 S.Ct. 2214, 33 L.Ed.2d 75 (1972). \n \n \n14  In Spencer v. Kugler, 404 U.S. 1027, 92 S.Ct. 707, 30 L.Ed.2d 723 (1972), the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of \n  a three-judge statutory court, which, following Swann, see note 22 infra, had used the de facto-de jure distinction in \ndeclining to correct segregation in public schools where there was no action of state authorities. 326 F.Supp. 1235, \n1242 (D.N.J.1971). But cf. Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School District, 467 F.2d 142, 147-49 (5 Cir. 1972), \ncert. denied, 413 U.S. 922, 93 S.Ct. 3052, 37 L.Ed.2d 1044, rehearing denied, 414 U.S. 881, 94 S.Ct. 31, 38 L.Ed.2d \n129 (1973). \n \n15  As Justice Frankfurter commented in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 343-44, 81 S.Ct. 125, 128, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 \n  (1960): “Particularly in dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an \ninterpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the \nconcrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling \nfacts.” \n \n16  An early distinction between the effect of the Board’s action and the Board’s subjective purpose was made by Mr. \n15 \n \n\n \n \nHart v. Community School Bd. of Ed., N.Y. School Dist. No. 21, 512 F.2d 37 (1975)   \n \n \n  Justice Stewart (then Circuit Judge) in Clemons v. Board of Education of Hillsboro, 228 F.2d 853, 859 (6 Cir.), cert. \ndenied, 350 U.S. 1006, 76 S.Ct. 651, 100 L.Ed. 868 (1956). \n \n17  We used the “effect” test in Pride v. Community School Board, supra, 482 F.2d at 265, where we held, following \n  Wright, that “a plaintiff alleging unlawful discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment is not required to prove that a discriminatory motive preceded the unlawful effect.” (Timbers, J.). \n \n18  In Soria, the Court of Appeals said: “The function of this Court is not to determine whether there is sufficient \n  evidence from which the requisite intent and cause of segregated schools can be deduced when there are no \nexplicit findings on these questions and the parties raise contradictory inferences from the facts.” 488 F.2d at 588. \n \n19  Before September, 1970, the local school board shared much of its responsibility for structuring the education \n  institutions of District 21 with the Central Board of the Board of Education. After that date, the Board of Education \nwas decentralized, and the Community School Board assumed major responsibility for the district. \n \n20  We are not concerned with Section 256 of the “Education Amendments of 1974” P.L. 93-380 (Aug. 21, 1974) which \n  provides that “after June 30, 1974 no court of the United States shall order the implementation of any plan to \nremedy a finding of de jure segregation which involves the transportation of students, unless the court first finds \nthat all alternative remedies are inadequate.” The only alternative plan offered to the Court was the Dodson Model \nII plan, which demands more busing than the remedy adopted by the Court. \nWe note that Congress made section 256 retroactive to June 30, 1974, before the date of its enactment, August \n21, 1974. Since no plan not involving busing was presented to the District Court, we express no opinion on \nwhether the Congressional provision would otherwise have found the District Court, which entered its order on \nJuly 26, 1974 before the enactment. \n \n21  In Higgins, the Court of Appeals held that one-way busing of black inner-city students to peripheral areas in order to \n  mitigate the effects of “white flight” from the public school system did not unconstitutionally place a greater burden \non black children than on white children. 508 F.2d at 793-795 (6 Cir. 1974). We have no such issue here. The busing \nrequired is by no means onesided. \n \n22  In Swann, the Supreme Court also found inapplicable in the context of de jure segregation a Congressional statute \n  which seemed to bar reassignment of students or busing to achieve racial balance. Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, 42 U.S.C. s 2000c et seq., authorizes the Attorney General to sue for desegregation of schools. Section \n2000c(b), defining “desegregation,” reads in part, “ ‘desegregation’ shall not mean the assignment of students to \npublic schools in order to overcome racial imbalance.” Section 2000c-6 states that nothing in the Title shall \nempower a federal official or court to issue any order requiring “transportation of pupils” to achieve racial balance \n“or otherwise enlarge the existing power of the court....” The Court construed the statutory language and the \nlegislative history to indicate that Congress wished only to ensure that Title IV could not be “read as creating a right \n16 \n \n\n \n \nHart v. Community School Bd. of Ed., N.Y. School Dist. No. 21, 512 F.2d 37 (1975)   \n \n \nof action under the Fourteenth Amendment in the situation of so-called ‘de jure segregation.’ ” The traditional \nequitable powers of a federal court to correct violations of the Fourteenth Amendment by state authorities \nremained intact. Swann, supra, 402 U.S. at 16-18, 91 S.Ct. at 1277. \n \n23  The District Court ordered the Chancellor and the School Board to develop by January 1, 1975 detailed proposals for \n  rezoning and busing schedules based on Dodson’s “Model II” plan in case the magnet school plan failed. The \nproposals were to be updated as population shifted, and modified on January 1st of 1976 and of 1977. Thus, if the \nschool authorities at any time fail to meet the schedule specified for implementation of the magnet school plan, see \nsupra, the Model II plan may be put into effect. \n \n24  The District Judge himself finally acknowledged, after the Special Master had reported, that “the decretal tool is \n  poorly designed for restructuring an entire community.” 383 F.Supp. at 775. \n \n25  In Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974), in commenting on an inter-district \n  remedy too large in scope, the Supreme Court predicted that “the District Court will become, first, a de facto \n‘legislative authority’ to resolve these complex questions, and then the ‘school superintendent’ for the entire area.” \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n17 \n ",
