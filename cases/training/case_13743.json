PETERS,\nChairman; ROBERT B. WRIGHT,\nJR., ROY HENDRICKS, MRS.\nRALPH HOBBS, JOHN A. RiCHARDSON,\nDAVID F. RICE, HENRY STEWART,\nJAMES DEWAR, CLIFF KIMSEY, JR.,\nand WILLIAM L. PRESTON, Members;\nand JACK P. NIX, State Superintendent\nof Schools\nORDER OF THE COURT\nHaving concluded by separate orders entered on\nDecember 15, 1969, that we unquestionably have jurisdiction,\nand that all necessary parties are before us, we proceed to\nconsider the duty of the Defendant and the individual school\ndistricts as recently illuminated by Carter v. West Feliciana\nParish School Brd.,(cid:9) U. S.(cid:9) (No. 9I4, December 13,\n1969); Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education,(cid:9) U. S.\n(No. 632, October 29, 1969); and Singleton v. Jackson\nMunicipal Separate School District, ____ F.2d(cid:9) (5th Cir.,\nNo. 26285, December 1, 1969).\nk\nIt is now abundantly clear, to all save those who\nadamantly refuse to see or hear, that the supreme law of these\nUnited States provides that dual school systems must be completely\nabolished. United States v. Montgomery County Brd. of Ed., 23\nL. Ed.2d 213 (1969). In this case, it is the task of this court\nto determine how the application of this law affects the State\nBoard of Education and the schools of this State as a whole.\nWhile the mandate of the law is plain, what is not clear is just\nwhat is required of the local school systems. The lack of\n\nadministrators, school patrons, and citizens generally. The\ncourt firmly believes that whatever is required ought to be.\nrequired as uniformly as possible. In this respect, the higher\ncourts have not yet issued definitive rules as to just what steps\nare legally required of each local school district.\nThe question is not the legality of any HEW guidelines\nnor:-the right of any school district to federal funds. Nor does\nthe point of dispute here require the court to mold some\naccommodation between the two. The aim and ultimate requirement\nof_.-the.law clearly exists in the decisions of the Supreme Court,\nthe Fifth Circuit and other courts, and the results are demanded\nthere, without regard to any federal legislation or federal\nappropriation whatsoever.\nIt is obvious to this court that the task cannot be\naccomplished bymass litigation, school district by school\ndistrict, and even schoolhouse by schoolhouse, through the separat\nschool districts and schools of this state -- unless all other\nlegal business is to cease. The federal district courts have\nneither the numbers, the time, the capacity, nor the expertise to\nhear such litigation. Moreover, the prospect of courts acting as\nadministrators or \"super school boards\" is contrary to the\nI\nconcept of the judge's traditional role, and is anathema to our\nsystem of local public education. Nor are the courts unmindful\nof: the tremendous effect of housing patters- on school desegrega-\ntion,.particularly in urban areas. Even in enlightened school\ndistricts, the problem is compounded by racial population shifts\nand the concomitant resegregation of normal school attendance\nzones. In all candor, the eventual solution of the housing\nproblem may well solve the school problem, but such solution is,\nimminent.\nat this time, not \nMeanwhile, it is incumbent upon this court to provide\ndirection to all concerned. Because of the enormity of the\na\n\nproblems and the complexity of the details, the court adopts a\nplan to test results alone. This method appears to be the only\npractical approach open, and perhaps affords an opportunity to\ncreate some order in an emotional and confusing situation.\nThe ultimate question presented by this suit is: \"When\nis,a school district considered in compliance with law.\" Stated\n1 another way, when has a school district deemed to  have abolished\na. dual school system and when has it not? The court subscribes\nto:the idea that the question is best answered by judicial\ndefinition of an integrated, non-dual school district, or \"unitary\nsystem. Defining terminology is necessary, important and the\n1. beginning point for all such investigation. In this connection\nI and for purposes of the order which follows, the court adopts\nthe .following definitions:\nL \nSchool district. School district shall mean any com-\nbination of schools administered by a county, municipal,\nindependent or area school board and a central administrative\noffice, and considered an integral unit for the allocation of\nstate funds and administrative purposes by the State School Board\nand the State Superintendent of Schools.1\nMinority race. Minority race shall mean the race,\nblack or white, which constitutes less than half of the total\npupil enrollment, in any school district for any one regular\nschbol year, but shall not apply to any summer school or adult or\nspecial education courses afforded by the various school districts,\nMinority quotient. Minority quotient shall mean that\npercentage representing the proportion which the number of student!\n` 1As presently constituted, there are -192 school districts or\nsystems in Georgia: the 159 county school systems and the 33 so-\ncalled \"Independent\" city school systems in the larger incorporate(\nmunicipalities of the state. However, consolidation ofsuch city\nsystems into existing county school systems have proven, in most\ncases, to be advantageous economically and educationally.\nConsequently, the definition is prospective to include any future\nconsolidations.\n'A. .\n\nof a minority race bears to the entire pupil enrollment in any\nschool district.2\nFaculty and Staff. Faculty and staff shall mean all\nprofessional and certificated employees of a school district\nemployed in an administrative or teaching capacity, whether paid\nby state  local funds, but shall not include custodial,\nor \nmaintenance or lunch room employees, or school bus drivers of\nsuch district.\nFaculty quotient. Faculty quotient shall mean that\npercentage representing the proportion which the number of\nfaculty and staff members of one race, less than half, bears to\nthe total number of faculty and staff, as defined above, in any\nschool district.3\nSchool Activities. School activities shall mean any\nendeavor, other than academic, participated in by pupils or\nfaculty and staff of any school district in a student or faculty\ncapacity such as athletics, music, or any competition, meeting, or\nperformance involving one or more schools.\nEquality of standards. Equality of standards shall\nmean a uniform system of pay, employment, and selection for\nfaculty and a uniform system of curriculum offerings, testing,\nand assignment of pupils within a school district.\n1(cid:9) Integrated school facility. An integrated school•\nfacility shall mean any schoolhouse or school complex administered\nby a single school principal and containing one or more school\ngrades, and in which:\n2For example, if a particular district has 2000 pupils of which\n60% are white and l0% are black, the minority quotient for such\ndistrict is 40.\n3For example, if the same district has 75% white faculty and staff\nmembers, and 253 black, the faculty quotient for such district is\n25.\n4.\n\n(1) the ratio of minority to majority pupil population\nIs within 50% to 150 of the minority quotient,4 and each grade\ntherein has assigned to it pupils of both races enrolled in such\ngrade within the school;5 and\n(2) the ratio of-faculty and staff assigned to such\nfacility on a full-time basis is 50% to 150% of the faculty\nquotient; 6 system-wide personnel are to be counted in such ratio\nproportionately to the number of schools served; and\n(3) there exists \"equality of standards,\" and\n(4) \"school activities\" are open to all pupils and\nfaculty and staff, regardless of race.\nIntegrated school district. The object of this order\nis to eliminate the dual school system. - To that end and subject\nto the court's approval in instances where the following does not\nproduce such result, each system involved shall provide for an\nintegrated school district for the school year 1970-71 and each\nschool year thereafter in which:\n(1) in each and every school facility,\n(a) the ratio of faculty and staff assigned to\nsuch facility on a full-time basis is 50% to 150% of the faculty\nquotient; system-wide personnel are to be counted In such ratio\nproportionately to the number of schools served; and\n(b) there exists \"equality of standards,\" and\n(c) \"school activities\" are open to all pupils\nandkfaculty and staff, regardless of race;.and\n(2) three fourths of all pupils in a minority race are\nenrolled in integrated school facilities as hereinbefore defined\n4For example, an integrated school facility where the minority\nquotient is 40 must have 502 to 150% of the quotient enrolled. In\na school facility of 400, this would mean a spread of 80 to 240\npupils of the minority race.\nSFor example, if there are fourgrades within a bona fide attendance\n3 \narea, and fortuitously only  of such grades have students of the\nminority race, such facility shall not thereby lose its qualifica-\ntion as an integrated facility, provided the other standards are\nmet.\n61n the same example, if there are 20 faculty members and the facult\nquotient is t0, this would mean a spread of 4 to 12 faculty memberr-\nnP 4kn MI,i I4 r rono\n\nfor the school year 1970-1971; 7 and each school year thereafter;\nand\n(3) No geographic attendance zone shall be drawn on\nthe basis of race so as to provide that children enrolled in the\nsame grade of one race within such attendance zone attend a\ncertain school and children of another race within such attendancel\nzone attend another school, even though such pupils comprise less\n25% of the total  district.\nthan  enrollment in the \n(4) a bona fide plan exists permitting a student\nattending a school in which his race is in the majority to choose\nto attend another school, where space is available under the\n372\nstandards enunciated in United States v. Jefferson County, \n836 \nF.2d  (5th Cir. 1966) and where his race is in the minority.\nProvided a plan achieves the result of a unitary school\nsystem no particular plan is required; thus, it should be noted\nthat the abandonment of school buildings is neither required nor\nprohibited; the rezoning of school attendance areas is neither\nrequired nor prohibited; \"Freedom of Choice\" is neither required\npupils \nnor prohibited; the bussing8 of  is neither required nor\nprohibited; the \"pairing\" of schools is neither required nor\nprohibited; neighborhood schools are neither required nor\nprohibited. All of these are but means at the disposal of every\nlocal school board to achieve the necessary results. What is\ndesirable for one community may not be feasible for another, and\nfs \nit  the privilege of every local board to exercise wise\ndiscretion to find the means best suited to the needs of its own\npupils and patrons.\nHow best to monitor the progress? The state school\nboard and state superintendent's office are vested with vast\npowers to Inspect, to standardize, to recommend, and, moreover,\n7Such figures compare favorably with unified school systems\nthroughout the country.\n8Strangely enough, the 33 \"independent\" city school systems\nreceive no funds for transportation of pupils and consequently\nprovide no bussing whatsoever.\n\nLI\nto check the reliability of reported figures of each district.\nThe personnel are already available there, the information Is\nalready available there, and, above all, the educational expertise\nis : constantly available there. What might be complicated and\nobtuse to the court, is simple and mundane to such professional\neducators. By the simple process of withholding state funds9\nto  not in \nunder-the orders of this court  all districts  compliance\nwith \nthese findings, uniformity can soon be achieved.\nit Is hoped that each of the systems involved through\nthe state board will proceed to effectuate the results herein-\nafter directed as soon as possible, and that thereby, our people\nand teachers can more rapidly devote all of their energies to the\njob of educating our children, from which some have long departed\nin:. some quest for legalisms.\nTo that end, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DIRECTED until\nthe further order of the Court:\nA. That with respect to the school districts herein-\nafter enumerated the State Board of Education acting through the\nState Superintendent of Schools and the State Department of\nEducation is hereby temporarily enjoined from the payment of any\npublic funds except on the following conditions:\n(1) The school districts described in Appendix\nA attached hereto are deemed to be initially\nk ^(cid:9) affected by this Order; all other.districts\nwithin the State having already come under\nseparate Court orders or having satisfied the\nadministrative requirements of a unitary system.\n(2) The State Board is hereby directed to\nobtain desegregation plans from each of such\naffected districts, complying with the standards\n9Whieh account for a large percentage of all funds for public\neducation in the state.\n7..\n\nhereinbefore prescribed by the Court, on or\n,l\niV `i 10\nbefore March 1, 1-969-.\t Each plan shall show\nthe anticipated enrollment, by race and grade,\nfor each school.\n(3) The State Board is hereby directed to\nprocess and review all of such plans with the\naid and assistance of representatives of the\nAtlanta Regional Office of the Division of\nEqual Educational Opportunities of the Office\nof Education, Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare, and on or before April 1, 1970,\nto report their respective findings to the\nCourt, specifically stating whether the plan\nof each school district complies with the\nstandards established above by the Court.\n(4) Where any plan submitted on or before\nApril 1, 1970, does not comply with the above\nstandards, the State Board is further directed\nto endeavor to secure such compliance on or\nI\t\nbefore May 1, 1970.\n(5) Each of such plans shall be fully\nimplemented and effectuated no later than\n.September 1, 1970. To that end, the local\n.units will submit a report similar to the\none attached to this order as Appendix B to\nthe State Department of Education, with copies\nto the Atlanta Regional Office, Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare, on or before\nOctober 10, 1970, and October 10 each year\nl\n°ln this connection, we are not mindful of the dates stated in\nSingleton, et al v. Jackson Municipal School District, et al,\nsupra, and subsequent orders. However, that litigation involved\nschool districts already before the courts for as long as four\nyears, while this is the first hearing affecting any district\ninvolved here. Further, the resources of all parties concerned\ncould not possibly comply with any shorter time schedule. Lastly,\neven if the parties could the manpower of this court could not\neffectuate relief in the 60 districts simultaneously as would\notherwise be recuired.\n\nthereafter, showing the enrollment by race\nand grade of each school operated by the\n1970,\n'local unit. On or before November 1, \nand on or before November 1 of each succeeding\nyear, said office shall report to the Court\nits findings as to compliance by each affected\ndistrict for such action as may be deemed\nappropriate under the circumstances.\nB. No funds shall be paid by the State to any affected\n1970, \ndistrict which has not submitted a plan by March 1,  as\nprovided in A (2) above, or whose plan is not found by May 1,\n1970,  (4)\nto be in compliance by the Board as prescribed in A \nabove; or which plan is found by the Court not to have been\nimplemented on September 1, 1970, as directed by the Court's\nOrders thereafter.\nC. The districts Involved having been ordered to\ndesegregate and to establish a unitary public school system,\nsuch districts as are not now eligible for federal funds may now\nreapply for the same and, upon proper application, such funds\nshall be restored forthwith.\nD. Interested parties are directed to the opinion\nin the case of. Singleton, et al v.

PRESTON, Members;\nand JACK P. NIX, State Superintendent\nof Schools\nORDER OF THE COURT\nHaving concluded by separate orders entered on\nDecember 15, 1969, that we unquestionably have jurisdiction,\nand that all necessary parties are before us, we proceed to\nconsider the duty of the Defendant and the individual school\ndistricts as recently illuminated by Carter v. West Feliciana\nParish School Brd.,(cid:9) U. S.(cid:9) (No. 9I4, December 13,\n1969); Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education,(cid:9) U. S.\n(No. 632, October 29, 1969); and Singleton v. Jackson\nMunicipal Separate School District, ____ F.2d(cid:9) (5th Cir.,\nNo. 26285, December 1, 1969).\nk\nIt is now abundantly clear, to all save those who\nadamantly refuse to see or hear, that the supreme law of these\nUnited States provides that dual school systems must be completely\nabolished. United States v. Montgomery County Brd. of Ed., 23\nL. Ed.2d 213 (1969). In this case, it is the task of this court\nto determine how the application of this law affects the State\nBoard of Education and the schools of this State as a whole.\nWhile the mandate of the law is plain, what is not clear is just\nwhat is required of the local school systems. The lack of\n\nadministrators, school patrons, and citizens generally. The\ncourt firmly believes that whatever is required ought to be.\nrequired as uniformly as possible. In this respect, the higher\ncourts have not yet issued definitive rules as to just what steps\nare legally required of each local school district.\nThe question is not the legality of any HEW guidelines\nnor:-the right of any school district to federal funds. Nor does\nthe point of dispute here require the court to mold some\naccommodation between the two. The aim and ultimate requirement\nof_.-the.law clearly exists in the decisions of the Supreme Court,\nthe Fifth Circuit and other courts, and the results are demanded\nthere, without regard to any federal legislation or federal\nappropriation whatsoever.\nIt is obvious to this court that the task cannot be\naccomplished bymass litigation, school district by school\ndistrict, and even schoolhouse by schoolhouse, through the separat\nschool districts and schools of this state -- unless all other\nlegal business is to cease. The federal district courts have\nneither the numbers, the time, the capacity, nor the expertise to\nhear such litigation. Moreover, the prospect of courts acting as\nadministrators or \"super school boards\" is contrary to the\nI\nconcept of the judge's traditional role, and is anathema to our\nsystem of local public education. Nor are the courts unmindful\nof: the tremendous effect of housing patters- on school desegrega-\ntion,.particularly in urban areas. Even in enlightened school\ndistricts, the problem is compounded by racial population shifts\nand the concomitant resegregation of normal school attendance\nzones. In all candor, the eventual solution of the housing\nproblem may well solve the school problem, but such solution is,\nimminent.\nat this time, not \nMeanwhile, it is incumbent upon this court to provide\ndirection to all concerned. Because of the enormity of the\na\n\nproblems and the complexity of the details, the court adopts a\nplan to test results alone. This method appears to be the only\npractical approach open, and perhaps affords an opportunity to\ncreate some order in an emotional and confusing situation.\nThe ultimate question presented by this suit is: \"When\nis,a school district considered in compliance with law.\" Stated\n1 another way, when has a school district deemed to  have abolished\na. dual school system and when has it not? The court subscribes\nto:the idea that the question is best answered by judicial\ndefinition of an integrated, non-dual school district, or \"unitary\nsystem. Defining terminology is necessary, important and the\n1. beginning point for all such investigation. In this connection\nI and for purposes of the order which follows, the court adopts\nthe .following definitions:\nL \nSchool district. School district shall mean any com-\nbination of schools administered by a county, municipal,\nindependent or area school board and a central administrative\noffice, and considered an integral unit for the allocation of\nstate funds and administrative purposes by the State School Board\nand the State Superintendent of Schools.1\nMinority race. Minority race shall mean the race,\nblack or white, which constitutes less than half of the total\npupil enrollment, in any school district for any one regular\nschbol year, but shall not apply to any summer school or adult or\nspecial education courses afforded by the various school districts,\nMinority quotient. Minority quotient shall mean that\npercentage representing the proportion which the number of student!\n` 1As presently constituted, there are -192 school districts or\nsystems in Georgia: the 159 county school systems and the 33 so-\ncalled \"Independent\" city school systems in the larger incorporate(\nmunicipalities of the state. However, consolidation ofsuch city\nsystems into existing county school systems have proven, in most\ncases, to be advantageous economically and educationally.\nConsequently, the definition is prospective to include any future\nconsolidations.\n'A. .\n\nof a minority race bears to the entire pupil enrollment in any\nschool district.2\nFaculty and Staff. Faculty and staff shall mean all\nprofessional and certificated employees of a school district\nemployed in an administrative or teaching capacity, whether paid\nby state  local funds, but shall not include custodial,\nor \nmaintenance or lunch room employees, or school bus drivers of\nsuch district.\nFaculty quotient. Faculty quotient shall mean that\npercentage representing the proportion which the number of\nfaculty and staff members of one race, less than half, bears to\nthe total number of faculty and staff, as defined above, in any\nschool district.3\nSchool Activities. School activities shall mean any\nendeavor, other than academic, participated in by pupils or\nfaculty and staff of any school district in a student or faculty\ncapacity such as athletics, music, or any competition, meeting, or\nperformance involving one or more schools.\nEquality of standards. Equality of standards shall\nmean a uniform system of pay, employment, and selection for\nfaculty and a uniform system of curriculum offerings, testing,\nand assignment of pupils within a school district.\n1(cid:9) Integrated school facility. An integrated school•\nfacility shall mean any schoolhouse or school complex administered\nby a single school principal and containing one or more school\ngrades, and in which:\n2For example, if a particular district has 2000 pupils of which\n60% are white and l0% are black, the minority quotient for such\ndistrict is 40.\n3For example, if the same district has 75% white faculty and staff\nmembers, and 253 black, the faculty quotient for such district is\n25.\n4.\n\n(1) the ratio of minority to majority pupil population\nIs within 50% to 150 of the minority quotient,4 and each grade\ntherein has assigned to it pupils of both races enrolled in such\ngrade within the school;5 and\n(2) the ratio of-faculty and staff assigned to such\nfacility on a full-time basis is 50% to 150% of the faculty\nquotient; 6 system-wide personnel are to be counted in such ratio\nproportionately to the number of schools served; and\n(3) there exists \"equality of standards,\" and\n(4) \"school activities\" are open to all pupils and\nfaculty and staff, regardless of race.\nIntegrated school district. The object of this order\nis to eliminate the dual school system. - To that end and subject\nto the court's approval in instances where the following does not\nproduce such result, each system involved shall provide for an\nintegrated school district for the school year 1970-71 and each\nschool year thereafter in which:\n(1) in each and every school facility,\n(a) the ratio of faculty and staff assigned to\nsuch facility on a full-time basis is 50% to 150% of the faculty\nquotient; system-wide personnel are to be counted In such ratio\nproportionately to the number of schools served; and\n(b) there exists \"equality of standards,\" and\n(c) \"school activities\" are open to all pupils\nandkfaculty and staff, regardless of race;.and\n(2) three fourths of all pupils in a minority race are\nenrolled in integrated school facilities as hereinbefore defined\n4For example, an integrated school facility where the minority\nquotient is 40 must have 502 to 150% of the quotient enrolled. In\na school facility of 400, this would mean a spread of 80 to 240\npupils of the minority race.\nSFor example, if there are fourgrades within a bona fide attendance\n3 \narea, and fortuitously only  of such grades have students of the\nminority race, such facility shall not thereby lose its qualifica-\ntion as an integrated facility, provided the other standards are\nmet.\n61n the same example, if there are 20 faculty members and the facult\nquotient is t0, this would mean a spread of 4 to 12 faculty memberr-\nnP 4kn MI,i I4 r rono\n\nfor the school year 1970-1971; 7 and each school year thereafter;\nand\n(3) No geographic attendance zone shall be drawn on\nthe basis of race so as to provide that children enrolled in the\nsame grade of one race within such attendance zone attend a\ncertain school and children of another race within such attendancel\nzone attend another school, even though such pupils comprise less\n25% of the total  district.\nthan  enrollment in the \n(4) a bona fide plan exists permitting a student\nattending a school in which his race is in the majority to choose\nto attend another school, where space is available under the\n372\nstandards enunciated in United States v. Jefferson County, \n836 \nF.2d  (5th Cir. 1966) and where his race is in the minority.\nProvided a plan achieves the result of a unitary school\nsystem no particular plan is required; thus, it should be noted\nthat the abandonment of school buildings is neither required nor\nprohibited; the rezoning of school attendance areas is neither\nrequired nor prohibited; \"Freedom of Choice\" is neither required\npupils \nnor prohibited; the bussing8 of  is neither required nor\nprohibited; the \"pairing\" of schools is neither required nor\nprohibited; neighborhood schools are neither required nor\nprohibited. All of these are but means at the disposal of every\nlocal school board to achieve the necessary results. What is\ndesirable for one community may not be feasible for another, and\nfs \nit  the privilege of every local board to exercise wise\ndiscretion to find the means best suited to the needs of its own\npupils and patrons.\nHow best to monitor the progress? The state school\nboard and state superintendent's office are vested with vast\npowers to Inspect, to standardize, to recommend, and, moreover,\n7Such figures compare favorably with unified school systems\nthroughout the country.\n8Strangely enough, the 33 \"independent\" city school systems\nreceive no funds for transportation of pupils and consequently\nprovide no bussing whatsoever.\n\nLI\nto check the reliability of reported figures of each district.\nThe personnel are already available there, the information Is\nalready available there, and, above all, the educational expertise\nis : constantly available there. What might be complicated and\nobtuse to the court, is simple and mundane to such professional\neducators. By the simple process of withholding state funds9\nto  not in \nunder-the orders of this court  all districts  compliance\nwith \nthese findings, uniformity can soon be achieved.\nit Is hoped that each of the systems involved through\nthe state board will proceed to effectuate the results herein-\nafter directed as soon as possible, and that thereby, our people\nand teachers can more rapidly devote all of their energies to the\njob of educating our children, from which some have long departed\nin:. some quest for legalisms.\nTo that end, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DIRECTED until\nthe further order of the Court:\nA. That with respect to the school districts herein-\nafter enumerated the State Board of Education acting through the\nState Superintendent of Schools and the State Department of\nEducation is hereby temporarily enjoined from the payment of any\npublic funds except on the following conditions:\n(1) The school districts described in Appendix\nA attached hereto are deemed to be initially\nk ^(cid:9) affected by this Order; all other.districts\nwithin the State having already come under\nseparate Court orders or having satisfied the\nadministrative requirements of a unitary system.\n(2) The State Board is hereby directed to\nobtain desegregation plans from each of such\naffected districts, complying with the standards\n9Whieh account for a large percentage of all funds for public\neducation in the state.\n7..\n\nhereinbefore prescribed by the Court, on or\n,l\niV `i 10\nbefore March 1, 1-969-.\t Each plan shall show\nthe anticipated enrollment, by race and grade,\nfor each school.\n(3) The State Board is hereby directed to\nprocess and review all of such plans with the\naid and assistance of representatives of the\nAtlanta Regional Office of the Division of\nEqual Educational Opportunities of the Office\nof Education, Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare, and on or before April 1, 1970,\nto report their respective findings to the\nCourt, specifically stating whether the plan\nof each school district complies with the\nstandards established above by the Court.\n(4) Where any plan submitted on or before\nApril 1, 1970, does not comply with the above\nstandards, the State Board is further directed\nto endeavor to secure such compliance on or\nI\t\nbefore May 1, 1970.\n(5) Each of such plans shall be fully\nimplemented and effectuated no later than\n.September 1, 1970. To that end, the local\n.units will submit a report similar to the\none attached to this order as Appendix B to\nthe State Department of Education, with copies\nto the Atlanta Regional Office, Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare, on or before\nOctober 10, 1970, and October 10 each year\nl\n°ln this connection, we are not mindful of the dates stated in\nSingleton, et al v. Jackson Municipal School District, et al,\nsupra, and subsequent orders. However, that litigation involved\nschool districts already before the courts for as long as four\nyears, while this is the first hearing affecting any district\ninvolved here. Further, the resources of all parties concerned\ncould not possibly comply with any shorter time schedule. Lastly,\neven if the parties could the manpower of this court could not\neffectuate relief in the 60 districts simultaneously as would\notherwise be recuired.\n\nthereafter, showing the enrollment by race\nand grade of each school operated by the\n1970,\n'local unit. On or before November 1, \nand on or before November 1 of each succeeding\nyear, said office shall report to the Court\nits findings as to compliance by each affected\ndistrict for such action as may be deemed\nappropriate under the circumstances.\nB. No funds shall be paid by the State to any affected\n1970, \ndistrict which has not submitted a plan by March 1,  as\nprovided in A (2) above, or whose plan is not found by May 1,\n1970,  (4)\nto be in compliance by the Board as prescribed in A \nabove; or which plan is found by the Court not to have been\nimplemented on September 1, 1970, as directed by the Court's\nOrders thereafter.\nC. The districts Involved having been ordered to\ndesegregate and to establish a unitary public school system,\nsuch districts as are not now eligible for federal funds may now\nreapply for the same and, upon proper application, such funds\nshall be restored forthwith.\nD. Interested parties are directed to the opinion\nin the case of. Singleton, et al v.

PRESTON, Members;\nand JACK P. NIX, State Superintendent\nof Schools\nORDER OF THE COURT\nHaving concluded by separate orders entered on\nDecember 15, 1969, that we unquestionably have jurisdiction,\nand that all necessary parties are before us, we proceed to\nconsider the duty of the Defendant and the individual school\ndistricts as recently illuminated by Carter v. West Feliciana\nParish School Brd.,(cid:9) U. S.(cid:9) (No. 9I4, December 13,\n1969); Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education,(cid:9) U. S.\n(No. 632, October 29, 1969); and Singleton v. Jackson\nMunicipal Separate School District, ____ F.2d(cid:9) (5th Cir.,\nNo. 26285, December 1, 1969).\nk\nIt is now abundantly clear, to all save those who\nadamantly refuse to see or hear, that the supreme law of these\nUnited States provides that dual school systems must be completely\nabolished. United States v. Montgomery County Brd. of Ed., 23\nL. Ed.2d 213 (1969). In this case, it is the task of this court\nto determine how the application of this law affects the State\nBoard of Education and the schools of this State as a whole.\nWhile the mandate of the law is plain, what is not clear is just\nwhat is required of the local school systems. The lack of\n\nadministrators, school patrons, and citizens generally. The\ncourt firmly believes that whatever is required ought to be.\nrequired as uniformly as possible. In this respect, the higher\ncourts have not yet issued definitive rules as to just what steps\nare legally required of each local school district.\nThe question is not the legality of any HEW guidelines\nnor:-the right of any school district to federal funds. Nor does\nthe point of dispute here require the court to mold some\naccommodation between the two. The aim and ultimate requirement\nof_.-the.law clearly exists in the decisions of the Supreme Court,\nthe Fifth Circuit and other courts, and the results are demanded\nthere, without regard to any federal legislation or federal\nappropriation whatsoever.\nIt is obvious to this court that the task cannot be\naccomplished bymass litigation, school district by school\ndistrict, and even schoolhouse by schoolhouse, through the separat\nschool districts and schools of this state -- unless all other\nlegal business is to cease. The federal district courts have\nneither the numbers, the time, the capacity, nor the expertise to\nhear such litigation. Moreover, the prospect of courts acting as\nadministrators or \"super school boards\" is contrary to the\nI\nconcept of the judge's traditional role, and is anathema to our\nsystem of local public education. Nor are the courts unmindful\nof: the tremendous effect of housing patters- on school desegrega-\ntion,.particularly in urban areas. Even in enlightened school\ndistricts, the problem is compounded by racial population shifts\nand the concomitant resegregation of normal school attendance\nzones. In all candor, the eventual solution of the housing\nproblem may well solve the school problem, but such solution is,\nimminent.\nat this time, not \nMeanwhile, it is incumbent upon this court to provide\ndirection to all concerned. Because of the enormity of the\na\n\nproblems and the complexity of the details, the court adopts a\nplan to test results alone. This method appears to be the only\npractical approach open, and perhaps affords an opportunity to\ncreate some order in an emotional and confusing situation.\nThe ultimate question presented by this suit is: \"When\nis,a school district considered in compliance with law.\" Stated\n1 another way, when has a school district deemed to  have abolished\na. dual school system and when has it not? The court subscribes\nto:the idea that the question is best answered by judicial\ndefinition of an integrated, non-dual school district, or \"unitary\nsystem. Defining terminology is necessary, important and the\n1. beginning point for all such investigation. In this connection\nI and for purposes of the order which follows, the court adopts\nthe .following definitions:\nL \nSchool district. School district shall mean any com-\nbination of schools administered by a county, municipal,\nindependent or area school board and a central administrative\noffice, and considered an integral unit for the allocation of\nstate funds and administrative purposes by the State School Board\nand the State Superintendent of Schools.1\nMinority race. Minority race shall mean the race,\nblack or white, which constitutes less than half of the total\npupil enrollment, in any school district for any one regular\nschbol year, but shall not apply to any summer school or adult or\nspecial education courses afforded by the various school districts,\nMinority quotient. Minority quotient shall mean that\npercentage representing the proportion which the number of student!\n` 1As presently constituted, there are -192 school districts or\nsystems in Georgia: the 159 county school systems and the 33 so-\ncalled \"Independent\" city school systems in the larger incorporate(\nmunicipalities of the state. However, consolidation ofsuch city\nsystems into existing county school systems have proven, in most\ncases, to be advantageous economically and educationally.\nConsequently, the definition is prospective to include any future\nconsolidations.\n'A. .\n\nof a minority race bears to the entire pupil enrollment in any\nschool district.2\nFaculty and Staff. Faculty and staff shall mean all\nprofessional and certificated employees of a school district\nemployed in an administrative or teaching capacity, whether paid\nby state  local funds, but shall not include custodial,\nor \nmaintenance or lunch room employees, or school bus drivers of\nsuch district.\nFaculty quotient. Faculty quotient shall mean that\npercentage representing the proportion which the number of\nfaculty and staff members of one race, less than half, bears to\nthe total number of faculty and staff, as defined above, in any\nschool district.3\nSchool Activities. School activities shall mean any\nendeavor, other than academic, participated in by pupils or\nfaculty and staff of any school district in a student or faculty\ncapacity such as athletics, music, or any competition, meeting, or\nperformance involving one or more schools.\nEquality of standards. Equality of standards shall\nmean a uniform system of pay, employment, and selection for\nfaculty and a uniform system of curriculum offerings, testing,\nand assignment of pupils within a school district.\n1(cid:9) Integrated school facility. An integrated school•\nfacility shall mean any schoolhouse or school complex administered\nby a single school principal and containing one or more school\ngrades, and in which:\n2For example, if a particular district has 2000 pupils of which\n60% are white and l0% are black, the minority quotient for such\ndistrict is 40.\n3For example, if the same district has 75% white faculty and staff\nmembers, and 253 black, the faculty quotient for such district is\n25.\n4.\n\n(1) the ratio of minority to majority pupil population\nIs within 50% to 150 of the minority quotient,4 and each grade\ntherein has assigned to it pupils of both races enrolled in such\ngrade within the school;5 and\n(2) the ratio of-faculty and staff assigned to such\nfacility on a full-time basis is 50% to 150% of the faculty\nquotient; 6 system-wide personnel are to be counted in such ratio\nproportionately to the number of schools served; and\n(3) there exists \"equality of standards,\" and\n(4) \"school activities\" are open to all pupils and\nfaculty and staff, regardless of race.\nIntegrated school district. The object of this order\nis to eliminate the dual school system. - To that end and subject\nto the court's approval in instances where the following does not\nproduce such result, each system involved shall provide for an\nintegrated school district for the school year 1970-71 and each\nschool year thereafter in which:\n(1) in each and every school facility,\n(a) the ratio of faculty and staff assigned to\nsuch facility on a full-time basis is 50% to 150% of the faculty\nquotient; system-wide personnel are to be counted In such ratio\nproportionately to the number of schools served; and\n(b) there exists \"equality of standards,\" and\n(c) \"school activities\" are open to all pupils\nandkfaculty and staff, regardless of race;.and\n(2) three fourths of all pupils in a minority race are\nenrolled in integrated school facilities as hereinbefore defined\n4For example, an integrated school facility where the minority\nquotient is 40 must have 502 to 150% of the quotient enrolled. In\na school facility of 400, this would mean a spread of 80 to 240\npupils of the minority race.\nSFor example, if there are fourgrades within a bona fide attendance\n3 \narea, and fortuitously only  of such grades have students of the\nminority race, such facility shall not thereby lose its qualifica-\ntion as an integrated facility, provided the other standards are\nmet.\n61n the same example, if there are 20 faculty members and the facult\nquotient is t0, this would mean a spread of 4 to 12 faculty memberr-\nnP 4kn MI,i I4 r rono\n\nfor the school year 1970-1971; 7 and each school year thereafter;\nand\n(3) No geographic attendance zone shall be drawn on\nthe basis of race so as to provide that children enrolled in the\nsame grade of one race within such attendance zone attend a\ncertain school and children of another race within such attendancel\nzone attend another school, even though such pupils comprise less\n25% of the total  district.\nthan  enrollment in the \n(4) a bona fide plan exists permitting a student\nattending a school in which his race is in the majority to choose\nto attend another school, where space is available under the\n372\nstandards enunciated in United States v. Jefferson County, \n836 \nF.2d  (5th Cir. 1966) and where his race is in the minority.\nProvided a plan achieves the result of a unitary school\nsystem no particular plan is required; thus, it should be noted\nthat the abandonment of school buildings is neither required nor\nprohibited; the rezoning of school attendance areas is neither\nrequired nor prohibited; \"Freedom of Choice\" is neither required\npupils \nnor prohibited; the bussing8 of  is neither required nor\nprohibited; the \"pairing\" of schools is neither required nor\nprohibited; neighborhood schools are neither required nor\nprohibited. All of these are but means at the disposal of every\nlocal school board to achieve the necessary results. What is\ndesirable for one community may not be feasible for another, and\nfs \nit  the privilege of every local board to exercise wise\ndiscretion to find the means best suited to the needs of its own\npupils and patrons.\nHow best to monitor the progress? The state school\nboard and state superintendent's office are vested with vast\npowers to Inspect, to standardize, to recommend, and, moreover,\n7Such figures compare favorably with unified school systems\nthroughout the country.\n8Strangely enough, the 33 \"independent\" city school systems\nreceive no funds for transportation of pupils and consequently\nprovide no bussing whatsoever.\n\nLI\nto check the reliability of reported figures of each district.\nThe personnel are already available there, the information Is\nalready available there, and, above all, the educational expertise\nis : constantly available there. What might be complicated and\nobtuse to the court, is simple and mundane to such professional\neducators. By the simple process of withholding state funds9\nto  not in \nunder-the orders of this court  all districts  compliance\nwith \nthese findings, uniformity can soon be achieved.\nit Is hoped that each of the systems involved through\nthe state board will proceed to effectuate the results herein-\nafter directed as soon as possible, and that thereby, our people\nand teachers can more rapidly devote all of their energies to the\njob of educating our children, from which some have long departed\nin:. some quest for legalisms.\nTo that end, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND DIRECTED until\nthe further order of the Court:\nA. That with respect to the school districts herein-\nafter enumerated the State Board of Education acting through the\nState Superintendent of Schools and the State Department of\nEducation is hereby temporarily enjoined from the payment of any\npublic funds except on the following conditions:\n(1) The school districts described in Appendix\nA attached hereto are deemed to be initially\nk ^(cid:9) affected by this Order; all other.districts\nwithin the State having already come under\nseparate Court orders or having satisfied the\nadministrative requirements of a unitary system.\n(2) The State Board is hereby directed to\nobtain desegregation plans from each of such\naffected districts, complying with the standards\n9Whieh account for a large percentage of all funds for public\neducation in the state.\n7..\n\nhereinbefore prescribed by the Court, on or\n,l\niV `i 10\nbefore March 1, 1-969-.\t Each plan shall show\nthe anticipated enrollment, by race and grade,\nfor each school.\n(3) The State Board is hereby directed to\nprocess and review all of such plans with the\naid and assistance of representatives of the\nAtlanta Regional Office of the Division of\nEqual Educational Opportunities of the Office\nof Education, Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare, and on or before April 1, 1970,\nto report their respective findings to the\nCourt, specifically stating whether the plan\nof each school district complies with the\nstandards established above by the Court.\n(4) Where any plan submitted on or before\nApril 1, 1970, does not comply with the above\nstandards, the State Board is further directed\nto endeavor to secure such compliance on or\nI\t\nbefore May 1, 1970.\n(5) Each of such plans shall be fully\nimplemented and effectuated no later than\n.September 1, 1970. To that end, the local\n.units will submit a report similar to the\none attached to this order as Appendix B to\nthe State Department of Education, with copies\nto the Atlanta Regional Office, Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare, on or before\nOctober 10, 1970, and October 10 each year\nl\n°ln this connection, we are not mindful of the dates stated in\nSingleton, et al v. Jackson Municipal School District, et al,\nsupra, and subsequent orders. However, that litigation involved\nschool districts already before the courts for as long as four\nyears, while this is the first hearing affecting any district\ninvolved here. Further, the resources of all parties concerned\ncould not possibly comply with any shorter time schedule. Lastly,\neven if the parties could the manpower of this court could not\neffectuate relief in the 60 districts simultaneously as would\notherwise be recuired.\n\nthereafter, showing the enrollment by race\nand grade of each school operated by the\n1970,\n'local unit. On or before November 1, \nand on or before November 1 of each succeeding\nyear, said office shall report to the Court\nits findings as to compliance by each affected\ndistrict for such action as may be deemed\nappropriate under the circumstances.\nB. No funds shall be paid by the State to any affected\n1970, \ndistrict which has not submitted a plan by March 1,  as\nprovided in A (2) above, or whose plan is not found by May 1,\n1970,  (4)\nto be in compliance by the Board as prescribed in A \nabove; or which plan is found by the Court not to have been\nimplemented on September 1, 1970, as directed by the Court's\nOrders thereafter.\nC. The districts Involved having been ordered to\ndesegregate and to establish a unitary public school system,\nsuch districts as are not now eligible for federal funds may now\nreapply for the same and, upon proper application, such funds\nshall be restored forthwith.\nD. Interested parties are directed to the opinion\nin the case of. Singleton, et al v.

Based on a  review of the information provided by the District and other data, the \nUnited  States  advised the  District that,  in  its  view,  the  District has  fulfilled  its  affirmative \ndesegregation obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment and  applicable federal law, entitling \nthe District to a declaration of unitary status and termination of the litigation.  As indicated by the \nsignatures of counsel below, the parties  respectfully request that the Court approve this Agreed \nOrder of  Dismissal,  declaring that the District  has  achieved  unitary status  and terminate \njurisdiction over this case. \nl.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis case was originally filed on August I, 1969, by the United States against the State of \nGeorgia, 81 public school districts, and officials of the state.  United States v. State of Georgia, et \naI., C.A. No. 12972 (N.D. Ga.).  Charles Ridley, Jr., and others subsequently joined this action as \nPlaintiff-Intervenors to address statewide issues on behalf of black students. The United States and \nIntervenors alleged that Defendants operated a racially dual system of public education in violation \n\nCase 1:69-cv-12972-RLV   Document 364   Filed 03/03/08   Page 2 of 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.c. § 2000c-6. \nThe Court entered a number of orders for the purpose of effecting desegregation in the named school \ndistricts, including a detailed regulatory injunction entered on December 17, 1969, requiring each \nof the individual school districts to establish a fully desegregated school system in compliance with \nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).  On September 5,1972, in compliance with \ndirections by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the court issued an order adding as parties defendant \neach school district  in the state. \nBy Order ofJuly 23, 1973, the Court held that several school districts, including the Walker \nCounty School System, had made significant progress towards reaching unitary status.  Order of \n7/23173, at 3-4.  Accordingly, the Court dissolved the detailed regulatory injunction and replaced it \nwith a permanent injunction that required each of these school districts to take no action tending to \nracially segregate students or faculty by or within schools, and which addressed student transfers, \ntransportation, school construction, consolidation and site selection, and teacher hiring, assignment, \npromotion, dismissal, and pay.  Id. at 6-7.  The injunction required that \"[all! school construction, \nschool consolidation and site selection (including the location of any temporary classrooms) in the \nsystem shall be done in a manner which will prevent the reoccurrence of the dual school structure.\" \nrd. at 7.  Finally, the Court placed these school districts on the inactive docket, subject to being re-\nactivated on application by any party or on the Court's own motion.  rd. at 8. \nII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school desegregation case is to convert \npromptly a de jure segregated school system to a system without \"white\" schools or \"black\" schools, \nbut just schools.

The \nPage 2 of 5 \n\nCase 1:69-cv-12972-RLV   Document 364   Filed 03/03/08   Page 3 of 5\nstandard established by the Supreme Court for determining whether a school district has achieved \nunitary status, thus warranting termination of judicial supervision, is: (1) whether the school district \nhas fully and satisfactorily complied with the court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period \nof time; (2) whether the school district has eliminated the vestiges of past de jure discrimination to \nthe extent practicable; and (3) whether the school district has demonstrated a good faith commitment \nto the whole of the court's order and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution which were \nthe predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 87-\n89 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 491-92, 498 (1992); Board o{Educ. ofO  klahoma City \nPub. Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248-50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \"Green factors,\" which \nmust be addressed as part ofthe determination of whether a school district has fulfilled its duties and \neliminated vestiges ofthe prior dual school system to the extent practicable: (1) student assignment; \n(2) faculty; (3) staff; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and (6) facilities.  Green. 391 \nU.S. at 435; see Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250.  But the Green factors are not intended to be a \"rigid \nframework;\" the Supreme Court has approved consideration of other indicia, such as \"quality of \neducation,\" as important factors in determining whether the District has fulfilled its desegregation \nobligations.  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.  Regardless, \"[t]he measure of a desegregation plan is \nits effectiveness.\"  Davis v. Bd.  ofSch. Comm 'rs, 402 U.S. 33, 37 (1971). \nIII.  STIPULATED FACTS \nA.  Student Assignment.  The District currently operates fourteen schools: Chattanooga \nValley Elementary (Pre K - 5), Cherokee Ridge Elementary (Pre K - 5),  Fairyland Elementary \nSchool (Pre K - 5), Gilbert Elementary School (Pre K - 5),  Naomi Elementary School (Pre K - 5), \nPage 3 of 5 \n\nCase 1:69-cv-12972-RLV   Document 364   Filed 03/03/08   Page 4 of 5\nNorth Lafayette Elementary School (Pre K - 5), Rock Spring Elementary School (Pre K - 5), \nRossville Elementary School (Pre K - 5), Stone Creek Elementary School (Pre K - 5), Chattanooga \nValley Middle School (6-8),  Lafayette Middle School (6-8),  Rossville Middle School (6-8), \nLafayette High School (9-12), and Ridgeland High School (9 - 12). \nThe District enrolls approximately 9,179 students, just over five (5)  percent of whom are \nblack.  No school in the District enrolls more than seven (7) percent black students.  Classroom \nassignments are made on a non-discriminatory basis. The District  reported 733 net inter-district \ntransfers, none of which appear to be problematic. \nB.  Faculty and Staff.  The District employs approximately 652 teachers, 17 of whom are \nblack.  Faculty and staff are assigned to the district's schools on a non-discriminatory basis. \nC.  Extra-Curricular  Activities.

HAl2~Cler~ \nATLANTA  DIVISION  By: ~Ol6  DepuiyClerIE \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA  : \nPlaintiff, \nCHARLIE RIDLEY, et aI.,  CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:69-CV-12972 \n(Newton County School District) \nv. \nSTATE OF GEORGIA, et ai, \nDefendants \nAGREED ORDER OF DISMISSAL \nIn July, 2007, Newton County School District (\"District\") requested that the \nUnited States review the School District's compliance with its desegregation \nobligations under the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable federal law.  Based \non a review of the information provided by the District and other data, the United \nStates advised the District that, in its view, the District has fulfilled its affirmative \nobligations, entitling the District to a declaration of unitary status and termination \nof the litigation.  As indicated by the signatures of counsel below, the parties \nrespectfully request that the Court approve this Agreed Order of Dismissal, \ndeclaring that the District has achieved unitary status and terminate jurisdiction \nover this case. \nPage 1 of 7 \n\nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis case originally filed on August 1, 1969, by the United States against \nthe State of Georgia, 81 public school districts, including NCSD, and officials of \nthe State.  United States v. State of Georgia, et ai, C.A. No. 12972 (N.D.Ga.). \nCharles Ridley, Jr., and others subsequently joined this action as Plaintiff-\nIntervenors to address statewide issues on behalf of black students.  The United \nStates and Intervenors alleged that Defendants operated a racially dual system of \npublic education in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title IV ofthe \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000-6.  The Court entered a number of \norders for the purpose of effecting desegregation in the named school districts, \nincluding a detailed regulatory injunction entered on December 17, 1969, \nrequiring each of the individual school districts to establish a fully desegregated \nschool system in compliance with Brown v. Board ofE  ducation, 347 U.S. 483 \n(1954).  On September 5, 1972, in compliance with directions by the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, the Court issued an order adding as party defendants (if not \nalready made parties) 79 school districts in the state. \nBy Order of July 23, 1973, the Court ordered several school districts, \nincluding the Newton County School District, to continue to comply with all \nrequirements of the Court's Order of December 17, 1969, subject to subsequent \nPage 2 of 7 \n\nmodifications of the Order.  Order of 7/23/73, at 3-4.  Accordingly, the Court \ndissolved the detailed regulatory injunction and replaced it with a permanent \ninjunction that required each of these school districts to take no action tending to \nracially segregate students or faculty by or within schools, and which addressed \nstudent transfers, transportation, school construction, consolidation and site \nselection, and teacher hiring, assignment, promotion, dismissal, and pay.  Id. at 6-\n7. \nII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school desegregation case is to \nconvert promptly a de jure segregated school system to a system without \"white\" \nschools or \"black\" schools, but just schools.  Green v. County Sch. Bd. OfN  ew \nKent County, 391 U.S. 430, 442 (1968).  The standard established by the Supreme \nCourt for determining whether a school district has achieved unitary status, thus \nwarranting termination of judicial supervision, is: (1) whether the school district \nhas fully and satisfactorily complied with the court's desegregation orders for a \nreasonable period of time; (2) whether the school district has eliminated the \nvestiges of past de jure discrimination to the extent practicable; and, (3) whether \nthe school district has demonstrated a good faith commitment to the whole ofthe \ncourt's order and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution which were \nPage 3 of 7 \n\nthe predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.  See Missouri v. \nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 87-89 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491-92, 498 \n(1992); Board ofE  duc. of Oklahoma City Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, \n248-50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \n\"Green factors,\" which must be addressed as part of the determination of whether \na school district has fulfilled its duties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual \nschool system to the extent practicable; (1) student assignment; (2) faculty; (3) \nstaff; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and (6) facilities.  Green, \n391 U.S. at 435; see Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250.  But the Green factors are not \nintended to be a \"rigid framework;\" the Supreme Court has approved \nconsideration of other indicia, such as \"quality of education, \" as important factors \nin determining whether the District has fulfilled its desegregation obligations. \nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.  Regardless, \"[t]he measure of a desegregation plan \nis its effectiveness.\"  Davis v. Bd. ofSch. Comm'rs., 402 U.S. 33, 37 (1971). \nIII.  STIPULATED FACTS \nA.  Student Assignment.  The District currently operates twelve elementary \nschools:  East Newton, Fairview, Ficquett, Heard Mixon, Livingston, Mansfield, \nMiddle Ridge, Oak Hill, Palmer Stone, Porterdale, Rocky Plains and West \nPage 4 of 7 \n\nNewton; four middle schools:  Clements, Cousins, Indian Creek, and Veteran's \nMemorial; three high schools:  Alcovy, Eastside and Newton; and, one alternative \nschool:  Sharp Learning Center. \nThe District currently enrolls approximately 18,695 students, approximately \n50% of whom are black. School and classroom assignments are made on a non-\ndiscriminatory basis.  The District reported 122 inter-district transfers into the \nDistrict, none of which appear to be problematic. \nB.  Faculty and Staff.  The District currently employs approximately 1,489 \neducationally certified employees, 421 of whom are black.  Faculty and staff are \nassigned to the district's schools on a non-discriminatory basis. \nC.  Extra-Curricular Activities.  Extra-curricular activities are provided \non a non-discriminatory basis. \nD.  Facilities and Transportation.  These school system operations are \nprovided on a non-discriminatory basis. \nIn sum, there is no evidence that vestiges of segregation remain in any facet \nof the District's operations. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nBased on the information and data provided by the District, and on all the \nsurrounding facts, the District has complied with the Court's desegregation orders \nPage 5 of 7 \n\nfor a reasonable period of time and has eliminated the vestiges of past de jure \ndiscrimination to the extent practicable.  The Court concludes, therefore, that the \nNewton County School District has met the legal standards for a declaration of \nunitary status, and that it is entitled to dismissal of this action. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that all prior injunctions in this case \nare DISSOLVED, jurisdiction is TERMINATED, and this case is DISMISSED \nWITH PREJUDICE. \n----1fkrtf.~'\"\"---., \nff!7I \nENTERED this  day of  2008. \n~V~/~ \n~ST~TESDTJUDGE \nAPPROVED FOR THE NEWTON COUNTY \nSCHOOL DISTRICT \nHAWKINS \neorgia Bar No. 338750 \nAttorneys for Newton County School \nDistrict \n340 Jesse Jewell Parkway \nWachovia Center, Suite 750 \nGainesville, GA 30501 \n770-534-7341 \nAPPROVED FOR THE UNITED STATES \nPage 6 of 7 \n\nGRACE CHUNG BECKER \nActing Assistant Attorney General \nCivil Rights Division \nAttorney \nUnited States Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nEducational Opportunities Section \nPatrick Henry Building, Suite 4300 \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C.  20530 \n(202)514-4092 \nPage 7 of 7 ",

U.S., Ridley v. Georgia (Baker Co. School Dist.), 466 F.2d 487, we \n  reversed and remanded the decision of the District Court which had dismissed the motion of the United States for \nsupplemental relief. \n \n2  The pertinent parts of the decree of the District Court are reproduced as follows: \n \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED, that the Baker County School District, /1/ its officers, agents, \n1. This term refers to the Baker County School District, the Superintendent of Schools for Baker County and the \nBaker County Board of Education, all of whom have either been added as parties defendant in C.A. No. 1201 by the \ndistrict court order of August 21, 1972 or named as parties defendant by private plaintiffs in C.A. No. 1167. The \nrequirements of this order are applicable to all of these parties. \nemployees, successors, assigns, and all persons acting in concert or participation with it are hereby enjoined from \nproviding aid or assistance in any form (including, but not limited to, the transfer or loan of real or personal property \nor the provision of services) to the Baker Academy or any other private, segregated school or taking any other steps \nwhich would interfere with the orderly desegregation of the public schools of Baker County. In the case of any \nfuture sale or transfer of real property the defendant school district shall insert a reversionary clause in the deed of \nconveyance providing for the reversion of the property to the school district in the event that a segregated school is \nestablished or operated on the property. For the purposes of this order, a school is segregated if it does not have \n3 \n \n\n \n \nWright v. Baker County Bd. of Ed., 501 F.2d 131 (1974)   \n \n \nboth black students enrolled and black teachers employed to some significant extent, considering the racial \ncomposition of the area served by the school. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Baker Parents, Inc., /2/ its officers, agents, \n2. This term refers to the Baker Parents, Inc., and the members of the Board of Trustees of Baker Parents, Inc., who \nwere added as parties defendant by the district court order of August 21, 1972 and named as parties defendant by \nprivate plaintiffs in C.A. No. 1167. As the record in this case indicates that of the original members of the Board of \nTrustees of Baker Parents, Inc., (Mrs. Oliver Jones, Arthur E. West, Bernard C. Palmer, J. R. Rhodes, Sr. and Luther \nMoore), Mrs. Oliver Jones, Arthur E. West, and Luther Moore are no longer members and have been replaced by \nMrs. W. D. Drennon and J. W. Hendricks, the pleadings in C.A. No. 1201 and C.A. No. 1167 are hereby amended to \nreflect these changes. The requirements of this order are applicable to all of these parties. \nemployees, successors, assigns and all persons acting in concert or participation with it (hereinafter referenced as \nBaker Parents, Inc.) shall cease to operate the segregated Baker Academy or any other private, segregated school, at \nthe former West Baker facility and shall permanently vacate the premises upon the completion of the 1973-74 \nschool year, on or before June 15, 1974. After that date, the defendant Baker Parents, Inc., shall immediately \nattempt to sell the former West Baker facility and shall exercise due diligence in attempting promptly to obtain a \npurchaser for the property. The proceeds from the sale shall be disbursed as follows: \n1. First, the proceeds shall be used to pay off the outstanding, secured indebtedness of the capital improvements \nmade to the former West Baker facility by Baker Parents, Inc., prior to the filing of the motion and complaint in \nthese cases, except for those capital improvements which are removable. \n2. Second, all of the remaining proceeds from the sale, up to $6,000, shall be paid by Baker Parents, Inc., to the \nBaker County School District. \n3. Third, the Baker Parents, Inc., shall not use the proceeds from the sale to pay current operating expenses or \nindebtedness on past operating expenses until the Baker County School District has been paid the complete sum of \n$6,000. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within 15 days after the sale of the former West Baker facility, the Baker Parents, Inc., \nshall file with the Court, with copies served on all parties, a report indicating the following: (1) the date of the sale \n(2) the terms of the sale, including the name(s) and address(es) of the purchaser(s) and the price paid for the \nproperty (3) the purpose(s) to which the property will be put by the purchaser(s) (4) a detailed list of all of the \noutstanding secured indebtedness for capital improvements made to the former West Baker facility which the Baker \nParents, Inc., intends to pay off from the proceeds of the sale of the facility including (a) the name and address of \neach creditor (b) a description of each capital improvement (c) the date on which each capital improvement was \ncompleted (d) the total cost of each capital improvement and (e) the unpaid balance owed on each capital \nimprovement. None of the proceeds of the sale shall be paid out by the Baker Parents, Inc., until 30 days after the \nfiling of the above report. If the parties cannot reach agreement as to the proposed disposition of the proceeds of \nthe sale, objections shall be made within 30 days of the filing of the report and a hearing will be scheduled to \nresolve any dispute. All parties shall be permitted appropriate discovery in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, and the Baker Parents, Inc., shall make no payment for any disputed expense until final resolution by the \nCourt. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Baker Parents, Inc., shall insert a reversionary clause into the deed of conveyance \nof the former West Baker facility, providing for the reversion of the property to the Baker Parents, Inc., in the event \nthat a segregated school, as previously defined above, is established or operated on the property. A verified copy of \nthe deed of conveyance shall be filed with the report required above. \n4 \n \n\n \n \nWright v. Baker County Bd. of Ed., 501 F.2d 131 (1974)   \n \n \nAll prior orders in these cases not inconsistent with the provisions of the order shall remain in full force and effect. \n \n3  No action was taken by the United States or the plaintiffs in opposition to the sale until nearly a year after it was \n  made. It would be inequitable to deny recognition to those who hold secured obligations which were made during \nthe interim. \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n ",

Based.on a review of the infonnation and data provided by the District, the \nUnited States advised the City of Decatur School District that it has fulfilled its affinnative \ndesegregation obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable federal law, entitling \nthe District to a declaration of unitary status.  As indicated by the signatures of counsel below, \nthe parties respectfully request that the Court approve this Agreed Order of Dismissal, declaring \nthat the City of Decatur School District has achieved unitary status and dismissing this case. \n\nCase 1:69-cv-12972-RLV   Document 358   Filed 12/11/07   Page 2 of 13\nBy Order of July 23, 1973, the Court held that several school districts  though not the \no· \nCity of Decatur School District •• had made significant progress towards reaching unitary status. \nOrder of7123173, at 3-4.  Accordingly, the Court dissolved the detailed regulatory injunction and \nreplaced it with a permanent injunction that required each of these school districts to take no \naction tending to racially segregate students or faculty by or within schools, and which addressed \nstudent transfers, transportation, school construction, consolidation and site selection, and teacher \nhiring, assignment, promotion, dismissal, and pay.  rd. at 6·7. The injunction specifically \ncommanded that \"[alII school construction, school consolidation and site selection (including the \nlocation of any temporary classrooms) in the system shall be done in a manner which will \nprevent the reoccurrence of the dual school structure.\"  N.. at 7.  Finally, the Court placed these \n2 \n\nCase 1:69-cv-12972-RLV   Document 358   Filed 12/11/07   Page 3 of 13\nschool districts onthe inactive docket, subject to beillg re-activated on application by any party \nor on the Court's own motion. \"Id. at\"S. \nAs to the three remaining school districts --the City of Decatur School District, as well as \nthe Newton County and Rome City School Districts --the Court held that they would \"remain as \nactive parties to this cause and shall continue to comply with all of the requirements of this \nCourt's order of December 17, 1969, as subsequently modified ....\"   rd. at 4. \nOnDecember 4, 1979, the Court concluded, without objection by Plaintiff, that the City \nof Decatur School District desegregation case should be placed on the inactive docket.  Order of \n12/4179.  As it did with the earlier group of school districts, the Court \"retain[edl complete \njurisdiction to vacate this order and to reopen the action upon cause shown that further litigation \nis necessary.\" !s:L  There was little activity in this litigation between 1979 and 2003. \nIn January of2003, the Board of Education of the City of Decatur (\"Board\") asked its \nlegal counsel to review the above-captioned case and to provide the Board with an update on the \nstatus of the case and any orders issued in the case because the Board was undertaking a search \nfor a new superintendent who would be asked to devise a strategic plan for the school system. \nThe Board anticipated that the strategic plan might involve some form of school consolidation. \nIn May\" of 2003, approximately one month before the new superintendent assumed her \nresponsibilities and commenced work at the District, the United States contacted the District to \nrequest information concerning the operation of the District relative to the 1979 Order and \napplicable federal case law.  The District responded to the information request and, during the \nsame time period, the superintendent created a strategic plan with several options that proposed \nthe consolidation of six K-5 elementary schools into three K-3 schools and one 4-5 academy. \n3 \n\nCase 1:69-cv-12972-RLV   Document 358   Filed 12/11/07   Page 4 of 13\nThe consolidation plan wasshared with the United States in the Winter and Spring of 2004 and, \nafter meeting with the superintendent, Chair of the Board and the District's legal counsel; \nreviewing the information produced by the District; touring the District; and interviewing \nstakeholders, the United States approved the plan, finding that it comported with the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the Constitution of the United States and applicable federal law.  After numerous \npublic hearings, the Board subsequently adopted the strategic plan and implemented the \nconsolidation of the elementary schools commencing in the 2004-2005 school year. \nThe District shifted from six K-5 elementary schools to three K-3 elementary schools and \none 4-5 school.  Oakhurst Elementary School, Clairemont Elementary School, and Winnona Park \nElementary Scllool became the three K-3 schools; Glennwood Elementary School became the 4-\n5 .school.

LEGAL ANALYSIS \nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school desegregation case is to convert \npromptly a de jure segregated school system to a system without \"white\" schools or \"black\" \nschools, but just schools.  Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430,442 \n(1968).  The standard established by the Supreme Court for determining whether a school district \nhas achieved unitary status, thus warranting termination of judicial supervision, is: (1) whether \nthe school district has fully and satisfactorily complied with the court's desegregation orders for a \nreasonable period of time; (2) whether the school district has eliminated the vestiges of past de \njure discrimination to the extent practicable; and (3) whether the school district has demonstrated \na good faith commitment to the whole of the court's order and to those proviSions of the law and \nthe Constitution which were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.  See \nMissouri v. Jenkins. 515 U.S. 70,87·89 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts. 503 U.S. 467, 491·92, 498 \n(1992); Board ofEduc. of Oklahoma City Pub. Sch. v. Dowell. 498 U.S~ 237, 248·50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \"Green factors,\" \nwhich must be addressed as part of the determination of whether a school distrl.ct has fulfilled its \nduties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual school system to the extent practicable: \n(1) student assignment; (2) faculty; (3) staff; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and \n(6) facilities.  Qrsm 391 U.S. at 435.· ~ Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250.  The Green factors, \nhowever, are not intended to be a \"rigid framework;\" the Supreme Court has approved \n6 \n\nCase 1:69-cv-12972-RLV   Document 358   Filed 12/11/07   Page 7 of 13\nconsideration of other indicia, such as \"quality of education,\" as important factors in determining \nwhether the District has fulfilled its desegregation obligations.
