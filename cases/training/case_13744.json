Procedural History and Stipulated Facts \nThe United States initiated this lawsuit on July 10, 1970, seeking to enjoin defendants to \ndismantle Baker County School District's dual system based on race.  On that same date, this \ncourt entered an order requiring the United States and the Baker County School District to \ncollaborate in the preparation of a plan for the immediate conversion of the defendant school \ndistrict to a unitary non-discriminatory school system.  After consultation. the parties agreed to a \nschool desegregation plan.  On August 4, 1970, after considering the plan and finding that it in \ncompliance with constitutional requirements. the COUlt ordered that it be implemented \ncommencing with the 1970-71 school year.  The Court retained jurisdiction of the case until it \nfound that the dual system will not be or tend to be reestablished. \nThe plan approved by the Court required: all students in grades 9-12 to attend Baker \nCounty Senior High School with the Keller School providing the vocational education course \nofferings for high school students: all students in grades 7-8 to attend Baker County Junior High \n\nCase 3:70-cv-00636-HLA   Document 21   Filed 02/24/09   Page 2 of 6 PageID 78\nSchool; and elementary students attending a new school in the Glen S1. Mary areal and Maclenny \nSchool.  Desegregation of faculty, transportation, facilities and extra-curricular activities were \nalso required. \nOn May 7. 1980 the Court opined with respect to several school districts. including the \nBaker County School District: \nInjunctions ... have been in effect for at least seven years.  During \nthis time no new matters have been raised and defendants have \nfiled the required reports religiously.  From all appearances. it \nseems that defendants have taken a positive and productive attitude \ntoward remedying the discriminatory practices that once flourished \nin their school systems.  The Court now deems it time to remove \nthe case from the docket of active civil cases. \nThe case remains on the inactive docket. \nThe District successfully desegregated its schools.  For the 1972-73 school year, the \nDistrict enrolled approximately 2986 students of whom 639 (22%) were African-American. \nPursuant to the extant court order students were assigned to the Districts four schools as follows: \nSchool  African -American  White \nMacclenny Elementary School (grades K-6)  131(16.1%)  707 \n'Westside Elementary School (grades K-6)  215 (29.7%)  510 \nBaker JHS (grades 7-8)  98 (20.4%)  386 \nBaker Co. HS  (grades 9-12)  195 (23.1%)  656 \nThe District also desegregated its faculty assigning African-Amelican faculty at each \nschool was reflective of the district-wide average (within +/- 15%).  There is no evidence of \ndiscrimination in faculty and staff assignment, and there have been no complaints of \nIThe new school in Glen St. Mary was not scheduled to open until the 1971-72 school \nyear.  For the 1970-71 school year all elementary students from the Taylor School, Sanderson \nSchool and Glen St. Mary attendance areas would attend Taylor School and upon completion of \nthe new Glen S1. Mary School would then attend that school. \n2 \n\nCase 3:70-cv-00636-HLA   Document 21   Filed 02/24/09   Page 3 of 6 PageID 79\ndiscrimination filed with the EEOC or the Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights or \nthe Depat1ment of Justice's Educational Opportunities Section in the last 5 years. \nThe District has undergone substantial growth, however, it has maintained a desegregated \nstudent enrollment at each of its schools that reflect the overall racial composition of the District. \nFor the 2008-09 school year, the District enrolled approximately 4969 students of whom \n626(12.5%) were African-American.  Student were assigned as follows: \nSchool  African-American  White \nBaker County PKJKG Center (grades PK-KG)  73(11.5%)  533 \nMacclenny Elementary School (grades 1-3)  72 (14.2%)  420 \nWestside Elementary School (grades 1-3)  72 (10.5%)  586 \nJ Franklin Keller Intemlediate School (grades 4-6)  92 (13.1%)  585 \nBaker County Middle School (grades 6-8)  153 (13.5%)  944 \nBaker County Senior High (grades 9-12)  164 (12.4%)  1120 \nThe District has engaged in outreach activities to attract minority faculty and staff.  It is a \nmember of the N0I1h East Florida Educational Consortium which is comprised of 13 small, rural \ndistricts in north east Florida.  The Consortium employs a full time recruiter and has targeted and \nvisited colleges with substantial minority enrollments in the eastern part of the country, and has \nsponsored for the first time in June 2007 a Career Fair.  The District also partners with the \nFlorida Fund for Minority Teachers based out of the University of Florida in an attempt to attract \nminority faculty.  CUlTently, the district employs 330 teachers of whom 19 (5.7%) are minorities. \nFor the 2006-07 school year the District hired seven minorities for 33 positions, for  2007-08, \nfour minorities were hired,  and for the current school year, 2008-09,  of the ten teachers \nt\\VO \nhired (20%) were minorities. \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in the operation of the transportation system, \n3 \n\nCase 3:70-cv-00636-HLA   Document 21   Filed 02/24/09   Page 4 of 6 PageID 80\nfacilities or extra-curricular or other non-instmctional activities. \nII.  Legal Analysis \nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school desegregation case is to convert \npromptly a de jure segregated school system to a system without \"white\" schools or \"black\" \nschools, but just schools. Green, 391 U.S. at 442.  The standard established by the Supreme \nCourt for determining whether a school district has achieved unitary status, thus warranting \ntermination of judicial supervision. is: (l) whether the school district has fully and satisfactorily \ncomplied with the court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period of time; (2) whether the \nschool district has eliminated the vestiges of past dejure discrimination to the extent practicable; \nand (3) whether the school district has demonstrated a good faith commitment to the whole of the \ncourt's order and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution which were the predicate for \njudicial intervention in the first instance.  See lvlissOlfri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 87-89 (1995); \nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 491-92, 498 (1992); Board ofEduc. of Oklahoma City Pub. Sch. \nv. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248-50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \"Green factors.\" \nwhich must be addressed as part of the detennination of whether a school district has fulfilled its \nduties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual school system to the extent practicable:  (1) \nstudent assignment; (2) faculty; (3) staff; (4) transportation: (5) extracurricular activities; and (6) \nfacilities.  Green, 391 U.S. at 435; see Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250.  But the Green factors are not \nintended to be a \"rigid framework;\" the Supreme Court has approved consideration of other \nindicia, such as \"quality of education,\" as important factors in determining whether the District \nhas fulfilled its desegregation obligations.  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93. \n4 \n\nCase 3:70-cv-00636-HLA   Document 21   Filed 02/24/09   Page 5 of 6 PageID 81\nBased on the information and data provided by the District, and on all the surrounding \nfacts, the District has complied with the Court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period of \ntime and has eliminated the vestiges of past dejlll'e discrimination to the extent practicable.  The \nCourt concludes, therefore, that the Baker County School District has met the legal standards for \na declaration of unitary status, and that it is entitled to dismissal of this action. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that all prior injunctions in this case are \nDISSOLVED, jurisdiction is TERMINATED, and this case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nOF~ \n:l't \nENTERED THIS  DAY  2009. \n-\nuaSTAT~£O~_ \nAPPROVED: \nFOR THE UNITED STATES: \nLORETTA KING \nActing Assistant Attorney General \nCivil Rights Division \nomey \nUnited States Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nEducational Opportunities Section \nPatrick Henry Building \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue \nWashington, DC 20530 \n(202) 514-4092 \n5 \n\nCase 3:70-cv-00636-HLA   Document 21   Filed 02/24/09   Page 6 of 6 PageID 82\nFOR THE BAKER COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT: \n~~ \nJOHN W.
