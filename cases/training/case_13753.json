BACKGROUND \n1.  Plaintiffs  initiated this  action  on  September  5, \n1986  when  they  filed  a  Complaint  alleging  that  defendants \nmaintained  an  unlawfully  segregated  school  system  and  demanding \ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief.  Specifically,  the  Complaint \nalleged  that  on  May  17,  1954,  defendants  operated  a  racially dual \npublic  school  system  in  Fort  Wayne,  Indiana.  The  Complaint \nfurther  alleged  that,  subsequent  to  May  17,  1954,  defendants \nfailed  to  dismantle  the  dual  system  and  acted  or  failed  to  act  in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  alleged  conditions  of  segregation  in  the  Fort \nWayne  public  schools  were  maintained  and  exacerbated.  The \n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 2 of 16\nComplaint  sought  a  judgment,  among  other  types  of  relief: \n{a)  declaring  that  defendants  and  their predecessors  \"created, \nmaintained,  and  continue  to  perpetuate  a  racially dual  structure \nof  public  education\"  in  violation  of  federal  and  state  law; \n(b)  enjoining  defendants  from  future  unlawful  conduct;  and  (c) \nrequiring  defendants  to  \"develop  and  implement  an  equitable  plan \nof  desegregation which  will  .  .  .  remove  all vestiges  of  prior \ndiscrimination  from  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools.\" \n2.  This  action was  brought  as  a  class  action  by  a \nnot-for-profit  corporation,  Parents  for  Quality Education  With \nIntegration,  Inc.,  .and  22  named  minor  plaintiffs  and  their \n---~ \nparents  (or  persons  standing  in  loco parentis),  on  their own \nbehalf  and  on  behalf  of  all  other  children and  their parents  who \ncurrently  attend  or  who  will  in  the  future  attend  the  public \nschools  of  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools  Corporation.  The  class \nwas  certified by  the  Court  on  November  15,  1988,  and  consists  of \ntwo  subclasses:  the  first  comprised  of  all  such  black  children \nand  their parents;  and  the  second  comprised  of  all  such  white \nchildren  and  their parents  (hereinafter  \"plaintiffs''). \n3.  Originally,  the  defendants  in  this  action \nconsisted of  two  groups:  (a)  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools \nCorporation,  its Superintendent  of  Schools,  and  individual \nmembers  of  its Board  of  School  Trustees  (collectively referred  to \nhereinafter  as  \"FWCS  Defendants\");  and  {b)  the  State  of  Indiana, \nthe  Governor  of  the  State  of  Indiana,  the  Attorney General  of  the \nState  of  Indiana,  the  State  Superintendent  of  Puolic  Instruction \n- 2  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 3 of 16\nof  the  State  of  Indiana  (who  also  serves  as  Chair  of  the  Indiana \nState  Board  of  Education),  members  of  the  Indiana  State  Board  of \nEducation,  and  the  Indiana  Department  of  Education  (collectively \nreferred  to  hereinafter  as  \"State Defendants'').  Following  a \nsettlement  between  plaintiffs  and  FWCS  Defendants,  and  a  fairness \nhearing  on  December  14,  1989,  the  Court  approved  the  settlement \nagreement  and  entered  it as  a  consent  decree  in  an  opinion \nreported  as  Parents  for  Qualitv Education  With  Integration,  Inc. \nv.  Fort  Wayne  Communitv  Schools  Corp.,  728  F.  Supp.  1373  (N.D. \nInd.  1990) .  All  claims  against  the  FWCS  Defendants  were \ndismissed  with  prejudice.  Thereafter,  plaintiffs  proceeded  on \ntheir  claims  against  State  Defendants. \n4.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction over  the  subject \nmatter  of  this  action  and  over  the  parties,  as  determined  by  the \nCourt's  June  22,  1987  order,  granting  in part  and  denying  in part \nthe  motion  of  State  Defendants  to  dismiss.  See  Parents  for \nQuality Education  With  Integration,  Inc.  v.  Fort  Wayne  Community \nSchools  Corp.,  662  F.  Supp.  1475  (N.D.  Ind.  1987).  Venue  is \nproper before  this  Court.  On  October  23,  1992,  the  United  States \nCourt  of  Appeals  for  the  Seventh Circuit  affirmed  the  district \ncourt's  denial  of  State  Defendants'  motion  for  summary  judgment \nand  held  that  plaintiffs'  suit  was  not  barred by  the  Eleventh \nAmendment.  Parents  for  Quality  Education  With  Education,  Inc.  v. \nIndiana,  977  F.2d  1207  (7th  Cir.  1992). \n5.  Plaintiffs  and  State  Defendants  have  conducted \nextensive  discovery,  including  numerous  interrogatories, \n- 3  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 4 of 16\ndocuments  requests,  requests  for  admission,  and  depositions.  In \naddition,  these  parties,  at  the  direction of  the  Court  and  with \nthe  guidance  of  Magistrate  Judge  Roger  Cosbey,  have  engaged  in  a \nlengthy  stipulation process.  The  FWCS  Defendants  participated in \nsimilar discovery  before  their  settlement  with plaintiffs  and \ntheir  resulting dismissal  from  this  case.  They  also  assisted  in \nthe  stipulation process  before  that  dismissal  and,  thereafter, \ncounsel  for  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools  Corporation  assisted \nplaintiffs  and  State  Defendants  with  that  process  at  the  Court's \nrequest. \n6.  The  parties  to  this  Consent  Decree  are  plaintiffs, \n.. · \nState  Defendants,  and,  only  for  purposes  of  ensuring  the \nperformance  of  the  obligations  stated  in paragraphs  12(c),  13  and \n15  of  this  Consent  Decree,  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools \nCorporation.  Through  a  combination  of  the  previous  settlement \nbetween  plaintiffs  and  FWCS  Defendants  and  the  settlement  between \nplaintiffs  and  State  Defendants,  as  reflected  in  this  Consent \nDecree·,  all  claims  in  this  case  (except  for  plaintiffs'  claims \nfor  attorneys'  fees  against  State  Defendants)  are  resolved  with \nthe  entry of  this  Consent  Decree. \n7.  At  the  direction of  the  Court  and  with  the \nassistance  of  Magistrate  Judge  Roger  Cosbey,  who  this  Court \nappointed  to  preside  over  settlement  negotiations,  the  parties  to \nthis  Consent  Decree  have  sought  to  reach  a  fair  and  equitable \nsettlement  of  their differences  and  to  avoid  the  divisiveness  and \ncost  of  litigating the  claims  asserted by  plaintiffs. \n- 4  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 5 of 16\n8.  On  February  5,  1994,  counsel  (through  Magistrate \nJudge  Cosbey)  notified  the  Court  of  a  possible  settlement  and  the \nCourt  thereafter  set  a  hearing  for  February  11,  1994.  At  the \nFebruary  11,  1994  hearing,  the  parties  notified the  Court  of  the \nterms  of  the  proposed  settlement,  submitted  those  terms  to  the \nCourt  in writing,  and  asked  that  the  Court  give  preliminary \napproval  to  the  proposed  settlement.  By  order  dated  February  24, \n1994,  the  Court  preliminarily approved  the  proposed  settlement. \nAt  the  hearing  on  February  11,  1994,  the  Court  also  directed  the \nparties  to  submit  a  proposed  form  of  notice  to  the  class  of \nplaintiffs  of  that  proposed  settlement,  present  a  tentative \nschedule  for  giving  such  notice,  and  suggest  a  schedule  for \nconducting  other  appropriate  proceedings  with  regard  to  the \nproposed  settlement.  On  March  18,  1994,  the  Court  issued  an \norder  setting a  hearing  on  the  fairness  and  adequacy  of  the \nproposed  settlement,  approved  the  proposed  notice  submitted  by \nthe  parties,  and  adopted  the  schedule  for  such  notice  and \nproceedings  that  the  parties  had  submitted  jointly on  March  11, \n1994.  By  an  order  dated  April  8,  1994,  the  Court  modified  the \ndate  for  publication  of  the  notice  to  the  Plaintiff  Class. \n9.  Pursuant  to  the  Court's  order  of  March  18,  1994, \nnotice  to  the  class  (attached  as  Exhibit  \"A\")  and  the  full  text \nof  the  proposed  settlement  agreement  were  published  in  the \nfollowing  newspapers  published  in the  Fort  Wayne  area:  The  News-\nSentinel  (April  2,  1994);  Frost  Illustrated  (April  6-12,  1994); \nand  The  Journal  Gazette  (April  4,  1994)  (attached  as  Exhibit \n- 5  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 6 of 16\n\"B\").  The  published  notice  set  forth  procedures  governing  the \nfiling  of  comments  with  the  Court  and  participation by  members  of \nthe  class  of  plaintiffs  and  the  public  in  the  May  17,  1994 \nhearing  on  the  fairness  and  adequacy  of  the  proposed  settlement, \nas  embodied  in  this  Consent  Decree.  In  addition,  the  Fort  Wayne \nCommunity  Schools  Corporation  cooperated  with  plaintiffs  by \nmaking  copies  of  the  currently proposed  settlement  and  the  1990 \nConsent  Decree  (embodying  the  terms  of  the  settlement  between \nplaintiffs  and  FWCS  Defendants)  available  for  inspection  during \nregular  school  hours  at  the  Lester  L.  Grile  Administrative  Center \nof  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools  Corporation  and  in  the \nprincipal's  office  of  each  public  school  operated by  the  Fort \nWayne  Community  Schools  Corporation.  In  addition,  the  proposed \nsettlement  was  available  for  inspection  in  Fort  Wayne  at  the \nOffice  of  the  Clerk  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the \nNorthern  District  of  Indiana,  the  Old  Fort  YMCA  and  the  East \nWayne  Street  Center.  Plaintiffs  and  their  attorneys  also \nappeared  before  or  spoke  on  the  telephone  to  numerous  leaders  and \nofficials  of  area  civic,  religious,  and  business  organizations \nregarding  the  proposed  settlement,  including:  Arts  United; \nAssociated  Churches  of  Fort  Wayne  and  Allen  County;  The  Greater \nFort  Wayne  Chamber  of  Commerce;  The  Fort  Wayne  Journal-Gazette; \nIndiana/Purdue  University  at  Fort  Wayne;  Lincoln  National \nCorporation;  Lincoln  Life  Improved  Housing;  Fort  Wayne  branch  of \nthe  National  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Colored  People; \nNavistar  International;  FWCS  PTA  Council;  Southern  Heights \n- 6  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 7 of 16\nBaptist  Church;  Fort  Wayne  Urban  League;  and  the  office  of  Fort \nWayne  Mayor  Paul  Helmke. \n10.

FWCS does not want to revisit these issues in the future. That has always been a prime motivation for \nFWCS to settle, for, otherwise, these issues could never be laid to rest without actually litigating them. \nPlaintiffs’ position is that the agreed-upon provisions of this Paragraph, and other provisions of the Decree (e.g., \nSection 15, providing for dismissal with prejudice), provide the future protection FWCS seeks, and that new \nlanguage should not be added at this late date. Plaintiffs are unaware of any way in which the decree could be used \nto affect FWCS’ interests adversely in any separate proceeding. Moreover, the impact of this Decree on plaintiffs in \nanother, speculative proceeding should not be adjudged in this proceeding. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  10 \n ",

As  indicated orally,  on December 14,  1989,  this consent \ndecree  is  the  result  of  long,  arduous  and  difficult  negotiations \ninvolving  counsel  for  the  parties  to  this  case;  other  interested \npersons;  the Honorable  Gene  B.  Lee,  united states Magistrate;  and, \nindeed,  this  court.  The  fairness  hearing  indicated  that,  while \nvarious  interest and  community  groups  were  not  unanimous  in  their \nsupport  of  this  consent  decree,  there  was  significant  widespread \nsupport  for  it.  This  is  said  with  the  full  understanding  that \nthere  was  lack  of  support  for  the  decree  from  some  members,  a \nminority,  of  the  current  school  board  of  the  Fort Wayne  Community \nSchools  corporation. \nOne  does not have to live long  in the federal  jUdiciary at the \ndistrict  court  level  to  learn  that  there  are  hard  and  difficult \nrealities in the decisional process of these cases,  which represent \na  second  or  third  generational  legacy  of  Brown  v.  Board  of \n2 \n\nEducation,  347  U.S.  483  (1954).  It is also readily apparent  in the \nrelevant  decisional  law  in  this  circuit that these  kinds  of  class \nactions  generate  a  favorable  judicial  attitude toward  settlement. \nSee,  ~, Armstrong  v.  Board  of  School  Directors,  616  F.2d  305, \n312  (7th  Cir.  1980).  Several  decisions  of  this  court  relating to \nthe  school  desegregation  of  the  South  Bend  Community  schools  are \nin  the  same  vein.' \nThere  are under Armstrong  several  factors  to be considered  in \nevaluating  the  fairness  of  a  proposed  settlement: \n1.  The  strength of  the  plaintiff's case  on  the  merits \nbalanced  against  the  relief  offered  in  the \nsettlement; \n2.  the  defendant's  ability to pay; \n3.  the  complexity,  length,  and  expense  of  further \nlitigation; \n4.  the  amount  of  opposition to  the  settlement; \n5.  whether  the  settlement  is the  product  of  collusion; \n6.  the  reaction  of members  of  the  class  to  the  settlement; \n7.  the  opinion  of  competent  counsel; \n8.  the stage of the proceedings  and  the amount  of di.scovery \ncompleted. \nArmstrong,  616  F.2d  at  314. \n'See  Britton  v.

Ind.  1981),  aff'd  692  F.2d \n623  (7th  Cir.  1982). \n3 \n\nThe  plaintiffs alleged  in their complaint the  existence of an \nunremedied,  system-wide  violation  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment's \nequal protection clause,  perpetrated by the defendants' maintenance \nof  a  racially  dual  system  of  schools.  If  these  facts  were  to  be \nproved  at  trial,  there  would  be  an  adequate  legal  basis  for  the \nsystem-wide  remedy  requested  by  these  plaintiffs. \nThe  record  in  this  case  is  reflected  in  eighteen  pages  of \ndocket sheet entries.  A sUbstantial portion of the entries relates \nto discovery requested and provided.  Obviously,  this court was  not \nin  a  position  finally  to evaluate  the  strength  of  the  plaintiff's \ncase  on  the  merits.

Mich. \n1973),  aff'd,  508  F.2d  779  (6th  eire  1974). \nThe  court proceeds  to  address  the various  Armstonq  factors: \n1.  The  relief  provided  for  in  this  settlement  affects  the \nsystem-wide  structure  of  the  Fort  Wayne  schools.  The  technique \nused  is the  so-called tlmagnet  schools,tI  which  have  come  to be used \nwidely  in desegregation  school  plans  and  are  regarded  as  offering \nadvantages  of  parental  choice  and  educational  opportunity  and \nimprovement.  There  are also back-up systems  provided  in the event \nthe  magnet  schools  alone  are  not  adequate  for  their  expressed \npurpose. \nSome  decree provisions provide  for the equitable treatment of \nall  students,  while  others  address  interracial  understanding  and \nthe  needs  for  educational  improvement  of  children  at  risk  of \nacademic  failure.  There is a  mechanism for monitoring the progress \nunder  the  settlement and  provisions  regarding  circumstances  after \n1996-97  when  racial  balance  ratios  are  no  longer  to. be  required. \nAs  indicated  orally,  not  all  provisions  are  perfect  and  probably \ndo  not  satisfy anyone  totally.  However,  the court finds  the terms \nmore  advantageous  to  all  concerned  than  further  litigation.  In \nshort,  the agreement  strikes a  happy  and  agreeable balance,  though \nnot  a  perfect one. \n5 \n\n2.  with  regard  to  the  ability to pay,  this  factor  is not  as \nimportant as  class actions  in the private commercial  context under \nRule  23  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  civil  Procedure.  However,  there \nis  a  provision  for  payment,  including  additional  and  supplemental \nlegislation  relating  thereto,  some  of  which  has  already  been \nenacted. \n3.  The  court  has  spoken  at  length  on  the  wrenching  and \ndivisive  impact  on  a  community  that  emanates  from  protracted \nlitigation  of  this  sort.  The  court  knows  all  too  well  of  such \nproblems  in other communities.  with  this settlement the court has \nmade  every  reasonable  effort  to  avoid  precisely  those  kinds  of \ndivisive circumstances  from  occurring  in Fort Wayne.  This  special \nkind  of  litigation  is  extremely  costly  to  all  concerned  and  can \nbe,  as  indicated  in many  reported decisions,  protracted as well  as \ndivisive.  It is  extremely  important  that  such  adverse  effects  be \navoided  in  this  case. \n4.  Comments  have  already  been  made  regarding  the  wide  array \nof  organizations  and  individuals  that  support  this  settlement, \ntaking  into  account  the  honest  and  forthright  opposition thereto. \nThe  court  orally  carne  down  strongly  on  the  side  of  those  who \nfavored,  over  those  who  opposed,  the  settlement  and,  considering \nthe  general  nature  of  this  subject,  the  opposition  seemed  to  this \ncourt  to  be  very  temperate. \n5.  There  is not a  shred  of evidence  indicating any  collusion \nin this case.  During many  meetings with this court and  with then-\nUnited  states  Magistrate  Gene  B.  Lee,  there  were  strong \n6 \n\ndisagreements.  Some  dis;agreements  were  still  evident  in  the \nfairness  hearing  held  in  Fort Wayne  as  late as  December  14,  1989, \nthereby  negating  any  inference  of  collusion. \n,  ' \n6.  While  some  members  of  the  class  raised  questions,  most \nmembers  of the class,  by the record,  supported the settlement,  with \nthe support far outweighing any opposition.  The  support  indicates \nthat most  of the members  of the class view this as  a  good  and  fair \nsettlement. \n7.  The  court  was  fortunate  to  have  the  parties  represented \nby  extremely able and highly competent counsel  on both sides.  Mr. \nTaylor  and  others  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiffs  were  seasoned  and \nvery  experienced  civil  rights  lawyers  whose  record  in  school \ndesegregation  cases  is monumental.  At  the  same  time,  the  lawyers \nrepresenting  the  school  board  brought  to  their  task  a  wealth  of \nexperience  in  representing  school  corporations  in a  wide  range  of \nproblems.  For  example,  in  the  protracted  administrative \nproceedings that preceded this case and  involved the united States \nof America and  its administrative agencies,  some of the lawyers who \nrepresented  the  school  board  in that  ordeal  were  also  involved  in \nthis  process. \nWhile  there  were  nuances  in  the  case,  even 'at  the  end,  in \nwhich  there  were  differences  of  opinion,  the  principal  thrust  of \nthe  opinions  of  the  lawyers  involved  overwhelmingly  favored  the \napproval  of  this  agreement. \n8.  As  indicated above,  there was  a  mass  of discovery done  in \nthis  case  up  to  the  time  of  the  settlement.  The  proceedings  were \n7 \n\non the verge of trial.  The  court had set a  definite trial date and \nindicated to counsel  a  firm resolution to go  forward with the trial \non  that  date.  That  was  a  factor  in  the  whole  of  the  settlement. \ncertainly,  the  discovery  gave  the  lawyers  for  all  the  parties  a \nclear  insight  into the  factual  presentations  that were  to  be  made \nfor  all  the  parties. \nThis  court  finds  that the  settlement  is  fair,  reasonable  and \nadequate.  It is a  fair,  reasonable and  adequate  resolution of the \nplaintiff's  allegations  against  the  so-called  Fort  Wayne  School \ndefendants,  namely  Fort  Wayne  Community  schools  Corporation;  Dr. \nBill C.  Anthis,  Superintendent of the Fort Wayne  community Schools; \nAnn  K.  Silletto,  President  of  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  schools \nBoard  of  School  Trustees;  Stephen  Corona;  Richard  T.  Soermer; \nRonald  G.  Kleopfer;  Dr.  Bernard  Stuart;  Dr.  Jeff  H.  Towles,  and \nEugene  A.  Yergens,  Members  of  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools \nBoard  of  School  Trustees. \nAccordingly,  it is hereby  ordered,  adjudged  and  decreed  that \nthe proposed settlement as  embodied  in the attached consent decree \nis  adopted,  and  the  decree  will  be  implemented;  that  the  action \nagainst the  Fort Wayne  Community  ~chools, members  of the board and \nthe  superintendent  is  DISMISSED  WITH  PREJUDICE,  and  jurisdiction \nwill  be  retained  during  the  term  of  the  consent  decree  regarding \n8 \n\nits  implementation.  Each  party  will  bear  its  own  costs  and \nattorney  fees. \n2j-, \nDATED:  January  1990. \nNORTHERN  DISTRICT  OF  INDIANA \n9 \n\n\n\n\\\\~r~~A' \nCONSENT  DECREE \nI. \n1.  Plaintiffs  initiated this  action  on  September  5,  1986 \nwhen  they  filed  a  complaint  alleging  that defendants  maintained \nan  unlawfully  segregated  school  system  and  demanding  declaratory \nand  injunctive  relief.  The  complaint  specifically alleged  that \non  May  17,  1954,  defendants  operated  a  racially dual  public \nschool  system  in  Fort Wayne,  Indiana.  The  complaint  further \nalleged  that  subsequent  to May  17,  1954,  defendants  failed  to \ndismantle  the  dual  system  and  acted  or  failed  to  act  in  such  a \nmanner  as  to  maintain  and  to  exacerbate  conditions  of  segregation \nin  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  schools.  The  complaint  sought  a \njudgment,  inter alia:  a)  declaring  that  defendants  and  their \npredecessors  IIcreated,  maintained,  and  continue  to  perpetuate  a \nracially dual  structure  of public  education  in violation  of \nII \nfederal  and  state  law;  b)  enjoining  defendants  from  future \nunlawful  conduct:  and  c)  requiring  defendants  to  \"develop  and \nimplement  an  equitable  plan  of  desegregation  which  will  ... \nrern~ve all vestiges  of  prior discrimination  from  the  Fort  Wayne \ncommunity  Schools.1I \n2.  This  action  was  brought  as  a  class  action  by  a  not-for-\nprofit corporation,  Parents  for  Quality  Education  with \nIntegration,  Inc.,  and  by  22  named  minor  plaintiffs and  their \nparents  or  persons  standing  in  loco  parentis  on  their own  behalf \nand  on  behalf  of  all  other children  and  their parents who \npresently  attend  or who  will  in  the  future  attend  the  Fort Wayne \n\ncommunity  Schools.  The  class  was  certified  by  the  Court  on \nNovember  15,  1988,  and  consists  of  two  subclasses;  one  comprised \nof  black  children  and  their parents  and  the  second  comprised  of \nwhite  children  and  their parents. \n3.  Defendants  are  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools \nCorporation,  its Superintendent,  and  individual  members  of  the \nBoard  of  School  Trustees  (\"FWCS  Defendants\")  and  the  State  of \nIndiana,  the  Governor,  Attorney  General,  Superintendent  of  Public \nInstruction,  and  individual  members  of  the  State  Board  of \nEducation  (\"State  defendants\"). \n4.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction over  this  action  and  over \nthe  parties,  as  determined  by  the  Court's  order  dated  June  22, \n1987,  granting  in  part  and  denying  in  part  the  motion  of  State \nDefendants  to  dismiss.  Venue  is  properly  laid  in  this  Court. \n5.  The  parties  to  this  Decree  have  conducted  extensive \ndiscoveiy,  including  numerous  interrogatories  and  document \nrequests. \n6.  The  only  parties  to  this  Decree  are  the  certified class \nof  plaintiffs  (\"plaintiffs\")  and  the  FWCS  defendants.  The  Court \nduly  notes  that plaintiffs'  case  against  the  state defendants  is \nas  yet  unresolved. \n2 \n\n7.  At  the  direction  of  the  Court  and  with  the  assistance \nof  the  Magistrate  appoin~ed by  the  Court  to  preside  over \nsettlement  negotiations,  the  parties  to  this  Decree  have  sought \nto  reach  a  fair  and  equitable  settlement  of  their differences  and \nto  avoid  the  divisiveness  and  cost  of  litigating plaintiffs' \nclaims.  On  September  28,  1989,  plaintiffs  and  FWCS  Defendants \njointly moved  the  Court  for  preliminary  approval  of  the \nsettlement  agreement  embodied  in  this  Decree.  By  order dated \nOctober  12,  1989,  the  Court  preliminarily  approved  the  proposed \nsettlement,  directed the  parties  to  give  notice  to  the  class,  and \nset and  prescribed procedures  for  a  fairness  hearing  on  the \nsettlement. \n8.  Pursuant  to  the  Court's  order  of  October  12,  1989, \nnotice  to  the  class  (Appendix  A)  and  the  full  text  of  the \nproposed  agreement  were  published  in  the  following  Fort  Wayne \nNewspapers:  The  News-sentinel  «October  25,  1989),  Frost \nIllustrated  (October  25,  1989),  and  the  Journal  Gazette  (October \n26,  1989)  (Appendix  B).  \"The  published  notice  set  forth \nprocedures  governing  the  filing  of  comments  with  the  Court  and \nparticipation by  class members  and  the  public  in  the  fairness \nhearing.  In  addition,  plaintiff PQEI  mailed  letters to  68 \ncommunity  organizations  and  leaders  informing  them  of  the \nproposed  settlement,  attaching  a  copy  of  the  notice,  and \nproviding  instructions  for  submission  of  comments  to the  Court. \nPlaintiffs  and  their attorneys  also  appeared  before  or  spoke  via \n3 \n\ntelephone  regarding  the  proposed  settlement  to  numerous  leaders \nand  officials  of  civic,  ~eligious,  and  business  organizations, \nincluding:  the  Fort  Wayne  Urban  League,  the  Fort  Wayne  Branch  of \nthe  National  Association  for  Advancement  of  Colored  People,  the \nMetropolitan  Human  Relations  commission,  and  the  Fort  Wayne \nChamber  of  Commerce. \n9.  On  December  14,  1989,  the  Court  convened  a  hearing  in \nFort  Wayne  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  fairness  and \nadequacy  of  the  proposed  settlement  to  the  plaintiff class. \nPursuant  to  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  October  12,  1989 \norder;  32  class  members,  individual  citizens  and  organizations \nsubmitted  written  comments  on  the  fairness  and  adequacy  of  the \nproposed  settlement.  Four  of  the  commentators  elected  to  make \noral  presentations  at  the  fairness  hearing. \n10.  FWCS,  the  Board  and  the  Superintendent  have  denied  and \ncontinue  to  deny  that  they  or  their predecessors  have  committed \nany  wiongdoing  or  that\" they  oi any  of  their predecessors  have \ncaused .racial  isolation  in  the  Fort  Wayne  public  schools  to  the \nextent  that  such  isolation  exists  at  present  or  has  ever  existed. \nNothing  in  [these  findings  or  in]  the  Decree  shall  constitute  an \nadmission  of  liability or wrongdoing  on  the  part  of  FWCS,  the \nBoard,  or  the  Superintendent,  or  any  of  their predecessors. \n[nor  shall  the  Decree,  any  portion  of  the  Decree  or  any  of  the \nfacts  alleged  in  plaintiffs'  complaint  be  deemed  evidence  of  any \n4 \n\nwrongdoing,  cumulatively  or  otherwise,  in  these  or  in  any  other \nproceedings  against  the  FWCS  defendants  or  their  successors.]l \n11.  In  a  joint motion  filed  on  September  27,  1989,  seeking \nthe  Court's  preliminary  approval  of  the  settlement  agreement, \nPlaintiffs  and  FWCS  defendants  agreed  that,  \"prior to  any \nseverance  of  plaintiffs'  claims  against  the  state defendants  from \nthese  proceedings  against  FWCS  defendants,  FWCS  defendants  should \nconfirm  certain  factual  matters  that they  have  helped  develop \nthrough  discovery  to  date,  and  that  such  fact  stipulations  will \nassist  the  Court  and,  unless  disputed  by  state defendants,  will \nsave  valuable  trial  time  in  any  subsequently  severed  proceedings \nbetween  plaintiffs and  State  defendants.\"  The  memorandum \naccompanying  the  joint motion  also  included  a  specification  of \nthe  matters  subject  to  the  stipulations. \n1  FWCS  defendants  believe  the  Decree  should  include  language \nin  the  nature  of  the  bracketed  []  portions  of  this  Paragraph, \nwhile  plaintiffs believe this  language  is  unnecessary  and, \ntherefore,  have  not  agreed  to  its inclusion  in  the  Decree. \nFWCS'  position  is  that  there  should  at  least be  this \nprecatory  reference  to  the  fact  that  all  allegations  and  issues \nsubsumed  within  the  litigation,  not  just the  oprerative  language \nof  the  decree  itself,  have  been  relegated  to  the  archives.  FWCS \ndoes  not  want  to  reyisit these  issues  in  the  future.  That  has \nalways  been  a  prime  motivation  for  FWCS  to  settle,  for, \notherwise,  these  issues  could  never  be  laid to  rest without \nactually  litigating them. \nPlaintiffs'  position  is that  the  agreed-upon  provisions  of \nthis  Paragraph,  and  other  provisions  of  the  Decree  (e.g.,  section \n15,  providing  for  dismissal  with  prejudice),  provide  the  future \nprotection  FWCS  seeks,  and  that  new  language  should  not  be  added \nat  this  late date.  Plaintiffs  are  unaware  of  any  way  in  which \nthe  decree  could  be  used  to  affect  FWCS'  interests  adversely  in \nany  separate  proceeding.  Moreover,  the  impact  of  this  Decree  on \nplaintiffs  in  another,  speculative  proceeding  should  not  be \nadjudged  in  this  proceeding. \n5 \n\nII. \n1.  Racial  Balance \nFWCS  will  guarantee  racial  balance  results  by  a \ndate  certain and  within  a  specific  range  of  racial \nbalance  throughout  the  system,  as  is  set  forth \nmore  fully  in  sections  6  and  7  of  this  Decree. \n2.  (a)  Racial  Balance  Plan \nThe  racial  balance  plan will  rely primarily  on \nvoluntary methods.  All  methods  used  will  be \neducationally sound,  but,  in  carrying  out  the \nterms  and  conditions  of  this  Decree,  FWCS  will \nexercise  its own  judgment  and  discretion as  to \nmatters  such  as  programming,  staffing  and \ncurriculum. \n2.  (b)  Magnet  Staffing \nFWCS  has  an  administrative  procedure  for  the \nselection  of  the  best personnel,  including \nprincipals  and  staff,  for  each  of  its schools, \nincluding magnet  schools,  and  will  continue  to \nemploy  such  procedures  for  the  magnet  schools \ncontemplated by  this  Decree.  Such  procedures \nwill  recognize  the  special  needs  that magnet \nschools  have. \n6 \n\n2.  (c)  Transportation  and  Extracurricular Activities \nstudents _who  are  enrolled  in  schools  other  than \nthose  in  their horne  attendance  district will  be \neligible  for  and  encouraged  to participate  in  all \nschool  programs,  including  academic,  athletic and \nextracurricular activities.  Similarly,  parents  of \nsuch  children will  be  encouraged  to participate  in \nparent-teacher conferences,  PTA  organizations,  and \nvoluntary  parent  programs  at the  schools. \nFWCS  will  take  steps  in  accordance  with  the \nfollowing  paragraph  to  facilitate both  parents' \nand  children's  full  participation  in  school \nactivities,  including but  not  limited  to  the \nprovision  of  extracurricular buses  and  other  forms \n-of  transportation  where  needed. \nTransportation  (including  approved  extracurricular \ntransportation  and  transportation  for  approved \n'special  parent-ceritered  programs  or  events)  will \n~ \n-be  provided  by  FWCS  for  all  students  from  the \nBunche,  Young,  Irwin,  and  Ward  attendance  areas  to \n(i)  all magnet  schools  and/or magnet  programs \ncontemplated  by  the  Decree,  (ii)  a  reasonable \nnumber  of voluntary  racial  balance  transfer \nschools,  and  (iii)  all  reassignment  schools,  all \nin  accordance  with  FWCS'  transportation  standards \n7 \n\nand  policies.  A  transportation  allowance  will \nalso  be  p.rovided  by  FWCS  to  students  who  transfer \nto voluntary  racial  balance  transfer  schools  other \nthan  those  contemplated  by  2(c) (ii)  of  this \nparagraph. \n3 .  Obligatory  Back-Up \nIf the  racial  balance  goals  set  out  in  section  6 \nof  the  Decree  are  not  met  through  the  voluntary \nmethods  specified  in  sections  2  and  7  of  the \nDecree  by  the  school  year  1991-92  FWCS  will \ninstitute  such  other methods,  which  may  include \nstudent  reassignment,  as  are  necessary  to \naccomplish  the  goals.  The  methods  for  carrying \nout  any  needed  obligatory  back-up  will  be  selected \nby  FWCS  but will  not  require  any  additional \napproval  by  the  Board. \n4 .  Marketing  of  Plan \nFWCS  will  undertake  a  vigorous  effort to  market \nthe  magnet  programs/schools  to  parents,  students \nand  the  community.  such  efforts  will  include \nsteps  to  recruit voluntary  transfers,  to  encourage \nstudent  selections  of  alternatives,  to  encourage \nevery  parent  and  student  to make  a  school  choice, \nand  to  inform  parents  how  to  choose  among \n8 \n\nalternatives  for  their children.  The  goal, \nsystem-w~de,  is  for  every  parent  to  be  equitably \ntreated and  to  be  afforded  his  or her  first  choice \nof  school.  If a  student  is  not  assigned  to  the \nparent's  first  choice  school,  FWCS  personnel  will \ncontact  the  parent  and  attempt  to devise  and  to \nexplain other attractive  options  before \nreassigning the  student  to  another  school.  Each \nyear,  FWCS  will  undertake  to  inform  all  students \nof  the  availability of  educational  alternatives, \nwith  a  concerted  effort directed  to  students  in \nthose  schools  which  reflect  racial  isolation. \nFWCS  will  establish a  recruitment  and  counseling \ncenter,  and,  among  other  things,  will  publish  and \nwidely  disseminate  a  booklet  describing  all \nprograms  and  opportunities  and  the  procedure  for \napplication. \n5.  Magnet  Schools  . \nIn  establishing'and maintaining magnet  schools, \nFWCS  will  retain neighborhood  attendance  areas  for \nthe  purpose  of  giving  priority  in  admission  into  a \nmagnet  school  to  children  of  that  attendance  area. \nSuch  priorities  are  subject,  however,  to  the \ndominant  concerns  of  affording  parents  choices \nbased  on  interest and  maintaining  racial  balance \n9 \n\nin  the  magnet  schools.  Any  child  displaced  by \ncreation  pf  a  magnet  school  will  be  given  priority \ninto  any  other magnet  school  or  program.  FWCS \nwill  provide  aggregate  openings  in  its magnet \nschools  to  black students  at  least proportionate \nto  the  number  of  black  students  in  the  elementary \nschools.  FWCS  will  equitably  apportion  the  number \nof  magnet  opportunities  in  schools  that  are  now \npredominantly  white,  to  insure  that  black  parents \nhave  meaningful  choices  for  their  children. \nFWCS'  policy  on  magnet  admission  priorities  as \npresently constituted  or  amended  from  time  to  time \nin  a  manner  not  inconsistent  with  the  requirements \nof  this  Decree,  is  incorporated  by  reference. \nNo  admission  requirements  will  be  imposed  for \nentrance  to magnets,  other  than  interest  and \nracial  balance  considerations.  The  only  exception \nthat will  be  permitted  is  for  a  talented  and \ngifted  program  or  school,  provided  that  admission \nis  by  non-discriminatory  criteria  and  that  steps \nare  taken  to  insure  the  attainment  of  racial \nbalance  goals  within  the  standards  outlined  in  the \nDecree. \n10 \n\n6.  Racial  Balance  Range \nThe  system-wide  racial  balance  goal  is  15  percent \nto  45  percent black  (and  55  percent to  85  percent \nwhite)  but  full  compliance  and  performance  will  be \ndeemed  to  exist so  long  as  no  school  falls  below \nthe  10  percent black  range  and  no  more  than  three \nschools  fall  into the  45  percent  to  50  percent \nblack  range. \n7.  (a)  Implementation  Schedule \nFWCS  will  fully  implement  this  Decree  including \nif necessary  the  obligatory back-up  provision  of \nsection  3,  by  the  commencement  of  the  1991-92 \nschool  year,  as  follows: \nFall  1988: \nMAP  1.  Croninger  and  Young  converted  to magnet \nschools;  magnet  programs  instituted at Waynedale \nand  Franke  Parke;  Memorial  Park  closed. \nFall  1989: \nMAP  2.  Irwin  converted  to magnet  school,  and \nmagnet  programs  instituted at  Price,  Holland  and \nWashington  Center  schools. \n11 \n\nFall  1990: \nMap  3.  Bunche  or Ward  converted  to  a  magnet \nschool,  and  three magnet  schools  or programs \ninstituted at predominantly  white  schools. \nFall  1991: \nMAP  4.  Remaining  predominantly  black  school, \n~ or  Bunche,  converted  to magnet  school,  and \nadditional  magnet  programs  instituted  at  remaining \npredominantly  white  schools,  as  necessary  to  meet \nthe  racial  balance  goals  specified  in  section  6. \n7.  (b)  Duration  of  Decree \nFrom  the  1991-92  school  year  when  the  plan  is \nfully  implemented  through  the  1996-97  school  year, \nFWCS  will  continue  to  meet  the  system-wide  racial \nbalance  standards  described  in  Section  6,  making \nany  annual  adjustments  in  student  assignments \nneeded  to maintain  the  standards.  The  mo~itor, \nappointed  pursuant  to  section  11,  will  continue  to \nperform  his  or her duties  until  the  conclusion  of \nthe  1996-97  school  year. \n12 \n\n7.  (c)  Duration  of  Obligation \nSubsequent  to  the  1996-97  school  year,  FWCS  will \nno  longer  be  required  to maintain  racial  balance \nratios  such  as  those  set  forth  in section  6  of \nthis  Decree  or to pursue  the methods  of  racial \nbalance  set  forth  in sections  3  and  7  of  the \nDecree;  provided,  however,  that  FWCS  will \ncontinue  to maintain  a  racially  integrated-school \nsystem.  All  decisions  involving  school  attendance \nareas,  programs,  staffing,  allocations  of \nresources,  school  buildings,  and  the  like,  will  be \ntaken  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the \nequal  protection  clauses  of  the united  states  and \nIndiana  constitutions  and  applicable  federal  and \nstate civil  rights  laws. \n8.  (a)  Isolation within  Schools \nThe  parties  recognize  the  importance  of  avoiding \nracial  isolation  in  classrooms  and  other \nfacilities within  the  schools.  To  this  end,  FWCS \nhas  agreed  to  the  15  percent  to  45  percent  racial \nbalance  range  described  in  Paragraph  6  which  will \nminimize  racial  isolation.  In  addition,  FWCS  will \navoid  procedures  or practices  which  result  in \nseparation of  students  by  race  within  school \nbuildings  for  any  significant portion  of  the \n13 \n\nschool  day.  Racial  isolation may  not  be  justified \nby  the  use  of  \"mental  ratings.\" \n8.  (b)  Socioeconomic  Isolation \nFWCS  acknowledges  the  importance  of  maintaining \nschools  with  a  reasonable  cross-section  of  student \nabilities and  achievement  levels  and,  in \nadministering  this  Decree,  the  methods  employed \nby  FWCS  to  achieve  racial  balance  under  Section \n2(a)  will  seek  to  attain  this  goal. \n9.  Inner-City  School  Clos ings \nFWCS  will  not  close  any  additional  schools  located \nin  inner-city  neighborhoods. \n10.  School  Environment \nThe  parties  recognize  the  need  for  the  creation \nand  maintenance  of  a  school  environment  that \nfacilitates  positive  interracial  contact  and  that \nfosters  respect  for  racial  and  ethnic  diversity \namong  students. \n10.  (a)  In-Service  Training \nFWCS  will  implement  an  in-service  training  program \nin  human  relations  for  teachers  and  other  staff \nwith  particular attention  to  the  needs  of  faculty \n14 \n\nand  staff currently  assigned  to  racially  isolated \nschools  t~at ~ill be  racially  balanced  as  a  result \nof  the  Decree.  FWCS  will  consult  with  the \nappropriate  teacher  and  employee  representative \norganizations  in developing  such  a  program. \n10.  (b)  orientation  Programs \norientation programs  and  other meetings  to  provide \nparents with  full  information  about  the  Decree \nwill  be  conducted  by  FWCS.  FWCS  will  also  develop \nprograms  to  facilitate  contact between  parents  of \nchildren  of  different  races  and  communities  who \nwill  attend  school  together  as  a  result  of  this \nDecree. \n10.  (c)  curriculum Review \nFWCS  will  continue  to  review  its curriculum  to \nassure  that curriculum materials  are  included \nwhich  foster  an  understanding  of  the  heritage  of \nall  racial  and  religious  groups. \n11.  (a)  Monitoring \nThis  Decree  will  be  monitored  by  a  person  agreed \nupon  by  FWCS  and  the  Plaintiffs  and  appointed  by \nthe  Court  concurrently with  the  entry  of  the \nconsent  decree.  If FWCS  and  the  Plaintiffs  fail \n15 \n\nto  agree  on  a  Monitor,  the  Monitor  will  be \nappointed. by  the  Court.  The  responsibility  of  the \nMonitor  will  be  to  report  at  least  annually  to  the \nCourt  and  to  the  parties  on  the  status of \nimplementation  of  the  Decree.  FWCS  will  make \navailable  to  the Monitor  and  to  the  Plaintiffs \ndata  relating to  implementation  of  all  provisions \nof  this  Decree  including but  not  limited  to  data \non  enrollment,  applicant  flow,  racial  composition \nof  classrooms,  and  discipline. \n11.  (b)  Community  Committee \nThe  Monitor  and  FWCS  will  provide  information \nto  any  community  group  or  committee  established \nto  promote  the  purposes  of  this  Decree  and  will \ncooperate with  such  group  or  committee. \n12.  Data  Access \nFWCS  will  provide  Plaintiffs with  access  to  data \n(including  but  not  limited  to  enrollment  and \ntransfer data  for  each  school)  that  will  enable \nPlaintiffs  to monitor  compliance  with  the  Decree. \n16 \n\n13.  Discipline \nFWCS  agrees  with  the  importance  of  fair, \nconsistent  and  effective  student  discipline \npolicies  and  practices.  FWCS  will  continue  to \nreview  its policies  and  practices  periodically \nto  assure  that they  meet  these  standards  and  are \nnon-discriminatory. \n14.  Educational  Improvements \nFWCS  will  develop  and  implement  a  program  of \neducational  improvements  that will  include  the \nfollowing  components: \n14.  (a)  FWCS  will  identify existing  resources: \n(i)  that  are  currently devoted  to \npreventive,  remedial  and  supplementary  education \nfor  students working  below  grade  level  or who  are \notherwise  at  risk of  educational  failure,  and \n(ii)  that  are  currently devoted  to  the \ncreation  and  maintenance  of  positive  interracial \nrelationships  of  the  kind  contemplated  by  (but  not \nlimited  to)  sections  10(a)  and  10Cb). \n17 \n\nExisting  resources  will  be  brought  together  in  a \nsingle  coordinated  program,  under  the  direction  of \na  central  office  administrator.  steps will  be \ntaken  to make  the  most  effective  and  efficient use \nof  existing  resources.  The  program  may  also \ninclude  the  assignment  to  existing building \npersonnel,  consistent  with  applicable  bargaining \nprocedures,  of  duties  and  responsibilities  to \nassist  in  the  effective  and  harmonious \nimplementation  of  this  program,  and  may  also \ninclude  the  recruitment  and  use  of  trained \nvolunteers. \n( \n14.  (b)  FWCS  and  Plaintiffs will  also  cooperate  with  one \nanother: \n(i)  to  identify,  determine  the  costs  of, \nand  prioritize additional  educational  improvement \nprograms  that would  require  funding  beyond  the \ncapacity  of  FWCS'  existing and  anticipated \nresources;  and \n(ii)  to  identify  sources  of  and  to  secure \nspecial  funding  commitments  from  organizations  and \ninstitutions  other  than  FWCS,  including  (but  not \nlimited  to)  grants,  agreements  to  underwrite \n18 \n\nspecific programs,  and  contributions  from \nindustry,. foundations,  and  other  sources;  and \n(iii)  to  secure  enactment  into  law  of  House \n. Bill  1131  which  provides  funding  for  magnet \nschools  and  other  educational  improvements  in \nschools.  Ten  percent  of  the  funds  authorized by \nHouse  Bill  1131  to  be  raised will  be  dedicated  by \nFWCS  to  educational  improvements  programs.  It is \ncurrently anticipated  that  this  10%  would  yield \napproximately  $300,000  annually  for  such \neducational  improvements.  In  the  event  that any \ngovernmental  body  designated  as  a  reviewing \nauthority under  HB  1131  reduces  a  request  made  by \nFWCS,  the  funds  earmarked  under  this  sUbsection \nwill  be  reduced  a  proportionate  amount  from  the \n10%  of  authorized  funding.  [Example:  HB  1131 \nauthorizes  levy  of  $0.25  per  $100  of  assessed \nvaluation which  will  yield  $3  million  or  $300,000 \nfor  educational  improvements  under  this \nsubsection.  FWCS  requests  a  levy  of  only  $0.15  of \nassessed valuation which  would  yield  $1.8  million, \nbut  still yield  $300,000  of  the  authorized  amount \nfor  educational  improvements  under  this \nsUbsection.  school  Property Tax  Control  Board \nreduces  FWCS  request  from  $0.15  to  $0.10  (by  one-\n19 \n\nthird).  Funds  available  under  sUbsection  would  be \n$200, 000, -i. e.  one-third  reduction  of  full \nauthorize9  amount.];  and \n(iv)  to  secure  appropriate  contributions \nfrom  the  state defendants  to  the  program  of \neducational  improvements;  and \n(v)  in  the  establishment  of  a  special \ncommittee  to which  FWCS  will  appoint  six  (6) \nmembers  and  Plaintiffs will  appoint  three  (3) \nmembers.  The  committee  will  consist  of  two \nadditional  members,  one  each  appointed  by  the \nFort  Wayne  Corporate  Council  and  by  the  Education \nCommittee  of  the  Greater  Fort  Wayne  Chamber  of \nCommerce.  The  purpose  of  the  special  committee \nwill  be  to  identify,  describe,  evaluate, \ndetermine  costs,  and  to  rank  in  order  of  priority, \naccording  to  the  availability  of\" fundin'g  programs \n\" \nand  services  that  are  designed  to  accomplish  the \npurposes  set out  in  sUbsection  (a);  and \n(vi)  to  jointly organize  and  recruit \neducation,  religious,  and  business  leaders  in  the \ncommunity  to  identify,  seek,  and  obtain  the \nspecial  funding  commitments  contemplated  by  this \n20 \n\nsubsection(b).  Such  funding  commitments  may  be  to \nunderwrit~ specific programs  or may  be  for \nspecific dollar grants  or  contributions,  and  may \nbe  for  a  multi-year  commitments.  All  funds \ncontributed shall  be  specifically  earmarked  for \nthe  educational  improvement  programs  contemplated \nby  this  section. \n14.  (c)  All  educational  improvements  developed  and \nimplemented  as  a  result  of  this  section will  be \nunder  the  administration  and  control  of  FWCS. \n14.  (d)  FWCS  will  regularly  make  reports  on  the \nprograms.and will  regularly  evaluate  the \nimprovements  brought  about. by,  and  the \neffectiveness of,  each  such  program. \n14.  (e)  The  f~nds made  available by  House  Bill  1131\" and \nearmarked under  subsection(Q) (iii)  of  this section \nto an  educational  improvement  program will  be  made \navailable beginning  in  the  1989-90  school  year  and \nwill  continue through  the  1996-97  school  year. \nSimilarly  the  funds  to  be  secured  from  the  state \n21 \n\ndefendants  under  subsection(b) (iv)  of  this  section \nwill  be  made  available  in  the  1989-90  school  year \nand  continue  through  the  1996-97  school  year. \n15.  cooperation  of  Parties,  Resolution  of  Issues, \nEnforcement  of  Decree \n15.  (a)  With  the  entry  of  a  consent  decree  this Action \nagainst  FWCS  is dismissed  with  prejudice.  The \nDecree  resolves  all  issues  in this Action  between \nFWCS  and  Plaintiffs relating  to  alleged  acts  and \npractices  by  FWCS,  the  Board  and  Superintendent \nat  any  time  prior to  the  date  of  the  Decree,  as \nwell  as  to  any  future  effects  of  such  acts/and \npractices. \n15.  (b)  Successful  performance  of  the  Decree  will  require \nthe  joint application  of  the  efforts  of  Plaintiffs \nand  FWCS  defendants.  To  that  end: \n(i)  Plaintiffs will  cooperate  with  FWCS \nin  implementing  all provisions  of  this  Decree, \nincluding  those  pertaining to magnet  schools  in \nsections  2,  5  and  7(a)  of  the  Decree  and  to  the \naffirma~ive marketing  of  the  benefits  of  magnets \nas  provided  for  in section  4. \n22 \n\n(ii)  If any  person  or  entity  seeks  in  a \nseparate  action  or proceeding  a  remedy  which  would \nbe  inconsistent with  the  relief  provided  in  this \nDecree,  FWCS  and  Plaintiffs will  take  any  steps \nneeded  to preserve  the  integrity of  the  Decree. \n(iii)  To  the  extent  that  interpretation \nof  provisions  of  this  Decree  becomes  necessary, \nFWCS  and  Plaintiffs will  seek  to  address  any \nissues  jointly and  in  a  cooperative  manner. \n23 \n\n",

BACKGROUND \n1.  Plaintiffs  initiated this  action  on  September  5, \n1986  when  they  filed  a  Complaint  alleging  that  defendants \nmaintained  an  unlawfully  segregated  school  system  and  demanding \ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief.  Specifically,  the  Complaint \nalleged  that  on  May  17,  1954,  defendants  operated  a  racially dual \npublic  school  system  in  Fort  Wayne,  Indiana.  The  Complaint \nfurther  alleged  that,  subsequent  to  May  17,  1954,  defendants \nfailed  to  dismantle  the  dual  system  and  acted  or  failed  to  act  in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  alleged  conditions  of  segregation  in  the  Fort \nWayne  public  schools  were  maintained  and  exacerbated.  The \n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 2 of 16\nComplaint  sought  a  judgment,  among  other  types  of  relief: \n{a)  declaring  that  defendants  and  their predecessors  \"created, \nmaintained,  and  continue  to  perpetuate  a  racially dual  structure \nof  public  education\"  in  violation  of  federal  and  state  law; \n(b)  enjoining  defendants  from  future  unlawful  conduct;  and  (c) \nrequiring  defendants  to  \"develop  and  implement  an  equitable  plan \nof  desegregation which  will  .  .  .  remove  all vestiges  of  prior \ndiscrimination  from  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools.\" \n2.  This  action was  brought  as  a  class  action  by  a \nnot-for-profit  corporation,  Parents  for  Quality Education  With \nIntegration,  Inc.,  .and  22  named  minor  plaintiffs  and  their \n---~ \nparents  (or  persons  standing  in  loco parentis),  on  their own \nbehalf  and  on  behalf  of  all  other  children and  their parents  who \ncurrently  attend  or  who  will  in  the  future  attend  the  public \nschools  of  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools  Corporation.  The  class \nwas  certified by  the  Court  on  November  15,  1988,  and  consists  of \ntwo  subclasses:  the  first  comprised  of  all  such  black  children \nand  their parents;  and  the  second  comprised  of  all  such  white \nchildren  and  their parents  (hereinafter  \"plaintiffs''). \n3.  Originally,  the  defendants  in  this  action \nconsisted of  two  groups:  (a)  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools \nCorporation,  its Superintendent  of  Schools,  and  individual \nmembers  of  its Board  of  School  Trustees  (collectively referred  to \nhereinafter  as  \"FWCS  Defendants\");  and  {b)  the  State  of  Indiana, \nthe  Governor  of  the  State  of  Indiana,  the  Attorney General  of  the \nState  of  Indiana,  the  State  Superintendent  of  Puolic  Instruction \n- 2  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 3 of 16\nof  the  State  of  Indiana  (who  also  serves  as  Chair  of  the  Indiana \nState  Board  of  Education),  members  of  the  Indiana  State  Board  of \nEducation,  and  the  Indiana  Department  of  Education  (collectively \nreferred  to  hereinafter  as  \"State Defendants'').  Following  a \nsettlement  between  plaintiffs  and  FWCS  Defendants,  and  a  fairness \nhearing  on  December  14,  1989,  the  Court  approved  the  settlement \nagreement  and  entered  it as  a  consent  decree  in  an  opinion \nreported  as  Parents  for  Qualitv Education  With  Integration,  Inc. \nv.  Fort  Wayne  Communitv  Schools  Corp.,  728  F.  Supp.  1373  (N.D. \nInd.  1990) .  All  claims  against  the  FWCS  Defendants  were \ndismissed  with  prejudice.  Thereafter,  plaintiffs  proceeded  on \ntheir  claims  against  State  Defendants. \n4.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction over  the  subject \nmatter  of  this  action  and  over  the  parties,  as  determined  by  the \nCourt's  June  22,  1987  order,  granting  in part  and  denying  in part \nthe  motion  of  State  Defendants  to  dismiss.  See  Parents  for \nQuality Education  With  Integration,  Inc.  v.  Fort  Wayne  Community \nSchools  Corp.,  662  F.  Supp.  1475  (N.D.  Ind.  1987).  Venue  is \nproper before  this  Court.  On  October  23,  1992,  the  United  States \nCourt  of  Appeals  for  the  Seventh Circuit  affirmed  the  district \ncourt's  denial  of  State  Defendants'  motion  for  summary  judgment \nand  held  that  plaintiffs'  suit  was  not  barred by  the  Eleventh \nAmendment.  Parents  for  Quality  Education  With  Education,  Inc.  v. \nIndiana,  977  F.2d  1207  (7th  Cir.  1992). \n5.  Plaintiffs  and  State  Defendants  have  conducted \nextensive  discovery,  including  numerous  interrogatories, \n- 3  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 4 of 16\ndocuments  requests,  requests  for  admission,  and  depositions.  In \naddition,  these  parties,  at  the  direction of  the  Court  and  with \nthe  guidance  of  Magistrate  Judge  Roger  Cosbey,  have  engaged  in  a \nlengthy  stipulation process.  The  FWCS  Defendants  participated in \nsimilar discovery  before  their  settlement  with plaintiffs  and \ntheir  resulting dismissal  from  this  case.  They  also  assisted  in \nthe  stipulation process  before  that  dismissal  and,  thereafter, \ncounsel  for  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools  Corporation  assisted \nplaintiffs  and  State  Defendants  with  that  process  at  the  Court's \nrequest. \n6.  The  parties  to  this  Consent  Decree  are  plaintiffs, \n.. · \nState  Defendants,  and,  only  for  purposes  of  ensuring  the \nperformance  of  the  obligations  stated  in paragraphs  12(c),  13  and \n15  of  this  Consent  Decree,  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools \nCorporation.  Through  a  combination  of  the  previous  settlement \nbetween  plaintiffs  and  FWCS  Defendants  and  the  settlement  between \nplaintiffs  and  State  Defendants,  as  reflected  in  this  Consent \nDecree·,  all  claims  in  this  case  (except  for  plaintiffs'  claims \nfor  attorneys'  fees  against  State  Defendants)  are  resolved  with \nthe  entry of  this  Consent  Decree. \n7.  At  the  direction of  the  Court  and  with  the \nassistance  of  Magistrate  Judge  Roger  Cosbey,  who  this  Court \nappointed  to  preside  over  settlement  negotiations,  the  parties  to \nthis  Consent  Decree  have  sought  to  reach  a  fair  and  equitable \nsettlement  of  their differences  and  to  avoid  the  divisiveness  and \ncost  of  litigating the  claims  asserted by  plaintiffs. \n- 4  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 5 of 16\n8.  On  February  5,  1994,  counsel  (through  Magistrate \nJudge  Cosbey)  notified  the  Court  of  a  possible  settlement  and  the \nCourt  thereafter  set  a  hearing  for  February  11,  1994.  At  the \nFebruary  11,  1994  hearing,  the  parties  notified the  Court  of  the \nterms  of  the  proposed  settlement,  submitted  those  terms  to  the \nCourt  in writing,  and  asked  that  the  Court  give  preliminary \napproval  to  the  proposed  settlement.  By  order  dated  February  24, \n1994,  the  Court  preliminarily approved  the  proposed  settlement. \nAt  the  hearing  on  February  11,  1994,  the  Court  also  directed  the \nparties  to  submit  a  proposed  form  of  notice  to  the  class  of \nplaintiffs  of  that  proposed  settlement,  present  a  tentative \nschedule  for  giving  such  notice,  and  suggest  a  schedule  for \nconducting  other  appropriate  proceedings  with  regard  to  the \nproposed  settlement.  On  March  18,  1994,  the  Court  issued  an \norder  setting a  hearing  on  the  fairness  and  adequacy  of  the \nproposed  settlement,  approved  the  proposed  notice  submitted  by \nthe  parties,  and  adopted  the  schedule  for  such  notice  and \nproceedings  that  the  parties  had  submitted  jointly on  March  11, \n1994.  By  an  order  dated  April  8,  1994,  the  Court  modified  the \ndate  for  publication  of  the  notice  to  the  Plaintiff  Class. \n9.  Pursuant  to  the  Court's  order  of  March  18,  1994, \nnotice  to  the  class  (attached  as  Exhibit  \"A\")  and  the  full  text \nof  the  proposed  settlement  agreement  were  published  in  the \nfollowing  newspapers  published  in the  Fort  Wayne  area:  The  News-\nSentinel  (April  2,  1994);  Frost  Illustrated  (April  6-12,  1994); \nand  The  Journal  Gazette  (April  4,  1994)  (attached  as  Exhibit \n- 5  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 6 of 16\n\"B\").  The  published  notice  set  forth  procedures  governing  the \nfiling  of  comments  with  the  Court  and  participation by  members  of \nthe  class  of  plaintiffs  and  the  public  in  the  May  17,  1994 \nhearing  on  the  fairness  and  adequacy  of  the  proposed  settlement, \nas  embodied  in  this  Consent  Decree.  In  addition,  the  Fort  Wayne \nCommunity  Schools  Corporation  cooperated  with  plaintiffs  by \nmaking  copies  of  the  currently proposed  settlement  and  the  1990 \nConsent  Decree  (embodying  the  terms  of  the  settlement  between \nplaintiffs  and  FWCS  Defendants)  available  for  inspection  during \nregular  school  hours  at  the  Lester  L.  Grile  Administrative  Center \nof  the  Fort  Wayne  Community  Schools  Corporation  and  in  the \nprincipal's  office  of  each  public  school  operated by  the  Fort \nWayne  Community  Schools  Corporation.  In  addition,  the  proposed \nsettlement  was  available  for  inspection  in  Fort  Wayne  at  the \nOffice  of  the  Clerk  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the \nNorthern  District  of  Indiana,  the  Old  Fort  YMCA  and  the  East \nWayne  Street  Center.  Plaintiffs  and  their  attorneys  also \nappeared  before  or  spoke  on  the  telephone  to  numerous  leaders  and \nofficials  of  area  civic,  religious,  and  business  organizations \nregarding  the  proposed  settlement,  including:  Arts  United; \nAssociated  Churches  of  Fort  Wayne  and  Allen  County;  The  Greater \nFort  Wayne  Chamber  of  Commerce;  The  Fort  Wayne  Journal-Gazette; \nIndiana/Purdue  University  at  Fort  Wayne;  Lincoln  National \nCorporation;  Lincoln  Life  Improved  Housing;  Fort  Wayne  branch  of \nthe  National  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Colored  People; \nNavistar  International;  FWCS  PTA  Council;  Southern  Heights \n- 6  -\n\ncase 1:86-cv-00325-AS-RBC   document 382   filed 05/17/94   page 7 of 16\nBaptist  Church;  Fort  Wayne  Urban  League;  and  the  office  of  Fort \nWayne  Mayor  Paul  Helmke. \n10.  On  May  17,  1994,  the  Court  convened  a  hearing  in \nFort  Wayne  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  fairness,  adequacy \nand  reasonableness  of  the  proposed  settlement  to  the  Plaintiff \nClass.

The suit also was brought against the State of Indiana, the Governor \nof the State of Indiana, the Attorney General of Indiana, the State Superintendent of \nPublic Instruction, the State Department of Education and the members of the State \nBoard of Education (State Defendants).  The complaint charged that the FWCS and \nState  Defendants  established  and  maintained  a  racially  segregated  public  school \nsystem.  The FWCS Defendants and State Defendants have denied liability. \nTHE 1990 SETTLEMENT WITH FORT WAYNE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS \nPlaintiffs'  claims against Fort Wayne Community Schools Defendants  were \nsettled by a consent decree entered by this Court on January 24, 1990. The Court's \ndecision approving that settlement is published under the following name and location: \nParents for Quality Education with Integration, Inc., et aI., v. Fort Wayne Community \nSchools Corporation,  et aI.,  728 F.  Supp.  1373 (N.D.  Ind.  1990). As part of that \nsettlement, FWCS agreed to and has racially balanced all FWCS elementary schools \nwithin a range of 10-50% black enrollment.  The settlement provided, among other \nthings, for magnet schools and programs and for programs to improve education for \nat-risk students.  The proposed Agreement now before the Court does not, except as \nset  forth  below,  alter  in  any  material  way  FWCS'  obligations  under  the  1990 \nsettlement. \nTHE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nThe proposed Agreement resolves all issues in this action between the Plaintiffs \nand the State Defendants, including all issues relating to alleged acts and practices of \ndiscrimination by the State Defendants at any time prior to the date of the Consent \nDecree  as well as any future effects of such acts and  practices. \n6 \n\nUpon approval of the Agreement and entry of the terms of that Agreement as \na Consent Decree by the Court, the Plaintiffs' claims against State Defendants shall \nbe dismissed with prejudice and all parties (including all members of the plaintiff class) \nwill be bound by the terms of the Agreement.  If the Agreement is not approved by \nthe Court, all parties will be bound by the outcome of future litigation in this case. \nThe full text of the proposed Agreement is as follows: \n[\"Settlement Agreement\" Attached] \n7 \n\nSEITLEMENT AGREEMENT \n1.

By the signature of this Agreement by its authorized representative, \nFWCS releases, acquits, and forever discharges State Defendants (and each of them) from all \n. claims, actions, causes of action, and liabilities which might have been asserted in any \nfashion arising out of the Litigation, whether by action for contribution, indemnification or \notherwise, based on or in any way relating to alleged racial segregation and discrimination in \n·61104 vI  -4-\n\nthe Fort Wayne Community Schools, any alleged past and future effects of alleged racial \n. segregation and discrimination in the Fort Wayne Community Schools, whether based on  II \naction or inaction at any time prior to the date of the consent decree, and any claims based \non or in any way relating to the costs incurred or actions undertaken by FWCS as a result of \nor in connection with the implementation of FWCS' settlements with the Office for Civil \nRights of the United States Department of Education and with plaintiffs in the Litigation, any \nconsent decrees relating to those settlements, the obligations which FWCS promises in this \nAgreement to peIform, or any other undertaking or cost incurred to alleviate alleged racial \nsegregation or racial imbalance in the Fort Wayne Community Schools.
