    "summary": "<p>On 9/12/1966, the plaintiffs brought this desegregation lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The plaintiffs, African-American minor school children, by and through their parents, sued the defendant Barbour County Board of Education to enjoin the operation of a segregated school system. They were represented by, among others, Jack Greenberg (for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund). </p><p>The plaintiffs requested admission to various schools in the district pursuant to a \"freedom of choice\" plan that the Board was operating. In 1965, the Board conceded that its school system violated the Constitution; it adopted the choice plan as part of its efforts to desegregate the school system beginning in the 1965-66 school year. The plaintiffs applied for admission to various schools for the 1966-67 school year but were denied because, according to the Board, their choices weren't \"practical\" given that school bus transportation -- which had been set up during the years that the district had operated in a segregated fashion -- was allegedly not available from the plaintiffs' homes. The court (Judge Frank Johnson) rejected the Board's arguments that it could not grant admission because of the transportation issue. In an order for preliminary injunction, he ordered the Board to revise its bus transportation system to accommodate all students' requests. He also ordered the Board to admit the plaintiffs in this case to their schools of choice and to provide them with transportation. Judge Johnson also laid the contours of what he deemed an appropriate school choice plan for the Board to implement, ordering that it begin with the fall 1967 term and apply to all grades in Barbour County, which, he ordered, must be desegregated. 259 F.Supp. 545 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 22, 1966).</p><p>On July 10, 1970, the district court approved a new desegregation plan, which stayed largely unchanged until the mid-1990s. At that point, the parties reviewed the Board's progress in desegregating and negotiated a new consent decree, approved on September 8, 1997. In that decree, the court found that the Board had achieved unitary status in facilities but not in any other area. </p><p>On September 8, 1997, the district court (Judge William Albritton) entered a new consent decree to govern the Board's desegregation efforts. </p><p>In 2000, the district court approved the consolidation of the high schools in Barbour County, and in 2004 it approved the consolidation and reorganization of the district's lower schools. </p><p>By the late 2000s, the lawsuit reached its conclusion. In 2007, the parties negotiated another consent decree, their last, which the court subsequently approved. At the end of that decree, in 2011, no party moved for an extension of the court's jurisdiction. And on April 18, 2013, the court declared that the Board had met the requirements for a declaration of unitary status and dismissed the case. </p><p><u>Available Opinions</u></p><p><i>Franklin v. Barbour County Board of Education</i>, 259 F.Supp. 545 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 22, 1966) </p>",

The Board provided the requested information and\nhas also provided information in response to the United States' subsequent requests for\ninformation. Upon analysis of the information and data provided by Board, the United States\ninformed the Board and private Plaintiffs that, in its view, the Board has fulfilled its affirmative\ndesegregation obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable federal law, entitling\nit to a declaration of unitary status. As indicated by the signatures of  Amicus Curiae United\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 2 of 6\nStates, private Plaintiffs, and Defendant Barbour County Board of Education below, the parties\nrespectfully request that the Court approve this Agreed Order of Unitary Status and Dismissal\nand terminate jurisdiction over this case.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn July 10, 1970, the Court approved a desegregation plan for the Barbour County\nSchool District and ordered the Board to implement said plan. In the mid-1990s, with aid of the\nCourt, the parties reviewed the Board's progress in desegregating the District and negotiated a\nconsent decree which the Court approved on September 8, 1997. In the 1997 Consent Decree,\nthe Court concluded that the Board had achieved unitary status in the area of facilities but found\nthat the Board had not yet achieved unitary status in the areas of student assignment,\ntransportation, faculty and support staff assignment, extracurricular activities, quality of\neducation, special education, and student discipline. The 1997 Consent Decree included a plan\nthat directed the Board to take action in these remaining areas to address non-compliance.\nIn 2000, the Court approved consolidation of the high schools in the District. Order,\nSept. 8, 2000, ECF No. 181. In 2004, the Court approved the consolidation and reconfiguration\nof K-8 schools in the District. Order, Jan. 27, 2004, ECF No. 200. The combined result of the\n2000 and 2004 orders is a single-grade configuration school system where every child enrolled\nin a particular grade in the District is assigned to the same school.\nIn 2007, the parties negotiated and the Court approved another consent decree in the case.\nThat consent decree placed limits on inter-district transfers between the District and Dale County\nSchool District. Order, May 10, 2007, ECF No. 223. The Dale County Board of Education was\njoined as a party to this matter for the limited purpose of enforcing the 2007 Consent Decree.\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 3 of 6\nThe 2007 Consent Decree expired October 1, 2011, and none of the parties moved for\nextension.\nSTIPULATED FACTS\nA.\t Student Assignment\n_Y^k For the 2012-13 school year, the District had approximatelyLW students enrolled in\nthe following schools:\nSchool\t Black\t White\t Other\t Total\nBarbour County Primary School\t 216\t 27\t 39\t 262\nBarbour County Intermediate School\t 239\t 28\t 32\t 240\nBarbour County 44iddi\t nQ0_\t 13\t 4\t 220\nBarbour County High School\t 223\t 15\t 3\t 320\nTotal\t 878(85%) 83(8%)\t 78(7%)\t 1039\nAs discussed, supra, the Board operates a single-grade configuration school system.\nEvery student in grades K-2 attends Barbour County Primary School, every student in grades\n3-6 attends Barbour County Intermediate School, every student in grades 7-9 attends Barbour\nCounty Junior High, and every student in grades 10-12 attends Barbour County High School.'\nAdditionally, from 2007 to 2011, the Board complied in good faith with the 2007 Consent\nDecree to limit inter-district transfers that were impeding desegregation in the District.\n'This is a new grade configuration for the 2012-13 school year. Previously, the District used a slightly different\nconfiguration: Barbour County Primary School (K-2); Barbour County Intermediate School (3-5); Barbour County\nMiddle School (6-8 ); and Barbour County High School (9-12).\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 4 of 6\nB. Faculty and Staff Assignment\nFor the 2012-13 school year, the Board employs 84 teachers of whom 50 (60%) are\nblack and 34 (40%) are white. Half of the administrators in the District are white and half are\nblack. The Board employs 47 staff members of whom 33 (70%) are black and 13 (28%) are\nwhite and one is Hispanic. No school is racially identifiable on the basis of faculty or staff\nassignment.\nC. Transportation\nThere is no evidence indicating that the Board fails to equitably provide bus\ntransportation to all students in the District.\nD. Extracurricular Activities\nThere is no evidence indicating that the Board offers its extracurricular activities on a\ndiscriminatory basis.\nE. Quality of Education, Special Education, and Student Discipline\nThere is no evidence indicating that the Board places students in special education or\nadvanced programs in a discriminatory manner. Rather, enrollment in these programs reflects\nthe overall enrollment in the District. According to 2012-13 data, the gifted and talented\nprogram enrolled 15 students of whom all are black. Similarly, for the 29 honors and Advanced\nPlacement courses offered, class enrollment is above 80% black. Likewise, 133 black, 16 white,\nand 1 Hispanic student were identified for special education services. Finally, there is no\nevidence that the Board discriminates in its administration of discipline.\nDISCUSSION\n\"The duty and responsibility of a school district once segregated by law is to take all\nsteps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of the unconstitutional dejure system.\" Freeman v,\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 5 of 6\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 485 (1992). When evaluating whether a school district has eliminated the\nvestiges of the dual system, a court considers \"whether the Board ha[s] complied in good faith\nwith the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past\ndiscrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\"  Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City Pub.\nSch. v. Dowel!, 498 U.S. 237, 249-50 (1991); see also Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 89\n(1995); Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491-92.\nWhen assessing whether a school district has achieved such compliance, a court\nevaluates all facets of a school district's operations. See Green v. CnIy, Sch. Bd. of New Kent\nCnty., 391 U.S. 430, 442 (1968). These are commonly referred to as the \"Green factors\" which\ninclude student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. at 88; Dowel!, 498 U.S. at 250. However, these factors are not meant to\nimpose a \"rigid framework,\" and a court may consider additional issues such as quality of\neducation in the district. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.\nBased on the information and data provided by the Board, and on all the surrounding\nfacts, the Board has complied with the Court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period of\ntime and has eliminated the vestiges of past dejure discrimination to the extent practicable in the\nareas of student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, special\neducation, student discipline, and quality of education.\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 6 of 6\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court concludes that the Barbour County School Board has met the legal standards\nfor a declaration of unitary status, and that it is entitled to dismissal of this action. In addition,\nall claims and parties, including the Dale County Board of Education and the claims against it,\nare dismissed.\nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that all prior injunctions in this case are\nDISSOLVED, jurisdiction is TERMINATED, and this case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\nENTERED THIS /' '79.DAY OF \t 2013.\nSTATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267-1   Filed 04/18/13   Page 1 of 2\nA copy of this checklist is available at the website for the USCA, 11th Circuit at www.ca11.uscourts.gov\nEffective on April 9, 2006, the new fee to file an appeal will increase from $255.00 to $455.00.\nCIVIL APPEALS JURISDICTION CHECKLIST\n1.

A final decision is one that “ends the litigation on the merits and leaves\nnothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.” Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre,\n701 F.2d 1 365, 1 368 ( 11th Ci r. 1 983). A magistrate judge’s report and\nrecommendation is not final and appealable until judgment thereon is entered by a\ndistrict court judge. 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n(b)  In cases involving multiple parties or multiple claims, a judgment as to fewer than\nall parties or all claims is not a final, appealable decision unless the district court has\ncertified the judgment for immediate review under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).

THE NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED AND\nFILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT NO LATER THAN THE LAST DAY OF\nTHE APPEAL PERIOD – no additional days are provided for mailing. Special\nfiling provisions for inmates are discussed below.\n(b)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(3): “If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party\nmay file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was\nfiled, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period\nends later.”\n(c)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4): If any party makes a timely motion in the district court under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a type specified in this rule, the time for\nappeal for all parties runs from the date of entry of the order disposing of the last\nsuch timely filed motion.\n(d)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) and 4(a)(6): Under certain limited circumstances, the district\ncourt may extend the time to file a notice of appeal.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis cause is before the court on a Motion for Approval of Collateral Effect on \nAttendance Zones filed by the Barbour County Board of Education on August 4, 2000 (Doc. \n#165), and on a Motion to Substitute an Affidavit filed by the Barbour County Board of \nEducation on August 10, 2000 (Doc. #173). \nThis case was originally filed in 1966, and resuited in an Order setting forth steps to be \ntaken in order to racially desegregate the Barbour County school system.  In 1997, a Consent \nDecree was entered by this court, declaring that the facilities in the Barbour County school \nsystem were unitary, and outlining actions to be taken to make the school system unitary in all \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 181   Filed 09/08/00   Page 2 of 7\nother aspects.  At the time of the Consent Decree, there were two high schools in the Barbour \nCounty school system: Louisville High School and Clayton High School.  The Consent Decree \nindicates that at that time the racial composition of Louisville High School was 83% black, and \nthat the racial composition of Clayton High School was 99% black. \nOn June 26, 2000, with the agreement of the private Plaintiffs in this case and the United \nStates, the Barbour County Board of Education (\"the Board\") voted to close Louisville High \nSchool.  Closure of Louisville High School means that the students who would have attended \nthat school must attend school at a consolidated facility at the site of the former Clayton High \nSchool, which has been renamed \"Barbour County High School.\" \nOn August 10, 2000, this court conducted a hearing during which it listened to extensive \nargument on a Motion to Intervene to oppose consolidation of the schools.  Although the court \ndenied the Motion to Intervene, the court stated at the hearing on the Motion to Intervene that it \nwould consider all of the evidence submitted by the applicants for intervention in deciding the \nmerits of the Motion for Approval of the Collateral Effect on Attendance Zones (\"the Board's \nmotion\"), and gave the applicants for intervention permission to state their position on the \nBoard's motion in an amicus curiae brief.  The court also ordered that the United States, the \nprivate Plaintiffs, and the Board submit briefs discussing their positions on the Board's motion. \nBased on all of the arguments and evidence submitted to the court, the court concludes \nthat the Board's motion is due to be GRANTED. \nII. DISCUSSION \nThe closure of Louisville High School and consolidation with the former Clayton High \nSchool at the new Barbour County High School requires a modification of the consent decree \n2 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 181   Filed 09/08/00   Page 3 of 7\ngoverning the Barbour County school system. In Rufo v. Inmatus of Suffolk County Jail, 502 \nU.S. 367 (1992), the Supreme Court articulated a two-pronged approach to determining when \ncourts may approve a modification of a consent decree in an institutional-reform case. The first \nprong requires that the party seeking modification of the consent decree \"establish that a \nsignificant change in facts or law warrants revision ofthe decree.\" Id. at 760; see also Ensley \nBranch. NAACP v. Seibels, 31 F.3d 1548, 1563 (11th Cir.1994).  If the moving party satisfies \nthe changed-circumstances requirement, the second prong requires that the modifications be \n\"suitably tailored\" to address the new factual or legal environment. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 393.1 The \nRufo court enumerated three situations in which modification of a consent decree for a change in \nfacts may be warranted: (1) when changed factual conditions make compliance with the decree \nsubstantially more onerous, (2) when a decree proves to be unworkable because of unforeseen \nobstacles, or (3) when enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to \nthe public interest. Id. at 384-85. \nDuring the hearing on the Motion to Intervene, attorneys for the United States, the private \nplaintiffs, and the Alabama State Department of Education, which is not a party in this case, all \nrepresented to the court that they did not object to the consolidation of Louisville and Clayton \nHigh Schools.  In response to this court's Order, the United States has filed a brief in which it \nstates that in June of 2000, counsel for the Board consulted with the United States and the private \nPlaintiffs regarding the possibility of consolidating Louisville and Clayton High Schools.  The \nUnited States represents in its brief that it agreed at that time that consolidation would likely \n1 This standard has been relied upon in the submissions made to the court.  Assuming that \nthis is the correct standard to be applied, even though all of the parties in this lawsuit have agreed \nto the change in the consent decree at issue, as will be discussed, the court finds that this standard \nhas been met in this case. \n3 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 181   Filed 09/08/00   Page 4 of 7\nfurther the orderly desegregation of the Barbour County school system.  United States' Brief, \npage 2. The private Plaintiffs have also filed a brief in which they state that they do not object to \nthe consolidation of the high schools. The private Plaintiffs express some concern about what \nthey characterize as \"emotional issues\" regarding the closure of Louisville High School, but \nagree that consolidation is a move toward desegregation.  Plaintiffs brief, page 6. For that \nreason, the private Plaintiffs do not object to consolidation. \nIn reviewing the submissions made to this court, the court first notes that the so-called \n\"emotional issues\" of, for example, the length oftime children will spend on a bus to get to the \nnew consolidated high school, are real issues to all ofthose involved.  The role of this federal \ncourt, however, is limited to determining whether modification of the consent decree in the \nmanner requested by the local school board is needed to foster a unitary school system. In so \ndetermining, the court bears in mind the non-exclusive factors for evaluating unitary status which \nhave been identified by the Supreme Court: facilities, student assignments, faculty assignments, \nstaff assignments, transportation, and extracurricular activities, as well as quality of education. \nSee Green v. New Kent County School Board, 391 U.S. 430 (1968); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. \n467, 492 (1992). \nThe Board has stated to the court that the total high school enrollment in Barbour County \nhas been decreasing over time, resulting in two schools which are uneconomically small.  The \nBoard states that replacing those schools with a single school serves the purpose ofpromoting \ndesegregation and allows the one school to operate economically and to provide a higher quality \nof education. \nThe amicus curiae brief which has been filed expresses the concern that the consolidation \nof the schools will not foster desegregation, but will in fact promote segregation and will result in \n4 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 181   Filed 09/08/00   Page 5 of 7\na single high school which is 100% African American.  The amicus curiae brief predicts that all \nof the twenty white students who were formerly enrolled at Louisville High School will seek \neducation in places outside of the public school system in Barbour County.  According to the \nsubmissions of the Board, however, this prediction has not been borne out.  According to the \nBoard's representations, which is not contradicted by any evidence ofwhich the court is aware, \nthe current enrollment at the consolidated Barbour County High School consists of 408 black \nstudents and seventeen white students.2  According to these representations, therefore, the \nconsolidated high school population continues to consist ofboth black and white students. While \nthe white students are in the minority, they were in the minority at both of the high schools \nbefore the consolidation as well. \nThe court determines that the proposed consolidation is warranted because enforcement \nof the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest in a unitary school \nsystem.  Continuation of a system of two schools would not allow for the same steps toward \nunitary status on the Green factors to be taken because such steps would not have been feasible in \nthe two uneconomically small schools.  In the consolidated school, however, as expressed in the \nbriefs of the Board and the United States, consolidation will promote quality of education by \nallowing, for example, access to extracurricular activities.  The court further finds that \nconsolidation of the two schools into one high school is sufficiently tailored to meet the public \ninterest.  Consolidation of the two schools promotes, and does not impede, desegregation and \nhelps to ensure that there is not a return to segregated schools.  Further, as the United States \n2  According to the Board, at the end of the 1999-2000 school year, there were 20 white \nstudents enrolled at Louisville High School and 5 white students enrolled at Clayton High \nSchool. \n5 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 181   Filed 09/08/00   Page 6 of 7\npoints out, the burden of desegregation, in the form of transportation to the new consolidated \nschool, is not inequitably distributed since the racial compositions ofboth of the previous two \nhigh schools was majority African American. \nFederal courts have long-recognized that the closing of a school is an important and \ncomplex function of a local school board.  See United States v. Hendry County School District, \n504 F.2d 550, 553 (51h Cir. 1974).3  \"It is doubtful if any board anywhere has ever devised a plan \nthat closed some schools, expanded others, and changed boundary lines, that did not cause \ndissension and complaints.\" Adams v. Board ofPublic Education, 770 F.2d 1562 (11th Cir. \n1985).  In this case, the Board has made a difficult decision to close a school and, in doing so, \nhas satisfied its affirmative duty to not only avoid any official action that has the effect of \nperpetuating or reestablishing a dual school system, but also to render decisions that further \ndesegregation and help to eliminate the effects of the previous dual school system. See Harris v. \nCrenshaw Co. Bd. of Educ., 968 F .2d 1090, 1095 (11th Cir. 1992).  The Board is to be \ncommended for making a difficult decision which serves as a substantial step toward achieving \nthe public interest in a completely unitary school system. \nIII.

The Court ordered Barbour County to desegregate and required the District to\ntake steps to disestablish the dual system, including limiting the number of students residing in\nBarbour but attending school outside of the District.  According to the order, Barbour County,\n“shall not consent to transfers where the cumulative effect will reduce desegregation in either\ndistrict or reinforce a dual system.” 7/10/1970 Order at 6.\nOn May 23, 1992, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”)\nreceived complaints from parents that Barbour operated its intra- and inter-district transfer\nprogram in a manner that impeded the desegregation process.  See 9/8/1997 Order at 4.  On\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 223   Filed 05/10/07   Page 2 of 9\nSeptember 8, 1997, the Court approved a consent order in which the parties acknowledged\ncontinuing problems with both inter- and intra-district transfers raised in the OCR complaint. \nThe 1970 transfer provision was left intact and the Board was required to “strictly and\naffirmatively enforce its attendance zones.”  9/8/1997 Order at 4, 11.  In 2000, the Court issued\nan order to consolidate the high schools in the Barbour County School District in furtherance of\nthe desegregation process.  See 9/8/2000 Order at 4-5 (concluding that school consolidation will\nfurther desegregation because white students residing in Barbour County will not “seek\neducation in places outside of the public school system”). \nAt the Court’s request, in May 2005, the United States initiated a review of Barbour\nCounty School District’s (“Barbour” or “District”) loss of white student population through\nunauthorized inter-district transfers to Dale County, a school district adjacent to Barbour County. \nThis review revealed that, for the 2004-2005 school year, approximately 168 students, of whom\n78% were white, were residing in Barbour County yet attending school in Dale County,\nimpeding Barbour’s ability to comply with this Court’s July 10, 1970 and September 8, 1997\norders and frustrating the goals of the 2000 order.  In accordance with this Court’s direction, the\nparties engaged in good faith negotiations and voluntarily agreed, as indicated by the signatures\nbelow, to enter into this Consent Order, subject to the Court’s approval. \nOn May 10, 2007, this Court granted a Joint Motion to Join the Dale County Board of\nEducation as a Defendant Under Rule 19(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the\nlimited purpose of enforcing the 2007 Consent Order.\nAfter reviewing the terms of the Consent Order, this Court concludes that the entry of the\nConsent Order is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United\nStates of America and federal law, and that its entry will further the orderly desegregation of the\n2\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 223   Filed 05/10/07   Page 3 of 9\nBarbour County School District and is likely to bring about the creation of a unitary school\ndistrict and the termination of judicial supervision. \nTherefore, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED as follows: \nI.  DALE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nA. The Dale County School District shall not accept inter-district transfer students,\ndefined as students who reside in Barbour County but request to attend school in Dale County,\nwith the following exceptions: \n1.

The Board provided the requested information and\nhas also provided information in response to the United States' subsequent requests for\ninformation.

In the mid-1990s, with aid of the\nCourt, the parties reviewed the Board's progress in desegregating the District and negotiated a\nconsent decree which the Court approved on September 8, 1997. In the 1997 Consent Decree,\nthe Court concluded that the Board had achieved unitary status in the area of facilities but found\nthat the Board had not yet achieved unitary status in the areas of student assignment,\ntransportation, faculty and support staff assignment, extracurricular activities, quality of\neducation, special education, and student discipline. The 1997 Consent Decree included a plan\nthat directed the Board to take action in these remaining areas to address non-compliance.\nIn 2000, the Court approved consolidation of the high schools in the District. Order,\nSept. 8, 2000, ECF No. 181. In 2004, the Court approved the consolidation and reconfiguration\nof K-8 schools in the District. Order, Jan. 27, 2004, ECF No. 200. The combined result of the\n2000 and 2004 orders is a single-grade configuration school system where every child enrolled\nin a particular grade in the District is assigned to the same school.\nIn 2007, the parties negotiated and the Court approved another consent decree in the case.\nThat consent decree placed limits on inter-district transfers between the District and Dale County\nSchool District. Order, May 10, 2007, ECF No. 223. The Dale County Board of Education was\njoined as a party to this matter for the limited purpose of enforcing the 2007 Consent Decree.\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 3 of 6\nThe 2007 Consent Decree expired October 1, 2011, and none of the parties moved for\nextension.\nSTIPULATED FACTS\nA. Student Assignment\nFor the 2012-13 school year, the District had approximatelyLW students enrolled in\n_Y^k \nthe following schools:\nSchool  Black White Other Total\nBarbour County Primary School 216 27 39 262\nBarbour County Intermediate School 239 28 32 240\n13 4 220\nBarbour County 44iddi \nnQ0_ \nBarbour County High School  223 15 3  320\nTotal  878(85%) 83(8%) 78(7%) 1039\nAs discussed, supra, the Board operates a single-grade configuration school system.\nEvery student in grades K-2 attends Barbour County Primary School, every student in grades\n3-6 attends Barbour County Intermediate School, every student in grades 7-9 attends Barbour\nCounty Junior High, and every student in grades 10-12 attends Barbour County High School.'\nAdditionally, from 2007 to 2011, the Board complied in good faith with the 2007 Consent\nDecree to limit inter-district transfers that were impeding desegregation in the District.\n'This is a new grade configuration for the 2012-13 school year. Previously, the District used a slightly different\nconfiguration: Barbour County Primary School (K-2); Barbour County Intermediate School (3-5); Barbour County\nMiddle School (6-8 ); and Barbour County High School (9-12).\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 4 of 6\nB. Faculty and Staff Assignment\nFor the 2012-13 school year, the Board employs 84 teachers of whom 50 (60%) are\nblack and 34 (40%) are white. Half of the administrators in the District are white and half are\nblack. The Board employs 47 staff members of whom 33 (70%) are black and 13 (28%) are\nwhite and one is Hispanic. No school is racially identifiable on the basis of faculty or staff\nassignment.\nC. Transportation\nThere is no evidence indicating that the Board fails to equitably provide bus\ntransportation to all students in the District.\nD. Extracurricular Activities\nThere is no evidence indicating that the Board offers its extracurricular activities on a\ndiscriminatory basis.\nE. Quality of Education, Special Education, and Student Discipline\nThere is no evidence indicating that the Board places students in special education or\nadvanced programs in a discriminatory manner. Rather, enrollment in these programs reflects\nthe overall enrollment in the District. According to 2012-13 data, the gifted and talented\nprogram enrolled 15 students of whom all are black. Similarly, for the 29 honors and Advanced\nPlacement courses offered, class enrollment is above 80% black. Likewise, 133 black, 16 white,\nand 1 Hispanic student were identified for special education services. Finally, there is no\nevidence that the Board discriminates in its administration of discipline.\nDISCUSSION\n\"The duty and responsibility of a school district once segregated by law is to take all\nsteps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of the unconstitutional dejure system.\" Freeman v,\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 5 of 6\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 485 (1992). When evaluating whether a school district has eliminated the\nvestiges of the dual system, a court considers \"whether the Board ha[s] complied in good faith\nwith the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past\ndiscrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City Pub.\nSch. v. Dowel!, 498 U.S. 237, 249-50 (1991); see also Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 89\n(1995); Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491-92.\nWhen assessing whether a school district has achieved such compliance, a court\nevaluates all facets of a school district's operations. See Green v. CnIy, Sch. Bd. of New Kent\nCnty., 391 U.S. 430, 442 (1968). These are commonly referred to as the \"Green factors\" which\ninclude student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. at 88; Dowel!, 498 U.S. at 250. However, these factors are not meant to\nimpose a \"rigid framework,\" and a court may consider additional issues such as quality of\neducation in the district. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.\nBased on the information and data provided by the Board, and on all the surrounding\nfacts, the Board has complied with the Court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period of\ntime and has eliminated the vestiges of past dejure discrimination to the extent practicable in the\nareas of student assignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, special\neducation, student discipline, and quality of education.\n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 267   Filed 04/18/13   Page 6 of 6\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court concludes that the Barbour County School Board has met the legal standards\nfor a declaration of unitary status, and that it is entitled to dismissal of this action.

Appealable Orders: Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction conferred and strictly limited by\nstatute:\n(a)  Appeals from final orders pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291: Only final orders and\njudgments of district courts, or final orders of bankruptcy courts which have been\nappealed to and fully resolved by a district court under 28 U.S.C.§ 158, generally are\nappealable. A final decision is one that “ends the litigation on the merits and leaves\nnothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.” Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre,\n701 F.2d 1 365, 1 368 ( 11th Ci r. 1 983).

Time for Filing: The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.\nRinaldo v. Corbett, 256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001). In civil cases, Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)\nand (c) set the following time limits:\n(a)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1): A notice of appeal in compliance with the requirements set\nforth in Fed.R.App.P. 3 must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the\nentry of the order or judgment appealed from. However, if the United States or an\nofficer or agency thereof is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed in the district\ncourt within 60 days after such entry. THE NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED AND\nFILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT NO LATER THAN THE LAST DAY OF\nTHE APPEAL PERIOD – no additional days are provided for mailing. Special\nfiling provisions for inmates are discussed below.\n(b)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(3): “If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party\nmay file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was\nfiled, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period\nends later.”\n(c)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4): If any party makes a timely motion in the district court under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a type specified in this rule, the time for\nappeal for all parties runs from the date of entry of the order disposing of the last\nsuch timely filed motion.\n(d)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) and 4(a)(6): Under certain limited circumstances, the district\ncourt may extend the time to file a notice of appeal. Under Rule 4(a)(5), the time may\nbe extended if a motion for an extension is filed within 30 days after expiration of the\ntime otherwise provided to file a notice of appeal, upon a showing of excusable\nneglect or good cause. Under Rule 4(a)(6), the time may be extended if the district\ncourt finds upon motion that a party did not timely receive notice of the entry of the\njudgment or order, and that no party would be prejudiced by an extension.\n(e)  Fed.R.App.P. 4(c): If an inmate confined to an institution files a notice of appeal in\neither a civil case or a criminal case, the notice of appeal is timely if it is deposited in\nthe institution’s internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. Timely filing\nmay be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 or a notarized\nstatement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class\npostage has been prepaid.\n3.  Format of the notice of appeal: Form 1, Appendix of Forms to the Federal Rules of\nAppellate Procedure, is a suitable format. See also Fed.R.App.P. 3(c). A pro se notice of\nappeal must be signed by the appellant.\n4.  Effect of a notice of appeal: A district court loses jurisdiction (authority) to act after the\nfiling of a timely notice of appeal, except for actions in aid of appellate jurisdiction or to rule\non a timely motion of the type specified in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).",

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis cause is before the court on a Motion to Intervene filed by Sherry Lane Carpenter; \nEvell Robinson; Ida B. Herring; Chamese Herring, by Ida Herring; Kevin Christopher; Martin \nChristopher by Kevin Christopher; and the Town of Louisville, Alabama on August 3, 2000. \nIn setting forth the relevant facts, for purposes of deciding the motion to intervene, the \ncourt accepts the nonconclusory allegations of the applicants for intervention. See Lake Investors \nDevelopment Group. Inc. v. EGIDI Development Group, 715 F.2d 1256 (7th Cir. 1983). \nThis case was originally filed in 1966 and resulted in an Order setting forth steps to be \ntaken to desegregate the Barbour County school system.  In 1997, a Consent Decree was entered \n,. \n_g..~ ..l.. .t. _t __ \nEO D \nou_· \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 174   Filed 08/14/00   Page 2 of 8\nby this court, declaring that the facilities were unitary, and outlining actions to be taken to make \nthe entire school system unitary.  At the time of this Consent Decree, there were two high \nschools: Louisville High School and Clayton High School.  The Consent Decree indicates that \nthe racial composition of Louisville High School is 83% black and that the racial composition of \nClayton High School is 99% black. \nOn June 26, 2000, with the agreement of the Plaintiffs in this case and the United States, \nthe Barbour County Board of Education voted to close Louisville High School.  Closure of \nLouisville High School means that the students who would have attended that school must now \nattend Clayton High School, which is being renamed \"Barbour County High School.\". \nThe applicants for intervention consist of the following: Sherry Lane Carpenter and Evell \nRobinson, who are staff members who have been notified that they will not be employed during \nthe 2000/2001 school year; the parents ofChamese Herring and Martin Christopher, who are \nstudents who live in Louisville and who will have to attend Barbour County High School in \nClayton; and the Town ofLouisville. \nOn August 10, 2000, this court conducted a hearing during which it listened to extensive \nargument on the Motion to Intervene.  Based on all of the briefs and evidence submitted to the \ncourt, and the oral arguments of the parties and the applicants for intervention, and for the \nreasons to be discussed below, the Motion to Intervene is due to be DENIED. \nII. DISCUSSION \nIntervention of right is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a).  Rule 24(a) \nallows a third party to intervene as a matter of right if four requirements are met: (1) the \napplication to intervene is timely; (2) the applicant has an interest relating to the property or \n2 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 174   Filed 08/14/00   Page 3 of 8\ntransaction which is the subject of the action; (3) the applicant is so situated that disposition of \nthe action, as a practical matter, may impede or impair his ability to protect that interest; and ( 4) \nthe applicant must demonstrate that his interest is inadequately represented by existing parties to \nthe suit. Purcell v. BankAtlantic Financial Corporation, 85 F.3d 1508 (11th Cir. 1996). Ifthere is \nno right to intervene under Rule 24(a), it is wholly discretionary with the court whether to allow \nintervention under Rule 24(b).  Purcell, 85 F.3d at 1513. \nIt has long been recognized that parents have an intense interest in the education of their \nchildren.  Graves v. Walton County Bd. ofEduc., 686 F.2d 1135 {51 Cir. 1982).1  The interest \nh \nwhich must be demonstrated for persons to be entitled to intervention as of right in a school \ndesegregation case, however, is an interest in a desegregated school system. United States v. \nPerry Bd. of Ed., 567 F.2d 277 (5th Cir. 1978).  It is with the focus upon an interest in a \ndesegregated school system, therefore, that the court will first analyze the asserted interests of the \napplicants for intervention in this case. \nThe court begins with the Town of Louisville. In the Motion to Intervene, the applicants \nfor intervention state that the Town of Louisville will be injured by consolidation of the schools \nbecause ofthe adverse effect on the economy of Louisville, the adverse effect on community \nspirit and pride, the adverse impact on the academic performance of the children, and a greater \nrisk of danger or injury to the children.  These interests, however, are not interests in the \ndesegregation of the school system, which is the only interest over which this federal court \nexercises its jurisdiction.  The Town of Louisville's apparent political disagreement with the \n1 In Bonner v. City ofPrichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en bane), the \nEleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed \ndown prior to October 1, 1981. \n3 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 174   Filed 08/14/00   Page 4 of 8\nBarbour County Board of Education is not a legally cognizable interest in this desegregation \nlawsuit that will allow for intervention as of right.  See United States v. State of Georgia, 19 F.3d \n1388 (11th Cir. 1994).  Accordingly, this applicant for intervention has not demonstrated a legally \ncognizable right sufficient to entitle it to intervention as of right. \nApplicants for intervention Sherry Lane Carpenter and Evell Robinson are staff members \nwho are no longer employed with the Barbour County Board of Education.  Apparently, their \nonly stated interest is in their continued employment.  Such an interest in not an interest in the \ndesegregation of the school system. Accordingly, these applicants for intervention have not \ndemonstrated that they are entitled to intervention as of right. \nThe remaining applicants for intervention are the parents of a black and a white student \nwho would have attended Louisville High School.  At the hearing held on the Motion to \nIntervene, attorneys for the applicants for intervention stated that the interests of the black and \nwhite applicants for intervention are the same:  ensuring the desegregation of the school system. \nThey argue that the decision to close Louisville High School and to consolidate it with Clayton \nHigh School does not serve the purpose of desegregation because the decision will cause \nsubstantial white flight and because the burdens of closure will be born by the black community. \nWithout determining the merits ofthese issues in the context of the Motion to Intervene, this \ncourt notes that reliance on ''white flight\" has been rejected by the Eleventh Circuit. See Stell v. \nSavannah-Chatham County Bd. of Educ., 888 F .2d 82, 85 (11th Cir. 1989).  The court also notes \nthat, according to counsel for the applicants for intervention, the number of white students whom \ncounsel speculates will not attend the new consolidated high school is approximately twenty. \nThe issue before this court is whether the concerns and interests identified by the \napplicants for intervention are adequately represented by the existing parties.  \"If the court \n4 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 174   Filed 08/14/00   Page 5 of 8\ndetermined that the issues [the proposed intervenors] sought to present had been previously \ndetermined or if it found that the parties in the original action were aware of these issues and \ncompletely competent to represent the interests of the new group, it could deny intervention.\" \nHines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762, 765 (5th Cir.1973). It is well-established \nthat courts presume that a proposed intervenor's interest is adequately represented when an \nexisting party pursues the same ultimate objective as the party seeking intervention.  United \nStates v. State of Georgia, 19 F.3d 1388 (11th Cir. 1994).  To demonstrate that such interests are \nnot represented, there must be a showing of gross negligence or bad faith on the part ofthe \nparties in this case. Id. at 1394.  In addition, when the United States is a party, the moving party \nmust make a very compelling showing that representation of the public interest is inadequate. \nSee Jones v. Caddo Parish School Bd., 704 F.2d 206, 221 n.25 (51 Cir. 1983). \nh \nIn this case, the applicants for intervention have not rebutted the presumption of adequacy \nof representation by the Barbour County Board of Education or the Plaintiffs, nor have the \napplicants for intervention made a compelling showing of inadequacy of representation by the \nUnited States.  The applicants for intervention have argued that the Plaintiffs and the United \nStates have not adequately represented their interests because, although they now state that a \nmotion should have been filed in this court before the decision was made to consolidate the \nschools, the Plaintiffs and the United States did not insist that such a motion be filed before the \ndecision was made to close Louisville High School.  At the hearing, attorneys for the parties in \nthis case represented that the Plaintiffs and the United States were involved in the decision to \nclose Louisville High School.  This indicates to the court that the failure to file the appropriate \nmotion was perhaps an oversight, but was an oversight which occurred within the context of an \nunderstanding by all of the parties, and was not the product of gross negligence, bad faith, \n5 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 174   Filed 08/14/00   Page 6 of 8\ncollusion, or ineffective counsel. See United States v. South Bend Comm. School Corp., 692 \nF.2d 623, 628 (71h Cir. 1982). Accordingly, while the applicants for intervention understandably \nmay wish to present their arguments themselves, the court concludes that the Plaintiffs and the \nUnited States are aware of the issues raised by the applicants for intervention and are competent \nto represent these issues.  The court concludes, therefore, that the applicants for intervention are \nnot entitled to intervention as of right. \nThe applicants for intervention have also sought permissive intervention in this case. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) allows permissive intervention ifthe application to \nintervene is timely, and if the intervenor's claim or defense and the main issue of the cause have \na common question of fact. Id.  In exercising its discretion to grant or deny permissive \nintervention, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the \nadjudication of the rights of the original parties. Id. \nAs stated in open court, based on the representations made by attorneys representing the \nvarious parties at the hearing held on the Motion to Intervene, it appears to this court that the \nBoard of Education, the Plaintiffs, and the United States have for a long period of time been \nworking together toward achieving unitary status in all aspects of the school system of Barbour \nCounty, and that such efforts are active and ongoing.  To allow intervention of the applicants for \nintervention would unnecessarily complicate, and indeed could impede, the ongoing process of \nnegotiating toward the ultimate goal of desegregation. The court concludes, therefore, that this \nundue complication will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original \nparties, and the permissive intervention is due to be DENIED. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 24(b); see also \nUnited States v. Coffee County Board ofEduc., 134 F.R.D. 304 (S.D. Ga. 1974)(denying \npermissive intervention where intervention would hamper ongoing negotiations over a plan to \n6 \n\nCase 2:66-cv-02458-WHA-CSC   Document 174   Filed 08/14/00   Page 7 of 8\ndesegregate). Although this court is denying intervention to the applicants, the court will, as \nstated at the conclusion of the hearing on this matter, in ruling on the merits of the school closure \ndecision, consider the evidence submitted by the applicants for intervention which has been filed \nwith the court.  Moreover, the applicants for intervention are given permission to file an amicus \ncuriae brief in support of their position, should they choose to do so, by August 31, 2000. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed, the court concludes that the applicants for intervention are not \nentitled to intervene as of right, and this court exercises its discretion to deny permissive \nintervention.  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED as follows: \n1.  The Motion to Intervene and the accompanying Motion to Show Cause are DENIED. \n2.  The Motion to Deny Intervention is DENIED as moot. \n3.  The Motion to Amend the Motion to Intervene is GRANTED. \n4.  The applicants for intervention are GRANTED permission to file an amicus curiae \nbrief on or before August 31, 2000, should they choose to do so. \n5.
