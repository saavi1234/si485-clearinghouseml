    "summary": "<p>On October 26, 2011, the ACLU filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to compel the defendants to comply with its request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 U. S. C. ยง 552. The plaintiff sought the release of any and all records about the government's use and interpretation of USA Patriot Act Section 215 that authorized the government to obtain \"any tangible thing\" that was \"relevant to\" a terrorism investigation. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had violated 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(3), 552(a)(4), and 552(a)(6) by failing to make responsible efforts to search for the requested records, and failing to grant the plaintiffโs requests for waivers and/or limitations of fees, and failing to promptly process the plaintiffโs request and release the requested records. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant had wrongfully withheld records under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security and that it had exhausted its administrative remedies to obtain them.</p><p>On December 9, 2011, Judge William H. Pauley approved the partiesโ stipulation to narrow the scope of the plaintiffโs FOIA request to the following documents.</p><p>1.\tLegal opinions or memoranda concerning or interpreting USA Patriot Act Section 215;</p><p>2.\tGuidelines for government personnel regarding the use of USA Patriot Act Section 215;</p><p>3.\tReports provided to Congress by the defendants concerning the governmentโs interpretation or use of USA Patriot Act Section 215;</p><p>4.\tRulings, opinions, or memoranda of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) concerning USA Patriot Act Section 215; and </p><p>5.\tLegal opinions or memoranda concerning rulings, opinions, or memoranda of the FISC interpreting USA Patriot Act Section 215.</p><p>Judge Pauley also issued an order that gave the defendants until March 15, 2012 to process and produce these documents or notify the plaintiff of any complete or partial withholdings of these documents pursuant to FOIA exemptions.</p><p>On February 27, 2012, the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment regarding a report that had been received by congressional intelligence committees on the intelligence collection authorities authorized under USA Patriot Act Section 215.  Judge Pauley had previously held the report to be within the scope of the plaintiffโs FOIA request, and the New York Times had filed a parallel lawsuit against the defendants to obtain it. (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14694\">New York Times v. Department of Justice</a>). The defendants argued that:</p><p>1.\tThey had properly withheld the report under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security because public disclosure of the requested report would expose sensitive intelligence sources and methods to adversaries of the United States. </p><p>2.\tThey had also properly withheld the report under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3) for being exempted from disclosure by statute because the National Security Act of 1947, as amended by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act of 2004, protected intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. </p><p>On March 26, 2012, the plaintiff filed a cross motion for partial summary judgment regarding the report that had been received by congressional intelligence committees. It argued that:</p><p>3.\tThe report cannot be withheld in its entirety under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) or 552(b)(3) because it contains โsecret lawโ in the form of the governmentโs legal interpretation of its authority to collect โany tangible thingsโ pursuant to USA Patriot Act Section 215.</p><p>4.\tThe court, at a minimum, should conduct a private judicial review of an unredacted version of the report and order the defendant to the release segregable portions of it that describe the defendantsโ legal interpretation of US Patriot Action Section 215. </p><p>On May 17, 2012, Judge Pauley, having conducted a private judicial review of the requested report, granted the defendantsโ motion for summary judgment.  The judge held the defendants had properly withheld the report in its entirety because it contained information that could be used by the United Statesโ adversaries to threaten its foreign intelligence capacities and all non-exempt portions of the report were inextricably intertwined with the reportโs exempt portions that they could not be released in a redacted version of the report (872 F.Supp. 2d. 309).</p><p>In the meantime, from March 2012 to August 2012, the defendants released several hundred pages of documents but withheld several documents for reasons of personal privacy, national security, and interagency or intra-agency deliberative process. </p><p>On December 13, 2012, the plaintiff limited the scope of its FOIA request to information about the types of information and โtangible thingsโ the government believed Patriot Act Section 215 allowed it to collect and relevance standard the government used to determine whether Section 215 applied.</p><p>On February 8, 2013, the defendants released parts of thirty-five documents relating to congressional reports and withhold the remaining parts of these documents under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security. The defendants also withheld the following documents in full:</p><p>1.\tSix documents in possession of the FBI under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(7)(e) for being law enforcement techniques;</p><p>2.\tThe Weich Letter under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security; </p><p>3.\tThe Census Memorandum under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5) for being part of the interagency or intra-agency deliberative process; and</p><p>4.\tMore than Seventy-four documents in possession of the NSD under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security; twenty-four related to congressional reporting; nine of which related to internal government communication and analyses; forty of which related to guidelines and training documents; and an unspecified number related to FISC materials, opinions, and/or orders. </p><p>The defendants also provided Judge Pauley with a classified Vaughn Index that listed and described the withheld FISC documents for private judicial review. The defendants did not disclose the Vaughn Index to the plaintiff. Finally, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on their full and partial withholdings and argued that:</p><p>1.\tThey had properly withheld documents for reasons of national security, statutory exemption, deliberative process, and law enforcement techniques, and</p><p>2.\tThey had produced all reasonably segregable portions of the documents.</p><p>On April 26, 2013, the defendants filed a supplemental memorandum to their motion for summary judgment. They clarified that one of the withheld NSD document was also exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5) for being part of the interagency or interagency deliberative process. They also noted that all the NSD documents were also withheld under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3) for reasons of statutory exemption pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947.</p><p>On May 10, 2013, the plaintiff further reduced the scope of its FOIA request to the Census Memorandum and all the NSD documents except for the one withheld under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5). The plaintiff also filed a cross motion for summary judgment and argued that:</p><p>1.\tSubmitting a classified Vaughn Index for private judicial review without disclosure to the plaintiff, was procedurally improper as the defendants had yet not released a sufficiently detailed public explanation of their withholdings.</p><p>2.\tLegal interpretations of public law were not exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) or 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3).</p><p>3.\tFISC rules did not bar the defendants from disclosing FISC opinions under FOIA; and</p><p>4.\tThe Census Memorandum could not be withheld as a deliberative product under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5) because it embodied the defendantsโ working law, or alternatively, because the defendant had adopted and relied upon it. </p><p>On June 6, 2013, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) decided to declassify certain information related to the โbusiness recordsโ provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in response to publication of FISC orders in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">Guardian</a>. </p><p>On July 31, 2013, the defendants released parts of two congressional reports to the plaintiff and withheld the remaining parts under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security and under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3) for reasons of statutory exemption pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947. </p><p>On August 13, 2013, the parties agreed to withdraw their motions for summary judgment because the defendants required additional time to reprocess the documents contested in this lawsuit and determine what effect, if any, the DNIโs declassification decision had on their disclosure.</p><p>From September 2013 to January 2014, the defendants released parts of more than a thousand pages from dozens of documents, including parts of several FISC orders and legal opinions.</p><p>On February 7, 2014, the plaintiff further revised the scope of its FOIA request to fully withheld FISC opinions or orders that related to bulk collection of any information.</p><p>On April 4, 2014, the defendants filed motion for summary judgment and a Vaughn Index that referenced at least eight FISC orders and legal opinions that they were withholding in full and provided justifications for these withholdings. The defendants argued that these orders and opinions were properly withheld under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security and under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3) for reasons of statutory exemption pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947.  </p><p>On May 2, 2014, the plaintiff filed a cross motion for summary judgment. It argued the following:</p><p>1.\tThe withheld FISC orders contained legal reasoning and publicly acknowledged information that the government could not withhold under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) or 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3); and</p><p>2.\tJudge Pauley should evaluate the withheld FISC orders listed in the Vaughn Index in a private judicial review. </p><p>On July 8, 2014, the defendants released parts of three FISC orders in the public record that the plaintiff had identified as being absent in the Vaughn Index and the defendants had failed to locate in their previous search for documents within the scope of the plaintiffโs revised FOIA request.</p><p>On October 6, 2014, Judge Pauley granted in part the defendantsโ motion for summary judgment. He found that the defendants did not have to confirm or deny the existence of FISC orders and legal opinions that related solely to the bulk collection of information other than telephone metadata or release these orders and opinions if they existed. Lacking faith in the defendantsโ segregation determinations, the Judge also ordered the defendants release the remaining items in their Vaughn Index for private judicial review. (59 F.Supp.3d 584).</p><p>On October 24, 2014, the defendants submitted copies of the FISC orders and legal opinions withheld in full for private judicial review. They also filed a supplemental memorandum to their motion for summary judgment. They reiterated their argument that the FISC orders and legal opinions contained no reasonably segregable, disclosable information and were properly withheld in full under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security and under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3) for reasons of statutory exemption pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947.</p><p>On March 31, 2015, Judge Pauley granted the remaining part of the defendantsโ motion for summary judgment. He found that the FISC orders and legal opinions contained no reasonably segregable, disclosable information and were properly withheld in full under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1) for reasons of national security and under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3) for reasons of statutory exemption pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947. (2015 WL 1566775).</p><p>The case is closed. </p><p>The case is cross-referenced to <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14694\">New York Times v. Department of Justice</a>, which is also closed.</p>",

BRADLEY \n \nI, Mark A. Bradley, do hereby state and declare as follows: \n1.  I am the Director of the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ) and \nDeclassification Unit of the Office of Law and Policy in the National Security Division (โDOJ-\nNSDโ) of the United States Department of Justice (โDOJโ or โDepartmentโ).  DOJ-NSD is a \ncomponent of the Department.  DOJ-NSD formally began operations on October 2, 2006, by, \ninter alia, consolidating the resources of the Departmentโs Office of Intelligence Policy and \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 15    Filed 03/07/12   Page 2 of 5\nReview (โOIPRโ)1 and the Counterterrorism Section (โCTSโ) and Counterespionage Section \n(โCESโ) of the Departmentโs Criminal Division. \n2.  In addition, under a written delegation of authority pursuant to section 1.3.(c) of  \nExecutive Order 13526, I hold original classification authority at the TOP SECRET level.  I am \nauthorized, therefore, to conduct classification reviews and to make original classification and \ndeclassification decisions. \n3.  I submit this declaration in support of DOJโs Motion for Summary Judgment and \nfor Partial Summary Judgment in the above-captioned cases.  I make the statements herein on the \nbasis of personal knowledge, as well as on information acquired by me in the course of \nperforming my official duties.  I am also submitting a classified declaration in support of the \nGovernmentโs motion.  Because my classified declaration contains information that cannot be \nexplained on the public record, I am providing it for the Courtโs review ex parte and in camera. \n4.  By electronic mail message to DOJโs Office of Information Policy, dated May 27, \n2011, plaintiff New York Times reporter Charlie Savage requested a copy of โthe  \nreport received on February 2, 2011 by the congressional intelligence committees from the \nattorney general and the director of national intelligence, that pertains to intelligence collection \nauthorities that were subject to expiration under section 224 of the USA PATRIOT Actโ (the \nโNew York Times FOIA requestโ).    \n5.  Approximately one month later, on June 22, 2011, Mr. Savage forwarded his May \n27, 2011 email to DOJ-NSD. \n6.  The DOJ-NSD FOIA unit assigned this request number 11-214.  In a letter dated \nJune 27, 2011 and signed by DOJ-NSD FOIA Coordinator Arnetta Mallory, the DOJ-NSD FOIA \n                                                 \n1 OIPR is now known as the Office of Intelligence (โOIโ). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 15    Filed 03/07/12   Page 3 of 5\nunit acknowledged receipt of the request.  In a letter dated, August 2, 2011 and also signed by \nMs. Mallory, the DOJ-NSD FOIA unit stated that it had identified one responsive document, and \nwas withholding the responsive document in full pursuant to FOIA Exemption 1, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552 \n(b)(1), which protects classified information. \n7.  By letter dated May 31, 2011, plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union (โACLUโ) \nrequested โall records concerning the governmentโs interpretation or use of Section 215โ (the \nACLU FOIA requestโ).  The DOJ-NSD FOIA unit assigned this request number 11-198.  In a \nletter dated June 6, 2011, and signed by DOJ-NSD FOIA Coordinator Arnetta James,2 the DOJ-\nNSD FOIA unit acknowledged receipt of the request.  In a letter dated August 22, 2011, and \nsigned by me, the DOJ-NSD FOIA unit informed ACLU that it had searched the policy, \ncorrespondence, and senior management files within DOJ-NSDโs OI and located responsive \ndocuments, some of which were withheld in full.  One of the responsive documents withheld in \nfull was the same document responsive to the New York Times FOIA request. \n8.  For all the reasons set forth in my ex parte, in camera classified declaration and \naccompanying materials, the information in this document is currently and properly classified \nunder Executive Order 13526.  Specifically, the withheld information contained in this document \nmeets the criteria for classification as set forth in subparagraphs (c) and (g) of Section 1.4 of \nExecutive Order 13526, which respectively authorize the classification of information \nconcerning โintelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or \ncryptology,โ and โvulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, \nprojects, plans, or protection services relating to national security,โ which includes defense \nagainst transnational terrorism. \n                                                 \n2 Ms. Mallory changed her name from Arnetta James to Arnetta Mallory in the summer \nof 2011. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 15    Filed 03/07/12   Page 4 of 5\n9.  Because the withheld material is classified at the TOP SECRET level, its \ndisclosure could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the \nUnited States.  As set forth more fully in my ex parte, in camera classified declaration and \naccompanying materials, the withheld material contains specific descriptions of the manner and \nmeans by which the United States Government acquires tangible things for certain authorized \ninvestigations pursuant to Section 215.  As such, the withheld information describes highly \nsensitive intelligence activities, sources and methods.  Disclosure of this information would \nprovide our adversaries and foreign intelligence targets with insight into the United States \nGovernmentโs foreign intelligence collection capabilities, which in turn could be used to develop \nthe means to degrade and evade those collection capabilities. \n10.  Furthermore, the classified information in the responsive document is โowned by, \nproduced by or for, or under the control of the United States Government,โ as required by E.O. \n13526. \n11.  The responsive document contains no reasonably segregable, non-exempt \ninformation.  Any unclassified material in the responsive document, to the extent it exists, is so \ninextricably intertwined with the classified material that the release of any non-exempt \ninformation would produce only incomplete, fragmented, unintelligible sentences and phrases \nthat are devoid of any meaning.  The unclassified information in the responsive document, to the \nextent that any exists, does not contain any meaningful information responsive to the New York \nTimes and ACLU FOIA requests. \n12.  In addition, as set forth more fully in my ex parte, in camera classified declaration \nand accompanying materials, the withheld information is also exempt from disclosure pursuant  \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 15    Filed 03/07/12   Page 5 of 5",

It is submitted on behalf of \nthe American Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties \nFoundation (together, the \"ACLU\"). 1  \nI. Background \nThis request pertains to the use by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (\"FBI\") of the powers enumerated in Pub. L. 107-56, the \nUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools \nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly known as \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES  the USA PATRIOT Act (\"PATRIOT Act\"). Specifically, this request \nUNION FOUNDATION \npertains to the FBI's use and interpretation of Section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act, as amended, which permits the government to apply for \ncourt orders requiring the production of \"tangible things.\" \nII. Records Requested \nWe request that you release to us any and all records concerning \nthe government's interpretation or use of Section 215, including but not \nlimited to: legal opinions or memoranda interpreting that provision; \nguidelines informing government personnel how that provision can be \nused; records containing statistics about the use or misuse of the \nprovision; reports provided by the executive branch to Congress relating \nto the executive's interpretation, use, or misuse of the provision; forms \nused by executive agencies in connection with the use of Section 215; \nand legal papers filed by the government or any other party in the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and opinions of that court, \npertaining to the interpretation, use, or proposed use of Section 215. \nWith respect to the records described above, we seek only those \nrecords drafted, finalized, or issued after March 9, 2006. We do not ask \nyou to disclose the names or identities of those entities or individuals \nThe American Civil Liberties Union Foundation is a 26 U.S.C. ยง 501(c)(3) \norganization that provides legal representation free of charge to individuals and \norganizations in civil rights and civil liberties cases, and educates the public about the \ncivil liberties implications of pending and proposed state and federal legislation, \nprovides analyses of pending and proposed legislation, directly lobbies legislators, and \nmobilizes its members to lobby their legislators. The American Civil Liberties Union is \na separate non-profit, 26 U.S.C. ยง 501(c)(4) membership organization that educates the \npublic about the civil liberties implications of pending and proposed state and federal \nlegislation, provides analysis of pending and proposed legislation, directly lobbies \nlegislators, and mobilizes its members to lobby their legislators. \n\nwho have been served with Section 215 orders or the names or identities \nof those individuals or entities about whom records have been sought, \nbut we ask that you disclose any and all records indicating the kinds or \ntypes of information that may, as a matter of policy or law, be obtained \nthrough the use of Section 215. \nWith respect to the form of production, see 5 U.S.C. ยง \n552(a)(3)(B), we request that responsive electronic records be provided \nelectronically in their native file format, if possible. Alternatively, we \nrequest that the records be provided electronically in a text-searchable, \nstatic-image format (PDF), in the best image quality in the agency's \npossession, and that the records be provided in separate, bates-stamped \nfiles. \nIf any aspect of our request is unclear, we would welcome the \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES  opportunity to clarify it. We would also welcome the opportunity to \nUNION FOUNDATION \ndiscuss an appropriate processing schedule. \nIII. Application for Expedited Processing \nWe request expedited processing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง \n552(a)(6)(E); 28 C.F.R. ยง 16.5(d). Expedited processing is warranted \nbecause the records sought are urgently needed by an organization \nprimarily engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the \npublic about actual or alleged federal government activity, 28 C.F.R. ยง \n16.5(d)(1)(ii), and because the records sought relate to a \"matter of \nwidespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible \nquestions about the government's integrity which affect public \nconfidence,\" id. ยง 16.5(d)(1)(iv). \nA. Expedited processing is warranted under 28 C.F.R.  \n16.5(d)(ii)  \nThe records requested are needed to inform the public about \nfederal government activity. The records relate to the FBI's use of a \nhighly controversial surveillance authority. Specifically, the records \nrequested relate to the FBI's use of Section 215 and to the process the \nFBI has put in place to ensure that the FBI's use of Section 215 powers \nconforms to the requirements of the Constitution and statutory law. The \nrecords are urgently needed because of recent allegations by some \nmembers of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the Justice \nDepartment has adopted an overly broad interpretation of Section 215, 2  \n2  See Charlie Savage, Senators Say Patriot Act Is Being Misinterpreted, N.Y.

Its \nmaterial is available to everyone, including tax-exempt organizations, \nnot-for-profit groups, law students, and faculty, for no cost or for a \nnominal fee. Since 2007, ACLU national projects have published and \ndisseminated over 30 reports. Many ACLU reports include description \nand analysis of government documents obtained through FOIA. 4  \nThe ACLU also disseminates information through its website, \nwww.aclu.org. The website addresses civil liberties issues in depth, \nprovides features on civil liberties issues in the news, and contains \nhundreds of documents that relate to the issues on which the ACLU is \nfocused. The ACLU's website also serves as a clearinghouse for news \nabout ACLU cases, as well as analysis about case developments, and an \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES  archive of case-related documents. Through these pages, the ACLU \nUNION FOUNDATION \nalso provides the public with educational material about the \nparticular civil liberties issue or problem; recent news about the issue; \nanalyses of Congressional or executive branch action on the issue; \ngovernment documents obtained through FOIA about the issue; and \nmore in-depth analytic and educational multi-media features on the \nissue.5  The ACLU website includes many features on information \nobtained through the FOIA.6  For example, the ACLU's \"Torture \n4See, e.g., ACLU, Reclaiming Patriotism: A Call to Reconsider the Patriot Act (March \n2009), available at htt ://www.aclu t 20090310. cif. \n ACLU, The Excluded: Ideological Exclusion and the War on Ideas (Oct. 2007), \navailable at  http://www.aclu.org/national-security/excluded-ideological-exclusion-and-\nwar-ideas;  ACLU, History Repeated: The Dangers of Domestic Spying by Federal Law \nEnforcement (May 2007), available at \nhttp://www.aclu.org/files/FilesPDFs/m1kreport.pdf;  ACLU, No Real Threat: The \nPentagon's Secret Database on Peaceful Protest (Jan. 2007), available at \nhttp://www.aclu.org/national-security/no-real-threat-pentagons-secret-database-\npeaceful-protest;  ACLU, Unpatriotic Acts: The FBI's Power to Rifle Through Your \nRecords and Personal Belongings Without Telling You (July 2003), available at \nhttp://www.aclu.org/files/FilesPDFs/spies  report.pdf.  \n For example, the ACLU's website about national security letter (\"NSL\") cases, \n5 \nwww.aclu.org/nsl,  includes, among other things, an explanation of what NSLs are; \ninformation about and document repositories for the ACLU's NSL cases; links to \ndocuments obtained through FOIA about various agencies' use of NSLs; NSL news in \nthe courts, Congress, and executive agencies; links to original blog posts commenting \non and analyzing NSL-related news; educational web features about the NSL gag \npower; public education reports about NSLs and the Patriot Act; news about and \nanalysis of the Department of Justice Inspector General's reviews of the FBI's use of \nNSLs; the ACLU's policy analysis and recommendations for reform of the NSL \npower; charts with analyzed data about the government's use of NSLs; myths and facts \ndocuments; and links to information and analysis of related issues. \n6  See, e.g., http://www.aclu.org/accountability/released.html  (Torture FOIA); \nhttp://www.aclu.org/accountability/olc.html  (OLC Memos); \n\nFOIA\" webpage, http://www.aclu.org/accountability/released.html,   \ncontains commentary about the ACLU's FOIA request, press releases, \nanalysis of the FOIA documents, and an advanced search engine \npermitting webpage visitors to search approximately 150,000 pages of \ndocuments obtained through the FOIA. \nThe ACLU has also published a number of charts that collect, \nsummarize, and analyze information it has obtained through FOIA. For \nexample, through compilation and analysis of information gathered from \nvarious sourcesโincluding information obtained from the government \nthrough FOIAโthe ACLU has created a chart that provides the public \nand news media with a comprehensive index of Bush-era Office of \nLegal Counsel memos relating to interrogation, detention, rendition and \nsurveillance and that describes what is publicly known about the memos \nand their conclusions, who authored them and for whom, and whether \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES  the memos remain secret or have been released to the public in whole or \nUNION FOUNDATION \nin part.7  Similarly, the ACLU produced a chart of original statistics \nabout the Defense Department's use of National Security Letters based \non its own analysis of records obtained through FOIA. 8  \nB.

Supp. 2d 5, 10-15 (D.D.C. 2003) (finding nonprofit \npublic interest group that disseminated an electronic newsletter and \n\npublished books was a \"representative of the media\" for purposes of \nFOIA).16  \nIf the request is denied in whole or in part, we ask that you \njustify all withholdings by reference to specific exemptions to the FOIA. \nWe also ask that you release all segregable portions of otherwise exempt \nmaterial. We reserve the right to appeal a decision to withhold any \ninformation or to deny a waiver of fees. \nPlease be advised that, because we are requesting expedited \nprocessing under 28 C.F.R. ยงยง 16.11(d)(1)(iv) as well as 16.11(d)(1)(ii), \nwe are sending a copy of this letter to DOJ's Office of Public Affairs. \nWhatever the determination of that office, we look forward to your reply \nwithin 20 business days, as the statue requires under section \n552(a)(6)(A)(I). \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES \nUNION FOUNDATION \nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please \nfurnish all applicable records to: \nJameel Jaffer \nDeputy Legal Director \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union \n125 Broad St., 18th  Floor \nNew York, NY 10004 \n16  On account of these factors, fees associated with responding to FOIA requests are \nregularly waived on the grounds that the ACLU is a \"representative of the news \nmedia.\" In October 2010, the Department of the Navy granted a fee waiver to the \nACLU with respect to a request for documents regarding the deaths of detainees in \nU.S. custody. In January 2009, the CIA granted a fee waiver with respect to the same \nrequest. In March 2009, the Department of State granted a fee waiver to the ACLU \nwith respect to its request for documents relating to the detention, interrogation, \ntreatment, or prosecution of suspected terrorists. Likewise, in December 2008, the \nDepartment of Justice granted the ACLU a fee waiver with respect to the same request. \nIn May 2005, the Department of Commerce granted a fee waiver to the ACLU with \nrespect to its request for information regarding the radio frequency identification chips \nin United States passports. In March 2005, the Department of State granted a fee \nwaiver to the ACLU with respect to a request regarding the use of immigration laws to \nexclude prominent non-citizen scholars and intellectuals from the country because of \ntheir political views. Also, the Department of Health and Human Services granted a fee \nwaiver to the ACLU with regard to a FOIA request submitted in August of 2004. In \naddition, the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the \nPresident said it would waive the fees associated with a FOIA request submitted by the \nACLU in August 2003. Finally, three separate agenciesโthe Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, and the Office of \nInformation and Privacy in the Department of Justice (cid:9) did not charge the ACLU fees \nassociated with a FOIA request submitted by the ACLU in August 2002. \n\nUnder penalty of perjury, I hereby affirm that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief \nAlexander Abdo \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union \nFoundation \n125 Broad Street, 18th  Floor \nNew York, NY 10004 \nTel. 212-519-7814 \nFax 212-549-2654 \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES \nUNION FOUNDATION ",

( 552(a)(6)). \n3.  On May  31, 2011, Plaintiffs  submitted  a FOIA request  (\"the Request\" ) to the FBI \nand  the  DOJ's Offic of Information  Policy  (\"OIP\"), OIIice of Public  Alfairs  (\"OPA\"), Office of \nLegal  Counsel  (\"OI,C  \"), and  National  Security  Division  (\"NSD\") pertaining  to thc government's \ninterpretation  or use of the powers  enumerated  in the USA PATRIOT Act (\"P ATRIOT Act\"), \nPub. L. No. 107-56; 115 Stat. 272 (2001). Specifically,  the Request  pertains  to the FBI's use and \ninterpretation  of Section 215 of the I ISA PATRIOT Act, as amended,  which  permits  the \ngovernment  to apply  for court  orders  requiring  the production  ol' \"tangible  things. '\" \n4.  Plaintiffs  sought  expedited  processing  of the Request.  The NSD granted  that \nrequest  by letter  dated  Junc  1, 2011; thc I'BI, OIP, and  OLC did the same  by letters  daied  June  8, \n2011, June  9, 2011, and  June  15, 2011, respectively. \n5.  Plaintifls  also sought  a waiver  or limitation  of search,  review,  and  duplication \nfees.  The NSD granted  that request  by letter  dated  June  I, 2011; the FBI denied  that request  by \nletter  dated  July  6, 2011. \n6.  Four months  have  elapsed  since the ACLU  liled  the Request.  In a letter  dated \nAugust  22, 2011, the NSD released  three  items  and  communicated  a determination  to withhold \nother  responsive  items  and  records.  Del'endant  FBI has not released  any  responsive  records. \n7.  Defendants'  failure  to process  and  release  responsive  records  is of particular \nconcern  because  the records  relate  to a highly  controversial  surveillance  authority  the wisdom, \neffectiveness,  and  scope of which  are a matter  of intense  and  ongoing  public  debate.  The records \nsought  would  greatly  contribute  to thc public's  understanding  of the FBI's use of Section 215 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 1    Filed 10/26/11   Page 3 of 11\nand to the processes  that  the  government  has put  in place to ensure  that  that usc complies  with \nthe Constitution. \n8.  Plaintifls  seek an injunction  requiring  Defendants  to process  the Request \nimmediately.  Plaintiffs  also seek an order  enjoining  the  Defendants  from  assessing  fees for the \nprocessing  of the Request. \nJurisdiction  and  Venue \n9.  This  Court  has both  subject  matter  jurisdiction  of the FOIA claim  and personal \njurisdiction  over the parties  pursuant  to 5 U. S.C  ,  552(a)(4)(B), (a)(6)(F)(iii). This  Court  also \nII \nhas jurisdiction  over this  action  pursuant  to 2g U. S.C  . ) 1331 and  5 U. S.C  . $$ 701-706. Venue \nlies in this  district  under  5 U. S.C  . tI  552(a)(4)(B). \n10.  Because  Defendants  have  failed  to determine  an administrative  appeal  in the time \nset by FOIA, Plaintiffs  are deemed  to have  exhausted  all administrative  remedies  and  are now \nentitled  to appeal  directly  to the  Court  to enforce  the  dictates  of FOlA pursuant  to 5 U. S.C  . II \n552(a)(4)(B). \nParties \n11.  Plaintiff  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  is a nationwide,  non-profit,  nonpartisan \norganization  with  more  than  500, 000 members  dedicated  to the constitutional  principles  of \nliberty  and  equality.  Thc ACLU is committed  to ensuring  that the  American  government \ncomplies  with  the  Constitution  and  laws,  including  its international  legal  obligations,  in matters \nthat  affect civil liberties  and  human  rights.  Thc ACLU is also  committed  to principles  of \ntransparency  and  accountability  in government,  and  seeks to ensure  that  the American  public  is \ninformed  about  the conduct  of its government  in matters  that  affect civil  liberties  and  human \nrights. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 1    Filed 10/26/11   Page 4 of 11\n12.  Plaintiff  American  Civil Liberties  Union  Foundation  is a separate  501(c)(3) \nIJ \norganization  that  educates  the public  about  civil  liberties  and employs  lawyers  who  provide  legal \nrepresentation  free of charge  in cases involving  civil liberties. \n13.  Defendant  FBI is a component  of the DOJ.  It is headquartered  in Washington, \nD. C. and  has field offices throughout  thc country,  including  in New  York, NY. \n14.  Defendant  DOJ is a Department  of the  Executive  Branch  of the U. S. government \nand  an agency  within  the meaning  of 5 U. S.C  .  552(f)(l). Thc DOJ is headquartered  in \n1[ \nWashington,  D.C  . \nFactual  Background \n15.  Section 215 of the  Patriot  Acl, allows  the FBI to obtain  \"any tangible  things \n(including  books, records,  papers,  documents  and  other  items)  for an investigation  to protect \n\" \nagainst  international  terrorism  or clandestine  intelligence  activities, \n16.  Since the enactment  of the PATRIOT Act in 2001, Section 215 has received \nconsiderable  and  sustained  media  and public  attention  In rcccnt months,  as Congress  has \ndebated  rcauthorization  of ceitain  PATRIOT  Act provisions,  including  Section 215, media  and \npublic  attention  have  intensified. \n17.  As sct forth  in the Request,  many  recent  news  stories  have  included  allegations  by \nmembers  of the  Senate  Select Committee  on Intelligence  that  the DOJ has adopted  an overly \nbroad  construction  of Section 215. \n18.  While  the DOJ claimed  only  to have  used  Section 215 powers  21 times  in 2009 \nand  96 times  in 2010, Senators  Ron Wyden  and  Mark  Ildall,  along  with  others,  recently \nproffered  an amenrhnent  to address  the government's  \"secret[] reinterpretation  [of/ public  laws \n\" \nand  statutes  in a manner  that  is inconsistent  with  the public's  understanding  of these  laws.  They \n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 1    Filed 10/26/11   Page 5 of 11\nmade  clear that  they  had  specific  concerns  regarding  the  government's  interpretation  of Section \n215. \n19.  Further,  Senator  Wydcn  stated  in open  Congress  that  hc \"certainly  believe[s]  the \npublic  virill  bc surprised  again  when  they  learn  about  some  of the  interpretations  of'the  PATRIOT \n\" \nAct,  suggesting  that the FBI's numbers  or public  statements  have  bccn misleading  or \nincomplete. \n20.  In May 2009, Senators  Wyden  and  Udall  also offered  an amendment  that  would \nhave  limited  thc government's  ability  to use  Section 215 to collect records  about  people.  This \neffort to amend  was  also  unsuccessful. \n21.  Section 215 was  renewed  as part  of the PATRIOT  Act without  amendment,  and \nthe  concerns  regarding  its interpretation  have  not bccn resolved. \n~POIA R  t \n22.  On May  31, 2011, Plaintiffs  submitted  their  Request  for the release  of any  and  all \nrecords  concerning  the  govenunent's  interpretation  or use of Section 215, including  but  not \nlimited  to: \n\"legal opinions  or memoranda  interpreting  that  provision;  guidelines  informing \ngovernment  personnel  how that  provision  can be used;  records  containing  statistics \nabout  the use or misuse  of thc provision;  reporls  provided  by the  executive  branch \nto Congress  relating  to the executive's  interpretation,  use or misuse  of the \nprovision;  forms  used  by executive  agencies  in connection  with  the use of Section \n215; and  legal  papers  filed by the  government  or any  other  party  in the  1'oreign \nIntelligence  surveillance  Court,  and  opinions  of tha\"t  court,  pertaining  to the \ninterpretation,  use or proposed  use of Section 215. \n23.  With  respect  to the requested  records,  the Rcqucst  sought  only  those  records \ndrafted,  finalized  or issued  after March  9, 2006.  It made  clear that  it 'do[es] not ask you to \ndisclose  the names  or identities  of those  entities  or individuals  who  have  been  served  with \n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 1    Filed 10/26/11   Page 6 of 11\nSection 215 orders  or the names  or identities  of those  individuals  or entities  about  whom  records \n\" \nhave  been  sought. \n24.  The Request  also \"ask[ed] that  you  disclose  any  and  all records  indicating  the \nkinds  or types  of information  that may,  as a matter  of policy  or law,  be obtained  through  the use \n\" \nof Section 215. \n25.  Plaintiffs  sought  expedited  processing  ol' the Request  on the grounds  that there  is \na \"compelling  need\" for these  records  because  \"fite records  sought  are urgently  nccded  by an \norganization  primarily  engaged  in disseminating  information  in order  to inform  the public  about \n\" \nactual  or alleged  federal  government  activity,  and  \"relate  to a 'matter  of widespread  and \ncxccptional  media  interest  in which  there  exist possible  questions  about  thc government's \n\" \nintegrity  which  affect public  confidence.  See 5 U. S.C  . lI 552(a)(6)(E); see also 28 C. F.R  . 11 \n16.5 (d). \n26.  Plaintiffs  sought  a waiver  of search,  review,  and reproduction  fees on thc grounds \nthat  disclosure  of the requested  records  is \"likely to contribute  significantly  to public \nunderstanding  of the operations  or activities  of thc government  and  is not primarily  in the \n\" \ncommercial  interest  of the requester.  See 5 U. S.C  . ) 552(a)(4)(A)(iii); see also 28 C.F  .R  . ss \n] 6. 11.( kXI). \n27.  Plaintiffs  also sought  a waiver  of search,  review  and  duplication  fees on the \ngrounds  that  the ACI, U qualifies  as a \"representative  of the news  media\"  and  that  the records  are \nnot sought  for commercial  use.  See 5 U. S.C  . $ 552(a)(4)(A)(ii); see also 28 C. F.R  . $ 16.1  1. \n28.  The Request  was  submitted  to the designated  FOIA o11ice of the FIII as well  as \nthe DOJ's OIP, OPA,  OI, C, and  NSD. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 1    Filed 10/26/11   Page 7 of 11\nThe Government's  Res  onse to the  Re  ucst \n29.  In spite  of thc urgent  national  interest  surrounding  the requested  records,  the \ngovernment  has neither  released  all responsive  records  nor explained  its failure  to do so. \n30.  By letter  dated  Junc  I, 2011, the NSD acknowledged  receipt  of thc Request  and \nadvised  that  it had  granted  Plaintiffs'  applications  1'or a fee waiver  and  for expedited  processing, \nconcluding,  \"[y]ou have  demonstrated  that there  is a particular  urgency  to inform  the public \n\" \nabout  an actual  or alleged  federal  goverrunent  activity. \n31.

The letter \nalso advised  that  a decision  had  not been made  as to Plaintiffs'  request  for a fee waiver. \n33.  By letter  dated  June  15, 2011, the  OI, C acknowledged  receipt  of thc Request  and \nadvised  that  it had  granted  Plaintiffs'  request  for expedited  processing  pursuant  to the  DOJ's \nstandard  involving  \"a matter  of widespread  and  exceptional  media  interest  in which  there  exist \n\" \npossible  questions  about  the government's  integrity  which  affect public  conlidcncc.  The letter \nalso advised  that  a decision  had  not been  made  as to Plaintil'fs'  request  for a fee waiver.

By letter  dated  June  22, 2011, the  OIP advised  that  a search  had  been  conducted \nin the  Office of Legal  Policy  and  no records  responsive  to thc Request  had  been located.  It also \nadvised  that  the  OIP was  continuing  to search  records  in other  DOJ oflices. \n35.  By letter  dated  July  6, 2011, the FBI advised  that  it had  denied  Plaintiffs' \napplication  for a fee waiver. \n36.  By letter  dated  August  22, 2011, the NSD advised  that  it had  located  records \nresponsive  to thc Request,  and  that  it was  releasing  thrcc items  in full.  The letter  advised  that  the \nNSD had  determined  to withhold  an item  described  as \"Emails;  12/06/2009  through  3/12/2010;  8 \nfull  pages,  4 partial  pages  (partial  outside  scope, partial  referred  to OIP)\" pursuant  to FOIA \nexemptions  set forth  in 5 U.

In addition,  the  letter  stated,  \"we have  identified  other \nresponsive  records  from  NSD/OI  operational  case liles  created  to secure  surveillance  authorities \nfrom  the Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court.  All  such  records  are categorically  denied \nunder  5 U. S.C  . 552(b)(1) which  permits  the withholding  of information  properly  classified \n\" \npursuant  to Executive  Order  No. 13326.  Finally,  the letter  advised  that  the NSD had  referred \ncertain  DOJ leadership  ol'fice records  to the OIP, for review  and  direct  response. \n37.  By letter  dated  August  31, 2011, the OIP advised  that  it had  received  material \nfrom  the NSD for processing  and  direct  response. \n'  i~tt \nPl  i  tif'f  Ad  A \n38.  By letter  dated  August  19, 2011, Plaintil'fs  submitted  to OIP their  appeal  from the \nFBI's denial  of Plaintiffs'  request  for a public-interest  fee waiver  of thc Request.

Plaintiffs  repeat,  rcallege,  and  incorporate  thc allegations  in the  I'oregoing \nparagraphs  as though  fully  set forth  herein. \n46.  Defendants  are an agency  and  a component  thereof  subject  to FOIA, 5 U.

Pauley, III \nUnited States District Judge \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse \n500 Pearl Street \nNew York, NY 10007-131 \nRe:  ACLU et al. v. FBI et al., 11 Civ. 07562 (WHP) \nDear Judge Pauley: \nOn August 2, 2013, the Court ordered the parties in the above-referenced Freedom of \nInformation Act (\"FOIA\")  lawsuit to complete briefing in support of their cross motions for \nsummary judgment.  Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to file its reply/opposition \nbrief by September 10, 2013, and the ACLU to file its reply brief by October 3, 2013.  We write \non behalf of both parties to inform the Court that both the Government and the ACLU have \nagreed to withdraw their pending cross-motions for summary judgment in light of changed \ncircumstances. \nFurther, the Government has agreed that it will complete the processing of the documents \nin this case (not including the FISC Orders set forth in the final row of the Government's Vaughn \nindex) by October 31, 2013, with two interim processing deadlines of September 10, 2013, and \nOctober 10, 2013.  Specifically, the Government will complete its processing, including \ndeclassification review, of all the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") Opinions at \nissue in this case, and release any segregable information in these opinions that is not exempt \nunder the FOIA, by September 10, 2013.  The Government will complete its processing of a \nsecond tranche of documents by October 10, 2013, and will complete its processing of the \nremaining documents at issue, excluding the FISC Orders set forth in the final row of the \nGovernment's Vaughn index, by October 31, 2013.  To the extent that the Government reviews \nand declassifies any documents at issue in this case on a more accelerated schedule and \ndetermines they are not exempt under the FOIA, the Government will provide such documents to \nboth ACLU and the Court as soon as the review and declassification has been completed. \nAfter October 31, 2013, the parties will meet and confer, and will submit a status report \nto the Court no later than November 8, 2013.  In the status report, the parties either will inform \n\nthe Court of an additional deadline for the processing of the FISC Orders set forth in the final \nrow of the Government's Vaughn index or inform the Court that the ACLU has decided to drop \nits challenge to the remaining FISC Orders.  In either case, if necessary, the parties will propose \na schedule for summary judgment briefing to resolve any remaining issues in the case. \nThe parties respectfully request that the Court (1) approve and cause the docket to reflect \nthe withdrawal of the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment; (2) approve the schedule \nagreed upon by the parties for re-processing the documents at issue in this case; and (3) order the \nparties to submit a status report to the Court by November 8, 2013. \nWe respectfuiiy request that the Court docket this letter and make it a part of the record \nof this case. \nRespectfully, \nBy: \nAssistant U  ยท  d States Attar  e  s \nTelephone: (212) 637-2716 (  pper) \nTelephone: (212) 637-2777 (Daughtry) \nFacsimile: (212) 637-0033 \nj ohn.clopper@usdoj.gov \nemily.daughtry@usdoj.gov \nEncl. \ncc:  Charles Sims, Esq.

United States Department of Justice, 11 Civ. \n6990, and partial summary judgment in American Civil Liberties Union v. Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, 11 Civ. 7562.   \nAs set forth in the Governmentโs memorandum of law in support of its motion (โGov. \nOpening Br.โ), the Government properly withheld from disclosure the record at issue hereโa \nclassified report provided to Congress by the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence relating to an intelligence collection operation authorized by Section 215 of the USA \nPATRIOT Act (the โReportโ)โpursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3.  The Government has explained \nin both an unclassified declaration and a classified declaration submitted ex parte and in camera \nthat the Report is properly classified in its entirety because it describes a specific intelligence \ncollection operation and public revelation of this operation would provide the United Statesโ \nadversaries and foreign intelligence targets with insight into the Governmentโs intelligence \ncollection capabilities.  Furthermore, the Report is exempt from disclosure under Section 102A \nof the National Security Act of 1947, as amended by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, 50 U.S.C. ยง 403-1(i), because, inasmuch as the Report describes a \nspecific intelligence collection operation, its disclosure would reveal intelligence sources and \nmethods.       \nIn their opposition and cross-motion, plaintiffs do not seriously contend that the \nGovernmentโs explanation for withholding the Report is not logical or plausibleโwhich is all it \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 10 of 33\n \nneed be in order for the Government to prevail on summary judgment.  Instead, plaintiffs have \nattacked the Governmentโs withholding primarily on the grounds that the declarations submitted \nby the Government are insufficient in various ways.  Plaintiffs also rely on the novel argument \nthat, regardless of the applicability of FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, a classified document \ndescribing intelligence activities and containing sensitive intelligence sources and methods \ncannot be withheld because it constitutes โsecret law.โ     \nNone of plaintiffsโ arguments regarding the insufficiency of the Governmentโs \ndeclarations have any merit.  As an initial matter, plaintiffs draw attention to FOIAโs de novo \nstandard of review, without acknowledging the deference that is owed to the Executive Branchโs \nunique expertise in assessing the harm to national security that could result from release of \ninformation in the Report.  Plaintiffs also speculate that the Report contains โabstract legal \nanalysis,โ and they then posit that such legal analysis must be segregable from any classified \ninformation, despite the fact that the Governmentโs submissions have consistently and \nspecifically explained that the Report describes an intelligence collection operation and contains \nno segregable information.  And although plaintiffs complain that the Governmentโs public \nfilings contain insufficient information to allow the Court to determine whether the record was \nproperly withheld under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, the Government has submitted declarations \nthat confirm a proposition that plaintiffs ultimately do not, and cannot, take issue withโnamely, \nthat disclosing information regarding a specific, secret intelligence collection operation to the \nnationโs adversaries will harm national security.   In its public filing, the Government has \nprovided as much detail as possible, consistent with its obligation to maintain the secrecy of the \ninformation contained in the record, and with sufficient specificity to permit plaintiffs to \nparticipate meaningfully in the litigation.  To the extent further information would facilitate the \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 11 of 33\n \nCourtโs review, the Government has properly supplemented its public filings with a classified \ndeclaration submitted in camera.  Taken individually or together, the Governmentโs submissions \ndescribe the Report with the reasonable specificity necessary to allow the Court to undertake \nmeaningful review.     \nPlaintiffsโ argument that the Report cannot be withheld because it constitutes โsecret lawโ \nis equally without merit.  It is not accurate to characterize the Report as โsecret lawโ that must be \ndisclosed under FOIA.  In fact, the concept of โsecret lawโ has never been applied in the context \nof Exemptions 1 and 3, nor does it make any sense to import to this concept here.  To be sure, the \nReport has been classified because it relates to intelligence collection activities, the disclosure of \nwhich would harm national security and undermine the effectiveness of the nationโs intelligence \ntools.  But FOIA does not require that the Government disclose a court-authorized, properly \nclassified intelligence operation carried out pursuant to a public statute simply because plaintiffs \nhave mislabeled it โsecret law.โ      \nARGUMENT \nI.  EXEMPTION 1 AUTHORIZES THE WITHHOLDING OF THE REPORT \nA.  The Report Is Properly Classified  \nThe Governmentโs declarations, including both the unclassified and classified \ndeclarations of Mark A. Bradley (โUnclass. Bradley Decl.โ and โClass. Bradley Decl.,โ \nrespectively), establish that the classification of the Report is both procedurally and substantively \nproper.   See Gov. Opening Br. at 7-9.  First, the information in the Report has been reviewed by \nan original classification authority.  See Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ 2, Class. Bradley Decl.  \nFurther, the information contained in the Report falls within one of the eight protected categories \nlisted in Section 1.4 of Executive Order 13526.  Specifically, the Report is covered by the \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 12 of 33\n \ncategories set forth in subparagraphs (c) and (g), which respectively authorize the classification \nof information concerning โintelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources \nor methods, or cryptology,โ and โvulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, \ninfrastructures, projects, plans or protection services relating to national security.โ  E.O. 13526 ยง \n1.4(c), (g); see also Unclass. Bradley Decl. at ยถ 8.  In addition, the classified information in the \nReport is โowned by, produced by or for, or under the control of the United States Government,โ \nalso as required by E.O. 13526.  Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ 10.   \nAs set forth in the Governmentโs declarations, the release of the Report could be expected \nto cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security by providing the United Statesโ \nadversaries and foreign intelligence targets with insights into the Governmentโs foreign \nintelligence collection capabilities.  Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ 9; Class. Bradley Decl.  Mr. \nBradley further explains that these insights โin turn could be used to develop the means to \ndegrade and evade those collection capabilities.โ  Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ 9.  The Government \nhas provided further information in its classified filing, including a more robust description of \nthe contents of the Report and a more detailed description of the national security harm that \nwould result from its release.  See Class. Bradley Decl.  The law is clear that โ[a]n agencyโs \njustification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears logical or plausible.โ  \nWilner v. NSA, 592 F.3d 60, 73 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nThe Governmentโs explanation of harm, on the public record alone, meets that standard.   \nWhile plaintiffs may disagree with Mr. Bradleyโs assessment, their conjecture that release \nof the Report would strengthen rather than harm national security by โalleviat[ing] public \nconcernsโ and โreaffirming the nationโs commitment to the rule of law,โ New York Times \nMemorandum of Law in Opposition to the Governmentโs Motion for Summary Judgment and in \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 13 of 33\n \nSupport of Their Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (โNY Times Br.โ) at 17 n.5, has no basis \nin either law or fact.  While such arguments may be fodder for a vigorous political debate, they \nsimply do not provide a legal ground for the overturning the Governmentโs assessment of harm.  \nIndeed, the Court should reject plaintiffsโ effort to second-guess the Executive Branchโs \npredictions of harm to national security, which is โa uniquely executive purview,โ Ctr. for Natโl \nSec. Studies v. DOJ, 331 F.3d 918, 926-27 (D.C. Cir. 2003), โbecause the Executive departments \nresponsible for national defense and foreign policy matters have unique insights into what \nadverse affects [sic] might occur as a result of a particular classified record.โ  Id. at 927.  Unlike \nplaintiffsโ uninformed speculation, which is entitled to no deference from the Court, the \nGovernmentโs determination of harm in national security cases is entitled to deference.  See id. \n(noting that courts have โconsistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting harm to national \nsecurity, and have found it unwise to undertake searching judicial reviewโ on this issue). \nB.  Plaintiffsโ Attacks on the Governmentโs Declarations Are Without Merit \nNevertheless, plaintiffs attack the Governmentโs declarations as deficient for several \nreasons.  First, plaintiffs argue that the Court should not grant deference to the Governmentโs \ndeclarations.  Second, plaintiffs argue that the unclassified declaration fails to sufficiently \naddress whether the Report contains segregable โlegal analysis.โ  Third, plaintiffs argue that the \nunclassified declaration lacks the required level of specificity, and that the Governmentโs use of \na classified declaration is inappropriate.  As set forth below, none of these arguments has merit.   \n1.  The Standard of Review Calls for Deference to the Bradley Declarations \na.  The Court Should Defer to the Governmentโs Assessment of National \nSecurity Harm \nPlaintiffsโ suggestion that the Court should not grant deference to the Governmentโs \nclassification of the Report is inconsistent with well-established law.  While plaintiffs are correct \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 14 of 33\n \nthat courts review de novo an agencyโs withholding of information in response to a FOIA \nrequest, see NY Times Br. at 9, โde novo review in FOIA cases is not everywhere alike,โ  Assoc. \nof Retired R.R. Workers, Inc. v. U.S.R.R. Ret. Bd., 830 F.2d 331, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Plaintiffs \ndisregard the case law requiring that, in assessing the Governmentโs determination of whether \ndisclosure would harm national security in cases involving Exemption 1, deference be given to \nagency affidavits.  See Wilner, 592 F.3d at 76 (citing Ctr. for Natโl Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at \n927); Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  With respect to national security \nmatters, while de novo review provides for โan objective, independent judicial determination,โ \ncourts nonetheless defer to an agencyโs determination in the  national security context, \nacknowledging that โthe executive ha[s] unique insights into what adverse affects might occur as \na result of public disclosure of a particular classified record.โ  Ray, 587 F.2d at 1194. \nAccordingly, โin the context of national security concerns, courts must accord substantial \nweight to an agencyโs affidavit concerning the details of the classified statusโ of a particular \nrecord.  Wolf v. CIA, 473 F.3d 370, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in \noriginal); see also Diamond v. FBI, 707 F.2d 75, 79 (2d Cir. 1983).  Indeed, โthe court is not to \nconduct a detailed inquiry to decide whether it agrees with the agencyโs opinions; to do so would \nviolate the principle of affording substantial weight to the expert opinion of the agency.โ  \nHalperin v. CIA, 629 F.2d 144, 148 (D.C. Cir. 1980); accord Wilner, 592 F.3d at 73; Diamond, \n707 F.2d at 79; see also Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 766 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (disapproving the \ndistrict courtโs use of โits own calculus as to whether or not harm to the national security or to \nintelligence sources and methods would result from disclosureโ).  In other words, in FOIA cases \ninvolving Exemption 1, de novo review includes substantial deference to the Executive Branch \nwith respect to the predicate national security findings underlying the classification of \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 15 of 33\n \ndocuments.  Ctr for Natโl Sec. Studies, 331 F.3d at 927; accord Larson v. Depโt of State, 565 \nF.3d 857, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 766.   \nb.  The Bradley Declarations Are Entitled To a Presumption of Good Faith \nMoreover, the Governmentโs declarations are entitled to a presumption of good faith.  \nWilner, 592 F.3d at 69.  Plaintiffs suggest that the Court should not grant deference to the \nGovernmentโs declarations, arguing that there is reason to โsuspect[]โ bad faith in the \nGovernmentโs decision to withhold the Report because โ[t]wo U.S. Senators have publicly said \nthat the Government is misleading the public aboutโ Section 215.  NY Times Br. at 19.  Neither \nof the cases upon which plaintiffs rely, however, support their argument.  In Wilner, the National \nSecurity Agency provided a Glomar response to a FOIA request related to the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program (โTSPโ).  592 F.3d at 75.  The plaintiffs argued that no deference to the \nNSAโs affidavits should be given because, the plaintiffs argued, the TSP was an unlawful \nprogram and the agency was attempting to hide its illegality.  See id. The Second Circuit rejected \nthe argument, finding no bad faith on the part of the agency because there was no โevidenceโ that \nthe agency was acting to conceal โillegal or unconstitutional actions.โ  Id.  Similarly, in Jones v. \nFBI, 41 F.3d 238, 242-243 (6th Cir. 1994), the Sixth Circuit held that โwhere [] evidence [of \nunderlying illegal conduct] is strong,โ the Governmentโs affidavits would not be entitled to \ndeference.   \nPlaintiffs have not provided any evidence that the Government is withholding the Report \nfor the purpose of concealing illegal conduct.  To the contrary, the intelligence collection \noperation described in the Report has been authorized by an Article III court.  Plaintiffs do not \nclaim that the two U.S. Senators have asserted that any illegal conduct has occurred.  Rather, \nplaintiffs rely on statements that the Government is โmisleadingโ the public.  Even if these \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 16 of 33\n \nstatements were trueโand they are notโthey do not constitute evidence that the Government \nhas classified the Report in order to conceal illegal conduct, as required by Wilner.1 \nAccordingly, in the absence of evidence of bad faith, where a court has enough \ninformation to understand why an agency classified information, it should not second-guess the \nagencyโs facially reasonable classification decisions.  Wilner, 592 F.3d at 75 (according \ndeference to agency declarations and stating that it โ[could] not base [its] judgment on mere \nspeculation that the NSA was attempting to conceal [] purported illegality . . . .โ).  See also \nFrugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d 772, 775 (D.C. Cir. 1999). \n2.  The Report Does Not Contain Segregable โAbstract Legal Analysisโ  \nPlaintiffs also argue that the Court should overturn the Governmentโs classification \ndetermination based on their mistaken speculation that the Report contains โabstract legal \nanalysis,โ see NY Times Br. at 11, that is functionally segregable from information regarding a \nclassified intelligence collection operation.  Although plaintiffs never explicitly define what they \nmean by โabstract legal analysis,โ it is appears that plaintiffs are attempting to create a \n                                                 \n1  With respect to the statements of the Senators cited by the plaintiffs more generally, it \nalso bears noting that courts have held that contrary views of the Legislative Branch, and even of \nformer Executive Branch officials, regarding harm to national security are not sufficient to \nundermine an agencyโs affidavit even when, unlike here, those views are directly presented to the \ncourt in declarations.  For example, in Washington Post v. DOD, No. 84-2949, 1987 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 16108, at *19-20 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 1987), the Washington Post sought a classified report \ndescribing certain military operations.  In support of its request, the Washington Post submitted a \ndeclaration from Senator Edward Zorinsky.  Senator Zorinsky had reviewed the report, and \nclaimed in his declaration that release of the information contained in the report would not \npresent a threat to national security.  Id.  The district court rejected this attempt to undermine the \nGovernmentโs declarations in support of its classification of the report, stating โ[a]n affidavit that \ngives a view of national security harm differing from that presented by the government is alone \nnot sufficient to undermine an agencyโs affidavit, even when submitted by an individual \nknowledgeable in the agencyโs area of expertise.โ  Id.  See also Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, \nInc. v. Depโt of the Navy, 891 F.2d 414, 421-22 (2d Cir. 1989) (declining to accept opinion of \nformer admiral that classified information had been publicly disclosed and was therefore no \nlonger classified); Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d 1100, 1106 n. 5 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (holding that \naffidavit of former CIA official attesting to lack of harm did not undermine agencyโs affidavits). \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 17 of 33\n \ndistinction between factual information about specific intelligence operations described in the \nReport and legal analysis.  See, e.g., NY Times Br. at 8, 11, 16 (โPlaintiffs seek access only to \nlegal analysis and legal conclusionsโ but not โanything about specific and legitimately shielded \nintelligence sources or methodsโ).  In their view, legal analysis would not tend to reveal the \nclassified factual information.  Based on this imagined distinction, plaintiffs argue that the \nGovernment is required to segregate the โabstract legal analysisโ from the classified factual \ninformation and release the legal analysis.  NY Times Br. at 8, 11, 16. \nHowever, there is no โabstract legal analysisโ in the Report of the sort that appears to be \nenvisioned by plaintiffs.  As set forth in the accompanying Supplemental Declaration of Mark \nBradley (the โSupp. Bradley Decl.โ), the Report contains no analysis that is not inextricably \nintertwined with information about classified intelligence activities.  Supp. Bradley Decl. ยถ 9.  \nAnd, as even the plaintiffs recognize, the law is clear that non-exempt information that is \nโinextricably intertwinedโ with exempt information is not segregable and need not be disclosed.  \nSee NY Times Br. at 23 (citing cases); see also Inner City Press/Cmty. on the Move v. Bd. of \nGovernors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 463 F.3d 239, 249 n.10 (2d Cir. 2006).   \nHere, as Mr. Bradley explains, while the Report refers to the statute that authorizes and \nforms the basis of the classified intelligence collection operation, any reference to that statutory \nbasis is inextricably intertwined with and not segregable from the description of the intelligence \ncollection operation.  Supp. Bradley Decl. ยถ9.  Mr. Bradley explains that no part of the Report \ncan be meaningfully separated from classified information such that its release would not also \nreveal classified information.  Id.  In short, the Report does not contain any legal analysis, \nabstract or otherwise, that is not bound up with the description of the intelligence collection \noperation.  In the judgment of the Executive Branch, release of any portion of the Report, \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 18 of 33\n \nwhether characterized as legal analysis or not, would disclose classified information about the \nintelligence collection operation, and that judgment is entitled to this Courtโs deference.  See \nFerrigno v. U.S. Depโt of Homeland Security, 09 Civ. 5878 (RJS), 2011 WL 1345168, at *10 \n(S.D.N.Y. March 29, 2011). \n3.  The Governmentโs Declarations Provide Sufficient Detail  \n  Plaintiffs also contend that the Governmentโs declarations are not sufficiently detailed to \njustify withholding the Report as classified.  NY Times Br. at 15.  But plaintiffs demand far more \nspecificity than the law requires.  An agencyโs Exemption 1 declaration must be โspecific \nenough to afford the FOIA requester a meaningful opportunity to contest, and the district court \nan adequate foundation to review, the soundness of the withholding,โ and it must demonstrate \nโthat material withheld is logically within the domain of the exemption claimed,โ  King v. DOJ, \n830 F.2d 210, 217, 218 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  At the same time, however, an Exemption 1 \ndeclaration need not contain โโfactual descriptions that if made public would compromise the \nsecret nature of the information.โโ  Hayden v. NSA, 608 F.2d 1381, 1384-85 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \na.  The Unclassified Declaration Provides โLogical and Plausibleโ Grounds for \nWithholding the Report \n  Here, the Government has described the contents of the Report and the justification for \nwithholding it with sufficient detail to allow the Court to evaluate whether the Report is properly \nclassified.  In its public filings, the Government has provided as complete a description of the \nReport as possible without revealing classified information:  it is a report provided to Congress \non a classified basis by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence on \nFebruary 2, 2011 relating to an intelligence collection operation authorized by Section 215 of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act.  Further, the Government has explained that the Report contains โspecific \ndescriptionsโ of the โmanner and means by which the United States Government acquires \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 19 of 33\n \ntangible things for certain authorized investigations pursuant to Section 215.โ  Unclass. Bradley \nDecl. ยถ 9.  In addition, if those descriptions were revealed, โhighly sensitive intelligence \nactivities, sources and methodsโ would be exposed.  Id.  In short, as the unclassified declaration \nexplains, the Report was provided by high-level officials in the United States Government with \nresponsibility for protecting national security to members of Congress with intelligence oversight \nresponsibility, and describes an intelligence collection operation.  Moreover, Section 215 is a \npublic law, the contents of which are known:  Section 215 permits the Government to apply to \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (โFISA Courtโ) for a court order directing the \nproduction of โany tangible thingsโ for certain authorized investigations.  50 U.S.C. ยง \n1861(a)(1).   \n  Nor does the unclassified Bradley Declaration โmerely restat[e] the standardsโ in the \nExecutive Order, as plaintiffs argue.  See NY Times Br. at 17.  Rather, the declaration sets forth \na โlogical and plausibleโ basis, see Wilner, 592 F.3d at 73; ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d 612, 619 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011), for Mr. Bradleyโs conclusion that harm would result from the disclosure of the \nReport.  He explains that because the document describes an intelligence collection operation, \nthe disclosure of the Report could provide insight into the nationโs foreign intelligence \ncapabilities that the United Statesโ adversaries and foreign intelligence targets could use to evade \nthe collection capabilities or to develop a means to degrade those capabilities.  Notwithstanding \nplaintiffsโ rhetoric, it is simply not an โempty blanket assertionโ to posit that if a secret \nintelligence operation is made public, it becomes easier for an adversary to undermine that \noperation.  See Wilner, 592 F.3d at 73.  This is no less true for the intelligence collection \noperation described in the Report as it is for any other intelligence collection operation that relies \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 20 of 33\n \non secrecy for its effectiveness.  See, e.g., Azmy v. DOD, 562 F. Supp. 2d 590, 600 (S.D.N.Y. \n2008); Larson, 565 F.3d  at 863.    \nTo the extent that the Governmentโs unclassified filings do not provide more extensive \ndetail of the national security harm involved here, a more detailed discussion cannot be provided \non the public record.  See Hayden, 608 F.2d at 1384-85.   \nb.  The Governmentโs Submission of  a Classified Declaration Is Proper  \nMoreover, should the Court need more detailed information than can be provided on the \npublic record, the Government has provided further support for its withholding of the Report in a \nclassified declaration.  The classified declaration provides additional detail regarding the \nintelligence collection operation itself as well as the ways in which the United Statesโ adversaries \nand foreign intelligence targets could use that classified information to the detriment of the \nUnited States.  See Class. Bradley Decl.   \nPlaintiffs complain that the Government has relied too heavily on the classified \ndeclaration, NY Times Br. at 11, but in FOIA cases involving classified materials, the interest in \nan open adversarial process must be balanced against the concern that public disclosure of \ninformation during litigation will jeopardize national security.  As one court in this District \nrecently explained: \nImportant as the constitutional right to due process and the judicial systemโs \ndedication to an adversarial process are, protecting the national security would be \na futile effort if those interests automatically trumped national security concerns.  \nThe law reflects these competing objectives and allows for some sacrifice of the \nadversarial process in limited circumstances with national security is implicated. \nACLU v. DOD, No. 09 Civ. 8071 (BSJ), slip op. at 5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2012). \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 21 of 33\n \nHere, the Government has submitted an ex parte classified declaration in order to protect \nwhat courts have recognized as a compelling interest in preventing public disclosure of sensitive \nand classified information.  Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 634โ35 (2006).   \nIn light of the Governmentโs compelling interest in protecting national security, courts \nhave consistently recognized (and exercised) their โinherent authority to review classified \nmaterial ex parte, in camera as part of [their] judicial review function.โ Jifry v. FAA, 370 F.3d \n1174, 1182 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see also ACLU, 09 Civ. 8071, slip op. at 2 (โ[I]n the FOIA context, \nthat reluctance [to rely on ex parte submissions] dissipates considerably when the case raises \nnational security concernsโ); accord Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d \n156, 164 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Natโl Council of Resistance of Iran v. Depโt of State, 251 F.3d 192, \n208โ09 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Indeed, in sensitive national security cases, โit is simply not possible \nto provide for orderly and responsible decisionmaking about what is to be disclosed, without \nsome sacrifice to the pure adversary process,โ and โCongress has acknowledged that judges must \nsometimes make these decisions without full benefit of adversary comment on a complete public \nrecord.โ  Hayden, 608 F.2d at 1385; see In re New York Times Co., 577 F.3d 401, 410 n.4 (2d \nCir. 2009) (courts must balance transparency with need to protect sensitive information); Sterling \nv. Tenet, 416 F.3d 338, 348 (4th Cir. 2005) (โthe fundamental principle of access to court must \nbow to the fact that a nation without sound intelligence is a nation at riskโ).  \n  Thus, when classified national security information is at issue, โin camera review of \naffidavits, followed if necessary by further judicial inquiry, will be the norm.โ Stillman v. CIA, \n319 F.3d 546, 548 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting McGehee v. Casey, 718 F.2d 1137, 1149 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  This is true in a wide variety of contexts, including FOIA.  Hayden, 608 F.2d at 1385โ\n86; Pollard v. FBI, 705 F.2d 1151, 1153โ54 (9th Cir. 1983); Amnesty Intโl USA v. CIA, 728 F. \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 22 of 33\n \nSupp. 2d 479, 507โ08 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).  In sum, in a FOIA case such as this, where โpublic \nitemization and detailed justification would compromise legitimate secrecy interests,โ it is \nโappropriate to receive affidavits in camera rather than in public.โ Hayden, 608 F.2d at 1385.   \nc.  The Cases Cited by Plaintiff Challenging the Declarations Are Inapposite \nThe cases cited by plaintiffs for the proposition that the Governmentโs declarations are \ninadequate are inapposite.  See NY Times Br. at 17-18 (citing Halpern v. FBI, 181 F.3d 279 (2d \nCir. 1999), ACLU v. ODNI, 10 Civ. 4419 (RJS), 2011 WL 5563520 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2011), \nEl Badrawi v. DHS, 583 F. Supp. 2d 285 (D. Conn. 2008), and Associated Press v. DOD, 498 F. \nSupp. 2d 707 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)).  The courts in these cases found that the Governmentโs \ndeclarations failed to provide the โreasonable specificityโ needed for declarations to perform \ntheir โfunctional purposeโ of allowing both the plaintiffs to contest the conclusions in the \ndeclarations and the courts the opportunity to engage in meaningful review.  See Halpern, 181 \nF.3d at 293.  But unlike the instant case, the cases all involved multiple documents and/or \nmultiple redactions, and the courtsโ concerns focused on the fact that the declarations described \ncategories of withheld documents or information, using language that was not specifically \ntailored to the particular documents or redactions at issue.  Thus, these courts found that those \ndeclarations failed to provide the necessary context to explain why the documents were \nclassified, and specifically how the release of any particular document would harm national \nsecurity.  See Halpern, 181 F.3d at 292-293; ACLU v. ODNI, 2011 WL 5563520, at * 4 -12; El \nBadrawi, 583 F. Supp. 2d  at 314; Associated Press, 498 F. Supp. 2d at 711. \nBy contrast, the Unclassified Bradley Declaration makes clear that the single document at \nissue is a report submitted to Congress by the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence that โcontains specific descriptionsโ of the ways in which the Government conducts \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 23 of 33\n \nโcertain authorized investigations pursuant to Section 215.โ  Furthermore, the report โdescribes \nhighly sensitive intelligence activities, sources and methods.โ  Compare Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ \n9 with El Badrawi, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 314 (document at issue contains โinformation relating to \nintelligence sources and methods) (emphases added).  The Supplemental Bradley Declaration \nfurther clarifies that the Report โdescribes a classified intelligence collection operation.โ  Supp. \nBradley Decl. ยถ 9.  By providing this understanding of the contents of the Report, the \nGovernment has provided the requisite specificity needed for the declarations to perform their \nโfunctional purpose,โ namely for plaintiffs and the Court to evaluate the Governmentโs very \nspecific description of the harm to national security that would result from its disclosure, namely \nthat it โwould provide our adversaries and foreign intelligence targets with insight into the \nUnited States foreign intelligence collection capabilities,โ which they could then use โto  develop \nthe means to degrade and evade those collection capabilities.โ  Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ 9.   \nMoreover, in order to ensure that the Court has sufficient information, the Government \nhas provided a classified declaration, setting forth additional detail that cannot be revealed on the \npublic record, for the Courtโs review in camera.  See Class. Bradley Decl.2   \nII.  EXEMPTION 3 AUTHORIZES THE WITHHOLDING OF THE \nREPORT  \nThe Government has also shown that the Report is exempt from release pursuant to \nExemption 3.  As explained in the Governmentโs opening brief, the Report was properly \nwithheld pursuant to Section 102A the National Security Act of 1947, as amended by the \n                                                 \n2  While the Government does not dispute the Courtโs authority to conduct an in camera \nreview of the Report itself, it bears noting that, contrary to plaintiffsโ assertions, see NY Times \nBr. at 21-24, in camera review is discouraged in national security cases like this one.  See \nLarson, 565 F.3d at 870.   \n \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 24 of 33\n \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, 50 U.S.C. ยง 403-1(i).  See Gov. \nOpening Br. at 10.  This statute protects intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized \ndisclosure and indisputably qualifies as an Exemption 3 statute.   See New York Times Co. v. \nDOD, 499 F. Supp. 2d 501, 512 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d at 619.  Here, the \ninformation in the Report is protected from disclosure by the National Security Act because the \nReport โdescribes highly sensitive intelligence activities, sources and methods.โ  See Unclass. \nBradley Decl. ยถ 9; Class. Bradley Decl. \nPlaintiffs all but ignore the Governmentโs invocation of Exemption 3 to withhold the \nReport, making only the unremarkable observation that the Governmentโs ability to protect \ninformation from disclosure under the National Security Act is not โboundless,โ NY Times Br. at \n14, but limited to โsecrecy for โintelligence sources and methods,โโ id.  The Government does \nnot disagree, and does not invoke the National Security Act to protect anything other than \nintelligence sources and methods.  See Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ 12; Class. Bradley Decl. \nThe cases cited by plaintiffsโFounding Church of Scientology v. NSA, 610 F.2d 824 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); ACLU v. ODNI, No. 10 Civ. 4419 (RJS), 2012 WL 1117114 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. \n30, 2012); Navasky v.CIA, 499 F. Supp. 269 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), and Terkel v. AT&T, 441 F. Supp. \n2d 899 (N.D. Ill. 2006)โare cited for the unexceptional proposition that, as the Navasky court \nput it, the materials sought must โlogically fall into the categories of โintelligence sources and \nmethods.โโ  Navasky, 499 F. Supp. 2d at 274.  There can be no dispute on this issue in the instant \ncase.  As the Supreme Court held in Sims, the Governmentโs discretion to determine what would \nconstitute an unauthorized disclosure of intelligence and methods is โvery broad.โ  CIA v. Sims, \n471 U.S. 159, 168-169. (1985).  The Government has repeatedly stated, and its declarations \ndemonstrate, that the Report describes an intelligence collection operation authorized by Section \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 25 of 33\n \n215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  See Unclass. Bradley Decl. ยถ 9, Supp. Bradley Decl. ยถ 9, Class. \nBradley Decl.  Even without the benefit of the Governmentโs classified filing, it is clear that an \nintelligence collection operation by definition describes intelligence sources and methods, which \nfall within the protection of Section 102A of the National Security Act and Exemption 3.3  \nFurthermore, as explained in Part I (B)(2), supra, the Reportโs description of a classified \nintelligence collection operation does not contain any โabstract legal analysis.โ  See Supp. \nBradley Decl. ยถ 9.  To the extent any portion of the Report could be characterized as legal \nanalysis at all, such analysis is inextricably intertwined with information regarding legitimately \nshielded intelligence sources and methods.  See id.  \nIII.  THE CONCEPT OF โSECRET LAWโ IS NOT APPLICABLE IN THE \nCONTEXT OF EXEMPTIONS 1 OR 3  \nDespite plaintiffsโ ominous invocation of the specter of โsecret lawโ in this case, the \nconcept of โsecret law,โ also referred to as an agencyโs โworking law,โ4 is simply not applicable \nhere, where the Government is relying solely on Exemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the Report in \nfull.  The crux of plaintiffsโ argument is that once information is labeled โsecret law,โ it may not \nbe withheld even when one of the nine FOIA exemptions would otherwise apply.  But this \nmisrepresents a body of FOIA law on this subject stretching back over three decades; โsecret \n                                                 \n3 The plaintiffs also complain that the Government did not claim Exemption 3 until \nlitigation began.  But the Government does not waive the right to assert an exemption simply \nbecause the agency has not asserted it at the administrative level.  See Adamowicz v. IRS, 552 F. \nSupp. 2d 355, 361 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). \n4  The terms โsecret lawโ and โworking lawโ are used interchangeably by the courts.  See, \ne.g., Assembly of California v. United States Department of Commerce, 968 F.2d 916, 920 (9th \nCir. 1992) (โExemption 5 cases contrast agency documents leading to a decision with documents \nexplaining or interpreting a decision after the fact.  Because an agencyโs interpretations of its \ndecisions often become the โworking lawโ of the agency, documents deemed โpost decisionalโ do \nnot enjoy the protection of the deliberative process privilege.  This insures that the agency does \nnot operate on the basis of โsecret law.โโ (citations omitted)). \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 26 of 33\n \nlawโ is manifestly not a carve-out that trumps all FOIA exemptions.  Rather, the term โsecret \nlawโ arises primarily in the context of Exemption 5 and addresses the Governmentโs invocation \nof the deliberative process privilege to justify the withholding of information; in such cases, \ncourts consider whether a document is truly deliberative or whether the document is effectively \noperating as the agencyโs โworking law.โ  Plaintiffs do not cite a single case, nor is the \nGovernment aware of any case, in which a court has even mentioned the term โsecret lawโ as \npart of its analysis of Exemptions 1 or 3.  Instead, plaintiffs have cherry-picked quotes that \nincorporate the phrase โsecret law,โ often in dicta, from cases analyzing the withholding of \ndocuments under Exemptions 5 and the no longer extant Exemption High 2, and employ these \nout of context quotes in an attempt to shoehorn the facts of this case into a wholly inapplicable \nframework.   \nA.  The Concept of โSecret Lawโ Arises in the Context of Exemption 5  \nThe contours of the โsecret lawโ or โworking lawโ concept have been defined primarily \nin the context of whether the information in a document is predecisional and deliberative, and \ntherefore protected from disclosure under Exemption 5.5  Specifically, the term describes a \nparticular type of agency rule or procedure embodied in a non-public document, which has in \n                                                 \n5  There is also a line of cases that refer to the term โsecret lawโ in connection with the \nnow defunct FOIA exemption known as โHigh 2,โ which allowed agencies to withhold  \ninformation the release of which would risk circumvention of regulations or statutes.  See \nCrooker v. ATF, 670 F.2d 1051, 1074 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (en banc), overruled by Milner v. \nDepartment of Navy, 131 S. Ct. 1259 (2011).  Generally, in these cases courts either allowed the \ninformation to be withheld under High 2, distinguishing it, often in dicta, from the type of \nโsecret lawโ that is incompatible with the concepts of open government that FOIA advances, see, \ne.g., Caplan v. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco & Firearms, 587 F.2d 544, 548 (2d Cir. 1978), or \nfind that the information at issue does not fit within the boundaries of High 2, and labeling it \nโsecret lawโ without any sort of separate โsecret lawโ analysis, see, e.g., Jordan v. DOJ, 591 \nF.2d 753, 763-771; cf. Cuneo v. Schlesinger, 484 F.2d 1086, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (noting that it \nwas unclear whether the withheld information contained โsecret lawโ and remanding for the \nGovernment to provide additional  justification for its withholdings pursuant to Exemptions 2 \nand 5).   \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 27 of 33\n \npractice lost its predecisonal and deliberative character, and which could have an impact on the \nsubstantive or procedural rights of individual persons.  The D.C. Circuit has explained that \nโworking lawโ means โthose policies or rules, and the interpretations thereof, that either create or \ndetermine the extent of the substantive rights and liabilities of a person,โ Afshar v. Department of \nState, 702 F.2d 1125, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), i.e., \nthose policies and rules that a private party may have cause to rely on to guide his or her conduct.  \nSee also, e.g., Coastal States Gas Corp.v. Depโt of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 869 (D.C. Cir. 1980) \n(โworking lawโ or โsecret lawโ consists of agency guidance or precedent applied by agency staff \nin their dealings with the public); PHE, Inc. v. DOJ, 983 F.2d 248, 252 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (secret \nlaw is โmaterials that define standards for determining whether the law has been violatedโ).  \nSimilarly, the Second Circuit has defined โworking lawโ as โthe reasons which [] supply the \nbasis for an agency policy actually adopted.โ  Natโl Council of La Raza, 411 F.3d 350, 360 (2d \nCir. 2005) (quoting NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 152 (1975)). 6    \nThis conception of secret law makes sense in the context of Exemption 5, and specifically \nthe deliberative process privilege, because it helps to distinguish between the types of \n                                                 \n6 Even if the Report had been withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege \nunder Exemption 5, which as simple matter of fact it was not, the Report would not fall within \nthis definition of secret or working law.  As described in Part I, supra, the Report at issue \naddresses intelligence activities authorized by the FISA Court and conducted pursuant to a public \nstatute with the knowledge of and oversight by Congress.  It does not provide the reasons or \nโbasis for an agency policy actually adopted,โ La Raza, 411 F.3d at 360, nor does it โcreate or \ndetermine the extent of the substantive rights and liabilities of a person,โ  Afshar, 702 F.2d at \n1141, that such a person might rely on to guide his or her conduct.  Plaintiffs have cited no case, \nand the Government is not aware of any case, which would provide any support whatsoever for \ncharacterizing a report to Congress describing a specific court-authorized and congressionally \noverseen intelligence operation conducted pursuant to a public statute as an agencyโs โsecret \nlaw.โ  But in any event, the Government has not claimed Exemption 5 as a basis for withholding \nthe Report, and even if it had, as set forth in Part IV, B, infra, the Report would still be properly \nwithheld under Exemptions 1 and 3. See Sears, 421 U.S. at 161.  \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 28 of 33\n \ncommunications that are entitled to the protections of the privilege, i.e., non-final deliberations, \nand communications that are not.  Under the deliberative process privilege, the Government is \nable to withhold predecisional and deliberative documents in order to โprevent injury to the \nquality of agency decisions,โ but cannot withhold โcommunications made after the decision and \ndesigned to explain it.โ  Sears, 421 U.S. at 151, 152.  The Supreme Court defined the latter as the \nagencyโs โworking law,โ because โit is difficult to see how the quality of a decision will be \naffected by communications with respect to the decision occurring after the decision is finally \nreached,โ and โthe public is vitally concerned with the reasons which [] suppl[ied] the basis for \nan agency policy actually adopted.โ  Id.  See also Sterling Drug Inc. v. FTC, 450 F.2d 698, 708 \n(D.C. Cir. 1971) (finding non-public final FTC decision memorandum not comprised of โthe \nideas and theories which go into the making of the law, they are the law itself, and as such they \nshould be made available to the public. . . . to prevent the development of secret law within the \nCommissionโ).   In other words, the concept of โsecret lawโ arises in the context of Exemption 5 \nbecause withholding such information is not compatible with the underlying purpose of the \ndeliberative process privilegeโto help ensure โthe quality of agency decisions by preserving and \nencouraging candid discussion between officials.โ  La Raza, 411 F.3d at 356.  \nPlaintiffs misrepresent the law, however, by suggesting that in addition to an analysis of \nthe relevant exemption itself, there is a separate โsecret lawโ analysis, or a โsecret lawโ \nexclusion, that would trump the otherwise valid invocation of a FOIA exemption.  See ACLUโs \nMemorandum of Law in Opposition to the Governmentโs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nand in Support of Its Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (โACLU Br.โ) at 9 (the \nReport โcomprises secret law, and thus cannot be withheld as classifiedโ), 13-16; NY Times Br. \nat 20.  But there is no blanket carve-out from FOIAโs nine exemptions.  As the Supreme Court \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 29 of 33\n \nhas explained, โevery document generated by an agency is available to the public in one form or \nanother, unless it falls within one of the [FOIAโs] nine exemptions.โ  Sears, 421 U.S. at 136 \n(emphasis added).  Thus, in a FOIA case, the only relevant inquiry as to whether a document \nmust be disclosed is whether that document properly falls within the scope of one of those nine \nexemptions.   Indeed, plaintiffs have not cited a single case in which a court has found that a \ndocument that otherwise could have been withheld pursuant to one of the nine FOIA exemptions \nmust instead be disclosed because it constitutes โsecret law.โ  Rather, in the cases cited by \nplaintiffs, the courtsโ decisions as to whether the documents at issue were required to be \ndisclosed turned on those courtsโ analyses of the specific requirements of the particular \nexemption claimedโExemption 5 or the now defunct Exemption High 2.   \nFor example, in La Raza, the Second Circuit did not find that, notwithstanding the \napplicability of Exemption 5, the Office of Legal Counsel memorandum at issue should be \ndisclosed because it was secret law.  Rather, the Court found that the Government had \nimproperly invoked Exemption 5 based on the deliberative process privilege.  As the Court \nexplained, the memorandum could not be withheld as privileged because it lost its predecisional \ncharacter once it was adopted by the agency, and thus was effectively operating as the agencyโs \nworking law.  La Raza, 411 F.3d at 356, 360.  See also Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Mgmt & \nBudget, 598 F.3d 865, 875 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (holding Exemption 5 inapplicable because \ndocument reflecting OMB policy on how it carries out its responsibilities not predecisional or \ndeliberative and thus โfit comfortably within the working law frameworkโ).       \nIn none of these cases did the courts conduct anything akin to plaintiffsโ suggested \nโsecret lawโ analysisโthat is, apply โsecret lawโ as a freestanding rationale to require disclosure \nunder FOIA.  Rather, the courts โlook[]to the need to prevent accumulation of secret law as \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 30 of 33\n \nadditional support for the independent conclusion that postdecisional memoranda should be \nreleased because their publication would not interfere with the consultative process of \ngovernment decisionmaking,โ Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1142 (describing the Supreme Courtโs \ndecision in Sears), or to distinguish the document at issue from secret or working law.  See, e.g., \nCaplan, 587 F.2d at 548 (clarifying that the law enforcement manual at issue is not secret law \nand meets requirements of High 2 exemption).  See also, e.g., Jordan, 591 F.2d at 781-782 \n(Judge Bazelon providing three-paragraph concurring opinion discussing dangers of secret law \nfollowing 25-page majority opinion providing detailed analysis explaining why Exemptions 2 \nand 5 were inapplicable); Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 670 F.2d 1051, \n1118 n.117 (Wilkey, J., dissenting) (โJudge Bazelon joined the opinion of the court [in Jordan] \nwithout stating any reservations whatsoever about its rationale.  His decision to make some \nadditional comments did not diminish the meaning of his adherence to the majority opinion.โ).  \nAccordingly, the only legal analysis relevant to the holding in the cases cited by Plaintiffs is \nwhether the claimed FOIA exemptionโExemption 5 or Exemption High 2โapplies.   \nB.  There Is No Legal or Logical Connection Between the Concept of โSecret \nLawโ and Exemptions 1 or 3  \nNor is there any reason to extend the โsecret lawโ concept to Exemptions 1 or 3.  Despite \nplaintiffsโ attempts to conflate the meaning of the word โsecretโ in the phrase โsecret lawโ with \nthe use of the word โsecretโ for national security purposes, see, e.g., ACLU Br. at 1 (โthe Court \nshould reject the governmentโs attempt to keep secret its legal interpretation of Section 215โ), the \nconcept of โsecret lawโ as defined in the case law described above is completely separate and \ndistinct from national security information that has been classified as โsecretโ or โtop secretโ in \naccordance with the Executive Order 13526.  The Government has not invoked Exemption 5 in \nthis case, and is relying solely on Exemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the Report in full.  While the \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 31 of 33\n \nwithholding of โsecret lawโ is not compatible with the underlying purpose of the deliberative \nprocess privilege, it is wholly irrelevant to the underlying purpose of both Exemption 1, which is \nto withhold information the disclosure of which would cause harm to national security, and \nExemption 3, which โpermits government agencies to maintain the secrecy of information that is \nspecifically exempted from disclosure by certain statutes.โ  Berman v. CIA, 501 F.3d 1136, 1140 \n(9th Cir. 2007) (internal citations omitted).  In this case, the statute that exempts the Report from \ndisclosure pursuant to Exemption 3 is the National Security Act, which requires the Government \nto protect intelligence sources and methods.  50 U.S.C. ยง 403-1.  There is no inherent \ncontradiction between the withholding of an agencyโs working law and the need to protect \nclassified information.  In other words, a document could in theory fall squarely within the \ndefinition of secret or working law as defined in the context of Exemption 5, but still be \nclassified โsecretโ or โtop secretโ in order to prevent harm to national security.  There is also no \ninherent contradiction in the withholding of an agencyโs working law and the Governmentโs \nneed to protect intelligence sources and methods.     \nTo find otherwise would turn FOIA analysis on its head, and would in effect allow the \ndisclosure of information despite a courtโs own acknowledgement that to do so would cause the \nnational security harm and expose sensitive intelligence sources and methods.  However, the law \nis clear that โ[t]he Courtโs role with regard to Exemption 1 is only to review the sufficiency and \nreasonableness of the agency's explanation for its classification decision, giving the agency's \ndetermination the heightened deference it is due under the law.โ People for the Am. Way Fund. v. \nNSA, 462 F. Supp. 2d 21, 33 (D.D.C.  2006).   See also ACLU v. DOJ, 265 F. Supp. 2d  20, 31 \n(D.D.C. 2003) (โThat the public has a significant and entirely legitimate desire for th[e] \ninformation simply does not, in an Exemption 1 case, alter the analysis.โ);  Wilner, 592 F.3d at \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 32 of 33\n \n72 (โExemption 3 differs from other FOIA exemptions in that its applicability depends less on \nthe detailed factual contents of specific documents; the sole issue for decision is the existence of \na relevant statute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statuteโs coverageโ) (internal \ncitations omitted) .   \nPlaintiffs provide no support for the proposition that if a document could be considered \nsecret or working law, the protections of Exemptions 1 and 3 are no longer available.    To the \ncontrary, the Supreme Court has noted explicitly that if a document constitutes working law and \ntherefore cannot be withheld under Exemption 5, it โmay be withheld only on the ground that it \nfalls within the coverage of some exemption other than Exemption 5.โ  Sears, 421 U.S. at 161.  \nSee also Tax Analysts v. IRS, 294 F.3d 71, 76 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (โthe District Court correctly \ndetermined that IRS need not segregate and release agency working law from TAs withheld in \ntheir entirety pursuant to the attorney work product privilegeโ).   \nAccordingly, the only relevant analysis in this case is whether Exemptions 1 and 3 in fact \napply.  As set forth above and in the Governmentโs opening brief, because the Report is indeed \ncurrently and properly classified, Exemption 1 authorizes its withholding.  Also as set forth \nabove and in the Governmentโs opening brief, because the Report contains intelligence sources \nand methods, it is exempt from disclosure under the National Security Act and Exemption 3 \nauthorizes its withholding. There is simply no basis for also conducting a separate analysis to \ndetermine whether the Report fits into the framework of โsecret lawโ as understood in the \ncontext of the deliberative process privilege under Exemption 5.   \n   \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-06990-WHP   Document 23    Filed 04/23/12   Page 33 of 33\n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Governmentโs motion for summary judgment in The New York Times Co. v.

PAULEY III, District Judge: \nPlaintiffs The New York Times Company and Charlie Savage (together, the \"New \nYork Times\") and the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union \nFoundation (together, the \"ACLU\") bring these actions against the United States Department of \nJustice (the \"DOJ\") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the \"FBI,\" collectively, the \n\"Government\") under the Freedom ofInforrnation Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 U.S.C. ยง 552.  The New \nYork Times and the ACLU seek the public disclosure of a classified report to Congress from the \n-1-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 2 of 14\nAttorney General and the Director ofNational Intelligence (the \"Report\") regarding foreign \nintelligence collection authorized by section 215 ofthe USA PATRIOT Act (the \"Patriot Act\"). \nThe parties move for summary judgment in 11 Civ. 6990 (the \"New York Times action\") and \npartial summary judgment in 11 Civ. 7562 (the \"ACLU action\").  For the following reasons, \nPlaintiffs' motions are denied, and the Government's motions are granted. \nBACKGROUND \n1.  Patriot Act Section 215 \nSection 215 ofthe Patriot Act authorizes the Government to apply to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court for an order directing the production of\"any tangible things\" for \ncertain investigations.  50 U.S.c. ยง 1861(a)(1).  The Government contends that its use ofthis \nauthority is critical to countering national security threats.  It represents that public disclosure of \nthe Report would expose sensitive intelligence sources and methods to America's adversaries \nand therefore harm national security. \nIn response, the New York Times and the ACLU note that two United States \nSenators-Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator Mark Udall of Colorado-stated publicly \nthat the Executive Branch misled Congress and the American public about its broad \ninterpretation of section 215.  See 157 Congo Rec. S3386 (daily ed. May 26,2011) (statement of \nSen. Wyden) (\"[M]any Members of Congress have no idea how the law is being secretly \ninterpreted by the executive branch[.]\"); see also 157 Congo Rec. S3389 (daily ed. May 26,2011) \n(statement of Sen. Udall) (\"[W]hat most people-including many Members of Congressยญ\nbelieve the PATRIOT Act allows the government to do ... and what government officials \n-2-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 3 of 14\nprivately believe the PATRIOT Act allows them to do are two different things.\").  According to \nthe New York Times and the ACLU, the Senators' comments suggest that the Government is \nwithholding the Report in bad faith. \nII.  The New York Times Request \nOn May 27,2011, New York Times reporter Charlie Savage (\"Savage\") \nsubmitted a FOIA request to the DOJ's Office ofInformation Policy (\"OIP\") sr.eking the Report. \n(Declaration ofNabiha Syed, dated Mar. 19,2012 (\"Syed Decl.\"), Ex. B.)  On June 22, 2011, \nSavage forwarded the request to the DOl's National Security Division (\"NSD\").  (Syed Decl. ~ 4 \nand Ex. B.)  On August 2,2011, NSD denied Savage's request.  (Syed Decl. ~ 9 and Ex. D.)  On \nAugust 19,2011, the New York Times appealed the denial to OIP.  (Syed Decl. ~ 11 and Ex. E.) \nOn October 5, 2011-after the deadline for an administrative determination on the appeal \npassed-the New York Times commenced this litigation.  (Syed Decl. ~ 17.) \nBy letter dated September 30, 201 I-but received by the New York Times after \nthe commencement ofthis litigation-OIP informed the New York Times that the Report was \nproperly withheld, but the DOJ Department Review Committee would determine whether it \nshould remain classified.  (Syed Decl. ~ 19 and Ex. I.) According to the Government, such \nreferrals to the Review Committee occur as a matter ofcourse.  (Letter from Emily Daughtry to \nthe Court, dated May 8,2012) (11 Civ. 6990, ECF No. 25.) \nIII.  THE ACLU REQUEST \nOn May 31, 2011, the ACLU filed a FOIA request with the FBI and the DOl's \nOIP, Office ofPublic Affairs, Office ofLegal Counsel, and NSD seeking \"all records concerning \nthe government's interpretation or use of Section 215.\"  (Unclassified Declaration ofMark A. \n-3ยญ\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 4 of 14\nBradley, dated Feb. 27, 2012 (\"Unclassified Bradley Decl.\"), ,  7.)  On August 22, 2011, NSD \nreleased three documents in response to the request and stated that it would withhold other \ndocuments, including the Report sought by the New York Times.  (Complaint, dated Oct. 26, \n2011 (\"ACLU Compl.\"), ~ 6.)  After filing and losing two administrative appeals, the ACLU \nfiled this suit on October 26,2011.  (ACLU Compl. ~~ 38-44.)  The ACLU's other FOIA \nrequests are not before the Court on these motions. \nDISCUSSION \n1.  Legal Standard \nSummary judgment should be rendered if the record shows that \"there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). \nThe burden ofdemonstrating the absence of any genuine dispute as to a material fact rests with \nthe moving party.  See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970).  Once the \nmoving party has made an initial showing that there is no genuine dispute ofmaterial fact, the \nnon-moving party cannot rely on the \"mere existence ofa scintilla of evidence\" to defeat \nsummary judgment but must set forth \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) (emphasis in \noriginal); see also Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Jones Chern., Inc., 315 F.3d 171, 175 (2d \nCir.2003). \n\"A dispute about a 'genuine issue' exists for summary judgment purposes where \nthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the non-movant's favor.\"  Beyer v. \n-4ยญ\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 5 of 14\nCnty. ofNassau, 524 F.3d 160, 163 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Guilbert v. Gardner, 480 F.3d 140, \n145 (2d Cir. 2007).  \"Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to \nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial. '\" Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, \n380 (2007) (citing Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586-87).  The Court resolves all factual ambiguities \nand draws all inferences in favor ofthe non-moving party.  Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255; see \nalso Jeffreys v. City ofNew York, 426 F.3d 549,553 (2d Cir. 2005).  Where, as here, both \nparties move for summary judgment, each party's motion \"must be examined on its own merits, \nand in each case all reasonable inferences must be drawn against the party whose motion is under \nconsideration.\"  Morales v. Quintel Entm't, Inc., 249 F.3d 115, 121 (2d Cir. 2001). \nIn a FOIA case, \"[a]ffidavits and declarations ... giving reasonably detailed \nexplanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption [from the cbligation to \ndisclose] are sufficient to sustain the agency's burden.\" Carney v. U.S. Dep't ofJustice, 19 F.3d \n807,812 (2d Cir. 1994) (footnote omitted).  \"[T]he general rule in this Circuit is that in FOIA \nactions, agency affidavits alone will support a grant ofsummary judgment,\" and Local Civil \nRule 56.1 statements are not required.  Ferguson v. FBI, No. 89 Civ. 5071 (RPP), 1995 WL \nยท329307, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 1995), aff'd, 83 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 1996). \nII.  FOIA \nFOIA represents Congress's balance \"between the right ofthe public to know and \nthe need of the Government to keep information in confidence.\" John Doe Agency v. John Doe \nCorp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989) (quoting H.R. Rep. 89-1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1966ยป \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, while FOIA requires public disclosure ofmany \ngovernment documents, disclosure is not required if\"the documents fall within [the statute's] \n-5ยญ\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 6 of 14\nenumerated exceptions.\" Dep't ofInterior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n, 532 U.S. 1, \n8 (2001) (internal citations omitted).  FOIA's exemptions are \"narrowly construed,\" and all \ndoubts \"are to be resolved in favor ofdisclosure.\"  ACLU v. Dep't ofDer., 543 F.3d 59, 66 (2d \nCir. 2008), vacated on other grounds and remanded, 130 S. Ct. 777 (2009). \nCourts review exemption claims de novo, and it is the Government's burden \"to \njustify the withholding of any requested documents.\" Associated Press v. U.S. Dep't ofDer., \n554 F.3d 274, 283 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting U.S. Dep't ofState v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 173 (1991ยป \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  To carry its burden, the \nGovernment must submit declarations with the \"reasonable specificity\" needed to facilitate \nmeaningful review.  Halpern v. FBI, 181 F.3d 279,293 (2d Cir. 1999).  However, declarations in \nFOIA cases need not contain \"factual descriptions that ifmade public would compromise the \nsecret nature of the information[.]\" Hayden v. Nat'l Sec. Agency/Cent. Sec. Serv., 608 F.2d \n1381, 1384-85 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (quoting Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820,826 (D.C. Cir. 1973ยป \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"Ultimately, an agency's justification for invoking a FOIA exception is sufficient \nif it appears logical or plausible.\" Wilner v. Nat'! Sec. Agency, 592 F.3d 60, 73 (2d Cir. 2009) \n(quoting Larson v. Dep't of State, 565 F.3d 857,865 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Sentelle, c.J.ยป  (internal \nquotation marks omitted).

U.S. Dep't ofDer., \n628 F.3d 612,624 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (Sentelle, C.J.); accord Amnesty Int'l USA v.

Sufficiency ofthe Government's Submissions \nIn support ofits motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment, \nthe Government submitted classified and unclassified declarations ofMark A. Bradley, the \nDirector ofthe FOIA and Declassification Unit ofNSD's Office ofLaw and Policy. \n(Unclassified Bradley Decl. '1[ 1.)  The New York Times and the ACLU contend that the \nunclassified Bradley declaration lacks the required degree ofspecificity because it is conclusory \nand merely repeats the legal standard for withholding classified documents.  But, as the New \nYork Times acknowledged at oral argument, this Court need not decide whether the \nGovernment's public submissions are sufficient ifthis Court reviewed the Report in camera. \n(Hearing Transcript dated May 4,2012 (\"Hr'g Tr.\"), at 12.) Any in camera inspection guides a \ncourt's evaluation ofthe Government's reliance on exemptions from FOIA's disclosure \nrequirement. \nB.  In Camera Review \nDistrict courts may review withheld documents in camera to assist in analyzing \nFOIA exemption claims.  See 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B); see also Tigue v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, \n312 F 3d 70, 82 (2d Cir. 2002).  \"In camera review is considered the exception, not the rule, and \nthe propriety ofsuch review is a matter entrusted to the district court's discretion.\"  ACLU v. \nOffice ofthe Dir. ofNaCI Intelligence, No. 10 Civ. 4419 (RJS), 2011 WL 5563520, at *12 n.9 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15,2011) (quoting Local 3, InCI Bhd. ofElec. Workers v. NLRB, 845 F.2d \n1177, 1180 (2d Cir. 1988ยป  (internal quotation marks omitted).  But in camera inspection is \n-7-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 8 of 14\nparticularly appropriate where, as here, \"the number ofdocuments is relatively small[.]\"  Twist \nv. Ashcroft, 329 F. Supp. 2d 50, 54 (D.D.C. 2004), affd sub nom., Twist v. Gonzales, 171 F. \nApp'x 855 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \nBoth the New York Times and the ACLU asked this to Court review the Report in \ncamera, and the Government did not oppose that request.  In view ofthe Report's brevity, this \nCourt did so.  This Court is mindful, however, that \"the district court's inspection prerogative is \nnot a substitute for the government's burden ofproofl.]\" Halpern, 181 F.3d at 295 (quoting \nChurch ofScientology v. U.S. Dep't of Army. 611 F.2d 738, 743 (9th Cir. 1980)) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, the Government must demonstrate that the Report is \ncovered by at least one ofFOIA's enumerated exemptions.  See Wilner, 592 F.3d at 73. \nC.  FOIA Exemption 1 \nThe Government contends that the Report is exempt from disclosure under FOIA \nExemption 1.  Exemption 1 provides that FOIA's disclosure mandate does not apply to materials \nthat are \"(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept \nsecret in the interest ofnational defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified \npursuant to such Executive order.\"  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(1). \nExecutive Order 13526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707 (Dec. 29,2009), provides the operative \nclassification standard.  Under this Executive Order, (1) an \"original classification authority\" \nmust classify the information; (2) the information must be \"owned by, produced by or for, or ... \nunder the control ofthe United States Government\"; (3) the information must fall within one or \nmore ofeight protected categories listed in section 1.4 ofthe Order; and (4) an original \nclassification authority must \"determine[] that the unauthorized disclosure ofthe information \n-8ยญ\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 9 of 14\nreasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security\"  and be \"able to \nidentify and describe the damage.\"  Exec. Order 13526 ยง L1(a)(1)-(a)(4).  Section 1,4 of \nExecutive Order 13526 protects, among other things, \"intelligence activities (including covert \naction), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology,\" and \"vulnerabilities or capabilities of \nsystems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the \nnational security.\"  However, Section 1.7 prohibits classification ofinformation in order to \n\"prevent or delay the release ofinformation that does not require protection in the interest of \nnational security.\"  Exec. Order 13526 ยง L7(a)(4). \nThe New York Times and the ACLU do not dispute that the first two conditions \nfor classification are met.  Further, the Bradley declarations show that the Government \n\"determine[ d] that the unauthorized disclosure ofthe information reasonably could be expected \nto result in damage to the national security.\"  Exec. Order 13526 ยง 1.1( a)(4).  F1nally, this \nCourt's in camera review confirms that the Report falls within at least one ofthe eight categories \nlisted in section 1,4.  This Court agrees that the Report \"contains specific descriptions ofthe \nmanner and means by which the United States Government acquires tangible things for certain \nauthorized investigations pursuant to Section 215.\" (Unclassified Bradley Decl. ~ 9.)  And this \nCourt credits the Government's assertion that disclosing this information could enable America's \nadversaries to develop means to degrade and evade the nation's foreign intelligence collection \ncapabilities.  (Unclassified Bradley DecL ~ 9.) Accordingly, FOIA Exemption 1 applies, and the \nGovernment need not disclose the Report. \n-9-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 10 of 14\nD. \t FOIA Exemption 3 \nThe Government also contends that the Report is exempt from disclosure under \nFOIA Exemption 3, which provides that materials \"specifically exempted from disclosure\" by \ncertain statutes need not be disclosed.  5 U.S.c. ยง 552(b )(3).  In evaluating whether Exemption 3 \napplies, a court should \"not closely scrutinize the contents ofthe withheld document; instead, [it \nshould] determine only whether there is a relevant statue and whether the document falls within \nthat statute.\" Krikorian v. Dep't ofState, 984 F.2d 461, 465 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \nThe Government argues that disclosure ofthe Report is barred by the National \nSecurity Act of 1947, as amended by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004, which protects intelligence sources and methods.  See 50 U.S.c. ยง 403-1(i).  In enacting \nthe National Security Act, Congress \"simply and pointedly protected all sources ofintelligence \nthat provide, or are engaged to provide, information the [responsible agency] needs to perform its \nstatutory duties[.]\" CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 169-70 (1985). \nThis Court's in camera review confirms that disclosing the Report would reveal \nand potentially compromise intelligence sources and methods.  And it is principally the duty of \nthe Executive Branch, \"not that ofthe judiciary, to weigh the variety ofcomplex and subtle \nfactors in determining whether disclosure ofinformation may lead to an unacceptable risk of \ncompromising the [Government's] intelligence-gathering process.\" Sims, 471 U.S. at 180. \nAccordingly, the Report is also exempt from disclosure under the National Security Act of 1947, \n50 U.S.C. ยง 403-1(i), and FOIA Exemption 3,5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(3). \n-10-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 11 of 14\nE.  \"Secret Law\" \nIn addition to arguing that Exemptions 1 and 3 do not apply, the ACLU contends \nthat the so-called secret law doctrine mandates the disclosure ofthe Report.  The ACLU argues \nthat even ifthe Report is covered by Exemptions 1 or 3, the Government may not withhold it to \nthe extent that it \"sets forth or clarifies an agency's substantive or procedurallaw[.]\" Caplan v. \nBureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 587 F.2d 544,548 (2d Cir. 1978) (citation omitted); see \nalso Jordan v. U.S. Dep't ofJustice, 591 F.2d 753, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (Bazelon, J., concurring) \n(\"One ofthe principal purposes of[FOIA] is to eliminate 'secret law.\"').  While the New York \nTimes joins this argument, it clarifies that the ultimate issue is whether the FOIA exemptions \napply.  (Hr'g Tr. at 22-23.) \nTo support their \"secret law\" theory, the New York Times and the ACLU cite no \ncase in which a court applied the \"secret law doctrine\" to mandate the disclosure of classified \nnational security information protected by Exemptions 1 or 3, and this Court has found none. \nIndeed, the concept of\"secret law\" arose in the different context ofExemption 5-which \nprotects certain \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters,\" 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5}ยญ\nand the now-abrogated exemption known as \"High 2,\" which shielded \"'predominantly internal' \nmaterials whose disclosure would 'significantly ris[k] circumvention of agency regulations or \nstatutes.'\"  Milner v. Dep't ofNavy, l3l S. Ct. 1259, 1263 (2011)(quoting Crooker v. Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 670 F.2d 1051, 1056-57, 1074 (D.C. Cir. 1981ยป  (internal citation \nomitted); see also Afshar v. Dep't ofState, 702 F.2d 1125, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Cuneo v. \nSchlesinger, 484 F.2d 1086, 1090-91 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  Further, there is no textual basis in FOIA \nfor a freestanding \"secret law doctrine.\" Notwithstanding the ACLU's policy arguments, this \n-11-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 12 of 14\nCourt declines the invitation to read a \"secret law\" exception into the FOIA exemptions without \na statutory tether.  See Ali v. Fed. Bureau ofPrisons, 552 U.S. 214,228 (2008) (\"[Courts] must \ngive effect to the text congress enacted[.]\"); see also Milner, 131 S. Ct. at 1267 (rejecting a \"textยญ\nlight approach\" to interpreting FOIA).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs' \"secret law\" argument is \nunavailing. \nF.  Evidence of Bad Faith \nIn challenging the adequacy of the Government's submissions, the New York \nTimes and the ACLU contend that the statements ofSenators Wyden and Udall raise the \npossibility that the Government's decision to withhold the Report reflects bad faith.  See Wilner, \n592 F.3d at 73 (explaining that evidence ofbad faith can undermine agency's a3sertions that \ndocument falls within FOIA exemption).  However, this Court's in camera review ofthe Report \nverifies the Government's public representations that the Report contains properly classified \nnational security information.  The Senators' concerns that the Government is misleading \nCongress and the public about the scope of section 215 do not compel a different conclusion \nbecause the Government meets its burden for withholding the Report under Exemptions 1 and 3. \nG.  Feasibility of Redactions \nThe New York Times and the ACLU maintain that this Court should order the \nGovernment to produce the Report in redacted form ifportions are exempt from disclosure.  As \nthey note, any portions ofa document that fall outside ofFOIA's exemptions must be disclosed \nunless they are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the exempt material.  Inner City Press/Cmty. on \nthe Move v. Bd. ofGovernors ofthe Fed. Reserve Sys., 463 F.3d 239, 249 n.10 (2d Cir. 2006). \nThis Court's in camera review reveals that any potentially non-exempt portions ofthe Report are \n-12-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 31    Filed 05/17/12   Page 13 of 14\ninextricably intertwined with the exempt portions.  Accordingly, the entire Report is exempt \nfrom disclosure under FOIA Exemptions I and 3.  The disclosure of a redacted version ofthe \nReport is neither feasible nor warranted. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the New York Times' motion for summary judgment \nand the ACLU's motion for partial summary judgment are denied.  The Government's motions \nfor summary judgment in the New York Times action and for partial summary judgment in the \nACLU action are granted. \nThe Clerk ofthe Court is directed to file this Memorandum & Order in both 11 \nCiv. 6990 and 11 Civ. 7562.  The Clerk ofthe Court is further directed to terminate all pending \nmotions in 11 Civ. 6990 and mark that case closed, and to terminate the motions pending at ECF \nNos. 14 and 23 in 11 Civ. 7562. \nDated: May 17,2012 \nNew York, New York \nSO ORDERED: \n'''J \n~'Y.- ~ \n{:? \nWILLIAM H.

PAULEY III, District Judge: \nPlaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Libeliies Union \nFoundation (together, \"ACLU\"), filed this Freedom ofInfonnation Act action seeking \ndocuments relating to the Government's use of section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  After the \nACLU filed this case, an unprecedented national security leak led to widespread publication of \nclassified documents concerning section 215 and reshaped this litigation.  Both parties move for \nsummary judgment on the documents the Government has withheld.  For the following reasons, \nthe Government's motion is granted in part, and the ACLU's motion is denied in part.  The \nGovernment is directed to submit documents to this Court, and the remainder of the motions will \nbe decided following in camera inspection. \nBACKGROUND \nAfter the September 11 th attacks, Congress amended the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act to expand the Government's authority to investigate potential terror threats. \nSpecifically, section 215 ofthe USA PATRIOT Act authorized judges ofthe Foreign \n-1-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 2 of 18\nIntelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to order the \"production of any tangible things (including \nbooks, records, papers, documents, and other items)\" if certain statutory requirements are met. \nSee Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (2001) (codified at 50 U.S.C. ยง 1861). \nIn May 2011, the ACLU submitted a FOIA request to four agencies within the \nDepartment of Justice-the National Security Division, the Office of Information Policy, the \nOffice of Legal Counsel, and the FBI-seeking \"records concerning the Government's \ninterpretation or use of Section 215.\"  CompI. ~~ 22,28.  In August 2011, the Government \nresponded to the ACLU's request, releasing three documents in full and withholding others. \nIn October 2011, the ACLU filed this action challenging the Government's \nresponse.  The ACLU's FOIA request overlapped with a FOIA request by The New York Times \nthat sought a report to Congress from the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence \nconcerning the use of section 215.  See N.Y. Times Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 11 Civ. 6990 \n(WHP) (S.D.N.Y.).  The ACLU, The New York Times, and the Government all moved for \nsummary judgment with respect to that report.  After reviewing the report in camera, this Court \ngranted summary judgment for the Government.  N.Y. Times Co. v. Dep't of Justice, 872 F. \nSupp. 2d 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). \nFollowing that decision, the ACLU narrowed its FOIA request.  Later in 2012, the \nGovernment supplemented its initial production, releasing additional documents but continuing \nto withhold many others.  Early in 2013, the parties each moved for summary judgment with \nrespect to the withheld documents. \nThe posture of this action then changed dramatically.  On June 5, 2013, The \nGuardian published a classified FISC \"Secondary Order\" issued under section 215 directing \n-2-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 3 of 18\ntelecommunications provider Verizon to provide the National Security Agency \"on an ongoing \ndaily basis ... all call detail records or 'telephony metadata'\"  for all telephone calls on its \nnetwork from April 25, 2013 to July 19, 2013.  See lnre Application of the FBI for an Order \nRequiring the Prod. Of Tangible Things From Verizon Bus., Network Servs., Inc. ex reI. MCI \nCommc'n Servs., Inc. d/b/a Verizon Bus. Servs., No. BR 13-80, slip op. at 24 (F.I.S.C. Apr. 25, \n2013).  This document, leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, was the beginning \nof an \"unprecedented unauthorized disclosure of TOP SECRET documents,\" touching \"on some \nof the U.S. Government's most sensitive national security programs, including highly classified \nand on-going signals intelligence collection programs.\"  Hudson Decl. ~ 17 (emphasis in the \noriginal).  The Government acknowledged the existence of an NSA program that had been \ncollecting bulk telephony metadata-but not call contents-under section 215 since 2006.  See \nAdministration White Paner: Bulk Collection of Telenhon  J\\J!etadata Under Section 215 oftne \nT \nUSA PATRIOT ACT (Aug. 9,2013).1 \nThe Government asked this Court to defer decision on the pending summary \njudgment motions while it assessed the impact of Snowden's leaks.  Letter from AUSA John D. \nClopper, June 7, 2013 (ECF No. 62).  The President instructed the Director of National \nIntelligence to determine what information could be declassified in light of the unauthorized \ndisclosures.  Hudson Dec!. ~ 24; Executive Order 13526 ยง 3.1(c)-(d).  Thereafter, the \nGovernment began \"a large-scale, multi-agency review process\" to determine what additional \ninformation could be released.  Hudson Decl. ,-r 25.  In the course of that review, the Government \nreleased a redacted copy of the report that was the subject of this Court's decision in New York \nAvailable at http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents1750223/obama-administrations-legal-\n1 \nrationale-for. pdf. \n-3-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 4 of 18\nTimes Co., 872 F. Supp. 2d 309.  See 2011 Report on the National Security Agency's Bulk \nCollection Programs for USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization.2 \nAs the declassification process unfolded, the parties withdrew their summary \njudgment motions.  And in August 2013, this Court directed the Government to continue its \nreview process and make rolling productions to the ACLU.  ECF No. 71.  Ultimately, the \nGovernment released over 1,000 pages of material. \nIn February 2014, the ACLU narrowed its request again to \"fully withheld \nopinions or orders ofthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that relate to the bulk collection \nof any infonnation (i.e., not just telephony metadata).\"  Email from Patrick Toomey, Esq., Feb. \n7,2014 (Ex.

In addition to its \npublicly filed submissions to this Court, the Government also filed a classified ex parte \ndeclaration in support of its motion. \nDISCUSSION \n1.  FOIA \nCongress enacted FOIA to \"ensure an informed citizemy\" and to \"hold the \ngovernors accountable to the governed.\" NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, \n242 (1978).  FOlA requires \"broad disclosure of Government records.\"  CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. \n159, 166 (1985).  It strikes \"a \\vorkable balance bet\\veen the right of the public to kno\\v and the \nneed of the Government to keep information in confidence.\"  John Doe Agency v. John Doe \n.coIP-\"  493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989).  On request, the Govemmentmust disclose any document that \n-\n~ \ndoes not fall within one ofFOIA's nine exemptions,  See Dep't ofTnterior v, Klamath Water \nUsers Protective Ass'n, 532 U.S. 1, 7 (2001).  \"[T]hese limited exemptions do not obscure the \nbasic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.\"  Klamath, 532 \nU.S. at 7-8 (alteration in original) (quoting Dep't of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361 \n(1976ยป.  \"[C]onsistent with the Act's goal of broad disclosure, these exemptions have been \nconsistently given a narrow compass.\"  Klamath, 532 U.S. at 8 (quoting U.S. Dep't of Justice v. \nTax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 151 (1989ยป; see also FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630 (1982). \nEven if portions of documents are exempt from disclosure, the statute requires the \nGovernment to disclose \"[a]ny reasonably segregable portion.\"  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b).  \"[N]on-\nexempt portions of a document must be disclosed unless they are inextricably intertwined with \nexempt portions.\"  Sussman v.

In Camera Review \nA district court may review documents in camera to determine whether they are \nexempt under FOIA, and if so, whether any reasonably segregable portions may be released.  \"In \ncamera review is considered the exception, not the rule, and the propriety of such review is a \nmatter entrusted to the district court's discretion.\"  Local 3, Int'l Bhd. ofElec. Workers v. \nNLRB, 845 F.2d 1177, 1180 (2d Cir. 1988).  \"[I]f there is evidence of agency bad faith-for \nexample, if information contained in agency affidavits is contradicted by other evidence in the \nrecord-then, in camera inspection may be necessary to insure that agencies do not misuse the \n-6-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 7 of 18\nFOIA exemptions to conceal non-exempt information.\"  Carter v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce, 830 \nF.2d 388, 393 (D.C. Cir. 1987). \nIn support of its initial summary judgment motion, before the declassification \nreview, the Government argued the documents it withheld in full could not be released in \nredacted form because \"the release of any non-exempt information would produce only \nincomplete, fragmented, unintelligible sentences and phrases that are devoid of any meaning.\" \nDecL of Mark A. Bradley ~ 14 (ECF No. 43).  But the plaintiff in another FOIA litigation \nseeking many ofthe same documents at issue here aptly demonstrated how a FISC order \npreviously withheld but later released could have been redacted to remove classified material \nwhile still providing meaningful information.  Supplemental Dec!. of Charles E. Sims Exs. 2-A, \n2-B (ECF No. 99-2).  The withheld document concerned the Government's violations of an \nearlier FISC order.  The GovernrXlel1t could have redacted it to conceal the existence of a bulk \ncollection program, the NSA's involvement, and the type of information collected by the \nGovernment, but still reveal that the Government acted \"in a manner that appears to the Court to \nbe directly contrary\" to a previous court order, that the FISC contemplated taking \"action \nregarding persons responsible for any misrepresentations to the Court ... either through its \ncontempt powers or by referral to appropriate investigative offices,\" and that \"[t]he Court is \nexceptionally concerned about what appears to be a flagrant violation of its Order in this matter.\" \nSupplemental Sims Decl. Ex. 2-A.  These are by no means \"unintelligible sentences and phrases \nthat are devoid of any meaning.\"  Bradley Decl. ~ 14. \nAnd in its initial summary judgment motion, the Government also defended its \nwithholding of responsive documents by stating \"the rules and procedures of the FISC restrict \nthe Government from disclosing FISC records.\"  Second Supplemental Decl. of Mark A. Bradley \n-7-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 8 of 18\n~ 12 (ECF No. 55); see also Gov. Br. at 19 (ECF No. 95) (\"[T]he government previously \nwithheld in full all of the responsive FISC opinions and orders so as not to contravene the FISC's \nown rules and procedures.\").  In its present summary judgment motion, the Government \nacknowledges the FISC's rules do not prevent it from releasing FISC orders, but asserts its prior \nposition was held in good faith. \nAt first, the Government argued its \"mistaken\" understanding of the FISC rules \nwas corrected in September 2013, when the FISC \"clarified\" that its orders were subject to FOIA \nrequests.  See In re Orders of this Court Interpreting Section 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. \nbecause the Government itself previously declassified and released a FISC order on July 31, \n2013, six weeks before the September \"clarifying\" order.  See Office ofthe Director on,Tat'l \nIntelligence, \"D~JI Clapper Declassifies and P~eleases Telephone r\"1etadata Collection \nDocuments\" (July 31,2013)4, \nThen, the Government claimed it had erred and offered a new argument: it was a \nJune 2013 FISC order, not the one in September, that \"clarified\" the issue.  See In re Motion for \nConsent to Disclosure of Court Records or, in the Alternative, a Determination of the Effect of \nthe Court's Rules on Statutory Access Rights, No. Misc. 13-01 (F.I.S.C. June 12,2013).5  But \nthat contradicts the position the Government took in an earlier proceeding before the FISC. \nBack in 2007, the ACLU moved before the FISC for release of certain court \norders and pleadings.  In arguing that the motion was improper, the Government asserted that \n3 Available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%20l3-02%200rder-2.pdf. \n4 Available at http://1.usa.govllud7vjq. \n5 Available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%20l3-0 1%  200pinion-l.pdf. \n-8-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 9 of 18\n\"[t]he ACLU can use FOIA [] to seek access to FISC orders and Government briefs in the \nExecutive's possession.  The FOIA process ... is the proper means for the ACLU to seek \nrecords of[the FISC's] proceedings from the Executive Branch.  Moreover, FOIA'sjudicial \nremedies must be sought only in district court, not in [the FISC].\"  Gov.'s Opp. Br. at 5, In re \nMotion for Release of Court Records, No. Misc. 07-01 (F.I.S.C.).6  The FISC agreed with the \nGovernment.  In denying the ACLU's motion, in that court's first published opinion, the FISC \nheld \"nothing in this decision forecloses the ACLU from pursuing whatever remedies may be \navailable to it in a district court through a FOIA request addressed to the Executive Branch.\"  See \nIn fe Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484,497 (F.LS.C. 2007). \nHaving argued successfully in 2007 that FOIA was the proper vehicle to seek \nrelease of FISC documents, the Government appears to have been dissembling in 2012 when it \nargued \"the rules and procedures of the FISC restrict the Goverrmlent from disclosing FISC \nrecords.\"  Second Supplemental Decl. of Mark A. Bradley ~ 12 (ECF No. 55).  The same \nin~erence could be drawn from the Government's current argument that it did not know until \nJune 2013 that there was no such restriction on FOIA releases of FISC documents.  In short, the \nGovernment's arguments bear the hallmarks of opportunistic rummaging rather than a coherent \nstrategy. \nNevertheless, the Government contends it was still appropriate to withhold the \ndocuments in full because they \"included the identifier for communications intelligence or \n'COMINT,' which is an identifier for Sensitive Compartmented Information ('SCI') that is \nassociated with the NSA.\"  Gov. Op. Br at 17 (ECF No. 95).  The \"COMINT\" identifier would \n6 Available at http://bit.1yllnaXYtD. \n-9-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 10 of 18\nhave revealed the NSA's involvement with section 215, a classified fact at the time.  And \nredacting classification markings would have been unusual for DO] and permitted a \nsophisticated adversary to deduce the N8A's involvement.  See Gov. Opp. Br. at 16-18.  This \nobscure argument is particularly elusive.  Fortunately, it need not be addressed.7  It is enough \nthat by advancing incorrect and inconsistent arguments, the Government acted without the \ncandor this Court expects from it. \nAnd even after the declassification review, the Government continued to withhold \ndocuments from the ACLU.  The Government's updated Vaughn index contains an entry \ndescribed simply as \"~v1ultiple FISC Orders\" fiom ~v1arch 2006 to June 2011, vvith no information \non the number of documents in the category, their specific dates, or the content of the orders. \nHudson Decl. Ex. A.  The Government withheld the Multiple FISC Orders in full, as well as the \nnumber and dates ofthose orders, claiming \"no further information about the nature or substance \n[of the Multiple FISC Orders] can be provided without revealing classified information.\" \nHudson Decl. ~ 52.  But as the ACLU pointed out, the Government had already publicly \ndisclosed the docket numbers and dates of three orders not listed on the Vaughn index, as well as \nexcerpted text from two of them.  See Supplemental Sims Decl. Exs. 4, 5, & 7 (ECF Nos. 99-4, \n99-5, & 99-7).  The ACLU cited this as proof that the claimed need for secrecy concerning the \n\"Multiple FISC Orders\" could not be true.  The Government acknowledged its mistake and \nreleased redacted copies ofthose three orders.  The Government states it failed to locate these \norders in its search for responsive documents, and had it done so they would have been \n7 However, the Northern District of California concluded in a parallel litigation that \"[t]he evidence in the record \nshows that some documents, previously withheld in the course of this litigation and now declassified, had been \nwithheld in their entirety when a disclosure of reasonably segregable portions of those documents would have been \nrequired.\" Elec. Frontier Found. v. Dep't ofJustice, No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR (N.D. Cal. June 13,2014) (attached as \nEx. 8 to Supplemental Sims Decl. (ECF No. 99-8)). \n-10-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 11 of 18\ndeclassified and produced.  Therefore, it claims, this incident does not undermine the arguments \nin support of absolute secrecy for the \"Multiple FISC Orders,\" because these orders were never \nincluded within that category.  Letter from AUSA Emily E. Daughtry, July 9,2014 (ECF No. \n101). \nThese developments give this Court pause.  The Government's argument that it \nbelieved until June 2013 that FISC orders could not be produced in response to FOIA requests \nstrains credulity.  Its assertion on the initial summary judgment motion that segregating non-\nexempt information in FISC orders would leave only \"unintelligible sentences and phrases\" was \nincorrect.  And it then failed to produce or list on the Vaughn index three documents which the \nGovernment had disclosed elsewhere.  These inconsistencies shake this Court's confidence in the \nGovernment's submissions.  The deference the Government ordinarily receives in FOIA cases is \nrooted largely in the courts' trust that the Government will comply with its statutory obligations. \nThat compliance is not apparent here. \nFor the reasons below, the Government is entitled to summary judgment with \nrespect to FISC orders, if any, relating solely to the bulk collection of information other than \ntelephony metadata.  But because this Court has little faith in the Government's segregability \ndeterminations, the other documents in the Government's Vaughn index must be submitted for in \ncamera review.8  See Carter, 830 F.2d at 393. \n8 The Northern District of California recently granted summary judgment for the Government with respect to many \nof the same documents at issue here.  See Elec. Frontier Foundation v. Dep't ofJustice, No.4: ll-cv-05221-YGR, \n2014 WL 3945646 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 11,2014). However, that court also required ill camera review before granting \nthe Government's motion. \n-11-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 12 of 18\nIII.  Deference to Government's National Security Determinations \nDespite the searching inquiry this Court will give the Government's segregability \ndeterminations, the Government's affidavits are entitled to deference on whether disclosure of \ncertain information would harm national security.  In the national security context, a court \"must \naccord substantial weight to an agency's affidavit concerning the details of the classified status \nof the disputed record.\"  ACLU v. Dep't of Justice, 681 F.3d 61,69 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis in \noriginal) (quoting Wolfv. CIA, 473 F.3d 370,374 (D.C. Cir. 2007ยป.  \"Minor details of \nintelligence information may reveal more information than their apparentinsignificance suggests \nbecause, much like a piece of jigsa\\v puzzle, [each detail] may aid in piecing together other bits \nof information even when the individual piece is not of obvious importance in itself.\"  Wilner, \n592 F.3d at 73 (alteration in original) (quoting Larson, 565 F.3d at 864).  \"Recognizing the \nrelative competencies of the executive and judiciary, ... it is bad law and bad policy to 'second-\nguess the predictive judgments made by the government's intelligence agencies' regarding \nquestions such as whether disclosure of terrorist-related surveillance records would pose a threat \nto national security.\"  Wilner, 592 F.3d at 76 (quoting Larson, 565 F.3d at 865 (D.C. Cir. 2009ยป. \nA showing of bad faith on the part of the Government may negate the deference it \nis owed.  See Carney, 19 F.3d at 812.  The reasons for this Court's skepti~ism about the \nGovernment's segregability determinations are not a basis to second guess its national security \nassessments.  Because the executive is better equipped to determine potential harms to national \nsecurity than the judiciary, it deserves considerable deference on that issue. \nIV.  Unspecified Additional FISC Orders \nTurning at last to a subset of the documents at issue, the Government groups an \nunknown number of orders into a single entry in its Vaughn index, described only as \"Multiple \n-12-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 13 of 18\nFISC Orders\" with dates ranging from March 9, 2006 to June 30,2011.  Referred to as a \"no \nnumber, no list\" response, the Government acknowledges that responsive documents exist, but \ndoes not disclose further information about the documents in this category, including how many \nthere are or on what dates they issued.  See N.Y. Times Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 756 F.3d \n100, 105 (2d Cir. 2014) (\"N.Y. Times al-Awlaki,,).9  According to the Government, even this \nseemingly innocuous information could reveal the identities of telecommunications carriers who \nhave provided bulk records and when they did so.  Hudson Decl. ,-r,-r 54-56. \nIn its summary judgment motion, the ACLU treated the documents in the \"no \nnumber, no list\" response as falling within two categories: those that relate to telephony metadata \ncollection and those that relate to the bulk collection of other information.  The Government's \nresponse acknowledged some of the documents do relate to telephony metadata collection, but \nrefused to confinn or deny the existence of documents relating to the use of section 215 for the \nbulk collection of other information.  This acknowledgment effectively continues the \nGovernment's no number, no list response to documents relating to telephony metadata, but \nmakes a \"Glomar\" response with respect to documents pertaining to the bulk collection of other \ninformation.  A Glomar response, unlike a no number, no list response, neither confirms nor \ndenies the existence of responsive records.  See N.Y. Times (al-Awlaki), 756 F.3d at 105; \nWilner, 592 F.3d at 68. \nFor reasons already given, this Court will examine many of the documents in this \ncase in camera to assess the Government's arguments for itself.  But it is clear from the affidavits \nalone that the Government is entitled to provide a Glomar response with respect to documents \n9 This opinion will refer to this decision as the \"N.Y. Times Cal-Awlaki)\" so as to avoid confusion with the New \nYork Times FOIA action related to this case. \n-13-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 14 of 18\nrelating solely to the bulk collection of information other than telephony metadata, whether the \nGovernment intended to give such a response or not.  For the following reasons, summary \njudgment is granted to the Government for documents, if any, relating solely to information other \nthan telephony metadata, and any such documents need not be submitted for in camera review. \n\"[A  ]n agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records where to \nanswer the FOIA inquiry would cause harm cognizable under a[] FOIA exception.\" Wilner, 592 \nF.3d at 68 (alterations in original) (quoting Gardels v. CIA, 689 F.2d 1100, 1103 (D.C. Cir. \n1982ยป.  Therefore an agency may make a Glomar response when \"the existence or nonexistence \nof a record is a fact exempt from disclosure under a FOIA exemption.\"  Wilner, 592 F.2d at 70. \nHere, the Government asserts that the fact of whether the Government is engaging in the bulk \ncollection of information other than telephony metadata is itself exempt from disclosure under \nExemption 1 applies to properly classified national security information.  See 5 \nU.S.c. ยง 552(b)(1).  To be properly classified, national security information must (1) be \nclassified by an \"original classification authority,\" (2) be \"owned by, produced by or for, or [] \nunder the control of the United States Government,\" (3) fall within one or more of eight \nprotected categories of information, and (4) \"the unauthorized disclosure of the information \nreasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.\"  Exec. Order No. \n13526 ยง 1. 1 (a), 75 Fed. Reg. 707 (Jan. 5,2010).  The classification authority must be \"able to \nidentify or describe the damage\" that would be caused by disclosure of the information.  Exec. \nOrder No. 13526 ยง 1.1(a)(4). \nThe Government argues the existence or non-existence of other bulk collection \nprograms falls within Exemption 1 because it falls into one of the eight categories of classifiable \n-14-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 15 of 18\ninformation, \"intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods or \ncryptology,\" Exec. Order 13526, ยง lA(c ), and because \"disclosure of the existence or \nnonexistence of such activities reasonably could be expected to result in damage to national \nsecurity.\"  Supplemental Hudson Decl. ~ 13. \nExemption 3 applies to records exempted from disclosure by other federal \nstatutes.  See 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b )(3). \nExemption 3 differs from other FOIA exemptions in that its \napplicability depends less on the detailed factual contents of \nspecific documents; the sole issue for decision is the existence of a \nrelevant statute and the inclusion of withheld material within the \nstatute's coverage. \nWilner, 592 F.3d at 72 (quoting Ass'n of Retired R.R. Workers v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., 830 F.2d \n331,336 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).  \"In evaluating whether Exemption 3 applies, a court should 'not \nclosely scrutinize the contents of the withheld document; instead, [it should] detem1ine only \nwhether there is a relevant statute and whether the document falls within that statute.'\" N.Y. \nTimes, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 316 (alteration in original) (quoting Krikorian v. Dep't of State, 984 \nF.2d 461,465 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). \nThe Government argues the existence of other bulk collection programs, if any, \nfalls within Exemption 3 because it is protected by ยง 102A(i)(1) ofthe National Security Act of \n1947, as amended by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of2004 (codified at \n50 U.S.C. ยง 3024(i)(1)).  The National Security Act is a withholding statute for Exemption 3 \npurposes.  ACLU v. Dep't of Justice, 681 F.3d 61, 72-73 (2d Cir. 2012).  ยง 102A(i)(1) provides \nthat \"[t]he Director of National Intelligence shall protect intelligence sources and methods from \nunauthorized disclosure.\"  50 U.S.C. ยง 3024(i)(1).  For information which may disclose \nintelligence sources and methods, Exemption 3 and the National Security Act \"provide[] \n-15-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 16 of 18\noverlapping protection\" with Exemption 1.  Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 736 \nn.39 (D.C. Cir. 1981). \nThe ACLU argues that acknowledging the existence of records related to non-\ntelephony metadata bulk collection programs would not reveal the particular \"source or method\" \nused by the Government, a requirement under both exemptions as asserted here.  But this takes \ntoo narrow a view of both what the Government may keep classified and of the capabilities of \nour adversaries.  Assuming for a moment that the Government is not engaging in the bulk \ncollection of anything but telephone records, it is entitled to keep that fact-its lack of additional \nsources or methods-classified.  To acknowledge that would alert potential adversaries that they \nneed not be concerned about bulk collection of other types of information, negating the deterrent \neffect of not knowing whether the Government is watching or listening.  But if the Government \nis collecting other information in bulle, knowing that could permit a sophisticated adversary, \ntogether with disparate other pieces of information, to make an educated guess as to what the \nGovernment is doing.  A sophisticated adversary could determine what types of information the \nintelligence community would likely be interested in collecting in bulk and what types of \ninformation could in fact be easily collected.  Admitting the existence of other bulk collection \nprograms could permit these adyersaries to predict the Government's activities and evade them. \nIn Wilner, the Second Circuit rejected the plaintiffs' argument that a Glomar \nresponse may be used \"only to preserve the secrecy of a covert intelligence program or secret \nintelligence sources or methods.\"  Wilner, 592 F.3d at 69.  The court held that a Glomar response \nmay be appropriate even with respect to \"a program whose existence has been publicly \nrevealed.\"  Wilner, 592 F.3dat 69.  Implicit is that it is appropriate to invoke Glomar here, to \n-16-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-07562-WHP   Document 110   Filed 10/06/14   Page 17 of 18\npreserve the secrecy of the existence or non-existence of a covert intelligence program. \nAccordingly, summary judgment is granted to the Government on this issue. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Government's motion for summary judgment is \ngranted and the ACLU's motion is denied with respect to the Government's Glomar response for \nresponsive documents, if any, relating solely to the use of section 215 for bulk collection of \ninformation other than telephony metadata.  The Government is directed to submit the remaining \ndocuments for in camera review by October 17, 2014.  The Government is invited to make a \nfurther submission either reconsidering its determinations and proposing redactions or providing \nfurther support as to why these documents should be withheld in full.  Any ruling on the \nremainder of the summary judgment motions is deferred pending this Court's review. \nNew York, New York \nSO ORDERED: \n\" \n\"\\)~ \n~~l>==  ~ \nnA.\",\" \nIII  . \nWILLIAM H.
