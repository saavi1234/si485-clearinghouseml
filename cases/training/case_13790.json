Based on a review of the \ninformation and data provided by the District, the United States advised the District that, in its \nview, the District has fulfilled its affirmative desegregation obligations under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and applicable federal law , entitling the District to a declaration of unitary status. \nAs indicated by the signatures of counsel below, the parties respectfully request that the Court \napprove this Agreed Order for Dismissal, declaring that the District has achieved unitary status \nand dismissing this case against the District. \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThe United States initiated this school desegregation suit against the Texas Education \nPage 1 of9 \n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 197   Filed in TXSD on 04/13/07   Page 2 of 9\nAgency and the District on August 7, 1970 in the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas. \nOn August 21, 1970, this Court approved a desegregation plan that, among other things, \nrequired the District to (1) assign faculty and staffwho work directly with children so that the \nratio of black to white teachers in each school is \"substantially the same\" as the corresponding \nDistrict elementary school or high school ratio, with no more than a 5% variance in each school \n(\"5% variance provision\"); (2) operate a non-segregated and otherwise non-discriminatory \nstudent transportation system; (3) consider the effect that school construction, school \nconsolidation, and site selection have on the desegregation process; (4) implement an inter-\ndistrict student transfer policy where the cumulative effect of such transfers will not reduce \ndesegregation; (5) conduct all curricular and  extracurricular activities on a non-discriminatory \nbasis; (6) assign students to schools with an attendance zone system; and (7) create a court-\napproved bi-racial committee charged with reviewing the student transportation system, selecting \nnew school sites, and submitting bi-annual reports to the Court.  Consent Decree, Aug. 21, 1970 \n(\"1970 Order\"). \nOn June 30, 1998, this Court found that the District had \"substantially complied with the \nreporting requirements\" of the 1970 Order and vacated the reporting requirement.  Supplemental \nDecree, Jun. 30, 1998, at 1-2. \nIn July 2005, to assess the status of the District's desegregation efforts, the United States \ninitiated a review of the case and requested information from the District regarding, among other \nthings, student assignment, faculty/staff assignment and hiring, transportation policies, \nextracurricular activities, and facilities. \nPage 2 of9 \n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 197   Filed in TXSD on 04/13/07   Page 3 of 9\nII.

Req. (Nov. 21,2005). \nAs demonstrated above, there has been significant demographic change in the District, \nwith the black student population increasing from 9% to 22%, the white student population \ndecreasing from 86% to 9%, and the Hispanic student population increasing from 9% to 68%. \nThe District does not enroll a significant number of out-of-district students.  For the \n2004-05 and 2005-06 school years, approximately 1%   of the District's enrollment was from \ninter-district transfers. \nThe District has dismantled its former dual system; it currently has no one-race or \nvirtually all-black or all-white schools.  Only a single school is majority black - Freedom \nElementary - and that school's white student enrollment reflects the districtwide average.  There \nare no majority white schools.  Indeed, the highest percentage white at any school is 16%. \nPage 5 of9 \n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 197   Filed in TXSD on 04/13/07   Page 6 of 9\nB.  Faculty and Staff Assignment. \nIn the 1970-71 school year, the District employed a total of 470 teachers of whom 12% \nwere black, 87% were white, and 1%   were Hispanic.  In the 2005-06 school year, the District \nemployed 1,518 teachers of whom 23% were black, 52% were white, 22% were Hispanic, and \n3% were Asian.  The District has substantially complied with the 5% variance provision of the \nAug. 1970 Order and assigns faculty and staff such that no school can be identified as a \"black\" \nor \"white\" school. \nC.  Transportation. \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in student transportation. \nD.  Extracurricular Activities. \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in extracurricular activities. \nE.  Facilities. \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in school construction, school consolidation, and \nsite selection. \nIn sum, there is no evidence that vestiges of segregation remain in any other facet of the \nDistrict's operations. \nIII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school desegregation case is to convert \npromptly a de jure segregated school system to a system without ''white'' schools or \"black\" \nschools, but just schools.  Green v. County Sch. Bd. ofN  ew Kent County. Va., 391 U.S. 430, 442 \n(1968).  The standard established by the Supreme Court for determining whether a school district \nhas achieved unitary status, thus warranting termination ofj udicial supervision, is:  (1) whether \nPage 6 of9 \n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 197   Filed in TXSD on 04/13/07   Page 7 of 9\nthe school district has fully and satisfactorily complied with the court's desegregation orders for a \nreasonable period of time; (2) whether the school district has eliminated the vestiges of past de \njure discrimination to the extent practicable; and (3) whether the school district has demonstrated \na good faith commitment to the whole of the court's order and to those provisions of the law and \nthe Constitution which were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.  See \nMissouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70,87-89 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491-92, 498 \n(1992); Bd. ofEduc. of Okla. City Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248-50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \"Green factors,\" \nwhich must be addressed as part of the detennination of whether a school district has fulfilled its \nduties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual school system to the extent practicable: \n(1) student assignment; (2) faculty; (3) staff; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and \n(6) facilities.  Green, 391 U.S. at 435.  See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250; Jenkins, 122 F.3d at 591, \nn.3.  But the Green factors are not intended to be a \"rigid framework;\" the Supreme Court has \napproved consideration of other indicia, such as \"quality of education,\" as important factors in \ndetermining whether the District has fulfilled its desegregation obligations.  See Freeman, 503 \nU.S. at 492-93. \nBased on the infonnation and data provided by the District and on all the surrounding \nfacts, the District has complied with the Court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period of \ntime and has eliminated the vestiges of past de jure discrimination to the extent practicable. \nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 491-92, 498; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250; Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 87-89. \nFurthermore, the compliance by the District demonstrates a good faith commitment to the whole \nof this Court's orders and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution that were predicate \nPage 7 of9 \n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 197   Filed in TXSD on 04/13/07   Page 8 of 9\nfor judicial intervention in the first instance.  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.  The Court concludes, \ntherefore, that the District has met the legal standards for a declaration of unitary status, and that \nit is entitled to dismissal of this action. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the District is hereby declared UNITARY, all \nprior injunctions in this case are DISSOLVED, jurisdiction is TERMINATED, and this case is \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE against the District only.  The case remains in place as to all \nother defendants. \nM \n~~~~~IS~::::=:::-filDAI'n\"lIHl \nl3 \nO:H\"'f>\"  ,2006. \nThe following signatures of the parties indicate their consent to the fonn and content of this \norder. \nFOR THE UNITED STATES: \nWANJ.KIM \nDONALD J.

Based on a review of the information and data provided by \nMCISD, the United States advised the District that, in its view, MCISD has fulfilled its \naffirmative desegregation obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable federal \nlaw, entitling MCISD to a declaration of unitary status.  As indicated by the signatures of counsel \nbelow, the parties respectfully request that the Court approve this Agreed Order for Dismissal, \ndeclaring that MCISD has achieved unitary status and dismissing this case against MCISD. \n-1-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 199-1   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/07   Page 2 of 8\nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThe United States initiated this school desegregation suit against the Texas Education \nAgency and MCISD on August 7, 1970 in the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas. \nOn November 6, 1970, this Court approved a desegregation plan that, among other things, \nrequired MCISDto (1) assign faculty and staffwho work directly with children so that the ratio \nof black to white teachers in each school is \"substantially the same\" as the ratio of black to white \nteachers in the entire school system, with no more than a 10% variance in each school; (2) \noperate a non-segregated and otherwise non-discriminatory student transportation system; (3) \nconsider the effect that school construction, school consolidation, and site selection have on the \ndesegregation process; (4) implement an inter-district student transfer policy where the \ncumulative effect of such transfers will not reduce desegregation; (5) conduct all curricular and \nextracurricular activities on a non-discriminatory basis; and (6) submit bi -annual reports to the \nCourt.  Consent Decree, Nov. 6, 1970 (\"1970 Decree\"). \nOn June 30, 1998, this Court found that MCISD had \"substantially complied with the \nreporting requirements\" of the 1970 Decree and vacated the reporting requirement. \nSupplemental Decree, June 30, 1998, at 1-2. \nIn December 2006, pursuant to the Court's December 14,2006 Order, the United States \ninitiated a review of the case to assess the status ofMCISD's desegregation efforts and requested \ninformation from the District regarding, among other things, student assignment, faculty/staff \nassignment and hiring, transportation policies, extracurricular activities, and facilities.  The \nUnited States also interviewed District personnel and visited each of the District's facilities. \n-2-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 199-1   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/07   Page 3 of 8\nII.  STIPULATED FACTS \nA.  Student Assignment. \nIn the 2006-07 school year, MCISD operated four schools in which it emolled a total of \n2,252 students of whom 21 % were black, 26% were Hispanic, 52% were white, and 1%   were \n\"other.\" The current emollment of the District's schools is illustrated .below: \nMCISD Student Enrollment \n2006-07 School Year \nSchools  Black  White  Hispanic  Other  Total \nMadisonville Elementary  169 (25%)  301 (45%)  191 (29%)  5 (1%)  666 \nSchool (PK-2) \nMadisonville Intermediate  107 (21 %)  270 (53%)  128 (25%)  3 (1%)  508 \nSchool (3\"-5) \n'Madisonville Junior High  95 (19%)  258 (53%)  131 (27%)  5 (1%)  489 \nSchool (6-8) \nMadisonville High School  111 (19%)  339 (57%)  136 (23%)  3 (1 %) .  589 \n(9-12) \nDistrict-Wide  482 (21%)  1,168 (52%)  586 (26%)  16 (1 %)  2,252 \nSource: District-supplied data (PIEMS) for 2006-07 school year. \nMCISD has dismantled its former dual system; it currently has no racially identifiable \nschools.  With only four campuses consisting of a single grade structure, there is no distinction \nmade according to race when placing students, and the student assignment at each school reflects \nthe district-wide average.  Classroom assignments are made on a non-discriminatory basis. \nB.  Faculty and Staff Assignment. \nIn the 2006-07 school year, MCISD employed 161 teachers of whom 3% were black, \n96% were white, and 1%   were Hispanic.  MCISD has complied with the 10% variance provision \nof the 1970 Decree and assigns faculty and staff such that no school is racially identifiable by \nvirtue of its faculty assignments. \n-3-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 199-1   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/07   Page 4 of 8\nC.  Transportation. \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in student transportation.  MCISD provides \ntransportation according to state guidelines and without regard to race. \nD.  Extracurricular Activities. \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in extracurricular activities. \nE.  Facilities. \nAs MCISD operates a single-grade structure system, there is no evidence of \ndiscrimination in school construction, school consolidation, or site selection. \nIn sum, the~e is no evidence that vestiges of segregation remain in any facet of the \nMCISD's operations. \nIII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school desegregation case is to convert \npromptly a de jure segregated school system to a system without \"white\" schools or \"black\" \nschools, but just schools.  Green v.  County Sch. Bd o/New Kent County, Va., 391 U.S. 430, 442 \n(1968).  The standard established by the Supreme Court for determining whether a school district \nhas achieved unitary status, thus warranting termination of judicial supervision, is:  (1) whether \nthe school district has fully and satisfactorily complied with the court's desegregation orders for a \nreasonable period of time; (2) whether the school district has eliminated the vestiges of past de \njure discrimination to the extent practicable; and (3) whether the school district has demonstrated \na good faith commitment to the whole of the court's order and to those provisions ofthe law and \nthe Constitution which were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.  See \nMissouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 87-89 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467,491-92,498 \n-4-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 199-1   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/07   Page 5 of 8\n(1992); Bd ofEduc. of Okla. City Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 248-50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \"Green factors,\" \nwhich must be addressed as part of the determination of whether a school district has fulfilled its \nduties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual school system to the extent practicable: \n(1) student assignment; (2) faculty; (3) staff; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and \n(6) facilities.  Green, 391 U.S. at 435.  See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250; Jenkins,  122 F.3d at 591, \nn.3 .. The Green factors, however, were not intended to be a \"rigid framework.\"  The Supreme \nCourt has approved consideration of other indicia, such as \"quality of education,\" as important \nfactors in determining whether a district has fulfilled its desegregation obligations.  See Freeman, \n503 U.S. at 492-93. \nBased on the information and data provided by MCISD and on all the surrounding facts, \nthe District has complied with the Court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period of time \nand has eliminated the vestiges of past de jure discrimination to the extent practicable.  Freeman, \n503 U.S. at 491-92,498; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250; Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 87-89.  Furthermore, the \ncompliance by MCISD demonstrates a good faith commitment to the whole of this Court's \norders and to those provisions of the law and the Constitution that were predicate for judicial \nintervention in the first instance.  Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.  The Court concludes, therefore, that \nMCISD has met the legal standards for a declaration of unitary status, and that it is entitled to \ndismissal of this action. \n-5-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 199-1   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/07   Page 6 of 8\nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that MCISD is hereby declared UNITARY, all prior \ninjunctions in this case are DISSOLVED, jurisdiction is TERMINATED, and this case is \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE against the MCISD.  The case remains inplace as to all other \ndefendants. \nENTERED THIS __ DAY OF ______,  2007. \nUnited States District Judge \n-6-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 199-1   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/07   Page 7 of 8\nThe following signatures of the parties indicate their consent to the form and content of this \norder. \nFOR THE UNITED STATES: \nWANJ.KIM \nDONALD 1.

This review included information requests to the District, \ninterviews with District personnel, and a site visit to various District facilities.  Based on a \nreview of the information and data provided by KISD, visits to the various schools, interviews. \nwith District personnel, and publicly available data, the United States advised the District that, in \nits view, KISD has fulfilled its affirmative desegregation obligations under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and applicable federal law, entitling KISD to a declaration of unitary status.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn August 7, 1970, the United States initiated this school desegregation suit against the \nTexas Educatiori Agency (\"TEA\") and KISD in the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas.  United States v. Katy Indep. Sch. Dist., 333 F. Supp. 1325, 1326 (S.D. Tex. \n1971).  On September 17, 1971, a Court Decree implemented the Plan for Desegregation, \nproposed by the Distri~t and approved by the United States.  Consistant with the principles \nestablished in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. ofEduc., 402 U.S. 1 (1971) and Green v. \nu.s. \nCounty School Board ofN  ew Kent County, Virginia 391  430 (1968), the Plan for \nDesegregation required KISD, inter alia, to: (1) adopt certain student assignment procedures and \ncontinue to evaluate its student assignment in light of the principles in recent Supreme Court \ndecisions; (2) hire, assign, promote, pay, dismiss, demote, or otherwise treat faculty and staff in a \nnon-discriminatory manner; (3) operate a non-segregated and otherwise non-discriminatory \nstudent transportation system; (4) conduct all school construction, school consolidation, and she \nselection in a manner to insure the continuation of a desegregated school system; (5) implement \nan inter-district student transfer policy where the cumulative effect of such transfers will not \nreduce desegregation; (6) conduct all curricular and extracurricular activities on a non \ndiscriminatory basis; and (7) submit annual reports to the Court.  Decree, September 17, 1971 \n(\" 1971 Decree\").  Since the time of the 1971 Decree, little litigation has occurred in this case. \nOn June 30, 1998, a Supplemental Decree was filed with this Court.  The Court found \nthat KISDhad \"substantially complied with the reporting requirements for more than 20 years, \nand neither the United States nor another party [had] complained about the school [district's] \ncompliance\" with the 1971 Decree, and therefore, vacated the reporting requirement. \n-2-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 205   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/08   Page 3 of 10\nJ \nSupplemental Decree, June 30, 1998, at 1-2. \nIn March 2007, the United States initiated a review of the case to assess the status of \nKISD's desegregation efforts and requested information from the District regarding, among other \nthings, student assignment, faculty/staff assignment and hiring, transportation policies, \nextracurricular activities, and facilities.  In February 2008, the United States visited ten District \nschools and spoke with numerous District personnel. \nII.  STIPU~ATED FACTS \nA.

The black student population decreased from 18.5% to \n-5-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 205   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/08   Page 6 of 10\n16%, the white student population decreased from 80.1 % to 46%, and the Hispanic student \npopulation increased from 1.3% to 29.0%.  Moreover, the District grew from 2,604 students to \n41,406 students. \nKISD has dismantled its former dual system; it currently has no one-race or virtually one \nrace schools.  Classroom assignments are made on a non-discriminatory basis. \nB.  Faculty and Staff Assignment \nIn the 1970-71 school year, KISD employed a total of 122 teachers of whom 14.8% were \nblack, 85.2% were white, and 0% was Hispanic.  In the 2005-06 school year, KISD employed \n2,306 teachers of whom 6.4% were black, 85.3% were white, 7.2% were Hispanic, and 1.1% \nwere \"other.\" KISD hires, assigns, promotes, pays, dismisses, demotes, or otherwise treats \nfaculty and·staffin a non-discriminatory manner. \nC.  Transportation \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in student transportation.  KISD provides \ntransportation according to state guidelines and without regard to race. \nD.  Extracurricular Activities \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in extracurricular activities. \nE.  Facilities \nThere is no evidence of discrimination in school construction, school consolidation, or \nsite selection. \nIn sum, there is no evidence that vestiges of segregation remain in any facet ofKISD's \noperations. \n-6-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 205   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/08   Page 7 of 10\nIII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school desegregation case is to convert \npromptly a de jure segregated school system to a system without \"white\" schools or \"black\" \nschools, but just schools.  Green v. County Sch. Bd o/New Kent County, Va., 391 U.S. 430,442 \n(1968).  The standard established by the Supreme Court for determining whether a school district \nhas achieved unitary status, thus warranting termfuation of judicial supervision, is:  (1) whether \nthe school district has fully and satisfactorily complied with the court's desegregation orders for a \nreasonable period of time; (2) whether the school district has eliminated the vestiges of past de \njure discrimination to the extent practicable; and (3) whether the school district has demonstrated \na good faith commitment to the whole of the court's order and to those provisions of the law and \nthe Constitution which were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance.  See \nMissouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 87-89 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491-92, 498 \n(1992); Bd. o/Educ. o/Okla. Ciiy Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237,248-50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \"Green factors,\" \nwhich must be addressed as part of the determination of whether a school district has fulfilled its \nduties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual school system to the extent practicable: \n(1) student assignment; (2) faculty; (3) staff; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and \n(6) facilities.  Green, 391 U.S. at 435; see also Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250; Jenkins, 122 F.3d at 591, \nn.3.  The Green factors, however, are not intended to be a \"rigid framework.\"  The Supreme \nCourt has approved consideration of other indicia, such as \"quality of education,\" as important \nfactors in determining whether a district has fulfilled its desegregation obligations. See Freeman, \n503 U.S. at 492-93. \n-7-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 205   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/08   Page 8 of 10\n'-;::J---\"-\nBased on the information and data provided by KIS'n and on all the surrounding facts, the \nDistrict has complied with the Court's desegregation orders for a reasonable period of time and \nhas eliminated the vestiges of past de jure discrimination to the extent practicable. See Freeman, \n503 U.s. at 491-92,498; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250; Jenkins, 515 U.s. at 87-89.  Furthermore, the \ncompliance by KISD demonstrates a good faith commitment to the whole of this Court's orders \nand to those provisions of the law and the Constitution that were the predicate for judicial \nintervention in the fIrst instance.  See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.  The Court concludes, therefore, \nthat KISD has met the legal standards for a declaration of unitary status, and that it is entitled to \ndismissal of this action. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that KISD is hereby declared UNITARY, all prior \ninjunctions in this case are DISSOLVED,jurisdiction is TERMINATED, and this case is \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE against the KISD.  The case remains in place as to all other \nI~ \n,2007. \n\\ \nI·~·.,  ~.  \\ \n, \nUnited States District Judge \n-8-\n\nCase 4:70-cv-00832   Document 205   Filed in TXSD on 04/17/08   Page 9 of 10\nThe following sigilatures of the parties indicate their consent to the fonn and content of this \norder. \nFOR THE UNITED STATES: \nGRACE CHUNG BECKER \nDONALD J.
