    "summary": "<p>(This summary is temporary, while we continue to research this case.)</p>\r\n<p>These twenty-nine school desegregation cases in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana were consolidated after they were remanded by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Adams v. Mathews</em>. In <em>Adams</em>, the Fifth Circuit ordered the district court to determine if freedom of choice plans were &ldquo;adequate to convert the dual system to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.&rdquo; The district court held that the freedom of choice plans were adequate to eliminate dual systems (segregated school systems) and foster the creation of a unitary systems (desegregated school systems). Conley v. Lake Charles Sch. Bd., 293 F. Supp. 84 (W.D. La. 1968).</p>\r\n<p>The decision in <em>Conley</em> was then appealed to the Fifth Circuit. These cases were consolidated with other cases from across Louisiana on appeal under the name <em>Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board</em>. The Fifth Circuit held that freedom of choice plans were inadequate to desegregate the schools and the cases were remanded to the district court. 417 F.2d 801 (5th Cir. 1969). The cases returned to the district court. The district court, sitting en banc, held that each local school system had to consider their unique problems and, working together with the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), had to consider their unique circumstances when creating new desegregation plans. Conley v. Lake Charles Sch. Bd., 303 F. Supp. 394 (W.D. La. 1969). The district court then approved individual school desegregation plans one by one. Some of those plans were appealed, so the Fifth Circuit stepped in to adjust the plans as it saw fit.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought additional relief from the district court in 1970 in accordance with the Fifth Circuit decision in Hall. v. St. Helena Parish School Board, 417 F.2d 801 (5th Cir. 1969). The district court ruled that school desegregation plans submitted by HEW had to contain provisions in line with Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District regarding faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, facilities, and transfer. 419 F.2d 1211 (5th Cir. 1969). After the district court approved the desegregation plans, the plaintiffs appealed again. The Fifth Circuit adopted adjustments to the HEW plans so that the plans were constitutional.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Available Opinions</p>\r\n<p>Conley v. Lake Charles Sch. Bd., 293 F.

Burger, than an active \n  judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and now the nominee of President \nNixon to be Chief Justice of the United States, in a dissenting opinion written by him as recently as January 21, 1969, \n  3 \n \n\n \nin Smuck v. Hobson, 408 F.2d 175, at pages 196 and 197: \nBURGER, Circuit Judge (with whom Circuit Judge Tamm joins): \n‘We join in Judge DANAHER’S opinion and his view that sound principles of judicial restraint command that the \nmandate be vacated assuming, arguendo, that a subject so complex and elusive, and so far beyond the competence \nof judges, would have warranted judicial action in the first instance. \n‘We add a brief comment to underscore what we believe is implicit in the principal opinion, and indeed in Judge \nDANAHER’S dissent. The holding of the District Court is not affirmed as written but only as construed by four \nmembers of this court. Even a cursory reading of the principal opinion reveals that as so construed, the mandate \nunder review is essentially advisory to the former school board which has ceased to exist. As we see it the new \nschool board is at liberty to make such use of it as it desires in much the same way as it may derive useful guidance \nfrom the Passow Report. \n‘Several commentators have expressed views which undergird what Judge DANAHER has said as to the need for \ncaution and restraint by judges when they are asked to enter areas so far beyond judicial competence as the subject \nof how to run a public school system. We have little difficulty taking judicial notice of the reality that most if not all \nof the problems dealt with in the District Court findings and opinion are, and have long been, much debated among \nschool administrators and educators. There is little agreement on these matters, and events often lead experts to \nconclude that views once held have lost their validity. The commentary from various sources, including law reviews, \ntends to supply strong support for Judge DANAHER’S very sound view on the need for judicial restraint. The Harvard \nLaw Review comments: \n* * * The limits upon what the judiciary can accomplish in an active role are an additional reason for circumspection, \nparticularly in an area where the courts can offer no easy solutions. * * * A court applying the Hobson doctrine must \nnecessarily resolve disputed issues of educational policy by determining whether integration by race or class is more \ndesirable; whether compensatory programs should have priority over integration; whether equalization of physical \nfacilities  is  an  efficient  means  of  allocating  available  resources  for  the  purpose  of  achieving  overall  equal \nopportunity. There is a serious danger that judicial prestige will be committed to ineffective solutions, and that \nexpectations raised by Hobsonlike decisions will be disappointed. Furthermore, judicial intervention risks lending \nunnecessary rigidity to treatment of the social problems involved by foreclosing a more flexible, experimental \napproach. The Hobson doctrine (Hobson v. Hansen (D.C.), 269 F.Supp. 401 (1967), Honorable J. Skelly Wright, Circuit \nJudge, sitting as a District Judge) can be criticized for its unclear basis in precedent, its potentially enormous scope, \nand its imposition of responsibilities which may strain the resources and endanger the prestige of the judiciary. * * * \nHobson v. Hansen; Judicial Supervision of the Color-Blind School Board, 81 HARV.L.REV. 1511, 1527, 1525 (1968). \nThe Stanford University Law Review had these comments: \nIt seems to have been the very magnitude of these problems that led the (District) court to search for remedies. In a \nbrief paragraph entitled ‘Parting Word’ the court, anticipating the adverse reaction its substantially unprecedented \nintervention has indeed provoked, set forth its apologia in these terms: It is regrettable, of course, that in deciding \nthis case this court must act in an area so alien to its expertise. It would be far better indeed for these great social \nand political problems to be resolved in the political arena by other branches of government. But these are social \nand political problems which seem at times to defy such resolution. In such situations, under our system, the \njudiciary must bear a hand and accept its responsibility to assist in the solution where constitutional rights hang in \nthe balance. * * * if at this time, however, such problems seem to ‘defy’ social and political resolution, they are not \nfor that reason more open to resolution by the courts. The responsibility lies first with those whose area of expertise \ncomprehends feasible solutions. \nHobson v.

The New York Times in its annual educational survey for 1968, thirteen and one-half years after Brown v. \nBoard of Education, suggests that we are hardly any further along the line toward school desegregation than we \nwere in 1954. \nThe Washington, D.C., example is too much with us. And everything that Judge Skelly Wright can do will not afford \nan integrated school system for the Nation’s capital. All that he can accomplish is to assure that the brighter \nstudents receive no better education within the system than the other students. \nAs I have suggested, it is perhaps because of the fact that local governmental units, especially those located in \nmetropolitan areas, cannot or will not bring about racial desegregation that some are looking to the  equal \neducational opportunity concept to break down the municipal boundaries in order to include suburban areas under \nthe same umbrella as that which covers the slum schools. Absent a reversal of the court’s decision in Pierce v. \nSociety of Sisters, however, the escape route of private education will not be closed. And a reversal of that decision \nwill arouse the opposition not only of the suburbanites but of organized religions as well.

Cleveland v. Union Parish Sch. Bd., 406 \nF.2d 1331 (5th Cir. 1969). The dissenting opinion to that order appears in 406 F.2d at 1333. \nBoth the Western District and the Eastern District cases were among those consolidated on appeal in Adams v. \nMathews, 403 F.2d 181 (5th Cir. 1968). \n \n5  303 F.Supp. 1224 (E.D.La.1969). \n \n \n6  298 F.Supp. 283 (E.D.La.1969). \n \n \n7  ‘Here the district court found that the school board acted in good faith. But good faith does not excuse a board’s \n  non-compliance with its affirmative duty to liquidate the dual system. Good faith is relevant only as a necessary \ningredient of an acceptable desegregation plan.’ Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal Separate Sch. Dist., supra 409 F.2d at \n684. \n \n8  Twenty-two of the school boards were ordered to integrate their school systems beginning with the 1965-66 school \n  year. Two boards commenced with the 1964-65 school year. Nine began in 1966-67, and five did not begin until the \n1967-68 school year. \n \n9  ‘With every ounce of sincerity which we possess we think freedom of choice is the best plan available. We are not \n  today going to jeopardize the success already achieved by casting aside something that is working and reach blindly \ninto an experimental ‘grab bag.“ \n293 F.Supp. at 88. \n \n10  See the concurring opinion of Judge Rubin in Duval County: \n \n‘Green emphasizes that school officials have a continuing duty to take whatever action may be necessary to provide \n‘prompt and effective disestablishment of a dual system.’ If one method is ineffective, they are to try another. \nHence, no single plan is or can be judicially approved as a catholicon. ‘Brown I and all of its successors, as well as \nGreen, Monroe, and Raney, contemplate that school plans will be prepared by local officials and school boards, not \nby courts. But if local officials fail to assume their responsibilities under the Constitution, district courts must \n  47 \n \n\n \ncontinue to attempt to formulate the plans that should be prepared by school officials based on their expert \nknowledge, training and skill.’ (Citations omitted.) \n402 F.2d at 908. \n \n11  See, e.g., the discussion of Whittenberg v. Greenville County School District, 298 F.Supp. 784 (D.C.S.C., March 31, \n  1969), at note 14, infra, and accompanying text. \n \n12  But a plan which contributes toward preserving segregated schools by incorporating zones corresponding to racially \n  separate residential patterns is unacceptable. United States v. Indianola, supra. \n \n13  At least two district judges in Louisiana have ordered the use of the facilities of this center. Tangipahoa Parish, \n  before us on this appeal, was ordered on October 15, 1968 to produce a plan for the 1969-70 school year for unitary \noperation of its school system. When the school board informed the court that it was unable to find a plan better \nthan the one in existence, the court appointed the Center to prepare a plan. A hearing has not yet been held on \nwhether the Center’s plan will be adopted. \nIn Harris v. St. John the Baptist Parish Sch. Bd., Civ.No. 13212 (E.D.La. Apr. 23, 1969), the school board, after it did \nnot come up with a plan of its own, was ordered to consult with the Center. A hearing was set on the Center’s plan. \nThe board came in with two plans of its own. The district judge accepted one of the board’s plans, which \nincorporated some of the Center’s suggestions. \n \n14  The district court directed that all school districts submit to the Office of Education, HEW, their existing method of \n  operation, along with any changes proposed by them, and to seek to develop in conjunction with HEW an \nacceptable plan of operation ‘conformable to the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs * * * and consonant in timing \nand method with the practical and administrative problems faced by the particular districts.’ If a plan is agreed upon \nby the school district and HEW, the South Carolina district court will approve it unless the plaintiffs show it does not \nmeet constitutional standards. If the school district already is operating under a plan approved by HEW, it will be \nadopted by the court absent a showing of constitutional infirmity. If no agreed plan is developed, the court will hold \na hearing and enter its decree, considering the respective proposed plans of the district, the plaintiffs, and HEW. \n \n15  The Supreme Court said: ‘The general experience under ‘freedom of choice’ to date has been such as to indicate its \n  ineffectiveness as a tool of desegregation.’ 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1695, 20 L.Ed.2d at 725. \nSee also the opinion of District Judge Heebe in Moses v. Washington Parish School Board, 276 F.Supp. 834 at \n851-852 (E.D.La.1967): \n‘If this Court must pick a method of assigning students to schools within a particular school district, barring very \nunusual circumstances, we could imagine no method more inappropriate, more unreasonable, more needlessly \nwasteful in every respect, than the socalled ‘free-choice’ system. \n‘Under such a system the school board cannot know in advance how many students will choose any school in the \nsystem— it cannot even begin to estimate the number. The first principle of pupil assignment in the scheme of \nschool administration is thus thwarted; the principle ought to be to utilize all available classrooms and schools to \n  48 \n \n\n \naccommodate the most favorable number of students; instead, this aim is surrendered in order to introduce an \nelement of ‘liberty’ (never before part of efficient school administration) on the part of the students in the choice of \ntheir own school. Obviously there is no constitutional ‘right’ for any student to attend the public school of his own \nchoosing. But the extension of the privilege of choosing one’s school, far from being a ‘right’ of the students, is not \neven consistent with sound school administration. Rather, the creation of such a choice only has the result of \ndemoralizing the school system itself, and actually depriving every student of a good education. \n‘Under a ‘free-choice’ system, the school board cannot know or estimate the number of students who will want to \nattend any school, or the identity of those who will eventually get their choice. Consequently, the board cannot \nmake plans for the transportation of students to schools, plan curricula, or even plan such things as lunch allotments \nand schedules; moreover, since in no case except by purest coincidence will an appropriate distribution of students \nresult, and each school will have either more or less than the number it is designed to efficiently handle, many \nstudents at the end of the free-choice period have to be reassigned to schools other than those of their choice— \nthis time on a strict geographical-proximity basis, see the Jefferson County decree, thus burdening the board, in the \nmiddle of what should be a period of firming up the system and making final adjustments, with the awesome task of \ndetermining which students will have to be transferred and which schools will receive them. Until that final task is \ncompleted, neither the board nor any of the students can be sure of which school they will be attending; and many \nstudents will in the end be denied the very ‘free choice’ the system is supposed to provide them.’ (Emphasis in \noriginal.) \n \n16  See Davis v. Mobile County, supra, in which this court required a zone plan for urban areas but left freedom of \n  choice in effect in rural areas. See also the dissenting opinion to the denial of en banc hearing in the instant cases, \n406 F.2d at 1338-1339: ‘I am not suggesting that freedom of choice should necessarily be abandoned in favor of \nzoning. * * * There is nothing necessarily unconstitutional about freedom of choice of geographic zoning or a \ncombination of the two.’ \n \n1  Not available. This signal followed by dashes in adjoining columns means figures for all such columns are available \n \n \n2  The 1969-70 figures for all school systems, where shown, are based upon the incomplete results of the latest choice \n  period (March 1, 1969 to April 1, 1969). They are not intended to be a completely accurate forecast of the racial \nmake-up of the schools involved for 1969-70. At oral argument of these cases the parties were directed to furnish \nthis information to the court to the extent possible, and in most instances they have done so. \n \n3  Figures given for faculty cross-overs for 1969-70 in all school systems, where shown, represent only the planned or \n  tentative assignments as reported to the court by the school boards since oral argument. \n \n4  Fractions have been dropped from teacher cross-over figures, with no attempt to round off the figure. \n \n \n5  In a report filed in the district court February 27, 1967, a copy of which has been filed with this court pursuant to our \n  oral order for additional data, the Bossier Parish School Board states that it has set as a minimum goal for 1969-70 a \n100% increase in faculty integration. \n  49 \n \n\n \n \n6  In this parish there are minor discrepancies between those figures collated by the appellants and those by the \n  United States. The differences are nominal and do not impel a different conclusion on any issue in the case. We use \nappellants’ figures. \n \n7  In a report filed in the district court on February 21, 1969 Caddo Parish states it has a goal of increasing faculty \n  cross-over by 50% for the 1969-70 school year. \n \n8  In its report to the district court in February, the East Carroll School Board states it has plans to increase faculty \n  integration by approximately 100% in 1969-70. \n \n6  In this parish there are minor discrepancies between those figures collated by the appellants and those by the \n  United States. The differences are nominal and do not impel a different conclusion on any issue in the case. We use \nappellants’ figures. \n \n9  1967-68 reports of school board to the district court show that no teacher served full time in a Cross-over situation. \n  1968-69 reports do not distinguish between full and part-time teachers. \n \n10  Vermillion Parish has only one remaining school in which negroes are predominant. That school is all-Negro. \n \n \n11  Statistics on student integration in 1967-68 in Winn Parish appear to be derived from choice form reports to the \n  district court dated September 8, 1967. They do not necessarily represent the number of students attending \nintegrated schools during that year. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  50 \n ",

If found that there would be a 150% \nIncrease in the number of students transported by bus, requiring 85 additional buses and 85 additional \ndrivers (the system has 61 buses). The increase in cost which would be incurred the first year from additional \nbus transportation was found to be close to a million dollars. \n  11 \n \n\n \n \n6  Marion (J-4 and H-1) and Kennedy (E-11), which are integrated schools, also are substantially overcapacity in \n  assignments. Their condition is relieved by the adjustments made in this opinion. \n \n7  Reynaud (J-2) is 86% Black. It is not overcapacity. When it is included with the above schools, the number of \n  blacks in Ward 3 attending schools all black, or substantially so, becomes 5454, or 68% Of those in the ward, \n54% Of those in the system. \n \n8  This is matter in which the biracial committee might be of particular assistance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  12 \n ",

Because  we  find  that  (1)  Singleton  has  never  been \nenrolled  as  class  counsel  and  (2)  none  of  the  individual \nappellants  has  standing  to  challenge  the  district court's  order, \nwe  dismiss  this  appeal. \nI. \nThis  appeal  comes  before  the  Court  as  the  latest \ninstallment  of  the  ongoing  saga  of  the  effort  to  desegregate  the \npublic  schools  in Calcasieu  Parish,  Louisiana.  In  1970,  aft~r \nfive  years  of  litigation,  we  found  a  Calcasieu  Parish School \nBoard  (School  Board)  desegregation  plan  unconstitutional, \nmandated  certain  changes,  and  stated  that: \nThe  Board  is  free  to  devise  a  different  plan,  or  to \nseek  changes  and  adjustments,  and  the  District Court  has \ndiscretion  to  approve  such  alternatives,  provided  that \nno  such  different  plan  or  adjustment  diminishes  the \nextent  of  desegregation  projected  by.this  opinion  •••• \nConley  v.

Two  Jays  later,  the  district court  in \n.. \n~ \nconnection  with  the  motion  allowed  Louis  Berry  and  P.  Spencer \nTorry,  experienced  attorneys  in  desegregation  matters,  to  be \nenrolled  as  counsel  for  the  plaintiff class.  After  nineteen \nmonths  of  negotiation,  the  School Board  and  the  class  submitted \nto  the  court  a  proposed  consent  decree .order  and  copy  of  the \ndesegregation  plan.  The  most  controversial  aspect  of  this  plan \nwas  the  proposed  merger  of  the  virtually  all-black  Boston  High \nSchool  and  the  integrated  Lake  Charles  High  School,  located  only \nthree  blocks  away.  On  July  15,  1982,  the  district court  in  a \nmemorandum  order  noted  the  plan  but  neither  approved  nor \ndisapproved  of  it,  relying  instead  on  the  S~hool Board's  own \nability  to make  any  changes  and  adjustments  in  the  original \ndesegregation  plan  that  do  not  conflict  with  this  Court's  1970 \nopinion. \nOn  January  20,  1983,  Basile Miller,  individually  and \nfor  a  class,  sued  the  School  Board,  presumably  in  an  effort  to \nblock  the  Boston-Lake  Charles  High  merger.  Upon  suggestion  by \nthe  district court,  Miller  converted  his  complaint  into  a \npetition  for  intervention  in  the  pending  desegregation  case.  On \nJune  1,  1983,  after  a  full  he~ring,  the  district court  denied \nintervention.  On  appeal,  we  affirmed  but  held  that  Miller  could \nresubmit  his motion  to  the  district court  if a  hearing  on \napproval  of  the  plan  pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.

Calcasieu  Parish  School \nBoard,  No.  83-4402  (5th  Cir.  Nov.  7,  (unpublished). \n~983) \nOn  September  1,  1983,  Homer  Singleton,  current  counsel \nfor  appellants,  together  with  Richard  Ieyoub,  another  attorney, \nfiled  a  Motion  to Enroll  as  counsel  for  Lawrence  Conley,  a  black \nmember  of  the  Calcasieu  Parish  community  whose  children  attended \nCalcasieu  public  schools  at  the  time  this  desegregation  case  was \ncommenced  and  were  original  named  plaintiffs  therein.  The \ndistrict court  on  November  30  denied  enrollment,  but  reserved  to \nthe  movers  the  right  to  refile  their  motion  once  the  rule  23(e) \nhearing  on  the  proposed  plan  was  held.  On  December  9,  1983, \nSingleton  requested  the  district court  to  reconsider  its motion \nto  enroll  as  counsel,  but  this  request  was  again  denied. \nPursuant  to  the  opinion  of  this  Cnurt,  the  district \ncourt  met  with  the  parties  on  November  30,  1983,  to  schedule  a \nrule  23(e)  hearing  date  and  to.set deadlines  for  filing  of  the \nNotice  of  Proposed  Compromise  and  Settlement.  Such  notice  was \nsubmitted  on  December  12,  1983,  and  was  published  in  a  local \nnewspaper  on  December  16,  23,  and  30.  Thereafter,  the  district \ncourt  accepted  written objections  to  the  proposed  consent  decree \nand,  at  the  hearing  held  on  January  30  and  31,  1984,  meticulously \n1 \nRule  23(e)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil Procedure \nprovides:  \"A  class  action  shall  not  be  dismissed  or  compromised \nwithout  the  approval  of  the  court,  and  notice  of  the  proposed \ndismissal  or  compromise  shall  be  given  to  all members  of  the \nclass  in  such  manner  as  the  court  directs.\" \n-4-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 5 of 17 PageID #:  382\nprovided  all  interested  persons  the  opportunity  express  fully \n~o \ntheir  views  in  open  court.  During  the  course  of  the  testimony, \nthe  court  also  granted  all persons  in  attendance,  including \nSingleton,  the  opportunity  to  question  all witnesses  concerning \ntheir  views  of  the  proposed  plan.  After  the  hearings,  the \ndistrict  court  approved  the  compromised  plan  with  modifications \non  April  3,  1984. \nApproximately  one  month  later,  a  notice  of  joint  appeal \nfrom  the  district court's April  3  ruling  was  filed  by  Singleton, \npurporting  to  represent  himself  pro  se  and  Lawrence  Conley, \nDennis  Ware,  II,  Earl Lawrence  Ringo,  and  Harold  L.  Lewis,  Sr., \nindividually  and  as  class  representatives,  as  well  as  Basile \nMiller,  Howard  Oliver  (on  behalf  of  his  grandchildren),  and  Alvin \nand  Rosemary  Narcisse  (on  benalf  of  their  minor  son) •  On  appeal, \nthe  School  Board  challenges  as  an  initial matter  both  the \nstanding  of  these  individual  appellants  to  bring  this  appeal  and \nSingleton's·authority  to  represent  the  class.  To  these \ncontentions  of  the  School  Board  we  now  turn. \nII. \nAt  the  outset  we  make  two  observations  about  the  nature \nof  the  plainti£f  class  that  will  be  helpful  in  resolving  the \nissues  before  us.  First,  we  point  out  that,  while  the  district \ncourt  treated  the  case  as  a  class  action,  there  is  nothjng  in  the \nrecord  indicating  that  the  case  was  ever  certified  as  such.  No \n-5-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 6 of 17 PageID #:  383\ndoubt  the  absence  of  a  certification order  resulted  from  '·he  fact \nthat  the  instant  case  was  instituted  iQ  1964,  at  which  1  ~me rule \n23  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil Procedure  did  not  require \ncertification.

In Graves,  the \ndistrict court  had  never  certified  the  class  action,  and  the \nclaims  of  the  original plaintiffs  were  mooted  by  their \ngraduation.  We  nevertheless  held  that  the  case  was  in  fact  a \nclass  action  on  the  ground  that  it was  specifically described  and \ntreated  as  one  by  the  parties  and  the  trial court  throughout  its \nlong  history.  686  F.2d  at  1140.  The  class  action  status  of  the \ninstant  case  likewise  was  never  questioned  during  its  twenty \nyears  of  pendency  by  either  the  trial court  or  the  parties,  all \nof  whom  consistently  described  the  case  in  class  action  terms. \nIndeed,  we  ourselves  in Mill€r  v.  Calcasieu  Parish  School  Board, \nsupra,  treated  without  hesitation  the  case  as  a  class  action. \nUnuer  1:hese  circumst.:m::es,  \"[t]o  state  at  this  late  date  that \nthis  was  not  a  class  action,  'would  be  to  ignore  the  substance  of \nthe  proceeding  below  in  favor  of  an  exce~sively formalistic \nadherence  to  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil Procedure.'\"  Senter  v. \nGeneral  Motors  Corp.,  532  F. 2d  511,  522  (6th  Cir.)  (quoting  Bing \nv.

Defendant's  Offer  of  Proof \n-7-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 8 of 17 PageID #:  385\n#2,  at  1.  That  the  composition  of  the  class  has  not  been  changed \nin  the  intervening  twenty  or  so  years  was  made  clear  by  the \ndistrict court's  affirmation  during  the  rule  23(e)  hearing  that \nthe  action  \"is  a  suit  by  black  named  individuals  and  black \nchildren  against  the  Calcasieu  Parish  School  Board.\"  Record  Vol. \n5,  at  10.  Indeed,  the  appellants  concede  as  much.3  .There  thus \nappears  to  be  no  question  that  class  membership  in  this  case  is \nconfined  to  those  black  children  eligible  to  attend  public  school \nin Calcasieu  Parish  and  their  parents. \nIII. \nThe  School  Board  asserts  that Singleton  is  not  entitled \nto  prosecute  this  appeal  on  behalf  of  any  of  the  appellants  he \npurportedly  represents.  In  addressing  this  contention,  we \nconsider  in  turn  the  ability of  Singleton  to  maintain  the  appeal . \non  behalf  of  each  appellant. \nA.  The  Class  Itself.  It  is  axiomatic  that  a  class  as \na  whole  has  standing  to  appeal  an  order  of  the  district court \nentered  in  the  class  action.  It  is  also  clearly  established, \nhowever,  that  only  counsel  properly  enrolled  can  represent  the \nclass  before  the  court.  This  requirement  results  from  the \nobligation of  the  court  to  ensure  that  \"the  representative \n3 \nBrief  of Appellants,  at  13. \n-8-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 9 of 17 PageID #:  386\nparties  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of  the \nclass.\"  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a) (4).  As  we  have  observed \npreviously  with  respect  to  making  such  a  determination,  \"[courts] \nfocus  on  the  attorney,  as  well  as  the  named  parties  because  they \nrealize  the  important  role  the  attorney  plays  in  protecting  the \ninterests  of  the  class.\"  Notth  American  Acceptance  Corp. \nSecurities  Cases  v.  Arnall,  Golden  & Gregory,  593  F.2d  642,  644 \nn.4  (5th  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  444  u.s.  956  (1979) 1  see  also \nCullen  v.  New  York  State  Civil Service  Comm'n,  566  F.2d  846,  848 \n(2d  Cir.  1977)  (\"court's  review  of  adequacy  of  counsel  •••  is \ncentral  to  a  finding  of  adequacy  of  representation\");  3B  J.  Moore \n& J.  Kennedy,  Moore's  Federal  Practice  ~  23.07[1.-1]  (Supp.  1983-\n84)  (in  deciding  adequacy  of  named  parties,  courts  examine  the \nqualifications  of  the  class  attorney). \nThis  is  not  to  say,  of  course,  that  the  class  counsel \nwho  is  currently  enrolled  when  an  appealable  order  or  judgment  is \nentered  by  a district court  possesses  the  authority  to  determine \nwhether  to  appeal.  Clearly,  \"at  least as  an  initial matter,  the \ndecision  to  appeal  a·class  action  judgment  must  rest  with  the \nclass  plaintiffs.\"  Pettway  v.  American  Cast  Iron  Pipe  Co.,  576 \nF.2d  1157,  1177-78  (5th  Cir.  1978),  cert.  denied,  439  U.S.  1115 \n(1979).  Thus,  we  held  in Rettway  that,  if.the  named  plaintiffs \nwish  to  appeal  on  behalf  of  the  class  contrary  to  the  best \njudgment  of  the  class  counsel,  \"the  district court  must  exercise \nits discretion  in  deciding  whether  to  substitute  class  counsel  to \n-9-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 10 of 17 PageID #:  387\nallow  the  named  plaintiffs  to  maintain  the  appeal.\"  Id.  at \n1178.  In  Pettway,  we  listed  a  number  of  factors  that  should \ninform  the  exercise  of  that  discretion. \nIn  the  instant  case,  the  district  court  never  had  the \nopportunity  to  exercise  its discretion  since  the  named  plaintiffs \nnever  moved  the  district court  to  substitute  class  counsel. 4  In \nthe  absence  of  a  ruling  on  such  a  motion,  we  are  powerless  to \npermit  this  appeal.  Indeed,  one  of  the  purposes  for  requiring \nthe  district court  to  make  the  initial decision  as  to \nsubstitution  is  to  ensure  that  the  determination  and  our \nsubsequent  review  thereof  are  made  upon  a  sufficient  factual \npredicate.  On  the  present  state  of  the  record,  we  have  no  way  of \nknowing,  for  example,  to  what  degree  the  named  plaintiffs or \nabsent  class members  consider  the  appeal  to  be  in  tneir  interest \nor  the  adequacy  of  the  proposed  new  class  counsel.  Under  such \ncircumstances,  we  find  that  this  appeal  cannot  be  maintained  by \nSingleton  as  counsel  for  the  class. \nB.  Nonclass  Members.  Singleton  also  prosecutes  this \nappeal  on  behalf  of  several  persons,  including  himself,  who  are \nnot  named  plaintiffs  or  even  absent  members  of  the  class.5  In \n4 \n. Singleton  did  seek  to  enroll  as  counsel  for  Lawrence \nConley,  one  of  the  named  plaintiffs who  originally  brought  this \nsuit  as  next  friend  to  his  children.  In  his  reply  brief  on  the \nmotion  to  enroll,  however,  Singleton explicitly  stated  that  he \nsought  to  enroll  as  counsel  only  for  Conley,  not  for  the  class. \nRecord  Vol.  2,  at  192. \n-10-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 11 of 17 PageID #:  388\nhis  brief,  Singleton  recognizes  the  fact  that  these  persons  are \nnot  named  plaintiffs or  class members,  but  contends  that·their \nparticipation  in  the  rule  23(e)  hearing  conferred  upon  them \nintervenor  status  by  implication.6  We  find  this  claim  to  be \nmeritless. \nIt  is  firmly  established  that  the  proper  course  for \nparental  groups  or  other  affected  citizens  seeking  to  present \ncomplaints  arising  out  of  desegregation  litigation  is  a  petition \nfor  intervention.  Graves  v.  Walton  County  Board  of Education, \nsupra,  at  1140;  Pate  v.  Dade  County  School Board,  588  F.2d  501, \n503  (5th  Cir.),  cert.  denied,  444  u.s.  835  (1979).  The  purpose \nof  such  a  petition  is  to  \"bring  to  the  attention  of  the  district \ncourt  the  precise  issues  which  the  new  group  [seeks]  to  represent \nand  the  ways  in  which  the  goal  of  a  unitary  system  had \n~llegedly \nbeen  frustrated.\"  Hines  v.  R~pides Parish  School Board,  479  F.2d \n762,  765  (5th  Cir.  1973).  Intervention  is  thus  properly  denied \nif  the  issues  presented  by  the  new  group  were  already  considered \nor  \"if  the  existing  parties  were  aware  of  those  issues  and  were \n5 \nThese  appellants  are  Basile Miller,  Howard  Oliver \n(on  behalf  of  his  grandchildren),  Alvin  and  Rosemary  Narcisse  (on \nbehalf  of  their  minor  son),  and  Homer  c.  Singleton.  Miller  is \nblack  but  childless;  the  other  appellants  apparently  are  white \nwith  children  enrolled  in  the  Calcasieu  Parish School  system. \n6  Singleton  alternatively  asserts  that  these \nappellants  were  properly  before  the  court  as  amici  curiae.  We \nrej~ct this  argument  out  of hand.  Such  a  status  -- even  assuming \nit to  have  been  conferred  -- would  not  provide  the  appellants \nwith  the  authority  to  bring  an  appeal  in  their  own  right. \n-11-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 12 of 17 PageID #:  389\ncomnletely  competent  to  represent  the  interests  of  the  new \ngroup.\"  Davis  v.  East Baton  Rouge  Parish  School  Board,  721  F.2d \n1425,  1441  (5th  Cir.  1983). \nThe  appellants  here  have  failed  to  file  a  petition  for \nintervention  in  district court  and  rely  instead  on  their \nparticipation  in  the  rule  23(e)  hearing  as  to  somehow  entitle \nthem  to  intervenor  status.  We  think  it clear  from  the  principles \narticulated  above,  however,  that  at  least  in  the  class  action \ncontext  intervention  can  only  be  accomplished  through  formal \ncompliance  with  rule  24  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \nProcedure.  The  requirement  of  intervention  performs  a  screening \nfunction  vital  to  the  manageability  of  class  actions.  It would \nbe  inimical  to  this  funclion  to  allow  a  party  to  avoid  the \nobstacle  of  formal  intervention  by  simply  participating  in  a \ngeneral  fact-finding  hearing  such  as  the  one  conducted  in  the \ninstant  case  by  the  district court.  Thus,  because  the  nonclass \nmember  appellants  have  failed  properly  to  intervene  according  to \nrule  24,  we  find  that  they  lack  standing  to  maintain  this \n7 \nappeal.\n7 \nWe  add  parenthetically  that,  even  if  the  appellants \nlisted  in  supra  note  5  were  absent  class  members,  they  would \nstill be  required  to  intervene  before  directly  participating  in \nthis  litigation.

Surtran  Taxicabs,  Inc.,  684  F.2d  324  (5th  Cir. \n1982). \n-12-\n.. \n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 13 of 17 PageID #:  390\n' \n. \n~  Named  Plaintiffs.  The  last group  of  appellants \nallegedly  represented  by  Singleton  are  certain  named  plaintiffs \nof  the  original  action.a  Although  Singleton  filed  a  notice  of \nappeal  on  behalf  of  these  individuals,  our  review  of  the  record \nreveals  that Singleton  has  never  been  enrolled  as  counsel  for  any \nof  them  and  has  previously  sought  enrollment  only  for  Lawrence \n9 \nConley. We  find  moreover  that  each  named  plaintiff  except  for \nConley  agreed  in  writing  to  be  represented  by  the  class  counsel10 \nand  apparently  has  never  revoked  or  sought  to  revoke  this \nagreement.  Based  on  these  facts,  we  conclude  that Singleton  is \nwithout  authority  to  represent  the  named  plaintiffs  with  the \n• \nexception  of  Conley. \nWith  respect  to Conley,  we  assume  arguendo  that \nSingleton  is  authorized  t6  represent  him  for  purposes  of  this \nappeal.  For  the  following  reasons,  however,  we  conclude  that \nConley  lacks  standing  to  prosecute  this  appeal. \nIh  Sosna  v.  Iowa,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that,  \"[w]hen \nthe  District Court  certifie[s]  the  propriety of  the  class  action, \n8  These  are  Lawrence  Conley,  Dennis  Ware,  II,  Earl \nLawrence  Ringo,  and  Harold  L.  Lewis,  Sr. \n9 \nSee  supra  note  4.  Conley  was  also  the  sole  named \nplaintiff  to  testify  against  the  consent  decree  at _the  rule  23(e) \nhearing. \n10 \nSee  Plaintiff's Offer  of  Proof  #1  (affidavit  signed \n· by  named  plaintiffs  affirming  their  retention  of  class  counsel \nfor  representation  \"in  all matters  pertaining  to  and  arising  from \nthis  litigation\"). \n-13-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 14 of 17 PageID #:  391\nthe  class  of  unnamed  ~~rsons described  in  the  certificate \nacquire[s]  a  legal  status  separate  from  the  interest asserted  by \nthe  appellant.\"  419  u.s.  393,  399  (1975);  see  also United \nStates Parole  Comm'n  v.  Geraghty,  445  u.s.  388  (1980).  Thus,  the \nmootness  of  a  named  plaintiff's  individual  claim  does  not  render \na  class  action moot.  A corollary of  this  principle  is  that  the \ncontinued  vitality of  the  stake  shared  by  members  of  the  in \nclas~ \nthe  class  action  does  not  save  a  named  plaintiff's claim  from \nbecoming  moot.  Once  a  named  plaintiff's claim  is mooted, \ntherefore,  his  involvement  in  the  class  action  would  be  confined \nto  representing  the  class. \nBased  on  the  foregoing,  we  find  that  Conley  lacks  the \nability  tu  bring  this  appeal.  As  described  above,  the  plaintiff \nclass  consists  of  those  black  children  enrolled  in  the  Calcasieu \nParish  school  system  and  their  parents.  Conley,  however, \nconceded  at  the  rule  23(e)  hearing  that  his  children  had  long \nsince  graduated.  Thus,  Conley's  claim  has  become  moot.  See \nLaurenzo  v.  Mississippi  High  School  Activities Ass'n,  662  F.2d \n1117,  1120-21  (5th  Cir.  1981);  Johnson  v.  City  of  Opelousas,  658 \nF.2d  1065,  1068-69  (5th  Cir.  1981).  As  a  result,  we  conclude \nthat  Conley  lacks  standing  to  bring  this  appeal. \nIII. \nBecause  Singleton  has  not  been  enrolled  as  class \ncounsel,  he  has  no  authority  to  bring  this  appeal  on  behalf  of \n-14-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 15 of 17 PageID #:  392\nA \n-\nthe  class.  In  addition,  we  that  none  of  the  individual \nfir~ \nappellants  represented  by  Singleton  has  standing  to  appeal. \nAccordingly,  this  appeal  is  dismissed. \nDISMISSED. \n-15-\n\nCase 2:80-cv-01709-PM   Document 5-2   Filed 05/01/12   Page 16 of 17 PageID #:  393\n:l!(nitt~ 81att.a OJnurt nf 1\\pptal.a \nFIFTH CIRCUIT \nGILBERT F.
