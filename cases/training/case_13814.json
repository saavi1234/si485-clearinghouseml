Present were Teresa Yeh and Jonathan Newton, counsel for the Department of Justice, and Tyler Storms, counsel for Grambling High Foundation/Lincoln Preparatory School. Mr. Storms had raised the issue of a possible need to use the Grambling State University (\"GSU\") football facilities for a district play-off game. For this week's game, Lincoln Prep will use the Louisiana Tech University facilities. If Lincoln Prep moves forward in the playoffs and if no other facility is available, Mr. Storms will file a motion to use the GSU football facilities, detailing Lincoln Prep's efforts to find another location. Mr. Storms does anticipate Lincoln Prep's need to use the basketball facilities at GSU for the upcoming season because Lincoln Prep has not yet completed building its own gym. He was instructed to file a motion on that issue. Currently, GHF/Lincoln Prep's Motion to Dismiss [doc. #398] is pending before the Court. The notice of motion setting [doc. #399] on that motion is VACATED. GHF/Lincoln Prep has until January 15, 2022, to supplement its motion with evidentiary support. Additionally, Louisiana Tech University/A.E. Phillips Laboratory School is permitted, under the consent decree, to file a motion to dismiss with ninety (90) days of the October 15, 2021 status report. Once Louisiana Tech/AEP's motion to dismiss is filed (on or after January 15, 2022), the Court will set a briefing schedule on both motions to dismiss. The Clerk of Court is instructed that no further notices of motion setting shall issue for the pending motion to dismiss or for any motion to dismiss filed by Louisiana Tech/AEP.

The Court ORDERED parties to file any supplemental briefs in support of or in opposition to the pending Motion to Dismiss within 10 days of the date of these minutes, or no later than July 29, 2016. The parties can then file replies to the opposing party's supplemental brief within 7 days, or no later than August 8, 2016. Following the Courts ruling on the Motion to Dismiss, the DOJ and AEP shall have thirty (30) days to revise the pending proposed consent decree [Doc. No. 171] consistent with actions that have taken place in the case in the ensuing six months since the motion was filed. The School Board has no opposition to the consent decree generally, only to the extent that the decree includes language indicating that the School Board has any involvement or liability with regard to AEP. The Court and the participants also discussed the status of the GHF and DOJ discussions. The parties could not reach agreement on the language of the order granting GHFs intervention in this case as a defendant. The Court agreed to review both orders and enter one of the orders or a modification of one or both shortly. The DOJ and GHF continue to negotiate a proposed consent decree. At the conclusion of the status conference, Mr. Newton, Mr. Jondahl, and Mr. DeCuir agreed to remain on the conference number, so they could attempt to resolve the remaining issues. The Emergency Motion for a Settlement Conference [Doc. No. 217] remains pending before Magistrate Judge Karen L. Hayes. The parties will contact Magistrate Judge Hayes by Friday, July 22, 2016, if they wish to proceed with a settlement conference. (crt,DickersonSld, D) (Entered: 07/19/2016)"

Instead, counsel for the DOJ will prepare a proposal and provide it to the other parties by September 30, 2013. ( Compliance Deadline set for 9/30/2013). The parties will also address the interplay of the School Board's pending request for unitary status and its remaining involvement in this case with regard to the laboratory school issues. On October 9, 2013, the parties will meet at 9:00 a.m. in the United States District Courthouse, Monroe, Louisiana, to discuss the DOJ's proposal and any responses.

The Court and counsel discussed the status reports recently filed with regard to the laboratory schools. Mr. Wardenski reported that AEP has taken additional voluntary steps to improve diversity of the student body. Mr. DeCuir reported that GSU has given notice that it will no longer operate the Laboratory School at the end of this school year. The Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education has approved a Type 2 charter application for the Grambling High Foundation, Inc., which would operate a K-12 school at the current location. GSU does intend to file a motion with the Court to transfer the laboratory school operation to the Grambling High Foundation. If these actions take place, Mr. Wardenski noted that AEP and GSU will be on different paths, and he anticipates a need to re-negotiate the 1984 Consent Decree. To that end, the Court set a deadline of October 23, 2015, for GSU to file its motion for authorization of transfer of operation of the laboratory school to the Grambling High Foundation. Once the motion is filed, the Court will set a telephone status conference to discuss the motion and procedures with counsel. Additionally, the Court set a deadline of December 7, 2015, for the parties to file a modified joint consent decree. (crt,DickersonSld, D) Modified on 10/1/2015 (DickersonSld, D).

    "summary": "<p>On June 8, 1966, the United States Department of Justice filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. The Department of Justice sued to enjoin the operation of a dual school system in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana. This lengthy case involves a number of appeals and consolidations with other school desegregation cases proceeding in parallel in the Western District of Louisiana.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Obtaining a Consent Decree</strong></p>\r\n<p>On July 28, 1966, the defendants&rsquo; counsel admitted that Lincoln Parish operated a segregated school system. The court (Judge Benjamin C. Dawkins Jr.) responded by requiring the School Board to submit a desegregation plan within five days. On August 3, 1966, the District Court ordered a &ldquo;phased in&rdquo; desegregation plan requiring the School Board to advertise that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 10th, 11th and 12th grades would be desegregated in the 1966-1967 school year. The School Board was also required to desegregate the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th grades in the 1967-1968 school year. Then on August 8, the Department of Justice filed exceptions to the School Board&rsquo;s proposed desegregation plans and proposed their own desegregation plan.</p>\r\n<p>No additional docket entries were made until March 31, 1967. One possibility for this gap is that the court decided to see how <a href=\"../../../../case/1050/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>United States v. Jefferson County School Board</em></a> would turn out. (This case was not, however, consolidated with <em>Jefferson</em>.) On December 29, 1966, the Fifth Circuit decided <em>Jefferson</em>, holding that the Constitution compels formerly de jure segregated public school systems to shift to non-racial systems. 372 F.2d 836 (1966). As schools continued to drag their feet in implementing desegregation orders, <em>Jefferson</em> was re-heard en banc. The Fifth Circuit ruled that school boards have an affirmative duty to bring about integrated, unitary school systems. 380 F.2d 385 (1967).</p>\r\n<p>In this case, on April 5, 1967, the Department of Justice moved to stay the proceedings and requested a hearing on whether a new desegregation order should be entered in light. of Jefferson. While the docket is not entirely clear, it suggests that the court issued a decree on April 5, 1967 ordering the School Board to implement a freedom of choice plan (a plan that allowed students to choose which schools to attend). If so, the decision was in tension with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Green v. County School Board of New Kent County</em>, 391 U.S. 430 (1968), which expressed frustration at the use of freedom of choice plans to desegregate.</p>\r\n<p>The Fifth Circuit reconsidered the issue of freedom of choice plans in <em>Adams v. Mathews</em> in which many school desegregation cases, including this case, were consolidated. On August 20, 1968, the Fifth Circuit remanded the cases to a three-judge district court to reconsider the issue. 403 F.2d 181 (1968). On remand, on November 14, 1968, the three-judge district court approved freedom of choice plan in this and 28 other cases. <em>Conley v. Lake Charles School Board</em>, 293 F. Supp. 84 (W.D. La. 1968). The plaintiffs appealed <em>Conley</em>, and the Fifth Circuit finally rejected the use of freedom of choice plans. See <em>Hall v. St. Helena Parish School Board</em>, 417 F.2d 801 (1969). For more information on the Lake Charles and St. Helena cases, please see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13810\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> in the Clearinghouse.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, on August 1, 1969, the District Court issued a decree which incorporated a new desegregation plan for Franklin Parish that complied with the Fifth Circuit&rsquo;s decision in <em>St. Helena</em>. Modifications were made over the next two years, although their terms are not available on the docket.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Dawkins recused himself via a handwritten note on a motion on April 30, 1973. Judge Edwin F. Hunter replaced Judge Dawkins.</p>\r\n<p>On January 10, 1977, the Department of Justice made a motion to consolidate this case with case with <em>Copeland v. Lincoln Parish School Board</em>. The court approved the consolidated of the two cases on January 31, 1977. The plaintiffs in Copeland consisted of parents of children in the district and the Grambling United League of Voters. The plaintiffs in <em>Copeland</em> sought to represent all black parents who had children in public school. The individual plaintiffs had obtained class certification, but the Voters League was dismissed because it lacked standing and was not a necessary party.</p>\r\n<p>The Copeland plaintiffs challenged the site selections for two new schools as racially motivated, because both were located within the same ward. The School Board contended that the chosen locations would reduce the number of student miles of transportation in a racially-balanced way.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the Copeland plaintiffs&rsquo; request, the Department of Justice moved on July 22, 1977 to add the laboratory schools at Grambling State University and Louisiana Tech University as defendants in order to litigate a modification of the consent decree to include these schools. The District Court denied both requests, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\r\n<p>On July 13, 1979, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court&rsquo;s determination that the Board&rsquo;s choice of locations for new schools was not racially motivated. The Fifth Circuit was satisfied that the School Board&rsquo;s committee studied each location with an eye to centrality, maintenance of racial balance, racially balanced decrease in overall student transportation mileage, ease of access and availability of transportation arteries, accessibility of utilities, and size and shape compatible with planned construction, further expansion, and community growth. In addition, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that &ldquo;because the composition of the Grambling and Louisiana Tech schools clearly lay outside the scope of the consent decree, the School Board officials reasonably disregarded those schools in its selection of sites.&rdquo; However, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court&rsquo;s exclusion of laboratory schools from the desegregation order. It reasoned that that the laboratory schools were initially established as part of a dual school system and for &ldquo;clarity,&rdquo; the cases should be consolidated so as to avoid &ldquo;possible duplicative actions and orders.&rdquo; 598 F.2d 977 (1979).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Obtaining Unitary Status</strong></p>\r\n<p>After years of reports, the district court in 2009 starting meeting with the parties in all active desegregation cases to determine what steps needed to be taken to achieve unitary status. On May 24, 2012, District Judge Robert G. James approved a superseding consent decree requiring the School Board to take additional actions to comply with student assignment obligations. 2016 WL 1651873 (2016).</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2015, the District Court approved another supplemental consent decree negotiated by the School Board and the Department of Justice that would compel four elementary schools in the parish to re-assign students after 22 of the 87 homerooms in the four elementary schools at issue were classified as &ldquo;racially identifiable.&rdquo; The Department of Justice also agreed that the School Board could then move for a declaration of unitary status on the issue of student assignment.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2015, Grambling State University, a historically Black university, made a motion to transfer the Grambling Laboratory Schools to Grambling High Foundation (&ldquo;GHF&rdquo;). The motion was modified twice before the District Court finally decided on April 25, 2016 that Grambling State University and Louisiana Tech could close the laboratory schools due to a significant reduction in funding. The motion to close the laboratory schools was not opposed by any of the other parties in the litigation. The District Court also approved the Grambling State and Louisiana Tech motion to transfer control of the laboratory schools to GHF, a new charter school, but only if GHF was subject to the desegregation conditions in the 1984 consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>On May 4, 2016, GHF moved to intervene, and the district court told the Department of Justice and GHF to negotiate a proposed order concerning the laboratory schools. On July 7, 2016, GHF filed an Emergency Motion for a settlement conference after reaching an impasse in negotiations with the Department of Justice. The District Court finally approved GHF&rsquo;s intervention on July 19, 2016. GHF and the Department of Justice again reached an impasse on two key issued on August 2, 2016 and GHF asked the court for permission to open. On August 4, 2016, the District Court granted GHF&rsquo;s oral motion for authorization to open a charter school for the 2016-2017 school year, albeit with the conditions that &ldquo;GHF would have a baseline of 370 students,&rdquo; &ldquo;will file a letter of financial commitment for the construction of new facilities no later than October 1, 2017&rdquo; and that the two parties &ldquo;will file a proposed consent decree no later than September 6, 2016&rdquo; or the two parties would be required to &ldquo;file separate proposed desegregation plans&rdquo; by that same date. On August 15, 2016, the district court released the School Board for any obligation relative to the Grambling Laboratory Schools or AEP (Louisiana Tech Laboratory School).</p>\r\n<p>On January 18, 2017, the District Court granted the School Board unitary status after finding that the School Board met its obligations in the 2012 superseding consent decree and the 2015 supplemental consent decree.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly thereafter on August 1, 2017 Judge James ordered GHF to increase its enrollment of white students enrolled at its Lincoln Prep school to be within 20% of the number of white students enrolled in Lincoln Parish schools and placed a cap on the number of Black students who could enroll in the school. He also ordered GHF to meet certain enrollment targets, provide annual reports to the court, and increase the quality of the education it provided in various ways.</p>\r\n<p>On June 14, 2019, after two years of reporting, Judge James found that GHF had not enrolled enough white students and was not in compliance with his earlier orders. However, he permitted GHF to continue operating its Lincoln Prep school for another school year.</p>\r\n<p>In March of 2019, GHF moved for both a declaration of unitary status and to have the case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that there was no evidence that GSU's laboratory schools were de jure segregated. Judge James deferred ruling on both motions in the summer of 2019, but on January 8, 2020, he denied them both. He found that the GSU laboratory schools were \"identifiable as Black Schools,\" and thus he had subject matter jurisdiction to desegregate them. Judge James also denied GHF's motion for unitary status, as GHF was not in compliance with his earlier orders regarding the enrollment of Black students. He also noted that Lincoln Prep's \"poor facilities,\" location on the campus of a historically Black university, and academic issues were all \"barriers to desegregation. Accordingly, he ordered GHF to move Lincoln Prep to a location off of GSU's campus and limited the ways that Lincoln could draw on GSU's resources, such as banning Lincoln from using GSU's athletic facilities.</p>\r\n<p>The case remains pending.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Available Opinions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Adams v.

JAMES \n \nLINCOLN PARISH SCHOOL BOARD,    MAG. JUDGE KAREN L. HAYES \nET AL. \n \nMEMORANDUM RULING AND ORDER \nOn May 14-15, 2019, the Court held a hearing on its own motion to address the efforts of \nGrambling High Foundation (AGHF@) to comply with orders designed to achieve desegregation.   \nFor the following reasons, the Court finds that GHF is not in compliance with the orders \nof this Court, but will allow GHF to continue operation of Lincoln Preparatory School (ALincoln \nPrep@) for the 2019-2020 school year, given its good faith efforts.   \nI.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND   \nThis is a long-standing desegregation case to which the United States of America (Athe \nUnited States@), Louisiana State Superintendent of Education (AState Superintendent@), Louisiana \nBoard  of  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  (ABESE@),  University  of  Louisiana  System \n(AULS@), Louisiana Board of Regents (the ABoard of Regents@),1 Grambling State University \n(AGSU@), and Louisiana Tech University (ALa. Tech@) remain parties.   \nOn June 8, 1966, the United States filed a complaint in this Court against Defendant \nLincoln Parish School Board (ALPSB@), seeking to desegregate its de jure dual public school \nsystem.   On July 28, 1966, this Court entered a decree permanently enjoining LPSB from \n                                                 \n1Collectively, the Court refers to these Defendants as โthe State Defendants.โ \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 2 of 13 PageID #:  10137\noperating a racially segregated school system.  On August 1, 1969, the Court entered an order \ndirecting LPSB to Atake affirmative action to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate \nthe effects of the dual school system@ and to adopt a desegregation plan.   \nNeither the Grambling Lab Schools, a public laboratory school located on the campus of \nGSU, or the A.E. Phillips Laboratory School (AAEP@), a public laboratory school located on the \ncampus of La. Tech, were parties to the original action.    \nAs a result of further litigation, in 1980, this Court added the State Defendants, GSU (as \noperator of the Grambling Lab Schools), and La. Tech (as operator of AEP).  [Doc. Nos. 82-16, \n82-17 & 82-20].  AThe state became involved in this action because the laboratory schools are run \nby the Louisiana State Board of Education and the respective university officials.@ [Doc. No. \n82-21].  AThe racial composition of these two [lab] schools became an issue in the [LPSB] case@ \nbecause of its role as a conduit for funds and materials to the lab schools, providing transportation \nto their students, and approving faculty selections.   Id. at p. 1.   \nOn July 13, 1984, the Court entered a Consent Decree, agreed upon and signed by the \nUnited States, the State of Louisiana (the AState@), GSU, La. Tech, and LPSB.  The 1984 Consent \nDecree required GSU, La. Tech, and LPSB to take a number of actions intended to desegregate \nthe laboratory schools at the two universities.  [Doc. No. 82-3, pp. 4-24]. \nFor many years, no action was taken in this case with regard to any parties.   \nUpon its own motion on August 14, 2008, the Court amended the 1970 Decree, reactivating \nthis case and requiring LPSB to file an annual statistical report.  [Doc. No. 2].  On December 14, \n2009, this Court ordered the United States to conduct a unitary status review.  See [Doc. No. 8].  \nDuring the course of that review, the United States identified continuing issues related to the \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 3 of 13 PageID #:  10138\ndesegregation of the lab schools, which it summarized for the Court in its May 24, 2011 Status \nReport [Doc. No. 25].     \nOn May 13, 2013, the United States filed a Motion for Further Relief [Doc. No. 82] seeking \na new desegregation plan for the laboratory schools.  La. Tech and GSU opposed the United \nStates= motion, and each university cross-filed for a declaration of unitary status [Doc. Nos. 97-98, \n104-105].  LPSB filed a motion to dismiss itself from the litigation regarding the lab school issues \n[Doc. No. 102].  Following briefing on the parties= various motions, the Court directed the parties \nto engage in negotiations to attempt to resolve the lab school issues.  See [Doc. No. 118, pp. 1-2]. \nThe United States proposed options to desegregate the lab schools to GSU and the other \nDefendants on November 12, 2013.  See [Doc. No. 122].  On January 6, 2014, the United States \nmet with counsel for GSU and the other Defendants to further discuss the proposals to resolve the \noutstanding desegregation issues involving the lab schools.  See id. at p. 2.  The United States, \nGSU, and the other parties met with the Court on March 10, 2014, for further negotiations.  See \n[Doc. No. 124, pp. 2-3].  During the conference, GSU informed the Court and the parties that, in \npartnership with GSU and the City of Grambling, GHF had sought permission from LPSB to \nconvert GSU=s lab schools to a Type 3 charter school and would seek permission from BESE for \na Type 2 charter after receiving LPSB=s anticipated rejection.   See id. at p. 2.   \nGHF did not receive permission from LPSB to convert to a Type 3 charter school and \nproceeded with obtaining a Type 2 charter.  On August 12, 2015, GHF received conditional \napproval from BESE for a Type 2 charter school, pending LDOE review.  After the State \nSuperintendent confirmed that GHF met all standards for approval, GSU filed an Amended Motion \nand Brief [Doc. Nos. 170, 170-1] on January 27, 2016, seeking the Courtโs authorization to convert \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 4 of 13 PageID #:  10139\nthe Grambling Lab Schools to a charter school and to transfer control and governance of the charter \nschool to GHF.  The United States opposed GSU=s Amended Motion to the extent that it sought \nto operate the charter school without any obligations to desegregate and to eliminate the vestiges \nof the de jure segregation.  See [Doc. No. 200]. \nOn April 20, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing regarding GSU=s Motion and Amended \nMotion [Doc. Nos. 157, 170].  See [Doc. No. 205].  On April 25, 2016, the Court issued a Ruling \nand Order granting GSU=s motion in part and denying it in part.  See [Doc. No. 211]; [Doc. No. \n212].  The Court granted GSU=s request to close the lab schools at the end of the 2015-2016 school \nyear, but denied GSU=s request to transfer control of the former Grambling Lab Schools to GHF \nwithout desegregation obligations.  The Court granted the request Aonly if GHF accepts the \ntransfer subject to GSU=s desegregation obligations and under the other conditions detailed in this \nRuling.@  [Doc. No. 211, pp. 8-9].  Those conditions included the following requirements: (i) \nGHF Awill enroll in this matter immediately@; (ii) GSU, Awhile no longer operating the Laboratory \nSchools, will remain a party to this action to facilitate the transfer and to assist the Court with any \nissues that may arise with the charter school@; and (iii) GSU and GHF Awill work with the United \nStates to develop a new consent decree to replace the 1984 Consent Decree and to develop a plan \nwhich is reasonably calculated to address the goals of desegregation and to allow the new charter \nschool to obtain unitary status.@ [Doc. No. 211, p. 8]. \nOn July 19, 2016, the Court granted GHF=s motion to intervene.   [Doc. No. 221]. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 5 of 13 PageID #:  10140\nOn August 2, 2016, the parties participated in a settlement conference.  After the parties \nreached an impasse, GHF made an oral motion for authorization to open Lincoln Prep for the \n2016-2017 school year.  See [Doc. No. 230, p. 7].  The United States opposed the oral motion.  \nSee id. at pp. 7-8.  After conducting an emergency hearing on August 2, the Court authorized GHF \nto begin operating Lincoln Prep as a K-12 charter school in the 2016-2017 school year, subject to \nseveral conditions: (i) Lincoln Prep Awill have a baseline of 370 students@; (ii) GHF Awill file a \nletter of financial commitment for the construction of new facilities no later than October 1, 2017@; \nand (iii) GHF and the United States Awill file a proposed consent decree no later than September \n6, 2016 . . . . [or] separate proposed desegregation plans for the charter school with argument in \nsupport thereof.@  Id. at p. 12.   \nOn August 15, 2016, the Court granted in part and denied in part GSU=s Motion to Dismiss \n[Doc. No. 105].  To the extent that GSU moved the Court to find the Grambling Laboratory \nSchools unitary, the motion was denied as moot. [Doc. No. 234].  To the extent that GSU moved \nfor its dismissal from this case based on its obligations to the Grambling Laboratory Schools, the \nmotion was granted in part.  However, the motion was denied to the extent that GSU sought its \ncomplete dismissal from this case. The Court ruled that GSU remain a party to facilitate the transfer \nof the Grambling Laboratory Schools to GHF, to assist with any issues that may arise with the \ncharter school, and to work toward developing a plan for the charter schools which is reasonably \ncalculated to address the goals of desegregation and to allow the school to obtain unitary status. \nOn January 18, 2017, the Court found LPSB had achieved unitary status and dismissed the \ncase against it.  However, GSU, GHF, La. Tech, and the State Defendants remained parties in this \naction.  See [Doc. Nos. 265 & 266].   \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 6 of 13 PageID #:  10141\nThere continued to be issues with the desegregation of Lincoln Prep.  During the 2016-\n2017 school year, Lincoln Prep had a white student enrollment of about 3.2%.  A hearing was \nheld in this matter on July 20, 2017, after the United States and GHF failed to reach an agreement \non certain provisions of a proposed order for the upcoming school year.  During the hearing, GHF \norally moved for modification of those conditions of operation imposed in August 2016.  The \nUnited States opposed the motion and urged the Court to adopt the proposed order in its entirety. \n    On August 1, 2017, the Court issued a Memorandum Order [Doc. No. 287] granting in part \nand denying in part GHFโs oral motion and issuing an Interim Order (โthe Interim Orderโ).  In \npart, the Interim Order provided that GHF โshall, by the 2020-2021 school year, increase the \npercentage of white students enrolled at Lincoln Prep, so that it is within plus or minus 20 \npercentage points of the percentage of white students enrolled in grades K-12 in LPSBโs schools.  \nGFH will thereafter exercise good faith efforts to maintain the percentage of white students \nenrolled in the school within that range.โ  [Doc. No. 287, pp. 11-12].  To reach the ultimate 2020-\n2021 school year target, beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the Court limited black student \nenrollment to 360 students, but allowed GHF to enroll as many white students and students of \nother races as permitted by their state charter.  Id. at p. 13.  Additionally, the Court set white \nstudent enrollment targets for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years:2 \nBeginning with the 2017-2018 school year, GHF will have a percentage enrollment \nof 8% white students. For the following school year, 2018-2019, GHF will have a \npercentage enrollment of 14% white students. GHF will take affirmative measures-\nvia an actively managed enrollment process-to reach the annual white student \nenrollment targets for each entering kindergarten class and for higher grade levels. \n \n                                                 \n2The Court did not set targets for the 2019-2020 school year, with the idea that the parties would continue \nto work together in good faith and would seek guidance and/or rulings from the Court if necessary.  See [Doc. No. \n287, p. 19].   \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 7 of 13 PageID #:  10142\nId. at p. 12.  The Court set additional requirements for staffing, composition of the Board of \nDirectors, facilities, quality of education, transportation, and extracurricular activities.  Finally, \nthe Court continued the requirement that, on or before October 15 of each year, GHF must file a \nstatus report containing the identified information.   \n  In October 2017, GHF filed its status report and exhibits.  [Doc. Nos. 302 & 303].  At \nthat time, no status conference was requested.  \n  In October 2018, GHF filed its status report and exhibits.  [Doc. Nos. 313 & 314].  On \nOctober 30, 2018, the Court issued a minute entry [Doc. No. 316] setting a status conference for \nDecember 3, 2018. \n  On December 3, 2018, the Court held a status conference with counsel for the United \nStates, GHF, and GSU and the Courtโs law clerk.  The Court set deadlines for information \nrequested by the United States and further reminded counsel that GHF should be continuing to \nlook for a new location for Lincoln Prep.  \n  On February 7, 2019, in light of the appropriations lapse for Government agencies, \nincluding the DOJ, the Court granted an extension to February 28, 2019, for the United States to \nfile a memorandum addressing GHFโs status report and all additional information received.  The \nCourt then extended this deadline to March 11, 2019, on the United Statesโ motion. [Doc. No. \n322]. \n  On March 11, 2019, the United States filed a memorandum on GHFโs compliance with the \nInterim Order. [Doc. Nos. 323, 324 & 325].    \n  After reviewing the Lincoln Prep report and the United Statesโ response, the Court had  \nserious concerns about Lincoln Prepโs ongoing failure to reach complete compliance with the \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 8 of 13 PageID #:  10143\nCourtโs prior desegregation orders.  Therefore, the Court set a telephone status conference. \nOn March 18, 2019, the Court held a status conference with counsel, setting a hearing for \nApril 29, 2019, to address these concerns.  The Court also set discovery and briefing deadlines.  \n  After a tornado caused significant damage to the office and home of GHFโs counsel, the \nCourt re-set the hearing for May 14, 2019.  Trial briefs were timely filed before the hearing.  \n[Doc. Nos. 348, 349 & 352]. \n  An evidentiary hearing was held on May 14-15, 2019.  The Court heard testimony, via \nlive and video presentations, from GHFโs expert, Dr. Joanne Hood; Lincoln Prepโs director, Lt. \nCol. Gordon Ford; Lincoln Prep Senior Assistant Director, Melanie Colvin, and Assistant Director \nPhadra Burks Blake; Dr. Birdex Copeland; and the United Statesโ experts, Dr. Claire Smrekar and \nJames Brewer.3      \nII.   REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE ADDUCED PRIOR TO AND \n   AT THE HEARING \n \n  Much of the evidence and testimony presented was known to the Court and has not \nchanged since these issues were initially addressed.  All parties were aware, and the Court \ncertainly credits Dr. Smrekarโs testimony then and at the recent hearing, that GHF faced an \nuphill battle to recruit white students.  However, it was the Courtโs intent to give GHF a fair \nopportunity to achieve desegregation and to continue operation.   \n  To do so, the Court imposed certain conditions.  The Court has considered the evidence \nrelevant to each of these conditions. \n \n                                                 \n3 The Court also heard testimony from Mindy Lewis, a former white student at the Grambling Lab Schools, \nbut the Court finds that her testimony, while of historical relevance, was not relevant to the particular issue before \nthe CourtโGHFโs compliance with the Interim Order. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 9 of 13 PageID #:  10144\nA.   Recruitment, Enrollment, and Retention of White Students \nFirst, the Court set increasing white student enrollment targets over a period of years to \npermit GHF time to desegregate Lincoln Prep by the 2020-21 school year.  The Court \nestablished white student enrollment targets of 8% and 14% at Lincoln Prep for the 2017-18 and \n2018-19 school years, respectively.  It is undisputed that GHF has failed to meet the Interim \nOrderโs white student enrollment targets for both years.  As of the 2018-19 school year, GHF \nhad only 34 white students (7.8%) enrolled out of 437 total students, an increase of only half a \npercentage point over the past year.   \nTo comply with the Interim Order, GHF must increase Lincoln Prepโs white student \nenrollment by at least 17.3 percentage points before the 2020-2021 school year.  Based on the \nlack of progress between 2016 and 2019, it appears that GHFโs likelihood of success is slim.  \n  In March 2017, Lt. Col. Ford prepared a marketing and recruitment plan that adopted \nmost of the recommendations of the United Statesโ desegregation expert, Dr. Claire Smrekar,  in \nher 2016 Expert Report.  See [Doc. 323-5].  However, GHF has not relied on the 2017  \nmarketing plan or developed another particular written plan.  At the hearing, Lt. Col. Ford \ntestified about GHFโs strategic decision to delay recruitment until Lincoln Prep improved its \nscore from an โFโ school.  Lt. Col. Ford explained that they knew they would have little success \nin attracting white students to a school with a poor performance score.  The Court further heard \ntestimony from Col. Ford and employees Melanie Colvin and Phadra Burks Blake about GHFโs \nefforts to recruit and retain white students by targeting churches, festivals, and other events to \nrecruit white students, through efforts such as the Summer 2018 Roadshows. GHF also pointed \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 10 of 13 PageID #:  10145\nout its strategy of trying to attract white students who were being overlooked in the traditional \npublic school setting, but who could perform at higher levels if given the right tools and plans.  \n  Unfortunately, as Dr. Smrekar pointed out in her recent report and testimony, GHFโs lack \nof adherence to the March 2017 marketing plan is not the only problem with its efforts.  Even if \nGHF strategically delayed recruitment for the first two years, since that time, other than the \nSummer 2018 Roadshows, its recruitment efforts have largely been directed at promoting \nLincoln Prep to the general public, not a dedicated plan to recruit white students.  When it has \nengaged in marketing efforts, GHF has not taken actions to monitor and analyze these \nrecruitment efforts to see what has and has not worked and to improve the efficacy of its efforts.  \nSee [Doc. 323-1].   \n  Finally, white student departure remains of great concern to the Court.  It is not enough \nthat GHF recruit white students to attend Lincoln Prep.  In order to achieve desegregation, GHF \nmust retain the white students it recruits while recruiting additional students.  The Court set a \ntarget goal for white student enrollment, and a revolving door of the same small number of white \nstudents will not suffice to achieve that goal.  Until November 2018, GHF did not even collect \ndata on the reasons for departure of white students.  Since that time, GHF does not appear to \nhave tried to address such reasons for departure in order to prevent future departures.  While the \nCourt does believe that the administration, faculty, and staff of Lincoln Prep have acted in good \nfaith, good faith without substantial change is not enough.  At this point, the Court does not \nanticipate that GHF will be in compliance with the white student enrollment as required by the \nInterim Order for the 2020-2021 school year. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 11 of 13 PageID #:  10146\nB.  Facilities \nThe Court also finds that the Lincoln Prep facilities are a barrier to desegregation.  Even \nprior to the conversion from the Grambling Lab Schools to Lincoln Prep, the United States \npresented evidence and expert testimony to the Court about the poor condition of the facilities at \nthe former Grambling Lab Schools.  As part of the transfer of desegregation obligations to \nLincoln Prep, GHF agreed that it โmust provide an academic and extracurricular setting in \nfacilities that are comparable to those at schools in the surrounding area.โ  [Doc. No. 287].   \nAdditionally, from the very beginning, all parties agreed that GHF would have a greater \nchance of success with recruitment of white students if Lincoln Prep was not located on the campus \nof GSU.  As part of the initial authorization order, the Court required GHF to Afile a letter of \nfinancial commitment for the construction of new facilities no later than October 1, 2017.@ See \n[Doc. No. 230, p. 12].   \nHowever, Lincoln Prep did not obtain a financial commitment letter and remains located \non the campus of GSU.  The United Statesโ facilities expert, Mr. Brewer, who had previously \nevaluated Lincoln Prepโs facilities in comparison to AEP and the eight LPSB comparators, did so \nagain prior the recent hearing.  See [Doc. No. 323-2]; see also April 5, 2016 Brewer Expert \nReport [ Doc. 190-25]. Mr. Brewer concluded that โthe inferior physical condition of Lincoln \nPrep, compared to the eight local public school facilities [he] observed and [AEP], places \nLincoln Prep at a distinct disadvantage when competing with these schools for white students.โ  \n[Doc. No. 323-2]; Apr. 17, 2019 Brewer Trial Dep. at 32:5โ9.  In the past three years, GHF has \nnot made significant improvements to the Lincoln Prep facilities, nor has it obtained financing \nfor a comprehensive renovation or to construct or purchase another facility off the GSU campus.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 12 of 13 PageID #:  10147\nWhile Lt. Col. Ford credibly testified as to the difficulty of obtaining financing when the \nfuture of the school is uncertain, it has now become critical for GHF to move Lincoln Prep off \ncampus with comparable facilities to its comparators if it has any chance of achieving \ndesegregation.  It cannot be disputed that the objectively inferior physical condition of Lincoln \nPrep places GHF at a disadvantage when recruiting white students.  The condition and location \nof the facilities of Lincoln Prep must be addressed if the school is to be authorized for operation \nfor the 2020-2021 school year.     \nC.  Academic Achievement \nFinally, the Court has considered GHFโs duty under the Interim Order to โensure that it \nprovides a quality educationโ at Lincoln Prep by taking โgood faith stepsโ to โmaintain[ ] an \nappropriate, re-designed curriculum and employing certified teachers whenever possible.โ  \n[Doc. No. 287, ยง IV(D)]. \n  Lt. Col. Ford and other GHF witnesses testified to the academic improvement at Lincoln \nPrep and, specifically, to the increase in its school performance score.  The Court does not \ndiscount the value of the increased score or the efforts of teachers, faculty, and administration.  \nHowever, Lincoln Prep remains an academically low-performing school.  This, too, remains an \narea of concern for the Court. \nD.  Compliance and Authorization for the 2020-2021 School Year  \nAfter reviewing the evidence presented, the briefs, and the arguments, the Court finds \nthat GHF is not in compliance with the Courtโs Interim Order.  If GHF fails to file a financial \ncommitment letter by October 15, 2019, or fails to achieve a white student population of 20% by \nOctober 15, 2019, the Court is not likely to authorize GHF to operate Lincoln Prep on the \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 360   Filed 06/14/19   Page 13 of 13 PageID #:  10148\ncampus of GSU for the school year 2020-2021 or thereafter.4  GHF further remains bound by \nthe terms of the Interim Order, including the requirement of the vigorous and targeted \nrecruitment of white students.   \nIII.   CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons,  \nIT IS ORDERED that GHF is authorized to operate Lincoln Prep on the campus of GSU \nfor the 2019-2020 school year.  The Court anticipates that it may be required to withdraw \nauthorization unless GHF takes the steps set forth in this Memorandum Ruling and Order by \nOctober 15, 2019.   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the United Statesโ Motion for Judgment of a Matter of \nLaw [Doc. No. 353] is DENIED at this time, subject to re-urging at a later date. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that consideration of GHFโs pending motions [Doc. Nos. \n328 & 334] is DEFERRED at this time, subject to consideration after October 15, 2019, or earlier \nif circumstances change.   \nMONROE, LOUISIANA, this 14th day of June, 2019. \n \n       \n                                                 \n                 ROBERT G.

JAMES \n \nLINCOLN PARISH SCHOOL BOARD,    MAG. JUDGE KAREN L. HAYES \nET AL. \n \nMEMORANDUM RULING AND ORDER \nConsistent with the Courtโs notice to counsel in its November 8, 2019 status conference \n[Doc. No. 372] and after having reviewed responses from the parties, the Court finds that it is \nappropriate to enter this Memorandum Ruling and Order barring Grambling High Foundation \n(โGHFโ)  from  operating  Lincoln  Preparatory  School  (โLincoln  Prepโ)  on  the  campus  of \nGrambling State University and further ordering the conditions discussed herein. \nI.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND   \nThis is a long-standing desegregation case to which the United States of America (Athe \nUnited States@), Louisiana State Superintendent of Education (AState Superintendent@), Louisiana \nBoard  of  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  (ABESE@),  University  of  Louisiana  System \n(AULS@), Louisiana Board of Regents (the ABoard of Regents@),1 Grambling State University \n(AGSU@), and Louisiana Tech University (ALa. Tech@) remain parties.   \nOn June 8, 1966, the United States filed a complaint in this Court against Defendant \nLincoln Parish School Board (ALPSB@), seeking to desegregate its de jure dual public school \nsystem.   On July 28, 1966, this Court entered a decree permanently enjoining LPSB from \n                                                 \n1Collectively, the Court refers to these Defendants as โthe State Defendants.โ \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 2 of 17 PageID #:  10717\noperating a racially segregated school system.  On August 1, 1969, the Court entered an order \ndirecting LPSB to Atake affirmative action to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate \nthe effects of the dual school system@ and to adopt a desegregation plan.   \nNeither the Grambling Lab Schools, a public laboratory school located on the campus of \nGSU, or the A.E. Phillips Laboratory School (AAEP@), a public laboratory school located on the \ncampus of La. Tech, were parties to the original action.    \nAs a result of further litigation, in 1980, this Court added the State Defendants, GSU (as \noperator of the Grambling Lab Schools), and La. Tech (as operator of AEP).  [Doc. Nos. 82-16, \n82-17 & 82-20].  AThe state became involved in this action because the laboratory schools are run \nby the Louisiana State Board of Education and the respective university officials.@ [Doc. No. \n82-21].  AThe racial composition of these two [lab] schools became an issue in the [LPSB] case@ \nbecause of its role as a conduit for funds and materials to the lab schools, providing transportation \nto their students, and approving faculty selections.   Id. at p. 1.   \nOn July 13, 1984, the Court entered a Consent Decree, agreed upon and signed by the \nUnited States, the State of Louisiana (the AState@), GSU, La. Tech, and LPSB.  The 1984 Consent \nDecree required GSU, La. Tech, and LPSB to take a number of actions intended to desegregate \nthe laboratory schools at the two universities.  [Doc. No. 82-3, pp. 4-24]. \nFor many years, no action was taken in this case with regard to any parties.  However, \nupon its own motion on August 14, 2008, the Court amended the 1970 Decree, reactivating this \ncase and requiring LPSB to file an annual statistical report.  [Doc. No. 2].  On December 14, \n2009, this Court ordered the United States to conduct a unitary status review.  See [Doc. No. 8].  \nDuring the course of that review, the United States identified continuing issues related to the \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 3 of 17 PageID #:  10718\ndesegregation of the lab schools, which it summarized for the Court in its May 24, 2011 Status \nReport [Doc. No. 25].     \nOn May 13, 2013, the United States filed a Motion for Further Relief [Doc. No. 82] seeking \na new desegregation plan for the laboratory schools.  La. Tech and GSU opposed the United \nStates= motion, and each university cross-filed for a declaration of unitary status [Doc. Nos. 97-98, \n104-105].  LPSB filed a motion to dismiss itself from the litigation regarding the lab school issues \n[Doc. No. 102].  Following briefing on the parties= various motions, the Court directed the parties \nto engage in negotiations to attempt to resolve the lab school issues.  See [Doc. No. 118, pp. 1-2]. \nThe United States proposed options to desegregate the lab schools to GSU and the other \nDefendants on November 12, 2013.  See [Doc. No. 122].  On January 6, 2014, the United States \nmet with counsel for GSU and the other Defendants to further discuss the proposals to resolve the \noutstanding desegregation issues involving the lab schools.  See id. at p. 2.  The United States, \nGSU, and the other parties met with the Court on March 10, 2014, for further negotiations.  See \n[Doc. No. 124, pp. 2-3].  During the conference, GSU informed the Court and the parties that, in \npartnership with GSU and the City of Grambling, GHF had sought permission from LPSB to \nconvert GSU=s lab schools to a Type 3 charter school and would seek permission from BESE for \na Type 2 charter after receiving LPSB=s anticipated rejection.   See id. at p. 2.   \nGHF did not receive permission from LPSB to convert to a Type 3 charter school and \nproceeded with obtaining a Type 2 charter.  On August 12, 2015, GHF received conditional \napproval from BESE for a Type 2 charter school, pending Louisiana Department of Education \n(โLDOEโ) review.  After the State Superintendent confirmed that GHF met all standards for \napproval, GSU filed an Amended Motion and Brief [Doc. Nos. 170, 170-1] on January 27, 2016, \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 4 of 17 PageID #:  10719\nseeking the Courtโs authorization to convert the Grambling Lab Schools to a charter school and to \ntransfer control and governance of the charter school to GHF.  The United States opposed GSU=s \nAmended Motion to the extent that it sought to operate the charter school without any obligations \nto desegregate and to eliminate the vestiges of the de jure segregation.  See [Doc. No. 200]. \nOn April 20, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing regarding GSU=s Motion and Amended \nMotion [Doc. Nos. 157, 170].  See [Doc. No. 205].  On April 25, 2016, the Court issued a Ruling \nand Order granting GSU=s motion in part and denying it in part.  See [Doc. No. 211]; [Doc. No. \n212].  The Court granted GSU=s request to close the lab schools at the end of the 2015-2016 school \nyear, but denied GSU=s request to transfer control of the former Grambling Lab Schools to GHF \nwithout desegregation obligations.  The Court granted the request Aonly if GHF accepts the \ntransfer subject to GSU=s desegregation obligations and under the other conditions detailed in this \nRuling.@  [Doc. No. 211, pp. 8-9].  Those conditions included the following requirements: (i) \nGHF Awill enroll in this matter immediately@; (ii) GSU, Awhile no longer operating the Laboratory \nSchools, will remain a party to this action to facilitate the transfer and to assist the Court with any \nissues that may arise with the charter school@; and (iii) GSU and GHF Awill work with the United \nStates to develop a new consent decree to replace the 1984 Consent Decree and to develop a plan \nwhich is reasonably calculated to address the goals of desegregation and to allow the new charter \nschool to obtain unitary status.@ [Doc. No. 211, p. 8]. \nOn July 19, 2016, the Court granted GHF=s motion to intervene.   [Doc. No. 221]. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 5 of 17 PageID #:  10720\nOn August 2, 2016, the parties participated in a settlement conference.  After the parties \nreached an impasse, GHF made an oral motion for authorization to open Lincoln Prep for the \n2016-2017 school year.  See [Doc. No. 230, p. 7].  The United States opposed the oral motion.  \nSee id. at pp. 7-8.  After conducting an emergency hearing on August 2, the Court authorized GHF \nto begin operating Lincoln Prep as a K-12 charter school in the 2016-2017 school year, subject to \nseveral conditions: (i) Lincoln Prep Awill have a baseline of 370 students@; (ii) GHF Awill file a \nletter of financial commitment for the construction of new facilities no later than October 1, 2017@; \nand (iii) GHF and the United States Awill file a proposed consent decree no later than September \n6, 2016 . . . . [or] separate proposed desegregation plans for the charter school with argument in \nsupport thereof.@  Id. at p. 12.   \nOn August 15, 2016, the Court granted in part and denied in part GSU=s Motion to Dismiss \n[Doc. No. 105].  To the extent that GSU moved the Court to find the Grambling Laboratory \nSchools unitary, the motion was denied as moot. [Doc. No. 234].  To the extent that GSU moved \nfor its dismissal from this case based on its obligations to the Grambling Laboratory Schools, the \nmotion was granted in part.  However, the motion was denied to the extent that GSU sought its \ncomplete dismissal from this case. The Court ruled that GSU remain a party to facilitate the transfer \nof the Grambling Laboratory Schools to GHF, to assist with any issues that may arise with the \ncharter school, and to work toward developing a plan for the charter schools which is reasonably \ncalculated to address the goals of desegregation and to allow the school to obtain unitary status. \nOn January 18, 2017, the Court found LPSB had achieved unitary status and dismissed the \ncase against it.  However, GSU, GHF, La. Tech, and the State Defendants remained parties in this \naction.  See [Doc. Nos. 265 & 266].   \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 6 of 17 PageID #:  10721\nThere continued to be issues with the desegregation of Lincoln Prep.  During the 2016-\n2017 school year, Lincoln Prep had a white student enrollment of about 3.2%.  A hearing was \nheld in this matter on July 20, 2017, after the United States and GHF failed to reach an agreement \non certain provisions of a proposed order for the upcoming school year.  During the hearing, GHF \norally moved for modification of those conditions of operation imposed in August 2016.  The \nUnited States opposed the motion and urged the Court to adopt the proposed order in its entirety. \n    On August 1, 2017, the Court issued a Memorandum Order [Doc. No. 287] granting in part \nand denying in part GHFโs oral motion and issuing an Interim Order (โthe Interim Orderโ).  In \npart, the Interim Order provided that GHF โshall, by the 2020-2021 school year, increase the \npercentage of white students enrolled at Lincoln Prep, so that it is within plus or minus 20 \npercentage points of the percentage of white students enrolled in grades K-12 in LPSBโs schools.  \nGFH will thereafter exercise good faith efforts to maintain the percentage of white students \nenrolled in the school within that range.โ  [Doc. No. 287, pp. 11-12].  To reach the ultimate 2020-\n2021 school year target, beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the Court limited black student \nenrollment to 360 students, but allowed GHF to enroll as many white students and students of \nother races as permitted by their state charter.  Id. at p. 13.  Additionally, the Court set white \nstudent enrollment targets for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years:2 \nBeginning with the 2017-2018 school year, GHF will have a percentage enrollment \nof 8% white students. For the following school year, 2018-2019, GHF will have a \npercentage enrollment of 14% white students. GHF will take affirmative measures-\nvia an actively managed enrollment process-to reach the annual white student \nenrollment targets for each entering kindergarten class and for higher grade levels. \n \n                                                 \n2The Court did not set targets for the 2019-2020 school year, with the idea that the parties would continue \nto work together in good faith and would seek guidance and/or rulings from the Court if necessary.  See [Doc. No. \n287, p. 19].   \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 7 of 17 PageID #:  10722\nId. at p. 12.  The Court set additional requirements for staffing, composition of the Board of \nDirectors, facilities, quality of education, transportation, and extracurricular activities.  Finally, \nthe Court continued the requirement that, on or before October 15 of each year, GHF must file a \nstatus report containing the identified information.   \n  In October 2017, GHF filed its status report and exhibits.  [Doc. Nos. 302 & 303].  At \nthat time, GHF had enrolled 31 white students or 7.3% of the student population.   \n  In October 2018, GHF filed its status report and exhibits.  [Doc. Nos. 313 & 314].  At \nthat time, GHF had enrolled 34 white students or 7.8% of the student population.  On October 30, \n2018, the Court issued a minute entry [Doc. No. 316] setting a status conference for December 3, \n2018. \n  On December 3, 2018, the Court held a status conference with counsel for the United \nStates, GHF, and GSU and the Courtโs law clerk.  The Court set deadlines for information \nrequested by the United States and further reminded counsel that GHF should be continuing to \nlook for a new location for Lincoln Prep.  \n  On February 7, 2019, in light of the appropriations lapse for Government agencies, \nincluding the DOJ, the Court granted an extension to February 28, 2019, for the United States to \nfile a memorandum addressing GHFโs status report and all additional information received.  The \nCourt then extended this deadline to March 11, 2019, on the United Statesโ motion. [Doc. No. \n322]. \n  On March 11, 2019, the United States filed a memorandum on GHFโs compliance with the \nInterim Order. [Doc. Nos. 323, 324 & 325].    \n  After reviewing the Lincoln Prep report and the United Statesโ response, the Court had  \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 8 of 17 PageID #:  10723\nserious concerns about Lincoln Prepโs ongoing failure to reach complete compliance with the \nCourtโs prior desegregation orders.  Therefore, the Court set a telephone status conference. \nOn March 18, 2019, the Court held a status conference with counsel, setting a hearing for \nApril 29, 2019, to address these concerns.  The Court also set discovery and briefing deadlines.  \nOn March 21, 2019, GHF filed a Motion for Declaration of Unitary Status of Lincoln Prep \n[Doc. No. 328], contending that it has complied with all of the Green factors relevant to a finding \nof unitary status. \nOn March 22, 2019, GHF filed a Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 334], contending that the \nCourt  lacks  subject  matter  jurisdiction  because  there  is  a  lack  of  record  evidence  that  the \npredecessor laboratory schools operated by GSU were de jure segregated.  \nOn April 2, 2019, the Court granted the United Statesโ opposed Motion to Stay Proceedings \non GHFโs two motions.  [Doc. No. 340].  However, the Court stayed only the United Statesโ \nobligation to file opposition briefs.  To avoid duplicative evidentiary hearings, the Court ordered \nthat GHF and the United States would be permitted to present evidence relevant either to the \nCourtโs sua sponte inquiry or to the motions.       \n  After a tornado caused significant damage to the office and home of GHFโs counsel, on \nApril 25, 2019, the Court held a status conference with counsel and re-set the hearing for May 14, \n2019.  [Doc. No. 343].  Trial briefs were timely filed before the hearing.  [Doc. Nos. 348, 349 \n& 352]. \n  An evidentiary hearing was held on May 14-15, 2019.  The Court heard testimony, via \nlive and video presentations, from GHFโs expert, Dr. Joanne Hood; Lincoln Prepโs director, Lt. \nCol. Gordon Ford; Lincoln Prep Senior Assistant Director, Melanie Colvin, and Assistant Director \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 9 of 17 PageID #:  10724\nPhadra Burks Blake; Dr. Birdex Copeland; and the United Statesโ experts, Dr. Claire Smrekar and \nJames Brewer.   \nOn June 14, 2019, the Court issued a Ruling, finding that GHF is not in compliance with \nthe orders of this Court, but allowing GHF to continue operation of Lincoln Prep for the 2019-\n2020 school year, given its good faith efforts.  The Court cautioned, however, that authorization \nfor the 2020-2021 school year was subject to review without further hearing.   The Court denied \nthe United Statesโ Motion for Judgment of a Matter of Law [Doc. No. 353], subject to re-urging at \na later date.  The Court also deferred consideration of GHFโs pending motions [Doc. Nos. 328 & \n334], subject to consideration after October 15, 2019, or earlier if circumstances change.    \nOn October 25, 2019, GHF filed its annual status report and exhibits with the Court.  [Doc. \nNos. 369, 370 & 371].  Since that time, counsel for the Department of Justice (โDOJโ) has \nconducted a site visit with its experts, and the parties have engaged in some additional exchange \nof information. \nOn November 8, 2019, the Court held a status conference with counsel.  Participating were \nJonathan Newton, attorney with the DOJ; Tyler Storms, attorney for GHF; Patricia Wilton, \nattorney with the BESE and Board of Regents; Ashley Butler, attorney with the LDOE; Winston \nDeCuir, counsel for GSU.  Also present was Law Clerk, Kayla Dye McClusky.  During that \nconference, the Court indicated its intent to issue an order prohibiting Lincoln Prep from operating \non the campus of GSU after this school year. Counsel raised some logistical issues with relocation \nand temporary use of some services or facilities at GSU.  The Court ordered GHF to file, no later \nthan December 2, 2019, a response to the Courtโs intended action, particularly addressing whether \nthe logistical issues have been resolved or whether there are remaining issues or concerns for the \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 10 of 17 PageID #:  10725\nCourt to address in its order.  The DOJ, and any other party which wished to do so, was ordered \nto reply to GHFโs response no later than December 16, 2019.   \nAttorneys for the State agencies and departments indicated that they were present to \nmonitor the proceedings and to address any issues related to the charter authorization to GHF.  \nThey did not anticipate filing a memorandum in reply to GHFโs response. \nOn November 27, 2019, GHF filed an early response to the Courtโs intended action.  [Doc. \nNo. 373].   \nOn December 16, 2019, the DOJ filed a response to the Courtโs intended action.  [Doc. \nNo. 375].   \nHaving reviewed the responses of GHF and the DOJ and having received no other \nresponses, the Court is prepared to enter an order in this matter.   \nII.   LAW AND ANALYSIS  \n \nWhen first presented with a school desegregation case, a district court is charged with \ndetermining whether or not a school board (or governing authority) has maintained or facilitated a \ndual school system in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.  \nU.S. CONST., Amend. XIV.  If the district court finds such a violation, then under Brown v. Bd. of \nEduc. of Topeka, Shawnee Cnty., Kan., 347 U.S. 483 (1954), and Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349 U.S. \n294 (1955), the dual system must be dismantled, and the school board must Atake whatever steps \nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be \neliminated root and branch.@  Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent Cty., Va., 391 U.S. 430, 437-\n38 (1968). \nNeither the local governing authorityโs nor a district court=s duty ends with the initial \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 11 of 17 PageID #:  10726\ndesegregation order.  Rather, there is a Acontinuing duty [for school officials] to eliminate the \nsystem-wide effects of earlier discrimination and to create a unitary school system untainted by \nthe past.@  Ross v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 699 F.2d 218, 225 (5th Cir. 1983) (citing Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg  Bd.  of  Educ.,  402  U.S.  1,  15  (1971)).    Likewise,  the  district  court \nAretain[s] jurisdiction until it is clear that state-imposed segregation has been completely removed.@  \nId. (citing Green, 391 U.S. at 439; Raney v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 443, 449 (1968)); see also Price \nv. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 945 F.2d 1307, 1314 (5th Cir. 1991) (We use the term Aunitary@ to refer \nto a school district that Ahas done all that it could to remedy the [prior] segregation caused by \nofficial action.@) . \nThe goal of the district court is to return Aschools to the control of local authorities at the \nearliest practicable date.@ Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 490 (1992).  In discharging this duty, \nthe  district  court  considers  the  Supreme  Court=s  AGreen  factors@:    (1)  faculty  and  staff \nassignments;  (2)  transportation;  (3)  extra-curricular  activities;  (4)  facilities;  and  (5)  student \nassignments.  Green, 391 U.S. at 435; see also Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, \n498 U.S. 237, 250 (1991).    \nAThe District Court should address itself to whether the Board had complied in good faith \nwith the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination \nhad been eliminated to the extent practicable.@  Dowell, 498 at  249-50; Freeman, 503 U.S. at \n491; Green, 391 U.S. at 439; Ross, 699 F.2d at 225. \nA.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \nThis case is unusual because it involved not only the local school board, but two state-\ncreated laboratory schools, AEP and the former Grambling Lab Schools, and the State educational \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 12 of 17 PageID #:  10727\nentities.  The Court has determined that LPSB has met its desegregation obligations, achieved \nunitary status, and dismissed it from the case.  The Court has further approved a consent order \napplicable to La. Tech and AEP, which provides that La. Tech may file a motion for dismissal \nwithin ninety (90) days of the submission of it October 15, 2021 report, assuming that it remains \nin compliance with the consent order.  Doc. No. 254].  However, GSU, GHF, and the State \nDefendants3 remain active participants.   \nFirst, as it must, the Court addresses GHFโs Motion to Dismiss and its contention that \nsubject matter jurisdiction is lacking.  There is no factual dispute that LPSB formerly operated a \nde jure dual public school system, that a decree permanently enjoining LPSB from operating a \nracially segregated school system was first entered in 1966, that LPSB was ordered to dismantle \nits dual system and to eliminate all effects of that system in 1969, and that LPSB remained subject \nto those orders and their amendments until its dismissal in January 2017. \nIn 1980, the United States, with leave of Court, amended its Complaint in this action to add \nparty Defendants on the basis that AEP โhad been designated and was identifiable as a White \nSchool,โ while the Grambling Lab Schools,4 located within three miles of AEP, were โdesignated \nand . . .identifiable as Black School[s].โ5  [Doc. No. 82-3, 1984 Consent Decree].  There is no \nfactual dispute that GSU, La. Tech, and the State Defendants were made part of the LPSB case in \n1980 because the schools were physically located in Lincoln Parish; the schools were admittedly \n                                                 \n3The State Defendants remain in the litigation because of AEP and Lincoln Prep.   \n \n4The elementary school was formerly known as Alma J. Brown, but the Court refers to \nthe Grambling Laboratory Schools for consistency. \n \n5Although GHF presented evidence through the testimony of Mindy Lewis that there was \none white family whose children attended Grambling Laboratory Schools early in their history, it \nis clear that the Grambling Laboratory Schools were racially identifiable as black.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 13 of 17 PageID #:  10728\ndesignated and identifiable by race; and LPSB served as a conduit for funds and materials to those \nschools, provided transportation to their students, and approved faculty selections.  The United \nStates, the State, GSU, La. Tech, and LPSB all negotiated over the next four years โto arrive at a \nmutually agreeable plan which realistically promise[d] to desegregateโ the two schools.  [Doc. \nNo. 82-3, p. 4].  The 1984 Consent Decree set forth the actions to do just that. \nUnder these circumstances, the Court finds that it has subject-matter jurisdiction over the \ndesegregation of the Grambling Laboratory Schools and their successor, GHF, pursuant to the \nCourtโs previous rulings and the agreement of the parties as to the facts.  Thus, GHFโs Motion to \nDismiss must be denied. \nB.   Unitary Status \nUnfortunately, over the ensuing years, all steps practicable and those specific steps set forth \nin the 1984 Consent Decree were not taken to desegregate the laboratory schools, resulting in this \nCourtโs continued oversight.   \nIn its motion filed with the Court prior to the evidentiary hearing, GHF argues that it is in \ncompliance with the Green factors, should be found unitary, and the case against it should be \ndismissed.  The Court disagrees. \nAs previously indicated, no additional evidentiary hearing is necessary to address its sua \nsponte considerations or GHFโs motions because much of the evidence and testimony presented \nat the latest hearing was already known to the Court, and there has been no indication from any \nremaining party that another hearing would result in a change in that evidence.   \nThe Court further finds that additional briefing is not necessary.  The parties filed trial \nbriefs at the time of the previous hearings and have, on numerous occasions, both at hearings and \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 14 of 17 PageID #:  10729\nduring conferences, had the opportunity to provide more information and argue their positions to \nthe Court.   \nAt no time since GSU transferred the schools to GHFโs operation has Lincoln Prep been \nin compliance with the white student enrollment as required by the Interim Order.  GHF is not \nin compliance now.  The Court further finds that the Lincoln Prep facilities are a barrier to \ndesegregation.  This is so for two reasons:  the facilities are in the same poor condition at the \nformer Grambling Lab Schools as they were while being operated by GSU6 and the location of \nLincoln Prep on the campus of a historically black university makes recruitment of white \nstudents more difficult.  Finally, the Court has previously found that, despite gains in academic \nachievement, Lincoln Prep remains a low-performing school, which is also a barrier to \ndesegregation. \nThe facts adduced at the evidentiary hearing and provided to the Court in status \nconferences, reports, and briefs do not entitle GHF to a finding of unitary status, and its Motion \nfor Declaration of Unitary Status of Lincoln Prep [Doc. No. 328] must be denied. \nHowever, the Courtโs involvement cannot end here.  Rather, the Court has carefully \nconsidered its role with regard to desegregation while remaining cognizant of its duty to avoid \ninterference with the lawful operation of a state charter school, as long as such school does not \npromote re-segregation or prevent the dismantling of the former de jure system.  To achieve that \nbalance, the Court addresses the actions necessary to resolve this case.   \n \n                                                 \n6 The Court does not ignore GHFโs efforts to improve the facilities, but the fact remains \nthat those facilities cannot be characterized as satisfactory at this point. \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 376   Filed 01/08/20   Page 15 of 17 PageID #:  10730\nIII.   COURT ACTION \n  In light of the Courtโs findings, the Court will no longer authorize GHF to operate \nLincoln Prep on the campus of GSU.  It is the Courtโs understanding that neither the DOJ, the \nBESE, the LDOE, the Board of Regents, or GHF has an objection to the operation of Lincoln \nPrep, as a charter school authorized by the State, in another location.  Specifically, GHF has \nindicated that it intends to relocate either to (1) a split usage campus that entails classrooms at \nNew Living Wordโs school and a remodeled Fredโs building on Highway 80 or (2) to a \npurchased new site, where it will begin construction as soon as possible.    \n  The parties have raised concerns about use of GSU facilities and services on a temporary, \ntransitional basis.  After reviewing those concerns, the Court approves the use of GSU \ncafeteria/food services for the preparation of food to be served at the new location of Lincoln \nPrep.  However, the Court denies GHF authorization for the continued use of GSU athletic \nfacilities for basketball, and track and field events.

Expressions in our earlier opinions distinguishing between integration and desegregation must yield to this \naffirmative duty we now recognize. In fulfilling this duty it is not enough for school authorities to offer Negro children the \nopportunity to attend formerly all-white schools. The necessity of overcoming the effects of the dual school system in this circuit \nrequires integration of faculties, facilities, and activities, as well as students. To the extent that earlier decisions of this Court \n(more in the language of the opinions, than in the effect of the holdings) conflict with this view, the decisions are overruled.โ \nJefferson II, 380 F.2d at 389. \n \n4  โThe method has serious shortcomings. Indeed, the โslow pace of integration in the Southern and border States is in large \nmeasure attributable to the manner in which free choice plans * * * have operatedโ. When such plans leave school officials with \n \na broad area of uncontrolled discretion, this method of desegregation is better suited than any other to preserve the essentials of \nthe dual school system while giving paper compliance with the duty to desegregate.โ Jefferson I, 372 F.2d at 888. \n \n5  โFreedom of choice is not a goal in itself. It is a means to an end. A schoolchild has no inalienable right to choose his school. A \nfreedom of choice plan is but one of the tools available to school officials at this stage of the process of converting the dual \n \nsystem of separate schools for Negroes and whites into a unitary system. The governmental objective of this conversion isโ \neducational opportunities on equal terms to all. The criterion for determining the validity of a provision in a school desegregation \nplan is whether the provision is reasonably related to accomplishing this objective.โ Jefferson II, 380 F.2d at 390. \n \n6  Jefferson I, 372 F.2d at 847. โIf the (freedom of choice) plan is ineffective, longer on promises than performance, the school \nofficials charged with initiating and administering a unitary system have not met the constitutional requirements of the \n \nFourteenth Amendment; they should try other tools.โ Jefferson II, 380 F.2d at 390. \n \n7  See also, decided the same day, May 27, 1968, Monroe v.

The new elementary school will be 60% \n \nWhite and 40% Black, and the junior high will be 55% White and 45% Black. \n \n12  Part IV provides that \n(a)ll school construction, school consolidation, and site selection (including the location of any temporary classrooms) in the \n \nsystem shall be done in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school structure once this desegregation plan is \nimplemented. \n \n5 \n \n\n \n \nCopeland v. Lincoln Parish School Bd., 598 F.2d 977 (1979)   \n \n \n13  More specifically, they sought declaratory relief and orders: \n(1) Requiring defendants to further desegregate the public school system in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana; \n \n(2) Restraining and enjoining any further expenditure of public funds on any new school construction sites or renovation of \nexisting educational facilities; \n(3) Requiring defendants to conduct a public hearing and give priority consideration to the establishment of a new school \nconstruction site within Ward II of Lincoln Parish, Louisiana. \nSee R. at 625. \n \n14  This trial was held on September 20, 1977. \n \n \n15  As the District Court found, โplacing a school in Ward II would surround it with a population that is over 90 percent blackโ and \nwould โitself . . . violate . . . the consent decree.โ R. at 731. The Court further stated that \n \n(t)he only way to bring white children to Ward II would be by massive busing. When a simpler alternative, integrated \nneighborhood schools, is available, such massive busing is unwarranted. \nId. See United States v. Hendry County School District, supra at 554 (โWe must also insure that the burdens of desegregation are \ndistributed equally * * * the overall transportation burden will be distributed with equal effect upon each race.โ) \n \n16  See discussion, Infra. \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n6 \n ",

Whether the court erred in denying the United States'\nmotion based on factual findings contrary to allegations contained\ntherein, when the court's action was taken without holding an\nevidentiary hearing.(cid:9) /\n2. Whether the court erred in holding that the United\nStates' motion for modification of an existing desegregation\norder must be filed as a new complaint.\nORAL ARGUMENT\nThe issues presented by this appeal are not complex. In\naddition, due to the fact that the order herein appealed was\nentered without a hearing, there is little factual record for\nreview. Accordingly, the United States suggests that oral argu-\nment is not necessary for this Court to properly consider this\nappeal.\n\n-2-\nSTATEMENT\n1. Procedural History\nThe original complaint in United States v. Lincoln \nParish School Board was filed on June 8, 1966. R. 1. It sought\nthe desegregation of the public school system in Lincoln Parish.\nWhen freedom of choice desegregation proved ineffective, the\nUnited States moved for a new plan, which was adopted August 1,\n1969, and sought to desegregate the school system through the\nuse of attendance zones and feeder patterns. R. 8. That\nplan was modified for the 1970-71 school year on August 7, 1970.\nR. 17.\nOn November 9, 1976, a group of black parents\nfiled a suit styled Birdex Copeland v. Lincoln Parish School \nBoard, No. 76-1197. The children of the adult plaintiffs in\nCopeland, all of whom reside in the city of Grambling, attend\nan all-black \"laboratory school\" on the campus of Grambling\n/\n1\nUniversity. See record in Copeland appeal, Vol. II, p. 1, 5.\n1/ The record on appeal in the Copeland case is contained\nin volumes II, III, IV, and Exhibits of the record filed under\nNo. 77-3375. For purposes of this brief the Record on Appeal\nrelating to United States v. Lincoln Parish School Board will\nbe referred to as \"R.\" The Record on Appeal in Copeland v.\nLincoln Parish School Board will be referred to as \"Copeland R.\"\n\n- 3 -\nCopeland plaintiffs alleged that the failure of the Lincoln\nParish School Board to construct a school in their community,\ncoupled with the continued existence of the all-black \"laboratory\nschool\" was discriminatory and violated the existing desegregation\norder in United States v. Lincoln Parish School Board by prolonging\nthe process of desegregation. Copeland R., Vol. II, p. 5-7.\nOn January 10, 1977, the United States filed a motion\nto consolidate the Copeland case with United States v. Lincoln \nParish School Board, R. 61, which motion was granted on\nJanuary 31, 1977. R. 58. Also on that date the United States\nwas appointed amicus curiae with full rights of a party in the\nCopeland case. R. 74.\nOn July 22, 1977, the United States filed a motion to\nadd parties defendant and to modify the existing desegregation\nplan. The motion was filed in both the original suit, No. 12071,\nand in the Copeland suit. That motion sought to add to the\noriginal desegregation case the public officials responsible,\nwith the school board, for operation of the laboratory schools\non the campuses of Grambling State University and Louisiana\nTech University. R. 90.\nThe motion requested the court to modify the injunction\nentered in the original desegregation suit so to require the\ndesegregation of the laboratory schools and to enable the school\n\n!.โ\n- 4 -\nboard to complete the desegregation of public education in\nthe parish. On August 4, 1977, the school board filed its\nresponse, R. 106, which suggested that the school board\ncould provide no relief in the issues presented regarding the\nlaboratory schools, R. 108, and recommended that the United\nStates be required to file a new complaint against the parties\nthe United States sought to add to the desegregation suit.\nR. 107.\nOn November 1, 1977, the district court denied the\n2/\nUnited States' motion. R. 121.\n2. Facts \nThe Motion filed by the United States alleged that there\nare two laboratory schools located within the boundaries of\nLincoln Parish. R. 94. The Alma Brown laboratory school, it\nwas alleged, is located on the campus of Grambling University\nand is attended almost solely by black students. R. 94. The\nmotion stated that the other laboratory school, A.E. Phillips, is\n2/ The court's entry was erroneously styled Copeland v. Lincoln\nParish School Board, No. 76-1197, instead of being properly stied\nUnited States v. Lincoln Parish School Board, No. 12071. However,\nthe language of the entry unequivocally states \"The United States\nhas moved to add additional parties defendant to the action. The\nmotion is DENIED.\" The order also said that the United States\nshould seek its relief \"in a separate suit rather than in the\npending ones.\" R. 121. This language shows that although the\nminute entry was apparently mis-styled, the entry denied the\nrelief sought by the United States in its Motion filed July 23,\n1977.\nOn November 30, 1977, the court issued an opinion and judg-\nment in the Copeland case, finding for the school board. Copeland\nR. Vol. IV, p. 724. That judgment was appealed by the plaintiffs.\n\n- 5 -\nlocated on the campus of Louisiana Tech University and is\nattended almost solely by white students. Id. The motion\nalleged that the schools were initially established, and\noperated, as part of the dual system of public schools, and\nhave never been desegregated.\nThe motion stated that authority over the laboratory\nschools is shared by the local school board and the Louisiana\nState Department of Education. R. 94. The local board, the\nmotion alleged (R. 95):\n(i) employs the principal and teachers\nat the laboratory schools with funds\nallocated by the State for that\npurpose, (ii) contributes the same\namount from local taxes to the salaries\nof faculty employed at the laboratory\nschool as it does to other teachers\nemployed by the parish, (iii) furnishes\ninstructional supplies and materials to\nthe laboratory schools on the same\nbasis as it does to other schools, and\n(iv) is responsible for the transportation\nof students to and from the laboratory\nschools.\nThe motion stated that supervision of the operation of\nthe laboratory schools rests with the President of the college\nat which each is located, R. 96; in this regard, the United States\nsought to add to this action these two college presidents. The\nmotion also sought to add as defendants members of the State\nBoard of Elementary and Secondary Education, and the State Superin-\n\n- 6 -\ntendent of Education, who, the motion alleged, have overall\nresponsibility over the public education within the state.\nR. 95.\nThe response filed by the Lincoln Parish School Board\ndid not specifically deny any of the factual allegations made\nin the United States' Motion. That response, however, did state\nthat the board is \"not a party who can provide the relief sought\non the issues regarding the laboratory schools.\" R. 108.\nThe original decree in this desegregation action, entered\non July 29, 1966, prohibited the board from taking any action\nin support of racially segregated schools. That order did\nnot list schools affected by the order. The desegregation\nplan entered by the court on August 1, 1969, adopted the desegre-\ngation plan submitted by the school board. R. 8. This plan,\nas subsequently modified in minor respects, is the plan which\nthe school board is presently implementing. The plan did not\nrefer to either of the laboratory schools, so consequently,\nunlike the rest of the public schools in the district, neither\nschool, at present, is operating under specific boundaries set\nout in the decree.\n\n- 7 -\n3. Opinion of the District Court \nThe district court's order denying the motion filed by\nthe United States is here set out in its entirety (R. 121):\nThis action was filed seeking enforcement\nof and further relief in the decree issued\nin Civil Action No. 12071, United States v.\nLincoln Parish School Board. The United\nStates has moved to add additional parties\ndefendant to the action. The motion is\nDENIED.\nThe reason for the additional parties is\nto litigate issues of discrimination and\nsegregation in the laboratory schools at\nGrambling State University and Louisiana\nTech University. These issues are not\nadjuncts to the issues of discrimination\nand desegregation in schools under the\njurisdiction of the Lincoln Parish School\nBoard. Actions No. 76-1197 and No. 12071\nwere concerned only with schools under the\njurisdiction of the School Board. Thus,\nthe interests of justice and clarity require\nthat the United States seek its relief in a\nseparate suit rather than in the pending\nones.\n\n8\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe court's decree of August 7, 1970 retained continuing\njurisdiction of the school desegregation case \"for the pur-\npose of enforcing or modifying\" the order. R. 33. The\nUnited States' motion sought to modify that order, so as to\nrequire the desegregation of the laboratory schools located\non the campuses of Grambling and Louisiana Tech. The district\ncourt's order that the modification sought must be the subject\nof a new lawsuit was erroneous.\nTo the extent that the district court relied on a find-\ning, implicit in its order, that the Lincoln Parish School\nBoard plays no part in the operation of the laboratory schools,\nthat finding is unsupported by the record. Such a finding is\ncontrary to allegations in the United States' motion, which\nalleged substantial specific involvement of the local school\nboard in the operation of the laboratory schools. Such a\nfactual finding could properly be made only after the receipt\nof evidence refuting those allegations, and the absence of\na hearing renders the court's finding erroneous.\nThe racial enrollment figures for the laboratory schools\ndemonstrate that the schools remain as vestiges of the dual\nsystem of public education. For that reason, the United States\nhas attempted to secure the desegregation of those schools.\n\n- 9 -\nThe record indicates that the laboratory schools were\ninitially brought under the jurisdiction of the original\ndesegregation suit, but were not included in orders which\nenacted specific desegregation plans. To this extent, this\ncase is the proper one in which to resolve the issue of the\ncontinuing segregation at those schools; the district court's\nrequirement of new litigation is unwarranted.\nEven if the laboratory schools were never previously part\nof this action, any effective desegregation of those schools\nwill most likely require modifications of the desegregation\nplan presently in effect. For this reason, the desegregation\nof those schools must be litigated as part of this suit, rather\nthan in a new suit. The district court's order in this case\nwould likely result in duplicative litigation, as any remedy\ndirected to the laboratory schools in a new suit would then\nrequire action in the original desegregation suit to accom-\nmodate the effects of such relief in the pre-existing desegre-\ngation order. Principles established by this Court direct\ndistrict courts to avoid duplicative litigation in issues\naffecting school desegregation, by requiring issues concerning\nthe final achievement of a unitary system to be litigated as\npart of the original desegregation case.\n\n- 10 -\nARGUMENT\nI. THE COURT'S FINDING THAT THE LINCOLN PARISH SCHOOL\nBOARD EXERCISES NO JURISDICTION OVER THE LABORATORY\nSCHOOLS IS UNSUPPORTED.\nThe district court stated that the reason it chose\nto deny the United States' motion to address the segregation\nin the laboratory schools as part of the existing desegre-\ngation case was that these schools are not under the school\nboard's jurisdiction. R. 121. This finding not only is\ncontrary to the unrefuted allegations contained in the\nmotion filed by the United States, but also contrary to\nevidence developed during the discovery held prior to the\nentry of the court's order.\nThe United States' motion alleged that the Lincoln\nParish School Board played a substantial role in the operation\nof the laboratory schools, by employing the staffs at those\nschools, by contributing to the salaries of those teachers\ntax revenues in an amount equal to that added to the salaries\nof other teachers in the parish, by supplying instructional\nmaterial to these schools as it does with other schools in\nthe parish, and by providing transportation for students\nattending the laboratory schools. R. 95.\nThe response of the school board does not deny any\nof these assertions; nor does it refer to any evidence in\nthe record. Accordingly, the court's order denying the\nmotion appears to have been handled as a judgment on the\npleadings. In such cases, facts alleged by the party\n\nopposing the judgment must, for purposes of review, be taken\nas true. Southeast Mortgage C (cid:9) v. Mullins, 514 F.2d 747\n(5th Cir. 1975). Accordingly, if we assume all the allega-\ntions of the United States concerning the participation of\nthe local school board in the operation of the laboratory\nschools are true, many aspects, both operational (materials,\ntransportation) and financial (local tax revenue to teachers)\nare controlled by the local school board. Such assistance\nobviously involves the local school officials in the operation\nof the laboratory schools.\nHowever, at the time the court entered its order, there\nwere several depositions on file which dealt, in part, with\nthe issue of the school board's actions concerning the operation\nof the laboratory schools. A trial court may, in its discretion,\nconsider matters of record when determining a motion for judge-\nment on the pleadings, which is then treated as a motion for\nsummary judgment. Fowler v. Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph\nCo., 343 F.2d 150 (5th Cir. 1965); Georgia Southern & F. Ry. \nCo. v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 373 F.2d 493 (5th Cir. 1967),\ncert. den., 389 U.S. 851 (1967); F.R. Civ. P., Rule 12(b).\nThe depositions on file fully support the allegations\n3/\nin the United States' motion.(cid:9) Superintendant Judd acknowledged\n3/ The depositions of Thomas Judd, Superintendent of the Lincoln\nParish Schools, and Morelle Emmons, former Superintendent, were\nfiled with the court on July 8, 1977. These were taken in con-\njunction with discovery in the Copeland case. However, an\nattorney for the United States examined the deponents on the\noperation of the laboratory schools. The original copies of the\ndepositions appear at Copeland R. Vol. III, p. 294 (Judd) and\np. 389 (Emmons).\n\n- 12 -\nthat the Lincoln Parish School Board provides materials\n(dep. at 39), pays a certain increment from local revenues\nto teachers at the laboratory schools (dep. 40), and may\nprovide money for trips for children at the laboratory\nschools (dep. 39). Former Superintendent Emmons also\nsupported the allegation that the board provided transpor-\ntation to the laboratory schools, as well as lunches (dep. 5,\n23), approved the list of teachers for the laboratory schools\n4/\n(dep. 24), and provided text books and library books (dep. 25).\nAccordingly, both the pleadings, and the discovery on file to\ndate, contradict the court's finding that the Lincoln Parish\nSchool Board has no jurisdiction over the operation of the\nlaboratory schools. To the extent that the court relied on\nthat finding in dismissing the United States' motion, such\nreliance is erroneous. At the very least, the extent of the\nevidence favoring the allegations made by the United States\nrequired a full evidentiary hearing be held, and evidence\nto the contrary be received, before a court could properly\nenter findings contrary to the allegations in the United States'\nmotion. The entry of such findings, without evidentiary\nsupport, is reversible error. See Jackson Tool & Die, Inc. v.\nSmith, 339 F.2d 99 (5th Cir. 1964); United States v. Burket,\n402 F.2d 426, 429 (5th Cir. 1968).\n4/ Both Superintendent Judd and former Superintendent Emmons\ntestified at the hearing on the Copeland motion. The transcript\nof that hearing is not yet available. To the extent that their\ntestimony may further explain the basis of the court's order on\nthe United States' motion, the United States may, when the\ntranscript becomes available, address that issue in a supplemental\nbrief.\n\n- 13 -\nII. THE RESOLUTION OF THE DESEGREGATION OF THE\nLABORATORY SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED AS\nPART OF THE EXISTING SCHOOL DESEGREGATION ACTION\nThe district court held that the relief sought by the\nUnited States must be sought \"in a separate suit.\" R. 121.\nTo the contrary, the relief sought by the United States\nshould properly be addressed only in the context of the\nexisting suit.\nThe motion filed by the United States seeks to com-\nplete the process of effectively desegregating the public\nschools in the district. As the list of attendance figures\nin the motion shows, the schools operating totally under\nthe jurisdiction of the Lincoln Parish School Board appear\nwell desegregated. R. 93. However, as the statistics appear-\ning at R. 94 demonstrate, the two laboratory schools are segre-\ngated by race. During 1975-76, the laboratory schools had the\nfollowing(cid:9) enrollments(cid:9) (R.(cid:9) 94):\nAlma Brown Elementary 31 175\nAlma Brown High 363 3\nTotal 724 13\nA.(cid:9) E.(cid:9) Phillips 244\nAlthough the desegregation of the laboratory schools has\nbeen on the periphery of United States v. Lincoln Parish School\n\n- 14 -\n5/\nBoard, it has never been squarely addressed.(cid:9) However, the\nrecord indicates that the laboratory schools have been in\nexistence since the dual system was in effect, and that\nthey now operate under a \"freedom of choice\" policy whereby\nany student in the school district may choose to attend\neither laboratory school. R. 94.\nThe statistics on enrollments demonstrate that the \"freedom\nof choice\" assignment system for the laboratory schools has\nnot effectively desegregated those schools, and that they\nremain as vestiges of the dual system which must be eliminated.\n5/ The original complaint filed by the United States on\nJune 8, 1966 in this action states that Lincoln Parish operates\nten white schools and nine black schools, R. 2, which was\nadmitted by the defendants. Suppl. R. 1. Although neither\nof these pleadings specifically states which schools were in\nexistence at that time, the United States' Motion for Supple-\nmental Relief filed on July 15, 1968, states that for the 1968-\n69 year, the school board is operating ten schools \"traditionally\nmaintained for white students and nine schools traditionally\nmaintained for Negro students,\" and lists A. E. Phillips,\n\"Grambling Elementary,\" and \"Grambling High\". Suppl. R. 5.\nThis motion culminated in the revision of the desegregation\nplan from \"freedom of choice\" to the zoning and pairing approach\nwhich essentially is still in force. The court adopted the plan\nproposed by the school board, which did not refer to the\nlaboratory schools, and rejected the plan prepared by the\nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare, which referred to\nthe laboratory school at Grambling (Alma Brown) but not the\nschool at Louisiana Tech (Phillips). See Suppl. R. 14, 18. The\ncourt's order adopting the plan submitted by the school board\ndid not refer to the laboratory schools. R. 8.\nFormer Superintendent Emmons, in deposition, suggested that\nthe freedom of choice assignment plan which is now in use at\nthe laboratory schools originated as part of the court order\nwhich established freedom of choice for all public schools in\nthe district. (Dep. 27).\n\n- 15 -\nAccordingly, the United States' motion, seeking to secure\na modification of the present plan so to effectively\ndesegregate public schools which the existing plan does\nnot desegregate, is consistent with procedures followed\nin cases previously decided by this Court. See Ellis v.\nBoard of Public Instruction of Orange County, Florida, 465\nF.2d 878 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. den. 410 U.S. 966 (1973),\nUnited States v. Seminole County, 553 F.2d 992 (5th Cir. 1977).\nThe failure of a \"freedom of choice\" plan to desegregate\nformerly de Sure schools is grounds for modification. See\nGreen v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430 (1968); Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971).\nThe jurisdiction which the district court retains, R. 32-33,\npermits the district court to entertain actions to modify its\ninjunctive decrees to provide for effective desegregation.\nEven if the laboratory school were not specifically\nsubject to the previous court decrees entered in this case,\nthe desegregation of the laboratory schools which the United\nStates seeks to secure will most likely affect the specific\ndesegregation plan under which the Lincoln Parish schools\npresently operate. In addition, the continued existence of\nthe segregated nature of those schools will continue to\nimpede the complete desegregation of the district until\nthe laboratory schools are desegregated.(cid:9) Accordingly,\n\n- 16 -\nbecause the desegregation of the laboratory schools would\nrequire a modification of the existing court order, prin-\nciples established by this Court require that such desegre-\ngation be litigated as part of the existing suit.\nAs alleged in the United States' motion, the laboratory\nschools enrolled a total of 981 students, 724 black and 257\nwhite. R. 94. The total enrollment at the public schools\noperated totally by the Lincoln Parish school board was 4742,\nwith 1988 black students (42% of the total) and 2740 white\nstudents (58% of the total). R. 93. Accordingly, if the\ndesegregation plan were modified so as to account for the\nstudents in the laboratory schools, the total number of\nstudents which the plan would cover would increase by\napproximately 20%.\nAlthough, due to the fact that there has been no hearing\non our motion, the record is not yet clear on this point, it\nappears that the school board relies on the laboratory school\nat Grambling to educate the approximately 280 children living\nin that area; there is no other public school located there.\nSee dep. of Emmons at 12, 20, dep. of Judd at 11, 37, 41.\nIn addition, although the Alma Brown school has grades K-12,\nthe A. E. Phillips school has only grades K-8. In the event\nthat desegregation of the laboratory schools is ordered, it\n\n- 17 -\nis likely that adjustments would have to be made in the\ndesegregation plan to achieve an integrated education for\n6/\nmany of the students who now attend the Grambling schools.\nThis discussion demonstrates that modifications in\nthe existing plan are necessary before a unitary system of\npublic education is secured. In instances where questions\nare raised concerning the ability of a court order to\nachieve a unitary system, this Court has adopted procedural\nrules designed to eliminate \"undue confusion and a multiplicity\nof lawsuits.\" Hines v. Rap ides Parish School Board, 479 F. 2d\n762, 765 (5th Cir. 1973).(cid:9) In Hines, this Court held that when\npersons who were not parties to the original lawsuit seek to allege\nthat the existing court order does not achieve a unitary system,\nsuch issues must be litigated as part of the existing lawsuit.\nSuch intervention, this Court reasoned, was permissible because\nthe court originally entering the desegregation order in that\ncase had retained jurisdiction over \"any ... matters pertaining\nand incidental to the preservation of a unitary public school\n6/ It is unclear at this point precisely how the court\nwould achieve desegregation for the students located in\nGrambling. We merely suggest that it may be difficult to\nachieve such desegregation within the existing laboratory\nschools, and that the plan must be modified to direct\nthe school board to account for those students in their\nplans.\n\n- 18 -\nsystem.\" 479 F.2d at 765. This retained jurisdiction covered\nthe allegations of the prospective intervenors that the existing\ncourt order had failed to achieve a unitary system. Id. See\nalso Augustus v. School Board of Escambia County, Florida,\n507 F.2d 152 (5th Cir. 1975); Davis v. Board of School Com'rs \nof Mobile County, 517 F.2d 1044 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. den.,\n425 U.S. 944 (1976).\nIn this case, the United States, although not filing as\nan intervenor, is in fact alleging that the existence and con-\ndition of the laboratory schools prevents the achievement of a\nunitary system. Such a motion, based on this Court's decision\nin Hines v. Rapides Parish and similarly decided cases, should\nhave been decided by the district court in a manner designed\nto eliminate, rather than create, new actions independent\nof, but related to, the existing desegregation case. Just\nas in Hines v. Rapides Parish, the court here retained jurisdic-\ntion \"for the purpose of modifying this order,\" jurisdiction\nwhich the United States cited in its motion. R. 92. See also\nR. 104.\nAlthough this Court has not been presented with desegre-\ngation of laboratory schools as part of a pre-existing\ndesegregation case, the United States has successfully liti-\ngated as adjuncts to ongoing school desegregation cases some-\nwhat analogous circumstances concerning the existence of public\n\n- 19 -\naid to segregated private academies, and the effects of\nthese academies on the process of desegregation. For\nexample, in United States v. State of Mississippi \n(Smith County School District), 476 F.2d 941 (5th Cir.\n1973), modified, 499 F.2d 425 (5th Cir. 1974) (en banc),\nthe United States moved for supplemental relief in an\nongoing school desegregation case to challenge a lease\narrangement between the local school board and a segre-\ngated private academy. The district court had retained\njurisdiction over the desegregation action, and addressed\nthe issue of assistance to the segregated academy as a\npossible impediment to the achievement of the unitary\nsystem, the aim of the original desegregation order. See\n476 F.2d at 942, 499 F.2d at 429. See also United States \nv. State of Georgia (Baker County School District), 466\nF.2d 487 (5th Cir. 1972).\nThis case should have been permitted to proceed in a\nsimilar manner. As in State of Mississippi, the United\nStates alleged both that the existence of the laboratory\nschools was impeding the final achievement of a unitary\nsystem, R. 96, and that the school district was contribut-\ning to the operation of the segregated schools. The recita-\ntion by this Court of the procedures used in the private\n\n- 20 -\nschool cases suggests that these same procedures are\nappropriate in this case as well, requiring the district\ncourt to address the issue of the laboratory schools as\npart of the ongoing desegregation case.\nThe United States' attempts to add to the original\nschool desegregation case parties necessary for desegre-\ngation of the laboratory school is consistent with the\nbasis of Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board. These\nadditional parties are necessary if the court is to order\ncomplete relief in this case concerning the operation of\nthe laboratory schools. The Presidents of Grambling and\nLouisiana Tech would ultimately be responsible for carrying\nout the directions of the court concerning admission poli-\ncies designed to desegregate those schools, and the state\nofficers would be responsible for implementing any orders\nconcerning state aid to these schools. Since one basis of\nthe federal rules concerning joinder of parties is to elimi-\nnate the necessity of relitigation and to secure complete\nadjudication of issues in one action, see Schutten v. Shell \nOil Company, 421 F.2d 869 (5th Cir. 1970), Gentry v. Smith,\n487 F.2d 571, 579-580 (5th Cir. 1973), all parties necessary\nfor complete relief should have been brought into the original\nschool desegregation case. The elimination of the new and\n\n- 21 -\npotentially duplicative litigation which the district\ncourt order in this case would require is contrary to the\n7/\nbasis of Rule 19,(cid:9) as well as the principle of Hines v.\nRap ides Parish.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, the United States\nrequests that this Court vacate the district court's\ndenial of the motion to add parties defendant and for\nmodification of injunction, and remand this case to the\ndistrict court with directions (a) to order the addition of\nparties the United States sought to join and (b) to address\nthe desegregation of laboratory schools as part of United \nStates v. Lincoln Parish School Board, No. 12071.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDrew S. Days, III\nAssistant Attorney General\nWALTER W. BARNETT\nMARK L. GROSS\nAttorneys\nDepartment of Justice\nWashington, D.

JAMES \n  )   \nLINCOLN PARISH SCHOOL BOARD, et al.,  ) \n  ) \n        Defendants.  ) \n   ) \n \nSUPERSEDING CONSENT ORDER \n \nThis Superseding Consent Order arises out of the good faith efforts of Plaintiff United \nStates of America (the โUnited Statesโ) and Defendant Lincoln Parish School Board (the โBoardโ) \nto address and resolve the Boardโs school desegregation obligations in its operation of the Lincoln \nParish Schools (the โDistrictโ).  This Consent Order is jointly entered into by the United States \nand the Board, and the parties agree to comply with its terms. \nThe Court, having reviewed the terms of this Consent Order, finds that it is consistent with \nthe objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and federal law, and \nwill facilitate the orderly desegregation of the District.  Thus,  \nIT IS ORDERED that the Joint Motion to Approve Superseding Consent Order [Doc. No. \n53] is GRANTED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED as follows: \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  This school desegregation lawsuit was initiated by the United States on June 8, 1966.  On \nAugust 1, 1969, the Court issued a decree (โ1969 Decreeโ) approving a school desegregation plan \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 2 of 20 PageID #:  626\nproposed by the Board, which was โdesigned to . . . disestablish the defendantsโ dual system of \nschools based upon race.โ1  The Court โpermanently enjoined [the Board] from discriminating on \nthe basis of race or color in the operation of their Parish school system,โ and ordered the Board to \nโtake affirmative action to disestablish all school segregation and to eliminate the effects of the \ndual school system.โ2  The desegregation plan was subsequently modified by the Courtโs August \n5, 1970 Decree (โ1970 Decreeโ).  The Court ordered further modifications to certain provisions \nof the plan in the July 23, 1971 Consent Decree and an Order dated August 14, 2008.3 \n  On November 13, 2009, the Court initiated discussions regarding the Boardโs progress \ntoward attaining unitary status.  Since that date, the United States, with the cooperation of the \nBoard, has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Boardโs compliance with its obligations \nunder the operative court orders in this case, including reviewing the Boardโs annual court reports \nin this case, reviewing the Boardโs responses to the United Statesโ various requests for \ninformation, and conducting a site visit of the Districtโs schools in April 2011.  In a Status Report \nfiled on May 24, 2011 (the โStatus Reportโ), the United States reported on the results of its unitary \nstatus review with respect to the Districtโs schools, preliminarily identifying those areas in which \nthe Board remained out of compliance with its desegregation obligations.4  The Board filed a \n                                                           \n1 1969 Decree at 1. \n2 Id. at 1-2. \n3 In a decision dated July 13, 1979, the Fifth Circuit permitted the addition of the laboratory \nschools operated by Louisiana Tech University and Grambling State University as defendants in \nthis case.  A Consent Decree approved by the Court on July 13, 1984 addressed the roles and \nobligations of the various parties with regard to the desegregation of the laboratory schools. The \nBoardโs obligations regarding the laboratory schools, if any, are subject to ongoing proceedings \nbefore the Court and are not addressed or affected by this Consent Order. \n4 Rec. Doc. 25. \n  -2- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 3 of 20 PageID #:  627\nresponse to the Status Report on September 15, 2011.5  The Board subsequently filed its October \n2011 annual court report and produced other documents in response to the United Statesโ requests. \n  Based on the foregoing, the United States has determined that, with respect to its operation \nof the District, the Board has satisfied the requirements for unitary status in the areas of faculty \nassignment, staff assignment, facilities, transportation, and extracurricular activities, and is \nentitled to a declaration of partial unitary status and partial dismissal of this case in those areas.  \nThe United States has further determined that the Board has not yet satisfied its obligations in the \narea of student assignment.  This Consent Order is intended to (1) grant partial unitary status and \ndismiss this case in the areas of faculty assignment, staff assignment, facilities, transportation, and \nextracurricular activities, and (2) address and resolve the outstanding student assignment issues in \nthe District. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \n  The ultimate inquiry in determining whether a school district is unitary is whether the \ndistrict has (1) fully and satisfactorily complied in good faith with the courtโs desegregation orders \nfor a reasonable period of time; (2) eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent \npracticable; and (3) demonstrated a good faith commitment to the whole of the courtโs order and to \nthose provisions of the law and the Constitution which were the predicate for judicial intervention \nin the first instance.6  The Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly referred to as the \nโGreen factors,โ which must be addressed as part of the determination of whether a school district \nhas fulfilled its duties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual school system to the extent \n                                                           \n5 Rec. Doc. 34. \n6 See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 88-89 (1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491-92, 498 \n(1992); Bd. of Educ. of Oklahoma City Pub. Sch., Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 89 v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, \n248-50 (1991). \n  -3- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 4 of 20 PageID #:  628\npracticable.  These factors are:  (1) student assignment; (2) faculty assignment; (3) staff \nassignment; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and (6) facilities.7  A court may \nallow partial or incremental dismissal of a school desegregation case before full compliance has \nbeen achieved in every area of school operations, thereby retaining jurisdiction over those areas \nnot yet in full compliance and terminating jurisdiction over those areas in which compliance was \nfound.8 \nIII.  STIPULATED FACTS \nA.  Student Assignment \n    The 1969 Decree ordered the Board to adopt a desegregation plan โdesigned to . . . \ndisestablish the defendantsโ dual system of schools based upon race.โ9  That plan, as modified by \nthe 1970 Decree, made student assignment changes to disestablish the dual system of schools in \neach of the four geographic zones comprising the District:  Choudrant, Dubach-Hico, Ruston, and \nSimsboro.  The 1969 and 1970 decrees limited intra-district student transfers to three \ncircumstances:  (1) majority-to-minority transfers,10 (2) special needs transfers,11 and \n                                                           \n7 Green v. Cnty. School Bd. of New Kent Cnty., 391 U.S. 430, 435-42 (1968); Jenkins, 515 U.S. at \n88; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250. \n8 Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490-91. \n9 1969 Decree at 1. \n10 โThe school district shall permit a student attending a school in which [the studentโs] race is in \nthe majority to choose to attend another school where [the studentโs] race is in the minority.  All \nsuch transferring students are to be given priority for space and thus the transfer is not to be \ndependent on space being available.  All such transferring students must be given transportation if \nthey desire it.โ  1970 Decree at 4. \n11 โAny student who requires a course of study not offered at the school to which [the student] has \nbeen assigned may be permitted, upon [the studentโs] written application at the beginning of any \nschool term or semester, to transfer to another school which offers courses for [the studentโs] \nspecial needs.โ  1969 Decree at 3. \n  -4- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 5 of 20 PageID #:  629\n(3) transfers to special classes or schools.12  To the extent the Board consented to incoming or \noutgoing inter-district transfers, the 1970 Decree required that such transfers be granted on a \nnon-discriminatory basis, and that they not be granted โwhere the cumulative effect will reduce \ndesegregation in either district or reinforce the dual school system.โ13 \n    In the 2011-2012 school year, the Board operated twelve schools in the four geographic \nzones listed above.  Of the 5,687 students enrolled in the District, 49.3 percent are white, 46.7 \npercent are black, and 4.0 percent are another race.  The 2011-2012 student demographics are set \nforth in Table 1 below. \nTable 1:  Student Enrollment (2011-2012) \nZone  School  White  Black  Other  Total \nChoudrant  Choudrant ES (K-6)  389 (89.4%)  30 (6.9%)  16 (3.7%)  435 \nChoudrant HS (7-12)  288 (88.3%)  32 (9.8%)  6 (1.8%)  326 \nZone-wide  677 (89.0%)  62 (8.1%)  22 (2.9%)  761 \nDubach-  Hico ES (K-5)  122 (61.0%)  63 (31.5%)  15 (7.5%)  200 \nHico  Dubach HS (6-12)  74 (45.4%)  79 (48.5%)  10 (6.1%)  163 \nZone-wide  196 (54.0%)  142 (39.1%)  25 (6.9%)  363 \nRuston  Cypress Springs ES (K-5)  50 (10.9%)  391 (85.0%)  19 (4.1%)  460 \nGlen View ES (K-5)  352 (54.4%)  255 (39.4%)  40 (6.2%)  647 \nHillcrest ES (K-5)  323 (71.0%)  116 (25.5%)  16 (3.5%)  455 \nRuston ES (K-5)  22 (5.3%)  384 (92.3%)  10 (2.4%)  416 \nI.A.

Provided that no such \ntransfers shall be made on the basis of race or color or in a manner which tends to perpetuate a dual \nschool system based on race or color.โ  1969 Decree at 3. \n13 1970 Decree at 5. \n  -5- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 6 of 20 PageID #:  630\n    The Board operates the schools in the Choudrant, Dubach-Hico, and Simsboro zones in a \nsingle-grade structure, such that each of the schools in those zones serves a different range of grade \nlevels.  In the Ruston zone, the Board operates one school serving the sixth grade (I.A. Lewis \nElementary School), one junior high school (Ruston Junior High School), and one high school \n(Ruston High School).  Because all of these schools are operated in a single-grade structure, the \nBoard operates those schools on a desegregated basis and in accordance with federal law and the \noperative court orders in this case. \n    Additionally, the Board operates four K-5 schools in the Ruston attendance zone.  The \nseven (7) schools in the Ruston zone currently serve a total of 3,987 students, of whom 40.6 \npercent are white, 55.9 percent are black, and 3.5 percent are of another race.  The United States \ndetermined that three of the four K-5 elementary schools currently have racially identifiable \nstudent populations.  The United States determined that Cypress Springs Elementary School \n(85.0 percent black) and Ruston Elementary School (92.3 percent black) are racially identifiable \nblack schools, with black student populations exceeding the zone-wide average by 29.1 and 36.4 \npercentage points, respectively.  In contrast, the student population at the predominantly white \nHillcrest Elementary School is 25.5 percent black, 30.4 percentage points below the zone-wide \naverage.  The United States also identified concerns regarding transfers of white students from \nmajority-black to majority-white schools for reasons others than those permitted by the 1969 and \n1970 decrees. \nTo address the student assignment issues identified by the United States, the Board has \nagreed to take certain actions prior to the start of the 2012-2013 school year, including pairing the \n  -6- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 7 of 20 PageID #:  631\nelementary schools in the Ruston zone and revising its student transfer policy, as discussed in \ngreater detail in Section IV.A. below. \n  B.  Faculty Assignment and Staff Assignment \n  Under the 1970 Decree, โprincipals, [] teachers, teacher-aides and other staff who work \ndirectly with children at a school shall be so assigned that in no case will the racial composition of \na staff indicate that a school is intended for black students or white students.โ14  In the 2011-2012 \nschool year, the Board employs 435 teachers, of whom 87.1 percent are white, 12.4 percent are \nblack, and 0.5 percent are of another race.  The 2011-2012 faculty demographics are set forth in \nTable 2 below. \nTable 2:  Faculty Demographics (2011-2012) \nZone  School  White  Black  Other  Total \nChoudrant  Choudrant ES (K-6)  27 (96.4%)  1 (3.6%)  0 (0.0%)  28 \nChoudrant HS (7-12)  28 (93.3%)  2 (6.7%)  0 (0.0%)  30 \nZone-wide  55 (94.8%)  3 (5.2%)  0 (0.0%)  58 \nDubach-  Hico ES (K-5)  15 (88.2%)  2 (11.8%)  0 (0.0%)  17 \nHico  Dubach HS (6-12)  16 (80.0%)  4 (20.0%)  0 (0.0%)  20 \nZone-wide  31 (83.8%)  6 (16.2%)  0 (0.0%)  37 \nRuston  Cypress Springs ES (K-5)  30 (90.9%)  3 (9.1%)  0 (0.0%)  33 \nGlen View ES (K-5)  40 (87.0%)  6 (13.0%)  0 (0.0%)  46 \nHillcrest ES (K-5)  24 (80.0%)  6 (20.0%)  0 (0.0%)  30 \nRuston ES (K-5)  22 (73.3%)  8 (26.7%)  0 (0.0%)  30 \nI.A.

Through faculty reassignment and the closure of its two alternative schools prior to \nthe 2011-2012 school year, the Board addressed the faculty issues identified in Section I.B. of the \nUnited Statesโ Status Report.  The projected faculty 2012-2013 demographics in the Ruston zone \nunder the new grade-level configurations are consistent with the Boardโs obligations.  There are \nno staff assignment issues.  Thus, the Board has eradicated the vestiges of segregation in the areas \nof faculty and staff, and is entitled to a declaration of partial unitary status in those areas. \n    C.  Transportation \n    The 1969 Decree prohibited the Board from segregating or discriminating against any \nstudent on account of race or color in any service, facility, activity, or program, including \ntransportation.15  With respect to transportation, the 1970 Decree further required that โ[b]us[] \nroutes and the assignment of students to buses will be designed to insure the transportation of all \neligible pupils on a non-segregated and otherwise non-discriminatory basis,โ and that โ[t]he \ntransportation system of the school district shall be completely re-examined regularly by the \nsuperintendent, his staff, and the school board.โ16 \n    The United States reviewed transportation data provided by the Board, including pupil \nlocator data for the 2011-2012 school year.  Based on that information, the United States has \ndetermined that the Board provides transportation to all eligible students enrolled in the District on \na nondiscriminatory basis.  Upon review of information provided by the Board after the United \nStatesโ Status Report, including 2011-2012 student enrollment data and geographic information \nsystem (GIS) data, the United States determined that the concerns expressed in Section I.C. of the \n                                                           \n15 1969 Decree at 4. \n16 1970 Decree at 4. \n  -8- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 9 of 20 PageID #:  633\nStatus Report were no longer an issue.  Thus, the Board is entitled to a declaration of partial \nunitary status in the area of transportation. \n    D.  Extracurricular Activities \n    The 1970 Decree prohibited the Board โfrom maintaining any . . . non-classroom, or \nextra-curricular activity on a segregated basis, so that no student is effectively excluded from . . . \nparticipating in any non-classroom or extra-curricular activity on the basis of race, color, or \nnational origin.โ17  The United States reviewed information provided by the Board concerning \nextracurricular activities.  The District provides all students an opportunity to participate in \nextracurricular activities on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Thus, the Board is entitled to a declaration \nof partial unitary status in the area of extracurricular activities. \n    E.  Facilities \nThe 1969 and 1970 decrees further required that the Board eliminate the vestiges of  \nsegregation in its school facilities.  The United States reviewed facilities information provided by \nthe Board and conducted a site visit of all school facilities in the Ruston zone in April 2011, and \nhas determined that the Board operates all of the Districtโs school facilities in a nondiscriminatory \nmanner in compliance with its desegregation obligations.  Thus, the Board is entitled to a \ndeclaration of partial unitary status in the area of facilities. \nIV.  STIPULATED REMEDIAL MEASURES \n  The Board agrees to take the following measures to address the outstanding student \nassignment issues in this case, as described above in Section III.A.  The Board has agreed to \nimplement, as a practicable tool to address and correct these issues, the following plan for the \n2012-2013 school year.  The parties agree, and the Court finds, that such relief, as detailed below, \n                                                           \n17 1970 Decree at 5. \n  -9- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 10 of 20 PageID #:  634\nif fully implemented, will correct the remaining student assignment issues and result in the unitary \noperation of the District in the area of student assignment. \n  A.  Elementary School Student Assignment in the Ruston Zone \n  The Board has approved and agrees to implement, by the beginning of the 2012-2013 \nschool year, a student assignment plan that will eliminate the racial identifiability of Cypress \nSprings Elementary School, Hillcrest Elementary School, and Ruston Elementary School, three of \nthe four elementary schools currently serving grades K-5 in the Ruston zone.  Under this plan, the \nBoard will create two pairs of schools using existing attendance zone boundaries and \ntransportation routes.  Each pair will contain a K-2 school and 3-5 school.  Additionally, the \nexisting โfreedom of choiceโ zone, which currently enables students who reside within that zone to \nchoose to attend school in either Simsboro or Ruston, will be abolished.  As indicated on the map \nin Exhibit A, that zone will be divided such that students residing in that zone will be assigned to \nattend either the Simsboro or Ruston zone. \n  In the first pair, to be known as the โHillcrest-Rustonโ attendance zone, Hillcrest \nElementary School will serves grades K-2 and Ruston Elementary School wills serve grades 3-5.  \nUnless granted a transfer for one of the permissible reasons set forth below in Section IV.B., all \nstudents who reside in the existing Ruston and Hillcrest zones will attend the schools in the new \nHillcrest-Ruston attendance zone.  In the second pair, to be known as the โGlenview-Cypress \nSpringsโ attendance zone, Glenview Elementary School will serve grades K-2 and Cypress \nSprings Elementary School will serve grades 3-5.  Unless granted a transfer for one of the \npermissible reasons set forth below in Section IV.B., all students who reside in the existing \nCypress Springs and Glenview zones (except for those students in the former โfreedom of choiceโ \n  -10- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 11 of 20 PageID #:  635\nzone who will now be assigned to the Simsboro zone) will attend the schools in the new Cypress \nSprings-Glenview attendance zone.  All Ruston students in grades 6 through 12 will continue to \nattend I.A. Lewis Elementary School, Ruston Junior High School, and Ruston High School under \nthe existing grade level configurations. \n  The projected student demographics at the elementary schools in the Ruston zone are set \nforth below in Table 3.  \nTable 3:  Projected 2012-2013 Ruston Zone Elementary Student Enrollment* \nPair  School  White  Black  Other  Total \nGlenview-Cypress  Glenview (K-2)  293 (44.0%)  345 (51.8%)  28 (4.2%)  666 \nSprings  Cypress Springs (3-5)  241 (40.0%)  321 (53.2%)  41 (6.8%)  603 \nTotal K-5  534 (42.1%)  666 (52.5%)  69 (5.4%)  1269 \nHillcrest-Ruston  Hillcrest (K-2)  208 (39.9%)  284 (54.5%)  29 (5.6%)  521 \nRuston (3-5)  176 (41.0%)  238 (55.5%)  15 (3.5%)  429 \nTotal K-5  384 (40.4%)  522 (54.9%)  44 (4.6%)  950 \n* Projections are based on 2011-2012 enrollment figures. \n \n  The projected ratios of black and white students at all Ruston schools will approximate \nzone- and District-wide averages.  To the extent faculty reassignments between schools are \nnecessary to implement this student assignment plan, the Board will ensure that the percentages of \nblack and white faculty at each school remain within plus/minus 15 percentage points of the \nDistrict-wide averages.  Based on these projections, the United States has concluded that, if \nrealized, the Board will meet its obligation to ensure that each of its Ruston zone schools will no \nlonger be racially identifiable beginning in the 2012-2013 school year. \nA.  Student Transfers \nThe Board has approved and will immediately implement the following student transfer \npolicy.  No student transfer will be permitted other than those approved, according to the \nprovisions herein, by the Transfer Committee, which will be composed of three supervisory staff \n  -11- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 12 of 20 PageID #:  636\nmembers appointed by the Superintendent.  The decision of the Transfer Committee on student \ntransfer requests will be made in compliance with the provisions stated below and will be final and \nwithout appeal to the School Board.  All transfer requests for the upcoming school year will be \naccepted and considered during the period of May 1 through July 30, 2012, and May 1 through \nJune 30 of each year thereafter.  The Transfer Committee may approve transfer requests \nsubmitted after July 30, 2012 or June 30 of subsequent years only if such requests are based upon \none of reasons (1) through (6) below which did not arise or was not known to the applicant prior to \nthe deadline, as evidenced by supporting documentation, and if the request otherwise complies \nwith the other terms of these provisions.  No transfer will be approved that does not meet at least \none of the following six approved reasons for transfer. \n    1.  Majority-to-Minority \n  A student attending a school where the studentโs race is in the majority may elect to attend \na school of appropriate grade level in any attendance zone in the District where the studentโs race \nis in the minority, subject to the following requirements. \n      a.  To determine whether a transfer is, in fact, one that is eligible as a \nMajority-to-Minority transfer, the Transfer Committee will calculate the student racial \npercentages at each school based on the student enrollment data on the last day of the school year \nprior to school year in which the student seeks to enroll in the receiving school. \n      b.  A Majority-to-Minority transfer will automatically continue \nyear-to-year until the student completes the last grade level at the school, or until the student \nnotifies the Transfer Committee of an intent to return to the school to which the student would \nnormally be assigned based on the studentโs home address. \n  -12- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 13 of 20 PageID #:  637\n      c.  A Majority-to-Minority transfer request will be given priority for space \nat the receiving school among other students requesting transfers to the same school for other \nreasons, and the Majority-to-Minority transfer is not to be dependent on space being available. \n      d.  The Board will provide transportation to and from the receiving school \nfor any student granted a Majority-to-Minority transfer unless it is rejected by the student. \n      e.  Students who transfer pursuant to this section will be immediately \neligible to participate on athletic teams at the first high school to which they transfer under this \nprovision. \n      f.  The Board will provide transportation to facilitate participation in \nathletics and other extracurricular activities to students who transfer under this provision. \n    2.  Specialized Academic, Vocational, Athletic, or Special Education \nCurriculum Not Offered in the School of Residence \n  The Transfer Committee may grant any student who elects or requires a course of study or \nother specialized academic, vocational, athletic, or special education program or curriculum not \noffered at the school to which the student has been assigned a transfer to another school that offers \nsuch program or curriculum, subject to the following requirements. \n      a.  The studentโs transfer application must include (1) a verification signed \nby the principal of the sending school that the specific program and/or curriculum is not available \nat his school, and (2) by the principal of the receiving school that the specific program or \ncurriculum is available at his school and that the student has qualified for such program or \ncurriculum. \n  -13- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 14 of 20 PageID #:  638\n      b.  An application for such a transfer based on non-academic programs \nmay be denied if it is determined by the Transfer Committee that the cumulative effect of all \ntransfer requests for the given year would reinforce a perception that either the sending school or \nreceiving school is intended for a particular race, or would otherwise frustrate the Boardโs \ndesegregation obligations in this case. \n      c.  Under Louisiana High School Athletic Association rules, any student \nwho transfers based on the unavailability of an athletic program at the sending school will not be \nimmediately eligible to participate in competitive high school athletics, unless such transfer \nqualifies and is designated as a Majority-to-Minority transfer, as provided above. \n    3.  Health of the Student \n    The Transfer Committee may grant a transfer to a student whose attendance at the \nstudentโs assigned school would place the studentโs physical or mental health in jeopardy and \nwhere attendance at another school would better meet the studentโs health needs.  The studentโs \napplication for such a transfer must include a statement of support signed by at least two \nnon-associated medical doctors or mental health providers certifying the studentโs health \ncondition, explaining in detail why attendance at the sending school places the studentโs health in \njeopardy, and explaining in detail why attendance at the requested school is better for the studentโs \nhealth condition.  At least one of the doctors providing a supporting letter must be the studentโs \ntreating physician. \n    4.  Safety of the Student \n    The Transfer Committee may grant a transfer to any student whose safety is in \njeopardy if attendance continues at the sending school.  A studentโs application for such a transfer \n  -14- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 15 of 20 PageID #:  639\nmust include a statement signed by the studentโs parent/guardian and/or the principal of the \nsending school outlining the potential harm to the student in that school, together with any \nsupporting documentation that may be available, and a statement on how the transfer would \naddress the studentโs specific safety concerns. \n    5.  Child of a full-time certificated employee. \n    The Transfer Committee may grant a transfer to any student enrolled in grades \nK-12 who is the child of a full-time, certificated school district employee, and is verified as \nactually living with said employee, to attend a school of applicable grade level within the \nattendance zone of the school where the parent/guardian works, subject to the following \nrequirements. \n      a.  A studentโs application for such a transfer must include a verification \nfrom the Districtโs personnel office of the parentโs/guardianโs employment status with the Board, \njob title, and school assignment for the next school year. \n      b.  A certificated employeeโs child who is also eligible for a \nMajority-to-Minority transfer will be granted a Majority-to-Minority transfer in lieu of a transfer \nas a child of a certificated employee and may, therefore, elect to attend any school in the District \nfor which the student is eligible under that transfer provision. \n    6.  Exceptional hardship \n    The Transfer Committee may grant a transfer for an exceptional hardship arising \nfrom a situation that does not fall within any of the student transfer provisions listed above, but \nwhich warrant the transfer of that student to another school in the District (including, but not \nlimited to, a natural disaster, incarceration of the custodial parent/guardian, severe illness of a \n  -15- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 16 of 20 PageID #:  640\nparent/guardian, domestic abuse in the studentโs home, neglect or other child welfare needs).  A \ntransfer may be granted to a student where an exceptional hardship is demonstrated, subject to the \nfollowing requirements. \n      a.  The studentโs parent/guardian and/or an appropriate child welfare \nofficial may apply for an exceptional hardship transfer and must include in such application a \nsigned, dated, and notarized statement providing a detailed explanation of the exceptional \nhardship, why the hardship requires a transfer from the sending school, why the receiving school \ncan best accommodate the exceptional hardship, and supporting documentation, if any is \nreasonably available to the applicant.  \n      b.  In addition to many other circumstances that may also not qualify as an \nexceptional hardship, child care needs will not qualify as an exceptional hardship under this \nprovision. \n    4.  Term of Transfers. All transfers (except Majority-to-Minority  \ntransfers, as provided above) will be effective for one school year only.  A student must submit an \napplication and be reconsidered and approved by the Transfer Committee for each succeeding \nyear.  \n    5.  Transportation of Transfer Students. Majority-to-Minority transfer \nstudents will be entitled to transportation provided by the School Board.  All other transfer \nstudents must provide their own transportation. \n  C.  Training \n  To facilitate the transition and effective implementation of the student assignment changes \nrequired by this Consent Order, the Board will provide training to staff and parents during the \n  -16- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 17 of 20 PageID #:  641\n2012-2013 school year on issues related to racial diversity.  The Board will seek the assistance of \nand, if available, will work cooperatively with the Intercultural Development Research \nAssociation (IDRA) South Central Collaborative for Equity18 to the extent it is able to provide \nassistance to the Board in such training. \n    D.  Monitoring and Reporting \n      1.  Reports.  On or before October 15 and April 15 of each year during the \nterm of this Consent Order, the Board will file with the Court a report containing the following \ninformation related to the Ruston zone attendance plan and the Boardโs student transfer policies: \n        a.  A table listing the number and percentage of students, by race, at each \nschool in the Ruston zone, as well as Ruston zone-wide and District-wide student demographics. \n      b.  For each of the four K-5 elementary schools in the Ruston zone, a list of \nall students, by assigned homeroom teacher, listing each studentโs name, race, and physical home \naddress (no P.O. boxes).  For this reason, the October 15 and April 15 reports SHALL be filed \nunder seal. \n      c.  For each of the four K-5 elementary schools in the Ruston zone, a list of \nall administrators, teachers, and certificated staff, indicating each employeeโs job title, position, \nand race. \n      d.  A spreadsheet providing the following information for all transfer \nrequests made since the prior report for or during the current school year: (a) the name, race, and \nphysical address of the requesting student; (b) the basis for the request; (c) whether the request was \ngranted or denied; and, if the request was denied, the basis for that decision.  The Board agrees to \n                                                           \n18 The IDRA South Central Collaborative for Equity is the federally-funded equity assistance \ncenter for the region including Louisiana which provides technical assistance, training, and other \nresources on equity and diversity issues to school districts free of charge. \n  -17- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 18 of 20 PageID #:  642\nsubmit the transfer information in the form of a spreadsheet which, if possible, will be submitted to \nthe United States in an electronic format utilizing Microsoft Excel or a compatible program. \n      e.  A narrative description of the Boardโs efforts to implement the new \nstudent assignment plan since the date of the previous report. \n    2.  Objections.  If the United States has any objections to the Boardโs \nimplementation of the Ruston zone attendance plan or the transfer policy during a given reporting \nperiod, such objections will be made, in writing, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the report for \nsubject period.  The parties will attempt to resolve any disputes voluntarily but either party may \nseek the assistance of the Court if they are unable to resolve any issues within a reasonable period \nof time. \n    3.  Prior Reporting Requirements Superseded.  The reporting requirements \noutlined above will supersede and replace all other reporting requirements ordered by the Court. \n  E.  Modifications.  For any modifications to any of the terms of this Consent Order \nrelated to the Ruston zone attendance plan or the transfer policy, the Board must seek the United \nStatesโ consent and obtain approval of the Court through an appropriate motion, which may be \nfiled with or without consent. \n \nV.  FINAL TERMINATION \n  Having found that the Board has satisfied its desegregation obligations in the areas of \nfaculty assignment, staff assignment, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities in the \noperation of the Districtโs schools, the Court hereby declares the Board unitary in those areas, \ndismisses the permanent injunction as to those issues, and withdraws its jurisdiction over those \nareas of operation of the Districtโs schools. \n  -18- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 19 of 20 PageID #:  643\n  Continued judicial supervision of the Board, in its operations of the Districtโs schools, will \nbe limited to ensuring compliance with the terms set forth above regarding the implementation of \nthe Ruston zone attendance plan and the transfer policy.  The United States and the Board have \ncommitted to negotiate in good faith any disputes that may arise, but either party will have the right \nto seek judicial resolution of any issue related to compliance with this Consent Order. \n  The Board retains the burden of eliminating any vestiges of de jure segregation which may \ncontinue to exist in the areas still under this Courtโs supervision.  The parties have agreed and the \nCourt finds that the Board will meet its desegregation obligations in the remaining areas of its \noperation of the Districtโs schools if it implements the Ruston attendance zone plan and the \ntransfer policy, both as set forth above.  Therefore, upon demonstration of successful \nimplementation of such provisions, the Board may move for a declaration of unitary status on the \nissue of student assignment no sooner than thirty (30) days after the submission of its October 15, \n2013 court report.  The applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the local \nrules of this Court will apply to any such motion. \n  The United States and the Board specifically agree and the Court finds that this Consent \nOrder will have no effect upon any issues related to the desegregation of the laboratory schools \noperated at Louisiana Tech University and/or Grambling State University.  Particularly, this \nConsent Order will not affect, in any way, any issues related to any obligation of the Board under \nor its compliance with any provision of the 1984 Consent Decree relative to the desegregation of \nthe laboratory schools, and the Board will remain a party to this case until it has satisfactorily \ncomplied with all such obligations. \n \n  -19- \n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 55   Filed 05/24/12   Page 20 of 20 PageID #:  644\nSO ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED,  \nthis 24th day of May, 2012. \n \n  -20- ",

In 2012, this Court approved a Superseding Consent Order which granted the Board partial\nunitary status in all areas of the operation of the Districtโs schools, except student assignment, and set\nout certain obligations to reconfigure the elementary schools in the Ruston attendance zone.1 After the\nBoard implemented the elementary school reconfiguration requirements, the United States notified the\nBoard that it had concerns regarding the racial composition of the elementary school classrooms and\nthe Boardโs classroom assignment process.  In 2015, this Court approved a Supplemental Consent\n1 Superseding Consent Order, Record Document 55.\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 265   Filed 01/18/17   Page 2 of 7 PageID #:  7255\nOrder setting particular requirements for the classroom assignment process,2 which the United States\nagrees have been properly and fully implemented by the Board.   \nThe Court, having reviewed the terms of this Consent Order, finds that the Board has complied\nwith its obligations under the relevant orders, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and applicable federal law and, therefore, has effectively eradicated to the extent practicable\nany remaining vestiges of the prior de jure segregated education system in the area of student assignment. \nInasmuch as student assignment was the last area of operation for which the Board had not achieved\nunitary status, this Courtโs finding as to student assignment entitles the Board to a declaration of full\nunitary status, withdrawal of judicial supervision, and entry of a final judgment dismissing it from this\naction. \nFor the following reasons, \nIT IS ORDERED that the Joint Motion to Approve Consent Order Declaring Unitary Status\nand Dismissing Action and for Final Judgment of Dismissal [Doc. No. 264] is GRANTED, and the\nLincoln Parish School Board is declared UNITARY in all regards and is DISMISSED from this case.\nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nSince this public school desegregation action was initiated by the United States in 1966, the\nCourt has issued multiple orders designed to disestablish the former de jure segregated system of public\nelementary and secondary education in Lincoln Parish.  The history of this case has been recounted on\nmultiple occasions and a full recitation is unnecessary here; however, the Court incorporates by\nreference the historical facts generally and relative to student assignment as set forth in the Superseding\nConsent Order entered on May 24, 2012, at Record Document 55, pages 1-6, and the Supplemental\nConsent Order entered on June 2, 2015, at Record Document 151, pages 1-7.   \n2 Supplemental Consent Order, Record Document 151.\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 265   Filed 01/18/17   Page 3 of 7 PageID #:  7256\nIn the 2012 Superseding Consent Order, the Court granted partial unitary status and dismissed\nthe case against the Board in all areas of the operation of the Districtโs schools, except student\nassignment, and set certain obligations for the reconfiguration of the elementary schools in the Ruston\nattendance zone and student transfers district-wide.3 On June 2, 2015, and, following the successful\nimplementation of the school reconfiguration as required by the 2012 Superseding Consent Order, the\nCourt approved the 2015 Supplemental Consent Order which required the implementation of a\nclassroom assignment plan in those reconfigured schools.4  Pursuant to the 2015 Supplemental Consent\nOrder, the Board was authorized to move for unitary status and dismissal of the case no sooner than\nsixty (60) days following the submission of its October 15, 2016 court report.5  Upon the expiration of\nthat period, the Parties jointly moved for approval of their agreement to grant full unitary status and\nfinal dismissal of the case with respect to the operation of the Boardโs schools.\nII. LAW AND ANALYSIS\nA. Legal Standards\nWhen determining whether a public school district has achieved unitary status, the courtโs\nultimate inquiry is whether the district has (1) fully and satisfactorily complied in good faith with the\ncourtโs desegregation orders for a reasonable time; (2) eliminated the vestiges of the prior de jure\nsegregation to the extent practicable; and (3) demonstrated a good faith commitment to the whole of\nthe courtโs order and to the provisions of the United States Constitution and federal law which were the\nbasis for judicial intervention in the first instance.6  The United States Supreme Court has identified six\n3 The particulars of the reconfiguration requirements are set forth in this Superseding Consent Order and are incorporated\nby reference herein.

Analysis\nThe Court previously declared the Board unitary in all areas of the operation of the Districtโs\nschools, except student assignment.9  As demonstrated by the data and information contained in its\nreports filed with the Court, the Board complied with the reconfiguration and transfer requirements\ncontained in the 2012 Superseding Consent Order beginning with school year 2012-2013.10\nThe 2015 Supplemental Consent Order set out multiple obligations regarding the classroom\nassignment process at the four (4) elementary schools in the Ruston attendance zone: Cypress Springs,\nGlen View, Hillcrest, and Ruston.  First, the Board was required to eliminate ability grouping and to\nensure that students of all academic levels were assigned to each homeroom heterogeneously.  The\nBoard was also required to assign students to each homeroom with a goal that the percentage of black\nstudents and white students in each class approximate those percentages in the respective grade at that\n7 Green v. County of Sch. Bd. of New Kent Cnty., 391 U.S. 430, 435-42 (1968): Jenkins, 515 U.S. at 88; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250.\n8 See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490-91; see also Price v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 945 F.2d 1307, 1314 (5th Cir.1991).\n9 [Doc.

FINAL TERMINATION\nHaving found that the Lincoln Parish School Board has satisfied its desegregation obligations\nin the final supervised area of student assignment, the Court hereby declares the Board to be unitary in\n11[Doc.

The Court further finds that, because the Board has now eliminated the vestiges of past\nsegregation in all areas of the operation of its schools, it is entitled to full and final dismissal from this\naction.  All other orders of this Court with respect to Civil Action No. 66-12071 not inconsistent\nherewith shall remain in full force and effect.15  \nA final judgment dismissing the Board from this action shall issue.\nMONROE, LOUISIANA, this 18th day of January, 2017.\n15 Consistent with its prior orders, the Court will continue to supervise the desegregation of (i) the A.E. Phillips Laboratory\nSchool (โA.E. Phillipsโ), located on the campus of Louisiana Tech University, and (ii) the former Grambling Laboratory\nSchools, which are now known as the Lincoln Preparatory School (โLincoln Prepโ).  Though the Board has no further legal\nobligations relative to the desegregation of those schools [Doc. Nos. 231 & 232], it has offered to voluntarily provide annual\nstudent, faculty, and staff data regarding its schools, if requested by the Court, the United States, or the other remaining\nparties to this litigation, to facilitate the Courtโs comparative assessment and review of A.E.

JAMES,  District  Judge. \nPending  before  the  Court  is  a  Motion  for  Relief  under  the  All  Writs  Act  [Doc.  No.  62]  filed  by  the \nUnited  States  of America,  Department  of Justice  (\"DOJ\").  DOJ  has  moved  the  Court  under the  All \nWrits  Act,  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1651,  to  compel  a  non-party,  the  Louisiana  Department  of  Education \n(\"LDOE\"),  to  provide  responses  to  interrogatories  and  requests  for  production  related  to  the  State's \nprivate  school  scholarship  program.  On  January  18,  2013,  the  LDOE  filed  a  memorandum  in \nopposition  [Doc.  No.  66]  to  the  DOUJ's  motion. \n584*584  For  the  following  reasons,  the  DOJ's  motion  is  GRANTED  IN  PART  and  DENIED  IN  PART \nas  MOOT,  and  the  LDOE  is  hereby  ORDERED  to  provide  responses  to  Interrogatories  Nos.  1-5  and \n8  and  Request  for  Production  No.  1,  to  the  extent  not  already  provided,  no  later  than  March  1,  2013. \nThe  motion  is  DENIED  as  MOOT  as  to  Interrogatories  Nos.  6  and  7,  subject  to  the  right  of the  DOJ \nto  re-propound  these  interrogatories  at  a  later  date. \n1.  BACKGROUND  AND  PERTINENT  FACTS \nThe  desegregation  case  has  been  pending  since  June  8,  1966.  The  original  consent  decree  was \nentered  by  the  Honorable  Ben  C.  Dawkins,  Jr.,  on  August  1,  1969.  Under the  decree,  the  Lincoln \nParish  School  Board  (\"School  Board\")  agreed  to  take  the  following  remedial  measures: \n(1)  Allowing  student  transfers  in  only  the  following  situations:\nA.  When  a  student  in  the  majority  race  at  his  school  transfers  to  a  school  where  he  will  be  in  the \nminority  race; \nB.  When  a  student  requires  a  course  of study  not  offered  at  the  school  to  which  he  has  been \nassigned  and  transfers  to  a  school  which  offers  courses  for  his  special  needs; \nC.  When  a  student  is  physically  handicapped,  mentally  retarded,  or  gifted  and  transfers  schools  or \nclasses  because  another  school  or  class  will  be  better  equipped  to  accommodate  him; \nD.  All  transfers  must  be  granted  on  a  non-discriminatory  basis  and  may  not  reduce  desegregation  or \nreinforce  the  dual  school  system. \n(2)  Forbidding  segregation  or  discrimination  on  account  of  race  or  color  in  any  service,  facility, \nactivity,  or  program,  including  transportation,  athletics,  and  other  extracurricular  activities,  conducted \nor  sponsored  by  the  school. \n(3)  Equalizing  schools  formerly  maintained  for African-Americans  and  creating  remedial  programs \nfor  students  who  previously  attended  segregated  schools  to  overcome  past  inadequacies  in  their \neducation. \n(4)  Conducting  all  school  construction,  school  consolidation,  and  site  selection  so  as  to  eliminate  the \nexistence  of the  dual  school  system  and  its  recurrence. \n(5)  Desegregating  faculty  and  staff  and  employing  all  principals,  teachers,  teacher-aides,  and  staff \non  a  nondiscriminatory  basis. \n(6)  Requiring  the  Lincoln  Parish  School  Board  to  file  an  annual  report,  tracking  the  racial  makeup  of \nemployees  and  students  at  each  school,  as  well  as  filing  a  report  when  construction  plans  were \nsubmitted  to  the  school  board. \nThe  decree  has  been  modified  several  times  through  the  years  to  permit  the  implementation  of  a \nmajority-to-minority  transfer  policy,  to  provide  for the  examination  of the  transportation  system,  to \ncreate  a  bi-racial  committee,  to  consolidate  schools,  to  modify  reporting  requirements,  and  to  change \nattendance  zones. \nSince  1984,  the  Court  has  considered  actions  necessary  to  address  the  two  laboratory  schools \nlocated  in  Lincoln  Parish:  the  Grambling  laboratory  school  (Alma  J.  Brown  Elementary,  Grambling \nMiddle  School,  and  Grambling  High  School)  and  the  A.E.  Phillips  Laboratory \nSchool.โ  On  585*585  October  8,  1984,  the  Honorable  Thomas  E.  Stagg,  Jr.,  issued  a  consent \ndecree  which  set  forth  a  plan  to  desegregate  the  two  schools. \nFor  more  than  forty  years,  the  School  Board  has  provided  statistical  reports  to  the  Court,  requested \nauthorization  for  any  actions  which  could  affect  desegregation,  and  the  DOJ  has  monitored  the \nSchool  Board's  desegregation  efforts.  In  late  2009,  the  Court  began  meeting  with  the  parties  in  all \nactive  desegregation  cases  in  the  Monroe  Division  to  determine  the  actions  necessary  for  the \ndistricts  to  obtain  unitary  status  and  for  the  cases  to  be  finally  resolved.  Consistent  with  that  goal,  on \nDecember  14,  2009,  the  Court  held  a  status  conference  with  the  parties  in  this  case  and,  acting  sua \nsponte,  ordered  the  DOJ  to  conduct  a  unitary  status  review  of the  District.  See  [Doc.  No.  8].  Since \nthat  time,  the  Court,  the  School  Board,  the  DOJ,  and  the  laboratory  schools  have  been  engaged  in \non-going  efforts  to  resolve  the  remaining  desegregation  issues.  Nevertheless,  as  of this  date,  the \ncase  remains  open  and  active. \nIn  April  2012,  during  the  Regular  Session,  the  Louisiana  Legislature  enacted  legislation  known  as \nthe  Student  Scholarships  for  Educational  Excellence  Act,  implemented  through  Act  No.  2.  See  LA. \nREV.  STAT.  ANN.  ยงยง  17:4011-4025.  The  state  scholarship  program  (\"the  Program\")  allows  students \nin  Louisiana  parishes  who  (1)  have  family  incomes  below  250%  of the  poverty  line  and  (2)  are \nenrolled  in  a  school  that  received  a  grade  of  \"C\"  or  lower  on  LDOE's  accountability  scale  to  attend \nparticipating  private  schools  or  certain  high-performing  public  schools.  See  LA.  REV.  STAT.  ANN.  ยงยง \n17:4013-4018.  For  any  student  who  participates  in  the  Program,  Minimum  Foundation  Program \n(\"MFP\")  funds,  state  funds  intended  for  public  education,  follow  the  student  to  the  new  school.  See \nid.  ยง  17:4016.\nOn  May  24,  2012,  the  Court  approved  the  Superseding  Consent  Order  [Doc.  No.  55]  in  this  case, \nrequiring  the  School  Board  to  take  additional  actions  to  comply  with  its  student  assignment \nobligations,  as  well  as  retaining  its  duty  to  eliminate  the  vestiges  of  de jure  segregation. \nIn  Lincoln  Parish,  there  are  thirteen  schools  which  received  a  grade  of  \"C\"  or  lower:  Choudrant \nElementary  School,  Cypress  Springs  Elementary  School,  Dubach  High  School,  Glen  View \nElementary  School,  Hico  Elementary  School,  Howard  School,  |.A.  Lewis  School,  Ruston  Elementary \nSchool,  Ruston  Junior  High  School,  Simsboro  High  School,  Alma  J.  Brown  Elementary  School, \nGrambling  Middle  School,  and  Grambling  High  School.  Any  student  who  attends  these  schools  and \nwhose  family  meets  the  income  requirement  is  eligible  to  participate  in  the  Program. \nPrior to  filing  its  motion,  the  DOJ  requested  information  and  documentation  from  the  LDOE  related  to \nthe  Lincoln  Parish  students  who  applied  for  and/or  are  participating  in  the  Program,  as  well  as \ninformation  on  the  schools  participating  in  the  Program.  The  LDOE  refused  to  provide  the \ninformation,  citing  the  Family  Educational  Rights  and  Privacy  Act  (\"FERPA\"),  20  U.S.C.  ยง  1232g. \nThe  LDOE  contends  that  release  of the  information  and  documentation  without  a  subpoena  or  court \norder would  potentially  violate  FERPA  and  jeopardize  its  federal  education  funding. \n586*586  After  its  unsuccessful  attempt  to  obtain  the  information  from  the  LDOE,  the  DOJ  filed  the \ninstant  Motion  for  Relief  Under  the  All  Writs  Act.  [Doc.  No.  62].  The  DOJ  attached  its  interrogatories \nand  request  for  production  to  the  motion.  The  LDOE  filed  a  memorandum  in  opposition  to  the \nmotion.  [Doc.  No.  66]. \nAfter filing  the  motion,  with  the  Court's  assistance,  the  DOJ  was  able  to  obtain  some  information \nfrom  the  School  Board,  which  had  been  provided  to  the  School  Board  by  the  LDOE.  This  information \nwas  not  fully  responsive,  however,  to  the  DOJ's  discovery  requests.  Therefore,  the  DOJ  continued  to \npursue  its  motion. \nOn  January  30,  2013,  in  a  joint  conference  with  the  Court's  law  clerk,  the  DOJ  and  the  LDOE \nreported  that  they  had  met  and  discussed  the  pending  motion.  In  order to  resolve  the  motion,  the \nDOJ  agreed  to  withdraw  its  Interrogatories  Nos.  6  and  7,  to  which  the  LDOE  raised  relevancy \nobjections,  subject  to  the  DO's  right  to  re-propound  those  interrogatories  at  a  later  date.  In \nresponse  to  the  DOu's  Interrogatory  No.  8  requesting  funding  information  on  the  Program,  the  LDOE \nhad  provided  a  deposition  used  in  another  recent  case.  With  regard  to  the  remaining  interrogatories \nand  request  for  production,  the  LDOE  still  contends  that  the  release  of the  information  and \ndocuments  is  prohibited  by  FERPA  and  that  it  cannot  act  without  a  subpoena  or  court  order. \nSubject  to  the  agreements  set  forth  above,  the  DOJ's  motion  remains  pending  before  the  Court. \nll.  ALL  WRITS  ACT \nThe  All  Writs  Act  provides  \"power  [to]  a  federal  court  to  issue  such  commands  ...  aS  may  be \nnecessary  or  appropriate  to  effectuate  and  prevent  the  frustration  of  orders  it  has  previously  issued \nin  its  exercise of  jurisdiction  otherwise  obtained.\"  United  States  v.  N.Y.  Tel.  Co.,  434  U.S.  159,  172, \n98  S.Ct.  364,  54  L.Ed.2d  376  (1977);  see  also  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1651(a).  This  p ower  extends  to  non- \n parties  \"when  their  conduct  frustrates  the  court's  order.\"  Moore  v.  Tangipahoa  Parish  Sch.  Bd.,  No. \n12-31218,  2013  WL  141791,  at  *6  (Sth  Cir.  Jan.  13,  2013)   (citing  N.Y.  Tel.,  4 34  U.S.  at  174,  98  S.Ct. \n3 64).  For  a  district  court  to  act ,  three  elements  must  be  satisfied.   \"First,  โthe  party  s eeking  issuance \nof the  writ  [must]  have  no  other  adequate  means  to  attain  the  relief  he  desires.  /d.  (quoting  Cheney \nv.  U.S.  Dist.  Court  for D.C.,  542  U.S.  367,  380,  124  S.Ct.  2576,  159  L.Ed.2d  459  (2004)  (alteration  in \n original)).  \"When  alternative  means  of  relief  are  available,  the  court  should  not  issue  a \nwrit.\"  /d.  \"Second,  the  party  seeking  the  writ  must  meet  its  โburden  of  showing  that  [its]  right  to \nissuance  of the  writ  is  clear  and  indisputable.\"  /d.  at  *6-7  (quoting  Cheney,  542  U.S.  at  381,  124 \nS.Ct.  2576  (citation  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  \"Third,  assuming  the  p etition  meets  the \nfirst  two  requirements,  a  court  should  exercise  discretion  before  issuing  a  writ  to  ensure  it  โis \nappropriate  under  the  circumstances.\"  /d.  at  *7  (quoting  Cheney,  542  U.S.  at  381,  124  S.Ct.  2576) \n(citation  omitted)). \nIn  this  case,  the  DOJ  contends  that  the  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  on-going  desegregation  case, \nthat  it  is  entitled  to  obtain  the  requested  information  and  documents  from  the  LDOE  as  part  of  its \nduties  in  this  case,  and  that  it  is  unable  to  obtain  the  information  and  documents  because  of the \nLDOE's  FERPA  assertion.  In  response,  the  LDOE  contends  that  the  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  to \nconsider  the  All  Writs  Motion  or  should  abstain  under  the  Pullman  doctrine  based  on  the  Fifth \nCircuit's  recent  decision  in  Moore.  Alternatively,  the  LDOE  contends  that  the  Court \nshould  587*587  deny  the  DO's  motions  because  (1)  the  release  of the  information  would  violate \nFERPA,  which  would  threaten  federal  funding  for  the  State;  (2)  the  information  sought  is  irrelevant  to \nits  stated  purpose;  and  (3)  the  information  has  been  provided  or  is  readily  available  to  the  public. \nA.  Jurisdiction \nFirst,  the  Court  must  consider  the  jurisdictional  question,  which  was  recently  addressed  in  an \nunpublished  Fifth  Circuit  decision.  In  Moore,  the  desegregation  plaintiffs  and  the  Tangipahoa  School \nBoard  filed  an  All  Writs  motion,  seeking  injunctions  against  the  LDOE  to  stop  the  further \nimplementation  of  certain  provisions  of Act  1  and  2  of the  2012  Regular  Session  of the  Louisiana \nLegislature,  including  the  Program.  Following  a  November  26,  2012  hearing,  the  Honorable  Judge \nIvan  Lemelle  granted  the  motion.  On  November  28,  2012,  Judge  Lemelle  entered  an  order  enjoining \nthe  provisions  of Acts  1  and  2,  including  the  Program,  in  Tangipahoa  Parish.  The  following  day, \nJudge  Lemelle  denied  the  State's  request  for  a  stay.  The  State  then  appealed  the  denial  of the \nmotion  to  stay  to  the  Fifth  Circuit. \nOn  appeal,  a  Fifth  Circuit  panel  considered  the  limited  issue  of whether the  portion  of the  injunction \naddressing  the  scholarship  monies  should  be  stayed  pending  appeal  Over  Judge  James  L. \nDennis'  dissent,  the  panel  determined  that  the  motion  to  stay  should  be  granted  because  the  State \nhad  shown a  likelihood  of success  on  the  merits  of  its  arguments  that  there  is  a  lack of  jurisdiction \nunder the  Eleventh  Amendment,  the  district  court  should  have  abstained  under \nthe  Pullman  Doctrine,  and/or there  was  a  lack  of  evidence  whether the  district  court  had  authority  to \nact  under the  All  Writs  Act. \nWhile  the  Eleventh  Amendment  analysis  is  inapplicable  to  this  case,  the  Court  has  considered  the \nremainder  of the  panel's  analysis.  The  Moore  panel  determined  that  the  State  had  shown  a \nlikelihood  of success  on  the  merits  of  its  argument  that  the  district  court  lacked  jurisdiction  under  the \nAll  Writs  Act  because  the  Tangipahoa  Parish  School  Board  and  the  individual  plaintiffs  had \nalternative  means  of  seeking  relief from  the  Louisiana  Legislature  in  the  form  of additional  funding  or \nrepeal  of the  Program,  or  they  could  have  availed  themselves  of  relief  in  state  court.  /d.  at  *6.  The \nFifth  Circuit  took  note  that  \"proceedings  in  the  state  court  already  suggest  that  alternative  relief \nwould  be  available  in  light  of  a  recent  decision  from a  state  district  court  holding  that  the  Program's \ndisbursement  of education  funds  to  private  institutions  violates  Louisiana's  state \nconstitution.\"  /d.  (citing  La.  Fed'n  of  Teachers  v.  Louisiana,  No.  612,733,  slip  op.  at  2  (19th  La.  Dist. \nNov.  30,  2012)). \nThe  Fifth  Circuit  panel  further  concluded  that  the  State  has  a  \"strong  argument\"  that  Tangipahoa \nSchool  Board  and  the  individual  plaintiffs  have  not  established  their  \"clear  and  indisputable\"  right  to\nthe  writ.  The  plaintiffs  had  argued  that  the  loss  of funding  to  the  district  because  of the  Program \nwould  adversely  affect  the  ability  of the  Tangipahoa  Parish  School  Board  to  comply  with  the  consent \ndecree,  but  presented  only  general  financial  data  and  budgets  and  a  few  specific  budget  needs \nunrelated  to  schools  affected  by  the  Program.  The  Fifth  Circuit  concluded  that  the  evidence \npresented  was  speculative  and  failed  to  demonstrate  immediate  irreparable  harm  warranting  relief. \nFinally,  the  Fifth  Circuit  panel  concluded  that  the  State  has  made  a  strong  showing  588*588that  it  is \nlikely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of the  argument  that  the  district  court's  reliance  on  the  All  Writs  Act \nwas  not  appropriate  based  on  the  circumstances.  See  id.  at  *7-8.  The  panel  noted  that  a  decision  by \nthe  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  on  the  pending  state  court  action  that  the  Program  is  unconstitutional \nwould  \"render  this  federal  action  moot.\"  /d.  at  *8. \nWhile  Moore  is  instructive,  the  facts  and  circumstances  of this  case  stand  in  stark  contrast  to  it. \nUnlike  the  Moore  plaintiffs,  the  DOJ  can  meet  its  burden  as  to  the  first  element  because  it  does  not \nhave  alternative  means  of obtaining  the  remedy  it  seeks.  The  DOJ  cannot  seek  relief from  the \nLouisiana  Legislature,  nor would  its  participation  in  the  state  court  action,  even  if appropriate, \nprovide  the  remedy  it  seeks.  Further,  the  DOJ  has  obtained  all  information  available  to  it  through \nthe  School  Board  and  through  public  sources.  The  DOJ  made  an  appropriate  request  to  the  LDOE, \nbut  was  denied  the  discovery  responses  based  on  FERPA! \nWith  regard  to  the  second  element,  the  DOu's  right  to  issuance  of the  writ  is  clear  and  indisputable. \nFor  more  than  forty  years,  the  DOJ  and  the  Court  have  monitored  and  reviewed  the  actions  of the \nSchool  Board  to  remedy  the  vestiges  of  racial  discrimination.  Further,  the  1984  Consent  Order  and \nthe  2012  Superseding  Consent  Order  imposed  obligations  on  the  School  Board,  pursuant  to  Title  VI \nof the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000c,  eft  seq.,  and  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  The  DOJ  has  a  corresponding  duty  to \nmonitor  the  School  Board's  desegregation  efforts  under the  original  and  modified  orders. \nAdditionally,  the  DOJ  was  specifically  charged  by  the  Court  in  December  2009  with  conducting  a \nunitary  status  review,  which  includes  a  review  of the  Green  factor!  of  student  assignment  in  the \nDistrict.  All  589*589  parties  are  currently  working  with  the  Court  to  finally  resolve  this  long-standing \ncase.  However,  neither  the  DOJ  nor this  Court  can  fully  evaluate  the  current  state  of desegregation \nin  the  District  and  student  assignment  without  considering  the  effect  of students  leaving  the  system \nto  take  part  in  the  Program.  The  LDOE  is  the  only  entity  with  all  the  information  necessary  for that \nevaluation. \nFinally,  with  regard  to  the  third  element,  the  Court  finds  that  the  granting  of the  motion  is  appropriate \nunder the  circumstances.  The  DOJ's  discovery  request  is  not  \"entangled  in  a  skein  of  state  law  that \nmust  be  untangled  before  the  federal  case  can  proceed[.]\"  Moore,2013  WL  141791  at  *6  (alteration \n  \nin  original)  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  The  DOJ  does  not  seek  to  enjoin  the \nLDOE  from  taking  any  action  or to  enjoin  the  application  of the  Program  itself;  rather,  the  DOJ  seeks \nonly  to  obtain  information  and  documents  necessary  to  evaluate  the  Program's  effect  on  the  on- \ngoing  desegregation  case. \nThe  Court  must  also  consider,  however,  whether  it  should  abstain  from  ruling  on  the  motion  at  this \ntime. \nB.  The  Pullman  Doctrine \n\"A  federal  court  should  generally  abstain  from  exercising  jurisdiction  in  a  matter when  an  unsettled \narea  of the  law  has  an  effect  on  the  outcome  of a  federal  constitutional  claim  or would  render  a \ndecision  on  the  federal  issue  unnecessary.\"  /d.  at  *5  (citing  R.R.  Comm'n  v.  Pullman  Co.,  312  U.S. \n \n496,  61  S.Ct.  643,  85  L.Ed.  971  (1941)  (other  citation  omitted)).  In  Moore,  the  Fifth  Circuit  panel \ndetermined  that  a  decision  by  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  in  the  pending  state  action  that  the \nProgram  is  unconstitutional  would  render  the  federal  action  enjoining  the  application  of the  Program \nmoot. \nIn  this  case,  however,  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court's  decision  on  the  pending  state  court  action \nwould  not  moot  the  DOJ's  motion,  through  which  it  seeks  discovery,  not  injunctive  relief.  Regardless \nof the  ultimate  decision  on  the  constitutionality  of the  Program,  the  DOJ  must  obtain  the  information \nand  documents  necessary  to  determine  the  current  effect  the  program  is  having  in  a  pending \ndesegregation  case.  Thus,  the  Court  finds  that  abstention  is  not  appropriate  in  this  case. \nC.  FERPA  and  Other  Considerations \nAlthough  the  Court  has  determined  that  action  is  appropriate  under the  All  Writs  Act,  the  LDOE \nargues  against  the  release  of the  requested  discovery  because  (1)  the  release  violates  FERPA;  (2) \nthe  requested  discovery  is  irrelevant  to  its  stated  purpose;  and  (3)  the  requested  discovery  has  been \nprovided  or  is  readily  available  to  the  public.  The  Court  rejects  these  arguments. \n1.  FERPA  Law  Enforcement  Exception \nUnder  FERPA,  federal  education  funds  will  not  be  made  available  to  \"any  educational  agency  or \ninstitution  which  has a  policy  or  practice  of  permitting  the  release  of  education  records  (or  personally \nidentifiable  information  contained  therein  other  than  directory  information  ...  of students  without  the \nwritten  consent  of their  parents  to  any  individual,  agency,  or  organization,\"  other than  under  certain \nrecognized  exceptions.  20  U.S.C.  ยง  1232g(b)(1).  There  is  no  dispute  that  the  DOJ  seeks  discovery, \nat  least  in  part,  of  \"education  records\"  or  records  which  would  contain  \"personally  identifiable \ninformation\"  under  FERPA.  At  issue  is  whether the  requested  discovery  may  be  released  to  the  DOJ \nas  \"authorized  representatives  of the  Attorney  590*590  General  for  law  enforcement  purposes....\"  20 \nU.S.C.  ยง  1232g(b)(1)(C)(ii).4 \nIn  United  States  v.  Bertie  Cty.  Bd.  of Educ.,  319  F.Supp.2d  669  (E.D.N.C.2004),  the  district  court \nwas  presented  with  the  same  issue.  The  DOJ  sought  discovery  from  the  county  school  board,  which \nwas  a  party  to  the  case.  The  county  school  board  was  not  opposed  to  releasing  the  information,  but \nwas  concerned  that  it  was  prohibited  from  doing  so  by  FERPA.  Finding  no  definition  of  \"law \nenforcement\"  in  FERPA,  the  district  court  turned  to  the  definition  found  in  Black's  Law  Dictionary: \nโThe  detection  and  punishment  of violations  of the  law.  This  term  is  not  limited  to  the  enforcement  of \ncriminal  laws.  For  example,  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  contains  an  exemption  from  disclosure \nfor  information  compiled  for  law-enforcement  purposes  and  furnished  in  confidence.  That  exemption \nis  valid  for  the  enforcement  of  a  variety  of  non  criminal  laws  (such  as  national-security  laws)  as  well \nas  Criminal  laws....\" \nId.  at  671  (quoting  BLACK'S  LAW  DICTIONARY  891  (7th  ed.  1999)  (citation  omitted)).  The  district \ncourt  also  looked  at  cases  interpreting  the  term  law  enforcement  under  FOIA,  5  U.S.C.  ยง  552,  and \nfound  that  courts  have  consistently  held  that  the  term  encompasses  the  enforcement  of  both  criminal \nand  civil  statutes.  /d.  (collecting  cases). \nUltimately,  the  Bertie  court  concluded  that  the  law  enforcement  exception  applied  to  the  United \nStates'  discovery  requests  because  the  desegregation  case  had  been  filed  under  Section  407  of the \nCivil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000c-6(a)  and  (b)  to  enforce  the  Civil  Rights  Act  and  achieve  ยง\n2000c-6(2)'s  goal  of desegregation.  The  United  States  was  seeking  the  records  to  demonstrate  that \nthe  school  board  was  still  in  violation  of the  provision  and  to  enforce  compliance  with  the  Act.  See \ngenerally Lopez  v.  Metro.  Gov't  of Nashville  and  Davidson  Cty.,  594  F.Supp.2d  862,  867 \n(M.D.Tenn.2009)  (Considering  Bertie  and  finding  that  the  DOJ  was  entitled  to  obtain  documentation \nof  allegations  of  sexual  abuse  on  school  buses  from  the  city  and  county  government  under  the  law \nenforcement  exception  to  a  state  confidentiality  statute  because  \"it  would  be  anomalous  to  charge \nthe  United  States  with  enforcement  of Title  IX  but,  at  the  same  time,  preclude  it  from  obtaining \ninformation  relevant  to  its  enforcement  responsibilities.\"). \nThe  Court  agrees  with  and  adopts  the  analysis  of the  Bertie  court.  Applying  that  analysis,  the  Court \nfinds  that  the  law  enforcement  exception  to  FERPA  is  applicable  to  the  DOJ  in  this  case  based  on  its \ncontinuing  duty  to  monitor  the  School  Board's  desegregation  efforts  and  to  complete  a  unitary  status \nreview.  The  information  and  documentation  that  the  DOJ  seek  from  the  LDOE  are  directly  related  to \nthese  duties.โAccordingly,  the  Court  finds  that  the  LDOE  can  release  the \nrequested  591*591  information  and  documentation  to  the  DOJ  without  violating  FERPA. \n2.  Other  Considerations \nThe  LDOE's  remaining  objections  are  that  the  requested  discovery  is  irrelevant  to  its  stated  purpose \nand  that  the  discovery  has  been  provided  or  is  available  through  public  sources.  The  Court  rejects \nthese  arguments.  First,  with  regard  to  relevancy,  the  DOJ  has  voluntarily  withdrawn  Interrogatories \nNos.  6  and  7,  to  which  the  LDOE  objected,  at  this  time  to  facilitate  resolution  of this  motion.  Second, \nthe  DOJ  has  not  been  able  to  acquire  the  requested  discovery,  even  with  the  assistance  of the \nCourt,  from  public  sources.  Thus,  neither  of the  remaining  considerations  raised  by  the  LDOE  are \nsufficient  to  support  denial  of the  DOJ's  motion. \nIll.  CONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  DOJ's  Motion  for  Relief  Under  the  All  Writs  Act  is  GRANTED  IN \nPART  and  DENIED  IN  PART  as  MOOT.  The  Court  finds  that  it  has  jurisdiction  under  the  All  Writs \nAct  to  order  relief and  further finds  that  the  DOJ  is  entitled  to  release  of the  information  and \ndocuments  requested  in  Interrogatories  Nos.  1-5  and  8  and  Request  for  Production  No.  1  under the \nlaw  enforcement  exception  to  FERPA.  To  this  extent,  the  DOJ's  motion  is  GRANTED.  The  LDOE \nshall  provide  the  requested  discovery  not  already  provided  to  the  DOJ  by  March  1,  2013.  The  DOJ \norally  informed  the  Court  that  it  withdraws  Interrogatories  Nos.  6  and  7.  Thus,  the  motion  is  DENIED \nAS  MOOT  as  to  Interrogatories  Nos.  6  and  7,  subject  to  the  DOuJ's  right  to  re-propound  the \ninterrogatories  at  a  later  date. \n[1] Since  the  motion was filed,  the  DOJ  was  able to  obtain  some  information  from  the  School  Board,  but that information \ndoes  not moot the  DOJ's  motion. \n[2] Alma J.  Brown  Elementary School,  Grambling  Middle  School,  and  Grambling  High  School  are  all  associated with \nGrambling  State  University and  are  racially  identifiable  as  black schools.  A.E.  Phillips School  is  associated  with  Louisiana \nTech  University and  is  racially  identifiable  as  a white  school.  While  these  laboratory schools  are  physically  located  in  Lincoln \nParish,  they may draw students from  the  entire  state,  not just  Lincoln  Parish. \n[8] The  State  did  not move to  stay Judge  Lemelle's decision  on  the  portions  of the Act pertaining  to teacher accountability \nand  tenure. \n[4] The  DOJ  is  not challenging  the  constitutionality of the  Program  at this time.  Even  if possible,  it  is  neither practical  nor \nreasonable  of the  DOJ  to join  a  state  court  lawsuit merely to  obtain  information.\n[5] On  January 30,  2013,  Magistrate  Judge Wilkinson  in  the  Eastern  District of Louisiana  issued  an  order in  Brumfield v. \n Dodd,  405  F.Supp.  338  (E.D.La.1975).  The  Brumfield court previously  held  that it was  \"unconstitutional  for the  State  of \nLouisiana to  provide  assistance  to  private,  racially segregated  schools  in  the form  of textbooks,  classroom  materials and \nfinancial  assistance for transportation.\"  /d.  (June  10,  1985  Consent  Decree).  The  United  States  of America  obtained \ninjunctive  relief against the  State,  and  the  June  10,  1985  Consent  Decree  provided for continuing  compliance with  and \nenforcement of the  Decree.  In  his January 30,  2013  Order,  Magistrate Judge Wilkinson  granted  the  motion  of the  United \nStates  of America,  through  the  Civil  Rights  Division  of the  DOJ,  to  compel  discovery  responses  relevant to whether the \neducational  benefits  under the  Program  comply with  the  Brumfield orders  and  consent decree.  Magistrate Judge Wilkinson \nordered  that the  LDOE  provide  discovery  responses  on  the  limited  issue  by  March  1,  2013.  However,  Magistrate Judge \nWilkinson  did  not decide  the  issue  of the  application  of the  FERPA exception,  finding  that his  order would  supersede  the \nLDOE's objection,  and  his  order is  limited  to the  Brumfield issue.  Id.  (January 30,  2013  Order,  at p.  6).  The  LDOE  has since \nasked for reconsideration  of this order,  asserting  that it had  not received  timely notice  of the  motion,  so  that it could  respond. \n[6]  Under  Green  v.  Cty.  Sch.  Bd.  of New Kent Cty.,  Va.,  391  U.S.  430,  88  S.Ct.  1689,  20  L.Ed.2d  716  (1968),  in  determining \nwhether a  school  board  has  eliminated  the  effects of prior discrimination  to  the  extent practicable,  the  district court considers \nthe following  factors:  (1) faculty and  staff assignments,  (2) transportation,  (3)  extra-curricular activities,  (4) facilities,  (5) \nstudent assignments,  and  (6)  curriculum.  /d.  at 435,  88  S.Ct.  1689. \n[7] The  LDOE  concedes that if the  DOJ  issued  a  subpoena,  or this  Court issued  an  order,  the  LDOE  could  be  required  to \nrelease the  requested  discovery  pursuant to 20  U.S.C.  ยง  1232g(b)(2).  That  provision  of FERPA,  however,  requires  notice  to \nparents  and would further and  unnecessarily delay the  release.  The  Court also finds that it  is  necessary to  address the  law \nenforcement exception  in  the  interest of judicial  economy  because the  DOJ  intends to  request the  same type  of discovery  in \nother pending  desegregation  cases,  and  the  Court can  only assume that the  LDOE will  continue to  assert the  same \nargument. \n[8] At first blush,  it might appear that the  DOJ's  Request for  Production  No.  1  is  not related  to the  DOJ's duty  in  this  case \nbecause  the  DOJ  seeks \"copies  of all  signed  waivers  submitted  by  parents  on  behalf of disabilities who  reside  in  Lincoln \nParish who  applied  to  the  program.\"  [Doc.  No.  62,  Exh.  A].  However,  in  order to  adequately compare  all facets  of the  schools \nin  Lincoln  Parish,  the  Court and  the  DOJ  need  to  know  if the  schools  in  the  Program  are  providing  services for disabled \nstudents.\n",

JAMES\nLINCOLN PARISH SCHOOL BOARD,  MAG. JUDGE KAREN L. HAYES\nET AL.\nRULING\nPending before the Court is a Motion for Relief under the All Writs Act [Doc. No. 62] filed\nby the United States of America, Department of Justice (โDOJโ).  DOJ has moved the Court under\nthe All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง1651, to compel a non-party, the Louisiana Department of Education\n(โLDOEโ), to provide responses to interrogatories and requests for production related to the Stateโs\nprivate school scholarship program.1  On January 18, 2013, the LDOE filed a memorandum in\nopposition [Doc. No. 66] to the DOJโs motion.  \nFor the following reasons, the DOJโs motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN\nPART as MOOT, and the LDOE is hereby ORDERED to provide responses to Interrogatories Nos.\n1-5 and 8 and Request for Production No. 1, to the extent not already provided, no later than March\n1, 2013.  The motion is DENIED as MOOT as to Interrogatories Nos. 6 and 7, subject to the right\nof the DOJ to re-propound these interrogatories at a later date.  \nI.  BACKGROUND AND PERTINENT FACTS\nThe desegregation case has been pending since June 8, 1966.  The original consent decree\nwas entered by the Honorable Ben C. Dawkins, Jr., on August 1, 1969.  Under the decree, the\n1Since the motion was filed, the DOJ was able to obtain some information from the\nSchool Board, but that information does not moot the DOJโs motion. \n\nLincoln Parish School Board (โSchool Boardโ) agreed to take the following remedial measures:\n(1)  Allowing student transfers in only the following situations: \nA.  When a student in the majority race at his school transfers to a school\nwhere he will be in the minority race;\nB.  When a student requires a course of study not offered at the school to\nwhich he has been assigned and transfers to a school which offers\ncourses for his special needs;\nC.  When a student is physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or\ngifted and transfers schools or classes because another school or class\nwill be better equipped to accommodate him;  \nD.  All transfers must be granted on a non-discriminatory basis and may\nnot reduce desegregation or reinforce the dual school system.  \n(2)  Forbidding segregation or discrimination on account of race or color in any\nservice, facility, activity, or program, including transportation, athletics, and\nother extracurricular activities, conducted or sponsored by the school. \n(3)  Equalizing schools formerly maintained for African-Americans and creating\nremedial programs for students who previously attended segregated schools\nto overcome past inadequacies in their education.\n(4)  Conducting all school construction, school consolidation, and site selection\nso as to eliminate the existence of the dual school system and its recurrence.\n(5)  Desegregating faculty and staff  and employing all principals, teachers,\nteacher-aides, and staff on a nondiscriminatory basis.\n(6)  Requiring the Lincoln Parish School Board to file an annual report, tracking\nthe racial makeup of employees and students at each school, as well as filing\na report when construction plans were submitted to the school board.         \nThe decree has been modified several times through the years to permit the implementation\nof a majority-to-minority transfer policy, to provide for the examination of the transportation system,\nto create a bi-racial committee, to consolidate schools, to modify reporting requirements, and to\n2\n\nchange attendance zones.\nSince 1984, the Court has considered actions necessary to address the two laboratory schools\nlocated in Lincoln Parish: the Grambling laboratory school (Alma J. Brown Elementary, Grambling\nMiddle School, and Grambling High School) and the A.E. Phillips Laboratory School.2  On October\n8, 1984, the Honorable Thomas E. Stagg, Jr., issued a consent decree which set forth a plan to\ndesegregate the two schools.    \nFor more than forty years, the School Board has provided statistical reports to the Court,\nrequested authorization for any actions which could affect desegregation, and the DOJ has monitored\nthe School Boardโs desegregation efforts.  In late 2009, the Court began meeting with the parties in\nall active desegregation cases in the Monroe Division to determine the actions necessary for the\ndistricts to obtain unitary status and for the cases to be finally resolved.  Consistent with that goal,\non December 14, 2009, the Court held a status conference with the parties in this case and, acting\nsua sponte, ordered the DOJ to conduct a unitary status review of the District.  See [Doc. No. 8]. \nSince that time, the Court, the School Board, the DOJ, and the laboratory schools have been engaged\nin on-going efforts to resolve the remaining desegregation issues.  Nevertheless, as of this date, the \ncase remains open and active.\nIn April 2012, during the Regular Session, the Louisiana Legislature enacted legislation\nknown as the  Student Scholarships for Educational Excellence Act, implemented through Act No.\n2Alma J. Brown Elementary School, Grambling Middle School, and Grambling High\nSchool are all associated with Grambling State University and are racially identifiable as black\nschools.  A.E. Phillips School is associated with Louisiana Tech University and is racially\nidentifiable as a white school.  While these laboratory schools are physically located in Lincoln\nParish, they may draw students from the entire state, not just Lincoln Parish.  \n3\n\n2.  See LA. REV. STAT. ANN. ยงยง 17:4011-4025.  The state scholarship program (โthe Programโ)\nallows students in Louisiana parishes who (1) have family incomes below 250% of the poverty line\nand (2) are enrolled in a school that received a grade of โCโ or lower on LDOEโs accountability scale\nto attend participating private schools or certain high-performing public schools.  See LA.REV.STAT.\nANN. ยงยง 17:4013,:4018.  For any student who participates in the Program, Minimum Foundation\nProgram (โMFPโ) funds, state funds intended for public education, follow the student to the new\nschool. See id. ยง 17:4016.\nOn May 24, 2012, the Court approved the Superseding Consent Order [Doc. No. 55] in this\ncase, requiring the School Board to take additional actions to comply with its student assignment\nobligations, as well as retaining its duty to eliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation.   \nIn Lincoln Parish, there are thirteen schools which received a grade of โCโ or lower:\nChoudrant Elementary School, Cypress Springs Elementary School, Dubach High School, Glen\nView Elementary School, Hico Elementary School, Howard School, I.A. Lewis School, Ruston\nElementary School, Ruston Junior High School, Simsboro High School, Alma J. Brown Elementary\nSchool, Grambling Middle School, and Grambling High School.   Any student who attends these\nschools and whose family meets the income requirement is eligible to participate in the Program.  \n   Prior to filing its motion, the DOJ requested information and documentation from the LDOE\nrelated to the Lincoln Parish students who applied for and/or are participating in the Program, as well\nas information on the schools participating in the Program.  The LDOE refused to provide the\ninformation, citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (โFERPAโ), 20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g. \nThe LDOE contends that release of the information and documentation without a subpoena or court\norder would potentially violate FERPA and jeopardize its federal education funding.  \n4\n\nAfter its unsuccessful attempt to obtain the information from the LDOE, the DOJ filed the\ninstant Motion for Relief Under the All Writs Act. [Doc. No. 62].  The DOJ attached its\ninterrogatories and request for production to the motion.  The LDOE filed a memorandum in\nopposition to the motion. [Doc. No. 66].\nAfter filing the motion, with the Courtโs assistance, the DOJ was able to obtain some\ninformation from the School Board, which had been provided to the School Board by the LDOE. \nThis information was not fully responsive, however, to the DOJโs discovery requests.  Therefore, the\nDOJ continued to pursue its motion.  \nOn January 30, 2013, in a joint conference with the Courtโs law clerk, the DOJ and the LDOE\nreported that they had met and discussed the pending motion.  In order to resolve the motion, the  \nDOJ agreed to withdraw its Interrogatories Nos. 6 and 7, to which the LDOE raised relevancy\nobjections, subject to the DOJโs right to re-propound those interrogatories at a later date.  In response\nto the DOJโs Interrogatory No. 8 requesting funding information on the Program, the LDOE had\nprovided a deposition used in another recent case.  With regard to the remaining interrogatories and\nrequest for production, the LDOE still contends that the release of the information and documents\nis prohibited by FERPA and that it cannot act without a subpoena or court order.  \nSubject to the agreements set forth above, the DOJโs motion remains pending before the\nCourt.     \nII.  ALL WRITS ACT\nThe All Writs Act provides โpower [to] a federal court to issue such commands . . . as may\nbe necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it has previously issued\nin its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained.โ United States v. N.Y. Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172\n5\n\n(1977); see also 28 U.S.C. ยง 1651(a).  This power extends to non-parties โwhen their conduct\nfrustrates the courtโs order.โ  Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish Sch. Bd., No. 12-31218, 2013 WL\n141791, at *6 (5th  Cir. Jan. 13, 2013) (citing N.Y. Tel., 434 U.S. at 174).  For a district court to act,\nthree elements must be satisfied.  โFirst, โthe party seeking issuance of the writ [must] have no other\nadequate means to attain the relief he desires.โโ  Id. (quoting  Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C.,\n542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004) (alteration in original)).  โWhen alternative means of relief are available,\nthe court should not issue a writ.โ  Id.  โSecond, the party seeking the writ must meet its โburden of\nshowing that [its] right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.โโ Id. at *6-7 (quoting\nCheney, 542 U.S. at 381 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).  โThird, assuming the\npetition meets the first two requirements, a court should exercise discretion before issuing a writ to\nensure it โis appropriate under the circumstances.โโ Id. at *7 (quoting Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381)\n(citation omitted)).\nIn  this  case,  the  DOJ  contends  that  the  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  on-going\ndesegregation case, that it is entitled to obtain the requested information and documents from the\nLDOE as part of its duties in this case, and that it is unable to obtain the information and documents\nbecause of the LDOEโs FERPA assertion.  In response, the LDOE contends that the Court lacks\njurisdiction to consider the All Writs Motion or should abstain under the Pullman doctrine based on\nthe Fifth Circuitโs recent decision in Moore.  Alternatively, the LDOE contends that the Court should\ndeny the DOJโs motions because (1) the release of the information would violate FERPA, which\nwould threaten federal funding for the State; (2) the information sought is irrelevant to its stated\npurpose; and (3) the information has been provided or is readily available to the public.  \n6\n\nA. Jurisdiction\nFirst, the Court must consider the jurisdictional question, which was recently addressed in\nan unpublished Fifth Circuit decision.  In Moore, the desegregation plaintiffs and the Tangipahoa\nSchool Board filed an All Writs motion, seeking injunctions against the LDOE to stop the further\nimplementation of certain provisions of Act 1 and 2 of the 2012 Regular Session of the Louisiana\nLegislature, including the Program.  Following a November 26, 2012 hearing, the Honorable Judge\nIvan Lemelle granted the motion.  On November 28, 2012, Judge Lemelle entered an order \nenjoining the provisions of Acts 1 and 2, including the Program, in Tangipahoa Parish.  The\nfollowing day, Judge Lemelle denied the Stateโs request for a stay.  The State then appealed the\ndenial of the motion to stay to the Fifth Circuit.  \nOn appeal, a Fifth Circuit panel considered the limited issue of whether the portion of the\ninjunction addressing the scholarship monies should be stayed pending appeal.3  Over Judge James\nL. Dennisโ dissent, the panel determined that the motion to stay should be granted because the State\nhad shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its arguments that there is a lack of jurisdiction\nunder the Eleventh Amendment, the district court should have abstained under the Pullman Doctrine,\nand/or there was a lack of evidence whether the district court had authority to act under the All Writs\nAct. \nWhile the Eleventh Amendment analysis is inapplicable to this case, the Court has considered\nthe remainder of the panelโs analysis.  The Moore panel determined that the State had shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of its argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction under\n3The State did not move to stay Judge Lemelleโs decision on the portions of the Act\npertaining to teacher accountability and tenure.  \n7\n\nthe All Writs Act because the Tangipahoa Parish School Board and the individual plaintiffs had\nalternative means of seeking relief from the Louisiana Legislature in the form of additional funding\nor repeal of the Program, or they could have availed themselves of relief in state court.  Id. at *6. \nThe Fifth Circuit took note that โproceedings in the state court already suggest that alternative relief\nwould be available in light of a recent decision from a state district court holding that the Programโs\ndisbursement of education funds to private institutions violates Louisianaโs state constitution.โ  Id.\n(citing La. Fedโn of Teachers v. Louisiana, No. 612,733, slip op. at 2 (19th La. Dist. Nov. 30, 2012)). \nThe Fifth Circuit panel further concluded that the State has a โstrong argumentโ that\nTanigpahoa School Board and the individual plaintiffs have not established their โclear and\nindisputableโ right to the writ.  The plaintiffs had argued that the loss of funding to the district\nbecause of the Program would adversely affect the ability of the Tangipahoa Parish School Board\nto comply with the consent decree, but presented only general financial data and budgets and a few\nspecific budget needs unrelated to schools affected by the Program.  The Fifth Circuit concluded that\nthe evidence presented was speculative and failed to demonstrate immediate irreparable harm\nwarranting relief. \nFinally, the Fifth Circuit panel concluded that the State has made a strong showing that it is\nlikely to succeed on the merits of the argument that the district courtโs reliance on the All Writs Act\nwas not appropriate based on the circumstances.  See id. at *7-8.   The panel noted that a decision\nby  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  on  the  pending  state  court  action  that  the  Program  is\nunconstitutional would โrender this federal action moot.โ  Id. at *8. \nWhile Moore is instructive, the facts and circumstances of this case stand in stark contrast\nto it.  Unlike the Moore plaintiffs, the DOJ can meet its burden as to the first element because it does\n8\n\nnot have alternative means of obtaining the remedy it seeks.  The DOJ cannot seek relief from the\nLouisiana Legislature, nor would its participation in the state court action, even if appropriate,\nprovide the remedy it seeks.4  Further, the DOJ has obtained all information available to it through\nthe School Board and through public sources.  The DOJ made an appropriate request to the LDOE,\nbut was denied the discovery responses based on FERPA.5  \nWith regard to the second element, the DOJโs right to issuance of the writ is clear and\nindisputable.  For more than forty years, the DOJ and the Court have monitored and reviewed the\nactions of the School Board to remedy the vestiges of racial discrimination.  Further, the 1984\nConsent Order and the 2012 Superseding Consent Order imposed obligations on the School Board,\npursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000c, et seq., and the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The DOJ has a\n4The DOJ is not challenging the constitutionality of the Program at this time.  Even if\npossible, it is neither practical nor reasonable fo the DOJ to join a state court lawsuit merely to\nobtain information.  \n5On January 30, 2013, Magistrate Judge Wilkinson in the Eastern District of Louisiana\nissued an order in Brumfield v. Dodd, Civil Action No. 71-1316 (E.D. La. 1975).  The Brumfield\ncourt previously held that it was โunconstitutional for the State of Louisiana to provide assistance\nto private, racially segregated schools in the form of textbooks, classroom materials and financial\nassistance for transportation.โ  Id. (June 10, 1985 Consent Decree).  The United States of\nAmerica obtained injunctive relief against the State, and the June 10, 1985 Consent Decree\nprovided for continuing compliance with and enforcement of the Decree.  In his January 30, 2013\nOrder, Magistrate Judge Wilkinson granted the motion of the United States of America, through\nthe Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, to compel discovery responses relevant to whether the\neducational benefits under the Program comply with the Brumfield orders and consent decree. \nMagistrate Judge Wilkinson ordered that the LDOE provide discovery responses on the limited\nissue by March 1, 2013.  However, Magistrate Judge Wilkinson did not decide the issue of the\napplication of the FERPA exception, finding that his order would supersede the LDOEโs\nobjection, and his order is limited to the Brumfield issue.  Id. (January 30, 2013 Order, at p. 6). \nThe LDOE has since asked for reconsideration of this order, asserting that it had not received\ntimely notice of the motion, so that it could respond.   \n9\n\ncorresponding duty to monitor the School Boardโs desegregation efforts under the original and\nmodified orders.  Additionally, the DOJ was specifically charged by the Court in December 2009\nwith conducting a unitary status review, which includes a review of the Green factor6 of student\nassignment in the District.  All parties are currently working with the Court to finally resolve this\nlong-standing case.  However, neither the DOJ nor this Court can fully evaluate the current state of\ndesegregation in the District and student assignment without considering the effect of students\nleaving the system to take part in the Program.  The LDOE is the only entity with all the information\nnecessary for that evaluation.   \nFinally, with regard to the third element, the Court finds that the granting of the motion is\nappropriate under the circumstances.  The DOJโs discovery request is not โentangled in a skein of\nstate law that must be untangled before the federal case can proceed[.]โ Moore, 2013 WL 141791\nat *6 (alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The DOJ does not seek\nto enjoin the LDOE from taking any action or to enjoin the application of the Program itself; rather,\nthe DOJ seeks only to obtain information and documents necessary to evaluate the Programโs effect\non the on-going desegregation case.    \nThe Court must also consider, however, whether it should abstain from ruling on the motion\nat this time.\nB.  The Pullman Doctrine\nโA federal court should generally abstain from exercising jurisdiction in a matter when an\n6Under Green v. Cty. Sch. Bd. of New Kent Cty., Va., 391 U.S. 430 (1968), in determining\nwhether a school board has eliminated the effects of prior discrimination to the extent\npracticable, the district court considers the following factors: (1) faculty and staff assignments,\n(2) transportation, (3) extra-curricular activities, (4) facilities, (5) student assignments, and (6)\ncurriculum.  Id. at 435.\n10\n\nunsettled area of the law has an effect on the outcome of a federal constitutional claim or would\nrender a decision on the federal issue unnecessary.โ  Id. at *5 (citing R.R.

In Moore, the Fifth Circuit panel determined that a\ndecision  by  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  in  the  pending  state  action  that  the  Program  is\nunconstitutional would render the federal action enjoining the application of the Program moot. \nIn this case, however, the Louisiana Supreme Courtโs decision on the pending state court\naction would not moot the DOJโs motion, through which it seeks discovery, not injunctive relief. \nRegardless of the ultimate decision on the constitutionality of the Program, the DOJ must obtain the\ninformation and documents necessary to determine the current effect the program is having in a\npending desegregation case.  Thus, the Court finds that abstention is not appropriate in this case.\nC.  FERPA and Other Considerations\nAlthough the Court has determined that action is appropriate under the All Writs Act, the\nLDOE argues against the release of the requested discovery because (1) the release violates FERPA;\n(2) the requested discovery is irrelevant to its stated purpose; and (3) the requested discovery has\nbeen provided or is readily available to the public.  The Court rejects these arguments.\n1.  FERPA Law Enforcement Exception \nUnder FERPA, federal education funds will not be made available to โany educational agency\nor institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records (or\npersonally identifiable information contained therein other than directory information . . . of students\nwithout the written consent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization,โ other than\nunder certain recognized exceptions.  20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(b)(1).  There is no dispute that the DOJ\nseeks discovery, at least in part, of โeducation recordsโ or records which would contain โpersonally\n11\n\nidentifiable informationโ under FERPA.  At issue is whether the requested discovery may be released\nto the DOJ as โauthorized representatives of the Attorney General for law enforcement purposes .\n. . .โ  20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(b)(1)(C)(ii).7  \nIn United States v. Bertie Cty. Bd. Of Educ., 319 F. Supp.2d 669 (E.D. N.C. 2004), the\ndistrict court was presented with the same issue.  The DOJ sought discovery from the county school\nboard, which was a party to the case.  The county school board was not opposed to releasing the\ninformation, but was concerned that it was prohibited from doing so by FERPA.  Finding no\ndefinition of โlaw enforcementโ in FERPA, the district court turned to the definition found in \nBlackโs Law Dictionary:  \nโThe detection and punishment of violations of the law. This term is not limited to\nthe enforcement of criminal laws. For example, the Freedom of Information Act\ncontains an exemption from disclosure for information compiled for law-enforcement\npurposes and furnished in confidence. That exemption is valid for the enforcement\nof a variety of non criminal laws (such as national-security laws) as well as criminal\nlaws. . . . โ \nId. at 671 (quoting BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 891 (7th ed. 1999) (citation omitted)).  The district\ncourt also looked at cases interpreting the term law enforcement under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, and\nfound that courts have consistently held that the term encompasses the enforcement of both criminal\nand civil statutes.  Id. (collecting cases).  \nUltimately, the Bertie court concluded that the law enforcement exception applied to the\n7The LDOE concedes that if the DOJ issued a subpoena, or this Court issued an order, the\nLDOE could be required to release the requested discovery pursuant to 20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(b)(2). \nThat provision of FERPA, however, requires notice to parents and would further and\nunnecessarily delay the release.  The Court also finds that it is necessary to address the law\nenforcement exception in the interest of judicial economy because the DOJ intends to request the\nsame type of discovery in other pending desegregation cases, and the Court can only assume that\nthe LDOE will continue to assert the same argument.  \n12\n\nUnited Statesโ discovery requests because the desegregation case had been filed under Section 407\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000c-6(a) and (b) to enforce the Civil Rights Act and\nachieve ยง 2000c-6(2)โs goal of desegregation.  The United States was seeking the records to\ndemonstrate that the school board was still in violation of the provision and to enforce compliance\nwith the Act.  See generally Lopez v. Metro. Govโt. of Nashville and Davidson Cty., 594 F. Supp.2d\n862, 867 (M.D. Tenn. 2009) (Considering Bertie and finding that the DOJ was entitled to obtain\ndocumentation of allegations of sexual abuse on school buses from the city and county government\nunder the law enforcement exception to a state confidentiality statute because โit would be\nanomalous to charge the United States with enforcement of Title IX but, at the same time, preclude\nit from obtaining information relevant to its enforcement responsibilities.โ).    \nThe Court agrees with and adopts the analysis of the Bertie court.  Applying that analysis,\nthe Court finds that the law enforcement exception to FERPA is applicable to the DOJ in this case\nbased on its continuing duty to monitor the School Boardโs desegregation efforts and to complete\na unitary status review.  The information and documentation that the DOJ seek from the LDOE are\ndirectly related to these duties.8  Accordingly, the Court finds that the LDOE can release the\nrequested information and documentation to the DOJ without violating FERPA.\n2.  Other Considerations\nThe LDOEโs remaining objections are that the requested discovery is irrelevant to its stated\n8At first blush, it might appear that the DOJโs Request for Production No. 1 is not related\nto the DOJโs duty in this case because the DOJ seeks โcopies of all signed waivers submitted by\nparents on behalf of disabilities who reside in Lincoln Parish who applied to the program.โ [Doc.\nNo. 62, Exh. A].  However, in order to adequately compare all facets of the schools in Lincoln\nParish, the Court and the DOJ need to know if the schools in the Program are providing services\nfor disabled students.  \n13\n\npurpose and that the discovery has been provided or is available through public sources.  The Court\nrejects these arguments.  First, with regard to relevancy, the DOJ has voluntarily withdrawn\nInterrogatories Nos. 6 and 7, to which the LDOE objected, at this time to facilitate resolution of this\nmotion.  Second, the DOJ has not been able to acquire the requested discovery, even with the\nassistance of the Court, from public sources.  Thus, neither of the remaining considerations raised\nby the LDOE are sufficient to support denial of the DOJโs motion.     \nIII.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the DOJโs Motion for Relief Under the All Writs Act is\nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as MOOT.  The Court finds that it has jurisdiction\nunder the All Writs Act to order relief and further finds that the DOJ is entitled to release of the\ninformation and documents requested in Interrogatories Nos. 1-5 and 8 and Request for Production\nNo. 1 under the law enforcement exception to FERPA.  To this extent, the DOJโs motion is\nGRANTED.  The LDOE shall provide the requested discovery not already provided to the DOJ by\nMarch 1, 2013.  The DOJ orally informed the Court that it withdraws Interrogatories Nos. 6 and 7. \nThus, the motion is DENIED AS MOOT as to Interrogatories Nos. 6 and 7, subject to the DOJโs\nright to re-propound the interrogatories at a later date.  \nMONROE, LOUISIANA, this 7th day of February, 2013.\n14",

But good faith does not excuse a boardโs non-compliance \nwith its affirmative duty to liquidate the dual system. Good faith is relevant only as a necessary ingredient of an acceptable \n \ndesegregation plan.โ Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal Separate Sch. Dist., supra 409 F.2d at 684. \n \n8  Twenty-two of the school boards were ordered to integrate their school systems beginning with the 1965-66 school year. Two \nboards commenced with the 1964-65 school year. Nine began in 1966-67, and five did not begin until the 1967-68 school year. \n \n \n9  โWith every ounce of sincerity which we possess we think freedom of choice is the best plan available.

St. Helena Parish School Bd., 417 F.2d 801 (1969)   \n \n \n \n10  See the concurring opinion of Judge Rubin in Duval County: \nโGreen emphasizes that school officials have a continuing duty to take whatever action may be necessary to provide โprompt and \n \neffective disestablishment of a dual system.โ If one method is ineffective, they are to try another. Hence, no single plan is or can \nbe judicially approved as a catholicon. โBrown I and all of its successors, as well as Green, Monroe, and Raney, contemplate that \nschool plans will be prepared by local officials and school boards, not by courts. But if local officials fail to assume their \nresponsibilities under the Constitution, district courts must continue to attempt to formulate the plans that should be prepared \nby school officials based on their expert knowledge, training and skill.โ (Citations omitted.) \n402 F.2d at 908. \n \n11  See, e.g., the discussion of Whittenberg v. Greenville County School District, 298 F.Supp. 784 (D.C.S.C., March 31, 1969), at note \n14, infra, and accompanying text. \n \n \n12  But a plan which contributes toward preserving segregated schools by incorporating zones corresponding to racially separate \nresidential patterns is unacceptable. United States v. Indianola, supra. \n \n \n13  At least two district judges in Louisiana have ordered the use of the facilities of this center. Tangipahoa Parish, before us on this \nappeal, was ordered on October 15, 1968 to produce a plan for the 1969-70 school year for unitary operation of its school \n \nsystem. When the school board informed the court that it was unable to find a plan better than the one in existence, the court \nappointed the Center to prepare a plan. A hearing has not yet been held on whether the Centerโs plan will be adopted. \nIn Harris v. St. John the Baptist Parish Sch. Bd., Civ.No. 13212 (E.D.La. Apr. 23, 1969), the school board, after it did not come up \nwith a plan of its own, was ordered to consult with the Center. A hearing was set on the Centerโs plan. The board came in with \ntwo plans of its own. The district judge accepted one of the boardโs plans, which incorporated some of the Centerโs suggestions. \n \n14  The district court directed that all school districts submit to the Office of Education, HEW, their existing method of operation, \nalong with any changes proposed by them, and to seek to develop in conjunction with HEW an acceptable plan of operation \n \nโconformable to the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs * * * and consonant in timing and method with the practical and \nadministrative problems faced by the particular districts.โ If a plan is agreed upon by the school district and HEW, the South \nCarolina district court will approve it unless the plaintiffs show it does not meet constitutional standards. If the school district \nalready is operating under a plan approved by HEW, it will be adopted by the court absent a showing of constitutional infirmity. If \nno agreed plan is developed, the court will hold a hearing and enter its decree, considering the respective proposed plans of the \ndistrict, the plaintiffs, and HEW. \n \n15  The Supreme Court said: โThe general experience under โfreedom of choiceโ to date has been such as to indicate its \nineffectiveness as a tool of desegregation.โ 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1695, 20 L.Ed.2d at 725. \n \nSee also the opinion of District Judge Heebe in Moses v. Washington Parish School Board, 276 F.Supp. 834 at 851-852 \n(E.D.La.1967): \nโIf this Court must pick a method of assigning students to schools within a particular school district, barring very unusual \ncircumstances, we could imagine no method more inappropriate, more unreasonable, more needlessly wasteful in every respect, \nthan the socalled โfree-choiceโ system. \nโUnder such a system the school board cannot know in advance how many students will choose any school in the systemโ it \ncannot even begin to estimate the number. The first principle of pupil assignment in the scheme of school administration is thus \nthwarted; the principle ought to be to utilize all available classrooms and schools to accommodate the most favorable number of \nstudents; instead, this aim is surrendered in order to introduce an element of โlibertyโ (never before part of efficient school \nadministration) on the part of the students in the choice of their own school. Obviously there is no constitutional โrightโ for any \nstudent to attend the public school of his own choosing. But the extension of the privilege of choosing oneโs school, far from \nbeing a โrightโ of the students, is not even consistent with sound school administration. Rather, the creation of such a choice only \nhas the result of demoralizing the school system itself, and actually depriving every student of a good education. \nโUnder a โfree-choiceโ system, the school board cannot know or estimate the number of students who will want to attend any \nschool, or the identity of those who will eventually get their choice. Consequently, the board cannot make plans for the \ntransportation of students to schools, plan curricula, or even plan such things as lunch allotments and schedules; moreover, since \nin no case except by purest coincidence will an appropriate distribution of students result, and each school will have either more \nor less than the number it is designed to efficiently handle, many students at the end of the free-choice period have to be \nreassigned to schools other than those of their choiceโ this time on a strict geographical-proximity basis, see the Jefferson \n50 \n \n\n \n \nHall v. St. Helena Parish School Bd., 417 F.2d 801 (1969)   \n \n \nCounty decree, thus burdening the board, in the middle of what should be a period of firming up the system and making final \nadjustments, with the awesome task of determining which students will have to be transferred and which schools will receive \nthem. Until that final task is completed, neither the board nor any of the students can be sure of which school they will be \nattending; and many students will in the end be denied the very โfree choiceโ the system is supposed to provide them.โ (Emphasis \nin original.) \n \n16  See Davis v. Mobile County, supra, in which this court required a zone plan for urban areas but left freedom of choice in effect in \nrural areas. See also the dissenting opinion to the denial of en banc hearing in the instant cases, 406 F.2d at 1338-1339: โI am not \n \nsuggesting that freedom of choice should necessarily be abandoned in favor of zoning. * * * There is nothing necessarily \nunconstitutional about freedom of choice of geographic zoning or a combination of the two.โ \n \n1  Not available. This signal followed by dashes in adjoining columns means figures for all such columns are available \n \n \n2  The 1969-70 figures for all school systems, where shown, are based upon the incomplete results of the latest choice period \n(March 1, 1969 to April 1, 1969). They are not intended to be a completely accurate forecast of the racial make-up of the schools \n \ninvolved for 1969-70. At oral argument of these cases the parties were directed to furnish this information to the court to the \nextent possible, and in most instances they have done so. \n \n3  Figures given for faculty cross-overs for 1969-70 in all school systems, where shown, represent only the planned or tentative \nassignments as reported to the court by the school boards since oral argument. \n \n \n4  Fractions have been dropped from teacher cross-over figures, with no attempt to round off the figure. \n \n \n5  In a report filed in the district court February 27, 1967, a copy of which has been filed with this court pursuant to our oral order \nfor additional data, the Bossier Parish School Board states that it has set as a minimum goal for 1969-70 a 100% increase in \n \nfaculty integration. \n \n6  In this parish there are minor discrepancies between those figures collated by the appellants and those by the United States. The \ndifferences are nominal and do not impel a different conclusion on any issue in the case. We use appellantsโ figures. \n \n \n7  In a report filed in the district court on February 21, 1969 Caddo Parish states it has a goal of increasing faculty cross-over by 50% \nfor the 1969-70 school year. \n \n \n8  In its report to the district court in February, the East Carroll School Board states it has plans to increase faculty integration by \napproximately 100% in 1969-70. \n \n \n6  In this parish there are minor discrepancies between those figures collated by the appellants and those by the United States. The \ndifferences are nominal and do not impel a different conclusion on any issue in the case. We use appellantsโ figures. \n \n \n9  1967-68 reports of school board to the district court show that no teacher served full time in a Cross-over situation. 1968-69 \nreports do not distinguish between full and part-time teachers. \n \n \n10  Vermillion Parish has only one remaining school in which negroes are predominant. That school is all-Negro. \n \n \n11  Statistics on student integration in 1967-68 in Winn Parish appear to be derived from choice form reports to the district court \ndated September 8, 1967. They do not necessarily represent the number of students attending integrated schools during that \n \nyear. \n \n \n \n \n51 \n \n\n \n \nHall v.

JAMES\nv.\nGRAMBLING HIGH FOUNDATION, INC., \nGRAMBLING STATE UNIVERSITY, et al.,\nDefendants.\nMEMORANDUM ORDER\n  This is a long-standing desegregation case to which the United States of America (โthe\nUnited Statesโ), Louisiana State Superintendent of Education (โState Superintendentโ), Louisiana\nBoard of Elementary and Secondary Education (โBESEโ), University of Louisiana System (โULSโ),\nLouisiana Board of Regents (the โBoard of Regentsโ),1 Grambling State University (โGSUโ), and\nLouisiana Tech University (โLa. Techโ) remain parties.  \nIn August 2016, the Court authorized the operation of the formerly de jure segregated\nGrambling Laboratory Schools (โGrambling Lab Schoolsโ) as a K-12 charter school named Lincoln\nPreparatory School (โLincoln Prepโ) by the Grambling High Foundation, Inc. (โGHFโ).   GHF\nthereafter became, and remains, a party to this litigation.  The Courtโs authorization of the operation\nof Lincoln Prep was subject to certain conditions, including the condition that Lincoln Prep accept\nthe desegregation obligations of the Grambling Lab Schools and that the United States and GHF\nmeet in good faith to try to prepare a new consent order.  \n1Collectively, the Court will refer to these as the State Defendants.\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 2 of 19 PageID #:  8120\nA hearing was held in this matter on July 20, 2017, after the United States and GHF failed\nto reach an agreement on certain provisions of the proposed order.  During the hearing, GHF orally\nmoved for modification of those conditions of operation imposed in August 2016.  The United States\nopposed the motion and urged the Court to adopt the proposed order in its entirety.\n   Having reviewed the terms of the partiesโ joint proposals, as well as their objections and\nresponses, and considering the evidence presented at the hearing and the record in this matter, the\nCourt finds that the following Interim Order should be entered, superseding those parts of the July\n13, 1984 Consent Decree, to the extent applicable.  The Court further finds that this Interim Order\nis consistent with the objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\nfederal law and is reasonably calculated to desegregate the Grambling Lab Schools in their converted\nform as Lincoln Prep.  Therefore, \n  IT IS ORDERED that GHFโs oral motion [Doc. No. 279] is GRANTED IN PART and\nDENIED IN PART.\nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn June 8, 1966, the United States filed a complaint in this Court against Defendant Lincoln\nParish School Board (โLPSBโ), seeking to desegregate its de jure dual public school system.  [Doc.\nNo. 82-4].  On July 28, 1966, this Court entered a decree permanently enjoining LPSB from\noperating a racially segregated school system.  See [Doc. No. 82-5].  On August 1, 1969, the Court\nentered an order directing LPSB to โtake affirmative action to disestablish all school segregation and\nto eliminate the effects of the dual school systemโ and to adopt a desegregation plan.  [Doc. No.\n82-9].  That order was subsequently modified over the years and replaced by a Superseding Consent\nOrder entered by this Court on May 24, 2012.  See [Doc. Nos. 55, 82-10 & 82-11].  The 2012\n2\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 3 of 19 PageID #:  8121\nConsent Order was extended and modified by a Supplemental Court Order on June 1, 2015.  See\n[Doc. No. 151].  \nThese orders did not address the Grambling Lab Schools or the A.E. Phillips Laboratory\nSchool (โAEPโ), a public laboratory school located on the campus of La. Tech.  As a result of further\nlitigation, in 1980, this Court added the State Defendants, GSU (as operator of the Grambling Lab\nSchools), and La. Tech (as operator of AEP).  [Doc. Nos. 82-16, 82-17 & 82-20].  โThe state became\ninvolved in this action because the laboratory schools are run by the Louisiana State Board of\nEducation and the respective university officials.โ [Doc. No. 82-21].  โThe racial composition of\nthese two [lab] schools became an issue in the [LPSB] caseโ because of its role as a conduit for funds\nand materials to the lab schools, providing transportation to their students, and approving faculty\nselections.   Id. at p. 1.  \nOn July 13, 1984, the Court entered a Consent Decree, agreed upon and signed by the United\nStates, the State of Louisiana (the โStateโ), GSU, La. Tech, and LPSB.  The 1984 Consent Decree\nrequired GSU, La. Tech, and LPSB to take a number of actions intended to desegregate the\nlaboratory schools at the two universities.  [Doc. No. 82-3, pp. 4-24].\nFor many years, no action was taken in this case.  Upon its own motion on August 14, 2008,\nthe Court amended the 1970 Decree, reactivating this case and requiring LPSB to file an annual\nstatistical report.  [Doc. No. 2].  On December 14, 2009, this Court ordered the United States to\nconduct a unitary status review.  See [Doc. No. 8].  During the course of that review, the United\nStates identified continuing issues related to the desegregation of the lab schools, which it\nsummarized for the Court in its May 24, 2011 Status Report [Doc. No. 25].  \nOn May 13, 2013, the United States filed a Motion for Further Relief [Doc. No. 82] seeking\n3\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 4 of 19 PageID #:  8122\na new desegregation plan for the laboratory schools.  La. Tech and GSU opposed the United Statesโ\nmotion, and each university cross-filed for a declaration of unitary status [Doc. Nos. 97-98,\n104-105].  LPSB filed a motion to dismiss itself from the litigation regarding the lab school issues\n[Doc. No. 102].  Following briefing on the partiesโ various motions, the Court directed the parties\nto engage in negotiations to attempt to resolve the lab school issues.  See [Doc. No. 118, pp. 1-2].\nThe United States proposed options to desegregate the lab schools to GSU and the other\nDefendants on November 12, 2013.  See [Doc. No. 122].  On January 6, 2014, the United States met\nwith counsel for GSU and the other Defendants to further discuss the proposals to resolve the\noutstanding desegregation issues involving the lab schools.  See id. at p. 2.  The United States, GSU,\nand the other parties met with the Court on March 10, 2014, for further negotiations.  See [Doc. No.\n124, pp. 2-3].  During the conference, GSU informed the Court and the parties that, in partnership\nwith GSU and the City of Grambling, GHF had sought permission from LPSB to convert GSUโs lab\nschools to a Type 3 charter school and would seek permission from BESE for a Type 2 charter after\nreceiving LPSBโs rejection.   See id. at p. 2.\nOn August 12, 2015, GHF received conditional approval from BESE for a Type 2 charter\nschool, pending LDOE review.  After the State Superintendent confirmed that GHF met all standards\nfor approval, GSU filed an Amended Motion and Brief [Doc. Nos. 170, 170-1] on January 27, 2016. \nThe Amended Motion and Brief sought permission to convert the Grambling Lab Schools to a\ncharter school and to transfer control and governance of the charter school to GHF.  The United\nStates opposed GSUโs Amended Motion to the extent that it sought to operate the charter school\nwithout any obligations to desegregate and to eliminate the vestiges of the de jure segregation.  See\n[Doc. No. 200].\n4\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 5 of 19 PageID #:  8123\nOn April 20, 2016, the Court conducted a hearing regarding GSUโs Motion and Amended\nMotion [Doc. Nos. 157, 170].  See [Doc. No. 205].  On April 25, 2016, the Court issued a Ruling\nand Order granting GSUโs motion in part and denying it in part.  See [Doc. No. 211]; [Doc. No. 212]. \nThe Court granted GSUโs request to close the lab schools at the end of the 2015-2016 school year,\nbut denied GSUโs request to transfer control of the former Grambling Lab Schools to GHF without\ndesegregation obligations.  The Court granted the request โonly if GHF accepts the transfer subject\nto GSUโs desegregation obligations and under the other conditions detailed in this Ruling.โ  [Doc.\nNo. 211, pp. 8-9].  Those conditions included the following requirements: (i) GHF โwill enroll in\nthis matter immediatelyโ; (ii) GSU, โwhile no longer operating the Laboratory Schools, will remain\na party to this action to facilitate the transfer and to assist the Court with any issues that may arise\nwith the charter schoolโ; and (iii) GSU and GHF โwill work with the United States to develop a new\nconsent decree to replace the 1984 Consent Decree and to develop a plan which is reasonably\ncalculated to address the goals of desegregation and to allow the new charter school to obtain unitary\nstatus.โ [Doc. No. 211, p. 8].\nOn July 19, 2016, the Court granted GHFโs motion to intervene.   [Doc. No. 221].\nOn August 2, 2016, the parties participated in a settlement conference.  After the parties\nreached an impasse, GHF made an oral motion for authorization to open Lincoln Prep for the\n2016-2017 school year.  See [Doc. No. 230, p. 7].  The United States opposed the oral motion.  See\nid. at pp. 7-8.  After conducting an emergency hearing on August 2, the Court authorized GHF to\nbegin operating Lincoln Prep in the 2016-2017 school year, subject to several conditions: (i) Lincoln\nPrep โwill have a baseline of 370 studentsโ; (ii) GHF โwill file a letter of financial commitment for\nthe construction of new facilities no later than October 1, 2017โ; and (iii) GHF and the United States\n5\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 6 of 19 PageID #:  8124\nโwill file a proposed consent decree no later than September 6, 2016 . . . . [or] separate proposed\ndesegregation plans for the charter school with argument in support thereof.โ  Id. at p. 12.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS\nA school system that was previously segregated by law and has not yet achieved unitary\nstatus has the affirmative duty to eliminate all vestiges of past discrimination to the extent\npracticable.  See Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 485 (1992); Board of Educ. of Oklahoma City Pub.\nSch. Dist. No. 89 v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249-50 (1991); Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick, 443\nU.S. 449, 458-59 (1979); Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent County, Va., 391 U.S. 430, 437-38\n(1968)).  The affirmative duty to desegregate is a continuing responsibility, and โ[p]art of the\naffirmative duty . . . is the obligation not to take any action that would impede the progress of\ndisestablishing the dual system and its effects.โ  Dayton Bd. of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526,\n537-38 (1979).\nThe ultimate inquiry in determining whether a school system is unitary is whether it has (1)\nfully and satisfactorily complied in good faith with the courtโs desegregation orders for a reasonable\nperiod of time; (2) eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable; and\n(3) demonstrated a good faith commitment to the whole of the court's order and to those provisions\nof the law and the Constitution which were the predicate for judicial intervention in the first instance. \nSee Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 88-89 (1995); Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491-92; Dowell, 498 U.S.\nat 248-50 (1991).  The Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly referred to as the โGreen\nfactors,โ which must be addressed as part of the determination of whether a school district has\nfulfilled its duties and eliminated vestiges of the prior dual school system to the extent practicable. \nThese factors are (1) student assignment; (2) faculty; (3) staff; (4) transportation; (5) extracurricular\n6\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 7 of 19 PageID #:  8125\nactivities; and (6) facilities.  Green, 391 U.S. at 435-42.  The Green factors are not intended to be\na โrigid framework,โ as the Supreme Court has approved consideration of other indicia, such as\nโquality of education,โ in determining whether a school system has fulfilled its desegregation\nobligations.  See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.  Where racial disparities exist with respect to any of\nthese factors, the burden is on defendants to show that those disparities are not causally related to\nthe former dual system.  Id. at 494.\nWith respect to student assignment, a school is considered a โone-raceโ school where its\nstudent body is at least 90 percent black or white.  See Flax v. Potts, 915 F.2d 155, 161 n.8 (5th Cir.\n1990).  Federal courts have also considered schools to be racially identifiable where the percentage\nof students of one race deviates by more than 15-20 points from the system-wide average.  See, e.g.,\nBelk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 269 F.3d 305, 319 (4th Cir. 2001) (โ[P]lus/minus\nfifteen percent variance is clearly within accepted standards, and provides a reasonable starting point\nin the unitary status determination.โ); Williams v. Kimbrough, No. 65-11329, 2010 WL 1790516,\nat *5 n.4 (W.D. La. 2010) (unpublished) (using a 20-percent variance).     \nAs discussed below, the 1984 Consent Order has not resulted in the desegregation of the\nGrambling Lab Schools.  Therefore, additional relief is required.  \nIII. FACTS\nA. Operations and Funding \nHistorically  and  through  the  end  of  the  2015-2016  school  year,  GSUโs  College  of\nEducational, Professional, and Graduate Studies exercised direct day-to-day supervision of the\nGrambling Lab Schools.  The schools were funded through a combination of sources, including\noperational funding through the Stateโs Minimum Foundation Program (โMFPโ), a small fraction\n7\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 8 of 19 PageID #:  8126\nof locally generated funds, and generated revenues from tuition and private donations.  However, the\nlab schools were unable to pay for all of their operating expenses, resulting in annual deficits in\nrecent years, covered in full or in part by GSU. \nGHF began to govern Lincoln Prep starting in  2016-2017.  GHF was incorporated in\nLouisiana as a tax-exempt public charity in 2007.  As currently constituted, GHFโs Board of\nDirectors consists of nine board members, seven of whom are black.  At least five of the current\nboard members graduated from GSU.\nGHF originally partnered with an experienced charter school operator, Responsive Education\nSolutions, Inc. (โResponsiveEdโ), to assist with the charter schoolโs operations in exchange for 15\npercent of Lincoln Prepโs State MFP revenues.  On July 26, 2016, ResponsiveEd recommended that\nGHF delay opening Lincoln Prep until the 2017-2018 school year.  \nAfter GHF notified ResponsiveEd that it would open the school in the 2016-2017 school\nyear,  ResponsiveEd terminated its  Charter Management Organization agreement with  GHF. \nTherefore, GHF opened Lincoln Prep in the 2016-2017 school year without a charter management\norganization agreement in place.  GHF assumed responsibility for the management of Lincoln Prep,\nwhile contracting with vendors and service providers, such as 4th Sector Solutions, Inc. and School\nFood Solutions L3C.   \nLincoln Prep receives its MFP funding directly from the State.  According to State law,\nper-pupil funding for the charter school is equal to the per-pupil funding associated with each\nstudentโs parish of residence and, unlike the Grambling Lab Schoolsโ funding arrangement, includes\na local revenue representation based on charter schoolโs students as part of the MFP formula.   \n8\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 9 of 19 PageID #:  8127\nB. Student Enrollment\nThe Grambling Lab Schools were de jure segregated public schools in the formerly dual\nsystem of public schools in Lincoln Parish.  See [Doc. No. 212, p. 4  (โThe [Grambling] Laboratory\nSchools have educated students and served the Grambling community for over one hundred years,\nhaving been established under the prior dual system.โ).  Historically, the Grambling Lab Schools\nhave been racially identifiable as black schools.  By the 2015-2016 school year, only three white\nstudents were enrolled at the Grambling Lab Schools (none at Alma J. Brown, one in 6th grade at\nGMS, and two at GHS in 9th and 12th grade, respectively) out of a total school-wide enrollment of\n349 students.  There was no formal recruiting plan for white students, and GSU and the Grambling\nLab Schools had not engaged in any recruitment activities.\nLincoln Prep opened in the GSU facilities for the 2016-2017 school year with increased white\nstudent enrollment of twelve students.  However, the overall student population at Lincoln Prep\nremains disproportionately black relative to the K-12 student enrollment in LPSBโs schools.  Lincoln\nPrepโs white student enrollment of 3.2% is about 41.8 percentage points lower than the K-12 white\nstudent enrollment at LPSBโs schools.  \nC. Faculty and Staff\nThe Grambling Lab Schoolsโ faculty was predominantly and disproportionately black in\ncomparison to LPSBโs faculty.  During the 2015-2016 school year, 82.4 % of the lab schoolsโ\nteachers were black, compared with only 12.6 % in LPSBโs schools, and both of the principals at the\nlab schools (GMS and GHS shared one principal) were black.  The Grambling Lab Schoolsโ faculty\nhas been almost entirely black since at least the early 1970s.  \nDuring the 2016-2017 school year, Lincoln Prepโs faculty remained disproportionately black\n9\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 10 of 19 PageID #:  8128\nwhen compared to LPSBโs faculty.  \nD. Quality of Education\nAcademically, in the year prior to conversion, the Grambling Lab Schools received a\n2014-2015 school performance grade of D,2 while LPSBโs schools received an overall performance\ngrade of B for 2014-2015.  Alma J. Brown received a 2014-2015 school performance score of 47.5,\nGMS received a 45.4, and GHS received a 68.4, all of which were well below the Lincoln Parish\nDistrict Performance score of 95.5.\nGHF presented no evidence at the hearing to show that Lincoln Prep had improved\nperformance during the 2016-2017 school year.\nE. Facilities\nThe Grambling Lab Schools occupied three facilities on GSUโs campus.  Alma J. Brown\n(โK-5 Campusโ), the newest facility, was built in 1982 and is located on a different part of GSUโs\ncampus, separate from Grambling Middle School (โ6-8 Buildingโ) and Grambling High School\n(โ9-12 Buildingโ) (collectively, โ6-12 Campusโ).  The 6-12 Campus is located in the facility that\noriginally housed all Grambling Lab School students in grades K-12, and which consists of buildings\nconstructed in 1955 and 1965 that share common facilities, including a cafeteria and gymnasium. \nAs of the 2015-2016 school year, all of the facilities needed significant repairs or improvements. \nFor the 2016-2017 school year, Lincoln Prep continued to operate in the Grambling Lab\nfacilities.\n2Although the last year of operation for the Grambling Lab Schools was 2015-2016, the\nscores for 2014-2015 were provided during that year.\n10\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 11 of 19 PageID #:  8129\nF. Extracurricular Activities and Transportation\nThe Grambling Lab Schools used six buses to transport students during the 2015-2016 school\nyear.  LPSB owned and operated three of the buses, which transported Grambling Lab School\nstudents who lived within Lincoln Parish and requested transportation to attend the schools.  GSU\nleased three additional buses, which were operated by GSU employees and provided transportation\nto Grambling Lab School students who lived in other parishes.\nGMS and GHS students generally participated in after-school extracurricular activities\ntogether, which, during the 2015-2016 school year, included basketball, football, baseball, softball,\ntrack, band, cheerleading, dance line, and a 4-H club.  Alma J. Brown did not offer any after-school\nextracurricular activities. \nFor 2016-2017, GHF continued to provide transportation and extracurricular activities similar\nto those offered by Grambling Lab Schools.\nIV. REMEDIAL MEASURES FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE GRAMBLING LAB\n  SCHOOLS  TO  LINCOLN  PREP  AND  THE  DESEGREGATION  OF THE\nCONVERTED SCHOOL \nGiven the significant issues facing GHF in the desegregation of the converted Lincoln Prep,\nthe Court has determined that an Interim Order addressing three main areas of immediate concern\nhas the greatest likelihood of success.  While the Court will provide some basic guidance in the other\nareas, the Courtโs focus in this Interim Order will be on the Green factors of student assignment and\nfaculty and staff assignment, as well as the composition of GHFโs Board of Directors. \nA. Student Assignment\nGHF shall, by the 2020-2021 school year, increase the percentage of white students enrolled\nat Lincoln Prep, so that it is within plus or minus 20 percentage points of the percentage of white\n11\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 12 of 19 PageID #:  8130\nstudents enrolled in grades K-12  in LPSBโs schools.   GHF will thereafter exercise good faith efforts\nto maintain the percentage of white students enrolled in the school within that range.  To accomplish\nthese enrollment targets, GHF shall take the following actions:\n1. White Student Admissions Targets for School Years 2017-2018 and\n2018-2019\nBeginning with the 2017-2018 school year, GHF will have a percentage enrollment of 8%\nwhite students.  For the following school year, 2018-2019, GHF will have a percentage enrollment\nof 14% white students.  GHF will take affirmative measures-via an actively managed enrollment\nprocess-to reach the annual white student enrollment targets for each entering kindergarten class and\nfor higher grade levels. \n2. Lottery Exemption\nBecause Lincoln Prep is a state charter school, students are admitted, at least in part, through\na lottery process.  Until Lincoln Prep achieves a school-wide white student enrollment that is within\nplus or minus 20 percent of LPSBโs white student enrollment or until the Court orders otherwise,\nthe following conditions will apply:\na. White students who reside in the State of Louisiana and apply to\nthe charter school are eligible for admission and, therefore, will be admitted to Lincoln Prep on a\nfirst-priority basis (i.e., all white applicants eligible for admission will be admitted first before (i)\nexisting/returning black students, and (ii) the siblings of current black students); and  \nb. To the extent that a lottery is conducted for the randomized admission\nof students to Lincoln Prep, all existing/returning white students, white siblings of existing/returning\nwhite students, and new white student applicants will be exempt from such lottery.  \n12\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 13 of 19 PageID #:  8131\n3. Overall Student Enrollment and Growth Plan\nThe Court modifies student enrollment from its August 2016 conditions.  GHF is limited to\nenrolling 360 black students at Lincoln Prep, beginning with the 2017-2018 school year.  GHF may\nenroll any number of white students or students of other races, subject only to the limits imposed by\nthe State.    \n4. Enrollment Application Form\nTo ensure that administrators can implement the requirements of this Order, the application\nform for admission to Lincoln Prep will include a field requesting the race of each student who\napplies.  If a studentโs self-identified race differs from the race listed on his or her original birth\ncertificate, this fact must be noted on the application form.   \n5. Elimination of Tuition\nConsistent with the requirements of State law and the obligation to desegregate the converted\ncharter school under federal law, students attending Lincoln Prep will not be charged-and GHF will\nnot accept-tuition as a condition for enrollment at the school.\nB. Faculty and Staff\nGHF will conduct hiring for all employment positions on a racially non-discriminatory basis\nand will take affirmative measures to recruit white candidates for administrator, teacher, certified\nstaff, and other staff positions at the school. GHF will conduct its hiring to increase the percentage\nof white faculty and staff members to a level that is within plus or minus 20% of the total white\npopulation of Lincoln Parish, as measured by the 2014 demographic estimates from the U.S. Census\nBureauโs American Community Survey. \n13\n\nCase 3:66-cv-12071-RGJ   Document 287   Filed 08/01/17   Page 14 of 19 PageID #:  8132\n1. Hiring\nFor faculty and staff hiring, GHF will take the following actions for the 2017-2018 school\nyear and for each year thereafter during the term of this Order:\na.
