    "summary": "<p>On October 26, 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit civil liberties organization, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). EFF, represented by its own lawyers, asked the court for injunctive relief, claiming that the DOJ was withholding agency records concerning the DOJ's interpretation and use of Section 215 of the Patriot Act without legitimate justification under any of the limited exemptions in the FOIA. Specifically, EFF claimed that the DOJ failed to expedite the processing of the requests (despite granting the request for expediting the process), denied the plaintiff's request for a public interest fee waiver, and failed to respond within the twenty-day deadline for the processing of a non-expedited FOIA request. On November 3, 2011, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint further detailing the government's withholding of records. </p><p>On February 16, 2012, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers granted the parties' proposed stipulation regarding the processing of the FOIA requests. The stipulation set a schedule for responding to the plaintiffs' FOIA request. (The schedule underwent several modifications during the litigation.) In addition, the Director of National Intelligence declassified and released to the public certain information related to the \"business records\" provision of FISA following the unauthorized disclosure of a top secret U.S. court document. As a result, the DOJ had to determine what effect, if any, this release of documents had on the classification of information in some of the withheld documents at issue in this case. </p><p>On September 6, 2013, Judge Gonzalez Rogers denied the parties' respective motions for summary judgment, without prejudice. Judge Gonzalez Rogers also ordered the DOJ to release to the plaintiff non-exempt records responsive to the plaintiff's request for significant opinions or orders of the FISC and any significant documents, procedures, or legal analyses incorporated into FISC opinions or orders that the DOJ or NSA has treated as binding. Judge Gonzalez Rogers also ordered the DOJ to complete further re-review of the remaining responsive records.</p><p>As a result of this September 2013 order, the government released hundreds of pages of previously secret FISA documents detailing the court's interpretation of Section 215, including an opinion excoriating the NSA for misusing its mass surveillance database for years. In October 2013, the government released a second batch of documents related to Section 215, which showed, among other things, that the NSA had collected cell site location without notifying its oversight committees in Congress or the FISA court. The EFF continued to argue for further disclosures of documents that the government was withholding. The government claimed that these documents were exempt from release. </p><p>On June 13, 2014, Judge Gonzalez Rogers ordered the DOJ to produce the following documents for in camera inspection by the Court to assist the Court in making a responsible de novo determination whether the documents were clearly exempt from disclosure under the FOIA: (1) FISC opinion dated 8/20/2008 (6 pages); (2) FISC order dated 10/31/2006 (19 pages); (3) FISC orders dated 2/17/2006 (17 pages); (4) FISC orders dated 2/24/2006 (8 pages); and (5) FISC orders dated 12/16/2005 (16 pages). </p><p>On July 24, 2014, Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued a second order for the DOJ to produce unredacted copies of (1) the Census Memorandum; and (2) the complete application of the DOJ in connection with which the Census Memorandum was submitted to the FISC to assist the Court in making a responsible de novo determination whether the withheld documents are clearly exempt from disclosure under FOIA. The DOJ had earlier argued that it was properly withholding a 2010 OLC memorandum which provided advice to the Department of Commerce regarding the interaction between disclosure provisions in the Patriot Act, and prohibitions on disclosure in the Census Act (‘Census Memorandum’). </p><p>On August 11, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the cross-motions. It held that the DOJ had established a proper basis for withholding, in full, the FISC orders and opinions at issue, and for withholding all names of telecommunications providers participating in the Call Records Collection Program, under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3. However, the court also found that DOJ had not established that the Census Memorandum was properly withheld under Exemption 5. 2014 WL 3945646, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110785.</p><p>On August 15, 2015, the parties reached a settlement of plaintiff’s claim for attorney’s fees, costs and expenses pursuant to the FOIA without need for further litigation. The amount was not stipulated in the notice of settlement. </p><p>The case is now closed. </p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2011, a nonprofit civil liberties organization filed a federal lawsuit in the Northern District of California under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The plaintiff asked the court to order the processing of a FOIA request submitted to the DOJ for documents concerning the DOJ's interpretation and use of Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The DOJ had failed to respond to the FOIA request within the allotted amount of time. In August 2014, the court held that the DOJ had established a proper basis for withholding, in full, the FISC orders and opinions at issue, and for withholding all names of telecommunications providers participating in the Call Records Collection Program, under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3. However, the court also found that DOJ had not established that the Census Memorandum was properly withheld under Exemption 5. The parties reached a settlement for attorney’s fees without need for further litigation in August 2015. The case is now closed. ",

The \n16 identification and exploitation of terrorist communications are critical tools in this effort.   \n17 In response to unauthorized disclosures about intelligence-gathering activities conducted \n18 by the National Security Agency (“NSA”), the government has acknowledged the existence and \n19 certain details of a counter-terrorism program to identify and exploit such terrorist \n20 communications.  Under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1861(a)(1), the \n21 NSA obtains and may review, pursuant to orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n22 (“FISC”), bulk telephony metadata – business records created by telecommunications service \n23 providers that include such information as the telephone numbers placing and receiving calls, \n24 and the time and duration of those calls, but not their content.   \n25 Plaintiff in this Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) case, the Electronic Frontier \n26 Foundation, seeks release of documents that contain a significant legal interpretation of the \n27 government’s authority under Section 215.  As a result of discretionary decisions by the Director \n28 of National Intelligence (“DNI”) to acknowledge and declassify certain information concerning \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    1 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page10 of 33\n \n1 telephony metadata collection and other counter-terrorism activities, the government has released \n2 to the public thousands of pages of declassified documents.  Among those are over 1000 pages \n3 produced to plaintiff and responsive to its FOIA request.  Nonetheless, many operational details \n4 related to specific applications of the intelligence sources and methods used by the United States \n5 to carry out its authority under Section 215 remain classified today.  That is because exposure of \n6 those highly sensitive intelligence sources and methods to the United States’ adversaries would \n7 risk serious or exceptionally grave damage to national security.   As a result, defendant has \n8 withheld some documents, and redacted information from others, responsive to plaintiff’s FOIA \n9 request. \n10 The information that the government continues to withhold is exempt from FOIA \n11 disclosure because it is currently and properly classified, and therefore subject to FOIA \n12 Exemption 1; because it is protected by statute, and therefore subject to FOIA Exemption 3; \n13 because its release would interfere with an ongoing national security investigation, and therefore \n14 is subject to Exemption 7(A); and/or because it concerns sensitive law enforcement methods and \n15 techniques still employed today by the government in national security investigations, and \n16 therefore is subject to FOIA Exemption 7(E).  By agreement of the parties, their cross-summary \n17 judgment motions will focus on withholding of such information in a sample of documents, \n18 opinions and orders of the FISC.  In addition, defendant has withheld a single legal advice \n19 memorandum prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC”) for the Department of \n20 Commerce, which is protected by the deliberative process privilege and, therefore, subject to \n21 FOIA Exemption 5.   \n22   As set forth below, and in the declarations of government officials submitted herewith, \n23 the withheld documents or portions of documents over which the parties will cross-move for \n24 summary judgment are properly exempt from disclosure under FOIA.  The Court should, \n25 therefore, grant summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff’s FOIA claim.  \n26\n27\n28\nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    2 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page11 of 33\n \n1 BACKGROUND \n2 A.  Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act \n3 Section 215 – originally enacted on October 26, 2001 as part of USA PATRIOT Act, \n4 Pub. L. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272  (2001) – amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 \n5 U.S.C. § 1801, et seq. (“FISA”). Section 215 authorizes the FISC, an Article III court \n6 composed of 11 appointed U.S. district judges, see 50 U.S.C. § 1803, to issue an order for the \n7 “production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other \n8 items) for an investigation [1] to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a \n9 United States person or [2] to protect against international terrorism.”  50 U.S.C. § 1861(a)(1).  \n10 The investigation must be authorized and conducted under guidelines approved by the \n11 Attorney General under Executive Order 12333 (or a successor thereto), id. § 1861(a)(2)(A), \n12 (b)(2)(A), and the Government’s application must include, among other things, a statement of \n13 facts showing that there are “reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things sought are \n14 relevant” to the investigation in question.  Id. § 1861(b)(2)(A).   \n15 Information contained in the records or other items received in response to a Section \n16 215 order “concerning any United States person may be used and disclosed by [the \n17 Government] without the consent of [that] person only in accordance with . . . minimization \n18 procedures,” adopted by the Attorney General and enumerated in the Government’s \n19 application, that “minimize the retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly \n20 available information concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need \n21 . . . to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.”  Id. \n22 § 1861(b)(2)(B), (g)(2), (h).  The FISC must find these requirements have been met before it \n23 issues the requested order, which must direct that the minimization procedures set forth in the \n24 application be followed.  Id. § 1861(c)(1). \n25 As initially enacted, Section 215 was set to expire on December 31, 2005.  USA \n26 PATRIOT Act, § 224.  Congress subsequently reauthorized Section 215 for limited periods of \n27 time on several occasions.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1861 note.  On May 26, 2011, Congress reauthorized \n28\nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    3 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page12 of 33\n \n1 Section 215 until June 1, 2015.  See PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-\n2 14, 125 Stat. 216 (2011). \n3 Under the bulk telephony metadata collection program acknowledged by the DNI, the \n4 FBI has since May 2006 obtained orders from the FISC under Section 215 directing certain \n5 telecommunications service providers to produce to the NSA, on a daily basis, electronic copies \n6 of “call detail records” containing “telephony metadata,” created by the recipient providers for \n7 calls to, from, or within the United States.  The NSA has then stored and queried the metadata for \n8 counter-terrorism purposes.  Under the FISC’s orders, the NSA’s authority to continue the \n9 program expires after approximately 90 days and must be renewed.  The FISC first authorized \n10 the program in May 2006, and since then has renewed the program over 35 times, under orders \n11 issued by at least 15 different FISC judges, most recently on the date of this filing, March 28, \n12 2014.1 \n13 The President made changes to the program in 2014, and Congress is considering further \n14 changes.  On January 17, 2014, the President ordered a transition that would end the Section 215 \n15 bulk telephony metadata program as it then existed and establish a new mechanism to preserve \n16 critical capabilities without the government holding bulk telephony metadata.   See “FACT \n17 SHEET:  The Administration’s Proposal for Ending the Section 215 Bulk Telephony Metadata \n18 Program,” available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/27/fact-sheet-\n19 administration-s-proposal-ending-section-215-bulk-telephony-m (last visited March 28, 2014).  \n20 Pursuant to the President’s direction, the Department of Justice asked the FISC to modify the \n21 orders under which telephony metadata program is conducted to ensure that (1) absent an \n22\n                            \n23   1 See In re Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible \nThings from [Redacted], Dkt. No. BR 13-109 (F.I.S.C. Aug. 29, 2013) (Exh. C) at 29; In re \n24\nApplication of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things from \n25 [Redacted], Dkt. No. BR 13-158 (F.I.S.C. Oct.  11, 2013) (Exh. D) at 2-6.  See also ACLU v. \nClapper, 959 F. Supp. 2d 724 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (discussing and upholding legality of Section 215 \n26\nbulk telephony metadata collection program) (appeal docketed).  But see Klayman v. Obama, \n957 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2013) (granting preliminary injunction against application of program \n27\nto two plaintiffs) (appeal docketed).  As the Court is aware, the Section 215 telephony metadata \n28 collection program is also the subject of a pending suit before another judge of this Court.  See \nFirst Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, et al. v. NSA, Case No. 3:13-cv-03287-JSW (N.D. Cal.). \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    4 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page13 of 33\n \n1 emergency situation, a FISC judge approves the specific identifiers (e.g., telephone numbers) \n2 used to query the telephony metadata collected pursuant to the program, based on reasonable, \n3 articulable suspicion that each identifier is associated with a specified foreign terrorist group; and \n4 (2) the results of any query are limited to metadata within two “hops” (i.e., degrees of contact) of \n5 the selection term being used, instead of three.  Id.  The FISC approved the government’s \n6 requested modifications on February 5, 2014.   Id.  And this week, following a review by the \n7 Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the President made \n8 a further proposal to, with the passage of appropriate legislation, allow the government to end \n9 bulk collection of telephony metadata records under Section 215, while ensuring that the \n10 government has access to the information it needs to meet its national security requirements.  Id.  \n11 As stated in the proposal, “[g]iven that this legislation will not be in place by March 28 and given \n12 the importance of maintaining the capabilities in question, the President has directed DOJ to seek \n13 from the FISC a 90-day reauthorization of the existing program, which includes the substantial \n14 modifications in effect since February.”  Id. The Department of Justice received such a 90-day \n15 reauthorization on March 28, 2014. \n16 B.  Plaintiff’s FOIA Request and This Civil Action \n17 Background concerning plaintiff’s original FOIA request and the government’s response \n18 is set out in detail in defendant’s first Motion for Summary Judgment, which is incorporated \n19 herein by reference.  See ECF No. 40.  Plaintiff’s FOIA request, as narrowed by the parties both \n20 before and during litigation, seeks documents from defendant that contain significant legal \n21 analysis or interpretations of Section 215.  See id. See also Letter from Steven Y. Bressler to the \n22 Court dated August 22, 2012, ECF No. 32, & Letter from Mark Rumold to the Court dated \n23 August 24, 2012, ECF No. 33 (summary judgment motion pre-filing letters identifying \n24 categories of documents that were included and excluded, respectively, from further litigation at \n25 that time).   \n26   The posture of this action changed markedly in the summer and fall of 2013.  On June 6, \n27 2013, newspapers published articles and documents received from a former NSA contractor.  See \n28 Declaration of Jennifer L. Hudson (Exh. A) ¶ 15.  This “unauthorized disclosure of TOP \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    5 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page14 of 33\n \n1 SECRET documents touched on some of the U.S. Government’s most sensitive national security \n2 programs, including highly classified and on-going signals intelligence collection programs.”  Id. \n3 These unauthorized disclosures included previously classified information regarding Section \n4 215.  Id. ¶ 19.  In response, the Director of National Intelligence (“DNI”) declassified certain \n5 information regarding the collection of bulk telephony metadata pursuant to Section 215.  Id. \n6 ¶ 21.  Defendant informed the Court of the DNI’s action, and the parties asked the Court to hold \n7 their fully-briefed Cross Motions for Summary Judgment in abeyance while the government \n8 determined what impact the change in classification would have on the records at issue in this \n9 FOIA case.  Id. ¶ 22; ECF Nos. 57, 59, 61. \n10   In response to the unauthorized disclosures, on June 20, 2013, the President directed the \n11 DNI to continue to review whether further information could be declassified regarding, inter \n12 alia, activities authorized under Section 215.  Hudson Decl. ¶ 23.  Since that time, at presidential \n13 direction and under guidance by the DNI, the U.S. Government has “engaged in a large-scale, \n14 multi-agency review process” to “determine what further information concerning programs \n15 under Section 215 and other surveillance programs could be declassified and released consistent \n16 with the national security for the purpose of restoring public confidence and better explaining the \n17 legal rationale and protections surrounding the programs.”  Id. ¶ 24.  The government \n18 reprocessed documents responsive to plaintiff’s FOIA request as part of this broader review.  Id.   \n19   As a result of this initiative, the DNI exercised his discretion under Executive Order \n20 13526 to declassify and publicly release a number of documents pertaining to telephony \n21 metadata collection under Section 215, including over 1,000 pages responsive to plaintiff’s FOIA \n22 request as well as additional documents outside the scope of that request.  Id. ¶ 26; see also \n23 “Office of the DNI: IC On the Record,” available at ICOntheRecord.tumblr.com (last visited \n24 March 28, 2014).   \n25 The parties recently proposed, and the Court agreed, that summary judgment motion \n26 practice would “focus on a representative sample of withheld documents consisting of all \n27 responsive Orders and Opinions of the FISC.”  ECF Nos. 71, 72.  The parties agree that the \n28 Court’s determinations on the withholding of specific information from the representative \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    6 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page15 of 33\n \n1 sample will “count not simply for” the sample, but for similar information in “non-sample \n2 documents still withheld.”  Bonner v. Dep’t of State, 928 F.2d 1148, 1152 (D.C. Cir. 1991). See \n3 Meeropol v. Meese, 790 F.2d 942, 958 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (such sampling allows a reviewing court \n4 “to extrapolate its conclusions from the representative sample to the larger group of withheld \n5 material”) (internal quotation omitted).   \n6 While the DNI declassified considerable information pertaining to Section 215, \n7 operational details as to specific applications of the sources and methods used by the United \n8 States pursuant to Section 215 remain classified.  Hudson Decl. ¶ 27.   Therefore, the information \n9 redacted from documents produced to plaintiff is exempt from FOIA disclosure under various \n10 statutory exemptions.  In particular, as described below and in the public and classified \n11 Declarations of Jennifer Hudson and the Declaration of Paul Colborn, defendant has withheld \n12 information pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7(A), 7(C),2 and 7(E).   \n13   Accordingly, the United States Department of Justice now seeks summary judgment \n14 concerning its withholding of exempt information under the FOIA. \n15 ARGUMENT \n \n16\nI.  FOIA Requires the Disclosure Only of Non-Exempt Records, and This Court \nLacks Authority to Compel the Disclosure of Exempt Records \n17\n \n18 The Freedom of Information Act was enacted to “pierce the veil of administrative secrecy \n19 and to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.”  Dep’t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. \n20 352, 361 (1976) (internal quotation omitted).  However, the public’s interest in government \n21 information under FOIA is not absolute – “[i]t extends only to information that sheds light upon \n22 the government’s performance of its duties.”  Hale v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 973 F.2d 894, 898 \n23 (10th Cir. 1992), vacated on other grounds, 509 U.S. 918 (1993).  “Congress recognized . . .  that \n24 public disclosure is not always in the public interest.”  CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 166-67 (1985). \n25 FOIA’s “basic purpose” reflects a “general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless \n26 information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.”  John Doe Agency v. John \n27\n                            \n28 2 Plaintiff has informed defendant that plaintiff does not challenge the withholdings \npursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C), which include the names of individuals. \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    7 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page16 of 33\n \n1 Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989) (quoting Rose, 425 U.S. at 360-361 (1976)) (other citation \n2 omitted).  FOIA is designed to achieve a “workable balance between the right of the public to \n3 know and the need of the Government to keep information in confidence to the extent necessary \n4 without permitting indiscriminate secrecy.”  Id. (citation omitted).   \n5 Toward that end, FOIA incorporates “nine exemptions . . . which a government agency \n6 may invoke to protect certain documents from public disclosure.”  Minier v. CIA, 88 F.3d 796, \n7 800 (9th Cir. 1996).  Despite the “liberal congressional purpose” of FOIA, the Supreme Court \n8 has recognized that the statutory exemptions are intended to have “meaningful reach and \n9 application.”  John Doe, 493 U.S. at 152.  “A district court only has jurisdiction to compel an \n10 agency to disclose improperly withheld agency records,” i.e., records that do “not fall within an \n11 exemption.”  Minier, 88 F.3d at 803 (emphasis in original).  Thus, “[r]equiring an agency to \n12 disclose exempt information is not authorized by FOIA.”  Id. (quoting Spurlock v. FBI, 69 F.3d \n13 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 1995)). \n14 FOIA actions are generally resolved through summary judgment motions pursuant to \n15 Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  See Miscavige v. IRS, 2 F.3d 366, 369 (11th Cir. 1993) (“Generally, FOIA \n16 cases should be handled on motions for summary judgment . . .”); Coastal Delivery Corp. v. U.S. \n17 Customs Serv., 272 F. Supp. 2d 958, 962 (C.D. Cal. 2003) (same, citing id.).  Under FOIA, \n18 courts conduct de novo review to determine whether the government properly withheld records \n19 under any of the FOIA=s nine statutory exemptions.  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).  The government \n20 bears the burden of justifying non-disclosure.  Minier, 88 F.3d at 800.  “The agency may meet its \n21 burden by submitting a detailed affidavit showing that the information ‘logically falls within the \n22 claimed exemptions.’”  Id. (quoting in part Hunt v. CIA, 981 F.2d 1116, 1119 (9th Cir. 1992)).  \n23 Thus, “[c]ourts are permitted to rule on summary judgment in FOIA cases solely on the basis of \n24 government affidavits describing the documents sought.”  Lion Raisins v. Dep’t of Agriculture, \n25 354 F.3d 1072, 1082 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  “If the affidavits contain reasonably \n26 detailed descriptions of the documents and allege facts sufficient to establish an exemption, the \n27 district court need look no further.”  Lane v. Dep’t of the Interior, 523 F.3d 1128, 1135-36 (9th \n28 Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted).   \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    8 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page17 of 33\n \n1 Critically, although the government “may not rely upon conclusory and generalized \n2 allegations of exemptions,” it “need not specify its objections in such detail as to compromise the \n3 secrecy of the information.”  See Church of Scientology of Cal. v. Dep’t of the Army, 611 F.2d \n4 738, 742 (9th Cir. 1979) (internal quotation omitted).  The Court must accord a presumption of \n5 good faith to agency declarations submitted in support of claimed exemptions.  Safecard Servs., \n6 Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991). \n7 Moreover, courts afford deference to the agency=s declarations regarding withholding in \n8 instances of national security – “a uniquely executive purview.”  Ctr. for Nat’l Sec. Studies v. \n9 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 331 F.3d 918, 926-27 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  Although the court still conducts \n10 de novo review of an agency=s actions, “de novo review in FOIA cases is not everywhere alike.” \n11 Ass’n of Retired R.R. Workers, Inc. v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., 830 F.2d 331, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  \n12 Because “courts have little expertise in either international diplomacy or counterintelligence \n13 operations, [they] are in no position to dismiss the [agency’s] facially reasonable concerns” about \n14 the harm that disclosure could cause to national security.  Frugone v. CIA, 169 F.3d 772, 775 \n15 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  As the Ninth Circuit has directed, for exemptions related to national security, \n16 “the district court [is] required to accord ‘substantial weight’ to [the agency’s] affidavits” as long \n17 as it is not “controverted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of [agency] bad \n18 faith.”  Hunt, 981 F.2d at 1119 (citation, internal quotation omitted).  \n19 The discussion below, the declarations, and the Vaughn index demonstrate that the \n20 government has provided the proper bases for all of the challenged withholdings pursuant to 5 \n21 U.S.C.  § 552(b).  Because defendant has shown that it has properly withheld materials that are \n22 exempt from disclosure, the government is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s claims. \n \n23 II.  The Defendants Have Properly Withheld Records that Are Exempt from \nDisclosure under FOIA  \n24  \nA.  The Defendants Have Properly Withheld Records under FOIA \n25\nExemption 1 \n26 FOIA Exemption 1 protects records that are: “(A) specifically authorized under criteria \n27 established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign \n28 policy, and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to Executive order.”  5 U.S.C. § 552 \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    9 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page18 of 33\n \n1 (b)(1); accord, e.g., Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw., 454 U.S. 139, 144 (1981).  In other \n2 words, under Exemption 1 material that has been properly classified is exempt from disclosure.  \n3 Id. at 144-45.  For information to be properly classified pursuant to Exemption 1, it must meet \n4 the requirements of Executive Order 13,526, “Classified National Security Information,” 75 Fed. \n5 Reg. 707 (Dec. 29, 2009): \n   \n6 (1)  an original classification authority is classifying the information;  \n(2)  the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United \n7\nStates Government; \n(3)  the information falls within one or more of the categories of information listed in section \n8\n1.4 of this order; and \n(4)  the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the \n9\ninformation reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, \nwhich includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original classification \n10\nauthority is able to identify or describe the damage. \n11\nId. § 1.1, 75 Fed. Reg. at 707; see Hudson Decl. ¶ 31.  The Executive Order lists three \n12\nclassification levels for national security information:  top secret, secret, and confidential.  Id. \n13\n§ 1.2, 75 Fed. Reg. at 707-08.  The government’s declarant, Jennifer L. Hudson, is an original \n14\nclassification authority.  See Hudson Decl. ¶ 3. \n15\nAs noted, in reviewing classification determinations under Exemption 1, the courts have \n16\nrepeatedly stressed that “substantial weight” must be accorded agency affidavits concerning \n17\nclassified status of the records at issue, and that summary judgment is appropriate if the agency \n18\nsubmits a detailed affidavit showing that the information logically falls within the exemption.  \n19\nSee Minier, 88 F.3d at 800; see also Halperin v. CIA, 629 F.2d 144, 148 (D.C. Cir. 1980) \n20\n(“summary judgment may be granted on the basis of agency affidavits if they contain reasonable \n21\nspecificity of detail rather than merely conclusory statements, and if they are not called into \n22\nquestion by contradictory evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith”).  \n23\nMoreover, if “the agency’s statements meet this standard, the court is not to conduct a detailed \n24\ninquiry to decide whether it agrees with the agency’s opinions; to do so would violate the \n25\nprinciple of affording substantial weight to the expert opinion of the agency.”  Id.; see also \n26\nFrugone, 169 F.3d at 775 (“Mindful that courts have little expertise in either international \n27\ndiplomacy or counterintelligence operations, we are in no position to dismiss the CIA’s facially \n28\nreasonable concerns.”); Salisbury v. United States, 690 F.2d 966, 970 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“‘The \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    10 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page19 of 33\n \n1 Executive departments responsible for national defense and foreign policy matters have unique \n2 insights into what adverse [effects] might occur as a result of public disclosure of a particular \n3 classified record.’”) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1200, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1974)).   \n4 The declarations and Vaughn index submitted herewith fully support application of \n5 Exemption 1, as they describe “the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific \n6 detail,” Hunt, 981 F.2d at 1119, and “demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls \n7 within the claimed exemption[].”  Id.; see also Berman v. CIA, 501 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir. \n8 2007) (same); Minier, 88 F.3d at 800 (same).  See Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 30-119; Classified Hudson \n9 Decl.   Ms. Hudson’s declarations establish that the government has withheld classified \n10 information that relates to intelligence activities, sources, and methods that, if disclosed, could be \n11 expected to cause serious or exceptionally grave damage to national security.  See Hudson Decl., \n12 && 39-114; Classified Hudson Decl.  See also Exec. Ord. No. 13,526 § 1.4(c) (information \n13 pertaining to “intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or \n14 cryptology” may be classified if its disclosure could reasonably be expected to damage national \n15 security). \n16 For example, the government has withheld information that would identify \n17 telecommunications service providers who were ordered to produce business records containing \n18 information about communications between telephone numbers.  As Ms. Hudson explains in her \n19 declaration, disclosing whether particular telecommunications companies assisted with NSA \n20 intelligence activities could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security \n21 by, inter alia, revealing to foreign adversaries which channels of communication may or may not \n22 be secure and, thus, providing a roadmap to avoid U.S. government surveillance and find \n23 alternative means to communicate in the course of plotting activity such as terrorist attacks.  \n24 Hudson Decl. ¶ 58-65, 84.  Accord Halkin v. Helms, 598 F.2d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (rejecting \n25 argument “that admission or denial of the fact of acquisition of [certain] communications … \n26 would not reveal which circuits NSA has targeted” as “naïve”). The potentially grave damage to \n27 national security of such disclosures, or other, further disclosures, is not reduced by the fact that \n28 the government has now declassified the existence of the telephony metadata program under \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    11 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page20 of 33\n \n1 Section 215.   As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, official confirmation of general information \n2 about an intelligence program (such as its existence) does not eliminate the risk to national \n3 security of compelling further disclosures of information about the program’s details.  Mohamed \n4 v. Jeppesen, 614 F.3d 1070, 1086, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010) (official acknowledgment of existence of \n5 CIA extraordinary rendition program did not preclude details of program remaining state secrets \n6 if details’ disclosure would risk harm to national security); Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. \n7 Bush, 507 F.3d 1190, 1203 (9th Cir. 2007) (concluding that even though the Government had \n8 publicly acknowledged the existence of terrorist surveillance program, disclosing whether the \n9 plaintiff had been surveilled would compromise national security).  As discussed below, the \n10 identities of telecommunications carriers served with Section 215 orders are also protected from \n11 disclosure by FOIA Exemption 3.3     \n12 The government has also withheld specific and detailed statistical information that would \n13 reveal the scope of bulk telephony metadata collection.  Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 46-47, 51.  As Ms. \n14 Hudson explains, disclosing statistics such as the aggregate number of call detail records \n15 collected by the NSA under the Section 215 bulk telephony metadata program would reveal the \n16 types of communications that are safe from collection, as well as the scope of the program.  Id. \n17 ¶ 47.  This would allow for possible deduction of the service providers subject to the relevant \n18 FISC orders, which, like direct revelation of carriers’ identities, could allow adversaries of the \n19 United States to devise ways to evade surveillance.  Id.  As discussed below, this material \n20\n                            \n3 Congress also recognized the need to protect the identities of telecommunications \n21\ncarriers alleged to have assisted the United States when Congress enacted provisions of the FISA \n22 Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-261, 122 Stat. 2467, Title II, § 201 (July 10, 2008), which \nprovided such carriers immunity from civil suit when certain conditions are met.  In \n23 recommending enactment of the legislation, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found \nthat “electronic surveillance for law enforcement and intelligence purposes depends in great part \n24\non the cooperation of private companies that operate the nation’s telecommunications system.”  \n25 S. Rep. 110-209, at 9 (2007) (accompanying S. 2248).  The Report expressly stated that, in \nconnection with alleged assistance by telecommunications companies after the attacks of \n26\nSeptember 11, 2001, “it would be inappropriate to disclose the names of the electronic \ncommunication service providers from which assistance was sought” and that the “identities of \n27\npersons or entities who provide assistance to the intelligence community are properly protected \n28 as sources and methods of intelligence.”  Id. Accord 50 U.S.C. § 403-1(i) (protecting intelligence \nsources and methods from disclosure; discussed infra). \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    12 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page21 of 33\n \n1 concerning signals intelligence and NSA activities is also exempt from disclosure under FOIA \n2 Exemption 3.   \n3 The government has also withheld certain details related to the collection of signals \n4 intelligence with pen register/trap and trace devices pursuant to provisions of FISA separate from \n5 Section 215, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841-1846.  Those details include the dates and docket numbers of \n6 FISC orders or opinions.  The DNI has publicly acknowledged that email metadata was collected \n7 under a program reauthorized by the FISC approximately every 90 days from its inception until \n8 its termination in 2011, except for a brief period.  See Hudson Decl. ¶ 717.  As Ms. Hudson \n9 explains, revealing FISC docket numbers and dates of opinions or orders regarding this program \n10 would permit adversaries of the United States to “deduce or infer the time period for which the \n11 program was not operational, thereby determining which of their communications (email \n12 metadata) may have escaped NSA collection and querying.”  Id. As discussed below, this \n13 information is also subject to Exemption 3.    \n14 The government has also withheld certain information pertaining to an operational \n15 technique that the FISC authorized the government to use to query a database of telephony \n16 metadata, using certain approved telephone identifiers.  Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 98-103.  As Ms. \n17 Hudson explains, disclosure of this intelligence method would compromise NSA’s ability to \n18 analyze bulk metadata which, in turn, would hamper the Intelligence Community’s \n19 “identification of previously unknown persons of interest in support of anti-terrorism efforts” and \n20 may allow adversaries of the United States to take countermeasures and degrade the \n21 effectiveness of the NSA’s surveillance and analysis.  Id. ¶ 102.  As Ms. Hudson testifies, the \n22 government cannot provide further public explanation of the classification of this intelligence \n23 method without risking disclosure of the very information the government seeks to protect.  Id. \n24 ¶ 103.  Should the Court require further information concerning this method, Ms. Hudson \n25 provides it in her classified, ex parte submission to the Court. 4    As discussed below, \n26 intelligence methods including this one are also protected from disclosure by FOIA Exemption 3.  \n                            \n27\n4   In camera, ex parte review of classified declarations in FOIA cases is common and \n28 appropriate where a more detailed public explanation cannot be provided without revealing the \nvery information that is sought to be protected.  See, e.g., Krikorian v. Dep’t of State, 984 F.2d \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    13 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page22 of 33\n \n1 Finally, the government has also withheld in full, pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3, five \n2 FISC orders to protect intelligence sources and methods used by the government to gather \n3 intelligence data.   Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 105-110.  The orders discuss specific techniques authorized \n4 by the FISC, the details of the underlying investigations, and details concerning how the \n5 government operationally and technically implements the FISC-authorized techniques, which the \n6 government continues to employ.  Id. ¶ 107.   As Ms. Hudson explains, revelation of the \n7 intelligence activities or methods described in the FISC orders would allow sophisticated targets \n8 of national security investigations to divine what information the United States was collecting at \n9 particular times, as well as gaps in surveillance, thus providing a roadmap for evading such \n10 surveillance.  Id. Details, such as docket numbers, would also allow targets to piece together a \n11 fuller picture of the FISC-authorized surveillance in question, and therefore better devise \n12 countermeasures.  Id. ¶ 108.   As Ms. Hudson explains, in combination with already-public \n13 information this would permit the targets of national security investigations to thwart those \n14 investigations, thereby risking serious damage to national security.  Id.  As discussed below, this \n15 information is also protected from FOIA disclosure by Exemptions 3 and/or 7(E).  Should the \n16 Court require further information concerning this method, Ms. Hudson provides it in her \n17 classified, ex parte submission to the Court.    \n18 The bases for Ms. Hudson’s conclusions that the information withheld pursuant to \n19 Exemption 1 remains classified is well documented in both her public and classified, ex parte \n                                                                                        \n20 461, 464-65 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Maynard v. CIA, 986 F.2d 547, 557 (1st Cir. 1993); Hayden v. \nNSA, 608 F.2d 1381, 1385 (D.C. Cir. 1979); Greyshock v. U.S. Coast Guard, No. 96-15266, 107 \n21\nF.3d 16, 1997 WL 51514, at *3 (9th Cir. Feb. 6, 1997) (unpublished) (“It is well settled that a \n22 court may examine an agency declaration in camera and ex parte when release of the declaration \nwould disclose the very information that the agency seeks to protect.” (citation omitted)).  Of \n23 course, the Court should “require the government to justify FOIA withholdings in as much detail \nas possible on the public record before resorting to in camera review.”  Lion Raisins, 354 F.3d at \n24\n1084 (requiring government to submit public declarations where it had previously submitted \n25 none, but had relied solely on an in camera submission).  However, the government has provided \n“as detailed public affidavits and testimony as possible,” and so in camera review of classified \n26\naffidavits, if necessary, is “appropriate.”   See Weiner v. FBI, 943 F.2d 972, 979 (9th Cir. 1991) \n(internal quotation omitted).  Thus, should the Court find the public declaration sufficient, it need \n27\nnot consider the classified submission, but if additional justification is needed, the Court may \n28 then find it in the classified material.  E.g., Mobley v. Dep’t of Justice, 870 F. Supp. 2d 61, 69 \n(D.D.C. 2012); Amnesty Int’l v. CIA, 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 507-08 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    14 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page23 of 33\n \n1 declarations, and her judgment that disclosure of that information would be harmful to national \n2 security is entitled to “utmost deference” by the courts.  Kasza v. Browner, 133 F.3d 1159, 1166 \n3 (9th Cir. 1998). \n \n4 B.  Defendant Has Properly Withheld Records Under FOIA Exemption 3 \n \n5\nThe government has properly invoked Exemption 3, which applies to records that are \n6\n“specifically exempted from disclosure” by other federal statutes “if that statute – establishes \n7\nparticular criteria for withholding or refers to the particular types of material to be withheld.”  5 \n8\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(3).  In promulgating FOIA, Congress included Exemption 3 to recognize the \n9\nexistence of collateral statutes that limit the disclosure of information held by the government, \n10\nand to incorporate such statutes within FOIA’s exemptions.  See Balridge v. Shapiro, 455 U.S. \n11\n345, 352-53 (1982); Essential Info., Inc. v. U.S. Info. Agency, 134 F.3d 1165, 1166 (D.C. Cir. \n12\n1998).  Under Exemption 3, “the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and \n13\nthe inclusion of withheld material within the statute’s coverage.”  Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d \n14\n755, 761-62 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  Exemption 3 also applies to every document for which the \n15\ngovernment has asserted Exemption 1. \n16\nThe government’s declarations support the “two-part inquiry [that] determines whether \n17\nExemption 3 applies to a given case.”  Minier, 88 F.3d at 800-01 (citing Sims, 471 U.S. at 167).  \n18\n“First, a court must determine whether there is a statute within the scope of Exemption 3.  Then, \n19\nit must determine whether the requested information falls within the scope of the statute.”  Id.  In \n20\nthis case, the government has withheld responsive FISC opinions and orders interpreting or \n21\ndiscussing Section 215.  See generally Hudson Decl.; id. ¶¶ 34-38.  As Ms. Hudson explains in \n22\nher public declaration (and even more fully in her classified declaration), many of these materials \n23\nare properly withheld under one or more Exemption 3 statutes.   \n24\nFirst, the government has withheld information that would reveal intelligence sources and \n25\nmethods under the National Security Act of 1947, as amended by the Intelligence Reform and \n26\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004, 50 U.S.C. § 403-1(i), which protects intelligence sources and \n27\nmethods from unauthorized disclosure. See, e.g., Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 50 (aggregate numbers of call \n28\ndetail records that would risk disclosure of the identities of service providers who are intelligence \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    15 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page24 of 33\n \n1 sources), 65, 79, 83 (identities of service providers who are intelligence sources); 87 (NSA \n2 operational technique is an intelligence method); 101 (intelligence method used to query \n3 telephony metadata or call detail records); 106, 111-12.  This statute indisputably qualifies as an \n4 Exemption 3 statute.   See ACLU v. Dep’t of Defense, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011); \n5 Larson v. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 868 (D.C. Cir. 2009); N.Y. Times Co. v. Dep’t of Justice, \n6 872 F. Supp. 2d 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2012); N.Y. Times Co. v. DOD, 499 F. Supp. 2d 501, 512 \n7 (S.D.N.Y. 2007).   \n8 As the Supreme Court discussed in Sims, it is the duty of the responsible Executive \n9 Branch officials, “not that of the judiciary, to weigh the variety of complex and subtle factors in \n10 determining whether disclosure of information may lead to an unacceptable risk of \n11 compromising” intelligence sources and methods. 471 U.S. at 180.  The Court observed that, in \n12 the National Security Act of 1947, Congress did not limit the scope of “intelligence sources and \n13 methods” in any way.  Id. at 169.  Rather, it “simply and pointedly protected all sources of \n14 intelligence that provide, or are engaged to provide, information the [responsible agency] needs \n15 to perform its statutory duties with respect to [the relevant intelligence activities].” Id. at 169-\n16 170.  Applying this deferential standard, the government’s classified submission establishes that \n17 the documents withheld pursuant to Exemption 3 are, in fact, protected from disclosure under \n18 Exemption 3.   \n19 Second, some information was properly withheld under Section 6 of the National \n20 Security Agency Act of 1959, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3605, which provides that “[n]othing in \n21 this Act or any other law . . . shall be construed to require the disclosure of the organization or \n22 any function of the National Security Agency, or any information with respect to the activities \n23 thereof . . . .”  Ms. Hudson explains that various pieces of withheld information would, if not \n24 redacted, disclose the organization, activities, and/or functions of the NSA.  E.g., Hudson Decl. \n25 ¶¶ 49 (aggregate number of call detail records collected by NSA), 62, 80-82 \n26 (telecommunications providers ordered to produce call detail records to NSA), 71 (dates and \n27 scope of NSA collection of data using PR/TT devices); 87 (NSA operational technique); 101 \n28 (intelligence method used by NSA to query telephony metadata or call detail records).   It is plain \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    16 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page25 of 33\n \n1 that information such as the name of an internal NSA organization, id. ¶ 52, the name of an NSA \n2 intelligence analytic tool, id. ¶ 54, and the name of an NSA database that stores Section 215 \n3 metadata, id. ¶ 97, involve “the organization or any function of the [NSA], or . . . information \n4 with respect to the activities thereof.”  50 U.S.C. § 3605.   That is sufficient to invoke Exemption \n5 3:  “The protection afforded by section 6 is, by its very terms, absolute.  If a document is covered \n6 by section 6, NSA is entitled to withhold it regardless of the requesting party’s needs.”  See \n7 Linder v. NSA, 94 F.3d 693, 698 (D.C. Cir. 1996); see id. at 696 (“A specific showing of \n8 potential harm to national security is irrelevant to the language of [section 6].  Congress has \n9 already decided that disclosure of NSA activities is potentially harmful.”) (alterations omitted); \n10 Hayden v. NSA, 608 F.2d 1381, 1390 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n \n11\nC.  Defendant Has Properly Withheld a Privileged Legal Advice \nMemorandum under FOIA Exemption 5 \n12\nDefendant has withheld a legal advice memorandum from the Office of Legal Counsel to \n13\nthe Department of Commerce pursuant to Exemption 5, which shields from mandatory \n14\ndisclosure “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available \n15\nby law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5).  The \n16\nSupreme Court has clarified that Exemption 5 exempts “those documents, and only those \n17\ndocuments [that are] normally privileged in the civil discovery context.”  NLRB v. Sears, \n18\nRoebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 149 (1975); see also Carter v. Dep’t of Commerce, 307 F.3d \n19\n1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 2002).  Exemption 5 thus protects from disclosure records that would be \n20\nprivileged in civil litigation under doctrines such as the deliberative process privilege, the \n21\nattorney-client privilege, and the attorney work-product privilege.  See United States v. Weber \n22\nAircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792, 800 (1984); see also Sears, 421 U.S. at 132, 149, 154; Maricopa \n23\nAudubon Soc’y v. U.S. Forest Serv., 108 F.3d 1082 (9th Cir. 1997). \n24\nThe principal purpose of the deliberative process privilege is to “prevent injury to the \n25\nquality of agency decisions.”  Sears, 421 U.S. at 151.  Courts have recognized that this privilege \n26\nis an “ancient [one] . . . predicated on the recognition that the quality of administrative decision-\n27\nmaking would be seriously undermined if agencies were forced to operate in a fishbowl.”  Dow \n28\nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    17 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page26 of 33\n \n1 Jones & Co. v. Dep’t of Justice, 917 F.2d 571, 573 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (internal quotations marks \n2 and citation omitted).  Thus, agencies may invoke the privilege:  (1) to encourage open, frank \n3 discussions on matters of policy between subordinates and superiors; (2) to protect against \n4 premature disclosure of proposed policies before they are finally adopted; and (3) to protect \n5 against public confusion that might result from disclosure of reasons and rationales that were not \n6 in fact ultimately the grounds for an agency’s action.  See Sears, 421 U.S. at 150-54; Assembly of \n7 State of Cal. v. Dep’t of Commerce, 968 F.2d 916, 920 (9th Cir. 1992); Russell v. Dep’t of Air \n8 Force, 682 F.2d 1045, 1048 (D.C. Cir. 1982). \n9 Documents covered by Exemption 5 include those “reflecting advisory opinions, \n10 recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental \n11 decisions and policies are formulated.”  Sears, 421 U.S. at 150 (internal quotation omitted). \n \n12 The deliberative process privilege rests on the obvious realization that officials \nwill not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential \n13\nitem of discovery and front page news, and its object is to enhance the quality of \nagency decisions by protecting open and frank discussion among those who make \n14\nthem within the Government.  \n15\nDep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8-9 (2001) (internal \n16 quotation marks and citations omitted).   \n17 The deliberative process privilege of Exemption 5 extends to those documents that are \n18 both “predecisional” and “deliberative.”  See Carter, 307 F.3d at 1089; Maricopa Audubon \n19 Soc’y, 108 F.3d at 1093; Assembly of the State of Cal., 968 F.2d at 920.  The Ninth Circuit has \n20 “adopted the D.C. Circuit’s definition of these terms.”  Maricopa Audubon Soc’y, 108 F.3d at \n21 1093.  A document is “predecisional” if it was “generated before the adoption of an agency \n22 policy.”  FTC v. Warner Comm’ns, 742 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984) (citing Coastal States \n23 Gas Corp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980)); see also Carter, 307 F.3d at \n24 1089 (a predecisional document is one prepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in \n25 arriving at his decision); see also N. Dartmouth Prop., Inc. v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 984 \n26 F. Supp. 65, 69 (D. Mass. 1997) (emphasizing the importance of protecting the “ingredients” of \n27 the agency’s decisionmaking process).  A document is “deliberative” if it is “a direct part of the \n28 deliberative process” in that it “makes recommendations or expresses opinions on legal or policy \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    18 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page27 of 33\n \n1 matters.”  Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1143-44 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  “In practice, there is \n2 some overlap” between these two terms.  Assembly of State of Cal., 968 F.2d at 920. \n3 Here, the government has withheld a single OLC legal advice memorandum pursuant to \n4 Exemption 5 and the deliberative process privilege.  That memorandum, dated January 4, 2010, \n5 was prepared by OLC for the purpose of providing confidential legal advice to the Department of \n6 Commerce regarding the interaction between disclosure provisions in the Patriot Act, as \n7 amended, and prohibitions on disclosure in the Census Act, 13 U.S.C. §§ 8, 9, 214 (2006).  \n8 Declaration of Paul Colborn (Exh. B) ¶ 13.  As Mr. Colborn explains,  \n \n9\n[t]he Memorandum is pre-decisional because it was prepared by OLC to aid the \nDepartment of Commerce in considering what actions to take, consistent with the \n10\nagency’s legal obligations, with respect to the potential disclosure of census information \n11 to federal law enforcement or national security officers.  The Memorandum is \ndeliberative because it constitutes legal advice from OLC to the Department of \n12\nCommerce for use in the agency’s deliberations regarding how to comply with its legal \n13 obligations regarding the confidentiality of census information.  \n \n14\nId. ¶ 15.5  The government has properly determined that these materials are subject to the \n15\ndeliberative process privilege, and should be withheld as exempt from disclosure under FOIA \n16\nExemption 5.  As noted, the memorandum is deliberative in nature, such that its disclosure would \n17\nharm Executive Branch deliberative processes by chilling free and frank discussions on matters \n18\nof law and policy.  Colborn Decl., && 13-21.  “Protecting the confidentiality of OLC’s \n19\nmemoranda conveying legal advice provided in the context of Executive Branch deliberations is \n20\nessential both to ensure that creative and sometimes controversial legal arguments and theories \n21\nmay be examined candidly, effectively, and in writing, and to ensure that the President, his \n22\nadvisers, and other Executive Branch officials continue to request and rely on frank legal advice \n23\n                            \n5   As Mr. Colborn explains in his declaration, the Census Memorandum was shared with \n24\nthe U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in April 2011.  Colborn Decl. ¶ 17 & Exh. D.  \n25 In a letter accompanying the memorandum, the Department of Justice “asked that ‘the \nCommittee maintain the confidentiality of this opinion, which provided confidential legal advice \n26\nto a client and has not been released publicly.’”  Id.  Disclosure to a congressional committee of \na document protected by the deliberative process privilege does not waive the privilege.  See, \n27\ne.g., Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. Dep’t of Justice, 235 F.3d 598, 604 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  This is \n28 particularly true when, as here, the disclosure is accompanied by a request that the congressional \ncommittee preserve the document’s confidentiality.  Id.  \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    19 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page28 of 33\n \n1 from OLC on sensitive matters.”  Id. & 16; see also Sears, 421 U.S. at 150-51 (“[T]hose who \n2 expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for \n3 appearances . . . to the detriment of the decisionmaking process.”) (internal quotation marks \n4 omitted).  Legal advice “fits exactly within the deliberative process rationale for Exemption 5.”  \n5 Brinton v. Dep’t of State, 636 F.2d 600, 604 (D.C. Cir. 1980).   \n6   Courts have affirmed this principle with specific reference to OLC legal advice \n7 documents such as the one at issue here.  Notably, the D.C. Circuit recently rejected EFF’s \n8 contrary arguments and held that an OLC memorandum conveying legal advice regarding the \n9 FBI’s authority to employ a certain investigative method is protected by the deliberative process \n10 privilege.  See Elec. Frontier Found. v. Dep’t of Justice, 739 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (reh’g \n11 en banc denied per curiam March 11, 2014). 6  There, EFF contended that the OLC memorandum \n12 at issue was not protected by the deliberative process privilege because it served as the “working \n13 law” of the agency receiving the advice.  Id. at 9.  The court, however, concluded that the OLC \n14 memorandum was not the “working law” of the client agency “[b]ecause OLC cannot speak \n15 authoritatively on the FBI’s policy.”  Id.  Instead, the memorandum “amounts to advice offered \n16 by OLC for consideration by officials of the FBI.  Such a memorandum is not the law of an \n17 agency unless the agency adopts it.”  Id. at 8. \n18   This is so even where the legal advice in question may be authoritative.  See id. at \n19 9 (“EFF argues that the OLC Opinion must be ‘working law’ because it is controlling \n20 (insofar as agencies customarily follow OLC advice that they request), precedential, and \n21 can be withdrawn.  That the OLC Opinion bears these indicia of a binding legal decision \n22 does not overcome the fact that OLC does not speak with authority on the FBI’s policy.”)  \n23 As another court explained, an argument to the contrary  \n \n24\n                            \n25 6 See also, e.g., N.Y. Times Co., 2013 WL 20543, at *23 (holding “Exemption 5 plainly applies” \nto, inter alia, OLC memo); Elec. Frontier Found. v. Dep’t of Justice, Civ. No. 11-939, 2012 WL \n26\n4319901, at *7 (D.D.C. Sept. 21, 2012) (OLC opinion protected by deliberative process privilege \nbecause it constitutes advice used by agency decisionmakers); Southam News v. INS, 674 F. \n27\nSupp. 881, 886 (D.D.C.1987) (OLC opinion letters “generated in the course of formulating \n28 policies and positions that were being considered” fall within the deliberative process privilege) \n(internal quotation omitted). \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    20 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page29 of 33\n \nis utterly without merit.  It is nonsensical to state that legal opinions can never be \n1\nprotected by the deliberative process privilege because of their authoritative \n2 nature.  If legal opinions are disclosable simply because they are authoritative or \nconclusive, this ‘would mean that virtually all legal advice OLC provides to the \n3 executive branch would be subject to disclosure.’  This would significantly chill \nthe ability of the executive branch to obtain legal advice.”   \n4\n \n5\nElec. Privacy Info. Ctr., 584 F. Supp. 2d at 75-76 (quoting CREW, 249 F.R.D. at 6).   \n6\n  Here, the Department of Commerce faced a decision on the formulation of a \n7\npolicy on how to respond to potential requests from government officials for census \n8\ninformation.  As Mr. Colborn explained in his declaration, “OLC does not purport to \n9\nmake policy decisions, and in fact lacks authority to make such decisions.  OLC’s legal \n10\nadvice and analysis may inform the decision-making of Executive Branch officials on \n11\nmatters of policy, but OLC’s legal advice does not dictate the policy choice to be made.”  \n12\nColborn Decl. ¶ 2.  Rather, the memorandum “was prepared by OLC to aid the \n13\nDepartment of Commerce in considering what actions to take, consistent with the \n14\nagency’s legal obligations, with respect to the potential disclosure of census information \n15\nto federal law enforcement or national security officers.”  Id. ¶ 15.  Just as “OLC is not \n16\nauthorized to make decisions about the FBI’s investigative policy,” EFF v. DOJ, 739 \n17\nF.3d at 9, it lacks authority to make decisions about the Department of Commerce’s \n18\npolicy with respect to disclosure of census information.  OLC’s legal advice thus is not \n19\nthe “working law” of the Department of Commerce; rather, OLC advice is an input to an \n20\nExecutive Branch decisionmaking process whose protection is at the core of the \n21\ndeliberative process privilege.  See Sears, 421 U.S. at 150-51.  Defendant therefore \n22\nproperly withheld the OLC legal advice memorandum under FOIA Exemption 5.     \n \n23\nD.  The Government Has Properly Withheld Information Subject To Exemption \n24 7(E) \n25 Exemption 7(E) protects from disclosure information compiled for law enforcement \n26 purposes where release of the information “would disclose techniques and procedures for law \n27 enforcement investigations or prosecutions,” or where it would “disclose guidelines for law \n28 enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    21 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page30 of 33\n \n1 risk circumvention of the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E).  Congress intended that Exemption \n2 7(E) protect from disclosure techniques and procedures used to prevent and protect against \n3 crimes as well as techniques and procedures used to investigate crimes after they have been \n4 committed.  See, e.g., PHE, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 983 F.2d 248, 250-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993) \n5 (holding that portions of FBI manual describing patterns of violations, investigative techniques, \n6 and sources of information available to investigators were protected by Exemption 7(E)).  See \n7 also Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, --- U.S. ----, 131 S. Ct. 1259, 1272-73 (2011) (Alito, J., concurring) \n8 (stating that “Particularly in recent years, terrorism prevention and national security measures \n9 have been recognized as vital to effective law enforcement efforts in our Nation[;]” also stating \n10 that “‘law enforcement purposes’” under FOIA Exemption 7 “involve more than just \n11 investigation and prosecution,” and that “security measures are critical to effective law \n12 enforcement as we know it.”). \n13 To determine if Exemption 7(E) applies, the Court must determine whether the records \n14 were “compiled for law enforcement purposes” within the meaning of FOIA.  Rosenfeld v. \n15 United States Dep’t of Justice, 57 F.3d 803, 808 (9th Cir. 1995).  To satisfy this threshold \n16 requirement, the government need only demonstrate that the records were compiled pursuant to \n17 authorized law enforcement duties of a law enforcement agency.  See Lewis v. IRS, 823 F.2d \n18 375, 379 (9th Cir. 1987); Wilkinson v. FBI, 633 F. Supp. 336, 343 (C.D. Cal. 1986); Church of \n19 Scientology v. Dep’t of Army, 611 F.2d 738, 748 (9th Cir. 1979).  Accord Milner, 131 S. Ct. at \n20 1272 (law enforcement purposes within the meaning of Exemption 7 include national security \n21 measures).  The Ninth Circuit accords special deference to law enforcement agencies in an \n22 Exemption 7 threshold determination.  Binion v. Dep’t of Justice, 695 F.2d 1189, 1194 (9th Cir. \n23 1983).  Thus, an agency with a clear law enforcement mandate need only establish a “rational \n24 nexus” between its law enforcement duties and the document for which Exemption 7 is claimed.  \n25 Id. at 1193-1194; Church of Scientology, 611 F.2d at 748; MacPherson v. IRS, 803 F.2d 479 (9th \n26 Cir. 1986) (citing Binion, 695 F.2d at 1194).  “The rational nexus test requires courts to accord a \n27 degree of deference to a law enforcement agency’s decisions to investigate.”  Rosenfeld, 57 F.3d \n28 at 808.  See also Keys v. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d 337, 340 (D.C. Cir. 1987).   \nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    22 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page31 of 33\n \n1 Plaintiff requested only information related to Section 215, a tool used by the FBI (a \n2 component of defendant which is indisputably a law enforcement agency) to obtain business \n3 record information pursuant to a court order and as part of authorized national security \n4 investigations, sometimes to be shared with the NSA.  The rational nexus to “law enforcement \n5 purposes” under FOIA is clear.  See id.; Milner, 131 S. Ct. at 1272.  Accordingly, plaintiff’s \n6 request necessitates review under Exemption 7(E). \n7 The government has asserted Exemption 7(E) to protect a certain confidential law \n8 enforcement technique used by the Intelligence Community in national security investigations, \n9 and details concerning that technique.  See Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 115-117.  Although Ms. Hudson \n10 discusses the harm that could reasonably be expected to flow from public release of this \n11 information, id. ¶ 117, such techniques and procedures are categorically protected by the \n12 Exemption, without any need for inquiry into the harm that would result from their disclosure.  \n13 Fisher v. Dep’t of Justice, 772 F. Supp. 7, 12 n.9 (D.D.C. 1991), aff’d, 968 F.2d 92 (D.C. Cir. \n14 1992) (unpublished table decision).  See also ACLU Found. v. Dep’t of Justice, 833 F. Supp. \n15 399, 407 (S.D.N.Y. 1993). \n16 Accordingly, the Court should grant summary judgment for the government as to its \n17 Exemption 7(E) withholdings.  \n \n18\nE.  The Government Has Properly Withheld Information Subject To Exemption \n7(A) \n19\n  The government has also properly withheld information relating to a pending national \n20\nsecurity investigation pursuant to Exemption 7(A).  That exemption authorizes withholding of \n21\nrecords compiled for law enforcement purposes, the disclosure of which “could reasonably be \n22\nexpected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A).  To satisfy its \n23\nburden justifying the applicability of this exemption, the government need only demonstrate that \n24\n(1) a law enforcement proceeding is pending or prospective, and (2) release of the information \n25\ncould reasonably be expected to cause some articulable harm to the proceeding.  See Robbins \n26\nTire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. at 224.  See also, e.g., id. at 232 (“[T]he release of information in \n27\ninvestigatory files prior to the completion of an actual, contemplated enforcement proceeding \n28\nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    23 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page32 of 33\n \n1 was precisely the kind of interference that Congress continued to want to protect against.”).  And \n2 the applicability of Exemption 7(A) may be demonstrated generically, based on the category of \n3 records involved. See Robbins Tire, 437 U.S. at 236; Lewis, 823 F.2d at 380 (Exemption 7(A) is \n4 a categorical “general exclusion”).   \n5   Information subject to Exemption 7(A) is redacted from a FISC Supplemental Order in \n6 docket B.R. 10-82 dated November 23, 2010.  Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 93-96.  As Ms. Hudson states, it \n7 concerns a still-pending FBI counterterrorism investigation of a single subject , id. ¶ 93, and that \n8 the redacted information could, if disclosed, reasonably be expected to interfere with the FBI’s \n9 investigation and/or any eventual prosecution by alerting the target of the investigation, id. ¶ 95.  \n10 Should the Court require further detail than Ms. Hudson is able to provide on the public record, it \n11 is contained in her classified declaration.  See id.; Classified Hudson Decl.   \n \n12 F.   Defendants Have Produced All Reasonably Segregable Portions of \nResponsive Records \n13\nFOIA requires that “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to \n14\nany person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this \n15\nsubsection.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(9).  This provision does not require disclosure of records in \n16\nwhich the non-exempt information that remains is meaningless. See Nat’l Sec. Archive Fund, \n17\nInc. v. CIA, 402 F. Supp. 2d 211, 220-21 (D.D.C. 2005) (concluding that no reasonably \n18\nsegregable information exists because “the non-exempt information would produce only \n19\nincomplete, fragmented, unintelligible sentences composed of isolated, meaningless words.”); \n20\nsee also Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. Dep’t of Interior, Civ. No. 07-325-CL, 2007 WL \n21\n4180685, at *8 (D. Or. Nov. 21, 2007) (“In cases where nonexempt material is inextricably \n22\nintertwined with exempt material and the deletion of the exempt material would leave only \n23\nmeaningless words and phrases, the entire document is exempt.”).  The defendant has reviewed \n24\nthe withheld material and have disclosed all non-exempt information that reasonably could be \n25\ndisclosed.  See Hudson Decl. ¶¶ 118-122, Colborn Decl. ¶ 15.  Accordingly, the Department of \n26\nJustice has produced all “reasonably segregable portion[s]” of the responsive records.  5 U.S.C. \n27\n§ 552(b).   \n28\nCase No. 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \nDefendant’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment    24 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document77   Filed03/28/14   Page33 of 33\n \n1 Nor is the legal analysis contained in the FISC opinions and orders at issue somehow per \n2 se segregable, as plaintiff has argued before.  Legal analysis protected by Exemption 1, 3, 5, or 7 \n3 (or any other Exemption) of the FOIA need not be produced to a requester.  To find otherwise \n4 would allow the forced disclosure of information despite a court’s own acknowledgement that \n5 such disclosure would cause the national security harm and expose sensitive intelligence sources \n6 and methods.  However, the law is clear that “[t]he Court’s role with regard to Exemption 1 is \n7 only to review the sufficiency and reasonableness of the agency’s explanation for its \n8 classification decision, giving the agency’s determination the heightened deference it is due \n9 under the law.”  People for the Am. Way Fund. v. NSA, 462 F. Supp. 2d 21, 33 (D.D.C.  2006).  \n10 See also ACLU v. Dep’t of Justice, 265 F. Supp. 2d  20, 31 (D.D.C. 2003) (“That the public has a \n11 significant and entirely legitimate desire for th[e] information simply does not, in an Exemption \n12 1 case, alter the analysis.”).  Similarly, “the sole issue for decision” on an Exemption 3 claim “is \n13 the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statute’s \n14 coverage.”  Fitzgibbon, 911 F.2d at 761-62.  Cf. Sears, 421 U.S. at 161 (if a document \n15 constitutes “working law” and therefore cannot be withheld under Exemption 5, it “may be \n16 withheld only on the ground that it falls within the coverage of some exemption other than \n17 Exemption 5.”). \n18 The government has, therefore, produced all reasonably segregable portions of the \n19 responsive records. \n20 CONCLUSION \n21   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant defendant’s Motion for Summary \n22 Judgment and enter judgment for the Department of Justice.   \n \n23\nDated: March 28, 2014      Respectfully submitted, \n \n24\n            STUART F.

Senator s Wyden and Udall co-sponsored an amendment to the reauthorization of the \n3 \nPatriot Act. The amendment would have required government officials to \"not secretly reinterpret \n4 \npublic law s and statutes in a manner that is inconsistent with the public's understanding of these \n5 \nlaws, and [to ] not describe the execution of these laws in a way that misinforms or misleads the \n6 \npublic.\" S.A . 339 to S. 1038 , 112th Cong. § 3 (2011). The amendment would have also required \n7 \nthe Attorney General to publish \"the legal basis for the intelligence collection activities described \n8 \nin [a ] February 2 , 2011 repor t [fro m the Attorney Genera l and Director of National Intelligenc e \n9 \nregarding intelligenc e collection authoritie s scheduled to expire under Sectio n 22 4 of the Patrio t \n10 \nAct].\" Id. Again, over the objection of Senators briefed on the government's interpretation and use \n11 \nof Section 215, the three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act were extended until 2014. \n12 \n13.

Expedition is also warranted because the request involves a “matter of \n26 \nwidespread  and  exceptional  media  interest  in  which  there  exist  possible  questions  about  the \n27 \ngovernment’s integrity which affect public confidence.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(II); 28 C.F.R. \n28 \n \n  -1-   \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT           CASE NO. 11-CV-5221 DMR   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Case4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document9   Filed11/03/11   Page2 of 11\n \n1 \n§ 16.5(d)(1)(iv). Therefore, Plaintiff is statutorily entitled to the expedited treatment it seeks. \n2 \nPARTIES \n3 \n2.  Plaintiff  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation  (EFF)  is  a  not-for-profit  corporation \n4 \nestablished under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with offices in San Francisco, \n5 \nCalifornia and Washington, D.C.  EFF is a donor-supported membership organization that works to \n6 \ninform policymakers and the general public about civil liberties issues related to technology and to \n7 \nact as a defender of those liberties.  In support of its mission, EFF uses the FOIA to obtain and \n8 \ndisseminate information concerning the activities of federal agencies.    \n9 \n3.  Defendant Department of Justice (DOJ) is a Department of the Executive Branch of \n10 \nthe United States Government. DOJ is an “agency” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). The \n11 \nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC), Office of Information Policy (OIP),1 National Security Division \n12 \n(NSD), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are components of Defendant DOJ. \n13 \nJURISDICTION  \n14 \n4.  This  Court  has  both  subject  matter  jurisdiction  over  this  action  and  personal \n15 \njurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i).  \n  16 \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.   \n17 \nVENUE AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n18 \n5.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  district  under  5  U.S.C.  §  552(a)(4)(B)  and  28  U.S.C. \n19 \n§ 1391(e). \n20 \n6.  Assignment to the San Francisco division is proper pursuant to Local Rule 3-2(c) \n21 \nand (d) because a substantial portion of the events giving rise to this action occurred in this district \n22 \nand division, where Plaintiff is headquartered. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n1  The  Office  of  Information  Policy  has  primary  responsibility  for  handling  FOIA  requests \n26 \nsubmitted to the Office of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and Associate Attorney \n27  General, as well as the Office of Legislative Affairs and the Office of Legal Policy. By letter dated \nJune 29, 2011, Office of Legal Policy informed Plaintiff that it had no records responsive to \n28  Plaintiff’s request. Thus, Plaintiff’s complaint does not include the Office of Legal Policy.   \n \n  -2-   \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT           CASE NO. 11-CV-5221 DMR   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Case4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document9   Filed11/03/11   Page3 of 11\n \n1  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \n2  Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act \n3  7.  Since its passage in 2001, the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”), Pub. L. \n4  No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (codified in various sections), has engendered controversy. In particular, \n5  the government’s use of one provision — Section 215 — has consistently sparked concern among \n6  elected officials, civil liberties advocates, and citizens.  \n7  8.  Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n8  Act (“FISA”), Pub. L. No. 95-511, 92 Stat. 1783 (codified in §§ 50 U.S.C. 1801 - 1885) provides \n9  the FBI with the power to obtain a court order for “any tangible thing” upon certification that the \n10  requested  items  are  “relevant  to  an  authorized  [counterintelligence  or  counterterrorism] \n11  investigation.” 50 U.S.C. § 1861(a)(1), (b)(2)(A). Section 215 — along with Section 206 (the \n12  “roving wiretap” provision) of the Patriot Act and the “lone wolf” provision of the Intelligence \n13  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 — was initially schedule to sunset in 2005, but, \n14  after brief extensions, was subsequently reauthorized for four additional years. \n15  9.  In 2009, DOJ attorneys publicly disclosed that Section 215 orders were being used \n  16  to support a “sensitive collection program.” Statement of Todd Hinnen, Deputy Assistant Attorney \n17  General, House Judiciary Committee, “The USA PATRIOT Act,” (September 22, 2009).2  Shortly \n18  after this disclosure, elected officials briefed on the government’s interpretation of Section 215 \n19  began to question the legitimacy of the government’s use of its expanded Patriot Act powers. \n20  Senator  Richard  Durbin,  a  member  of  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee,  stated  that  the \n21  government’s use of “Section 215 is unfortunately cloaked in secrecy. Some day that cloak will be \n22  lifted, and future generations will ask whether our actions today meet the test of a democratic \n23  society: transparency, accountability, and fidelity to the rule of law and our Constitution.” Remarks \n24  of Sen. Richard Durbin, Senate Judiciary Committee “Executive Business Meeting,” (October 1, \n25  2009). 3 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  2 Available at http://www.justice.gov/ola/testimony/111-1/2009-09-22-nsd-hinnen-patriot-act.pdf \n3 Available at http://judiciary.senate.gov/resources/webcasts/index.cfm?changedate=09-28-\n28  09&p=all (beginning at 68:00).  \n \n  -3-   \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT           CASE NO. 11-CV-5221 DMR   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Case4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document9   Filed11/03/11   Page4 of 11\n \n1 \n10.  Similarly,  then-Senator  Russ  Feingold,  a  member  of  both  the  Senate  Judiciary \n2 \nCommittee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, stated: there “is information about the \n3 \nuse of Section 215 orders that I believe Congress and the American people deserve to know . . . \n4 \nbefore we decide whether and in what form to extend these authorities, Congress and the American \n5 \npeople deserve to know at least basic information about how they have been used.” Statement of \n6 \nSen. Russ Feingold, Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing, “Reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act: \n7 \nEnsuring  Liberty  and  Security,”  September  23,  2009.4  Despite  the  Senators’  admonitions, \n8 \nSection 215 was reauthorized until 2011. \n9 \n11.  In May 2011, during truncated debate on the reauthorization of the three expiring \n10 \nprovisions, two Senators on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence again voiced concerns \n11 \nabout the government’s use of 215 orders. In an interview, Senator Ron Wyden stated that he was \n12 \n“extremely interested in reforming [Section 215]” and that “the public has a right to public debate \n13 \nabout” the government’s interpretation and use of Section 215. Spencer Ackerman, There’s a \n14 \nSecret Patriot Act, Senator Says, WIRED (May 27, 2011).5 Then, in a speech on the Senate floor, \n15 \nSenator Wyden declared:  \n  16 \nI want to deliver a warning this afternoon: when the American people find out \n17  how  their  government  has  secretly  interpreted  the  Patriot  Act,  they  will  be \nstunned and they will be angry. . . . The fact is that anyone can read the plain text \n18  of the Patriot Act, and yet many members of Congress have no idea how the law \nis being secretly interpreted by the executive branch[.]  \n19 \nStatement of Sen. Ron Wyden, On Patriot Act Reauthorization (May 26, 2011).6 Senator Mark \n20 \nUdall echoed similar concerns about the scope of Section 215: “Congress is granting powers to the \n21 \nExecutive  Branch  that  lead  to  abuse,  and  frankly  shield  the  Executive  Branch  from \n22 \naccountability . . . I cannot believe that we are once again being rushed into rubber-stamp policies \n23 \nthat threaten the liberty of the American people.”  Statement of Sen. Mark Udall, On Patriot Act \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n4 Available at \nhttp://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=e655f9e2809e5476862f735da1501403&wit\n26 \n_id=e655f9e2809e5476862f735da1501403-0-1.   \n27  5Available at http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/05/secret-patriot-act/.    \n6 Available at http://wyden.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=34eddcdb-2541-42f5-8f1d-\n28  19234030d91e.   \n \n  -4-   \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT           CASE NO. 11-CV-5221 DMR   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Case4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document9   Filed11/03/11   Page5 of 11\n \n1 \nReauthorization (May 26, 2011).7  \n2 \n12.  Senators Wyden and Udall co-sponsored an amendment to the reauthorization of the \n3 \nPatriot Act. The amendment would have required government officials to “not secretly reinterpret \n4 \npublic laws and statutes in a manner that is inconsistent with the public’s understanding of these \n5 \nlaws, and [to] not describe the execution of these laws in a way that misinforms or misleads the \n6 \npublic.” S.A. 339 to S. 1038, 112th Cong. § 3 (2011). The amendment would have also required \n7 \nthe Attorney General to publish “the legal basis for the intelligence collection activities described \n8 \nin [a] February 2, 2011 report [from the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence \n9 \nregarding intelligence collection authorities scheduled to expire under Section 224 of the Patriot \n10 \nAct].”  Id.  Again, over the objection of Senators briefed on the government’s interpretation and \n11 \nuse of Section 215, the three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act were extended until 2014. \n12 \n13.  On September 21, 2011, Senators Wyden and Udall sent a joint letter to Attorney \n13 \nGeneral Eric Holder describing the DOJ’s pattern of “misleading statements pertaining to the \n14 \ngovernment’s interpretation” of Section 215. Letter from Sens. Wyden and Udall to Attorney \n15 \nGeneral  Eric  Holder  (Sept.  21,  2011).8  The  Senators  expressed  particular  concern  with \n  16 \nrepresentations made by the DOJ analogizing the use of Section 215 to grand jury subpoenas, as \n17 \nwell as with DOJ statements denying that Section 215 had not been subject to a secret legal \n18 \ninterpretation by the DOJ. Id. The Senators closed by urging DOJ to “avoid a negative public \n19 \nreaction and erosion of confidence in US intelligence agencies” by “initiat[ing] an informed public \n20 \ndebate about these authorities today.”  Id.     \n21 \nPlaintiff’s FOIA Requests and Requests for Expedited Processing \n22 \n14.  In letters dated June 2, 2011 and sent by email to the OLC, OIP, NSD, and FBI, \n23 \nPlaintiff requested under the FOIA all agency records (including, but not limited to, electronic \n24 \nrecords) created from January 1, 2004 to the present discussing, concerning, or reflecting the DOJ \n25 \nor any of its component’s interpretation or use of Section 215, including: \n26   \n27                                                   \n7 Available at http://markudall.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1090.   \n28  8 Available at http://wyden.senate.gov/download/?id=a3670ed3-9f65-4740-b72e-061c7de83f75. \n \n  -5-   \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT           CASE NO. 11-CV-5221 DMR   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Case4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document9   Filed11/03/11   Page6 of 11\n \n1  (1)  All reports, memoranda, guidance, presentations, legal briefs, emails, \nor any other record describing the types of “tangible things” which the \n2 \nDOJ or any of its components has sought or has the authority to seek \nthrough Section 215 orders, whether “pure” or “combination” orders \n3 \n(i.e., a 215 order made in conjunction with a pen register/trap and \n4  trace order); \n \n5  (2)  All reports, memoranda, guidance, presentations, legal briefs, emails, \nor any other record related to the use of Section 215 orders to further \n6 \nany “sensitive collection program;” \n \n7 \n(3)  All reports, memoranda, guidance, presentations, legal briefs, emails, \n8  or any other record relating to the scope of the FBI’s authority under \nSection 215 or the legal basis for “sensitive collection programs” \n9  supported by Section 215 orders, including any briefings provided to \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence or the Senate Judiciary \n10 \nCommittee, including the February 2, 2011 report; \n \n11 \n(4)  All reports, memoranda, guidance, presentations, legal briefs, emails, \n12  or  any  other  record  related  to  modifications  by  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court to applications for Section 215 orders \n13 \nsubmitted by the FBI; \n \n14 \n(5)  All reports, memoranda, guidance, presentations, legal briefs, emails, \nor any other record related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n15 \nCourt’s  refusal  to  grant  any  applications  for  Section  215  orders \n  16  submitted by the FBI; \n \n17 \n(6)  All reports, memoranda, guidance, presentations, legal briefs, emails, \nor any other record related to the FBI’s withdrawal of any applications \n18 \nfor  Section  215  orders  from  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance \n19  Court; \n \n20  (7)  All reports, memoranda, guidance, presentation, legal briefs, emails or \nany other record related to the number of U.S. persons identified as \n21 \nsubjects in Section 215 orders and the number of non-U.S. persons \nidentified as subjects in Section 215 orders; \n22 \n \n23  (8)  Copies of any invoices, receipts, bills, or any other similar document \nsent  to  the  FBI  by  any  business  or  organization  in  order  to  be \n24  reimbursed for the cost of compliance with a Section 215 order.   \n25  15.  In its June 2 letters, Plaintiff also formally requested that the processing of these \n26  requests be expedited because they pertain to information about which there is “[a]n urgency to \n27  inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity,” and the requests were \n28  “made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I), \n \n  -6-   \n  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT           CASE NO. 11-CV-5221 DMR   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  Case4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document9   Filed11/03/11   Page7 of 11\n \n1 \n(v)(II);  28  C.F.R.  §  16.5(d)(1)(ii).

Plaintiff further requested a waiver of all fees \n5 \nassociated with the processing of the request because EFF is a representative of the news media, \n6 \npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and 28 C.F.R. §16.22(b)(6), (d)(1), and because the \n7 \nrequest  was  in  the  public  interest,  pursuant  to  5  U.S.C.  §  552(a)(4)(A)(iii)  and  28  C.F.R. \n8 \n§ 16.11(k)(1).  \n9 \nOLC’s Response to Plaintiff’s FOIA Request \n10 \n16.

NOS. 77 AND 79) \nourt  ornia  12  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,        \nC if 13  \nt  al  Defendant. \nc C\nstri of  14\nDi t \nc Presently before the Court are the renewed cross-motions for summary judgment on the claim \ns  ri 15\ne t\nStat  Dis 16 of plaintiff Electronic Frontier Foundation (“EFF” or “Plaintiff”) under the Freedom of Information \nd  rn\ne e Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 522.  EFF alleges that defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is \nt h 17\nni rt\nU o\nN 18 withholding agency records without legitimate justification under any of the limited exemptions in \nthe statute.  (Dkt. Nos. 77 and 79.)  DOJ responds that information concerning the details of a \n19\ngovernment counter-terrorism program undertaken pursuant to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT \n20\nAct, 50 U.S.C. § 1861(a)(1), (“Section 215”), including the documents sought by EFF containing \n21\nsignificant legal interpretation of the government’s authority under Section 215, is exempt from \n22\ndisclosure under FOIA.  \n23\nBy way of background, the parties previously filed and argued cross-motions for summary \n24\njudgment, and supplemented briefing as to the sufficiency of the public identification of the \n25\ndocuments withheld and the basis therefor in response to this Court’s order.  While those cross-\n26\nmotions were still pending, certain classified information was the subject of unauthorized \n27\ndisclosures, widely reported in the press.  These unauthorized disclosures led to the government’s \n28\ndeclassification and production of hundreds of pages of formerly highly classified documents that \n \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page2 of 13\n \n1 discuss, among other things, the collection of telephony metadata pursuant to Section 215 of the \n2 USA PATRIOT Act (“the call record collection program”).  Apparently among the declassified \n3 documents were many documents responsive to EFF’s FOIA request and previously withheld.   \n4 The parties agreed that further summary judgment briefing would be necessary to resolve the \n5 propriety of the remaining withholdings.  Pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, the Court ordered that \nfurther summary judgment briefing would be based on a “representative sample” of withheld \n6\nrecords.  (See Stipulation at Dkt. No. 71; Order at Dkt. No. 72.)  In its opposition and cross-motion, \n7\nEFF further narrowed its challenge to DOJ’s: (1) withholding, in full, of any opinion or order of the \n8\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”); (2) withholding of the names of \n9\ntelecommunication service providers participating in the call record collection program under \n10\nSection 215; and (3) withholding, in full, of a formal opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel \n11\n(“OLC”) described in the Declaration of Paul P. Colborn (Dkt. No. 77-5) as a memorandum provided \n12\na \nrt  ni 13 to the Department of Commerce dated January 4, 2010 regarding “the interaction between disclosure \nu r\no o\nC if in the Patriot Act, as amended, and prohibitions in the Census Act.” (Id. at ¶ 13 [describing the \nt  al 14\nc C\nDistri t of  15 document referred to hereinafter as “the Census Memorandum”].)  \nc\nes  tri The Court has thoroughly reviewed the parties’ submissions and heard oral argument on the \ntat Dis 16\nd S rn  17 new cross-motions for summary judgment.  The Court has also conducted an in camera review of the \ne e\nt h\nni rt ex parte, classified version of the declaration of Jennifer L. Hudson, the ex parte Declaration by the \nU o 18\nN\nChief of Operations, Office of Intelligence, National Security Division, Department of Justice (“the \n19\nNSD Declaration”) concerning DOJ’s use of the Census Memorandum, and certain documents at \n20\nissue in the cross-motions, specifically:  \n21\n(1) FISC opinion dated 8/20/2008 (6 pages);  \n22\n(2) FISC order dated 10/31/2006 (19 pages); \n23\n(3) FISC orders dated 2/17/2006 (17 pages); \n24\n(4) FISC orders dated 2/24/2006 (8 pages); \n25\n(5) FISC orders dated 12/16/2005 (16 pages); \n26\n(6) the Census Memorandum and the related application of the Department of Justice in  \n27\n      connection with which the Census Memorandum was submitted to the FISC. \n28\n2 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page3 of 13\n \n1 (See Dkt. No. 77-2, Vaughn Index, at 1-3, Doc. No. 14A, 86J, 89D, 89K, 89S; see also Order dated \n2 June 13, 2014, Dkt. No. 85, and Ordered dated July 24, 2014, Dkt. No. 88.)  \n3 Having carefully considered the papers and arguments submitted, and for the reasons set forth \n4 below, the Court hereby Orders that the cross-motions are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  \n5 DOJ has established a proper basis for withholding, in full, the FISC orders and opinions at issue, \n6 and for withholding all names of telecommunications providers participating in the Call Records \n7 Collection Program, under FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3.  Thus, summary judgment is GRANTED in \n8 favor of DOJ on the claim for disclosure of this information.  However, DOJ has not established that \n9 the Census Memorandum is properly withheld under Exemption 5, and EFF is GRANTED summary \n10 judgment on its claim for FOIA violation as to this document.  \n11 I.   APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS \n12 FOIA safeguards the public’s ability to hold the government accountable for its actions.  \na \nrt  ni 13 Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989); NLRB v. \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978).   FOIA requires disclosure of all agency \nc C\nDistri t of  15 records at the request of the public unless the records fall within one of nine narrow exemptions. See \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 5 U.S.C. § 552(b); see also Minier v. CIA, 88 F.3d 796, 800 (9th Cir. 1996).  These “limited \nd S rn  17 exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 the Act.”  Dep’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8 (2001) (internal \nN\n19 citation omitted).  The exemptions “have been consistently given a narrow compass,” and agency \n20 records that “do not fall within one of the exemptions are improperly withheld.” Dep’t of Justice v. \n21 Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 151 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n22 The exemptions invoked with respect to the documents at issue here are those allowing the \n23 government to withhold matters disclosing information:  \n  “specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept \n24\nsecret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy” when properly classified \n25 as such (Exemption 1, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1));  \n \n26   specifically exempted from disclosure by other federal statutes if the statute \nestablishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to the particular types of \n27\nmaterial to be withheld. (Exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3));  \n28  \n3 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page4 of 13\n \n  constituting “inter-agency or intra-agency” records not otherwise available “by law \n1\nto a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency” (Exemption 5, 5 \n2 U.S.C. § 522(b)(5));  \n \n3   concerning “procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions…if \nsuch disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.”  \n4\n(Exemption 7E, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E)).1 \n5\nThe Court addresses each exemption in turn.  \n6\nUnder Exemption 1, material that has been properly classified is exempt from disclosure. \n7\nWeinberger v. Catholic Action of Hawaii, 454 U.S. 139, 144-45 (1981).  For information to be \n8\nproperly classified pursuant to Exemption 1, it must meet the requirements of Executive Order \n9\n13,526, “Classified National Security Information,” 75 Fed. Reg. 707 (Dec. 29, 2009): \n10  \n(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information; \n11\n(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the \nUnited States Government; \n12\na  (3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of information listed \nrt  ni 13 in section 1.4 of this order; and \nu r\no o\nC if (4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized \nct  Cal 14 disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in \nDistri t of  15 damage to the national security, which includes defense against transnational \nc terrorism, and the original classification authority is able to identify or \ns  ri\ne t\ntat Dis 16 describe the damage. \nd S rn  17 Id. § 1.1, 75 Fed. Reg. at 707.  The Executive Order lists three classification levels for national \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 security information: top secret, secret, and confidential. Id. § 1.2, 75 Fed. Reg. at 707-08.   \nN\n19 Under Exemption 3, “the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the \n20 inclusion of withheld material within the statute’s coverage.”  Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 761-\n21\n                                                 \n22 1  As to certain withheld FISC Orders, the government also invoked Exemptions 6 and 7C in \nits Vaughn index (Dkt. No. 77-2).  Those exemptions concern records that would, if disclosed, \n23\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  5 U.S.C. § 522(b)(6) and 522(b)(7)(C).  EFF \n24 does not challenge the portions withheld on those grounds.  (See Mtn. at n.2, Dkt. No. 77.)  Because \nthe Court finds that the documents are properly withheld under Exemptions 1, 3 and 7(E), this \n25\ndecision does not reach the propriety of the government’s withholding under Exemptions 6 and 7C.   \nAlthough not listed in its Vaughn index with respect to the narrowed set of documents at \n26\nissue in the motion, DOJ’s brief indicates that it is also withholding documents under Exemption \n27 7(A), interference with an ongoing national security investigation.  5 U.S.C. § 522(b)(7)(A); see \nMotion at p. 2:13-14, 23:18-24:11.).  Because the Court finds the other exemptions support \n28\nwithholding and this exemption was not invoked particularly as to the documents now at issue, the \nCourt need not reach the merits of withholding pursuant to Exemption 7(A).  \n4 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page5 of 13\n \n1 62 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  Congress included Exemption 3 to recognize the existence of collateral statutes \n2 that limit the disclosure of information held by the government, and to incorporate such statutes \n3 within FOIA’s exemptions.  See Balridge v. Shapiro, 455 U.S. 345, 352-53 (1982); Essential Info., \n4 Inc. v. U.S. Info. Agency, 134 F.3d 1165, 1166 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Here, DOJ relies on two other \n5 statutes to support withholding: (1) the National Security Act of 1947, as amended by the \n6 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, 50 U.S.C. § 403-1(i), which protects \n7 intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure; and (2) Section 6 of the National \n8 Security Agency Act of 1959, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 3605, which provides that “[n]othing in this \n9 Act or any other law . . . shall be construed to require the disclosure of the organization or any \n10 function of the National Security Agency, or any information with respect to the activities \n11 thereof….”  \n12 Exemption 5 shields from disclosure “those documents, and only those documents [that are] \na \nrt  ni 13 normally privileged in the civil discovery context,” such as under the deliberative process privilege, \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 attorney-client privilege, or attorney work-product privilege.  NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 \nc C\nDistri t of  15 U.S. 132, 149 (1975) (“Sears”); see also Carter v. Dep’t of Commerce, 307 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 Cir. 2002).  Under Exemption 5, the deliberative process privilege extends to those documents that \nd S rn  17 are both “predecisional” and “deliberative.” See Carter, 307 F.3d at 1089.  Documents covered by \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 Exemption 5 include those “reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations \nN\n19 comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.”  Sears, \n20 421 U.S. at 150.  Agencies may invoke the deliberative process privilege: (1) to encourage open, \n21 frank discussions on matters of policy between subordinates and superiors; (2) to protect against \n22 premature disclosure of proposed policies before they are finally adopted; and (3) to protect against \n23 public confusion that might result from disclosure of reasons and rationales that were not in fact \n24 ultimately the grounds for an agency’s action.  See Sears, 421 U.S. at 150-54.   \n25 Exemption 7(E) protects from disclosure techniques and procedures used to prevent and \n26 protect against crimes as well as techniques and procedures used to investigate crimes after they have \n27 been committed.  See, e.g., PHE, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 983 F.2d 248, 250-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993) \n28 (holding that portions of FBI manual describing patterns of violations, investigative techniques, and \n5 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page6 of 13\n \n1 sources of information available to investigators were protected by Exemption 7(E)).  To determine \n2 if Exemption 7(E) applies, the Court must determine whether the records were “compiled for law \n3 enforcement purposes” within the meaning of FOIA.  Rosenfeld v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 57 \n4 F.3d 803, 808 (9th Cir. 1995).  The Ninth Circuit accords special deference to law enforcement \n5 agencies in an Exemption 7 threshold determination.  Binion v. Dep’t of Justice, 695 F.2d 1189, 1194 \n6 (9th Cir. 1983).  Thus, an agency with a clear law enforcement mandate need only establish a \n7 “rational nexus” between its law enforcement duties and the document for which Exemption 7 is \n8 claimed.  Id. at 1193-1194; Church of Scientology of California v. U.S. Dep't of Army, 611 F.2d 738, \n9 748 (9th Cir. 1979); MacPherson v. IRS, 803 F.2d 479, 482 (9th Cir. 1986) (citing Binion, 695 F.2d \n10 at 1194).  \n11 FOIA disputes involving the propriety of agency withholdings are commonly resolved on \n12 summary judgment.  See, e.g., Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. U.S. Forest Service, 861 F.2d 1114, 1115 (9th \na \nrt  ni 13 Cir. 1988).  Summary judgment is proper when the moving party shows that “there is no genuine \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” F.R.C.P. 56 \nc C\nDistri t of  15 (a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 In FOIA cases, a court reviews the government’s decision to withhold records de novo, and \nd S rn  17 the government bears the burden of proving records have been properly withheld.  5 U.S.C. § \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 552(a)(4)(B); Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 755.  Even when the exemptions invoked raise national \nN\n19 security concerns, the court continues to have an “independent responsibility” to conduct a thorough \n20 de novo evaluation of the government’s withholdings.  Goldberg v. Dep’t of State, 818 F.2d 71, 76-\n21 77 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (noting Congress amended FOIA to clarify its “intent that courts act as an \n22 independent check on challenged classification decisions”).  The government bears the burden of \n23 demonstrating to a reviewing court that withheld information is “clearly exempt.”  Birch v. U.S. \n24 Postal Svc., 803 F.2d 1206, 1209 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (citing Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 823 (D.C. \n25 Cir. 1973)).  To satisfy that burden, the government “must provide a relatively detailed justification, \n26 specifically identifying the reasons why a particular exemption is relevant and correlating those \n27 claims with the particular part of a withheld document to which they apply.”  Mead Data Cent., Inc. \n28 v. Dep’t of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1977).   \n6 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page7 of 13\n \n1 Bearing these principles in mind, the Court turns to the responsive information withheld by \n2 DOJ and whether DOJ has established that the information may be withheld under the FOIA \n3 exemptions asserted.   \n4 II.   DISCUSSION  \n5 A.   Withholding In Full of FISC Opinions and Orders  \n6 DOJ has withheld certain FISC Orders and Opinions in full pursuant to Exemptions 1 and 3.  \n7 (Vaughn Index, Documents 14A, 86J, 89D, 89K, 89S).  With respect to a subset of these (Documents \n8 89D, 89K, and 89S), DOJ also asserts Exemption 7(E).   \n9 The Court finds DOJ’s showing, and the Court’s review of the documents themselves, \n10 supports withholding under these exemptions.  The FISC orders are properly withheld to protect \n11 intelligence sources and methods used by the government to gather intelligence data.  The orders \n12 discuss specific techniques authorized by the FISC, the details of the underlying investigations, and \na \nrt  ni 13 details concerning how the government operationally and technically implements the FISC-\nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 authorized techniques, which the government continues to employ.  Disclosure of the documents \nc C\nDistri t of  15 would reveal intelligence activities or methods described in the FISC orders could allow targets of \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 national security investigations to divine what information was collected when, as well as gaps in \nd S rn  17 surveillance, thus providing a roadmap for evading surveillance.  As set forth in the DOJ’s evidence, \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 the withheld information, in combination with already-public information, would allow targets of \nN\n19 government investigations to evade surveillance, thereby jeopardizing national security.  Moreover, \n20 based upon the Court’s review, the documents must be withheld in full and contain no reasonably \n21 segregable information.  Consequently, the documents are properly exempted from disclosure under \n22 Exemptions 1, 3 and 7(E).   \n \n23\nB.   Withholding of Names of Telecommunication Service Providers Participating \nin the Call Record Collection Program  \n24\nEFF withdrew its challenges as to most of the information withheld in those documents DOJ \n25\nreleased in part.  However, EFF continues to seek the identity of those telecommunications service \n26\nproviders who were ordered to produce their business records as part of the telephone records \n27\ncollection program.  \n28\n7 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page8 of 13\n \n1 DOJ offers evidence that disclosing which telecommunications companies assisted with NSA \n2 intelligence activities could lead to serious national security problems, since it could reveal which \n3 channels of communication may or may not be secure and thereby provide a roadmap for avoiding \n4 government surveillance for those who might plot activity such as terrorist attacks.  See Halkin v. \n5 Helms, 598 F.2d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (rejecting argument “that admission or denial of the fact of \n6 acquisition of [certain] communications…would not reveal which circuits NSA has targeted” as \n7 “naïve”).  \n8 EFF’s argument for disclosure does not question whether the information about the particular \n9 identities would implicate national security and investigation methods exemptions, but instead \n10 contends that this information has lost its exempt character because the providers’ names have been \n11 officially acknowledged, and any exemption for the information thereby waived.  See Fitzgibbon v. \n12 CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 765 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  More particularly, EFF argues that two government \na \nrt  ni 13 officials—Geoffrey Stone and Raj De—have publicly confirmed the participation of three \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 telecommunications companies in the NSA’s call records program.  As such, this “official \nc C\nDistri t of  15 acknowledgement” overcomes whatever otherwise valid exemption the government might assert. \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 The standard for official disclosure requires plaintiff to identify “an intentional, public \nd S rn  17 disclosure made by or at the request of a government officer acting in an authorized capacity by the \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 agency in control of the information at issue,” that is “‘as specific as the information previously \nN\n19 released.’”  See Pickard v. DOJ, 653 F.3d 782, 787, 786 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting, in part, Fitzgibbon, \n20 911 F.2d at 765).  “[A]lthough an agency bears the burden of proving that a FOIA exemption applies \n21 to a given document, a plaintiff asserting that information has been previously disclosed bears the \n22 initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain that duplicates that being \n23 withheld.”  Public Citizen v. Dep’t of State, 11 F.3d 198, 201 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (citing Afshar v. \n24 Department of State, 702 F.2d 1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1983)).  The test is a stringent one and presents \n25 a “high hurdle for a FOIA plaintiff...[as the] Government’s vital interest in information relating to \n26 national security and foreign affairs dictates that it must be.’” Public Citizen, 11 F.3d at 203. \n27 The Court finds that Plaintiff has not met its burden.  Neither of the two supposed “official \n28 acknowledgements” waived the exemptions asserted by DOJ.  The Court analyzes each:  \n8 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page9 of 13\n \n1 EFF first contends that statements by Geoffrey Stone, a former member of the federal \n2 government’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, disclosed the \n3 telecommunications providers’ identities.  Leaving aside the issue of whether Stone’s position as a \n4 member of that Review Group did or did not make him a “government official,” the timing of the \n5 statements shows that they were not made while he was acting in an authorized government capacity.  \n6 The statements at issue were made in an opinion piece in late March 2014, in which he stated that \n7 “telephone companies like Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T are required to turn over [records] to the \n8 NSA.”  Stone’s membership on the Review Group ended in January 2014.  Thus, he could not speak \n9 for any agency of the United States at that point.  Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc. v. Dep’t of \n10 Navy, 891 F.2d 414, 421-22 (2d Cir. 1989) (“Admiral Carroll’s statements cannot effect an official \n11 disclosure of information since he is no longer an active naval officer…Officials no longer serving \n12 with an executive branch department cannot continue to disclose official agency policy[.]”); Afshar, \na \nrt  ni 13 702 F.2d at 1133 (books written by former agency official did not constitute official disclosures); \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 Phillippi v. CIA, 655 F.2d 1325, 1331 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (statements by former CIA director that had \nc C\nDistri t of  15 been pre-cleared by agency for public disclosure do not constitute agency disclosure).   \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 Moreover, his statement was that companies “like Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T” are part of the \nd S rn  17 program, indicating that the list was hypothetical or, at least, non-exclusive.  The ambiguity of the \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 statement is not a sufficient basis to require that the DOJ specifically identify all telecommunications \nN\n19 service providers associated with the program.  “[E]ven if a fact has been the subject of media \n20 speculation, its official acknowledgment could damage national security.”  Public Citizen, 11 F.3d at \n21 201 (citing Afshar, 702 F.2d at 1130). \n22 Next, EFF argues that the statements of Raj De, General Counsel of the NSA, confirmed that \n23 “three different providers” participated in the call record collection program.  The Court does not \n24 agree.  De’s statement was a response to a question presented to him on a discussion panel about the \n25 need for a program that aggregated data from telecommunications providers in advance, rather than \n26 the government seeking information from individual providers on a “one-off basis.”  (Second \n27 Rumold Declaration, Exh. C [Counterterrorism, National Security, and the Rule of Law, Aspen \n28 Security Forum Panel (July 18, 2013)] at 12.)  De’s reference to “three different providers” cannot be \n9 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page10 of 13\n \n1 analyzed in a vacuum.  The remark was preceded by his statement that he was “using a hypothetical \n2 example” to illustrate his answer.  (Id. at 13.)  De went on to say that, if an investigation were done \n3 in the traditional way, under the hypothetical presented (tracking down the phone contacts made by a \n4 particular phone number tied to a terrorist organization), the investigation would require searches by \n5 “multiple providers” followed by analytics to aggregate the data from “three different providers.”  \n6 (Id.)  De did not release or acknowledge officially any classified information in the context of \n7 discussing this hypothetical example.  Further, even if the statement could be considered an \n8 acknowledgement that “three different providers” participated in the program, that information is not \n9 identical to what EFF seeks here: the specific identities of all telecommunications service providers \n10 that participated in the program.  The public availability of “similar” or “overlapping” information \n11 does not suffice to negate the government’s classification; “instead, the specific information sought \n12 by the plaintiff must already be in the public domain by official disclosure.” Wolf v. C.I.A., 473 F.3d \na \nrt  ni 13 370, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (citing Public Citizen, 11 F.3d at 201, 203; Military Audit Project v. \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 752-53 (D.C.Cir. 1981)); accord Hudson River, 891 F.2d at 421. \nc C\nDistri t of  15 The inherent risks to national security and government investigations of identifying the \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 specific telecommunications carriers is not mitigated by the government’s declassification of general \nd S rn  17 information about the call record collection program.  As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, official \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 confirmation of the existence of or general information about an intelligence program does not \nN\n19 eliminate the dangers to national security of compelling disclosure of the program’s details.  \n20 Mohamed v. Jeppesen, 614 F.3d 1070, 1086, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010) (official acknowledgment of \n21 existence of CIA extraordinary rendition program did not preclude details of program remaining \n22 state secrets if details’ disclosure would risk harm to national security); Al-Haramain Islamic \n23 Found., Inc. v. Bush, 507 F.3d 1190, 1203 (9th Cir. 2007) (concluding that even though the \n24 government had publicly acknowledged the existence of terrorist surveillance program, disclosing \n25 whether the plaintiff had been surveilled would compromise national security). \n26 C.   Withholding Formal OLC Advice Memorandum \n27 Finally, EFF challenges the withholding of the Census Memorandum, a legal advice \n28 memorandum from OLC to the Department of Commerce.  DOJ has withheld the OLC \n10 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page11 of 13\n \n1 memorandum pursuant to Exemption 5, asserting that it was prepared by OLC for the purpose of \n2 providing confidential legal advice to the Department of Commerce regarding the interaction \n3 between disclosure provisions in the Patriot Act, as amended, and prohibitions on disclosure in the \n4 Census Act, 13 U.S.C. §§ 8, 9, 214, and therefore subject to the deliberative process privilege.  DOJ \n5 submits evidence that the Census Memorandum was prepared to aid the Department of Commerce in \n6 determining its legal obligations with respect to disclosure of census information to federal law \n7 enforcement of national security officers.   \n8 EFF argues that, even if the deliberative process privilege might have shielded the Census \n9 Memorandum from disclosure when it was initially created, it can no longer be withheld because it \n10 has become a controlling statement of the executive branch’s legal position and, specifically, has \n11 been adopted as the opinion of the executive branch in proceedings before the FISC.  Sears, 421 U.S. \n12 at 152161.  The Court agrees.  \na \nrt  ni 13 “[T]he public is vitally concerned with the reasons…for an agency policy actually adopted.”  \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 Sears, 421 U.S. at 152.  “These reasons, if expressed within the agency, constitute the ‘working law’ \nc C\nDistri t of  15 of the agency” and cannot be withheld from disclosure under Exemption 5.  Sears, 421 U.S. at 152-\nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 53.  Thus, an agency is “required to disclose ‘orders and interpretations which it actually applies to \nd S rn  17 cases before it,’ in order to prevent the development of ‘secret law.’”  Coastal States Gas Corp. v. \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 Dep't of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 867-68 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (citing Sterling Drug, Inc. v. FTC, 146 U.S. \nN\n19 App. D.C. 237, 247 (1971)); see also Brennan Ctr. for Justice at New York Univ. Sch. of Law v. U.S. \n20 Dep't of Justice, 697 F.3d 184, 208 (2d Cir. 2012) (finding documents otherwise subject to \n21 deliberative process and attorney-client privileges required to be disclosed because OLC’s draft legal \n22 opinion was incorporated into client-agency’s guidance documents).   \n23 The Second Circuit’s recent decision in New York Times Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 13-422 \n24 L, __F.3d__, 2014 WL 2838861 (2d Cir. June 23, 2014) is instructive.  In the New York Times case, \n25 the court held that an OLC advice memorandum provided to the Department of Defense (“DOD”) \n26 lost its privileged character because numerous DOD and DOJ officials referred to the legal analysis \n27 in public statements, and an officially released DOJ White Paper incorporated the details of the \n28 OLC’s analysis in a manner that “virtually paralleled” the OLC advice memorandum.  Id. at *12, 13-\n11 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page12 of 13\n \n1 16; see also Nat'l Council of La Raza v. Dep't of Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 357 (2d Cir. 2005) (“repeated \n2 references” to OLC memorandum by the Attorney General and high-ranking DOJ officials \n3 “demonstrate[d] that the Department regarded the [m]emorandum as the exclusive statement of, and \n4 justification for, its new policy....”).  Thus, DOJ could no longer withhold the OLC advice \n5 memorandum under FOIA Exemption 5.  \n6 Here, the Court’s review of the evidence, both in the public record and in camera, establishes \n7 that the Census Memorandum was cited as legal authority and adopted as the working law of DOJ.  \n8 The declaration of Paul P. Colborn, Special Counsel in the OLC, stated that the OLC memorandum \n9 was “provided to the [FISC] in connection with an application submitted by the Department [of \n10 Justice] in a matter that was concluded.”  (Colborn Decl., ¶ 17.)2  The Court’s in camera review \n11 confirms that DOJ cited the Census Memorandum in an application to the FISC, referencing it as \n12 DOJ’s legal position on the census-related issues therein, and contrasting it with other legal issues \na \nrt  ni 13 argued in the application.  DOJ offered the Census Memorandum as a statement of the law to bolster \nu r\no o\nC if\nt  al 14 its legal arguments concerning matters unrelated to the subject of the Census Memorandum itself.  \nc C\nDistri t of  15 Thus, DOJ cited the Census Memorandum in the context of carrying out its duties, and in connection \nc\ns  ri\ntate Dist 16 with matters completely unrelated to the OLC’s provision of advice to the Department of Commerce.  \nd S rn  17 Moreover, DOJ has indicated that it will continue to rely on the Census Memorandum in other \ne e\nt h\nni rt\nU o 18 contexts as necessary. \nN\n19 DOJ argues that the D.C. Circuit recently determined that OLC memoranda are exempt from \n20 disclosure under Exemption 5 and do not qualify as final opinions or secret law, citing Elec. Frontier \n21 Found. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 739 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“[b]ecause OLC cannot speak \n22 authoritatively on the FBI's policy, the OLC Opinion differs from memoranda we have found to \n23 constitute the “working law” of an agency”).  Such a blanket argument ignores that the proper \n24 determination of whether a document can be withheld under “the deliberative process privilege \n25 is…dependent on the individual document and the role it plays in the administrative process.” \n26 Coastal States v. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 867 (D.C. Cir. 1980); see also Lardner v. Dep't of \n27\n                                                 \n28 2  In addition to its submission to the FISC, the Census Memorandum was shared, in \nconfidence, with the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  (Colborn Dec. at ¶17, Exh. D.) \n12 \n\nCase4:11-cv-05221-YGR   Document90   Filed08/11/14   Page13 of 13\n \n1 Justice, 638 F. Supp. 2d 14, 22 (D.D.C. 2009) (noting that “the fact that the FOIA requests in the two \n2 actions, as well as the materials responsive to those requests, differ considerably counsels against \n3 application of collateral estoppel”).  Regardless of whether OLC attorneys have policymaking \n4 authority within the Department of Commerce (the agency to whom the advice was given) or DOJ \n5 (the agency that used the advice), it was the DOJ that cited the document as a statement of applicable \n6 law and policy in an unrelated proceeding.  \n7 III.   CONCLUSION  \n8   Based upon the foregoing, the DOJ’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART \n9 AND DENIED IN PART and EFF’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED \n10 IN PART.   \n11 The parties are directed to submit a proposed form of judgment, approved as to form by both \n12 parties, forthwith.  \na \nrt  ni 13 This terminates Dkt.

(Dkt. No. \nUnit orth 17 60.)  The Court granted the stipulation in light of recent developments concerning release of \nN\npreviously classified information by the Director of National Intelligence (“DNI”) related to Section \n18\n215 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, 50 U.S.C. § 1861 (“Section 215”).

      "text": " \n \n1  \n \n2  \n \n3  \n \n4  \n \n5  \n \n6 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n7  \n \n8  \nELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION,  Case No.: 4:11-cv-05221-YGR \n9    \n \n  ORDER RE: PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS \n Pl aintiff, \n10  \nFOR IN CAMERA REVIEW  \n   \n11  vs.   \n \n   \n12  \nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,  \nstrict Court  of California  1134  Defendant.    \nDi ct  Presently before the Court are the renewed cross-motions for summary judgment on \ned States  ern Distri 1156 Plaintiff’s claim under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 522, that Defendant is \nUnit orth 17 withholding agency records without legitimate justification under any of the limited exemptions in \nN\nthe statute.  (Dkt. Nos. 77 and 79.)  The Court has thoroughly reviewed the parties’ submissions and \n18\nheard oral argument on the motions.  The Court has also reviewed in camera the ex parte, classified \n19\nversion of the declaration of Jennifer L. Hudson, submitted in support of Defendant’s summary \n20\njudgment motion.  Based upon this review, the Court ORDERS that Defendant produce pertinent \n21\ndocuments for in camera review.  \n22\nIn FOIA cases, a court reviews the government agency’s decision to withhold records de \n23\nnovo, and the government bears the burden of proving records have been properly withheld.  5 \n24\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).  “Unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported \n25\nby substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious, the FOIA expressly places the burden ‘on the \n26\nagency to sustain its action.’”  Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 \n27\nU.S. 749, 755 (1989) quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).  Thus, when claiming one of FOIA’s \n28\n \n\n \n1 exemptions, the agency bears the burden of demonstrating to a reviewing court that withheld \n2 information is “clearly exempt.”  Birch v. USPS, 803 F.2d 1206, 1209 (D.C. Cir. 1986). \n3 District courts have broad discretion to order in camera inspection of the actual documents \n4 the agency seeks to withhold.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).  Lion Raisins v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 354 \n5 F.3d 1072, 1079 (9th Cir. 2004); Quinon v. F.B.I., 86 F.3d 1222, 1228 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Such in \ncamera inspection is particularly necessary when the government agency has not sustained its burden \n6\nbased on its testimony or declarations alone.  Lion Raisins, 354 F.3d at 1079.  In camera review is \n7\nalso appropriate where there is evidence to suggest that the agency has not acted in good faith, either \n8\nwithin the FOIA action itself or in the underlying activities that generated the records sought.  \n9\nQuinon, 86 F.3d at 1228; Rugiero v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 257 F.3d 534, 543 (6th Cir. 2001), cert. \n10\ndenied, 534 U.S. 1334 (2002); Allen v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 636 F.2d 1287, 1298 (D.C. Cir. \n11\n1980) overruled on other grounds in Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C., Inc. v. \n12\nSmith, 721 F.2d 828 (D.C. Cir. 1983).   Further, in determining whether to undertake an in camera \nrt  nia  13\nou or review, a court must take into account concerns of judicial economy and the strength of the public’s \nct C Calif 14\nstri of  15 interest in disclosure of the documents sought.  Rugiero, 257 F.3d at 543; Allen, 636 F.2d at 1298.  \nDi ct \nUnited States  orthern Distri 1167 The eviHdeenrcee,  tihne t Cheo urerct ofirndd ssh tohwats  atnh aitn  scoammee drao cinusmpeencttsio, np roefv tihoeu ssluyb wjeictht hdeolcdu imn etnhtes  ciso uwrsaerr oanf ttehdis.   \nN litigation and now declassified, had been withheld in their entirety when a disclosure of reasonably \n18\nsegregable portions of those documents would have been required.  Further, the withholding \n19\nfollowed an Order from this Court expressing concern that the agency had failed to explain \n20\nsufficiently why the withheld documents “would be so replete with descriptions of intelligence \n21\nactivities, sources and methods that no portions thereof would contain” reasonably segregable and \n22\nproducible, non-exempt information.  (Order Re: Further Submission on Cross-Motion for Summary \n23\nJudgment, Dkt. No. 49, at 2-3.)   \n24\nFurther, the Court finds that the public’s interest in the documents withheld is significant.  \n25\nThe scope and legality of the government’s current surveillance practices of broad swaths of its \n26\ncitizenry is a topic of intense public interest and concern.  “The Freedom of Information Act was \n27\naimed at ending secret law and insuring that this country have ‘an informed, intelligent electorate.”” \n28\nAllen v. Cent. Intelligence Agency, 636 F.2d 1287, 1299 (D.C. Cir. 1980), citing H.R.Rep.No.1497, \n2 \n\n \n1 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1966) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1966, p. 2419.  In light of this \n2 public interest, in camera review to assure that the agency is complying with its obligations to \n3 disclose non-exempt material is certainly merited.  Finally, as the parties have narrowed the range of \n4 documents for review, the burden on judicial resources is not significant.   \n5 Based upon the foregoing, Defendant is ORDERED to deliver to the Court the following \ndocuments for in camera inspection to assist the Court in making a responsible de novo \n6\ndetermination whether the documents are clearly exempt from disclosure under the FOIA:  \n7\n(1) FISC opinion dated 8/20/2008 (6 pages);  \n8\n(2) FISC order dated 10/31/2006 (19 pages); \n9\n(3) FISC orders dated 2/17/2006 (17 pages); \n10\n(4) FISC orders dated 2/24/2006 (8 pages); \n11\n(5) FISC orders dated 12/16/2005 (16 pages). \n12\n(See Dkt.
