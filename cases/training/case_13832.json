    "summary": "<p>On December 8, 1965, the plaintiffs filed this school desegregation suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The plaintiffs, a group of African-American schoolchildren, brought suit against the defendant Franklin County Board of Education to enjoin the operation of a segregated school system. They were represented by, among others, Jack Greenberg and Derrick A. Bell (for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund). The United States intervened as a plaintiff on January 20, 1966. </p><p>Prior to the 1965-66 school year, the Franklin County school system was wholly segregated. Attempts in 1963 and 1964 to desegregate resulted in violence and threats. Beginning in the 1965-66 school year, the Board adopted a freedom of choice desegregation plan pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It became clear, however, that the Board had no interest in sincerely pursuing desegregation through this—or any—means, and the freedom-of-choice plan did little to alter the status quo. </p><p>After the lawsuit was filed, the district court (Judge Algernon Butler) heard the plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary and permanent injunction and began discussions with the Board on workable desegregation plans. The Board's use of freedom of choice plans continued through 1967 in the face of \"marked hostility to school desegregation . . . and wide publicity [as well as] acts of intimidation, threats and reprisals against Negro parents who . . . requested reassignment of their children to previously all-white schools.\" <i>Coppedge v. Franklin County Board of Education</i>, 273 F.Supp. 289, 295 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 21, 1967).</p><p>Finally, on August 21, 1967, after little progress, Judge Butler ordered the Board to submit a more comprehensive and specific plan for desegregation, not based on freedom of choice, for the 1968-69 school year. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court; in doing so, it noted the extent of the threats, intimidation and violence that had, up to then, marked the district's desegregation efforts. It admonished the Board for its woefully inadequate attempts at desegregation, concluding that the Board had done virtually \"nothing.\" Coppedge v. Franklin County Board of Education, 394 F.2d 410, 412 (4th Cir. Apr. 8, 1968).</p><p>In the summer of 1968, the district court ordered the Board to submit new desegregation plans for the 1968-69 school year. The Board, of course, applied for a stay pending appeal of those orders, claiming administrative difficulties. The district court rebuffed that argument. Surveying the situation, it concluded <blockquote>The defendants' conduct in this case, including the submission of desegregation plans manifestly incompatible with the letter and spirit of the orders requiring their submission, is a reflection of the marked community hostility to desegregation which brought about the initial rejection by this Court and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit of defendants' freedom of choice plan. It is now well settled, however, that community hostility to desegregation, even in the form of the probability or threat of white pupils fleeing from districts in which Negroes significantly outnumber them, does not provide a legal defense against desegregation.</blockquote> Coppedge v. Franklin County Board of Education, 293 F.Supp. 356, 363 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 22, 1968). The Fourth Circuit affirmed the decision. 404 F.2d 1177.</p><p>Through the 1970s and into the 1990s, the case remained fairly stagnant, with the Board submitting its annual reports. The district court issued two more orders in that period, in 1970 and 1978, modifying the desegregation plans. In 1996, however, the district court (at this point Judge James Fox) determined that the Board was not in compliance with several aspects of the previous orders. As a result, it entered a new order. </p><p>By 2002, the Board claimed that it had made sufficient progress towards desegregation, so it moved for a dismissal of the case and a declaration of unitary status. Judge Fox granted that motion in part (declaring unitary status in areas such as school transportation, facilities and faculty desegregation) but denying it in others (notably, student assignment). In 2003 and 2005, the district court entered two more orders, updating the Board's plans relating to the areas of the case that remained open. </p><p>On September 29, 2017, the case was reassigned to Judge Louise Wood Flanagan. The parties filed an initial joint motion for unitary status on January 12, 2018, which was not approved. Their follow-up motion for partial unitary status on December 14, 2018, on the other hand, was approved on December 18. The district was declared unitary in the following areas: desegregation of staff, academic achievement, advanced course offerings and enrollment, special education programs, and student dropouts. The court retained jurisdiction over the remaining compliance areas, including discipline. </p><p>As of April 2020, the case remains on-going.</p><p><u>Available Opinions</u></p><p><i>Coppedge v.

Kennedy, Attorney,\nDepartment of Justice, on brief) for Plaintiff-Intervenor,\nand Linwood T. Peoples for Amici Curiae.\n\nHAYNSWORTH, Chief Judge:\nThe School Board of a county in which there has\nbeen much Ku Klux Klan activity appeals from an order\nrequiring it to abandon its freedom of choice plan and to\nadopt a new plan for pupil assignments based upon a unitary\nsystem of geographic attendance zones or upon the consolida-\ntion of grades or schools or both. Since it clearly appears\nthat the School Board did nothing to relieve the pressures\ninhibiting the free exercise of the right of choice, the\nDistrict Judge properly required the Board to turn to\nother measures.\nThe School Board of Franklin County, North\nCarolina took no steps to desegregate its schools until\n1965 when it acted under a court order. It then adopted a\nfreedom of choice plan. There followed, however, numerous\nacts of violence and threats directed against Negro members\nof the community, particularly those requesting transfers\nof. their children into formerly all-white schools. Shots\nwere fired into houses, oil was poured into wells and some\nof the Negro leaders were subjected to a barrage of threaten-\ning telephone calls. The violence was widely reported in\nthe local press, and an implicit threat was carried home to\neveryone by publication of the names of Negro applicants\nfor transfer.\nThe School Board did nothing to counter or allevi-\nate these conditions. It took the position that it was not\n\nresponsible for the threats and acts of violence, but\nit did not recognize its responsibility to assure true\nfreedom in the exercise of the right of choice or to\nadopt some other plan for the assignment of pupils\nwhich would relieve them from extraneous pressures.\nWhen ordered by the District Court in 1966 to encourage\nfaculty transfers to desegregate faculties, it contented\nitself with the circulation of a staff memorandum,\nquoting that portion of the Court's order. Thereafter\nit did assign two Negro librarians' to two white schools\nand a white librarian and a part-time English teacher\nto one all-Negro school, but that was insubstantial\nprogress in those three schools and the faculties of\nthe remaining nine schools continued to be entirely\nsegregated. In the most charitable view, the School\nBoard's response to the Court's order to encourage\nfaculty transfers across racial lines was wooden and\nlittle calculated to procure the result the Court\nenvisioned.\nThe School Board took no other ste ps to\nalleviate the threatening conditions. It offered no\nspecial protection. It gave no assurances. It did\nnothing.\nUnder the circumstances, it is not surprising\nthat few Negro pupils availed themselves of the right\nof transfer into a formerly all-white school and that\n98.5% of the Negro pupils in the district remained in\nall-Negro schools.\n- 3 -\n\nFaced with these circumstances in the summer of\n1967, the Court ordered the School Board to transfer to\nformerly all-white schools a sufficient number of Negro\npupils to bring the Negro enrollment in formerly all-white\n1\nschools up to 10% of the total Negro pupil population.\nFor the 1968-69 school year, the Court ordered the School\nBoard to adopt and submit a plan of involuntary assignments\nbased upon geographic attendance zones or upon the consolida-\ntion of grades or schools or both. The latter suggestion\nwas born of the apparent fact that throughout the school\ndistrict white and Negro schools'are paired in relatively\nclose proximity to each other.\nIt is that order in its application to the school\nyear 1968-1969 that the School Board contests, contending\nthat it was entitled to maintain its freedom of choice plan,\nnotwithstanding its inaction in its support.\nFifty-five of the Negro pupils involuntarily trans-\nferred for the 1967-1968 school years to formerly all-white\nschools obtained a lawyer and sought intervention in this\nCourt in support of a freedom of choice plan. They want\nthe right to remain in the familiar surroundings of all-\n2\nNegro schools.\n1. We do not pause to consider the propriety of that interim\nmeasure under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, particularly\n42 U.S.C.A. §§ 2000c(b) and 2000c-6(a). A substantial part\nof the school year is now over and no one, not even the\nprotesting Negro transferees, request reassignment at this\ntime of the year.\n2. The petition to intervene was not allowed, but they were\nheard as amicus curiae in support of reversal. Our refusal\n• to allow formal intervention in this Court is, of course,\nwithout prejudice to any application they may subsequently\nfile for intervention in the District Court.\n- 4 -\n\nIn Bowman v. County School Board of Charles City\n4 \nCounty,  Cir., 382 F.2d 326, we took pains to point out\nthat freedom of choice is an acceptable plan for the desegre-\ngation of a public school system only if the choice is free\nin the practical context of its exercise. The record here\nabundantly supports the district court's finding that the\nchoice has not been free in the practical context of its\nexercise in Franklin County, North Carolina. The deliberate\nacts of violence and despoiliation and the repeated threats\nand harrassments were clearly calculated to have an inhibiting\neffect upon the entire Negro population, an effect that was\nclearly enhanced by the wide publicity given to it and made\nextremely pointed by the publication of the names of transfer\napplicants and their parents. Since the School Board  had\ndone nothing to remedy the situation, to insure freedom in\nthe exercise of the right of choice or to modify its assign-\nment plan, the District Court was plainly right in requiring\nthe School Board to turn to something else. Indeed, it\nwould have been very derelict in its duty had it permitted\nthe School Board to proceed on in its indifferent way after\nits less than half-hearted compliance with its faculty desegre-\ngation order and the abundant evidence that the intimidating\nactivity had indeed had a chilling effect on the Negro resi-\ndents of the district.\n5\n\nAs to the applicants for intervention, if a real\nand practical freedom of choice cannot be extended to those\nNegroes who wish to go to formerly all-white schools, it\ncannot be extended to those who have different preferences.\nOn the record made before it in the summer of 1967,\nthe Court quite naturally and properly concluded that the\nsituation called for drastic measures and that no pupil\nchoice should have any place in it.\nWe conclude that the Court's order was well within\nthe range of the discretion vested in it.\nAffirmed.\n6\n\n8 -1968\nAPR \n'SAMUEL W. PHILLIPS\nCLERK\nAlbert V. Bryan, Circuit Judge, concurring specially:\nWhile I am concurring in the majority opinion,\nI do not want my assent to be construed as approving these\nportions of the District Court's decree:\n(1) The transfer of pupils with an eye to• a\nracial balancing of students in any school. In my read-\ning the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 USC 2000c and 2000c-6(a),\nforbids \"any order [of a Federal court] seeking to achieve\na racial balance in any school by requiring the transporta\ntion of pupils or students from one school to another\".\n(2) The restriction upon the newspaper publica-\ntion of the names of the transferring pupils, for it\nviolates the First Amendment. This is official public\ninformation, and no matter the motive of the publisher,\nit cannot be suppressed.\nThe task of the District Judge was not enviable,\nand. he acted conscientiously to meet the outrageous and\ncowardly acts of the criminal element. As the present\nschool session expires in a few weeks, and the points I\nnow make may thereafter become moot, I join in the Court's\nopinion.\n\nForm DJ-96a DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n(Rev. 6-22-66)\nROUTING SLIP\nTO : NAME DIVISION BUILDING ROOM\nFts_s\n2.\n3.\n4.\n]SIGNATURE(cid:9) COMMENT(cid:9) PER CONVERSATION\nn  no \nAPPROVAL(cid:9) NECESSARY ACTION(cid:9) AS REQUESTED\nn \nII SEE ME(cid:9) NOTE AND RETURN(cid:9) nNOTE AND FILE\nIIIh 1 RECOMMENDATION(cid:9) CALL HE YOUR INFORMATION\n(cid:9) ANSWER OR ACKNOWL-\nI(cid:9) 1 EDGE ON OR BEFORE\nIIII\nr-/ PREPARE REPLY FOR\nTHE SIGNATURE OF\nREMARKS\nCQ4-4-s2._ 0:,‘,44)41,1\nFROM: NAME BUILDING & ROOM EXT.

It took the position that it was not\n\nresponsible for the threats and acts of violence, but\nit did not recognize its responsibility to assure true\nfreedom in the exercise of the right of choice or to\nadopt some other plan for the assignment of pupils\nwhich would relieve them from extraneous pressures.\nWhen ordered by the District Court in 1966 to encourage\nfaculty transfers to desegregate faculties, it contented\nitself with the circulation of a staff memorandum,\nquoting that portion of the Court's order. Thereafter\nit did assign two Negro librarians' to two white schools\nand a white librarian and a part-time English teacher\nto one all-Negro school, but that was insubstantial\nprogress in those three schools and the faculties of\nthe remaining nine schools continued to be entirely\nsegregated. In the most charitable view, the School\nBoard's response to the Court's order to encourage\nfaculty transfers across racial lines was wooden and\nlittle calculated to procure the result the Court\nenvisioned.\nThe School Board took no other ste ps to\nalleviate the threatening conditions. It offered no\nspecial protection. It gave no assurances. It did\nnothing.\nUnder the circumstances, it is not surprising\nthat few Negro pupils availed themselves of the right\nof transfer into a formerly all-white school and that\n98.5% of the Negro pupils in the district remained in\nall-Negro schools.\n- 3 -\n\nFaced with these circumstances in the summer of\n1967, the Court ordered the School Board to transfer to\nformerly all-white schools a sufficient number of Negro\npupils to bring the Negro enrollment in formerly all-white\n1\nschools up to 10% of the total Negro pupil population.\nFor the 1968-69 school year, the Court ordered the School\nBoard to adopt and submit a plan of involuntary assignments\nbased upon geographic attendance zones or upon the consolida-\ntion of grades or schools or both. The latter suggestion\nwas born of the apparent fact that throughout the school\ndistrict white and Negro schools'are paired in relatively\nclose proximity to each other.\nIt is that order in its application to the school\nyear 1968-1969 that the School Board contests, contending\nthat it was entitled to maintain its freedom of choice plan,\nnotwithstanding its inaction in its support.\nFifty-five of the Negro pupils involuntarily trans-\nferred for the 1967-1968 school years to formerly all-white\nschools obtained a lawyer and sought intervention in this\nCourt in support of a freedom of choice plan.

The record here\nabundantly supports the district court's finding that the\nchoice has not been free in the practical context of its\nexercise in Franklin County, North Carolina. The deliberate\nacts of violence and despoiliation and the repeated threats\nand harrassments were clearly calculated to have an inhibiting\neffect upon the entire Negro population, an effect that was\nclearly enhanced by the wide publicity given to it and made\nextremely pointed by the publication of the names of transfer\napplicants and their parents. Since the School Board  had\ndone nothing to remedy the situation, to insure freedom in\nthe exercise of the right of choice or to modify its assign-\nment plan, the District Court was plainly right in requiring\nthe School Board to turn to something else. Indeed, it\nwould have been very derelict in its duty had it permitted\nthe School Board to proceed on in its indifferent way after\nits less than half-hearted compliance with its faculty desegre-\ngation order and the abundant evidence that the intimidating\nactivity had indeed had a chilling effect on the Negro resi-\ndents of the district.\n5\n\nAs to the applicants for intervention, if a real\nand practical freedom of choice cannot be extended to those\nNegroes who wish to go to formerly all-white schools, it\ncannot be extended to those who have different preferences.\nOn the record made before it in the summer of 1967,\nthe Court quite naturally and properly concluded that the\nsituation called for drastic measures and that no pupil\nchoice should have any place in it.\nWe conclude that the Court's order was well within\nthe range of the discretion vested in it.\nAffirmed.\n6\n\n8 -1968\nAPR \n'SAMUEL W.

Since it clearly appears\nthat the School Board did nothing to relieve the pressures\ninhibiting the free exercise of the right of choice, the\nDistrict Judge properly required the Board to turn to\nother measures.\nThe School Board of Franklin County, North\nCarolina took no steps to desegregate its schools until\n1965 when it acted under a court order. It then adopted a\nfreedom of choice plan. There followed, however, numerous\nacts of violence and threats directed against Negro members\nof the community, particularly those requesting transfers\nof. their children into formerly all-white schools. Shots\nwere fired into houses, oil was poured into wells and some\nof the Negro leaders were subjected to a barrage of threaten-\ning telephone calls. The violence was widely reported in\nthe local press, and an implicit threat was carried home to\neveryone by publication of the names of Negro applicants\nfor transfer.\nThe School Board did nothing to counter or allevi-\nate these conditions.

This matter is before the court upon motion by Plaintiffs \nfor attorney’s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). \nDefendant  Franklin  County  Board  of  Education  (the \n“Board”) has responded, and the matter is now ripe for \nSynopsis  disposition. \nBackground: In ongoing school desegregation litigation,    \nplaintiffs moved for award of attorney fees and costs   \nunder civil rights statute for prevailing on school’s motion \nto dismiss. \n   I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY \nThis longstanding desegregation action was initiated by \nHoldings:  The  District  Court,  James  C.  Fox,  Senior  Plaintiffs on December 8, 1965. Beginning in August \nDistrict Judge, held that:  1967, the court issued a series of orders requiring the \n   Board to submit annual reports and data regarding, among \n[1] school’s precarious financial system was not special  other  things,  teacher  hiring,  nonrenewal \ncircumstance warranting denial of award;  recommendations, course offerings, faculty assignment, \n   and student assignment.

As a result of the \nlimits of plaintiffs’ success; and  District’s alleged noncompliance, a consent order was \n   entered by the undersigned on June 14, 1996. The consent \n[4] fees at hourly rates ranging from $325 to $185 would  order  adopted  a  remedial  plan  designed  to  further \nbe awarded.  desegregation. \n     \nOn January 11, 2000, a status conference was held to \nMotion granted.  determine whether the Board had complied with the 1996 \n   consent order. At the conclusion of the status conference, \n*570 the undersigned directed the Board to file a motion \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nto dismiss, seeking a declaration of unitary status. \n  \n*569  Conrad  O.

Financial Conditions \norder,  the  court  found  that  the  District  had  achieved  [3] Although sympathetic to the school system’s precarious \nunitary  status  in  the  following  areas:  (1)  school  financial condition, the court will not deny the award of \ntransportation;  (2)  extracurricular  activities;  (3)  school  attorney’s  fees  on  that  basis.  Most  courts  that  have \nconstruction and facilities; (4) student transfers; and (5)  considered the issue have determined that the ability, or \nfaculty desegregation. However, the court found that the  inability,  to  pay  attorney’s  fees  is  not  a  “special \nDistrict had not achieved unitary status in terms of (1)  circumstance”  warranting  the  denial  of  an  award.  See \nquality of education, (2) desegregation of staff, or (3)  Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce, 716 F.2d 177, \nschool assignments. Accordingly, the Board’s motion to  180 (3d Cir.1983) (“[T]he losing party’s financial ability \ndismiss  was  allowed  in  part  and  denied  in  part.  to  pay  is  not  a  ‘special  circumstance.’  ”);  Entm’t \nAdditionally, the court directed the Board to develop a  Concepts, Inc., III v.

The desegregation orders and applicable federal law require the District to, inter\nalia, eliminate the vestiges of discrimination, to the extent practicable, in its student assignments,\nfaculty and staff hiring and assignments, quality of education, school transportation,\nextracurricular activities, school construction and facilities, and student transfers.  The\ndesegregation orders also require the District to report periodically to the Court, plaintiffs, and\nPage 1 of 21\n\nplaintiff-intervenor on several facets of the District’s school operations.\nOn April 12, 2000, the District filed a Motion to Dismiss asking, inter alia, the Court to\ndeclare that the District has achieved unitary status and dismiss this case and the applicable\ndesegregation orders.  Plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor opposed the District’s motion for unitary\nstatus on grounds that the District has not eliminated the vestiges of discrimination in certain\nareas to the extent practicable.\nOn June 24, 2002, this Court granted in part, and denied in part, the District’s request for\na finding of unitary status.  The Court held that “the District has achieved unitary status in the\nfollowing areas: (1) school transportation; (2) extracurricular activities; (3) school construction\nand facilities; (4) student transfers; and (5) faculty desegregation.”  June 2002 Order at 2.  The\nCourt, however, denied the District’s request for unitary status in the areas of student\nassignments, staff desegregation and quality of education.  See id. at 2-3.  The Court concluded\nits order by directing the District to develop a proposal to address the three remaining areas of\nnoncompliance, and by establishing a timetable for plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor to respond\nto the District’s proposal and for the parties to explore the possibility of developing a proposed\nconsent decree.  See id. at 3.  As directed by the Court, the parties have engaged in good faith\nnegotiations since the June 2002 Order.  In an effort to address the Court’s concerns regarding\nstudent assignments, quality of education and staff desegregation, and eliminate the possibility of\nprotracted and costly litigation, the parties have agreed to the desegregation initiatives detailed\nbelow.  \nIt is the determination of this Court that the actions embodied in this Consent Order:\n1) comport with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America\nPage 2 of 21\n\nand applicable federal law; 2) are reasonable, equitable and appropriate to ensure that the\npractices and policies of the District comply with applicable federal law and the desegregation\norders issued in this case; and 3) will, if properly implemented, further the orderly desegregation\nof the schools operated by the District.\nTHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the\nfollowing plan be entered, announced, and implemented as appropriate steps for attaining\ncompliance with applicable federal law:\nI.  STUDENT ASSIGNMENTS\nThe District will take the following steps to ensure that it has eliminated the vestiges of\ndiscrimination, to the extent practicable, in student assignments:\nA.  The District will continue following its majority to minority transfer program, under\nwhich any student may “transfer between district schools if . . . : (A) the percentage of students of\na given race at the school from which the student desires to transfer is greater than the average\ndistrict-wide percentage of such students for schools with the same grade structure; (B) the\nstudent who wishes to transfer is of that same race; and (C) the percentage of students of that\nsame race at the school to which the student desires to transfer is less than the average district-\nwide percentage of such students for schools with the same grade structure.”  June 1996 Order at\n3-4.  The District will provide transportation to all students who elect to participate in the\nmajority to minority transfer program and will be transferring between Franklinton Elementary\nand Youngsville Elementary, or between Louisburg Elementary and Royal Elementary;\nB.  Immediately after the entry of this Consent Order, the District will begin developing a\nlist of individuals qualified to serve as the District’s consultant who will study and determine, at\nPage 3 of 21\n\na reasonable and affordable cost, what practicable measures the District can take to further\ndesegregation in student assignments to each of the District’s schools.  In creating its list, the\nDistrict will consider any recommendations or input from the parties about potential candidates. \nThe District will provide its list of candidates to the parties, and permit the parties to participate\nin any interviews that the District conducts to review the qualifications of the candidates.  The\nDistrict will interview at least two of the candidates recommended by the other parties;\nC.  Within 90 days after the entry of this consent order, the District will advise the parties\nof the name and qualifications of a consultant that the District proposes to hire to study and\ndetermine what practicable measures the District can take to further desegregation in student\nassignments to each of the District’s schools.  After receiving the name and qualifications of the\nconsultant identified by the District, plaintiffs or plaintiff-intervenor may object to the District’s\nconsultant selection within 30 days.  If plaintiffs and/or plaintiff-intervenor object to the\nDistrict’s consultant selection, the parties will commence negotiations for a period of 30 days in\nan effort to reach agreement on the consultant to be selected.  If the parties are able to agree on\nthe consultant to be selected, the District will hire the consultant.  If the parties are not able to\nagree on the consultant to be selected, any party may submit the issue to the Court for resolution\nwithin 15 days of the end of the negotiation period.\nD.   The District, after hiring the consultant (see Section I(C), above), will provide the\nconsultant with all appropriate information necessary for the consultant to analyze the District\nand identify any practicable measures the District can take to further desegregation in student\nassignments to each of the District’s schools.  In completing the study, the consultant will\nconsider, inter alia, the following issues: existing attendance zone lines and practicable\nPage 4 of 21\n\nmodifications thereto; other practicable measures for furthering desegregation in student\nassignments to the District’s schools; projected growth in the District; estimated costs of any\nrecommendations, proposals or alternative plans; student transportation costs; existing school\nfacilities; proposed school construction; and student enrollment trends in charter schools, private\nschools and parochial schools located in the District.  The consultant will complete the study,\nprepare a written report outlining his or her findings, including a description of any practicable\nmeasures that the consultant determines the District may take to further desegregation in student\nassignments to the District’s schools, and provide a copy of the report (and any supporting\nanalysis) to all parties within 180 days of the date on which the consultant is hired.\nE.  Within 60 days of receiving the consultant’s report, the District will develop a\nproposed student assignment plan and provide a copy of that plan to plaintiffs and plaintiff-\nintervenor.  The District will also provide any reports, data, draft plans, or other information\nrelated to its proposed student assignment plan.  If the District, in its proposed student\nassignment plan, declines to implement any practicable measure(s) that the consultant’s report\nindicates the District could take to further desegregation in student assignments, the District will\nprovide, along with its proposed student assignment plan, the District’s written rationale for not\nimplementing the measure(s).\nF.  Plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor may provide the District with any written responses\nto the District’s proposed student assignment plan within 30 days of receiving the District’s plan\nand supporting documents.  After the end of the 30-day response period, the parties will begin a\n60-day negotiation period to discuss the District’s proposal and attempt to resolve any\ndisagreements.  If the parties are able to agree on a new student assignment plan, the District will\nPage 5 of 21\n\nsubmit the plan to the Court for approval, and upon such approval, begin implementing the plan\nby the 2005-06 school year.  If the parties are unable to agree on a new student assignment plan,\nany party may identify any unresolved issues and, within 15 days after the conclusion of the\nnegotiation period, ask the Court to schedule a hearing to resolve the matter.  \nII.  DESEGREGATION OF STAFF1 \nThe District will take the following steps to ensure that it has eliminated the vestiges of\ndiscrimination relating to its staff to the extent practicable:\nA.  The District will ensure that, by the 2003-04 school year, the percentages at each\nschool of black certificated and non-certificated staff will be no more than 10% below and no\nmore than 10% above the district-wide averages within each school level (e.g., the staff at each\nhigh school in the District will be compared against the combined staff of all high schools in the\nDistrict).  To facilitate meeting this standard, the District may use voluntary or involuntary staff\ntransfers; and\nB.  The District will continue its efforts to recruit black administrators, counselors,\npsychologists and media staff.  As part of its recruiting efforts, the District will, inter alia:\ncontact officials at nearby colleges and universities (including institutions that historically have,\nand have not, enrolled high numbers of black students) to identify black students who may be\ninterested in applying for employment with the District; contact local professional associations,\n1  For purposes of this decree, the term “staff” includes all certified and non-certified\n(classified) personnel except for teachers.  See June 2002 Order at 2 (adopting plaintiff-\nintervenor’s reasoning that the District has achieved unitary status in faculty desegregation, but\nnot in staff desegregation); Plaintiff-Intervenor’s Response to District’s Motion to Dismiss at 18-\n21 (in discussing staff desegregation, referencing data about certified staff such as administrators,\ncounselors, and media staff, and data about non-certified staff such as assistant teachers). \nPage 6 of 21\n\norganizations and civic groups with high black memberships (e.g., bar associations, teacher\nassociations, and churches) to advertise vacancies; and advertise vacancies in local newspapers\nthat have a  substantial number of black subscribers.\nC.  At the end of each school year, the District will identify any comparable school\ndistricts that have developed procedures or practices that have assisted the school in recruiting\nblack administrators, counselors, psychologists and media staff, and will ensure that all personnel\ninvolved in recruitment and/or hiring in the District receive information about those practices and\nprocedures.\nIII.  QUALITY OF EDUCATION\nThe District will take the steps described in this section (Section III) to ensure that it has\neliminated the vestiges of discrimination, to the extent practicable, in quality of education.  If,\nhowever, the District determines that it will not be able to implement one of the measures in this\nsection due to a lack of funding (and despite the District’s reasonable efforts to secure such\nfunding), the District will notify the parties and the parties will commence a 60-day period of\nnegotiations to determine if they can agree on an appropriate modification to this decree (e.g., a\nmodification that would permit the District to cease implementing the measure in question,\nreplace the measure with an appropriate alternative, etc.).  If the parties are not able to reach an\nagreement after the negotiations period, any party may, within 15 days after the conclusion of the\nnegotiation period, ask the Court to schedule a hearing to resolve the matter.\nA.  Academic Achievement\nThe District will take the following steps to ensure that it develops the academic potential\nand achievement of students of all races:\nPage 7 of 21\n\n1.  The District will continue implementing a one-on-one remedial reading\nprogram for all elementary school students, and will also provide one-on-one remedial reading\nassistance to at-risk middle and high school students with personalized education plans that\nrecommend such services;\n2.  The District will implement a plan in each school for improving the academic\nachievement of all students, and thereby for reducing the academic achievement gap between\nwhite students and black students;\n3.  The District will monitor academic achievement data once each school year. \nTo carry out its monitoring responsibilities, the District will collect and review data about the\nacademic achievement levels (as indicated by student performance on standardized tests and\nother assessments) of students of each race in each school.  If the District, through its review,\nidentifies data that indicate that black students in specific schools have low academic\nachievement rates when compared to students of other races, the District will investigate to\ndetermine the cause(s) of the low academic achievement rates among black students at each\nschool in question and, if appropriate, take steps to address the cause(s), such as by providing\ntutoring, remedial instruction, and other supplemental academic services; and\n4.  At the end of each school year, the District will identify any schools in the\ndistrict, or in other comparable school districts, that have developed procedures or practices that\nhave assisted the school in raising the academic performance levels of students of all races (and\nthereby reducing the academic achievement gap between white students and black students), and\nwill ensure that all schools in the District receive information about those practices and\nprocedures.\nPage 8 of 21\n\nB.  Advanced Course Offerings and Enrollment\nThe District will take the following steps to ensure that its advanced courses are offered\nand operated in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner:\n1.  The District will offer an equitable number of advanced placement, accelerated\nand honors classes (“advanced courses”) at each high school, and will allow students to enroll in\nthose classes without regard to race or other discriminatory factors;\n2.  The District will design and implement a plan for recruiting and encouraging\nblack students to register for advanced courses.  The District, as part of its plan, will:\na)  conduct outreach to the public, and particularly to students and parents,\nabout its advanced course offerings;\nb) develop and implement a system, for identifying students who may be\nable to succeed in advanced courses and for encouraging and preparing those students to register\nfor challenging courses that are consistent with their academic potential;\nc) implement initiatives to provide support to students (e.g., through\nmentoring, counseling on an individual or small-group basis, etc.) who enroll in, or express\ninterest in, advanced courses; and\nd) encourage teachers, through training, recognition, evaluation and other\ninitiatives, to identify, recruit and encourage black students to register for advanced courses;\n3.  The District will monitor student enrollment in advanced courses at the\nbeginning of each semester to ensure that those courses are being offered and operated in a fair\nand equitable manner.  To carry out its monitoring responsibilities, the District will collect and\nreview data from each school about the race and number of students who enroll in and complete\nPage 9 of 21\n\nadvanced courses.  If the District, through its review, identifies data that indicate that low\nnumbers of black students in specific schools (taking into account each school’s racial\ndemographics) are enrolling in and/or completing advanced courses, the District will investigate\nto determine the cause(s) of the low advanced course enrollment and/or completion rate among\nblack students at each school in question and, if appropriate, take steps to address the cause(s),\nsuch as by training faculty and staff about identifying and counseling students who may be\nsuccessful in advanced courses; and\n4.  At the end of each school year, the District will identify any schools in the\ndistrict, or in other comparable school districts, that have developed procedures or practices that\nhave assisted the school in encouraging a racially diverse group of students to enroll in and\ncomplete advanced courses, and will ensure that all middle and high schools in the District\nreceive information about those practices and procedures.\nC.  Discipline\nThe District will take the following steps to ensure that it administers discipline in a fair\nand nondiscriminatory manner:\n1.  The District will continue adhering to its uniform code of conduct; \n2.  The District will operate at least one program that will be available to serve as\nan alternative for students who are faced with suspension;\n3.  The District will monitor discipline data each semester during each school year\nto ensure that discipline is being administered fairly and without regard to race.  To carry out its\nmonitoring responsibilities, the District will collect and review data from each school about the\nrace and number of students receiving in-school suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, and\nPage 10 of 21\n\nother forms of discipline.  If the District, through its review, identifies data that indicate that high\nnumbers of black students in specific schools (taking into account each school’s racial\ndemographics) are being disciplined by in-school suspensions, out of school suspensions, or\nsome other form(s) of discipline, the District will investigate to determine the cause(s) of the\nhigh discipline rate among black students at each school in question and, if appropriate, take\nsteps to address the cause(s), including, but not limited to, training personnel on administering\ndiscipline in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner, reviewing and revising discipline procedures\nand practices, providing classroom management training, and creating corrective action plans for\nindividual faculty and staff; and\n4.  At the end of each school year, the District will identify any schools in the\ndistrict, or in other comparable school districts, that have developed procedures or practices that\nhave assisted the school in administering discipline in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner, and\nwill ensure that all schools in the District receive information about those practices and\nprocedures.\nD.  Gifted and Talented Program\nThe District will take the following steps to ensure that it administers its gifted and\ntalented program in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner:\n1.  The District will follow a gifted and talented program plan that is consistent\nwith any applicable State of North Carolina guidelines, and will ensure that its gifted and talented\nprogram plan will include provisions that will call for personnel to consider multiple factors\nwhen determining whether a student is eligible for the program;\n2.  The District will require that all teachers at the elementary and middle school\nPage 11 of 21\n\nlevels complete, on an annual basis, a training workshop about how to identify students from all\nstudent populations who may be able to qualify for the gifted/talented program; \n3.  The District will encourage teachers, through training, recognition, evaluation\nand other initiatives, to identify, and refer for assessment, students of all races who may be able\nto qualify for the gifted/talented program;\n4.  The District will conduct outreach to minority parents and students at each\nelementary and middle school about its gifted and talented program, including, but not limited to,\noutreach that will advise parents and students about the referral, identification and evaluation\nprocess for the program, and will provide information about the educational content of the\nprogram;\n5.  The District will monitor data about the gifted and talented program each\nsemester during each school year to ensure that the gifted and talented program is being\nadministered fairly and without regard to race.  To carry out its monitoring responsibilities, the\nDistrict will collect and review data from each school about the race and number of students who\nare referred for and/or qualify for the gifted and talented program.  If the District, through its\nreview, identifies data that indicate that low numbers of black students in specific schools (taking\ninto account each school’s racial demographics) are being referred for evaluation and/or are\nqualifying for the gifted and talented program, the District will investigate to determine the\ncause(s) of the low referral and/or qualification rates among black students at each school in\nquestion and, if appropriate, take steps to address the cause(s), such as providing staff\ndevelopment and ensuring that personnel are following referral and evaluation procedures; and\n6.  At the end of each school year, the District will identify any schools in the\nPage 12 of 21\n\ndistrict, or in other comparable school districts, that have developed procedures or practices that\nhave assisted the school in identifying a racially diverse group of students who are able to qualify\nfor the gifted and talented program, and will ensure that all elementary and middle schools in the\nDistrict receive information about those practices and procedures.\nE.  Special Education Program\nThe District will take the following steps to ensure that it administers its special\neducation program in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner:\n1.  The District will continue using Student Support Teams in each of its schools\nto, inter alia, assist in educating students by developing strategies to address behavioral,\nacademic, or other barriers that may hinder the student’s ability to learn;\n2.  The District will publicize, to the community at large, information about the\nspecial education program, including information about: the procedures that the District follows\nbefore referring students to the special education program (e.g., presenting the student’s case to\nthe Student Support Team, etc.); the process that the District uses to identify and refer students to\nthe special education program; special education services that may be available to students who\nqualify for such services; and student and parental rights that relate to the special education\nprogram;\n3.  The District will monitor the special education program each semester during\neach school year to ensure that the program is being administered fairly and without regard to\nrace.  To carry out its monitoring responsibilities, the District will collect and review data from\neach school about the race and number of students who are referred to the special education\nprogram and about race and number of students who are classified as Educable Mentally\nPage 13 of 21\n\nDisabled (“EMD”) or as having a Specific Learning Disability (“SLD”).  If the District, through\nits review, identifies data that indicate that high numbers of students of one race in specific\nschools (taking into account each school’s racial demographics) are being referred to the special\neducation program or are being classified as EMD or SLD, the District will investigate to\ndetermine the cause(s) of the high rate of referrals and/or EMD/SLD classifications among\nstudents of the race in question and, if appropriate, take steps to address the cause(s), including,\nbut not limited to, ensuring that personnel are following Student Support Team procedures, and\nproviding staff development on identifying, referring and evaluating students for the special\neducation program; and\n4.  At the end of each school year, the District will identify any schools in the\ndistrict, or in other comparable school districts, that have developed procedures or practices that\nhave assisted the school in accurately identifying, referring and evaluating students for the special\neducation program, and will ensure that all schools in the District receive information about\nthose practices and procedures.\nF.  Student Dropouts\nThe District will take the following steps to address the high numbers of black students\nwho drop out of school before obtaining their high school diploma:\n1.  The District will implement a dropout prevention plan at each school that will\ninclude initiatives for identifying and providing academic and other appropriate assistance to\nstudents at risk of not completing their high school education;\n2.  The District will ensure that, at each middle and high school operated by the\nDistrict, each student receives guidance, individually or in a small-group setting, from a teacher\nPage 14 of 21\n\nor counselor about the student’s academic career.  The guidance provided should include, but is\nnot limited to, information about high school course options and selection, study skills, and\nopportunities for academic assistance or enrichment;\n3.  The District will monitor dropout data each semester.  To carry out its\nmonitoring responsibilities, the District will collect and review data about the race and number of\nstudents who drop out of each middle and high school.  If the District, through its review,\nidentifies data that indicate that high numbers of black students in specific schools (taking into\naccount each school’s racial demographics) are dropping out of school, the District will\ninvestigate to determine the cause(s) of the high dropout rate among black students at each\nschool in question and, if appropriate, take steps to address the cause(s), such as supplementing\nthe measures outlined in the school’s dropout prevention plan; and\n4.  At the end of each school year, the District will identify any schools in the\ndistrict, or in other comparable school districts, that have developed procedures or practices that\nhave assisted the school in substantially reducing its dropout rate, and will ensure that all schools\nin the District that serve similar grade levels receive information about those practices and\nprocedures.\nIV.  MONITORING AND REPORTING\nThe District will submit to the Court, and to counsel of record for all parties, annual\nreports fully detailing its efforts to comply with the provisions of this Order until such time as the\nDistrict’s school system is declared unitary.

      "text": ",C-_  f\\ \n\"'  ·,i \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA ~ : \n. \nWESTERN DIVISION \n. \nCivil Action No. 1796 \nHAROLD DOUGLAS COPPEDGE, et al.,  ) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n) \nlJNITED STATES OF ANIERICA,  ) \nPlaintiff Intervenor  ) \n) \nv.  )  ORDER \n) \nTHE FRANKLIN COUNTY BOARD OF  ) \nEDUCA TION,  ) \nDefendant.  ) \nThis matter is before the court upon motion by Defendant Franklin County Board of \nEducation (the \"Board\") to dismiss court supervision of its desegregation efforts.  On April 17, \n2000, the Board filed a 5-page memorandum in support of dismissal, to which the plaintiff and \nthe Government responded, and the matter is now ripe for disposition. \nI \nThis long-lived desegregation action was initiated by the plaintiffs on December 8, 1965. \nBeginning in August 1967, the court issued a series of orders requiring the Board to submit \nannual repons and data regarding, among other things, teacher hiring, nonrenewal \nrecommendations, course offerings, faculty assignment, and student assignment.  In 1996, the \nGovernment intervened in this case, visited Franklin County School District (the \"District\"), and \nconcluded that the District was in noncompliance with several aspects of the court's orders.  As a \nresult of the District's alleged noncompliance, a consent order was entered by the undersigned on \nJune 14, 1996.  In that order, the Board agreed to take the following steps to address areas of \nThe Board did not file a reply memorandum. \nI \n\nnoncompliance: (l) maintain July 1995 student assignment zones for the 1996-97 school year; \n(2) maintain 1995-96 minority enrollment rates for the 1996-97 school year; (3) revise the \nstudent assignment plan for new middle schools, Bunn and Franklinton; (4) maintain enrollments \nin the two new middle schools within ±15% of the overall student population; (5) desegregate \nelementary schools to the extent practicable; (6) make the renovation or relocation of Louisburg \nElementary School the first priority after new middle school construction; (7) ensure \nimplementation and publication of majority-to-minority transfer policy, including provision of \ntransportation; (8) ensure that certified and non-certified staff assigned to each school do not \ncontribute to the racial identifiability of any school; (9) ensure that schools have an equitable \ndistribution of experienced staff; and (10) maintain the number of African-American certified \nand non-cenified personnel at ± 10 % of the district-wide averages within each school level for \nblack personnel.  See June 14, 1996, Consent Oider. \nThe Board now contends that court supervision of its desegregation efforts should be \ndismissed because the District has achieved unitary status.  Having carefully considered each \nparty's brief, the court is persuaded by the Government's reasoning and, except as specifically \nnoted below, ADOPTS and INCORPORATES the same herein as the predicate for this order. \nBased on that reasoning, the court finds that the District has achieved unitary status in the \nfollowing areas: (1) school transportation; (2) extracurricular activities; (3) school construction \nand facilities; (4) student transfers; and (5) faculty desegregation.  Accordingly, the Board's \nmotion to dismiss is ALLOWED as it relates to these five areas. \nWith respect to the other areas, the court finds that, as explained by the Government, the \nDistrict has not achieved unitary status in terms of quality of education or desegregation of staff. \n2 \n\nIn addition, unlike the Government, the court is unable to conclude at this time that unitary status \nhas been achieved in the area of student assignments.  The court is particularly troubled by the \nfact that the proportion of African-American students in three out of the six elementary schools is \nnot within ± 15% ofthe District-wide proportion of African-American students.2  Accordingly, \nthe Board's motion to dismiss is DENIED as it relates to these three areas. \nFinally, the court adopts the Government's proposed schedule to address the remaining \nareas of concern.  Specifically, the parties are now DIRECTED to adhere to the following \nschedule: \nl.  The Board shall have forty-five (45) days from the date of this order to develop \nproposals  remedy the aforementioned areas of noncompliance and \nto \ncommunicate the same to the plaintiff and the Government. \n2.  The plaintiff and the Government shall have forty-five (45) days to respond to \nthe Board's remedy proposals. \n3.  After both the plaintiff and Government have responded, the parties shall have \nthirty (30) days to negotiate and attempt to resolve all remaining issues. \n4.  At the end of that 30-day period, the parties shall apprise the court of their \nprogress and submit to the court either (1) a proposed consent decree or (2) a \nstatement of unresolved issues and a request for a hearing. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board's motion to dismiss is ALLOWED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART. \nAlthough the court recognizes that the 1996 consent order required only that the \n2 \nDistrict's elementary schools become desegregated to the extent practicable, the Board has given \nno explanation for why three of the six elementary schools remain racially identifiable. \n3 \n\nSO ORDERED. \n11 \nThis the J-tday of June, 2002. \nJAMES C.
