At The Classical Center at Brandenburg Middle School, there are currently \n740 magnet students enrolled for the fall.  Included will be 260 sixth graders, \n241 seventh graders, and 239 eighth graders.  Of the total number, 310 \n(41.89%) will be White; 108 (14.59%) will be Black; 54 (7.30%) will be Asian; 1 \n(0.14%) will be American Indian; 247 (33.38%) will be Hispanic; and 20 \n(2.70%) will be two or more races or ethnicities. \n\nCase 3:70-cv-04100-K   Document 33   Filed 06/18/13    Page 5 of 6   PageID 2435\nJudge Ed Kinkeade \nPage 4 \nJune 15, 2013 \nI.  Lakeview Centennial High School's College-Career-Connect component has \n1,185 students enrolled in the fall.  Included are 289 ninth graders, 288 tenth \ngraders, 281 eleventh graders, and 327 twelfth graders.  Of this total number, \n335 (28.27%) will be White; 298 (25.15%) will be Black; 63 (5.32%) will be \nAsian; 8 (0.68%) will be American Indian; 460 (38.82%) will be Hispanic; and \n21  (1.77%) will be two or more races or ethnicities. \nSee Exhibit 2. \n3.  After the thirty-day Freedom of Choice ended, it became necessary to mail letters \nto parents of 1,419, students asking them to make a second choice of school. \n(This figure compares with 1,771 a year ago.)  These letters went to parents at 44 \nelementary schools (577 students), 12 middle schools (512 students), and 7 high \nschools (330 students). \nSee Exhibit 3. \n4.  At the present time, enrollment restrictions have been put in place at all \nelementary schools, 9 middle schools, and 4 high schools.  After the 2013-14 \nchoice of school results, the district has no schools below the Anglo standard of \nthe ethnic band.  Two schools are above the Anglo standard of the ethnic band \nafter our 2013-14 choice process.  These schools are Armstrong Elementary \nSchool (45.9%) and Keeley Elementary School (58.9%).  Students seeking \nenrollment at a closed school are placed on a waiting list if the parents so request. \nMany of them will ultimately be accepted when other students fail to show up \nwhen school starts. \nSee Exhibits 4 and 5. \n5.  Current pre-enrollment figures at each school indicate an Anglo range of 2.5% \n(Bullock) at the low end to 58.9% (Keeley). \nSee Exhibit 5. \n6.  Transportation costs associated with the Court Order are estimated at \n$5,723,279.00 for 2012-13 and $5,960,194.00 in 2013-14. \nSee Exhibit 6. \n7.  The Personnel Department recruited at six predominantly Black colleges in \nTexas, three predominantly Black out-of-state universities, and five predominantly \nHispanic institutions during the 2012-2013 school year. \nSee Exhibit 7. \n\nCase 3:70-cv-04100-K   Document 33   Filed 06/18/13    Page 6 of 6   PageID 2436\nJudge Ed Kinkeade \nPage 5 \nJune 15, 2013 \n8.  The District is in compliance with the Court directive to solicit scholarships for \nminority students.  In May 2013,964 scholarships were awarded to minority \nstudents at a total value of $14,215,541. \nSee Exhibit 8. \nRespectfully submitted, \n~or~~~ \nBM/jm \nCopy:  Robert E.
