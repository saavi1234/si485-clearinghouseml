The plaintiffs, represented through their legal guardians by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the closing of two residential care facilities where the plaintiffs resided. The claims argued that the planned closures would violate the plaintiffs' rights or result in situations where violation of those rights would occur. </p><p>Specifically, in regard to the ADA claims, the plaintiffs claimed that discharges or transfers from their current residences were being forced without their consent and without appropriate recommendation from treating professionals. This, they argued, violated the plaintiffs' rights under the ADA and entitled them to the relief sought. The plaintiffs claimed that their discharge or transfer from their current residence would violate the RA's integration requirement. Further, that the State utilized criteria and methods of administration that subjected the plaintiffs to discrimination based on their disability. In regards to the Medicaid claim made through the Social Security Act, the plaintiffs claimed the State failed to ensure the plaintiffs needs and preferences were being met in their multidisciplinary plan. The plaintiffs claim that the discharge process, and its lack of safeguards to prevent harm to the plaintiffs, violated plaintiffs' rights not to be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law. </p><p>On September 9, 2013, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The United States of America additionally filed a statement of interest arguing that plaintiffs failed to state a cause under the ADA and RA. On December 13, 2013, the District Court (Judge Stanley R. Chesler) granted the defendant's motion to dismiss. The court found that each claim either did not meet the factual standard required in pleading or that, in the case of the Medicaid claim, the cited statues did not apply to private actions. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order on motion to dismiss on January 10, 2014. Following appellate arguments before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on the motion to dismiss, Circuit Court Judge Thomas M. Hardiman (joined by Circuit Judges Fisher and Jordon) entered an order determining the case to be moot. All plaintiffs at the facilities in question were transferred to alternative care facilities, making the issues presented in this case no longer live.</p>",

The statute, regulations, and established precedent \ndo not support the Plaintiffs’ claim that the ADA gives them a right to remain in a particular \ninstitution and prevent the State from integrating persons with disabilities into a community \nsetting as mandated by Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 591-592 (1999).   \nIn 1990, Congress enacted the ADA “to provide a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12101(b)(1).  Congress recognized that “historically, society has tended to isolate and \nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and despite some improvements, such forms of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social \nproblem.”  Id. § 12101(a)(2).  For these reasons, Congress prohibited discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities by public entities:   \n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity. \n \n                                                           \n1 Under 28 U.S.C. § 517, “[t]he Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department of \nJustice, may be sent by the Attorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend \nto the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States, or in a court \nof a State, or to attend to any other interest of the United States.” \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 7   Filed 09/13/13   Page 6 of 12 PageID: 173\nId. § 12132.  In passing the ADA, Congress sought to create strong national standards to \naddress discrimination and to ensure that the federal government played a “central role” \nin creating and enforcing those standards. 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2) & (3).   \nCongress instructed the Attorney General, in 42 U.S.C. § 12134, to issue regulations to \nimplement the ADA’s broad mandate to end the pervasive and ongoing segregation of persons \nwith disabilities in all facets of life.  See 42 U.S.C. §12101(a)(2).  Title II’s integration regulation \nrequires public entities to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(d).2  The “most integrated setting” means one that “enables individuals with disabilities \nto interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.…” 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B at \n673.   \nThe Supreme Court in Olmstead interpreted these regulations to mean that “[u]njustified \nisolation” of individuals with disabilities “is properly regarded as discrimination based on \ndisability.”  Olmstead, 526 U.S. at 596-597.  The Court held that public entities are required to \nprovide community-based services to persons with disabilities when (a) such services are \nappropriate; (b) the affected persons do not oppose community-based treatment; and \n(c) community-based services can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the \nresources available to the entity and the needs of others who are receiving disability services \nfrom the entity.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 607.   \nThe Department has interpreted the integration regulation to prohibit the unnecessary \nprovision of such services to persons with disabilities in segregated institutional settings, in \n                                                           \n2 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, contains a nearly identical \nregulation issued by the Attorney General.  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).  These regulations have been \nread in tandem to provide similar protections to persons with disabilities.  See Olmstead v. L.C., \n527 U.S. at 590-592.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 7   Filed 09/13/13   Page 7 of 12 PageID: 174\nwhich persons with disabilities have little to no opportunity to interact with non-disabled \npersons.  See, e.g., “Statement of the Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration \nMandate of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C.” at 3 (June 22, \n2011), available at:  http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm.   \nAs the agency charged by Congress with enforcing and implementing regulations under \nTitle II, the Department’s interpretation of both Title II and the integration regulation has been \naccorded substantial deference.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597-98; (“Because the Department is \nthe agency directed by Congress to issue regulations implementing Title II, its views warrant \nrespect.” (citation omitted)); Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 322 (4th Cir. 2013) (“Because \nCongress instructed the DOJ to issue regulations regarding Title II, we are especially swayed by \nthe DOJ's [interpretation of] ‘the ADA and the Olmstead decision’”) (internal citation omitted); \nM.R. v.

The Department’s interpretation of the integration \nregulation must be upheld “unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.”  Auer v. \nRobbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997) (citations omitted).   \nII. ARGUMENT \nThe ADA Does Not Create a Right to Remain in a Particular Institution \n \n  In June 2011, the State enacted a statute creating a task force to evaluate the State’s seven \ndevelopmental centers and issue recommendations with respect to closing one or more of those \ncenters.  Act establishing \"Task Force on the Closure of State Developmental Centers,\" P.L. \n2011, Chapter 143 (available at http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2010/Bills/S3000/2928_I1.HTM).  \nOn August 1, 2012, the task force issued a final report with a binding recommendation to close \nthe North Jersey Developmental Center (NJDC) and the Woodbridge Developmental Center \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 7   Filed 09/13/13   Page 8 of 12 PageID: 175\n(WDC) within the next five years.  Final Report as Submitted to Governor Chris Christie and the \nNew Jersey Legislature (available at https://dspace.njstatelib.org/xmlui/handle/10929/21105).   \nPlaintiffs oppose such recommendations, essentially contending that the ADA, an \nintegration statute enacted to end the pervasive segregation of persons with disabilities, conveys \na right to remain in a segregated institution, as opposed to a right to live in the community.  See \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint at 40-44.  Yet, nothing in the ADA or its regulations, the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in Olmstead, or any other case law supports this interpretation of the ADA and its \nintegration mandate.  Nothing in the ADA statute or regulations or the Olmstead decision \nsupports Plaintiffs' concept that moving people with disabilities to appropriate integrated settings \nis similarly discriminatory or raises similar civil rights concerns.  Rather, the inverse is true.  \nIn Olmstead, the Supreme Court concluded that the unjustified institutionalization and \n \nisolation of persons with mental disabilities violates the ADA. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 581, 597. \nThe Supreme Court reached this conclusion based upon two “evident judgments.” Id. at 600. \nFirst, the Court observed that “institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit \nfrom community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are \nincapable or unworthy of participating in community life.” Id. at 600.  Second, the Court noted \nthat “confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, \nincluding family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational \nadvancement, and cultural enrichment.” Id. at 601. \n Plaintiffs make much of Olmstead’s statement that there is no “federal requirement that \ncommunity-based services be imposed upon those who do not desire them.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. \nat 602.  That statement means it is not an ADA requirement to place a person in a community \nbased setting if he or she opposes placement.  It does not mean integration or placement in \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 7   Filed 09/13/13   Page 9 of 12 PageID: 176\nanother institution is an ADA violation.  Moreover, to read that sentence in Olmstead as creating \na right to institutionalization would turn the ADA and its integration mandate on its head and \nimpermissibly create a new right under the ADA that was never intended by Congress.  Gonzaga \nUniv. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002) (Congress must “unambiguously confer a right” to \nsupport a cause of action under §1983 or an implied right of action.).  The ADA does not confer \na civil right to remain in any given institution.  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs’ argument contradicts established precedent that the ADA’s purpose is \nto prevent unnecessary institutionalization, not to require continued operation of a state \ninstitution in which an individual plaintiff currently resides.  Courts have found that it does not \nviolate federal law for states to close their institutions.  See generally Ricci v. Patrick, 544 F.3d \n8, 21 (1st Cir. 2008); Illinois League of Advocates for the Developmentally Disabled v. Patrick \nQuinn, Civ. No. 1:13-cv-01300, 9-10 (N.D. Ill. filed June 20, 2013) (Attached as Exhibit A) \n(memorandum opinion holding that placing individuals in the community is no basis for an \nOlmstead case).3   This is particularly true when a state is rebalancing its system of supports for \npeople with disabilities away from expensive institutional care towards community care to use its \nresources to serve more people.  See Ricci, 544 F.3d at 8, 17-18 n.8, 21 (recognizing a State’s \nability to close its state-operated facilities, particularly when “allocating its resources to ensure \nequitable treatment of its citizens,” and noting the ADA’s preference for community integration \nunder the Olmstead decision) (internal citations omitted); Richard C. v. Houstoun, 196 F.R.D. \n                                                           \n3 Medicaid law also does not require that States operate a particular institution.  States, \nlike New Jersey, that participate in Medicaid’s home and community-based waiver program \nmust offer participants the choice of community-based or institutional services, but those \ninstitutional services can be offered in a public institution (like a State Developmental Center) or \na private institution at the option of the state, 42 C.F.R. § 441.302(d).  Here, the State has \nprovided Plaintiffs who wish to receive services in another State Developmental Center the \noption to do so, which accords with their rights under Medicaid to choose a type of placement.   \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 7   Filed 09/13/13   Page 10 of 12 PageID: 177\n288, 291-292 (W.D. Pa. 1999) (rejecting plaintiffs’ interpretation of Olmstead to require \ncontinued institutionalization when the three Olmstead factors are not met and denying \nintervention); see also Baccus v. Parrish, 45 F. 3d 958, 961 (5th Cir. 1995) (State may close its \npublic institutions for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities); Lelsz v. \nKavangauh, 783 F.

See Benjamin v. Dep’t \nof Public Welfare of the Commonwealth of Pa., 432 F. App’x. 94, 98 (3d Cir. 2011) (affirming \ndenial of intervention motion where relief sought caused no “direct jeopardy” to plaintiffs’ \ncurrent form of institutional care); Benjamin ex rel. Yock v.

But a protectable interest permitting intervention does not equate to a court-\nenforceable federal right, Benjamin, 432 F. App’x. at 98 (citing Kleissler v. U.S. Forest Service, \n157 F.3d 964, 970 (3d Cir. 1998)), and the Third Circuit has not held that people living in a state-\noperated facility have a right to remain there.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 7   Filed 09/13/13   Page 11 of 12 PageID: 178\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \ns/Susan Handler-Menahem   s/ Christopher Cheng \nSUSAN HANDLER-MENAHEM  JONATHAN SMITH \nAssistant United States Attorney  Chief \nPeter Rodino Federal Building  MARY R.

Defendants1 have filed a motion to dismiss these \nclaims, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  [Docket Entry 4.]  Plaintiffs \noppose.  [Docket Entry 13.]  In addition, the United States of America has filed a Statement of \nInterest, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517, which argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state ADA and \n                                                           \n1 The Complaint names seven Defendants: Christopher Christie; the New Jersey Department of \nHuman Services (“NJ DHS”); Jennifer Velez, Commissioner of the NJ DHS; the New Jersey \nDepartment of Human Services Department of Developmental Disabilities (“NJ DDD”); Dawn \nApgar, Deputy Commission of the NJ DHS; North Jersey Developmental Center (“NJDC”); and \nWoodbridge Developmental Center (“WDC”).  This Opinion uses the terms “Defendants” and \n“State” interchangeably. \n\nRA causes of action.  [Docket Entry 7.]  The Court has considered these submissions, and will \nrule on the motion without oral argument, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 78.  For \nthe reasons that follow, Defendants’ motion will be granted, and the Complaint will be dismissed \nwith prejudice. \nI.  Background \nThis lawsuit arises out of the State of New Jersey’s decision to close two state-run \nresidential care facilities for the developmentally disabled, Woodbridge Developmental Center \n(“WDC”) in Middlesex County and North Jersey Developmental Center (“NJDC”) in Passaic \nCounty.  (See Compl. at ¶¶ 121-22.)  In broad terms, the Complaint alleges that Defendants are \n“downsize[ing] or depopulate[ing]” the NJDC and the WDC “without regard to the needs of the \nindividual Plaintiffs,” who are all profoundly disabled adults residing at one of the two Centers.  \n(See id. at ¶ 119.)  According to the Complaint, Defendants plan to move Plaintiffs out of WDC \nand NJDC; to this end, Defendants have offered Plaintiffs the choice between a “community \nplacement” – i.e., “small group homes, nursing homes, and other settings with smaller \npopulations” – and a move to a different Developmental Center located “over one hundred miles \naway.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 110, 118(d).)  Being moved out of the NJDC and WDC will result in the denial \nto Plaintiffs of “access to their current high level of treatment and services,” (id. at ¶ 130), and \nthe decision to close the two Centers has exposed or will expose Plaintiffs to a “significant risk \nof harm.”  (Id. at ¶ 90.) \nBy this lawsuit, Plaintiffs’ ask the Court to prevent their relocation, as well as the \nrelocation of a class of similarly situated individuals who have been residents of NJDC or WDC \nsince August 1, 2012.  Applying language from the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. \nL.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), Plaintiffs argue that an involuntary transfer out of \n2 \n \n\nNJDC or WDC constitutes discrimination in violation of Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, \nas well as § 504 of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  According to Plaintiffs, Olmstead provides them \na right to oppose the State of New Jersey’s decision to move them from institutional care to a \nmore integrated community setting.  (See Compl. ¶ 132-35 (“there is no ‘federal requirement that \ncommunity-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it’” (quoting Olmstead, \n527 U.S. at 602).) \nPlaintiffs also seek relief pursuant to (1) the Medicaid portions of the Social Security Act \nand related regulations, and (2) the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  As to the \nformer, the Complaint alleges that Medicaid provides Plaintiffs with a host of rights – including \nthe right to oppose a “discharge or transfer” from NJDC or WDC – and also prevents Defendants \nfrom moving Plaintiffs to facilities that are “significantly distant” from family members or \nguardians.  (See id. at 47-50.)  As to the latter, the Complaint alleges what amounts to two \nseparate theories of liability.  First, Defendants will violate Plaintiffs’ substantive due process \nrights by moving Plaintiffs to non-institutionalized residences that will “substantially increase \n[Plaintiffs’] likelihood of injury and death from abuse, neglect, error, lack of appropriate \nservices, and other causes.”  (See id. ¶¶ 168-71.)  Second, Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process rights by providing inferior care for Plaintiffs’ safety and well-being \nduring the downsizing of NJDC and WDC.  (See id. ¶¶ 172-74.) \nII.  Discussion \nA.  Legal Standard \nA complaint will survive a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) only if it states “sufficient factual \nallegations, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 554, 570 (2007)). \n3 \n \n\n“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. (citing \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  Following Iqbal and Twombly, the Third Circuit has held that, to \nprevent dismissal of a claim, the complaint must show, through the facts alleged, that the \nplaintiff is entitled to relief.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2009).  \nWhile the Court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it need \nnot accept a “legal conclusion couched as factual allegation.” Baraka v. McGreevey, 481 F.3d \n187, 195 (3d Cir. 2007); Fowler, 578 F.3d at 210-11; see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (“While \nlegal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual \nallegations.”).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \nconclusory statements, will not suffice.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nB.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act Claims2 \nThe ADA was enacted in 1990 “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate \nfor the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”   42 U.S.C. § \n12101(b).  The ADA recognizes that “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate \nindividuals with disabilities, and despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  Id. § \n12101(a)(2).  Consistent with this statement of purpose, Title II of the ADA prohibits \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities by public entities: “no qualified individual \nwith a disability shall, by reasons of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \n                                                           \n2 The parties treat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims as interchangeable for purposes of this \nmotion.  This Court will do the same.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 590-92 (noting the similarities \nbetween 42 U.S.C. § 12131 and the RA and that the regulations implementing § 12131 are \nmodeled after those implementing § 504 of the RA); Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare of \nCommonwealth of Pa., 364 F.3d 487, 490 n.2 (3d Cir. 2004) (acknowledging the “congruence” \nof the ADA and RA “integration mandates”). \n4 \n \n\ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by any such entity.”  Id. § 12132.  Title II’s integration regulation, promulgated \nby the Attorney General, requires public entities to “administer services, programs, and activities \nin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  The “most integrated setting” is defined as one that “enables individuals \nwith disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible . . . .”  28 \nC.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B at 673. \nIn Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, the Supreme Court addressed the question of \nwhether the ADA’s “proscription of discrimination may require placement of persons with \nmental disabilities in community settings rather than institutions.”  527 U.S. at 587.  The Court \nheld that the answer to that question was a qualified yes: under Title II “[u]njustified isolation” in \nan institution can, in certain circumstances, be “properly regarded as discrimination based on \ndisability.”  527 U.S. at 597.  The Court provided a three factor analysis to determine when a \nState must place a mentally disabled individual in a community setting, as opposed to an \ninstitution:  \n[1] when the State’s treatment professionals have determined that \ncommunity placement is appropriate, [2] the transfer from \ninstitutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the \naffected individual, and [3] the placement can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the \nState and the needs of others with mental disabilities.  \nId. \nIn support of its holding, the Court noted the shift in congressional policy towards \ntreating disabled individuals in “state-run home and community based care,” and away from \ninstitutionalized treatment.  See id. at 601 (stating that Medicaid provides funding for such \nprograms through a waiver and that the Department of Health and Human Services encourages \n5 \n \n\nstates “to take advantage of the waiver program”).  But the Court, in dicta, was careful to observe \nthat (1) “nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones” forcing disabled persons \ninto community settings when they are “unable to handle or benefit” from them, and (2) there is \nno “federal requirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not \ndesire it.”  See id. at 601-02; see also id. at 604 (“the ADA is not reasonably read to impel States \nto phase out institutions, placing patients in need of close care at risk”).  To this end, Olmstead \ninstructed States to rely on “the reasonable assessments” of their own treating professionals to \ndetermine if disabled individuals are eligible for “habilitation in a community-based program.”  \nId. at 602. \nOlmstead thus stands for the proposition that “it is a violation of the [ADA, the RA,] and \ntheir implementing regulations to force developmentally disabled patients to reside in institutions \nwhen they are able and willing to live” in more integrated community settings.  See Benjamin ex \nrel. Yock v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare of Pa., 701 F.3d 938, 942 (3d Cir. 2012).  To substantiate their \nADA and RA claims, however, Plaintiffs seize on the above dicta and argue that Olmstead \nstands for a somewhat related but entirely distinct proposition – that a State cannot move a \ndevelopmentally disabled person from their current institution to a community setting unless the \nSupreme Court’s three-factor analysis is met.  (See Opp. Br. at 15-16).  In Plaintiffs’ view, the \nState of New Jersey cannot close the NJDC or WDC until every resident at those facilities \nconsents to a transfer and a treatment professional has determined that another facility – \ninstitutional or community-based – is “the most appropriate place to receive services.”  (See id. \nat 15.)3 \n                                                           \n3 Plaintiffs argue that they do not seek to prevent the State of New Jersey from closing the NJDC \nand WDC, and instead seek enforcement of “rights [that] may prevent the move of some \nresidents from [WDC] and [NJDC] . . . .”  (See Opp. Br. at 2.)  This is a distinction without a \n6 \n \n\nPlaintiffs’ interpretation of Olmstead is untenable.  Simply put, “there is no basis [in \nOlmstead] for saying that a premature discharge into the community is an ADA discrimination \nbased on disability.”  Richard S. v. Dep’t of Developmental Servs. of the State of Cal., No. 97-\ncv-219, 2000 WL 35944246, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2000) (emphasis in original).  Indeed, \n“[t]here is no ADA provision that providing community placement is a discrimination.  It may be \na bad medical decision, or poor policy, but it is not discrimination based on disability.”  Id. \n(emphasis in original).  This Court will therefore join the numerous other federal courts have \nrejected similar “obverse Olmstead” arguments in circumstances where a State has decided to \nclose treatment facilities for the developmentally disabled or relocate such disabled individuals \nto community settings.  See, e.g., Richard C. ex rel. Kathy B. v. Houstoun, 196 F.R.D. 288, 292 \n(W.D. Pa. 1999) (rejecting interpretation of Olmstead identical to the one proffered in this case \nand finding that “it does not logically follow [from Olmstead] that institutionalization is required \nif any of the three Olmstead criteria is not met”); Ill. League of Advocates for the \nDevelopmentally, Disabled v. Quinn, No. 13-cv-1300, 2013 WL 3168758, at *5 (N.D. Ill. June \n20, 2013) (noting, in case brought to enjoin the State of Illinois from closing development \ncenters, that “[u]njustified isolation constitutes discrimination under the ADA, but” Olmstead \ndoes not mean the converse is true).4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \ndifference, as the practical result of Plaintiffs successfully enjoining the State from moving \nresidents out of the Centers would obviously force those Centers to remain open. \n4 The Third Circuit, in the context of a motion for intervention under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 24, has “assum[ed], without deciding” that a group of institutionalized mentally \ndisabled individuals who oppose community placement “ha[s] a legally enforceable right to \nremain in the institution where they currently reside.”  See Benjamin ex rel. Yock v. Dep't of \nPub. Welfare of Pa., 432 F. App'x 94, 98 & n.4 (3d Cir. 2011) (denying Rule 24 intervention).  \nIn a later decision in the Benjamin litigation, the Third Circuit granted the Rule 24 intervention \nof the same group of individuals at the remedy stage, holding that the “protectable interests” of \ninstitutionalized individuals “may be affected” by a Settlement Agreement that fosters \nintegration through institutional discharge.  See 701 F.3d at 957 (3d Cir. 2012).  But a right \nsufficient to warrant intervention does not a discrimination cause of action make.  Absent more \n7 \n \n\nThe Court is sensitive to the difficulties faced by institutionalized individuals and their \nfamilies; for instance, it appears from the Complaint that Plaintiffs and their families have grown \naccustomed to receiving state-provided care at the two institutions New Jersey has marked for \nclosure.  Plaintiffs’ concerns, however, are concerns which are appropriately directed to the State \nagencies involved.  The Court’s analysis is limited to whether the controlling statutes relied upon \nby Plaintiffs have been violated, and it does not appear that Plaintiffs’ relocation amounts to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in violation of federal law.  As such, the Complaint fails \nto state a claim for violation of the ADA and RA, and those causes of action must be dismissed. \nC.  The Medicaid Claim \nThe Complaint also alleges that relocating residents of NJDC and WDC violates several \nprovisions of the Social Security Act’s Medicaid portions and their implementing regulations.  \nThe Complaint cites six provisions of the United States Code and the Code of Federal \nRegulations: 42 U.S.C § 1396n; 42 C.F.R. § 441.302(d); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10); 42 U.S.C. § \n1396d(a)(15); 42 C.F.R. § 483.440(b)(3); and 42 C.F.R. § 483.440(a)(1).  Plaintiffs allege that \nthis laundry list of statutes and regulations hangs upon Defendants various duties, which will all \nbe violated by relocating Plaintiffs from NJDC and WDC.   \nThe Medicaid claim must fail.  Save for the rights contemplated by 42 U.S.C. §§ \n1396a(a)(10) and 1396d(a)(15), Plaintiffs do not cite a provision of Medicaid that they can \nenforce through a private 42 U.S.C. § 1983 cause of action.  See Sabree ex rel. Sabree v. \nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 182-83 (3d Cir. 2004) (“[i]n legislation enacted pursuant to the spending \npower, the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \ndirect guidance from the Third Circuit, the Court will follow the plain language of the Olmstead \ndecision itself and the other federal courts that have applied Olmstead to reject ADA arguments \nidentical to the one currently before the Court. \n \n8 \n \n\nprivate cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to \nterminate funds to the State” (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, \n28 (1981))).5  It is Plaintiffs’ burden to establish that the federal statute cited “gives rise to \nfederal rights enforceable through § 1983.”  Grammer v. John J. Kane Regional Centers-Glen \nHazel, 570 F.3d 520, 525 (3d Cir. 2009).  But Plaintiffs’ Opposition brief makes no argument \nwhatsoever as to whether the litany of Medicaid statutes and regulations cited in the Complaint \nindividually pass a Gonzaga University v. Doe analysis and can therefore be enforced privately \npursuant to § 1983.  See Sabree, 367 F.3d at 183 (quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 \n(2002)). \nIf §§ 1396a(a)(10) and 1396d(a)(15) were applicable to this case the outcome might be \ndifferent, insofar as the Third Circuit has explicitly held that those subsections are privately \nenforceable in § 1983 suits.  See Sabree, 367 F.3d at 183.  But the two provisions are not \nrelevant here.  Section 1396a(a)(10) requires “[a] State plan for medical assistance” to provide . . \n. for making medical assistance . . . available, . . . to all [eligible] individuals . . . .”  Nowhere in \nthe Complaint do Plaintiffs allege that the State is not making medical assistance available to \nthem.  Instead, the Complaint takes issue with the type of medical assistance allegedly provided \nat facilities other than NJDC and WDC.   \nLikewise, § 1396d(a)(15) requires states to provide medical assistance in the form of \npayment for at least some of the “services [received by individuals] in an intermediate care \nfacility” for the developmentally disabled.  Again, the Complaint does not say that Defendants \nare violating federal law by failing to pay for intermediate care facilities like NJDC and WDC, \n                                                           \n5 Indeed, Plaintiffs fail to bring their Medicaid claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the vehicle \nprovided by Congress for private vindication of rights that may be created by statutes such as \nMedicaid.  See Sabree, 367 F.3d at 183.  Having found the Medicaid claim is meritless, the Court \nwill proceed as if Plaintiffs have properly brought suit pursuant to § 1983. \n9 \n \n\nonly that Plaintiffs have a federal right to the intermediate care facility of their choosing.  Indeed, \nPlaintiffs argue that “Defendants have no right to assume all [intermediate care facilities] are \nequal or provide necessary services.”  (Opp. Br. at 20.)  But all that § 1396d(a)(15) requires is for \nthe State of New Jersey to pay for some or all of the services provided to disabled individuals at \nsuch facilities, not to offer disabled individuals a choice to receive care at the facility that they \nperceive to be superior. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ Medicaid claim relies on federal law that is not enforceable in private \nlawsuits and statutes that are irrelevant to the complained of conduct.  It will therefore be \ndismissed. \nD.  The Due Process Claim \nPlaintiffs final claim is one for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; it alleges that the \ndecision to close NJDC and WDC and relocate Plaintiffs from their residences there violates \nPlaintiffs’ substantive due process rights.  To state a cause of action under § 1983, a plaintiff \nmust “allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, \nand must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of \nstate law.”  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).  The Complaint and both parties’ briefs treat \nthe due process claim as one that rests solely on the substantive due process rights to protection \nand care enunciated in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).   \nIn Youngberg, the Supreme Court addressed “the substantive [due process] rights of \ninvoluntarily committed” developmentally disabled individuals.  Id. at 314.  Youngberg held that \n“these substantive rights include a qualified right to safe conditions and freedom from bodily \nrestraint.”   Fialkowski v. Greenwich Home for Children, Inc., 921 F.2d 459, 465 (3d Cir. 1990).  \nOf course, due process “generally confer[s] no affirmative right to governmental aid.”  See \n10 \n \n\nDeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989).  Youngberg rights, \nhowever, “fit within an exception providing that ‘when the State takes a person into its custody \nand holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to \nassume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.’”  Torisky v. Schweiker, 466 \nF.3d 438, 444 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 199-200).  As stated earlier, a fair \nreading of the Complaint reveals that Plaintiffs in fact bring two separate but related Youngberg \nclaims – for harm that might arise if Plaintiffs are transferred to community-based facilities, and \nfor harm that has already occurred based on inadequate staffing at NJDC and WDC. \nThe due process claim fails under either theory.  Plaintiffs cannot state a plausible \nYoungberg claim based on speculative future harm that might result if Plaintiffs are placed in \ncommunity-based settings.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 168-71.)  Such a result is foreclosed by Fialkowski, \nin which the Third Circuit held that a developmentally disabled individual did not have his \n“personal liberty . . . substantially curtailed by the state” in a manner sufficient to implicate \nYoungberg when the individual was moved from a state institution to a group home and choked \nto death at that location.  See 921 F.2d at 465.  In support of its holding, the Fialkowski Court \nnoted that the individual’s family “could remove their son from the [group home] if they wished” \nand that the individual “himself enjoyed considerable freedom of movement.”  See id. at 465-66.  \nThere is no indication from the Complaint or otherwise that identical considerations would not \ngovern here.  Thus, any harm that might occur to Plaintiffs in a group home setting would not be \nharm visited while Plaintiffs were “deprived of freedom ‘through . . . institutionalization or other \nsimilar restraint of personal liberty,’” and thus would not be actionable under the Due Process \nClause.  See id. at 466 (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S at 200); see also Campbell v. State of Wash. \nDep’t of Soc. and Health Servs., 671 F.3d 837, 843-45 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that a mentally \n11 \n \n\ndisabled adult’s residence in a state-run alternative-living facility is not involuntary \nconfinement).  In short, the freedom inherent in a community-based residence and the \ncurtailment of personal liberty necessary to state a Youngberg claim are entirely dissimilar.  The \ndue process claim, insofar as it seeks liability for harm that might occur while Plaintiffs reside in \nstate-funded community settings, is dismissed. \nAs to Plaintiffs’ second theory, the Complaint fails to plead facts sufficient to make out a \nplausible Youngberg claim based on the alleged reduction in services at NJDC and WDC.  See \nIqbal, 556 at 678.  Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants “have significantly contributed to and \nincreased the vulnerability of the Plaintiffs [living at NJDC and WDC] and created risks that \nwould not have otherwise existed if Defendants complied with their legal duties.”  (See Compl. \nat ¶ 173.)  But as Defendants correctly argue, Plaintiffs support their claim with nothing more \nthan “sweeping legal conclusions derived from Youngberg,” not specific facts.  (Mov. Br. at 20 \n(noting the allegation that the medical services provided by Defendant have “substantially \ndeparted from generally accepted professional standards” (quoting Compl. ¶ 85)).)  Such \nallegations cannot survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion under contemporary pleading standards. \nPlaintiffs’ argument to the contrary is baffling.  Plaintiffs do not attempt to highlight \nspecific facts to substantiate a plausible claim that the State has failed to confine them under \n“conditions of reasonable care and safety . . . .”  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324.  Instead, Plaintiffs \nlift a three-and-a-half page block quote out of their Complaint and insert it into their brief, \nthereafter noting that “[t]hese allegations are sufficient notice pleading.”  (Opp. Br. at 23-26.)  \nThe Court would overlook this approach, if the block-quoted portion of the Complaint was not \nrife with the sort of conclusory allegations that cannot serve to state a plausible claim.  As just \none example, Paragraph 79 states that the “provision of protection from harm mechanisms, since \n12 \n \n\nthe decision to close the developmental centers, has in some instances substantially departed \nfrom generally accepted professional standards.”  Indeed, in the nineteen paragraphs of the \nComplaint reproduced in Plaintiffs’ brief, the Court can only find one instance where Plaintiffs \nallege facts relevant to stating a plausible Youngberg claim.  (See Compl. ¶ 89 (describing a \nphysical attack on a Plaintiff by another resident allegedly resulting from “lack of staffing”).)  \nBut one alleged resident on resident attack does not substantiate a plausible claim for due process \nviolations occurring at two separate state-run facilities that house severely disabled adults.6 \nThe Youngberg claim based on current conditions at NJDC and WDC also fails for the \ndistinct reason that the Complaint does not plead facts to indicate that Plaintiffs are in any way \ninvoluntarily housed at the two facilities.  As stated above, Youngberg rights – i.e., “[t]he \naffirmative duty to protect” – arise only where the state has taken an “affirmative act of \nrestraining the individual’s freedom to act on his own behalf . . . .”  See DeShaney, 489 U.S. at \n200.  Plaintiffs, however, do not argue that Defendants in this case have taken steps to \naffirmatively confine them to NJDC or WDC.  Rather, Plaintiffs argue that they are “totally \ndependent on the medical and habilitative care provided by the State [at NJDC and WDC], and \nthey cannot decline services at any time without jeopardizing their health, safety, and well-\nbeing.”  (Opp. Br. at 32-33.)  To this end, the Third Circuit has indeed recognized, if not held, \nthat otherwise voluntarily committed patients may in certain circumstances “find themselves in a \nde facto involuntary status” for the purposes of Youngberg.  See Torisky, 446 F.3d at 447-48 \n(holding that the trial court erred when it concluded that “the state owes an affirmative due \nprocess duty of care to residents of a state institution who are free to leave state custody”). \nBut this case is not one of those circumstances.  The Torisky decision, for instance, \naffirmed an order denying a motion to dismiss where the complaint alleged that the \n                                                           \n6 Paragraph 89 in fact fails to state if the alleged attack took place at NJDC or WDC. \n13 \n \n\ndevelopmentally disabled plaintiffs were, while in state custody, “separated from their guardians \n. . . by a police blockade” and were “transferred against their will” by state employees who \naffirmatively utilized “physical and psychological force . . . .”  See id. at 448.  The Complaint in \nthis case is bereft of facts that reveal similar affirmative acts of physical or mental restraint by \nthe Defendants or their agents.  Torisky itself cites to a case from the First Circuit that analyzes \nand squarely rejects the theory that an institutionalized individual can be de facto involuntarily \nconfined because of the profoundness of his disabilities.  See id. at 447 (quoting Monahan v. \nDorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc., 961 F.2d 987, 992 (1st Cir. 1992)).  Much like Plaintiffs here, \nthe plaintiff in Monahan argued that he was “de facto a ward of the state” based on, inter alia, \nhis “degree of disability” and “the availability of other resources and of . . . guardians . . . .”  See \n961 F.2d at 992.  The First Circuit, however, rebuffed this argument.  The court noted that the \ncomplaint did not allege that plaintiff was somehow “barred” from leaving the state facility \nwhere he was housed.  Monahan found that even if the plaintiff’s “mental condition . . . made \nhim functionally dependent on his [state] caretakers . . . it was [plaintiff’s] own mental condition \nalone that impinged upon his freedom to leave.”  As such, “it was not the state that deprived him \nof that freedom,” and the Constitution therefore “did not impose upon [the state] any \nresponsibility for [plaintiff’s] safety and well-being.”  Id. at 992 (citing DeShaney, 489 U.S. at \n199-200); see also Randolph v. Cervantes, 130 F.3d 727, 730 (5th Cir. 1997) (“the mere fact that \n[plaintiff’s] mental condition may have made her functionally dependent on [defendants] does \nnot transform her voluntary tenancy at [a state run apartment] into an involuntary confinement”).  \nIdentical considerations govern in this case. \nMoreover, the facts that have been plead in the Complaint reveal that, far from being de \njure or de facto involuntary committed to NJDC or WDC, it is Plaintiffs sincere desire to remain \n14 \n \n\nat those facilities.  (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 96 (“All Plaintiffs are medically and developmentally \nmost appropriately served at the [NJDC or WDC] instead of any alternative setting.”).)  Indeed, \nthe relief sought by virtue of the due process claim – as well as all other claims in this case – is \nan order enjoining the State from moving the Plaintiffs out of NJDC or WDC without their \nconsent.  (See Compl. ¶ 176.)  It simply cannot be the case that a constitutional right that arises \nfrom the state’s act of confining an individual at a government facility against his will can be \nenforced to require the state to keep an individual at a government facility of his choosing.  \nPlaintiffs’ due process claim, to the extent that it is based on the living conditions of two state-\nrun facilities where Plaintiffs voluntarily receive state-provided services, fails as a matter of law \nand is therefore dismissed.7 \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendants’ motion [Docket Entry 4], and \ndismiss the Complaint with prejudice.  An appropriate Order will be filed herewith. \n \n                     s/ Stanley R. Chesler          \n               STANLEY R.

North Jersey opened in February 1928.  With its campus-like setting, it \nincludes approximately thirty-five (35) buildings, including living areas, sheltered workshops, \nvocational building, school building, chapel, healthcare center, auditorium, and recreational \nfacilities.  It is located in Totowa, Passaic County, New Jersey.  It is the northern most \nresidential developmental center in New Jersey.  NJDC is a public entity covered by Title II of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  It receives federal funds under       \n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n45.      The Defendant, WOODBRIDGE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER (“Woodbridge” \nor “WDC”), is a residential facility that provides, among other things, habilitation, behavioral, \nand medical services and supports for individuals with developmental and intellectual \n  14\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 15 of 56 PageID: 15\ndisabilities.   Woodbridge was established in 1965. With its campus-like setting, it includes \napproximately twenty-five (25) buildings, including residential cottages, therapy rooms, \nhealthcare services center, multi-purpose rooms, and recreational and entertainment facilities.  It \nis located in Woodbridge, Northern Middlesex County, New Jersey.  WDC is a public entity \ncovered by Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  It receives \nfederal funds under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n  46.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), the named Plaintiffs bring this action \non behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. \n  47.  The Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 USC § 12132; § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794 (“Section 504”), and the waiver of state sovereign immunity enacted in 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-\n7(a)( 1), various Medicaid federal statutes, and regulations incorporated into New Jersey law and \nthe United States Constitution, on behalf of a Class consisting of themselves and all other \npersons who are residents of the North Jersey Developmental Center and Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Center, Passaic and Northern Middlesex counties, respectively, New Jersey, as of \nAugust 1, 2012.    \n  48.  The proposed class consists of:  New Jersey residents who reside or resided at the \nNorth Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers, at anytime since August 1, 2012, or at any \ntime during this litigation.  \n  15\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 16 of 56 PageID: 16\n  49.  Joinder of the entire Class is impracticable because the Class Members are \nnumerous, and are persons with severe or profound developmental disabilities.  Virtually all \nClass Members are unable to give their consent except through guardians or family members. \n  50.  The Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims asserted on behalf of the Class. \n  51.  The Plaintiffs do not have any interests that are adverse or antagonistic to any \nclaims or potential claims of the Class. \n  52.  The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of \nthe Class. \n53.  The Plaintiffs are committed to the vigorous prosecution of this action and have \nretained counsel competent and experienced in this type of litigation. \n54.  The Plaintiffs do not seek monetary damages.  Hence, the burden and expense of \nprosecuting this litigation makes it unlikely that members of the Class would or could prosecute \nindividual actions.  If individual actions were pursued by Class Members, prosecution of those \nindividual claims would be impracticable and inefficient. \n55.  This Court is the most appropriate forum for adjudicating the claims at issue, \nwhich arise under federal law. \n56.  The Plaintiffs do not anticipate any difficulty in the management of this action as \na class action. \n57.  There are many questions of law and fact common to the Class, which \npredominate over any questions which may affect individual members.  The predominant \ncommon questions of law and fact include, among others: \n(a)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of the Civil Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983; \n  16\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 17 of 56 PageID: 17\n(b)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; \n(c)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”); \n(d)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of various Medicaid federal \nstatutes and regulations incorporated into New Jersey law; \n(e)  Whether Defendants are liable for violations of the United States \nConstitution; and \n(f)  Whether named Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to equitable and \ninjunctive relief. \n58.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. \n59.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and expenses as \npermitted by law, on behalf of themselves and the Class. \n \nCOMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS. \n60.  All of the Plaintiffs reside at the North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental \nCenters or resided there as of August 1, 2012. \n61.  Almost all of the Plaintiffs have lived in their homes at NJDC and WDC for many \nyears, with approximately 80 percent of those residents having lived there for more than 20 \nyears.  Many of these individuals have resided at the Developmental Centers for over 40 years. \n  17\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 18 of 56 PageID: 18\n62.  The North Jersey Developmental Center is an Intermediate Care Facility for \nIndividuals with Intellectual Disabilities (“ICF/IDD”) that is operated by the State of New \nJersey.   \n63.  The Woodbridge Developmental Center is an Intermediate Care Facility for \nIndividuals with Intellectual Disabilities (“ICF/IDD”) that is operated by the State of New \nJersey.   \n64.  An Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual  \nDisabilities(“ICF/IID”) (formerly referred to as an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally \nRetarded or “ICF/MR”) is regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(“CMS”) in conjunction with the State’s licensing agency.  Part of that regulatory process \nincludes routine surveys by CMS and the State’s licensing agency to ensure quality treatment \nand services are provided by ICF/IID-certified facilities, like North Jersey or Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Centers. \n65.  Eligibility for residence in a New Jersey developmental center is defined by \nSection 1.3 of Division Circular #3, N.J.A.C. 10:46-1.3, effective March 24, 2011.  That \nregulation defines the developmental disability that must be present in order to receive services \nas a severe, chronic disability of an individual, which is attributable to a mental impairment, \nphysical impairment, or combination of both; is manifested before age 22; is likely to continue \nindefinitely; results in a combination of functional limitations in major life activities; reflects the \nneed for a combination of special interdisciplinary care or treatment of lifelong or extended \nduration; and includes, but is not limited to, developmental disabilities, autism, cerebral palsy, \nepilepsy, spina bifida, and other neurological impairments. \n  18\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 19 of 56 PageID: 19\n66.  All of the Plaintiffs are diagnosed as in need of state-run ICF/IID institutional \ncare and have been appropriately designated as eligible for state-operated ICF/IID-level of care. \n67.  Many of the individuals residing at the North Jersey Developmental Center have \nbeen diagnosed with profound or severe intellectual disabilities. Almost all individuals residing \nat NJDC have been diagnosed with additional disabilities, including seizure disorders, autism, \ncerebral palsy, vision difficulties, and hearing impairments.  For example:  \n(a)  The Plaintiff, Jacqueline Friedman, is profoundly cognitively disabled.  She is \nnon-verbal and requires constant care.   \n(b)  The Plaintiff, Paul Dittamo, cannot walk, is non-verbal and experiences daily \nseizures.  His medical care requires constant communication between \nprofessionals.  \n(c) The Plaintiff, Stephen Dyer, is non-verbal and is diagnosed with \nmicrocephaly, spastic cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, bilateral contractures, \nbilateral chronic hip dislocation, delayed swallowing reflex, small hiatal \nhernia, osteoporosis, and esophogitis. \n(d)  The Plaintiff, Susan Griffin, is diagnosed with severe mental retardation, \nbipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and atrophy of the brain. She requires \nconstant care and medical coordination between professionals.          \n(e)  The Plaintiff, Eugene Kessler, is diagnosed with moderate retardation and \npervasive developmental disabilities, he suffers from autism, bipolar disorder, \nand lacks judgment. He often becomes agitated and prone to harm himself, or \nothers.   \n  19\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 20 of 56 PageID: 20\n(f)  The Plaintiff, Philip Conkling, is autistic and suffers from cognitive \ndisabilities.  Philip thrives on structure and routine.   \n(g) The Plaintiff, Ralph Grzymkowski, is diagnosed with autism.  He exhibits \nsevere behaviors and is very combative.  He requires constant supervision. \n(h) The Plaintiff, Mary Ellen Scesa, is diagnosed with severe mental retardation \nand Dyke-Davidoff Syndrome, she is non-ambulatory and non-verbal.  She \nsuffers from seizures as well.  She requires constant care.     \n (i)  The Plaintiff, Alice Tucker, is diagnosed with seizure disorder, schizophrenia, \ncerebral palsy, depression, malignant breast cancer, high blood pressure, and \ngout.  She is extremely combative and aggressive. She is bi-polar and \nexperiences multiple personalities. \n (j)   The Plaintiff, Stephanie Roots, suffers from seizures.  She had a tumor in her \npelvis and now requires a leg brace to ambulate. \n(k)  The Plaintiff, Andrew Sekela, is prone to elopement when a situation arises \nthat he perceives as unfair or when he becomes overwhelmed.  He has \nmultiple seizure disorder brought on by multiple brain scarring from \nmeningitis suffered at age two.  Andrew requires constant supervision. \n(l)  The Plaintiff, Kesha Smith, is epileptic and suffers from petit mal seizures.  \nShe has limited speech and is prone to wandering and aggressive behavior.  \nShe requires much supervision. \n(m) The Plaintiff, Paul Vacca, has cerebral palsy, he is non-verbal and walks with \na difficult gait.  He experiences frequent falls and engages in self-injurious \nbehavior, banging his head when frustrated. \n  20\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 21 of 56 PageID: 21\n(n)  The Plaintiff, Ralph Verleur, has cerebral palsy, is blind in one eye, is \nincontinent, and is not ambulatory.  He relies on staff for total care including \nblowing his nose.  He suffers from echolalia.  He takes constipation and anti-\nconvulsant medication. \n68.  Most (approximately 97%) of the individuals residing at the Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Center have been diagnosed with profound or severe intellectual disabilities. \nAlmost all individuals residing at WDC have been diagnosed with additional disabilities, \nincluding seizure disorders, autism, cerebral palsy, vision difficulties, and hearing impairments.  \nFor example: \n(a)  The Plaintiff, Rosemary Sciarrillo, suffers from severe scoliosis, dysphagia, \nsevere constipation, severe osteoporosis (with high fracture risk), and a \nseizure disorder.  She is unable to communicate and needs to be re-positioned \nevery couple hours.  Rosemary is totally dependent upon staff to initiate and \ncomplete all activities of daily living.     \n(b)  The Plaintiff, Joyce Banos, suffers from major depressive disorder, seizure \ndisorder, cerebral palsy, moderate dyshagia, constipation, thoracolumbar \nkyphoscoliosis, myopic astigmatism, osteopenia, chronic esophagitis, and \ngastritis.  Joyce is non-verbal.  Her routine medications include Citrical, \nVitamin D, Zantac, Lamictal, Colace, and Lexapro. \n(c) The Plaintiff, Robert Barrett, is non-verbal.  He is blind in one eye and has \nscoliosis.  He requires 1:1 supervision to prevent self-injury and wears a \nhelmet and face mask to protect himself from his own slaps and from falls. \n  21\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 22 of 56 PageID: 22\n(d) The Plaintiff, Charles David Christensen, is diagnosed with epilepsy and \nautism.  He requires constant care and 15 minute checks for safety and \nprotection.  \n(e) The Plaintiff, Arleen Brause, suffers from severe emotional and behavioral \nproblems.  She has many fears and phobias and is easily agitated.  She is \ndiagnosed with cerebral palsy and autism. \n(f) The Plaintiff, Kenneth Cooper, has cerebral palsy and is blind.   \n(g) The Plaintiff, Vincent Galluccio, is non-verbal, suffers from a major motor \nseizure disorder, and requires constant care. \n(h) The Plaintiff, Rodney Hammond, suffers from severe chronic cerebral palsy.  \nHe is non-verbal and cannot walk.  He requires constant care.   \n(i)  The Plaintiff, Sharon Knapp, has osteoporosis and is at risk of falls.  She has a \n1:1 aide. \n(j)  The Plaintiff, Richard Sarao, has cerebral palsy and is prone to self-abusive \nbehavior.  He requires constant care and supervision.        \n(k) The Plaintiff, Cheryl Gordon, experiences severe behavioral issues.  She \nsuffers from a brain injury acquired at birth. Cheryl requires constant \nsupervision.  \n(l)  The Plaintiff, Peter Canale, is blind and deaf, and has intellectual disabilities.  \nWeighing 60 pounds, he is very frail.  He is on a feeding tube and recognizes \npeople by smell and touch. He is diagnosed with hydrocephalus and spina \nbifida.   \n  22\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 23 of 56 PageID: 23\n(m)  The Plaintiff, Linda Graves, experiences seizures.  At times, she is seen by    \nphysicians on 15 minute interval checks.   \n(n) The Plaintiff, Dianne O’Brien, is diagnosed with profound retardation.  She is \nnon-ambulatory and non-verbal.  She has osteoporosis and experiences \nseizures.  She wears a nerve monitor around her vagal nerve.   \n(o)  The Plaintiff, Thomas Marinello, requires constant care and close supervision.  \nThomas has a curvature of the spine and cannot sit up on his own or stand.  He \ncannot talk and suffers from a palate defect.  \n(p)  The Plaintiff, Maureen Doran, is prone to wander and exhibits violent \nbehavior.  She experiences extreme anxiety.  She has pervasive developmental \ndisability.  \n(q)  The Plaintiff, Kerr Mitchell, is mentally and physically disabled.  He suffers \nfrom seizures and brain injury.

She often refuses to \neat.  She has a diagnosis of profound mental retardation.   \n(t)   The Plaintiff, Catherine O’Brien, is non-verbal and non-ambulatory.  She is \ndiagnosed with microcephaly and profound mental retardation. She suffers \nfrom seizures, regurgitation, chronic constipation, chronic otis media, and \nosteoporosis.  For safety, she requires 15 minute checks.  She also relies on \n  23\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 24 of 56 PageID: 24\ntotal care from staff (including being pushed in her wheelchair, hand over \nhand assistance for all activities, bathing, dressing, being hand fed, and \nrepositioning.) Her medications include Lamictal, Keppra, Phenobarbitol, \nColace, Milk of Magnesia, Senalcot, Fleet Enema, Ducolax, Reglan, Zantac, \nActonel, Oscal D, Tylenol and Unicap.  Catherine routinely sees an \nothalmologist, gynecologist, GI consultant, ENT audiologist, dentist, \npodiatrist, and neurologist. \n69.  The primary service needs of individuals at North Jersey or Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Centers require a variety of services and supports. Some broad areas of service \nare described below, along with the number of individuals for whom that service is their primary \nneed: \n(a)  Extensive Personal Care - This need refers to people who require total \nassistance and care provided by direct service staff who are specially trained \non individualized programs developed by residents’ treating professionals, \nincluding physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, \nspeech language pathologists, and many other licensed clinicians who treat \nresidents at the Centers. \n(b)  Significant Health Care Services - Treating professionals at NJDC and WDC  \nhave determined that significant nursing intervention and monitoring are \nrequired to effectively treat residents who have significant health care needs.  \nThis service includes the need for 24-hour monitoring and immediate \navailability of treating professionals for intermittent pressure breathing, \n  24\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 25 of 56 PageID: 25\ninhalation assistive devices, tracheotomy care, or treatment for recurrent \npneumonias or apnea. \n(c) Ambulation – Many residents at NJDC and WDC are non-ambulatory or \nrequire assistance with ambulation. \n(d) Significant Behavioral Support – Many residents at NJDC and WDC require \nsignificant behavioral support. This need addresses individuals who have \nbehaviors that require intervention for the safety of themselves or others, as \ndeveloped by psychologists and medical personnel and implemented in \nconjunction with direct service staff. \n70.  Prior to 2012, all NJDC and WDC residents were consistently evaluated by their \ntreating professionals and determined to be in need of ICF/IID services, and the best setting for \nPlaintiffs to receive those services was at NJDC or WDC as determined by the professional \njudgment of these professionals.  Subsequent to Defendants’ announcement of its intent to close \nthe NJDC and WDC, treating professionals often have routinely and inappropriately stated that \nPlaintiffs would best be served in alternative settings, including settings that do not provide \nICF/IID-level of care.  Most of these statements supporting placement in the “community” were \nnot based upon sound and unbiased professional judgments consistent with accepted professional \nstandards. \n71.  While many residents’ IHP teams have agreed that the residents’ needs were \nbetter served at their current ICF/IID, social workers have more recently been sending letters, \nscheduling IHP meetings promoting community placements.  Such letters are DDD-generated, \nbureaucratic, form letters.  For example, the 1/14/13 letter to Eleanor Gordon, scheduling her \ndaughter’s, Cheryl’s, IHP meeting uses the name “Dawn” instead of Cheryl, throughout.  While \n  25\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 26 of 56 PageID: 26\nDaniel Christensen’s 2/13/13 letter used the correct residents’ name, David, it stated the same \nexact non-subtle push for community placements. \n72.  Community placements are being sought for residents regardless of their needs.  \nFor example, a State caseworker considered community placement to be inappropriate for \nEugene Kessler, yet, nonetheless is pursuing an alternative community placement, an apartment, \nfor him. \n73.  Plaintiffs have the right to receive ICF/IID-level of services from the State of \nNew Jersey. \n74.  All Plaintiffs have had or imminently will have their rights to receive ICF/IID-\nlevel services at the North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers denied.  The policies \nand practices of the State will deceive, frighten, and coerce residents of  NJDC and WDC into \ninappropriately surrendering their rights to receive this superior level of care. \n(a)  The Plaintiff, Diane O’Brien, has not had an appropriate assessment by her \ninterdisciplinary team for a lesser restrictive residential environment, yet, her \nplan describes her as being appropriate for community placement.  Her father \nand legal guardian opposes a community placement for Diane at this time due \nto her health issues.  She experiences seizures; wears a heart monitor and \napplies a magnet; and wears a nerve monitor.     \n(b)  The Plaintiff, Thomas Marinello, has resided at WDC since childhood and is \nhappy and thriving.  His mother and sister, his legal guardians, feel pressured \nand manipulated by the State to move Thomas into a community setting, \nbeing told that if they did not move him the State would be forced to place \n  26\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 27 of 56 PageID: 27\nhim in a location further away.  Incomplete information has been provided to \nthem regarding any possible discharge.   \n(c) The sisters and legal guardians of Plaintiff, Maureen Doran, were advised by \nthe State that if they did not make an immediate decision regarding alternative \ncommunity placement for Maureen, the State would make the decision for \nthem.  Maureen was not offered an alternative developmental center. \n(d) The brother and guardian of the Plaintiff, Joyce Banos, was lectured at every \nIHP meeting about considering community placement.  Mr. Banos’ wishes \nthat his sister remain in ICF/IID care were not respected until he wrote a letter \nexpressing his opposition to community placement for Joyce and explaining \nher need to stay at WDC.  Mr. Banos sits with a team of 15 professionals at \nJoyce’s yearly IHP meeting; these specific skilled professionals are required \nto keep Joyce alive and healthy.  \n(e)  A guardian and mother, Dana Grzymkowski, receives frequent telephone calls \nfrom state employees pressuring her and her husband to choose a community \nplacement for her son, Ralph. \n(f)  Although Plaintiff, Vincent Galluccio, is non-verbal, his plan indicates that he \nwould like to move to a community placement, despite his guardian’s wishes. \nStaff have been non-specific about the availability of required supports for \nVincent in the community. \n  75.  Many NJDC and WDC residents have lived in the community at some time.  Such \nplacements have proven to be unsuccessful. \n  27\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 28 of 56 PageID: 28\n(a)  The Plaintiff, Arleen Brause, spent several months in a group home.  She was \nlonely, insecure, and constantly upset.  No activities or on-site medical care \nwere available to her. \n(b)  The Plaintiff, Cheryl Gordon, tried placements at various group homes.  She \nwas asked to leave the homes due to her behavioral issues, which the homes \nwere not equipped to manage. \n(c)  The Plaintiff, Philip Conkling, experienced a group home, but the lack of \nsupervision for his wandering necessitated return to a facility which could \nbetter serve his health and welfare. \n(d)  The Plaintiff, Clayton Davis, tried an alternative community placement three \nyears ago.  The placement could not adequately address his emotional and \npsychological needs.  He was needlessly medicated at the home in their effort \nto care for him. \n(e)  The Plaintiff, Susan Griffin, experienced a group home which her guardian \ndescribed as “total chaos.”  Susan was released to a psychiatric hospital and, \nonce stabilized, moved to NJDC where she has been thriving. \n(f)  The Plaintiff, Kesha Smith, tried a group home but was asked to leave the \nhome due to her aggression.  While she was at the home she would get on the \nbus and ride around the city for as long as the drivers would allow. \n(g)  The Plaintiff, Alice Tucker, has experienced group homes where she was \nphysically abused and underfed.  In group home proposals, it has been \nsuggested that staff call 911 to manage Alice’s aggressive episodes. \n  28\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 29 of 56 PageID: 29\n76.  There has been, and there is a continuing further risk of, a loss of professionals \nand other staff at North Jersey and Woodbridge Developmental Centers due to a perceived lack \nof job security.  Such losses have and will result in larger caseloads for existing staff, and thus \nless time and care for each resident.  For example at WDC, Cottage 1 Social Worker, (Doris \nDodkowitz), retired and was replaced by a Social Worker, (Norma Bonilla), who is now \nresponsible for 3 cottages instead of two.  Also, the Habilitation Coordinator, Kim Shackleton \ntransferred from WDC in April 2013, and her vacant position has not yet been filled. \n77.  There has been, and there continues to be a further risk of, a loss of some services \nat North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers due to downsizing and eventual closure.  \nThis has and will result in inferior care in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights and will ultimately \ninappropriately force residents to leave North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers.  \nFor example, there has already been a decrease in the availability of certain medications, \nsupplies, and skin care products. \n78.  As NJDC cottages close, in some building units, such as at resident Andrew \nSekela’s unit, inexperienced and over-worked staff have replaced experienced staff, resulting in \nconfusion with respect to resident care. \n79.   As NJDC cottages close, resident housing is being merged, creating a dangerous \nand chaotic environment.  Andrew Sekela’s mother has been physically harmed by another \nresident when visiting Andrew and is aware of various resident-to-resident and resident-to-staff \nassaults due to the revised living arrangements. \n80.  The Defendants have acted, or failed to properly act, under the color of state law, \npursuant to the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates. \n  29\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 30 of 56 PageID: 30\n81.  The Defendants have determined that the residents of WDC and NJDC have \ndevelopmental disabilities and require treatment, services, supports, and care.   \n82.  The Defendants have, since the decision to close the developmental centers, \nincreasingly failed to provide the WDC and NJDC residents with reasonably safe conditions in \ntheir delivery of treatment, service, supports, and care.  \n83.  One example of recent inadequate staffing and lack of protection from harm \noccurred to Maureen Doran.  Maureen was sleeping when a resident came upon her and started \nbeating her with a metal chair.  The supervisor was at the other end of the cottage.  The beating \nwent on for some significant time because they were unattended. There was inadequate direct \ncare staff.  The next morning, her guardian was notified that Maureen was taken to the hospital \nas a precautionary measure due to a nosebleed. The guardian did not find out that there was an \nattack until much later.  Previous to this attack, there were two separate incidents where Maureen \nsuffered a fractured foot and a head injury with a bleed due to poor staffing.  However, Maureen \nremained inadequately supervised at the time of the attack. \n \n84.  The Defendants’ treatment, services, supports, and care, since the decision to \nclose the developmental centers, have in some instances substantially departed from generally \naccepted professional standards of care.   \n85.  The Defendants’ provision of psychological and behavioral services, since the \ndecision to close the developmental centers, have in some instances substantially departed from \ngenerally accepted professional standards. \n86.  The Defendants’ provision of medical, neurological, and nursing services, since \nthe decision to close the developmental centers, have in some instances substantially departed \nfrom generally accepted professional standards. \n  30\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 31 of 56 PageID: 31\n87.  The Defendants’ provision of psychiatric services, since the decision to close the \ndevelopmental centers, have in some instances substantially departed from generally accepted \nprofessional standards. \n88.  The Defendants’ provision of habilitation and therapy services, including physical \nand nutritional management, since the decision to close the developmental centers, has in some \ninstances substantially departed from generally accepted professional standards. \n89.  The Defendants’ provision of protection from harm mechanisms, since the \ndecision to close the developmental centers, has in soome instances substantially departed from \ngenerally accepted professional standards. \n90.  Due to some instances of lack of appropriate treatment, services, supports, and \ncare, since the decision to close the developmental centers, the residents are at significant risk of \nharm, or have suffered actual harm.   \n91.  The Defendants have failed in some instances to provide the WDC and NJDC \nresidents, since the decision to close the developmental centers, with the appropriate level of \nhabilitation training and behavioral training required to protect the residents’ liberty interests to \nprotect them from harm and the freedom of undue restraints. \n92.  The Defendants seek to compel Plaintiffs’ discharge from North Jersey or \nWoodbridge Developmental Centers to other settings, including predominately non-ICF/IID-\ncertified settings.   \n93.  The Defendants’ policies and procedures have interfered with or usurped the \nability of Plaintiffs’ treating professionals to make independent and sound professional \njudgments.  The treating professionals are now often following a political or administrative \nagenda rather than accepted professional standards. \n  31\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 32 of 56 PageID: 32\n94.  The Defendants’ policies and procedures have unduly influenced or compelled \nPlaintiffs’ treating professionals to recommend transfer or discharge of Plaintiffs to settings that \nare not the most appropriate for Plaintiffs’ needs, solely for the purpose of conforming to \nDefendants’ political policy decisions. \n95.  In some cases, staff exaggerates the residents’ personal care abilities in order to \ndocument the appropriateness of a community placement.  For example: \n(a)  Staff  report that resident Paul Dittamo is able to feed himself.  However, staff \nmust place food on a spoon for Paul and assist him in bringing it to his mouth; \nand only a portion of the food makes it into his mouth.  If Paul were left to \nfeed himself, he would be underfed. \n(b)  Staff  report that resident Peter Canale is able to brush his teeth.  However, \nstaff put the toothbrush in his hand and assist him in performing this function.  \nHe is unable to brush his teeth on his own. \n(c)  Staff uses language in the first person in residents’ IHPs, creating a false \nperception of resident choice and a false impression that residents are less \nintellectually disabled.   \n96.  All Plaintiffs are medically and developmentally most appropriately served at the \nNorth Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers instead of any alternative setting. \n97.  All Plaintiffs are physically, mentally, and emotionally fragile and are most \nappropriately served at the North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers instead of any \nalternative setting. \n  32\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 33 of 56 PageID: 33\n98.  All Plaintiffs are in need of continuous care by multidisciplinary teams of \nprofessionals as are currently serving them at the North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental \nCenters. \n99.  The services provided to Plaintiffs cannot be reasonably replicated in alternative \nresidential settings. \n100.  Non-ICF/IID-certified settings are not able to reasonably provide the same level \nof care as an ICF/IID-certified facility. \n101.  Services provided to residents at the North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental \nCenters are uniquely tailored to the needs of the residents of those Centers. \n102.  None of the Plaintiffs have given informed consent for their discharge from North \nJersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers because, among other things, Defendants have \nprecluded treating professionals at the North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers from \nfully and fairly considering whether North Jersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers best \nmeet the needs of the Plaintiffs, and have prevented those treating professionals from \nacknowledging the rights of Plaintiffs to receive treatment and services at North Jersey or \nWoodbridge Developmental Centers, or in another ICF/IID. \n103.  Alternative ICFs/IID, if available, are many miles away, and deny guardians, \nparents, and family members the opportunity to visit on a regular basis.  Many guardians, \nparents, and family members are elderly and cannot make a long distance trip to visit a distant \nICF/IID.  Such lack of family bonding may cause further harm to the well-being of those being \nmoved and disrupts the family ties.   Family members and guardians contribute positively to the \ncare, treatment, habilitation, and psychological well-being of residents, and residents will suffer \ngreat harm if their loved ones cannot participate. \n  33\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 34 of 56 PageID: 34\n104.  Plaintiffs have not had the benefit of their respective treating professionals’ \nindependent judgments about whether they should continue to reside at North Jersey or \nWoodbridge Developmental Centers or at another state-operated ICF/IID. \n105.  Defendants have or will unduly influence or compel Plaintiffs to receive services \nin non-ICF/IID facilities.  Those services are inferior to the services provided at North Jersey or \nWoodbridge Developmental Centers because, among other reasons, they will not be provided by \nan individualized, multidisciplinary team of professionals. \n106.  Some Plaintiffs will be unable to even receive services in the community.  For \nexample, Ralph Verleur has been rejected for admissions to three group homes.  One home \nwould not take him because it was too small for him to maneuver his wheelchair.  Another group \nhome declared him an inappropriate candidate due to his echolalia. \n107.  Persons residing in the type of settings to which Defendants intend to discharge \nPlaintiffs, are at approximately seventy-five (75) percent greater risk of death, abuse, and neglect \nas compared to similar persons receiving services at a facility like North Jersey or Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Centers. \n108.  Defendants know or should know of the increased danger of death, abuse, and \nneglect to which Plaintiffs will be subjected if they are discharged from the North Jersey or \nWoodbridge Developmental Centers, as sought by Defendants’ political plan to downsize or \nclose all the Developmental Centers. \n109.  Persons residing in the type of “community” settings to which Defendants intend \nto discharge Plaintiffs are likely to be more secluded from the community immediately \nsurrounding them and be more restricted in their interactions with non-disabled peers as \n  34\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 35 of 56 PageID: 35\ncompared to similar persons receiving services at a facility like North Jersey or Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Centers. \n110.  Defendants have announced their plan to “depopulate” and close NJDC and WDC \nand discharge residents to non-ICF-IID-certified alternative settings.  The plan is to move the \nresidents to “community” settings such as small group homes, nursing homes, and other settings \nwith smaller populations where they would allegedly have more interactions with the non-\ndisabled population.  In reality, these residents may actually be more isolated in a small home or \napartment than they were at NJDC and WDC, as both centers are open to community events and \nhave opportunities for community involvement.  \n111.  Among the reasons identified by Defendants for their “depopulation” plan was the \nostensibly high cost of providing the necessary services for the disabled residents of the State’s \ndevelopmental centers.  In reality, the costs for caring for these residents in community settings \nwould be equal to or higher than care in the developmental centers. \n112.  Contrary to Defendants’ public statements about the alleged general desire for \n“community” placements, Plaintiffs have not requested discharge or transition from North Jersey \nor Woodbridge Developmental Centers.  \n113.  Defendants have instructed or inappropriately encouraged Plaintiffs’ treating \nprofessionals to include language in Plaintiffs’ individual habilitation plans indicating that \nPlaintiffs are capable of being served in settings other than North Jersey or Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Centers regardless of whether Plaintiffs are actually capable of being served in \nalternative settings. \n114.  Defendants have instructed or inappropriately encouraged Plaintiffs’ treating \nprofessionals to include language in Plaintiffs’ individual habilitation plans indicating that \n  35\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 36 of 56 PageID: 36\nPlaintiffs have requested discharge to settings other than North Jersey or Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Centers regardless of whether Plaintiffs actually communicated such a request. \n115.  These treating professionals are likely intimidated and fearful of retaliation, \nincluding the possible loss of their jobs, and likely will only be forthcoming with information to \nsupport the position of Plaintiffs if protected by or compelled by appropriate discovery in this \ncase. \n116.  Because Plaintiffs’ treating professionals have not been able to provide \nindependent judgments about the Plaintiffs’ ability to be comparatively served in alternative \nsettings, the judgments they have made in that regard are largely unreliable and inaccurate. \n117.  Many of the Plaintiffs have not been provided sufficient information to allow \nthem to provide informed consent to discharge. \n118.  Plaintiffs’ guardians and family members have been given unclear and conflicting \ninformation as to the availability of specific alternative placements. In some cases, since \ninformation has not been forthcoming by the State, parents are left to believe speculation of \noptions from other parents. \n(a)  The guardians/family members of Maureen Doran and Eugene Carr, for \nexample, felt pressured as they were told by their caseworkers that the longer \nthey wait to choose a placement, the less choice they will have and that if they \ndid not make a choice, the state would make it for them..  No specific \nalternative placements to “choose” from were offered. \n(b) Some residents’ family members, such as Kerr Mitchell’s mother, were falsely  \ntold that if a parent refuses a staff’s choice of placement or declined \nplacement, their loved one would be sent home. \n  36\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 37 of 56 PageID: 37\n(c) The guardians of Ralph Grzymkowski continuously receive unwelcome \ncorrespondence from different agencies, the purpose of which is to move \nRalph to a community setting.  The guardians believe that the NJDC \nplacement is a much better fit for their son.   \n(d) Residents have only been given two insufficient choices: a non-specific \ncommunity placement or an alternative developmental center over one \nhundred miles away. \n(e) Information provided to guardians and family members by the State has been \none-sided, promoting the only the alleged benefits of community placement.  \nThe State has not made sufficient effort to address the potential risks of \ncommunity placement and has not sufficiently attempted to lessen \nguardians’/family members’ fears and concerns. \n(f) In some cases, such as that of Plaintiff Andrew Sekela, NJDC personnel \ndiscussed his transfer to a group home with Andrew without the consent or \nparticipation of his guardian.  NJDC allowed group home providers to \ninterview Andrew without the notification, participation or consent of \nAndrew’s guardian or members of his NJDC staff.  Talk of the move upset \nhim.  He understood the move as imminent release and has acted out by \neloping.   \n(g) The Plaintiff, Stephen Dyer, requires extensive medical and therapeutic care \nto prevent further regression.  He requires round-the-clock nursing care for his \nmedical needs.  Yet, the State inappropriately considers him an “adequate \ncandidate” for a, non-specific, community placement.  His guardians and \n  37\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 38 of 56 PageID: 38\nparents feel pressured by the State to consider community placement and they \nare often solicited from various inadequate group homes. \n119.       Defendants made the decision to downsize or depopulate the North Jersey or \nWoodbridge Developmental Centers without regard to the needs of the individual Plaintiffs, their \nindividual support plans (which are developed in conjunction with their treating professionals), \nor their rights to receive services in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs. \n120.  On December 14, 2011, the New Jersey Legislature enacted a statute which \nincluded the creation of a task force to evaluate the state’s seven developmental centers and to \nissue binding and non-binding recommendations to the Department of Human Services (“DHS”) \nwith respect to closure of one or more of the centers.  Senate No. 2928, Chapter 143 P.L. 2011.   \n121.  On August 1, 2012, the “Task Force on the Closure of State Developmental \nCenters” (“task force”) issued a “Final Report As Submitted to Governor Chris Christie and the \nNew Jersey Legislature” (“Final Report). \n122.  The Task Force’s allegedly binding recommendation as contained in the Final \nReport instructed DHS “to develop and implement a plan to close North Jersey Developmental \nCenter followed by Woodbridge Developmental Center within the next five years ….”  Id. at 8.  \n123.  While the Final Report contains language allegedly regarding the needs of the \nresidents, such language is largely rendered meaningless by the Task Force’s presumption that \nthe two facilities must be closed, and that residents must be discharged to achieve its binding \nrecommendation and to achieve the political agenda of the State.   \n124.  The Task Force’s recommendations and the State’s actions to discharge residents \nto comply with the recommendations of closure prevent meaningful evaluation and consideration \n  38\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 39 of 56 PageID: 39\nof treatment team professionals regarding most integrated residential settings and alternative \nsettings which can serve the needs of such residents.   \n125.  The Task Force’s decision to close NJDC and WDC was largely predetermined \nbefore conducting any investigations or making any findings.  \n126.  In rendering it’s opinions and recommendations, the Task Force ignored \ntestimony and information regarding the large percentages of those at NJDC and WDC who are \nopposed to community placement; the level of impairment of the NJDC and WDC residents \n(compared to those in other developmental centers); and the availability of appropriate and \nadequate alternative placements to match the current level of services provided to NJDC and \nWDC residents.       \n127.  The Task Force rendered opinions and recommendations based on faulty data, \nincluding inaccurate unemployment data in the various New Jersey regions; inaccurate projected \nrepair and maintenance costs of NJDC and WDC; and the lack of feasibility of a workable plan \nto meet the needs of all affected individuals within a five year timeframe.   \n128.  Residents of the State’s developmental centers, those recommended for closure \nand those not recommended for closure, have the right to receive recommendations from their \nrespective treating professionals regarding the most appropriate setting to meet the needs of such \nresidents. \n129.  The Task Force’s mandate to close two developmental centers without \nmeaningful evaluation of the residents’ needs further evidences that the residents of the \ndevelopmental centers have not received treating professionals’ recommendations without \nunreasonable interference or influence from the State’s policies, procedures and agendas. \n  39\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 40 of 56 PageID: 40\n  130.  Plaintiffs currently residing at North Jersey and Woodbridge Developmental \nCenters have been and will be denied access to their current high level of treatment and services \nif the Defendants continue with their current plan to discharge residents. \n \nCOMMON ALLEGATIONS OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES \n131.  As described more fully herein, each Plaintiff has a constitutional right, a life and \nliberty interest in, and a statutory entitlement to receive treatment and services from the State of \nNew Jersey in the most appropriate setting for his or her needs. \n132.  Interpreting the ADA and the Department of Justice’s regulations issued under it, \nthe Supreme Court decision in Olmstead emphasized that there is no “federal requirement that \ncommunity-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.” Olmstead v. Zimring, \net al., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999).  The Olmstead Court further stressed that “nothing in the ADA \nor its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable \nto handle or benefit from community settings.” Id. at 601-02. “[T]he ADA is not reasonably read \nto impel States to phase out institutions, placing patients in need of close care at risk.” Id. at 605. \n133.   In fact, the Olmstead decision recognized that “for [some] individuals, no \nplacement outside the institution may ever be appropriate.” Id. (citing and quoting Brief for \nAmerican Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae at 22-23 (“Some individuals, whether \nmentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times—perhaps in the short run, \nperhaps in the long run—for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of \ncommunity settings”); Brief for Voice of the Retarded et al. as Amici Curiae at 11 (“Each \ndisabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that person—\nrecognizing that, on a case-by-case basis, that setting may be in an institution”); Youngberg v. \n  40\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 41 of 56 PageID: 41\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 327 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (“For many mentally retarded \npeople, the difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution and \ntotal dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will \nknow”).) \n134.  By virtue of the ADA and the Olmstead decision, Plaintiffs have a federally-\nprotected right to receive recommendations from treating professionals as to whether community \nplacement is the most appropriate to meet their needs and to fair consideration of their opposition \nto that transfer, even if the proposed transfer is from institutional care to an allegedly less \nrestrictive setting.  The only proper mechanism for second-guessing an individual or guardian’s \ndecision to oppose a treating professional’s recommended transfer to a less restrictive setting is \nthrough State law and State Court Rules. See N.J. Stat. Ann. §§ 3B:12-1 et seq.; N.J. Court Rule \n4:86. \n135.  The paradigm created by the Olmstead decision dictates that residents of the \nNorth Jersey and Woodbridge Developmental Centers and their guardians have the benefit of \ntreating professionals’ judgments regarding the most appropriate place to receive services.  Only \nafter they have the benefit of that information are residents and guardians required to oppose or \nconsent to continued residence at the facility or discharge to an alternative setting. \n136.  The Defendants have ignored and will continue to ignore Plaintiffs’ right to have \ntreating professionals render full and fair judgments as to where Plaintiffs’ should receive \nservices most appropriate to their needs.   \n137.  Likewise, Defendants have ignored and will continue to ignore Plaintiffs’ rights, \nas recognized by Olmstead, to oppose discharge from NJDC and WDC. \n  41\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 42 of 56 PageID: 42\n138.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12134, Defendants are under a constitutional and \nstatutory duty to: \n(a)  effectuate the placement of Plaintiffs in the “most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities,” a setting \nthat “enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons \nto the fullest extent possible” (28 C.F.R. pt. 35 app. A.); \n(b)  not place Plaintiffs in more restrictive or dangerous placements than they \ncurrently enjoy; \n(c)  effectuate appropriate institutional placement for each Plaintiff; \n(d)  propose an ICF/IID-certified institutional discharge appropriate for the \nPlaintiffs only where medically and therapeutically appropriate upon an \nimpartial multidisciplinary evaluation; \n(e)  ensure that Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ guardians and/or Plaintiffs’ families \nunderstand their right to receive treatment and care at an ICF/IID-certified \nfacility prior to seeking consent to discharge a Plaintiff from the Center; \n(f)  obtain the input and informed consent of Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ guardians \nand/or Plaintiffs’ families for such transfers. \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  \n \nAMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT VIOLATIONS \n \n139.  Plaintiffs’ incorporate paragraphs one (1) through one hundred thirty-eight (138) \nherein by reference as though fully set forth. \n  42\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 43 of 56 PageID: 43\n140.  Because discharges or transfers are being forced on Plaintiffs without their \nconsent, or the consent of their guardians or families, and without appropriate recommendations \nfrom treating professionals, such discharges or transfers violate the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 – 12134. \n141.  The Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief that the Defendants \nshall not discharge or transfer them from their current residences without meeting the \nrequirements that: \n(a)  such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment and \nservices in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nresidence; \n(b)  such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating professionals \nunless the treating professionals independently conclude that such a placement \nis in the best interests of each Plaintiff and is the most appropriate setting to \nmeet their needs; and \n(c)  the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to consent to such discharge \nor transfer. \n142.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a)  directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared by \nPlaintiffs’ respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants’ political plan to downsize or close any developmental centers, \nand documented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIndividual Habilitation Plans, IHPs, at NJDC and WDC).   \n(b)  Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n  43\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 44 of 56 PageID: 44\n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary evaluation; \nand \n(ii)  to receive treatment in accordance with the independent recommendations \nof the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at his/her current residence, \nanother state operated ICF/IID facility, or non-ICF/IID certified setting, as \nthe Plaintiff deems appropriate. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nREHABILITATION ACT VIOLATIONS \n \n143.  Plaintiffs’ incorporate paragraphs one (1) through one hundred fourty-two (142) \nherein by reference as though fully set forth. \n144.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that “[n]o otherwise qualified person \nwith disabilities shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nfederal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \n145.  Each named Plaintiff and class member is a “qualified person with disabilities” \nwithin the meaning of Section 504, because they (1) have physical and/or mental impairments \nthat substantially limit one or more major life activities; and (2) meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for long term care under New Jersey’s Medicaid program and are thus “qualified.” \n146.  Regulations implementing Section 504 require that a public entity administer its \nservices, programs and activities in “the most integrated setting appropriate” to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities. 28 CFR § 41.51(d). \n147.  Section 504’s regulations prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from \nutilizing criteria or methods of administration: \n  44\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 45 of 56 PageID: 45\n(a)  that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to \ndiscrimination on the basis of handicap [or]  \n(b)  that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing \naccomplishment of the objectives of the recipient’s program with respect to \nhandicapped persons.  \n148.  Defendants have required that Plaintiffs be discharged or transferred from North \nJersey or Woodbridge Developmental Centers to other settings in violation of Section 504's \nintegration mandate.  \n149.  Further, Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration that \nsubject Plaintiffs and class members to discrimination on the basis of disability, by (1) failing to \nassess properly the services and supports that would enable Plaintiffs to receive services and \ntreatment in the most appropriate settings for their needs, (2) failing to develop proper \nindividualized transition plans, (3) failing to allow guardians to be a meaningful part of the \nplanning process, (4) failing to inform Plaintiffs of all of their options for receiving services, and \n(5) allocating resources for non-ICF/IID care contrary to the desires and needs of people with \ndisabilities.  \n150.  The Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief that the Defendants \nshall not discharge or transfer them from their current residences without meeting the \nrequirements that: \n (a) such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment and \nservices in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n  45\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 46 of 56 PageID: 46\n(b) such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating professionals \nunless the treating professionals conclude that such a placement is in the best \ninterests of the individual Plaintiffs and is most appropriate to meet their \nneeds; and \n(c) the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to consent to such discharge \nor transfer. \n151.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n \n(a) directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared by \nPlaintiffs’ respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants’ political plan to downsize or close any Developmental Centers, \nand documented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIHPs at NJDC and WDC).  \n(b)  permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n \n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary evaluation; \nand \n(ii) to receive treatment in accordance with the independent recommendations \nof the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at his/her current residence, \nanother state-operated ICF/IID facility, or non-ICF/IID certified setting, as \nthe Plaintiff deems appropriate. \n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nMEDICAID ACT AND REGULATORY VIOLATIONS \n \n  46\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 47 of 56 PageID: 47\n152.  Plaintiffs’ incorporate paragraphs one (1) through one hundred fifty-one (151) \nherein by reference as though fully set forth. \n153.  The State of New Jersey has voluntarily assumed certain obligations under federal \nlaw in return for federal funding under the Medical Assistance Program authorized by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396, et seq. \n154. Those  obligations include: \n(a)  choice of an ICF/IID institutional placement, subject to a hearing, under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396n and 42 CFR § 441.302(d); \n(b)  provision of ICF/IID services under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10) and \n1396d(a)(l5); \n(c)  competent evaluation for placement in an institutional ICF/IID facility under \n42 CFR § 483.440(b)(3); \n(d)  a continuous active treatment program as defined in 42 CFR § 483.440(a)(1). \n155.  All Plaintiffs receive assistance under the Medical Assistance Program and are \nowed the duties stated in the preceding paragraph. \n156.  Defendants have an obligation to ensure that Plaintiffs’ needs and preferences are \nbeing met in their multidisciplinary plan. \n157.  Defendants have failed to ensure that Plaintiffs’ needs and preferences are being \nmet in their multidisciplinary plan. \n158.  Defendants are violating their duties to Plaintiffs under the Medical Assistance \nProgram by their acts and omissions alleged above. \n159.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief as to the following: \n  47\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 48 of 56 PageID: 48\n(a)  such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment and \nservices in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n(b)  such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating professionals \nunless the treating professionals conclude that such a placement is in the best \ninterests of the individual Plaintiffs and most appropriate to meet their needs;  \n(c)  the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge or \ntransfer; and \n(d) the State must comply at the developmental centers with all the regulatory \nstandards contained in Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. \n(e) the services and care provided by the State at the developmental centers must \nmeet or exceed accepted professional standards, and must be maintained at a \nlevel at least equal to the care and services that preceded the decision to close \nthe developmental centers; and \n(f) the State must maintain staffing levels for direct care staff and treating \nprofessionals at a level that meets or exceeds accepted professional standards, \nand at a level at least equal to the staffing that preceded the decision to close \nthe developmental centers; \n(g) the State cannot move residents to other ICF’s/IID where their needs cannot \nbe adequately met, including, but not limited to, the State cannot move \nresidents to an ICF/IID that is so significantly distant from their families and \nguardians that any individual resident will be harmed in his care, treatment, \nhabilitation, or psychological well-being. \n  48\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 49 of 56 PageID: 49\n(h) the services and care provided by the State at the developmental centers must \nmeet or exceed accepted professional standards, and must be maintained at a \nlevel at least equal to the care and services that preceded the decision to close \nthe developmental centers; and \n(i) the State must maintain staffing levels for direct care staff and treating \nprofessionals at a level that meets or exceeds accepted professional standards, \nand at a level at least equal to the staffing that preceded the decision to close \nthe developmental centers; \n(j) the State cannot move residents to other ICF’s/IID where their needs cannot be \nadequately met, including, but not limited to, the State cannot move residents \nto an ICF/IID that is so significantly distant from their families and guardians \nthat any individual resident will be harmed in his care, treatment, habilitation, \nor psychological well-being. \n160.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a)  directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared by \nPlaintiffs’ respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants’ mandate to downsize or close any developmental centers, and \ndocumented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as IHPs \nat the NJDC and WDC).   \n(b)  permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary evaluation; \nand \n  49\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 50 of 56 PageID: 50\n(ii)  to receive treatment in accordance with the independent recommendations \nof the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at his/her current residence, \nanother state operated ICF/IID, or non-ICF/IID certified setting, as the \nPlaintiff deems appropriate. \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nCONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS \n \n161.  Plaintiffs’ incorporate paragraphs one (1) through one hundred sixty (160) herein \nby reference as though fully set forth. \n162.  At all relevant times, Defendants were “persons” under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n163.  At all relevant times, Defendants were acting “under color of state law” under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \n164.  At all relevant times, a “special relationship” existed between each of the \nPlaintiffs and the State and state actors that were responsible for their safety.  \n165.  The Defendants have demonstrated a pattern or practice of egregious and flagrant \nacts or omissions which violate federal rights of the WDC and NJDC residents, rights which are \nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.      \n166.  The Plaintiff residents will suffer irreparable harm if they are deprived the rights, \nprivileges and immunities provided by the Fourteenth Amendment and federal law.   \n167.  Defendants, while acting under color of state law, unlawfully, intentionally, \nunreasonably, maliciously and with deliberate and/or reckless indifference to the Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process rights secured to Plaintiffs under the Fourth and/or Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 et. seq. and \n  50\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 51 of 56 PageID: 51\nsimilar provisions of federal, state and/or local law, violated Plaintiffs’ rights as alleged above \nand as follows. \n168.  The Plaintiffs have significant mental, intellectual, physical and behavioral health \nissues.  They are unable to verbally articulate their medical and personal needs.  Most of them \nhave very limited mobility, and some have none.  They are unable to care for themselves in even \nthe most basic ways.  They are at the mercy of the persons who provide them with care.  Without \nthe regulatory guarantees provided by an ICF/IID facility, they are defenseless against many \nforms of abuse and neglect which can lead to their injury or death. \n169.  Before becoming residents at NJDC or WDC, some Plaintiffs were abused and \nneglected in the same types of “community” settings Defendants intend to force Plaintiffs into \nnow. \n170.  Defendants know or should know that placing the Plaintiffs in other settings, \nincluding non-ICF/IID settings will substantially increase their likelihood of injury and death \nfrom abuse, neglect, error, lack of appropriate services, and other causes. \n171.  Defendants’ failure to provide adequate safeguards to prevent such harm is a \nviolation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional right not to be deprived of life or liberty without due \nprocess of law. \n172.  Defendants’ discharge process and procedure, instituted in the efforts to close \nNJDC and WDC, has resulted in harm to the residents.  Loss of services, loss of staff, and \nreconfiguration of living units has resulted in harm to the residents.  Defendants have failed to \nprotect residents from harm. \n  51\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 52 of 56 PageID: 52\n173.  The actions of the Defendants herein have significantly contributed to and \nincreased the vulnerability of the Plaintiffs and created risks that would not have otherwise \nexisted if Defendants complied with their legal duties. \n174.  Defendants’ actions and inactions constitute a violation of Plaintiffs’ federal \nrights, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and \nother federal laws.  Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to engage in their \nmisbehavior, which deprives the Plaintiffs of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the \nConstitution of the United States and federal law, and will cause irreparable harm to these \nresidents. \n175.  The harm ultimately caused or to be caused to the Plaintiffs was and is \nforeseeable and sufficiently direct. \n176.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief directing that: \n(a)  such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment and \nservices in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n(b)  such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating professionals \nunless the treating professionals conclude that such a placement is in the best \ninterests of the individual Plaintiffs; \n(c)  such discharge or transfer will not occur unless the Plaintiffs, by their \nguardians or families, wish to effect such discharge or transfer; \n(d) the services and care provided by the State at the developmental centers must \nmeet or exceed accepted professional standards, and must be maintained at a \n  52\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 53 of 56 PageID: 53\nlevel at least equal to the care and services that preceded the decision to close \nthe developmental centers; and \n(e) the State must maintain staffing levels for direct care staff and treating \nprofessionals at a level that meets or exceeds accepted professional standards, \nand at a level at least equal to the staffing that preceded the decision to close \nthe developmental centers; \n(f) the State cannot move residents to other ICF’s/IID where their needs cannot be \nadequately met, including, but not limited to, the State cannot move residents \nto an ICF/IID that is so significantly distant from their families and guardians \nthat any individual resident will be harmed in his care, treatment, habilitation, \nor psychological well-being. \n177.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a)  directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared by \nPlaintiffs’ respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants’ political plan to downsize or close any developmental centers, \nand documented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIHPs at NJDC and WDC).   \n(b)  permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary evaluation; \nand \n(ii)  to receive treatment in accordance with the independent recommendations \nof the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at his/her current residence, \n  53\n\nCase 2:13-cv-03478-SRC-CLW   Document 1   Filed 06/05/13   Page 54 of 56 PageID: 54\nanother state operated ICF/IID facility, or non-ICF/IID certified setting, as \nthe Plaintiff deems appropriate. \n \nCONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE Plaintiffs seek: \n(a) Declaratory  and injunctive relief as set forth herein. \n(b)   An award to Plaintiffs’ of reasonable attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, \n.and costs; and  \n(c)  Any other relief this Court deems just and proper.  \n \nJURY DEMAND \nPlaintiffs demand a trial by jury. \n \nRespectfully submitted,   \n                /s/ Thomas A.

(Title II or the ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 \nU.S.C. 794 (Section 504), and the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C., \n527 U.S. 581 (1999), which interpreted the United States Department of Justice’s \nregulations promulgated under Title II of the ADA.  The Department of Justice has\n\n- 2 - \n \nsubstantial enforcement responsibilities under Section 504 and Title II of the ADA.  \nThe Department of Justice issued regulations implementing Section 504 and Title \nII, is authorized to bring civil actions to enforce these statutes, 29 U.S.C. 794, \n794a; 42 U.S.C. 12133-12134; 28 C.F.R. Pts. 35, 41, and coordinates the \nimplementation and enforcement of Section 504 by all federal agencies, 29 U.S.C. \n794a; 28 C.F.R. Pt. 41 & App. A (Exec. Order 12,250), including the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, whose Medicaid Act funds are used \nfor individuals both in institutions and in community placements. \nThe appellants and their amici argue that the appellants have a right under \nOlmstead to remain in a state institution of their choosing.  Opening Br. 8-18; \nAmicus Br. 4, 7-11, 21-22.1  In several recent cases, the United States, as a party or \namicus curiae, argued that Olmstead held only that unnecessary institutionalization \nand segregation violates Title II, and that the integration mandates of Title II, \nSection 504, and the implementing regulations do not create a right to an \ninstitutional placement.  See, e.g., Illinois League of Advocates for the \nDevelopmentally Disabled v. Quinn, 13-CV-1300 (N.D. Ill.); United States v. \nVirginia, 12-CV-59 (E.D. Va.); Carey v. Christie, 12-CV-2522 (D.N.J.); Disability \n                                                 \n1  “Opening Br. __” refers to pages of the plaintiffs-appellants’ opening brief \nfiled in this Court on March 18, 2014.  “Amicus Br. __” refers to pages of the \namicus curiae brief filed by VOR, Inc. (formerly Voice of the Retarded, Inc.) in \nthis Court on March 25, 2014.    \n\n- 3 - \n \nRights N.J., Inc. v. Velez, 05-CV-4723 (D.N.J.).  As the Department enforcing \nTitle II and Section 504 and issuing and overseeing the implementing regulations, \nthe United States has a strong interest in the proper interpretation of these statutes \nand their integration mandates, as interpreted in Olmstead. \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUE \nThe United States’ brief is limited to the following issue: \nWhether the integration mandate of Section 504, Title II, and their \nimplementing regulations, as interpreted in Olmstead, provide a right to receive \nservices in an institution.2 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n1.  Facts And Procedural History \nThe appellants (plaintiffs in the district court) are residents of the \nWoodbridge Developmental Center and the North Jersey Developmental Center.  \nJ.A. 8 (Dec. 13, 2013, Opinion); J.A. 39-45, 50 (Complaint).3  These are \nintermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID), \noperated by the State of New Jersey, that provide housing, habilitation, behavioral, \n                                                 \n2  The United States takes no position on any other issue presented in this \nappeal. \n3  “J.A. __” refers to pages of the consecutively paginated Joint Appendix \nand Addendum filed in this Court on March 18, 2014.  “R. __ at __” refers to \npages of documents filed in the district court, identified by docket number.     \n\n- 4 - \n \nand medical services and support for people with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities.  J.A. 8 (Dec. 13, 2013, Opinion); J.A. 47-48, 50-51 (Complaint).  New \nJersey decided to close these two institutions and offered the appellants the option \nof a community placement or placement at another state institution.  J.A. 8-9 (Dec. \n13, 2013, Opinion).   \nIn their complaint, the appellants alleged that, once New Jersey decided to \nclose these institutions, treating professionals in the institutions have concluded \nthat each of the appellants would be best served in an alternative placement.  J.A. \n58.  The appellants claimed that the assessments supporting alternative placements \nwere politically-motivated and were based on the State’s desire to close the two \ninstitutions rather than the plaintiffs’ actual medical needs, and that the treating \nmedical staff fabricated fitness for community placement.  J.A. 58-59, 64-65, 68-\n69 (Complaint).  The appellants asserted that they have not consented to be \ntransferred to community placements because they have not had the benefit of their \ntreating professionals’ independent judgment as to what placement would be most \nappropriate for each plaintiff.  J.A. 66-69 (Complaint).  The appellants contend that \nthey would be “most appropriately” served at the institutions in which they \ncurrently reside (J.A. 65-66 (Complaint)), and also question the basis on which \nNew Jersey decided to close these two institutions (J.A. 67-68, 71-72 (Complaint)).  \nThe appellants acknowledge, however, that the State has offered them placements \n\n- 5 - \n \nin other institutions.  J.A. 66, 70 (Complaint); see also J.A. 9 (Dec. 13, 2013, \nOpinion); but see Opening Br. 7 n.1. \nOn June 5, 2013, the appellants filed a putative class action on behalf of \nthemselves and all other residents of these two institutions, asserting violations of \nTitle II, Section 504, the Medicaid Act, and the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  J.A. 8-10 (Dec. 13, 2013, Opinion); J.A. 48, 75-87 \n(Complaint).   \nOn September 9, 2013, the state appellees (defendants in the district court) \nmoved to dismiss the complaint.  R. 4.  They argued, in pertinent part, that the \nappellants’ Title II and Section 504 claims should be dismissed because these \nstatutes require that “States * * * serve individuals with disabilities in the least-\nrestrictive environment appropriate to their needs,” and “do not compel a State to \nserve individuals in their chosen institutions.”  R. 4-1 at 8 (Motion to Dismiss).  \nThe state appellees argued that the appellants had failed to state a claim under Title \nII or Section 504 because while both statutes “forbid ‘unjustified \ninstitutionalization,’” neither statute establishes that transferring an individual out \nof a particular institution is discrimination.  R. 4-1 at 13 (Motion to Dismiss) \n(quoting Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 600-601 (1999)). \nOn September 13, 2013, the Department of Justice filed a statement of \ninterest in support of dismissal of the appellants’ Title II and Section 504 claims.  \n\n- 6 - \n \nR. 7.  The Department of Justice argued that the appellants do not have a right \nunder Section 504, Title II, or their implementing regulations to prevent their \ntransfer and thereby to remain in a particular institution.  R. 7 at 5, 7-10 (Statement \nof Interest).  The Department of Justice argued that there is no right under Section \n504 or Title II to placement in a particular institution.  R. 7 at 5, 8-9 (Statement of \nInterest). \n2.  The District Court’s Decision \nOn December 13, 2013, the district court granted the state appellees’ motion \nto dismiss.  J.A. 6-7 (December 13, 2013, Order); J.A. 8-22 (Dec. 13, 2013, \nOpinion).  The district court rejected appellants’ argument that, under Olmstead, \nproviding a community placement can be a form of disability-based discrimination \nprohibited by Section 504 and Title II.  J.A. 14 (Dec. 13, 2013, Opinion).  To the \ncontrary, the district court found that Olmstead established only that it is a \nviolation of Section 504, Title II, and their implementing regulations “‘to force \ndevelopmentally disabled patients to reside in institutions when they are able and \nwilling to live’ in more integrated community settings.”  J.A. 13 (Dec. 13, 2013, \nOpinion) (quoting this Court’s decision in Benjamin v. Department of Pub. \nWelfare, 701 F.3d 938, 942 (3d Cir. 2012)).  Accordingly, the district court held \nthat the appellants’ relocation out of the two institutions slated for closure was not \n\n- 7 - \n \n“discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of federal law” and dismissed \nthe appellants’ Title II and Section 504 claims.  J.A. 15 (Dec. 13, 2013, Opinion). \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe appellants do not have a right enforceable under Title II, Section 504, or \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), to remain in institutions that the State has \ndetermined should be closed.  The appellants argue that Olmstead requires the \nState to permit them to remain in these two institutions unless they consent to \ntransfer, and therefore transferring them against their preference out of the two \nstate institutions slated for closure is actionable discrimination under Title II and \nSection 504.  The appellants and their amici misconstrue the integration mandates \nof Title II, Section 504, and their implementing regulations, distort the holding of \nOlmstead, and attempt to define a new form of discrimination not contemplated by \nthese statutes.  The district court properly rejected these arguments, and this Court \nshould affirm dismissal of the appellants’ Title II and Section 504 claims.      \n\n- 8 - \n \nARGUMENT \nTHE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT THERE IS NO \nENFORCEABLE RIGHT TO REMAIN IN AN INSTITUTION UNDER \nTITLE II, SECTION 504, OR OLMSTEAD \n \nA.  Congress Enacted Section 504 And The ADA To Eliminate Discrimination \nAgainst Individuals With Disabilities, Including Isolation, Segregation, And \nUnnecessary Institutionalization \n \nSection 504 and the ADA redress discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities, which includes isolation, segregation, and unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.  Nothing in the statutory text, legislative histories, or \nimplementing regulations supports the appellants’ argument that transferring \nindividuals from a facility slated for closure is actionable discrimination under \nSection 504, Title II, or their implementing regulations, as interpreted in Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). \n1.  Section 504 “was the first broad federal statute aimed at eradicating \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.”  Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d \n325, 330 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 (1995).  Section 504 provides that \n“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability * * * shall, solely by reason \nof her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. 794(a).   \n\n- 9 - \n \nWith this law, Congress sought to rectify “the country’s ‘shameful \noversights,’ which caused the handicapped to live among society ‘shunted aside, \nhidden, and ignored’” and to be “invisibl[e] * * * in America.”  Alexander v. \nChoate, 469 U.S. 287, 295-296 (1985) (quoting 117 Cong. Rec. 45,974 (1971); \n118 Cong. Rec. 525-526 (1972)).  Accordingly, as part of its anti-discrimination \nprecepts, Section 504 regulations have an “integration mandate” that requires \nrecipients of federal funds to “administer programs and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.”  28 \nC.F.R. 41.51(d).  In this manner, “Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act has served \nnot only to open up public services and programs to people with disabilities but has \nalso been used to end segregation.”  H.R. Rep. No. 485(III), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. \n49 (1990) (House Report (Part III)). \n2.  In the late 1980s, Congress acknowledged that “then current laws were \n‘inadequate’ to combat ‘the pervasive problems of discrimination that people with \ndisabilities are facing.’”  Helen L., 46 F.3d at 330 (quoting S. Rep. No. 116, 101st \nCong., 1st Sess. 18 (1989) (Senate Report)); H.R. Rep. No. 485(II), 101st Cong., \n2d Sess. 47 (1990) (House Report (Part II)).  Some of the forms of discrimination \nthat concerned Congress were segregation of individuals with disabilities in \ninstitutions and their concomitant exclusion from the community and society at \nlarge.  Senate Report 6 (“One of the most debilitating forms of discrimination is \n\n- 10 - \n \nsegregation imposed by others.”); House Report (Part II) 29 (“Discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities includes segregation[] [and] exclusion.”).  “Both \nbranches of Congress concluded:  ‘[T]here is a compelling need to provide a clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities and for the integration of persons with disabilities into \nthe economic and social mainstream of American life.’”  Helen L., 46 F.3d at 331 \n(quoting Senate Report 20; House Report (Part II) 50); see also H.R. Rep. No. \n485(IV), 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 23 (1990).   \nTo this end, Congress enacted the ADA in 1990.  “The ADA is a \ncomprehensive piece of civil rights legislation which promises a new future:  a \nfuture of inclusion and integration, and the end of exclusion and segregation.”  \nHouse Report (Part III) 26.  Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of \na public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C.  \n12132.  Title II “incorporates the ‘non-discrimination principles’ of [S]ection 504    \n* * * and extends them to state and local governments.”  Helen L., 46 F.3d at 331 \n(quoting Easley v. Snider, 36 F.3d 297, 300 (3d Cir. 1994)).  The ADA specifies \nthat discrimination against individuals with disabilities includes “segregation” and \n“institutionalization.”  42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3) and (5). \n\n- 11 - \n \nAs part of the ADA, Congress set forth findings that indicate the legislation \nwas intended to, among other things, remedy the unnecessary isolation and \nsegregation of persons with disabilities, including institutionalization.  Congress \nspecifically found that “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate \nindividuals with disabilities, and * * * such forms of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem”; \nthat “discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical \nareas as * * * institutionalization”; and that “the Nation’s proper goals regarding \nindividuals with disabilities are to assure * * * full participation[] [and] \nindependent living.”  42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(2)-(3) and (7); see also House Report \n(Part III) 49-50 (“The purpose of [T]itle II is to continue to break down barriers to \nthe integrated participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of community \nlife.”).  These findings reveal Congress’s judgment that the impermissible \ndiscrimination the ADA was intended to redress includes unnecessary \ninstitutionalization.   \n3.  The ADA directs the Department of Justice to promulgate implementing \nregulations.  42 U.S.C. 12134.  Congress specified that such regulations “shall be \nconsistent” with the ADA and with the “coordination regulations” issued under \nSection 504.  42 U.S.C. 12134(b).  The specified “coordination regulations” \ninclude Section 504’s integration mandate regulation, 28 C.F.R. 41.51(d).  \n\n- 12 - \n \nTherefore, in enacting the ADA, Congress specifically ratified the integration \nmandate previously promulgated under Section 504.   \nConsistent with congressional directive, the Department of Justice \npromulgated regulations that include an integration mandate identical to that found \nin Section 504’s regulations:  “A public entity shall administer services, programs, \nand activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. 35.130(d); see also 28 C.F.R. 41.51(d).  \nThe preamble to the Department’s Title II regulations explains that “[i]ntegration is \nfundamental to the purposes of the [ADA].”  28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B at 682; Final \nRule, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government \nServices, 56 Fed. Reg. 35,694, 35,703 (July 26, 1991).  The Department further \nexplained that the “most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities” means “a setting that enables individuals with \ndisabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 \nC.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B at 685; 56 Fed. Reg. at 35,705. \nThe statutory language, purpose, history, and implementing regulations \nreveal that Section 504 and the ADA seek to integrate individuals with disabilities \ninto the social mainstream.  These authorities do not create a right to institutional \nplacement.   \n\n- 13 - \n \nB.  Olmstead Held Only That Unnecessary Segregation Of Individuals With \nDisabilities In Institutions Is Discrimination Under Title II And Its \nImplementing Regulations \n \nThe appellants and their amici incorrectly claim that because the appellants \ndo not consent to their transfer, they have a right under Olmstead to remain in a \nstate institution slated for closure.  Opening Br. 12-13; Amicus Br. 6-11.  This \nargument misstates the issue presented in Olmstead and the Court’s holding. \nIn the Olmstead plurality decision, the Supreme Court interpreted Title II’s \nanti-discrimination provision and its integration mandate.  After examining \ncongressional findings, statutory language, implementing regulations, and the \nviews of the government, the majority of the Court held that “[u]njustified isolation \n* * * is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability” under Title II of \nthe ADA.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597.  Therefore, Title II “require[s] placement of \npersons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in institutions    \n* * * when the State’s treatment professionals have determined that community \nplacement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive \nsetting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be \nreasonably accommodated.”  Id. at 587.   \nBecause the two Olmstead plaintiffs were qualified for and desired a \ncommunity placement, the Court did not decide any issue related to individuals \nwith disabilities who prefer to receive services only in an institution.  See 527 U.S. \n\n- 14 - \n \nat 593, 602-603.  In fact, the majority of the Court specifically noted that there was \n“no genuine dispute” that the two plaintiffs were qualified for and desired a \ncommunity placement.  Id. at 602-603.  Thus, the only issue the majority of the \nCourt decided in Olmstead was whether the State had impermissibly discriminated \nagainst the two plaintiffs in that case by unnecessarily continuing to keep them in \nan institution.4   \nIn the course of the opinion, the majority held that, consistent with the ADA \nand its regulations, a State must provide services in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to a person’s needs.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587, 597.  The Court also \nexplained that there was no “federal requirement that community-based treatment \nbe imposed on patients who do not desire it.”  Id. at 602 (citing 42 U.S.C. 12132; \n28 C.F.R. 35.130(d) and (e)(1)).  This observation that federal law does not require \na community placement when it is not desired does not, however, create a right for \nany individuals with a disability to remain in an institution or to choose a particular \ninstitution in which they will receive services.  This is evident from the majority’s \nstatement that “[w]e do not in this opinion hold that the ADA imposes on the \nStates a ‘standard of care’ for whatever medical services they render, or that the \n                                                 \n4  The Olmstead decision also discussed a State’s fundamental alteration \ndefense; however, this portion of the opinion was joined by only four Justices.  527 \nU.S. at 587. \n\n- 15 - \n \nADA requires States to provide a certain level of benefits to individuals with \ndisabilities.”  Id. at 603 n.14 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).   \nThe appellants’ and their amici’s claim that Olmstead confers a right to \ninstitutional services (see Opening Br. 8-13; Amicus Br. 7-11) is in direct conflict \nwith this statement from the Olmstead majority, see 527 U.S. at 603 n.14.  As the \ntext of the majority’s decision makes clear, States are not required to offer a certain \nlevel of benefits or type of care.  Rather, the Olmstead majority held “that States \nmust adhere to the ADA’s nondiscrimination requirement with regard to the \nservices they in fact provide.”  Ibid.   \nIn Olmstead, the Supreme Court decided that unnecessary segregation in an \ninstitution was a form of discrimination on the basis of disability.  527 U.S. at 597 \n(“Unjustified isolation, we hold, is properly regarded as discrimination based on \ndisability.”); see also id. at 600 (“Congress explicitly identified unjustified \n‘segregation’ of persons with disabilities as a ‘for[m] of discrimination.’”) \n(brackets in original; citation omitted).  Olmstead did not review the \nappropriateness of the medical care either of the two plaintiffs was receiving, nor \ndid it create a right for individuals to use the ADA to challenge the care they are \nreceiving by alleging that the treatment is discrimination on the basis of disability.  \nSee id. at 603 n.14.  The fact that Title II and Olmstead require a State to place \npeople in community-based settings when the individuals do not oppose and are \n\n- 16 - \n \nappropriately suited for such placements does not establish, as a matter of anti-\ndiscrimination law, that there is a legally enforceable prohibition on such \nplacements absent consent under the nondiscrimination language of Section 504 or \nthe ADA. \nC.  The Department Of Justice’s Views On The Proper Interpretation Of Title II  \nWarrant Respect And Substantial Deference \nThe Supreme Court recognized in Olmstead that as the federal agency \ncharged with issuing Title II’s implementing regulations, the Department of \nJustice’s views on the proper interpretation of Title II “warrant respect.”  527 U.S. \nat 597-598; see also Helen L., 46 F.3d at 331-332 (noting that the Department of \nJustice’s regulations, interpretation of Title II, and construction of the statutory \nscheme should be given “substantial deference” and “[c]onsiderable weight”) \n(citation omitted).  The Department of Justice has consistently taken the position \nthat the discrimination Title II prohibits includes unnecessary institutionalization of \nindividuals with disabilities.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597-598.  The Department of \nJustice’s consistent position has been that nothing in the ADA, its implementing \nregulations, or the Olmstead decision supports the appellants’ charge that \ntransferring individuals with disabilities to an integrated setting, or if they prefer, \nanother institution, constitutes discrimination.  \nTo be sure, the ADA provides that it shall not “be construed to require an \nindividual with a disability to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, \n\n- 17 - \n \nor benefit which such individual chooses not to accept.”  42 U.S.C. 12201(d); see \nalso 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. B at 685 (providing that “persons with disabilities must \nbe provided the option of declining to accept a particular accommodation”).  The \nDepartment of Justice has explained that this provision and corresponding \nregulation were added to make clear that the ADA does not require individuals \nwith disabilities to accept special accommodations and services aimed at \nindividuals with disabilities where those accommodations or services actually may \nsegregate those individuals.  56 Fed. Reg. at 35,705.  Instead, those individuals \nmay choose to participate in the regular services already offered to individuals \nwithout disabilities.  Ibid.  For example, “a blind individual may choose to decline \nto participate in a special museum tour that allows persons to touch sculptures in \nan exhibit and instead tour the exhibits at his or her own pace with the museum’s \nrecorded tour.”  Ibid.  The right this language establishes to refuse an offered \nmodification or accommodation does not create a right to institutionalized care.  As \nexplained previously, the ADA prohibits discrimination, one form of which is \nunnecessary isolation, segregation, and institutionalization.  See pp. 12-15, 17-18, \nsupra.  It would be incongruous to interpret statutory language and an \nimplementing regulation, as the appellants do here, to defeat that Congressional \ngoal. \n\n- 18 - \n \nD.  The Appellants May Not Contest Their Transfer From Institutions The State \nHas Selected For Closure Under Title II, Section 504, Or Olmstead \n \nNothing in Title II or Olmstead forbids a State from closing an institution.  \nSee Baccus v. Parrish, 45 F.3d 958, 961 (5th Cir. 1995) (rejecting plaintiffs’ \nchallenge to a state task force’s recommendation to close two schools for people \nwith intellectual disabilities because “the state reserves the right to unilaterally \nclose a state school for administrative or financial reasons, even if it means that \ncertain residents will have to relocate as a result”); Rolland v. Patrick, 562 F. \nSupp. 2d 176, 185 (D. Mass. 2008), aff’d, 592 F.3d 242 (1st Cir. 2010); Lelsz v. \nKavanagh, 783 F. Supp. 286, 298 (N.D. Tex. 1991), aff’d, 983 F.2d 1061 (5th \nCir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 906 (1993); cf. Ricci v. Patrick, 544 F.3d 8, 16-20 (1st \nCir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1166 (2009) (reversing the district court’s \nreopening of the case because the Commonwealth had fully complied with the \nconsent decree in closing a state-run institution and transferring its residents to \nother facilities).  There is no legal requirement under Section 504 or the ADA that \nany State create or maintain such an institution.5 \n                                                 \n5  As of 2011, Alaska, Michigan, and Oregon had no institutions for \nindividuals with developmental disabilities, and eight additional States had no \nindividuals in large, state-operated institutions like the Woodbridge Developmental \nCenter and the North Jersey Developmental Center.  See University of Minnesota, \nResearch & Training Center on Community Living, Institute on Community \nIntegration (UCEDD), Residential Services for Persons with Intellectual and \n(continued…) \n\n- 19 - \n \nAny alleged right to remain in a specific state institution would directly \ncontradict the statutory language of Section 504 and the ADA, their legislative \nhistories, and implementing regulations, all of which focus on \ndeinstitutionalization as a part of eliminating discrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities.  See pp. 8-12, supra.  Consistent with this, Olmstead’s only \nholding was that “unjustified isolation” – i.e., continued institutionalization when a \ncommunity placement is appropriate, not objected to, and can be reasonably \naccommodated – constitutes impermissible discrimination under Title II.  Id. at \n587, 597.  There is no basis in the language or purpose of the ADA, Section 504, or \nOlmstead to support a claim that placing an individual with disabilities in an \nintegrated setting is similarly discriminatory. \nThe appellants therefore do not have a right under Title II, Section 504, or \nOlmstead to remain in institutions that the State has determined should be closed.  \nThis is precisely the holding of every identifiable decision that has directly \nexamined this issue.  See, e.g., Illinois League of Advocates for Developmentally \nDisabled v. Quinn, No. 13-C-1300, 2013 WL 3168758, at *5 (N.D. Ill. June 20, \n2013) (“Unjustified isolation constitutes discrimination under the ADA, but * * * it \ndoes not follow from Olmstead that the converse is true.”) (citation and internal \n                                                 \n(…continued) \nDevelopmental Disabilities:  Status and Trends Through Fiscal Year 2011, Table \n3.1, http://rtc.umn.edu/risp/docs/risp2011.pdf. \n\n- 20 - \n \nquotation marks omitted); Richard C. v. Houstoun, 196 F.R.D. 288, 292 (W.D. Pa. \n1999) (“[I]t does not logically follow that institutionalization is required if any one \nof the three Olmstead criteria is not met.”).   \nThe authorities the appellants and their amici cite do not hold to the \ncontrary.  See Opening Br. 13-15; Amicus Br. 11-15.  The cases on which they rely \nprimarily are decisions deciding motions to intervene that obliquely reference \nOlmstead and address other legal issues.  See, e.g., Ligas v. Maram, 478 F.3d 771 \n(7th Cir. 2007).  Indeed, in Ligas, the Seventh Circuit recognized that “Olmstead \nestablished that it is a violation of the ADA to force developmentally disabled \npatients to reside in institutionalized settings when they are able to live more fully \nintegrated into society at large and do not oppose doing so.”  Id. at 773.  Not a \nsingle decision cited in the appellants’ or amici’s briefs directly supports the \nproposition that Olmstead creates a right to continued institutionalization. \nNor does this Court’s decision in Benjamin v. Department of Public Welfare, \n701 F.3d 938, 942 (3d Cir. 2012), support the appellants’ Title II or Section 504 \nclaims.  In Benjamin, individuals who lived in an institution who were eligible for \nand desired community placements filed a class action under Olmstead to force the \nState to establish a plan to transfer them into the community.  701 F.3d at 941.  \nAfter settlement was entered, this Court held that the district court should have \nallowed the proposed intervenors, a group of residents who opposed community \n\n- 21 - \n \nplacements for themselves, to intervene at the remedy stage in order to challenge \nthe settlement agreement and class certification.  Id. at 941-942, 947-948.  This \nCourt found that the settlement agreement between the class plaintiffs (the \nresidents who wanted community placements) and Pennsylvania could affect the \ninterests of the proposed intervenors (the residents who did not want community \nplacements).  Id. at 952. \nBenjamin has little impact on the present case.  Benjamin addressed only a \nmotion to intervene under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2); it did not \naddress whether Section 504, the ADA, or their implementing regulations, as \ninterpreted in Olmstead, create a right to institutionalization.  See 701 F.3d at 957.  \nThe appellants here acknowledge that, in Benjamin, this Court did not reach the \nquestion whether the proposed intervenors opposing community placement had a \nlegally enforceable right to remain in the institution where they resided.  Opening \nBr. 13-14.   \nThe appellants, however, incorrectly argue that this Court’s introductory \ncomment in Benjamin that “Olmstead and the regulations make clear that \n‘community based treatment [cannot] be imposed on patients who do not desire \nit,’” 701 F.3d at 942 – which the appellants acknowledge is merely dictum – \nsomehow constitutes an “acknowledge[ment] that the residents and guardians may \nhave ADA or other rights” to remain in an institution (Opening Br. 13-14).  The \n\n- 22 - \n \nappellants ascribe far too much weight to this Court’s passing remark and also \noverlook the fact that Olmstead stated only that there is no “federal requirement \nthat community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.”  527 \nU.S. at 602.  The fact that there is no federal requirement for community \nplacements for individuals who do not consent to such a placement does not give \nrise to a claim for discrimination when a State chooses to close an institution and \ntransfer individuals with disabilities from an institutional setting.  See pp. 15-16, \nsupra.  Neither Olmstead nor Benjamin holds that the ADA creates an independent \nright for an individual with disabilities to remain in an institution, or that \ntransferring an individual from an institution slated for closure violates Section 504 \nor the ADA. \nWhat is more, the appellants in this case stand in significantly different \nshoes from those of the proposed intervenors in Benjamin and other cited cases.  \nThe factual background and issue presented in this case are distinct from those \npresented in Benjamin.  Here, the appellants are not opposing or attempting to \nintervene in a class action by institutionalized individuals who consent to and who \ncan be appropriately and reasonably accommodated in community placements.  \nTherefore, unlike in Benjamin, in this case, there is no need to evaluate the effects \non the appellants here of a settlement agreement or future relief to a class.   \n\n- 23 - \n \nIn this case, the State has decided to close two institutions and has offered \nappellants the option of moving to either a community placement or, while not \nrequired under Section 504 or Title II, another institution.  J.A. 9 (Dec. 13, 2013, \nOpinion); J.A. 66, 70 (Complaint); but see Opening Br. 7 n.1.  This Court’s \nconcern in Benjamin about the possibility of the proposed intervenors being placed \ninto the community without their consent is simply not presented in this case.  See \n701 F.3d at 952, 954-956.  Although not required by Section 504 or Title II, there \nis no current or future impediment to the appellants in this case receiving services \nin a state institution, as they request; indeed, the appellants admit that the State has \noffered them an alternate institutional placement.  J.A. 66, 70 (Complaint); see also \nJ.A. 9 (Dec. 13, 2013, Opinion); but see Opening Br. 7 n.1.  The appellants do not, \nhowever, have the right they seek under Section 504, Title II, or Olmstead to select \nwhich particular institution that will be.6  See Baccus, 45 F.3d at 961; Rolland, 562 \n                                                 \n6  The United States does not take a position on the appellants’ Medicaid Act \nclaims.  The United States notes, however, that the administrative appeals process \navailable within the State provides an avenue for the appellants to raise their \nconcerns with the State’s assessments and placement decisions.  See N.J. Admin. \nCode 10:48-1.1 et seq. (2014).  In addition, the Medicaid Act places certain \nobligations on States.  For example, to be eligible for the waiver program for \ncommunity-based services, a State must take necessary safeguards to protect the \nhealth and welfare of individuals receiving waiver services, 42 U.S.C. \n1396n(c)(2)(A), and must provide evaluations of the level of need, 42 U.S.C. \n1396n(c)(2)(B).  Individuals must be given the choice of feasible alternatives \navailable under the waiver program, or institutional level services otherwise \navailable, which are not required to be provided in a particular facility.  42 U.S.C. \n(continued…) \n\n- 24 - \n \nF. Supp. 2d at 185; Lelsz, 783 F. Supp. at 298; cf. Ricci, 544 F.3d at 16-20.  \nIndeed, the appellants cite nothing to support that argument. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated herein, this Court should affirm dismissal of the \nappellants’ Title II and Section 504 claims. \n              Respectfully submitted, \nJOCELYN SAMUELS \n                Acting Assistant Attorney General \n \n              s/ Erin Aslan \n              MARK L.
