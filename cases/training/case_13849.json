The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for various forms of injunctive relief, claiming that the state was in violation of the ADA, Section 504, the Medicaid Act, and plaintiffs' substantive due process rights.  Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that discharges or transfers were being forced upon plaintiffs without their consent, or the consent of their guardians or families; that plaintiffs were being discharged from the Vineland Developmental Center to other settings in violation of Section 504's mandate that the state implement its services and programs in \"the most integrated setting appropriate\" to meet plaintiffs' needs; that defendants have not met plaintiffs' needs under their multidisciplinary plans according to the Medicaid Act; and that plaintiffs' substantive due process rights were being violated by placing plaintiffs in other settings, subjecting them to an increased likelihood of injury and death from abuse, neglect, error, and lack of appropriate services.</p><p>On March 19, 2013, the Court (District Judge Renée Marie Bumb) granted the State's motion to dismiss, stating only that it was granting the motion for \"the reasons stated at oral argument.\"  No transcript of the proceeding is available.  The Court allowed plaintiffs 45 days to file an amended complaint.</p><p>However, on May 2, 2013, plaintiffs asked the Court to grant a voluntary dismissal.  The plaintiffs stated that they would \"wait until the inevitable harm by the State becomes more evident and imminent,\" and that they would \"seek to restart or to revive this litigation when appropriate.\"  The Court granted plaintiffs' request and dismissed the action on May 6, 2013.</p>",

The action was dismissed in March of 2013, and rather than filing an amended complaint, plaintiffs sought voluntary dismissal, stating they would revive the litigation when the harms alleged became more evident and imminent.

P. 23(a) and (b)(2), the Named Plaintiffs bring this action \non behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. \n19. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to the Civil Rights Act, 42 USC § 1983; the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 USC § 12132; § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC § \n794 (\"Section 504\"), and the waiver of state sovereign immunity enacted in 42 USC § 2000d-\n7(a)( 1), various Medicaid federal statutes, and regulations incorporated into New Jersey law and \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 6 of 27 PageID: 6\nthe United States Constitution, on behalf of a Class consisting of themselves and all other \npersons who are residents of the Vineland Developmental Center, Cumberland County, New \nJersey, as of April 25, 2010. \n20. The proposed class consists of: New Jersey residents who reside or resided at the \nVineland Developmental Center, at anytime since April 25, 2010, or at any time during this \nlitigation. \n21. Joinder of the entire Class is impracticable because the Class Members are \nseverely or profoundly developmentally disabled persons. Virtually all Class Members are \nunable to give their consent except through guardians or family members. \n22. Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims asserted on behalf of the Class. \n23. Plaintiffs do not have any interests that are adverse or antagonistic to any claims \nor potential claims of the Class. \n24. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the \nClass. \n25. Plaintiffs are committed to the vigorous prosecution of this action and have \nretained counsel competent and experienced in this type of litigation. \n26. Plaintiffs do not seek monetary damages. Hence, the burden and expense of \nprosecuting this litigation makes it unlikely that members of the Class would or could prosecute \nindividual actions. If individual actions were pursued by Class Members, prosecution of those \nindividual claims would be impracticable and inefficient. \n27. Plaintiffs are not aware of any pending litigation concerning the claims herein. \n28. This Court is the most appropriate forum for adjudicating the claims at issue, \nwhich arise under federal law. \n6 \n\n(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 7 of 27 PageID: 7\n29. (cid:9) Plaintiffs do not anticipate any difficulty in the management of this action as a \nClass action. \n30. (cid:9) There are many questions of law and fact common to the Class, which \npredominate over any questions which may affect individual members. The predominant \ncommon questions of law and fact include, among others: \n(a) Whether Defendants are liable for violation of the Civil Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983; \n(b) Whether Defendants are liable for violation of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; \n(c) Whether Defendants are liable for violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"Section 504\"), and the waiver of state sovereign \nimmunity enacted in 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(1); \n(d) Whether Defendants are liable for violation of various Medicaid federal \nstatutes and regulations incorporated into New Jersey law; \n(e) Whether Defendants are liable for violations of the United States \nConstitution; and \nWhether named Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to equitable and \n(f)\ninjunctive relief. \n31. (cid:9) A Class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. \n32. (cid:9) Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and expenses as \npermitted by law, on behalf of themselves and the Class. \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 8 of 27 PageID: 8\nCOMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS.  \n33. All plaintiffs reside at the Vineland Developmental Center or resided there as of \nApril 25, 2010. \n34. All of the residents of Vineland Developmental Center are females. Almost all of \nVineland's residents have lived in their homes at the Vineland Developmental Center for many \nyears, with 68 percent of those residents having lived there for more than 30 years. \n35. The Vineland Developmental Center is an Intermediate Care Facility for the \nMentally Retarded (\"ICF/MR\") operated by the State of New Jersey. It is licensed to serve 556 \nresidents, and currently serves approximately 347 individuals. \n36. ICF/MR certified facilities are regulated by the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid (\"CMS\") in conjunction with the state's licensing agency. Part of that regulatory \nprocess includes routine surveys by CMS and the state's licensing agency to ensure quality \ntreatment and services are provided by ICF/MR certified facilities, like Vineland Developmental \nCenter. \n37. Eligibility for residence in a New Jersey developmental center is defined by \nSection 1.3 of Division Circular #3, N.J.A.C. 10:46-1.3, effective March 24, 2011. That \nregulation defines the developmental disability that must be present in order to receive services \nas a severe, chronic disability of an individual, which is attributable to a mental impairment, \nphysical impairment, or combination of both; is manifested before age 22; is likely to continue \nindefinitely; results in a combination of functional limitations in major life activities; reflects the \nneed for a combination of special interdisciplinary care or treatment of lifelong or extended \nduration; and includes, but is not limited to, developmental disabilities, autism, cerebral palsy, \nepilepsy, spina bifida, and other neurological impairments. \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 9 of 27 PageID: 9\n38. All plaintiffs are diagnosed as in need of state-run ICF/MR institutional care and \nhave been appropriately designated as eligible for state-operated ICF/MR level of care. \n39. Eighty-six percent of the individuals residing at the Vineland Developmental \nCenter have been diagnosed with profound or severe intellectual disabilities. Approximately 13 \npercent of individuals residing at the Vineland Developmental Center have been assessed with \nmild or moderate levels of intellectual disability Almost all individuals residing at the Vineland \nDevelopmental Center have been diagnosed with additional disabilities, including: 65 percent of \nthe population diagnosed with seizure disorders, 17 percent diagnosed with autism, and 28 \npercent diagnosed with cerebral palsy. In addition, 46 percent have vision difficulties, and 12 \npercent have hearing impairments. \n40. The primary service needs of individuals at Vineland require a variety of services \nand supports. Four broad areas of service are described below, along with the number of \nindividuals for whom that service is their primary need: \n(a) Extensive Personal Care - Approximately three-hundred VDC individuals \nrequire extensive personal care. This need refers to people who require \ntotal assistance and care provided by direct service staff who are specially \ntrained on individualized programs developed by residents' treating \nprofessionals, including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, \noccupational therapists, speech language pathologists, and many other \nlicensed clinicians who treat residents at the Center. \n(b) Significant Health Care Services — Treating professionals at Vineland \nhave determined that significant nursing intervention and monitoring are \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 10 of 27 PageID: 10\nrequired to effectively treat about seventy Vineland residents, who have \nsignificant health care needs. This service includes the need for 24-hour \nmonitoring and immediate availability of treating professionals for \nintermittent pressure breathing, inhalation assistive devices, tracheotomy \ncare, or treatment for recurrent pneumonias or apnea. \n(c) Ambulation - Approximately 37 percent of Vineland residents are non-\nambulatory or require assistance with ambulation. \n(d) Significant Behavioral Support - Approximately sixty-three individuals \nresiding at Vineland require significant behavioral support. This need \naddresses individuals who have behaviors that require intervention for the \nsafety of themselves or others, as developed by psychologists and medical \npersonnel and implemented in conjunction with direct service staff \n41. Prior to 2010, all Vineland residents were consistently evaluated by their treating \nprofessionals and determined to be in need of ICF/MR services and that the best setting for \nPlaintiffs to receive those services was at the Vineland Developmental Center. Subsequent to \nDefendants' decision to close the Vineland Developmental Center, treating professionals have \nconcluded that Plaintiffs would best be served in alternative settings, including settings that do \nnot provide ICF/MR level of care. \n42. All Plaintiffs have the right to receive ICF/MR level services from the State of \nNew Jersey. \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 11 of 27 PageID: 11\n43. All plaintiffs have or imminently will have their rights to receive ICF/MR level \nservices at the Vineland Developmental Center denied. \n44. Defendants seek to compel Plaintiffs' discharge from Vineland Developmental \nCenter to other settings, including non-ICF/MR certified settings. \n45. Defendants' policies and procedures have usurped Plaintiffs' treating \nprofessionals' ability to make independent professional judgments. \n46. Defendants' policies and procedures have compelled Plaintiffs' treating \nprofessionals to recommend transfer or discharge of Plaintiffs to settings that are not the most \nappropriate for Plaintiffs' needs, solely for the purpose of conforming to Defendants' policy \ndecisions. \n47. All Plaintiffs are medically and developmentally most appropriately served at the \nVineland Developmental Center instead of any alternative setting. \n48. All Plaintiffs are physically, mentally, and emotionally fragile and are most \nappropriately served at the Vineland Developmental Center instead of any alternative setting. \n49. All Plaintiffs are in need of continuous care by multidisciplinary teams of \nprofessionals as are currently serving them at the Vineland Developmental Center. \n50. The services provided to Plaintiffs cannot be reasonably replicated in alternative \nresidential settings. \n51. Non-ICF/MR certified settings are necessarily not able to reasonably provide the \nsame level of care as an ICF/MR certified facility. \n52. Services provided to residents at the Vineland Developmental Center are uniquely \ntailored to the needs of the residents of the Center. \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 12 of 27 PageID: 12\n53. None of the Plaintiffs have given informed consent for their discharge from \nVineland Developmental Center because, among other things, Defendants have precluded \ntreating professionals at the Vineland Developmental Center from fully and fairly considering \nPlaintiffs' rights to receive treatment and services at Vineland Developmental Center. \n54. Plaintiffs have not had the benefit of their respective treating professionals' \nindependent judgment about whether they should continue to reside at Vineland Developmental \nCenter, another state operated ICF/MR, or a non-ICF/MR certified setting. \n55. Defendants have compelled or will compel Plaintiffs to receive services in non-\nICF/MR facilities. Those services are inferior to the services provided at Vineland \nDevelopmental Center because, among other reasons, they will not be provided by an \nindividualized, multidisciplinary team of professionals. \n56. Research demonstrates that intellectually disabled persons, residing in the type of \nsettings to which Defendants intend to discharge Plaintiffs, are at approximately 75 percent \ngreater risk of death, abuse, and neglect as compared to similar persons receiving services at a \nfacility like Vineland Developmental Center. \n57. Defendants know or should know of the increased danger of death, abuse, and \nneglect to which Plaintiffs will be subjected if they are discharged from the Vineland Center in \naccordance with Defendants' political plan. \n58. Research demonstrates that intellectually disabled persons, residing in the type of \nsettings to which Defendants intend to discharge Plaintiffs, are likely to be secluded from the \ncommunity immediately surrounding them and be more restricted in their interactions with non-\ndisabled peers as compared to similar persons receiving services at a facility like Vineland \nDevelopmental Center. \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 13 of 27 PageID: 13\n59. In May 2011, Defendants announced their plan to \"depopulate\" and close the \nVineland Developmental Center and discharge residents to non-ICF/MR certified, alternative \nsettings. \n60. Among the reasons identified by Defendants for their \"depopulation\" plan was the \nostensibly high cost of providing the necessary services for the disabled residents of the state's \ndevelopmental centers. \n61. As part of that plan, Defendants also announced that they would close the West \nCampus of the Vineland Developmental Center. Defendants have taken significant steps in that \nplan and their plan to completely close the Vineland Developmental Center, including \ntransferring and discharging residents without adequate transition plans, without guardian or \nresidents' full and fair participation, without treating professionals' independent and sound \nassessments, without regard for residents' specific individual needs and desires, and without \nregard for the rights of residents. \n62. Contrary to Defendants' public statements, Plaintiffs have not requested discharge \nor transition from Vineland Developmental Center. \n63. Defendants have instructed Plaintiffs' treating professionals to include language \nin Plaintiffs' individual habilitation plans indicating that Plaintiffs are capable of being served in \nsettings other than Vineland Developmental Center, regardless of whether Plaintiffs are actually \ncapable of being served in alternative settings. \n64. Defendants have instructed Plaintiffs' treating professionals to include language \nin Plaintiffs' individual habilitation plans indicating that Plaintiffs have requested discharge to \nsettings other than Vineland Developmental Center, regardless of whether Plaintiffs actually \ncommunicated such a request. \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 14 of 27 PageID: 14\n65. Because Plaintiffs' treating professionals have not been able to provide \nindependent judgments about Plaintiffs' ability to be served in alternative settings, none of the \njudgments they have made in that regard are reliable and accurate. \n66. None of the Plaintiffs have been provided sufficient information to allow them to \nprovide informed consent to discharge. \n67. Defendants have made the decision to depopulate the Vineland Developmental \nCenter without regard to the needs of the individual Plaintiffs, their individual support plans, \nwhich are developed in conjunction with their treating professionals, or their rights to receive \nservices in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs. \n68. On December 14, 2011, the New Jersey Legislature enacted a statute, which, \namong other things, created a \"Task Force on the Closure of State Developmental Centers.\" \nSenate No. 2928, Chapter 143 P.L. 2011. \n69. The legislation and creation of the Task Force is further evidence of Defendants' \nunlawful treatment of Plaintiffs because it presumes that current residents of the State's \nDevelopmental Centers, including Vineland, can be discharged without regard for whether the \nresidents' needs are currently being met in the most integrated setting or whether residents' \nneeds can be served in an alternative setting. By assuming that any of the State's Developmental \nCenters should be closed, that legislation largely ignores the needs of the residents in all of those \nfacilities. The Task Force has rendered opinions that are flawed because they are based on faulty \ndata. \n70. Plaintiffs who have already been discharged from Vineland Developmental \nCenter are being denied access to the same level of treatment and services they received at the \nVineland Developmental Center. \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 15 of 27 PageID: 15\n71. Plaintiffs currently residing at Vineland Developmental Center will be denied \naccess to their current high level of treatment and services if the Defendants continue with their \ncurrent plan to discharge residents. \nCOMMON ALLEGATIONS OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES.  \n72. As described more fully herein, each Plaintiff has a constitutional right, a life and \nliberty interest in, and a statutory entitlement to receive treatment and services from the State of \nNew Jersey in the most appropriate setting for his or her needs. \n73. Interpreting the ADA and the Department of Justice's regulations issued under it, \nthe Supreme Court decision in Olmstead emphasized that there is no \"federal requirement that \ncommunity-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.\" Olmstead v. Zimring, \net al., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999). The Olmstead Court further stressed that \"nothing in the ADA \nor its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable \nto handle or benefit from community settings.\" Id. at 601-02. \"[T]he ADA is not reasonably read \nto impel States to phase out institutions, placing patients in need of close care at risk.\" Id. at 605. \n74. In fact, the Olmstead decision recognized that \"for [some] individuals, no \nplacement outside the institution may ever be appropriate.\" Id. (citing and quoting Brief for \nAmerican Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae at 22-23 (\"Some individuals, whether \nmentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times—perhaps in the short run, \nperhaps in the long run—for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of \ncommunity settings\"); Brief for Voice of the Retarded et al. as Amici Curiae at 11 (\"Each \ndisabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that person—\nrecognizing that, on a case-by-case basis, that setting may be in an institution\"); Youngberg v.  \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 327 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (\"For many mentally retarded \n15 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 16 of 27 PageID: 16\npeople, the difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution and \ntotal dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will \nknow\"). \n75. By virtue of the ADA and the Olmstead decision, Plaintiffs have a federally-\nprotected right to receive recommendations from treating professionals as to whether community \nplacement is the most appropriate to their needs and to fair consideration of their opposition to \nthat transfer, even if the proposed transfer is from institutional care to an allegedly less restrictive \nsetting. The only proper mechanism for second-guessing an individual or guardian's decision to \noppose a treating professional's recommended transfer to a less restrictive setting is through \nState law and State Court Rules. See N.J. Stat. Ann. §§ 3B:12-1 et seq.; N.J. Court Rule 4:86. \n76. The paradigm created by the Olmstead decision dictates that residents of the \nVineland Development Center and their guardians have the benefit of treating professionals' \njudgments regarding the most appropriate place to receive services. Only after they have the \nbenefit of that information are residents and guardians required to oppose or consent to continued \nresidence at the facility or discharge to an alternative setting. \n77. The Defendants have ignored and will continue to ignore Plaintiffs' right to have \ntreating professionals render full and fair judgments as to where Plaintiffs' should receive \nservices most appropriate to their needs. \n78. Likewise, Defendants have ignored and will continue to ignore Plaintiffs' rights, \nas recognized by Olmstead, to oppose discharge from Vineland. \n79. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12134, Defendants are under a constitutional and \nstatutory duty to: \n16 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 17 of 27 PageID: 17\n(a) effectuate the placement of Plaintiffs in the \"most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities,\" a setting that \"enables individuals with disabilities to \ninteract with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.\" \n(28 C.F.R. pt. 35 app. A.); \n(b) not place Plaintiffs in more restrictive or dangerous placements \nthan they currently enjoy; \n(c) effectuate appropriate institutional placement for each Plaintiff; \n(d) propose an ICF/MR certified institutional discharge appropriate for \nthe Plaintiffs only where medically and therapeutically appropriate \nupon an impartial multidisciplinary evaluation; \n(e) ensure that Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' guardians and/or Plaintiffs' \nfamilies understand their right to receive treatment and care at an \nICF/MR certified facility prior to seeking consent to discharge a \nplaintiff from the Center; \n(0 (cid:9) obtain the input and informed consent of Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' \nguardians and/or Plaintiffs' families for such transfers. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nAMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT VIOLATIONS \n80. (cid:9) Plaintiffs' incorporate paragraphs 1 through 79 herein by reference as though \nfully set forth. \n17 \n\n(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 18 of 27 PageID: 18\n81. (cid:9) Because discharges or transfers are being forced on Plaintiffs without their \nconsent, or the consent of their guardians or families, and without appropriate recommendations \nfrom treating professionals, such discharges or transfers violate the Americans with Disabilities \nAct and the Rehabilitation Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 — 12134. \n82. (cid:9) The Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief that the Defendants \nshall not discharge or transfer them from their current residences without meeting the \nrequirements that: \n(a) such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nresidence; \n(b) such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals independently conclude that \nsuch a placement is in the best interests of each Plaintiff and is the most \nappropriate setting to meet their needs; and \n(c) the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge \nor transfer. \n83. (cid:9) Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a) directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared \nby Plaintiffs' respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants' mandate to close Vineland Developmental Center, and \ndocumented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIndividual Habilitation Plans at the Vineland Developmental Center). \n(b) Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n18 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 19 of 27 PageID: 19\n(i) to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary \nevaluation; and \n(ii) to receive treatment in accordance with the independent \nrecommendations of the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at the \nVineland Developmental Center, another state operated ICF/MR \nfacility, or non-ICF/MR certified setting, as the plaintiff deems \nappropriate. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nREHABILITATION ACT VIOLATIONS \n84. Plaintiffs' incorporate paragraphs 1 through 83 herein by reference as though \nfully set forth. \n85. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that Injo otherwise qualified person \nwith disabilities shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nfederal financial assistance.\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n86. Each Named Plaintiff and class member is a \"qualified person with disabilities\" \nwithin the meaning of Section 504, because they (1) have physical and/or mental impairments \nthat substantially limit one or more major life activities; and (2) meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for long term care under New Jersey's Medicaid program and are thus \"qualified.\" \n87. Regulations implementing Section 504 require that a public entity administer its \nservices, programs and activities in \"the most integrated setting appropriate\" to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities. 28 CFR § 41.51(d). \n19 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 20 of 27 PageID: 20\n88. (cid:9) Section 504's regulations prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from \nutilizing criteria or methods of administration: \n(a) that have the effect of subjecting Qualified handicapped persons to \ndiscrimination on the basis of handicap [or] \n(b) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing \naccomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program with respect \nto handicapped persons. \n89. Defendants have required that Plaintiffs be discharged or transferred from \nVineland Developmental Center to other settings in violation of Section 504's integration \nmandate. \n90. Further, Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration that \nsubject Plaintiffs and class members to discrimination on the basis of disability, by (1) failing to \nassess properly the services and supports that would enable Plaintiffs to receive services and \ntreatment in the most appropriate settings for their needs, (2) failing to develop proper \nindividualized transition plans, (3) failing to allow guardians to be a part of the planning process, \n(4) failing to inform Plaintiffs of all of their options for receiving services, and (5) allocating \nresources for non-ICF/MR care contrary to the desires and needs of people with disabilities. \n91. The Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief that the Defendants \nshall not discharge or transfer them from their current residences without meeting the \nrequirements that: \n(a) (cid:9) such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n20 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 21 of 27 PageID: 21\n(b) such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals conclude that such a \nplacement is in the best interests of the individual Plaintiffs and is most \nappropriate to meet their needs; and \n(c) the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge \nor transfer. \n92. (cid:9) Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a) directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared \nby Plaintiffs' respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants' mandate to close Vineland Developmental Center, and \ndocumented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIndividual Habilitation Plans at the Vineland Developmental Center). \n(b) Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \nto accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary \nevaluation; and \nto receive treatment in accordance with the independent \nrecommendations of the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at the \nVineland Developmental Center, another state operated ICF/MR \nfacility, or non-ICF/MR certified setting, as the plaintiff deems \nappropriate. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nMEDICAID ACT VIOLATIONS \n21 \n\n(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 22 of 27 PageID: 22\n93. (cid:9) Plaintiffs' incorporate paragraphs 1 through 92 herein by reference as though \nfully set forth. \n94. (cid:9) The State of New Jersey has voluntarily assumed certain obligations under federal \nlaw in return for federal funding under the Medical Assistance Program authorized by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396, et seq. \n95. (cid:9) Those obligations include: \n(a) choice of an ICF/MR institutional placement, subject to a hearing, under \n42 U.S.C. § 1396n and 42 CFR § 441.302(d); \n(b) provision of ICF/MR services under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10) and \n1396d(a)(15); \n(c) competent evaluation for placement in an institutional ICF/MR facility \nunder 42 CFR § 483.440(b)(3); \n(d) a continuous active treatment program as defined in 42 CFR § \n483.440(a)(1). \n96. (cid:9) All Plaintiffs receive assistance under the Medical Assistance Program and are \nowed the duties stated in the preceding paragraph. \n97. (cid:9) Defendants have an obligation to ensure that Plaintiffs' needs and preferences are \nbeing met in their multidisciplinary plan. \n98. (cid:9) Defendants have failed to ensure that Plaintiffs' needs and preferences are being \nmet in their multidisciplinary plan. \n99. (cid:9) Defendants are violating their duties to Plaintiffs under the Medical Assistance \nProgram by their acts and omissions alleged above. \n100. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief as to the following: \n22 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 23 of 27 PageID: 23\n(a) such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n(b) such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals conclude that such a \nplacement is in the best interests of the individual Plaintiffs and most \nappropriate to meet their needs; and \n(c) the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge \nor transfer. \n101.

At all relevant times, a \"special relationship\" existed between each of the \nPlaintiffs and the state and state actors that were responsible for their safety. \n106. Defendants, while acting under color of state law, unlawfully, intentionally, \nunreasonably, maliciously and with deliberate and/or reckless indifference to the Plaintiffs' \nsubstantive and procedural due process rights secured to Plaintiffs under the Fourth and/or \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 et. \nseq. and similar provisions of federal, state and/or local law as alleged herein and as follows. \n107. The Plaintiffs have significant mental and behavioral health issues. They are \nunable to verbally articulate their medical and personal needs. Most of them have very limited \nmobility, and some have none. They are unable to care for themselves in even the most basic \nways. They are at the mercy of the persons who provide them with care. Without the regulatory \nguarantees provided by an ICF/MR facility, they are defenseless against many forms of abuse \nand neglect which can lead to their injury or death. \n108. Before becoming residents at Vineland, some Plaintiffs were abused and \nneglected in the same types of settings Defendants intend to force Plaintiffs into now. \n24 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 25 of 27 PageID: 25\n109. Defendants know or should know that placing the Plaintiffs in other settings, \nincluding non-ICF/MR settings will substantially increase their likelihood of injury and death \nfrom abuse, neglect, error, lack of appropriate services, and other causes. \n110. Defendants' failure to provide adequate safeguards to prevent such harm, and \nDefendants' failure to provide adequate procedures to consider the interests and wishes of the \nPlaintiffs before services are diminished or denied, is a violation of Plaintiffs' constitutional right \nnot to be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law. \n111. The actions of the Defendants herein have significantly contributed to and \nincreased the vulnerability of the Plaintiffs and created an opportunity that would not have \notherwise existed if Defendants complied with their legal duties. \n112. Defendants' actions and inactions constitute a violation of Plaintiffs' federal \nrights, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and \nother federal laws. Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to engage in their \nbehavior, which deprives Plaintiffs of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the \nConstitution of the United States and federal law, and will cause irreparable harm to these \nresidents. \n113. The harm ultimately caused to the Plaintiffs was foreseeable and sufficiently \ndirect. \n114. Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a) (cid:9) such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n25 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 26 of 27 PageID: 26\n(b) such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals conclude that such a \nplacement is in the best interests of the individual Plaintiffs; and \n(c) the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge \nor transfer. \n108. Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a) directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared \nby Plaintiffs' respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants' mandate to close Vineland Developmental Center, and \ndocumented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIndividual Habilitation Plans at the Vineland Developmental Center). \n(b) Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n(0 (cid:9) to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary \nevaluation; and \n(ii) (cid:9) to receive treatment in accordance with the independent \nrecommendations of the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at the \nVineland Developmental Center, another state operated ICF/MR \nfacility, or non-ICF/MR certified setting, as the Plaintiff deems \nappropriate. \nCONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE Plaintiffs seek: \n(a) (cid:9) Declaratory and injunctive relief as set forth herein. \n26 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 1   Filed 04/27/12   Page 27 of 27 PageID: 27\n(b) An award to Plaintiffs' of reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, \nand costs; and \n(c) Any other relief this Court deems just and proper. \nJURY DEMAND  \nPlaintiffs demand a trial by jury. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Thomas A.

Defendant CHRISTOPHER CHRISTIE is the Governor of the State of New \nJersey.  Governor Christie is sued in his official capacity only. \n12.  Defendant NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES (\"DHS\") is \na public entity covered by Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1). \nIt receives federal funds under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  DHS \nadministers services for more than one million of New Jersey's citizens, including individuals \nand families with low incomes; people with mental illnesses, developmental disabilities, or late-\nonset disabilities; people who are blind, visually impaired, deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf-blind; \nparents needing child care services, child support and healthcare for children; and families with \ncatastrophic medical expenses for their children.  DHS is the largest agency in New Jersey. \nDHS operates eight divisions including the Division of Developmental Disabilities. \n13.

The division was created in response to the \nneed for better and more effective services for state residents with developmental disabilities. \n15.  Defendant DAWN APGAR is Deputy Commissioner/Acting Assistant \nCommissioner of the New Jersey Department of Human Services Division of Developmental \nDisabilities.  Ms. Apgar is sued in her official capacity.  Defendant Apgar operates New \nJersey's system of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and is ultimately \nresponsible for ensuring that eligible New Jersey residents with developmental disabilities \nreceive services and supports effectively and in accordance with the United States Constitution, \nthe ADA, the ADA implementing regulations, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as \namended, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and section 504's implementing regulations. \n16.  Defendant VINELAND DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER is a residential facility \nthat provides, among other things, habilitation, behavioral, and medical services and supports \nfor women with developmental disabilities.

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), the Named Plaintiffs bring this action \non behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. \n19.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to the Civil Rights Act, 42 USC § 1983; the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 USC § 12132; § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC § \n794 (\"Section 504\"), and the waiver of state sovereign immunity enacted in 42 USC § 2000d-\n7(a)( 1), various Medicaid federal statutes, and regulations incorporated into New Jersey law and \nthe United States Constitution, on behalf of a Class consisting of themselves and all other \npersons who are residents of the Vineland Developmental Center, Cumberland County, New \nJersey, as of April 25, 2010. \n20.  The proposed class consists of:  New Jersey residents who reside or resided at the \nVineland Developmental Center, at anytime since April 25, 2010, or at any time during this \nlitigation. \n21.  Joinder of the entire Class is impracticable because the Class Members are \nnumerous, and are persons with severe or profound developmental disabilities.  Virtually all \nClass Members are unable to give their consent except through guardians or family members. \n22.  Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims asserted on behalf of the Class. \n23.  Plaintiffs do not have any interests that are adverse or antagonistic to any claims \nor potential claims of the Class. \n24.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members ofthe \nClass. \n25.  Plaintiffs are committed to the vigorous prosecution of this action and have \nretained counsel competent and experienced in this type of litigation. \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 7 of 32 PageID: 173\n26.  Plaintiffs do not seek monetary damages.  Hence, the burden and expense of \nprosecuting this litigation makes it unlikely that members of the Class would or could prosecute \nindividual actions.  If individual actions were pursued by Class Members, prosecution of those \nindividual claims would be impracticable and inefficient. \n27.  Plaintiffs are not aware of any other pending litigation concerning the claims \nherein. \n28.  This Court is the most appropriate forum for adjudicating the claims at issue, \nwhich arise under federal law. \n29.  Plaintiffs do not anticipate any difficulty in the management of this action as a \nclass action. \n30.  There are many questions of law and fact common to the Class, which \npredominate over any questions which may affect individual members.  The predominant \ncommon questions of law and fact include, among others: \n(a)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of the Civil Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983; \n(b)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; \n(c)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of § 504 ofthe Rehabilitation \nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"Section 504\"), and the waiver of state sovereign \nimmunity enacted in 42 U.S.c. § 2000d-7(a)(l); \n(d)  Whether Defendants are liable for violation of various Medicaid federal \nstatutes and regulations incorporated into New Jersey law; \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 8 of 32 PageID: 174\n(e)  Whether Defendants are liable for violations of the United States \nConstitution; and \n(f)  Whether named Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to equitable and \ninjunctive relief. \n31.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. \n32.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and expenses as \npermitted by law, on behalf ofthemselves and the Class. \nCOMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS. \n33.  All Plaintiffs reside at the Vineland Developmental Center or resided there as of \nApril 25, 2010. \n34.  All ofthe residents of Vineland Developmental Center are females.  Almost all of \nVineland's residents have lived in their homes at the Vineland Developmental Center for many \nyears, with 68 percent of those residents having lived there for more than 30 years. \n35.  The Vineland Developmental Center is an Intermediate Care Facility for \nIndividuals with Intellectual Disabilities that is operated by the State of New Jersey.  It is \nlicensed to serve 556 residents, and currently serves approximately 347 individuals. \n36.  An Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual \nDisabilities(\"ICF/IID\") (formerly referred to as an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally \nRetarded or \"ICF/MR\") is regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(\"CMS\") in conjunction with the state's licensing agency.  Part of that regulatory process \nincludes routine surveys by CMS and the state's licensing agency to ensure quality treatment and \nservices are provided by ICF/IID-certified facilities, like Vineland Developmental Center. \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 9 of 32 PageID: 175\n37.  Eligibility for residence in a New Jersey developmental center is defined by \nSection 1.3 of Division Circular #3, N.J.A.C. 10:46-1.3, effective March 24,2011.  That \nregulation defines the developmental disability that must be present in order to receive services \nas a severe, chronic disability of an individual, which is attributable to a mental impairment, \nphysical impairment, or combination of both; is manifested before age 22; is likely to continue \nindefinitely; results in a combination of functional limitations in major life activities; reflects the \nneed for a combination of special interdisciplinary care or treatment of lifelong or extended \nduration; and includes, but is not limited to, developmental disabilities, autism, cerebral palsy, \nepilepsy, spina bifida, and other neurological impairments. \n38.  All Plaintiffs are diagnosed as in need of state-run rCF/IID institutional care and \nhave been appropriately designated as eligible for state-operated rCF/IID-level of care. \n39.  Eighty-six (86) percent of the individuals residing at the Vineland Developmental \nCenter have been diagnosed with profound or severe intellectual disabilities.  Approximately \nthirteen (13) percent of individuals residing at the Vineland Developmental Center have been \nassessed with a diagnosis of mild or moderate levels of intellectual disability.  Almost all \nindividuals residing at the Vineland Developmental Center (hereinafter referred to as \"Vineland\" \nor \"VDC\") have been diagnosed with additional disabilities, including: Sixty-five (65) percent of \nthe population diagnosed with seizure disorders, seventeen (17) percent diagnosed with autism, \nand twenty-eight (28) percent diagnosed with cerebral palsy.  rn addition, forty-six (46) percent \nhave vision difficulties, and twelve (12) percent have hearing impairments. \n40.  The primary service needs of individuals at Vineland require a variety of services \nand supports. Some broad areas of service are described below, along with the number of \nindividuals for whom that service is their primary need: \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 10 of 32 PageID: 176\n(a)  Extensive Personal Care - Approximately three hundred (300) VDC \nindividuals require extensive personal care.  This need refers to people \nwho require total assistance and care provided by direct service staff who \nare specially trained on individualized programs developed by residents' \ntreating professionals, including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, \noccupational therapists, speech language pathologists, and many other \nlicensed clinicians who treat residents at the Center. \n(b)  Significant Health Care Services -Treating professionals at Vineland have \ndetermined that significant nursing intervention and monitoring are \nrequired to effectively treat about seventy (70) Vineland residents, who \nhave significant health care needs.  This service includes the need for 24-\nhour monitoring and immediate availability of treating professionals for \nintermittent pressure breathing, inhalation assistive devices, tracheotomy \ncare, or treatment for recurrent pneumonias or apnea. \n(c)  Ambulation -Approximately thirty-seven (37) percent of Vineland \nresidents are non-ambulatory or require assistance with ambulation. \n(d)  Significant Behavioral Support - Approximately sixty-three (63) \nindividuals residing at Vineland require significant behavioral support. \nThis need addresses individuals who have behaviors that require \nintervention for the safety of themselves or others, as developed by \npsychologists and medical personnel and implemented in conjunction with \ndirect service staff. \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 11 of 32 PageID: 177\n41.  Prior to 2010, all Vineland residents were consistently evaluated by their treating \nprofessionals and determined to be in need ofICF/IID services and that the best setting for \nPlaintiffs to receive those services was at the Vineland Developmental Center.  Subsequent to \nDefendants' announcement of an intent to close the Vineland Developmental Center, treating \nprofessionals often have routinely and inappropriately stated that Plaintiffs would best be served \nin alternative settings, including settings that do not provide ICF/IID-level of care.  Most of these \nstatements supporting placement in the \"community\" were not based upon sound and unbiased \nprofessional judgments consistent with accepted professional standards. \n42.  For a significant period of time from 2010 to 2012, the Defendants openly stated \ntheir intent to close Vineland, and in fact greatly downsized Vineland by closing one (1) of its \ntwo (2) campuses.  Even though the official focus appears to have shifted to the closure of two \n(2) other developmental centers, North Jersey Developmental Center and Woodbridge \nDevelopmental Center, the treating professionals at Vineland continue to make routine and \ninappropriate recommendations for placements outside of Vineland due to the illegal and \nunsound policies and practices of the Defendants encouraging the downsizing or closure of \ndevelopmental centers. \n43.  All Plaintiffs have the right to receive ICF/IID-level of services from the State of \nNew Jersey. \n44.  All Plaintiffs have had or imminently will have their rights to receive ICF/IID-\nlevel services at the Vineland Developmental Center denied.  The policies and practices of the \nState will deceive, frighten, and coerce residents of Vineland into inappropriately surrendering \ntheir rights to receive this superior level of care.  Also, the loss of professionals and other staff at \nVineland, due to a perceived lack ofj ob security, and the loss of some services at Vineland due \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 12 of 32 PageID: 178\nto its downsizing and the underlying plan to close all Developmental Centers, will result in \ninferior care in violation of Plaintiffs' rights and will ultimately inappropriately force residents to \nleave Vineland. \n45.  Defendants seek to compel Plaintiffs' discharge from Vineland Developmental \nCenter to other settings, including non-ICF/IID-certified settings.  The decision to not officially \ntarget Vineland for closure at this time, while two (2) other Developmental Centers are officially \ntargeted, does not stop the overall statewide effort to downsize and close all the Developmental \nCenters.  The State will continuie to inappropriately, unfairly, and illegally downsize the current \nVineland population to make room for residents from facilities that are targeted immediately for \nclosure and to eventually close Vineland.  The State has not given any promise for how long \nVineland will remain open, which betrays their true intent in the longer term. \n46.  Defendants' policies and procedures have interfered with or usurped the ability of \nPlaintiffs' treating professionals to make independent and sound professional judgments.  The \ntreating professionals are now often following a political or administrative agenda rather than \naccepted professional standards. \n47.  Defendants' policies and procedures have unduly influenced or compelled \nPlaintiffs' treating professionals to recommend transfer or discharge of Plaintiffs to settings that \nare not the most appropriate for Plaintiffs' needs, solely for the purpose of conforming to \nDefendants' political policy decisions. \n48.  All Plaintiffs are medically and developmentally most appropriately served at the \nVineland Developmental Center instead of any alternative setting. \n49.  All Plaintiffs are physically, mentally, and emotionally fragile and are most \nappropriately served at the Vineland Developmental Center instead of any alternative setting. \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 13 of 32 PageID: 179\n50.  All Plaintiffs are in need of continuous care by multidisciplinary teams of \nprofessionals as are currently serving them at the Vineland Developmental Center. \n51.  The services provided to Plaintiffs cannot be reasonably replicated in alternative \nresidential settings. \n52.  Non-ICF/IID-certified settings are not able to reasonably provide the same level \nof care as an ICF/IID-certified facility. \n53.  Services provided to residents at the Vineland Developmental Center are uniquely \ntailored to the needs ofthe residents of that Center. \n54.  None of the Plaintiffs have given informed consent for their discharge from \nVineland Developmental Center because, among other things, Defendants have precluded \ntreating professionals at the Vineland Developmental Center from fully and fairly considering \nwhether Vineland best meets the needs of the Plaintiffs, and have prevented those treating \nprofessionals from acknowledging the rights of Plaintiffs to receive treatment and services at \nVineland Developmental Center or in another ICFIIID. \n55.  Plaintiffs have not had the benefit of their respective treating professionals' \nindependent judgment about whether they should continue to reside at Vineland Developmental \nCenter or at another state-operated I CF IIID. \n56.  Defendants have or will unduly influence or compel Plaintiffs to receive services \nin non-ICF/IID facilities.  Those services are inferior to the services provided at Vineland \nDevelopmental Center because, among other reasons, they will not be provided by an \nindividualized, multidisciplinary team of professionals. \n57.  Persons residing in the type of settings to which Defendants intend to discharge \nPlaintiffs, are at approximately seventy-five (75) percent greater risk of death, abuse, and neglect \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 14 of 32 PageID: 180\nas compared to similar persons receiving services at a facility like Vineland Developmental \nCenter. \n58.  Defendants know or should know of the increased danger of death, abuse, and \nneglect to which Plaintiffs will be subjected ifthey are discharged from Vineland, as sought by \nDefendants' political plan to downsize or close all the Developmental Centers. \n59.  Persons residing in the type of \"community\" settings to which Defendants intend \nto discharge Plaintiffs are likely to be more secluded from the community immediately \nsurrounding them and be more restricted in their interactions with non-disabled peers as \ncompared to similar persons receiving services at a facility like Vineland Developmental Center. \n60.  In May 2011, Defendants announced their plan to \"depopulate\" and close the \nVineland Developmental Center and discharge residents to non-ICF-IID-certified alternative \nsettings.  The plan was to move the residents to \"community\" settings such as small group \nhomes, nursing homes, and other settings with smaller populations where they would allegedly \nhave more interactions with the non-disabled population.  In reality, these residents may actually \nbe more isolated in a small home or apartment than they were at Vineland, as Vineland is open to \ncommunity events and has opportunities for cOJ;nmunity involvement. \n61.  Among the reasons identified by Defendants for their \"depopulation\" plan was the \nostensibly high cost of providing the necessary services for the disabled residents of the State's \ndevelopmental centers. \n62.  As part of that plan, Defendants also announced that they would close the West \nCampus ofthe Vineland Developmental Center.  Defendants have taken significant steps in that \nplan, including the closing of the West Campus.  The Defendants have transferred and \ndischarged residents without adequate transition plans, without guardian or residents' full and \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 15 of 32 PageID: 181\nfair participation, without treating professionals' independent and sound assessments, without \nregard for residents' specific individual needs and desires, and without regard for the rights of \nresidents.  Because of continuing arbitrary and inappropriate recommendations by treating \nprofessionals that residents of Vineland can be and should be served in the \"community,\" the \nremaining residents remain at great risk of being improperly and detrimentally transferred out of \nVineland. \n63.  The identity and circumstances of all adversely impacted former and current \nresidents can only be obtained through appropriate discovery in this case, including the names \nand contact information of all members of the proposed class. \n64.  Contrary to Defendants' public statements about the alleged general desire for \n\"community\" placements, Plaintiffs have not requested discharge or transition from Vineland \nDevelopmental Center. \n65.  Defendants have instructed or inappropriately encouraged Plaintiffs' treating \nprofessionals to include language in Plaintiffs' individual habilitation plans indicating that \nPlaintiffs are capable of being served in settings other than Vineland Developmental Center, \nregardless of whether Plaintiffs are actually capable of being served in alternative settings. \n66.  Defendants have instructed or inappropriately encouraged Plaintiffs' treating \nprofessionals to include language in Plaintiffs' individual habilitation plans indicating that \nPlaintiffs have requested discharge to settings other than Vineland Developmental Center, \nregardless of whether Plaintiffs actually communicated such a request. \n67.  These treating professionals are likely intimidated and fearful of retaliation, \nincluding the possible loss of their jobs, and likely will only be forthcoming with information to \n15 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 16 of 32 PageID: 182\nsupport the position of Plaintiffs if protected by or compelled by appropriate discovery in this \ncase. \n68.  Because Plaintiffs' treating professionals have not been able to provide \nindependent judgments about Plaintiffs' ability to be comparatively served in alternative settings, \nthe judgments they have made in that regard are largely unreliable and inaccurate. \n69.  Many of the Plaintiffs have not been provided sufficient information to allow \nthem to provide informed consent to discharge. \n70.  Defendants made the decision to downsize or depopulate the Vineland \nDevelopmental Center without regard to the needs of the individual Plaintiffs, their individual \nsupport plans (which are developed in conjunction with their treating professionals), or their \nrights to receive services in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs. \n71.  On December 14,2011, the New Jersey Legislature enacted a statute which \nincluded the creation of a task force to evaluate the state's seven developmental centers and to \nissue binding and non-binding recommendations to the Department of Ruman Services (\"DRS\") \nwith respect to closure of one or more of the centers.  Senate No. 2928, Chapter 143 P.L. 2011. \n72.  On August 1,2012, the \"Task Force on the Closure of State Developmental \nCenters\" (\"task force\") issued a \"Final Report As Submitted to Governor Chris Christie and the \nNew Jersey Legislature\" (\"Final Report\"). \n73.  The Task Force's allegedly binding recommendation as contained in the Final \nReport instructed DRS \"to develop and implement a plan to close North Jersey Developmental \nCenter followed by Woodbridge Developmental Center within the next five years .... \"  Id. at 8. \n74.  While the Final Report contains language regarding the needs of the residents, \nsuch language is largely rendered meaningless by the Task Force's presumption that the two \n16 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 17 of 32 PageID: 183\nfacilities must be closed, and that residents must be discharged to achieve its binding \nrecommendation and to achieve the political agenda of the State.  Similarly, although Vineland is \nnot an official and immediate target for closure, there is an underlying presumption by the State, \nas evidenced by its policies and practices, that Vineland must ultimately close.  The needs of the \nresidents of Vineland should be the primary concern of the State, but instead the State gives \npriority to its political agenda. \n75.  The Task Force's recommendations and the State's actions to discharge residents \nto comply with the recommendations of closure elude meaningful evaluation and consideration \nof treatment team professionals regarding most integrated residential settings and alternative \nsettings which can serve the needs of such residents. \n76.  The Task Force rendered opinions and recommendations based on faulty data. \n77.  Residents of the State's developmental centers, those recommended for closure \nand those not recommended for closure, have the right to receive recommendations from their \nrespective treating professionals regarding the most appropriate setting to meet the needs of such \nresidents. \n78.  The Task Force's mandate to close two developmental centers without \nmeaningful evaluation of the residents' needs further evidences that the residents of the \ndevelopmental centers have not received treating professionals' recommendations without \nunreasonable interference or influence from the State's policies, procedures and agendas. \n79.  Despite the publicly announced targeting for closure of two (2) other \nDevelopmental Centers, the inappropriate conduct of the Defendants has continued as to \nVineland residents.  In fact, it is believed that the Defendants still support policies and practices \nthat encourage the downsizing or closure of all Developmental Centers.  Furthermore, there will \n17 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 18 of 32 PageID: 184\nbe continuing pressure by the Defendants to move residents out of Vineland to make room for \nresidents from North Jersey Developmental Center (hereinafter referred to as \"North Jersey\") \nand Woodbridge Developmental Center (hereinafter referred to as \"Woodbridge\"), so that the \narbitrary and unreasonable closure deadlines can be met. \n80.  The announced targeting of North Jersey and Woodbridge for closure has not \nstopped the violation of Plaintiffs rights at Vineland. \n81.  The Plaintiffs' causes of action are not based upon, reliant upon, or adversely \nimpacted by any recommendation or finding by the Task Force.  The allegedly binding \nrecommendations ofthe Task Force are merely further evidence of an overall plan to downsize \nand eventually close all developmental centers in the State of New Jersey. \n82.  Plaintiffs who have already been discharged from Vineland Developmental \nCenter are being denied access to a similar level of treatment and services they received at the \nVineland Developmental Center. \n83.  Plaintiffs currently residing at Vineland Developmental Center will be denied \naccess to their current high level of treatment and services if the Defendants continue with their \ncurrent plan to discharge residents. \nCOMMON ALLEGATIONS OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES. \n84.  As described more fully herein, each Plaintiff has a constitutional right, a life and \nliberty interest in, and a statutory entitlement to receive treatment and services from the State of \nNew Jersey in the most appropriate setting for his or her needs. \n85.  Interpreting the ADA and the Department of Justice's regulations issued under it, \nthe Supreme Court decision in Olmstead emphasized that there is no \"federal requirement that \n18 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 19 of 32 PageID: 185\ncommunity-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.\" Olmstead v. Zimring, \net aI., 527 U.S. 581,602 (1999).  The Olmstead Court further stressed that \"nothing in the ADA \nor its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable \nto handle or benefit from community settings.\" Id. at 601-02. \"[T]he ADA is not reasonably read \nto impel States to phase out institutions, placing patients in need of close care at risk.\" Id. at 605. \n86.  In fact, the Olmstead decision recognized that \"for [some] individuals, no \nplacement outside the institution may ever be appropriate.\" Id. (citing and quoting Brief for \nAmerican Psychiatric Association et ai. as Amici Curiae at 22-23 (\"Some individuals, whether \nmentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times-perhaps in the short run, \nperhaps in the long run-for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of \ncommunity settings\"); Brief for Voice of the Retarded et al. as Amici Curiae at 11 (\"Each \ndisabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that person-\nrecognizing that, on a case-by-case basis, that setting may be in an institution\"); Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307,327 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (\"For many mentally retarded \npeople, the difference between the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution and \ntotal dependence on the institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will \nknow\"). \n87.  By virtue of the ADA and the Olmstead decision, Plaintiffs have a federally-\nprotected right to receive recommendations from treating professionals as to whether community \nplacement is the most appropriate to their needs and to fair consideration of their opposition to \nthat transfer, even if the proposed transfer is from institutional care to an allegedly less restrictive \nsetting.  The only proper mechanism for second-guessing an individual or guardian's decision to \n19 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 20 of 32 PageID: 186\noppose a treating professional's recommended transfer to a less restrictive setting is through \nState law and State Court Rules. See N.J. Stat. Ann. §§ 3B: 12-1 et seq.; N.J. Court Rule 4:86. \n88.  The paradigm created by the Olmstead decision dictates that residents of the \nVineland Development Center and their guardians have the benefit oftreating professionals' \njudgments regarding the most appropriate place to receive services.  Only after they have the \nbenefit of that information are residents and guardians required to oppose or consent to continued \nresidence at the facility or discharge to an alternative setting. \n89.  The Defendants have ignored and will continue to ignore Plaintiffs' right to have \ntreating professionals render full and fair judgments as to where Plaintiffs' should receive \nservices most appropriate to their needs. \n90.  Likewise, Defendants have ignored and will continue to ignore Plaintiffs' rights, \nas recognized by Olmstead, to oppose discharge from Vineland. \n91.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 12134, Defendants are under a constitutional and \nstatutory duty to: \n(a)  effectuate the placement of Plaintiffs in the \"most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities,\" a setting that \"enables individuals with disabilities to \ninteract with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible.\" \n(28 C.F.R. pt. 35 app. A.); \n(b)  not place Plaintiffs in more restrictive or dangerous placements \nthan they currently enjoy; \n(c)  effectuate appropriate institutional placement for each Plaintiff; \n20 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 21 of 32 PageID: 187\n(d)  propose an ICF/IID-certified institutional discharge appropriate for \nthe Plaintiffs only where medically and therapeutically appropriate \nupon an impartial multidisciplinary evaluation; \n( e)   ensure that Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' guardians and/or Plaintiffs' \nfamilies understand their right to receive treatment and care at an \nICF/IID-certified facility prior to seeking consent to discharge a \nplaintiff from the Center; \n(f)  obtain the input and informed consent of Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' \nguardians and/or Plaintiffs' families for such transfers. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nAMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT VIOLATIONS \n92.  Plaintiffs' incorporate paragraphs one (1) through ninety (91) herein by reference \nas though fully set forth. \n93.  Because discharges or transfers are being forced on Plaintiffs without their \nconsent, or the consent of their guardians or families, and without appropriate recommendations \nfrom treating professionals, such discharges or transfers violate the Americans with Disabilities \nAct and the Rehabilitation Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 - 12134. \n94.  The Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief that the Defendants \nshall not discharge or transfer them from their current residences without meeting the \nrequirements that: \n21 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 22 of 32 PageID: 188\n(a)  such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nresidence; \n(b)  such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals independently conclude that \nsuch a placement is in the best interests of each Plaintiff and is the most \nappropriate setting to meet their needs; and \n(c)  the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge \nor transfer. \n95.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a)  directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared \nby Plaintiffs' respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants' mandate to downsize or close any developmental centers, and \ndocumented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIndividual Habilitation Plans at the Vineland Developmental Center). \n(b)  Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation ofthe multidisciplinary \nevaluation; and \n(ii)  to receive treatment in accordance with the independent \nrecommendations of the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at the \nVineland Developmental Center, another state operated ICFIIID \nfacility, or non-ICFIIID certified setting, as the plaintiff deems \nappropriate. \n22 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 23 of 32 PageID: 189\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nREHABILITATION ACT VIOLATIONS \n96.  Plaintiffs' incorporate paragraphs one (1) through ninety-four (9S) herein by \nreference as though fully set forth. \n97.  Section S04 of the Rehabilitation Act states that \"[n]o otherwise qualified person \nwith disabilities shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nfederal financial assistance.\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n98.  Each named Plaintiff and class member is a \"qualified person with disabilities\" \nwithin the meaning of Section S04, because they (1) have physical and/or mental impairments \nthat substantially limit one or more major life activities; and (2) meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for long term care under New Jersey's Medicaid program and are thus \"qualified.\" \n99.  Regulations implementing Section S04 require that a public entity administer its \nservices, programs and activities in \"the most integrated setting appropriate\" to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities. 28 CFR § 41.S1 (d). \n100.  Section S04's regulations prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from \nutilizing criteria or methods of administration: \n(a)  that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to \ndiscrimination on the basis of handicap [o r] \n(b)  that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing \naccomplishment ofthe objectives of the recipient's program with respect \nto handicapped persons. \n23 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 24 of 32 PageID: 190\n101.  Defendants have required that Plaintiffs be discharged or transferred from \nVineland Developmental Center to other settings in violation of Section 504's integration \nmandate. \n102.  Further, Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration that \nsubject Plaintiffs and class members to discrimination on the basis of disability, by (1) failing to \nassess properly the services and supports that would enable Plaintiffs to receive services and \ntreatment in the most appropriate settings for their needs, (2) failing to develop proper \nindividualized transition plans, (3) failing to allow guardians to be a part of the planning process, \n(4) failing to inform Plaintiffs of all of their options for receiving services, and (5) allocating \nresources for non-rCF/IID care contrary to the desires and needs of people with disabilities. \n103.  The Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief that the Defendants \nshall not discharge or transfer them from their current residences without meeting the \nrequirements that: \n(a)  such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n(b)  such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals conclude that such a \nplacement is in the best interests of the individual Plaintiffs and is most \nappropriate to meet their needs; and \n(c)  the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge \nor transfer. \n104.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n24 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 25 of 32 PageID: 191\n(a)  directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared \nby Plaintiffs' respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants' mandate to downsize or close any Developmental Centers, \nand documented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known \nas Individual Habilitation Plans at the Vineland Developmental Center). \n(b)  Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary \nevaluation; and \n(ii)  to receive treatment in accordance with the independent \nrecommendations of the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at the \nVineland Developmental Center, another state-operated ICF/IID \nfacility, or non-ICF/IID certified setting, as the Plaintiff deems \nappropriate. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nMEDICAID ACT VIOLATIONS \n105.  Plaintiffs' incorporate paragraphs one (1) through one hundred three (104) herein \nby reference as though fully set forth. \n106.  The State of New Jersey has voluntarily assumed certain obligations under federal \nlaw in return for federal funding under the Medical Assistance Program authorized by 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396, et seq. \n107.  Those obligations include: \n25 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 26 of 32 PageID: 192\n(a)  choice of an ICF/IID institutional placement, subject to a hearing, under \n42 U.S.c. § 1396n and 42 CFR § 441.302(d); \n(b)  provision ofICF/IID services under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10) and \n1396d(a)(l5); \n(c)  competent evaluation for placement in an institutional ICF/IID facility \nunder 42 CFR § 483.440(b)(3); \n(d)  a continuous active treatment program as defined in 42 CFR § \n483.440(a)(1). \n108.  All Plaintiffs receive assistance under the Medical Assistance Program and are \nowed the duties stated in the preceding paragraph. \n109.  Defendants have an obligation to ensure that Plaintiffs' needs and preferences are \nbeing met in their multidisciplinary plan. \n110.  Defendants have failed to ensure that Plaintiffs' needs and preferences are being \nmet in their multidisciplinary plan. \n111.  Defendants are violating their duties to Plaintiffs under the Medical Assistance \nProgram by their acts and omissions alleged above. \n112.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief as to the following: \n(a)  such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n(b)  such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals conclude that such a \n26 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 27 of 32 PageID: 193\nplacement is in the best interests of the individual Plaintiffs and most \nappropriate to meet their needs; and \n(c)  the Plaintiffs by their guardians or families wish to effect such discharge \nor transfer. \n113.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a)  directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared \nby Plaintiffs' respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants' mandate to downsize or close any developmental centers, and \ndocumented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIndividual Habilitation Plans at the Vineland Developmental Center). \n(b)  Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation of the multidisciplinary \nevaluation; and \n(ii)  to receive treatment in accordance with the independent \nrecommendations of the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at the \nVineland Developmental Center, another state operated ICP/lID, \nor non-ICP/lID certified setting, as the Plaintiff deems appropriate. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nCONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS \n114.  Plaintiffs' incorporate paragraphs one (1) through one hundred twelve (113) \nherein by reference as though fully set forth. \n115.  At all relevant times, Defendants were \"persons\" under 42 U.S.c. § 1983. \n27 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 28 of 32 PageID: 194\n116.  At all relevant times, Defendants were acting \"under color of state law\" under 42 \nU.S.c. § 1983. \n117.  At all relevant times, a \"special relationship\" existed between each of the \nPlaintiffs and the state and state actors that were responsible for their safety. \n118.  Defendants, while acting under color of state law, unlawfully, intentionally, \nunreasonably, maliciously and with deliberate andlor reckless indifference to the Plaintiffs' \nsubstantive due process rights secured to Plaintiffs under the Fourth andlor Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 et. seq. and \nsimilar provisions of federal, state andlor local law, violated Plaintiffs' rights as alleged above \nand as follows. \n119.  The Plaintiffs have significant mental and behavioral health issues.  They are \nunable to verbally articulate their medical and personal needs.  Most of them have very limited \nmobility, and some have none.  They are unable to care for themselves in even the most basic \nways.  They are at the mercy of the persons who provide them with care.  Without the regulatory \nguarantees provided by an ICFIIID facility, they are defenseless against many forms of abuse \nand neglect which can lead to their injury or death. \n120.  Before becoming residents at Vineland, some Plaintiffs were abused and \nneglected in the same types of \"community\" settings Defendants intend to force Plaintiffs into \nnow. \n121.  Defendants know or should know that placing the Plaintiffs in other settings, \nincluding non-ICFIIID settings will substantially increase their likelihood of injury and death \nfrom abuse, neglect, error, lack of appropriate services, and other causes. \n28 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 29 of 32 PageID: 195\n122.  Defendants' failure to provide adequate safeguards to prevent such harm is a \nviolation of Plaintiffs' constitutional right not to be deprived of life or liberty without due \nprocess oflaw. \n123.  The actions of the Defendants herein have significantly contributed to and \nincreased the vulnerability of the Plaintiffs and created risks that would not have otherwise \nexisted if Defendants complied with their legal duties. \n124.  Defendants' actions and inactions constitute a violation of Plaintiffs' federal \nrights, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and \nother federal laws.  Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to engage in their \nmisbehavior, which deprives the Plaintiffs of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the \nConstitution of the United States and federal law, and will cause irreparable harm to these \nresidents. \n125.  The harm ultimately caused or to be caused to the Plaintiffs was or is foreseeable \nand sufficiently direct. \n126.  Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief directing that: \n(a)  such discharge or transfer will not result in Plaintiffs receiving treatment \nand services in a setting more restrictive of their rights than their current \nplacement; \n(b)  such discharge or transfer will not be recommended by treating \nprofessionals unless the treating professionals conclude that such a \nplacement is in the best interests of the individual Plaintiffs; and \n(c)  such discharge or transfer will not occur unless the Plaintiffs, by their \nguardians or families, wish to effect such discharge or transfer. \n29 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 30 of 32 PageID: 196\n127.  Plaintiffs are entitled to the following additional declaratory and injunctive relief: \n(a)  directing Defendants to abide by treatment plans independently prepared \nby Plaintiffs' respective treating professionals, without regard for the \nDefendants' mandate to downsize or close any developmental centers, and \ndocumented in their respective multidisciplinary evaluations (known as \nIndividual Habilitation Plans at the Vineland Developmental Center). \n(b)  Permitting each Plaintiff to choose: \n(i)  to accept or reject the recommendation ofthe multidisciplinary \nevaluation; and \n(ii)  to receive treatment in accordance with the independent \nrecommendations of the multidisciplinary evaluation, either at the \nVineland Developmental Center, another state operated ICF/IID \nfacility, or non-ICF/IID certified setting, as the Plaintiff deems \nappropriate. \nCONCLUSION \nWHEREFORE Plaintiffs seek: \n(a)  Declaratory and injunctive relief as set forth herein. \n(b)  An award to Plaintiffs' of reasonable attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, \nand costs; and \n(c)  Any other relief this Court deems just and proper. \n30 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 30   Filed 01/11/13   Page 31 of 32 PageID: 197\nJURY DEMAND \nPlaintiffs demand a trial by jury. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Thomas A.

In May 2011, the State announced a plan to close\nVineland  to  further  efforts  to  transition  individuals  with\ndevelopmental disabilities to more integrated community settings.\nIn December 2011, however, this plan was halted when the New Jersey\nLegislature  created  the  Task  Force  on  the  Closure  of  State\nDevelopmental Centers.  The Task Force was charged with evaluating\nall State developmental centers to make binding recommendations to\nthe State Legislature for the closure of at least one of these\ninstitutions.  \nIn its final report, which was issued in August 2012, the\nTask Force made binding recommendations to the Department of Human\nServices  to  close  two  developmental  centers,  Woodbridge\nDevelopmental Center and North Jersey Developmental Center, within\nthe  next  five  years.    The  Task  Force  concluded  that  Vineland\nDevelopmental Center should not be closed.  Thus, there are no\nplans to close Vineland Developmental Center at this time.\nIn the amended complaint, Plaintiffs seek to prevent or\nimpose conditions on their discharges from Vineland, should such\ndischarges ever occur.  That is, despite there being no plans to\nclose Vineland or to transfer Plaintiffs to community settings,\n1\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 8 of 40 PageID: 210\nPlaintiffs  ask  the  court  to  issue  an  advisory  opinion  setting\nconditions on Plaintiffs’ theoretical transfers.     \nThe amended complaint should be dismissed because it is\nnot ripe for disposition.  The court should not adjudicate whether\nDefendants must offer Plaintiffs services at Vineland Developmental\nCenter, nor whether any alternate placements Defendants may offer\nPlaintiffs may be appropriate, when Defendants have no plans to\nclose Vineland or to transfer Plaintiffs, and have not offered\nPlaintiffs alternate residential placements.  Indeed, these events\nmay not occur as Plaintiffs predict or may not occur at all.  \nMoreover,  even  if  the  court  decides  to  adjudicate\nPlaintiffs’  claims,  the  complaint  should  be  dismissed  because\nPlaintiffs do not state a cause of action upon which relief can be\ngranted.    First,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  and\nRehabilitation  Act  do  not  prohibit  Defendants  from  offering\nPlaintiffs  services  in  more  integrated  settings,  regardless  of\nPlaintiffs’ preference for care in a particular institution.  These\nstatutes  forbid  discrimination  in  the  form  of  unjustified\ninstitutionalization, and not de-institutionalization.  Second, the\nMedicaid Act does not give Plaintiffs a right to receive services\nat a particular institution, like Vineland Developmental Center,\nbut only allows them to choose an institutional level of services.\nFinally, the court should abstain from hearing Plaintiffs’ due\nprocess  claims  because  Defendants  have  an  administrative  and\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 9 of 40 PageID: 211\njudicial appeal process to judge the appropriateness of offers of\nresidential placement, should such offers ever be made.  The court\nshould defer to this process, rather than attempting to adjudicate\nthe  appropriateness  of  particular  offers  of  placements  to\nparticular individuals in class action litigation.              \n       PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn April 27, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against\nDefendants alleging that their potential transfers from Vineland\nDevelopmental Center would violate the Americans with Disabilities\nAct, the Rehabilitation Act, the Medicaid Act, and the Due Process\nClause of the 14th Amendment.   \nOn May 10, 2012, Plaintiffs sent forms to Defendants\nrequesting that they waive service of the complaint.  Defendants\nexecuted the waiver of service forms, and their time to answer,\nmove or otherwise respond to the complaint was set to expire on\nJuly 9, 2012.   \nOn July 3, 2012, Defendants filed an application for a\nClerk’s extension of the time period to respond to the complaint by\n14 days.  On July 5, 2012, this extension was granted, extending\nthe time to respond to the complaint to July 23, 2012.  \nOn July 13, 2012, Plaintiffs filed a motion for admission\nof Attorney Thomas B. York Pro Hac Vice to represent Plaintiffs in\nthis matter.  On July 26, 2012, the court granted this motion.\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 10 of 40 PageID: 212\nOn July 23, 2012, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss\nPlaintiffs’ complaint.  Plaintiffs filed opposition to this motion\non August 6, 2013.  \nOn  August  10,  2012,  Defendants  filed  a  letter\nsupplementing their motion to dismiss, which explained that the\nTask  Force  on  the  Closure  of  State  Developmental  Centers  made\nbinding recommendations that Woodbridge Developmental Center and\nVineland  Developmental  Center,  and  not  Vineland  Developmental\nCenter, be closed within five years.\nOn September 21, 2012, Plaintiffs filed motions for the\nadmissions of Attorney Cordelia M. Elias and Attorney Donald B.\nZaycosky Pro Hac Vice to represent Plaintiffs in this matter.  On\nOctober 3, 2012, the court granted these motions.\nOn  September  25,  2012,  the  court  administratively\nterminated Defendants’ motion to dismiss for reasons set forth on\nthe record during a September 20, 2012 phone conference.\nBy  Order  dated  December  7,  2012,  the  court  granted\nPlaintiffs leave to file an emended complaint by January 11, 2013.\nOn  January  11,  2013,  Plaintiffs  filed  an  amended\ncomplaint.  \nOn January 24, 2013, Defendants filed an application for\na Clerk’s extension of the time period to respond to the amended\ncomplaint by 14 days.  On January 25, 2013, this extension was\n4\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 11 of 40 PageID: 213\ngranted, extending the time to respond to the complaint to February\n8, 2013. \nDefendants  now  file  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  amended\ncomplaint.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nThe  New  Jersey  Department  of  Human  Services  (DHS),\nDivision of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) provides services to\neligible individuals with developmental disabilities.  N.J.S.A.\n30:6D-23  et  seq.    These  services  include  “care  management,\ndiagnosis,  evaluation,  treatment,  personal  care,  day  care,\ndomiciliary care, special living arrangements, training, education,\nvocational training, recreation, counseling of the person with the\ndisability and his family, information and referral services and\ntransportation services.”  N.J.S.A. 30:6D-25.  \nDDD  provides  both  community-based  and  institutional\nresidential services.1  It operates a Medicaid Home and Community-\nBased Services Waiver (waiver program) to fund residential and\nother services in the community.  See N.J.S.A. 30:6D-42.1.  The\n1  Although  DDD  funds  residential  services,  it  maintains  a\nlengthy waiting list for these services because its resources are\nnot sufficient to meet the needs of the class of beneficiaries.\nSee N.J.A.C. 10:46C-1.1 et seq.; J.D. v. Div. of Developmental\nDisabilities,  329  N.J.  Super.  516,  522  (App.  Div.  2000)(With\ncompeting claims for limited financial resources, DDD “is faced\nwith the daunting and unenviable task of attempting to provide for\na large number of clients with inadequate funding for placement of\nall  those  in  need  of  services.”).    Plaintiffs  are  not  on  the\nwaiting list because they already receive residential services from\nDDD and have not requested a community placement.  \n5\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 12 of 40 PageID: 214\nwaiver program, which is approved by the Center for Medicare and\nMedicaid  Services,  allows  DDD  to  waive  certain  Medicaid  Act\nrequirements to obtain Medicaid funding for home and community\nbased  services,  which  would  otherwise  be  provided  in  an\ninstitution.  42 U.S.C. 1396n(c).  DDD serves the vast majority of\neligible individuals in the community. \nDDD  also  operates  seven  developmental  centers,  which\nprovide  an  institutional  level  of  care.    See  N.J.S.A.  30:1-7.\nPlaintiffs reside and receive services at one of these facilities,\nVineland Developmental Center (Vineland or Vineland Developmental\nCenter).  See Amended Complaint at ¶¶4-10.  \nIn  May  2011,  DDD  announced  a  plan  to  close  Vineland\nDevelopmental Center to further its efforts to transition eligible\nindividuals from institutions to the community.  See Complaint at\n¶60.  These efforts are consistent with the United States Supreme\nCourt’s holding in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 587 (1999), in\nwhich the Court found that, under Title II of the ADA, a State must\ntransition an individual from an institution to the community if\nthe State’s treating professionals have determined that the person\ncan be served in the community and the person does not oppose\ncommunity placement or show justification for why it need not under\nthe ADA “fundamental alterations” provisions. \nOn December 14, 2011, however, the Vineland closure plan\nwas halted when the New Jersey Legislature created the Task Force\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 13 of 40 PageID: 215\non the Closure of State Developmental Centers (the Task Force).\nSee Complaint at ¶71; see also Certification of Gerard Hughes at\n¶2, Exhibit A, Senate No. 2928, Chapter 143 P.L. 2011.2  The task\nforce was charged with performing a “comprehensive evaluation of\nall of the State developmental centers [to] provide recommendations\nfor the closing of developmental centers.”  Exhibit A at ¶2.  The\nlaw required the Task Force to submit a report to the Legislature\ndetailing “its closure recommendations, including, if applicable,\na  targeted  date  for  closure  of  each  developmental  center\nrecommended for closure, and make such other recommendations as the\ntask force deems appropriate.”  In creating the Task Force, the\nLegislature noted that “[t]he State operates more developmental\ncenters  than  necessary  to  support  a  declining  population  of\nindividuals with developmental disabilities, which has decreased by\napproximately 1,200 individuals, or 33 percent, since 1998.”  Id.\nat ¶1(d).

The  Task  Force’s\nrecommendations are binding on DHS.  Id. at ¶4. \nOn  August  1,  2012,  after  a  thorough  review  of  each\ndevelopmental center pursuant to five criteria mandated in the\nenabling statute, the Task Force issued its final report.  See\nAmended Complaint at ¶72; see also Certification of Gerard Hughes\nat ¶3, Exhibit B, The Task Force’s Final Report.  It made binding\nrecommendations  to  DHS  to  close  two  developmental  centers,\nWoodbridge  Developmental  Center  and  North  Jersey  Developmental\nCenter, within the next five years.  Id. at p.3.  The Task Force\nconcluded that Vineland Developmental Center should not be closed.\nIbid.    While  recognizing  that  Vineland  had  previously  been\nidentified for closure, “the Task Force expressed concern that the\nprovider infrastructure in [Vineland’s] region was not as robust as\nin the northern part of the state and that closing Vineland may\nhave  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the  local  economy  in\nCumberland County....”  Ibid.  Thus, there are no plans to close\nVineland Developmental Center at this time.\nBecause the State has not yet decided to close Vineland\nDevelopmental  Center,  and  Plaintiffs  do  not  wish  to  move  from\nVineland, Defendants are not considering Plaintiffs for community\nplacement  at  this  time  and  have  not  offered  them  alternate\nresidential placements.  See Certification of Eloise Hawkins at ¶4-\n10,  Exhibit  C,  Individual  Habilitation  Plan  of  T.C.  at  p.8-9;\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 15 of 40 PageID: 217\nExhibit D, Individual Habilitation Plan of K.C. at p.9-10; Exhibit\nE,  Individual  Habilitation  Plan  of  C.D.  at  p.7-8;  Exhibit  F,\nIndividual Habilitation Plan of L.G. at p.9; Exhibit G, Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  D.H.  at  p.7;  Exhibit  H,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  P.I.  at  p.9;  Exhibit  I,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  B.S.  at  p.8-9.3    Indeed,  Plaintiffs’\nIndividual Habilitation Plans explicitly note their families’ and\nguardians’ opposition to community placement, and indicate that\nPlaintiffs are “not being considered for community placement at\nthis time.”  Ibid. \nIf Vineland someday closes, and if Defendants someday\noffer Plaintiffs other residential placements, then Plaintiffs will\nhave the right to appeal the appropriateness of any prospective\nplacements.

Ibid.\nARGUMENT\nPOINT I\nPLAINTIFFS’  CLAIMS  ARE  NOT  RIPE  BECAUSE\nDEFENDANTS  HAVE  NO  PLAN  TO  CLOSE  VINELAND\nDEVELOPMENTAL CENTER OR TO TRANSFER PLAINTIFFS\nTO ALTERNATE RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS.         \nPlaintiffs’ claims hinge on a litany of contingencies.\nThey assert that, first, Defendants may someday close Vineland\nDevelopmental Center; second, if Vineland closes, Defendants may\noffer Plaintiffs residential placements in the community rather\nthan in institutional settings; and, third, Defendants’ offers of\nplacement may be so substandard that they violate Plaintiffs’ due\nprocess rights.  Notwithstanding their lack of merit, which will be\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 18 of 40 PageID: 220\ndiscussed infra, Plaintiffs’ claims are not ripe for disposition\nbecause Defendants have no plan to close Vineland or to transfer\nPlaintiffs to other residential placements.  The complaint should\nbe dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) because it cannot be\nadjudicated at this time.  \nTo have standing, Plaintiffs must show that they have\nsuffered  an  actual  or  imminent  injury,  and  not  one  that  is\nconjectural or hypothetical.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504  U.S.  555,  560-561  (1992).    “A  claim  is  not  ripe  for\nadjudication if it rests upon ‘contingent future events that may\nnot occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’”  Texas\nv. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998)(citing Thomas v. Union\nCarbide  Agricultural  Products  Co.,  473  U.S.  568,  581  (1985)).\n“Ripeness requires [a court] to evaluate both the fitness of the\nissues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of\nwithholding court consideration.”  Id. at 300-01.  A case must\ninvolve “a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific\nrelief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished\nfrom an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical\nstate of facts.”  Presbytery of N.J. v. Florio, 40 F.3d 1454, 1463\n(3d Cir. 1994)(quoting North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246\n(1971)).  A federal court’s jurisdiction can only be invoked when\na plaintiff presents a ripe controversy.  Ibid. (citing Warth v.\nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975)).\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 19 of 40 PageID: 221\nIn Texas v. United States, supra, 523 U.S. at 297-98, the\nTexas Legislature enacted a scheme whereby local school boards\nwould be accountable to the state for student achievement.  Texas\nrequired  pre-clearance  from  the  Federal  government  before  it\nimplemented  changes  affecting  voting  because  it  was  a  covered\njurisdiction under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Id. at\n298-99.  The state sought pre-clearance that its accountability\nscheme  did  not  have  any  effect  on  voting.    Id.  at  299.    The\nAttorney  General  did  not  object  to  the  scheme,  itself,  but\ncautioned that implementation of certain provisions of the scheme\ncould result in a violation of Section 5, which would require pre-\nclearance.  Ibid.    The provisions at issue allowed the state to\nappoint  a  master  or  a  management  team  to  oversee  a  school\ndistrict’s operations.  Id. at 298-99.  Texas sought a declaratory\njudgment from District Court that Section 5 did not apply to the\nsubject provisions, but the court ruled that the matter was not\nripe.  Id. at 299.  \nThe Supreme Court affirmed the District Court’s ruling.\nTexas v. United States, supra, 523 U.S. at 302.  It noted that\nwhether  Texas  would  appoint  a  master  or  management  team  was\ncontingent on several factors: first, a school district must fall\nbelow standards; second, the State must impose sanctions lesser\nthan  a  master  or  management  team;  and  third,  the  State  would\nappoint a master or management team only if these lesser sanctions\n13\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 20 of 40 PageID: 222\nwere ineffective and only to the extent necessary.  Id. at 300.\nWhile Texas asked the Court to rule that under no circumstances\ncould  the  imposition  of  these  sanctions  constitute  a  change\naffecting  voting,  the  Court  remarked  that  it  “[did]  not  have\nsufficient confidence in [its] powers of imagination to affirm such\na negative.”  Id. at 301.  The Court found that the matter was not\nripe for dispute, noting that the “determination of the scope of\nlegislation  in  advance  of  its  immediate  adverse  effect  in  the\ncontext of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an\ninquiry for the proper exercise of judicial function.”  Id. at 301\n(citing Longshoreman v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 224 (1954)).\nIn  the  instant  matter,  the  court  cannot  adjudicate\nPlaintiffs’ claims because they hinge on a series of contingencies\nthat have not yet occurred, and may not occur at all.  Defendants\nhave no plan to close Vineland Developmental Center.  The Task\nForce recommended that DHS close two other developmental centers,\nWoodbridge and North Jersey, within five years.  See Certification\nof Gerard Hughes at ¶3, Exhibit B, The Task Force’s Final Report at\np.3.  The Task Force explicitly recommended that Vineland not be\nclosed, finding that “the provider infrastructure in [Vineland’s]\nregion was not as robust as in the northern part of the state and\nthat closing Vineland may have a significant adverse impact on the\nlocal economy in Cumberland County....”  Ibid.  Thus, there are no\nplans to close Vineland Developmental Center at this time.\n14\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 21 of 40 PageID: 223\nLikewise,  Defendants  are  not  planning  to  transfer\nPlaintiffs  to  other  residential  facilities  because  Plaintiffs’\nguardians have indicated that Plaintiffs wish to stay at Vineland.\nSee Certification of Eloise Hawkins at ¶4-10, Exhibit C, Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  T.C.  at  p.8-9;  Exhibit  D,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  K.C.  at  p.9-10;  Exhibit  E,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  C.D.  at  p.7-8;  Exhibit  F,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  L.G.  at  p.9;  Exhibit  G,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  D.H.  at  p.7;  Exhibit  H,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  P.I.  at  p.9;  Exhibit  I,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  B.S  at  p.8-9.    Plaintiffs’  Individual\nHabilitation Plans, which are referenced in the amended complaint,\nexplicitly  note  their  families’  and  guardians’  opposition  to\ncommunity placement, and indicate that Plaintiffs are “not being\nconsidered for community placement at this time.”  Ibid.  In fact,\nthe treatment team of one Plaintiff does not even feel that this\nindividual is capable of living in the community at this time.  See\nCertification of Elosie Hawkins at ¶9, Exhibit H at p.9.   \nIn sum, Plaintiffs’ claims are hypothetical and do not\npresent a ripe dispute.  The court should not adjudicate whether\nDefendants are required to offer institutional care to Plaintiffs\nat Vineland or another developmental center when Plaintiffs are not\nslated  to  move  anywhere.    Indeed,  if  Vineland  someday  closes,\nDefendants may very well offer Plaintiffs an institutional level of\n15\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 22 of 40 PageID: 224\nservices that Plaintiffs find acceptable.  Likewise, the court\ncannot  possibly  decide  whether  an  offer  of  placement  is  so\ndeficient that it violates an individual’s due process rights when\nthe offer does not yet exist and may never exist.  Therefore,\nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint, which seeks an advisory opinion from\nthe court setting conditions on their theoretical transfers from\nVineland,  should  be  dismissed  because  it  is  not  ripe  for\nadjudication.        \n                      POINT II\nPLAINTIFFS’ ADA AND REHABILITATION ACT CLAIMS\nSHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THESE LAWS DO NOT\nREQUIRE  DEFENDANTS  TO  SERVE  INDIVIDUALS  IN\nINSTITUTIONS.                                \nPlaintiffs  attempt  to  turn  the  Americans  with\nDisabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act on their heads by\nasserting that the laws require Defendants to serve Plaintiffs in\na particular developmental center.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act\nare  anti-discrimination  laws  which  require  States  to  serve\nindividuals with disabilities in the least-restrictive environment\nappropriate to their needs.  The statutes do not compel a State to\nserve individuals in institutions because providing services in a\nmore integrated community setting, even against an individual’s\nwishes, is not discriminatory.5  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not\n5 Defendants do not concede that they will serve Plaintiffs\nin  community  settings  against  Plaintiffs’  wishes  in  the  event\nPlaintiffs are ever transferred, as Plaintiffs predict.   \n16\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 23 of 40 PageID: 225\nstated viable claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, and\ntheir complaint should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  The  ADA  provides  “a  clear  and  comprehensive national\nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals\nwith disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. §12101(b)(1).  In enacting the ADA,\nCongress found that “historically, society has tended to isolate\nand  segregate  individuals  with  disabilities,”  and  that\ndiscrimination  “persist[ed]  in  such  critical  areas  as  ...\ninstitutionalization.”  42 U.S.C. §12101(a)(2) and( 3).  “The ADA\nstepped up earlier measures to secure opportunities for people with\ndevelopmental  disabilities  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  community\nliving.”  Olmstead, supra, 527 U.S. at 599.        \nTitle II of the ADA, under which Plaintiffs attempt to\nbring their claims, concerns public services.  42 U.S.C. §12131 et\nseq.  Title II provides that:\nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter,\nno  qualified  individual  with  a  disability\nshall,  by  reason  of  such  disability,  be\nexcluded from participation in or be denied\nthe  benefits  of  the  services,  programs,  or\nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected\nto discrimination by any such entity.\n42 U.S.C. §12132.\nCongress  instructed  the  Attorney  General  to  issue\nregulations  implementing  Title  II  of  the  ADA.    See  42  U.S.C.\n§12134(a).    These  regulations  require  States  to  “administer\nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting\n17\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 24 of 40 PageID: 226\nappropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with\ndisabilities.”  28 C.F.R. §35.130(d).  Their preamble defines “most\nintegrated setting” to mean a “setting that enables individuals\nwith disabilities to interact with non-disabled individuals to the\nfullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, p.450 (1998).\nIn promulgating these regulations, “the Attorney General concluded\nthat unjustified placement or retention of persons in institutions,\nseverely  limiting  their  exposure  to  the  outside  community,\nconstitutes a form of discrimination based on disability prohibited\nby Title II.”  Olmstead, supra, 527 U.S. at 597.       \nSimilar to the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nprovides that:\n[n]o  otherwise  qualified  individual  with  a\ndisability in the United States, . . . shall,\nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be\nexcluded from the participation in, be denied\nthe  benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving  Federal  financial  assistance  or\nunder any program or activity conducted by any\nExecutive  agency  or  by  the  United  States\nPostal Service.\n29 U.S.C. §794(a).  \n“The language and implementing regulations of the ADA and RA are\nvirtually the same.”  Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare of the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, 364 F.3d 487, 490, fn.2 (3d. Cir.\n2004).  Accordingly, the Third Circuit has “construed [the laws] in\nlight of their close similarity of language and purpose.”  Id. at\n18\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 25 of 40 PageID: 227\n491 (citing Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 330-32 (3d Cir.\n1995)).  \n“The  ADA  and  RA’s  anti-discrimination  principles\nculminate in their integration mandates, which direct states to\n‘administer  services,  programs,  and  activities  in  the  most\nintegrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified\nindividuals with disabilities.’”  Frederick L., supra, 364 F.3d at\n491(citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d)); see also 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d).\nWhere appropriate, “the ADA and RA favor integrated, community-\nbased treatment over institutionalization.”  Frederick L., supra,\n364 F.3d at 491-92.          \nIn Olmstead, supra, 527 U.S. at 587, the Supreme Court,\nin a plurality opinion, found that under Title II of the ADA,\nspecifically,  42  U.S.C.  §12132,  and  28  C.F.R.  35.130(d),  if  a\nState’s treating professionals have determined that a person can be\nserved in the community and the person does not oppose community\nplacement, then the State is responsible to make such placement or\nshow justification for why it need not under the ADA “fundamental\nalterations”  provisions.    The  Court  found  that  recognition  of\n“unjustified institutional isolation” of persons with disabilities\nas  discrimination  reflects  two  judgments:  first,  placing\nindividuals who can benefit from community settings in institutions\nperpetuates  unwarranted  assumptions  that  they  are  incapable  or\nunworthy  of  participating  in  community  life;  and,  second,\n19\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 26 of 40 PageID: 228\n“confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday\nlife activities of individuals, including family relations, social\ncontracts,  work  options,  economic  independence,  educational\nadvancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Id. at 600-01. \nIn  ruling  that  qualified  individuals  should  receive\nservices in the community, the Court “emphasize[d] that nothing in\nthe ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of\ninstitutional settings for persons unable to handle of benefit from\ncommunity settings.”  Olmstead, supra, 527 U.S. at 601-02.  “Title\nII provides only that ‘qualified individuals with a disability’ may\nnot ‘be subjected to discrimination.’” Ibid. (citing 42 U.S.C. §\n12132).  \nPlaintiffs seize on this qualifying language in Olmstead\nto  allege  that  their  hypothetical  transfers  from  Vineland\nDevelopmental Center to more-integrated community settings would\nviolate the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  See Complaint at ¶78, 81.\nPlaintiffs misinterpret these laws.  The Court in Olmstead stated\nthat  nothing  in  the  ADA  condones  the  transfer  of  unwilling\nindividuals from institutions to the community.  Olmstead, supra,\n527 U.S. at 601-02.  It did not, however, indicate that the ADA\nprohibits such transfers.  \nThe  ADA  and  Rehabilitation  Act  forbid  discrimination\nagainst qualified individuals with disabilities; they do not impose\na standard of care on the services that a State chooses to provide.\n20\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 27 of 40 PageID: 229\nSee Olmstead, supra 527 U.S. at 603, fn.14.  Thus, the issue in\nthis case regarding Plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims\nis not whether their potential transfers are desired, but whether\nthey are discriminatory.  Offering services in a more-integrated\nsetting is not discrimination under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\nThese laws forbid “unjustified institutionalization,” and not de-\ninstitutionalization, because the former “perpetuates unwarranted\nassumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of\nparticipating  in  community  life”  and  “severely  diminishes  he\neveryday  life  activities  of  individuals.”    Id.  at  600-01.     \nPlaintiffs’ transfers from Vineland to the community,\nshould they ever occur, would not be discriminatory.  Indeed, the\nservices Plaintiffs wish to maintain at a developmental center are\nonly offered to individuals with developmental disabilities.  Thus,\nany transfer of Plaintiffs from Vineland to the community would not\nbe a denial of benefits by reason of Plaintiffs’ disabilities, an\nessential component of an ADA and Rehabilitation Act claim.  That\nis, Defendants would not be excluding Plaintiffs from services that\nnon-disabled individuals receive, but rather offering them services\nin  a  “setting  that  enables  individuals  with  disabilities  to\ninteract  with  non-disabled  individuals  to  the  fullest  extent\npossible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, p.450 (1998).  Accordingly,\neven if Plaintiffs claims were ripe, they fail to state a cause of\naction under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act.          \n21\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 28 of 40 PageID: 230\nLikewise, Plaintiffs’ claim that the ADA entitles them to\n“receive recommendations from treating professionals as to whether\ncommunity placement is the most appropriate to their needs” is\nwithout merit.6  See Amended Complaint at ¶87.  The ADA does not\nimpose on Defendants a duty to assess individuals for community\nplacement, but rather the Supreme Court in Olmstead ruled that a\ntreatment team’s assessment that an individual could safely reside\nin  the  community  was  a  condition  of  eligibility  for  community\nplacement.  Id. at 602.  Thus, while an individual who desires\ncommunity  placement  could  conceivably  argue  that  his  treatment\nteam’s failure to recommend the same thwarted his right under the\nADA to receive services in the community, the ADA, itself, does not\nrequire such assessments.  \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ complaint that the their treatment\nteams’  recommendations  are  unfairly  influenced  by  Defendants\npolicies, see Amended Complaint at ¶65-66, does not state a claim\nupon which relief can be granted.  First, even if Plaintiffs’\ntreatment teams have opined that Plaintiffs are capable of living\n6  Notably,  all  of  the  Plaintiffs  have  received  annual\nassessments  regarding  their  appropriateness  for  and  desire  for\ncommunity placement as documented by their individual habilitation\nplans, which are referenced in the Amended Complaint.  See Amended\nComplaint at ¶65-66.       \n22\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 29 of 40 PageID: 231\nin the community with the right supports,7 these opinions are not\nresulting  in  any  action  because  Plaintiffs’  guardians  have\nindicated that Plaintiffs do not wish to move to the community.\nConsequently, Plaintiffs are not being considered for community\nplacement at this time.  See Certification of Eloise Hawkins at ¶4-\n10,  Exhibit  C,  Individual  Habilitation  Plan  of  T.C.  at  p.8-9;\nExhibit D, Individual Habilitation Plan of K.C. at p.9-10; Exhibit\nE,  Individual  Habilitation  Plan  of  C.D.  at  p.7-8;  Exhibit  F,\nIndividual Habilitation Plan of L.G. at p.9; Exhibit G, Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  D.H.  at  p.7;  Exhibit  H,  Individual\nHabilitation  Plan  of  P.I.  at  p.9;  Exhibit  I,  Individual\nHabilitation Plan of B.S. at p.8-9.  No reason exists for this\ncourt to adjudicate whether Plaintiffs are capable of living in the\ncommunity  with  the  right  supports,  as  the  majority  of  their\ntreatment professionals opine, when there are no plans to transfer\nPlaintiffs  to  the  community.    Second,  assuming  argunedo  that\nDefendants had a policy expressing that every individual could be\nserved in the community with the right supports, this opinion would\nnot  violate  the  ADA  or  Rehabilitation  Act  because  providing\nservices in a more integrated setting is not discriminatory, and\nexplained above.   \n7 Notably, the treatment team for one Plaintiff has opined\nthat this individual is not capable of living in the community at\nthis time.  See Certification of Elosie Hawkins at ¶9, Exhibit H.\n23\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 30 of 40 PageID: 232\nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs have not stated a valid\ncause of action under ADA and Rehabilitation Act and their amended\ncomplaint should be dismissed.   \n                POINT III\nPLAINTIFFS’  MEDICAID  ACT  CLAIMS  SHOULD  BE\nDISMISSED  BECAUSE  THE  ACT  DOES  NOT  REQUIRE\nDEFENDANTS TO SERVE PLAINTIFFS IN A PARTICULAR\nINSTITUTION.                                 \nPlaintiffs’ allegation that the Medicaid Act entitles\nthem  to  receive  services  at  Vineland  Developmental  Center  is\nwithout merit.  The Medicaid Act requires a participating state to\nprovide an institutional level of services; it does not require a\nstate  to  offer  care  in  a  particular  institution.    Therefore,\nPlaintiffs’ complaint, in which they attempt to use the Medicaid\nAct prevent the potential closure of Vineland, should be dismissed.\nPursuant  to  N.J.S.A.  30:4D-1  et  seq.,  New  Jersey\nparticipates in the Medicaid Program established by Title XIX of\nthe Social Security Act (the \"Act\"), 42 U.S.C.A. 1396 et seq.  The\nMedicaid  program  is  a  joint  federal-state  program  designed  to\nprovide medical assistance to qualified individuals \"whose income\nand  resources  are  insufficient  to  meet  the  cost  of  necessary\nmedical services.\"  42 U.S.C.A. 1396.  In short, “Medicaid was\ncreated to provide medical assistance to the poor at the expense of\nthe public.”  Mistrick v. Division of Medical Assistance and Health\nServices,  154  N.J.  158,  165  (1998);    Estate  of  DeMartino  v.\nDivision of Medical Assistance and Health Services, 373 N.J. Super.\n24\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 31 of 40 PageID: 233\n210, 217 (App. Div. 2004), certif. denied, 182 N.J. 425 (2005).\nThe Federal Government shares the cost of medical assistance with\nstates  that  elect  to  participate  in  the  Medicaid  program.\nMistrick, 154 N.J. at 165-66; DeMartino, 373 N.J. Super. at 217.\nParticipating states must adopt medical assistance plans that meet\nthe requirements of the federal Medicaid law.  DeMartino, 373 N.J.\nSuper. at 217.\nNew Jersey participates in the Medicaid program pursuant\nto the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act (the\nAct), N.J.S.A. 30:4D-1 et seq.  The Division of Medical Assistance\nand  Health  Services  within  DHS  is  the  State  agency  designated\npursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. 1396a(a)(5), to administer the Medicaid\nprogram in New Jersey. N.J.S.A. 30:4D-5; N.J.S.A. 30:4D-7.\nThe expressed intent of the Legislature is that the State\nbe enabled, within the limits of funds available for any fiscal\nyear,  to  obtain  all  benefits  provided  by  the  Federal  Social\nSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C.A. 301 et seq., N.J.S.A. 30:4D-2.  Thus,\nN.J.S.A. 30:4D-1 et seq. requires that the Department take all\nnecessary steps, consistent with fiscal responsibility, for the\nproper administration of the New Jersey Medicaid Program.\nPlaintiffs rely on several provisions of the Medicaid\nAct, as well as its implementing regulations, in support of their\ncontention that the Act requires Defendants to serve Plaintiffs at\nVineland Developmental Center.  See Amended Complaint at ¶105-113.\n25\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 32 of 40 PageID: 234\nNone of these provisions entitles Plaintiffs to receive care in\ntheir preferred institution. \n42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(15) requires medical assistance under\nthe State’s Medicaid plan to include “services in an intermediate\ncare  facility  for  the  mentally  retarded  [ICF/MR].”    The  State\ndevelopmental  centers  provide  an  ICF/MR  level  of  care.    See\nComplaint at ¶35.  Likewise, 42 U.S.C. 1396n(c)(2)(C) provides that\na  waiver  shall  not  be  granted  unless  the  State  assures  that\nindividuals who are eligible to participate in a State’s waiver\nprogram are “informed of the feasible alternatives, if available\nunder  the  waiver,  at  the  choice  of  such  individuals,  to  the\nprovision  of  inpatient  hospital  services,  nursing  facility\nservices, or [ICF/MR] services.”  \nThe  regulations  implementing  the  Medicaid  Act  also\nrequire a State to provide ICF/MR level of services.  42 C.F.R.\n441.302(d) requires, as a precursor to a grant of a waiver, that a\nState give beneficiaries “the choice of either institutional or\nhome and community based services.”\nThus, the Medicaid Act does not require Defendants to\nserve  individuals  in  a  particular  institution,  like  Vineland\nDevelopmental Center, but to offer the choice of ICF/MR level of\nservices.  Indeed, if individuals had a right to receive services\nat any chosen facility, states would be hamstrung from allocating\nresources in a fiscally responsible manner.  Plaintiffs’ attempt to\n26\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 33 of 40 PageID: 235\nuse the Medicaid Act to prevent the closure of Vineland finds no\nsupport  in  the  law,  and  their  amended  complaint  should  be\ndismissed.  \nLastly, Plaintiff’s reliance on 42 C.F.R. 483.440 is also\nmistaken.    While  that  regulation  requires  ICF/MRs  to  provide\nbeneficiaries “a continuous active treatment program,” it does not\nprohibit  states  from  transferring  individuals  to  different\nfacilities.  Indeed, the regulation includes provisions applicable\nwhen an individual “is to be either transferred or discharged.”\nSee  42  C.F.R.  483.440(b)(4).    Thus,  rather  than  forbidding  a\ntransfer, the regulation contemplates such action.               \nPOINT IV\nTHE  COURT  SHOULD  ABSTAIN  FROM  HEARING\nPLAINTIFFS’  DUE  PROCESS  CLAIMS  BECAUSE  THE\nSTATE  HAS  AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  AND  JUDICIAL\nAPPEAL  PROCESS  TO  ADJUDICATE  THE\nAPPROPRIATENESS  OF  DEFENDANTS’  OFFERS  OF\nRESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT.                       \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants’ offers of alternate\nresidential placements, if these offers are ever made, will be so\ndeficient that they will violate Plaintiffs’ due process rights.\nEven if the court finds that Plaintiffs’ due process claims are\nripe, it should abstain from adjudicating these claims because\nPlaintiffs may avail themselves to an administrative and judicial\nappeal  process  if  they  are  displeased  with  any  offers  of\nresidential placement they may receive.  The State standard by\nwhich such offers of placement are judged in this appeal process\n27\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 34 of 40 PageID: 236\nfar exceeds the federal due process standard.  The court should\ndefer to this process under the Burford abstention doctrine, rather\nthan attempting to hear appeals regarding the appropriateness of\neach  offer  of  placements  to  particular  individuals  in  a  class\naction, as Plaintiffs propose.8      \nWhile federal courts generally exercise the jurisdiction\nconferred upon them by Congress, a District Court should decline to\nexercise  jurisdiction  when  doing  so  would  “clearly  serve  a\ncountervailing interest.”  Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517\nU.S. 706, 716 (1996).  The concept of abstention has been refined\nover the years and has been applied in a variety of contexts.\nIbid.  The unifying principle behind various abstention doctrines\nis “deference to the paramount interests of another sovereign, and\nthe concern is with principles of comity and federalism.” Id. at\n723. \nIn Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), the\nplaintiff  brought  a  Fourteenth  Amendment  challenge  to  the\nreasonableness of the Texas Railroad Commission’s grant of an oil\n8 Although they include “class action allegations” in their\ncomplaint, Plaintiffs have not yet moved to certify a class under\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23.  See E. Texas Motor Freight Sys., Inc. v.\nRodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 404-05 (1977)(A plaintiff’s failure to\nmove for class certification prior to trial may be reason to deny\ncertification).  As will be more fully argued in opposition to any\nmotion for class certification, Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the\nappropriateness of residential services are highly individualistic,\nand cannot possibly be litigated in a class action.  Moreover,\nPlaintiffs  seek  to  represent  all  residents  of  Vineland\nDevelopmental Center, some of whom desire community placement.   \n28\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 35 of 40 PageID: 237\ndrilling  permit.    The  constitutional  challenge  involved  the\nquestion of whether the commission had properly applied the state’s\ncomplex oil and gas conservation regulations.  New Orleans Public\nService, Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350,\n360 (1989)(citing Burford, supra, 319 U.S. at 331).  Texas had\ncreated “a centralized system of judicial review of commission\norders,  which  ‘permitted  the  state  courts,  like  the  Railroad\nCommission  itself,  to  acquire  a  specialized  knowledge’  of  the\nregulations and industry.”  Ibid. (quoting Burford, supra, 319 U.S.\nat 327).  The Supreme Court concluded that, because the exercise of\nequitable jurisdiction by Federal District Courts alongside state\ncourt review had repeatedly led to “delay, misunderstanding of\nlocal law, and needless federal conflict with the state policy,...\na sound respect for the independence of state action required the\nfederal equity court to stay its hand.”  Ibid. (quoting Burford,\nsupra, 319 U.S. at 327, 334). \nFrom Burford and its progeny, the Supreme Court developed\nthe abstention principle now commonly referred to as the “Burford\ndoctrine.”  New Orleans Public Service, supra 491 U.S. at 361.  The\nparameters of this doctrine are as follows:              \n[w]here timely and adequate state-court review\nis  available,  a  federal  court  sitting  in\nequity  must  decline  to  interfere  with  the\nproceedings or orders of state administrative\nagencies:  (1)  when  there  are  difficult\nquestions  of  state  law  bearing  on  policy\nproblems  of  public  import  whose  importance\ntranscends the result in the case then at bar;\n29\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 36 of 40 PageID: 238\nor (2) where the exercise of federal review of\nthe question in a case and in similar cases\nwould  be  disruptive  of  state  efforts  to\nestablish a coherent policy with respect to a\nmatter of substantial public concern.\nIbid.;  see  also  Chiropractic  America  v.\nLaVecchia, 180 F.3d 99, 104 (3d Cir. 1999).\nThe Burford doctrine requires abstention in this case\nbecause Plaintiffs may appeal any offers of residential placement\nthrough  an  administrative  and  judicial  appeal  process.    The\nstandard by which offers of placement are judged in this State\nappeal process far exceeds any due process standard.  Further,\nfederal review in this case would disrupt the State’s efforts to\nmaintain coherent policy regarding offers of residential placement\nto some of its most vulnerable citizens.    \nFirst,  timely  and  adequate  State  proceedings  exist\nthrough which Plaintiff may obtain the relief they seek.  State law\nrequires  services  offered  by  any  facility  to  persons  with\ndevelopmental  disabilities  to  “be  designed  to  maximize  the\ndevelopmental potential of [individuals receiving services] and\n[to] be provided in humane manner in accordance with generally\naccepted standards ... and with full recognition and respect for\nthe  dignity,  individuality  and  constitutional,  civil  and  legal\nrights of [such individuals], and in a setting and manner which is\nleast restrictive of each person’s personal liberty.”  N.J.S.A.\n30:6D-9; see also J.E. v. Division of Developmental Disabilities,\n131 N.J. 552, 565 (1993)(holding that DDD’s clients have a “right,\n30\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 37 of 40 PageID: 239\nbased  on  statutory  and  regulatory  entitlements,  to  the  most\nappropriate  placement  available  that  best  can  enhance  their\ndevelopmental potential in the least-restrictive setting.”).   \nIn contrast, the due process clause affords the right to\nonly “minimally adequate training.”9  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S.\n307, 322 (1982).  Decisions by treating professionals are presumed\nvalid, and “liability may be imposed only when the decision by a\nprofessional  is  such  a  substantial  departure  from  accepted\nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate\nthat the person responsible actually did not base the decision on\nsuch a judgment.”  Id. at 323.  \nThus, the standard by which DDD’s offers of placement are\njudged in the State appeal process far exceeds the due process\nstandard  by  which  this  court  may  judge  these  same  offers  of\nplacement.  In fact, the Supreme Court in Youngberg recognized that\n“[b]y so limiting judicial review of challenges to conditions in\nstate institutions, interference by the federal judiciary with the\ninternal operations of these institutions should be minimized.”\nId. at 322.  \nPlaintiffs may appeal the appropriateness of any offers\nof residential placement through an administrative and judicial\n9  Notably,  Youngberg  involved  individuals  who  were\ninvoluntarily committed to state institutions.  Id. at 309.  In the\ncase at bar, Plaintiffs voluntarily receive services and are not\ninvoluntarily committed.  \n31\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 38 of 40 PageID: 240\nappeal process.  See N.J.A.C. 10:46B-5.1; see also J.E., supra, 131\nN.J. at 568-69 (holding that placement appeals warrant trial-type\nhearings in OAL hearing with the burden of proof on DDD).  DDD will\ntransmit appeals regarding offers of placement to the OAL for an\nevidentiary hearing.  See N.J.A.C. 10:46B-5.1; N.J.A.C. 10:48-2.1.\nAfter  a  hearing,  the  Administrative  Law  Judge  will  issue  a\ndecision, which shall be adopted, rejected, or modified by the\nAssistant  Commissioner  for  DDD.    See  N.J.A.C.  10:48-7.1(d).\nPlaintiffs may then appeal the Assistant Commissioner’s decision to\nthe Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division.  See N.J.A.C.\n10:48-7.1(d); N.J. Ct. R. 2:2-3(a)(2).  Thus, as required by the\nBurford  doctrine,  timely  and  adequate  state-court  review  is\navailable to Plaintiffs should Defendants offer them residential\nplacements  they  find  inappropriate.    See  New  Orleans  Public\nService, supra 491 U.S. at 361. \nSecond,  federal  review  would  frustrate  the  State’s\nability  to  maintain  a  consistent  policy  with  respect  to  the\nprovision  of  services  to  individuals  with  developmental\ndisabilities, some of the State’s most vulnerable citizens. See\nChiropractic, supra, 180 F.3d at 104.  Caring for these individuals\nis  a  matter  of  substantial  public  concern.    Accordingly,  the\nState’s  Developmentally  Disabled  Rights  Act  denotes  rights  and\nestablishes standards for services.  N.J.S.A. 30:6D-2.  As the\nagency charged with the provision and oversight of these services,\n32\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 39 of 40 PageID: 241\nN.J.S.A.  30:6D-26,  DDD  possesses  a  specialized  expertise  in\nassessing the appropriateness of services it provides to particular\nindividuals.  See Newark v. Natural Resource Council, Dep’t of\nEnvt’l Protection, 82 N.J. 530, 539, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 983\n(1980)(“The presumption of reasonableness of agency decisions is\neven stronger [when] the agency has been delegated discretion to\ndetermine the specialized and technical procedures for its tasks”).\nDDD’s assessments are further buttressed by trial-type hearings in\nthe OAL regarding offers of placement, as well as judicial review\nof final agency decisions.  \nFederal review of DDD’s offers of placement would upset\nthe agency’s employment of its specialized expertise in disputes\nregarding offers of residential placement.  The court’s exercise of\njurisdiction in this case would prevent DDD, as well as a reviewing\nState court, from judging the appropriateness of specific offers of\nplacements  to  particular  individuals  under  the  coherent  State\nstandard  set  forth  in  the  agency’s  statutes  and  regulations.\nInstead, the court would collectively review offers of placement to\nPlaintiffs,  as  well  as  the  entire  population  of  Vineland\nDevelopmental Center if Plaintiffs’ proposed class is certified,\nunder the minimal due process standard.  Such review would thwart\nthe State’s ability to maintain a coherent policy with respect to\nthe  provision  of  services  to  individuals  with  developmental\ndisabilities, undoubtedly a matter of substantial public concern.\n33\n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 33-1   Filed 02/08/13   Page 40 of 40 PageID: 242\nTherefore, the court should abstain from hearing Plaintiffs’ claims\nunder the Burford abstention doctrine.         \nCONCLUSI O N\nFor  all  the  foregoing  reasons,  Plaintiff’s  complaint\nshould be dismissed.\n     JEFFREY S.

NO.:  1:12-cv-02S22 \nv. \nCHRISTOPHER CHRISTIE, as \nGovernor ofthe State of New Jersey, et aI., \nDefendants. \nPLAINTIFFS' BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS \nPlaintiffs, a class of individuals residing at Vineland Developmental Center, through their \ncounsel, file this Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12. \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThe Plaintiffs brought this action to address serious and ongoing violations of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., the Rehabilitation \nAct (\"Rehab Act\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), et seq., the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq., and \nthe United States Constitution.  The Plaintiffs have named the state agencies and officials \nresponsible for violating Plaintiffs' rights and failing to provide basic protections to Plaintiffs. \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. # 33] and supporting arguments fail for the \nfollowing reasons: (1) Plaintiffs' claims are made independent of Defendants' public \npronouncements recommending the closure of the Vineland Developmental Center (\"VDC\") or \nany other facility, and the Defendants have discharged and continue to attempt to discharge \nPlaintiffs from VDC in violation of Plaintiffs' rights secured by the Olmstead decision; (2) as \nlong as Defendants continue to take federal funds and operate large, public ICFslIID \n(intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities), Plaintiffs do have a \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 2 of 31 PageID: 467\nright to receive services at such facilities if Plaintiffs' treating professionals independently \nrecommend receiving services in those settings and Plaintiffs consent to receiving services there; \n(3) Plaintiffs have not alleged that they are entitled to receive services in a particular location, \nbut the Medicaid Act and ADA require Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with services in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of the Plaintiffs, which often is a state-operated \nICF/IID (formerly referred to as \"ICFIMR\") (See Olmstead v. Zimring, et aI., 527 U.S. 581,605 \n(1999)); (4) this Court cannot rely on the State of New Jersey's administrative process to ensure \nthat Plaintiffs' federal rights are protected, because the State's system for assessing and \ndischarging Plaintiffs from VDC specifically fails to comply with federal law; and (5) \nDefendants improperly include Individual Habilitation Plans (IHP' s) of each of the named \nPlaintiffs as well as the declarations of Eloise Hawkins and Gerard Hughes as exhibits to their \nMotion to Dismiss which cannot be properly considered by this Court for purposes of a Rule \n12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, as these documents were not attached to the Amended Complaint, \nnor do Plaintiffs' claims rest on the content of these documents. \nThe allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint meet the requirements of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, the ADA, Rehab Act, Medicaid Act, and the United States \nConstitution.  The Defendants' Motion should be denied. \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  EXHIBITS REFERRED TO IN DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS \nSHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT \nDefendants inappropriately attached several exhibits to their Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs' Amended Complaint, including Task Force Legislation and Final Report (Exhibit A, \nB),[Dkt. #33-3]; Individual Habilitation Plans (\"IHP\") for each of the Plaintiffs in this case \n(Exhibits C-I); Certification of Eloise Hawkins.  These documents and attachments can not be \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 3 of 31 PageID: 468\nconsidered by this Court for purposes of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nAs a general matter, a District Court ruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider \nmatters extraneous to the pleadings. San Pellegrino S.P.A. v. Aggressive Partnerships, Inc., 2009 \nWL 2448504 (D.N.J. Aug. 10,2009) (citing In Re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d \n1410, 1426 (3d Cir.1997); Angelastro v. Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc., 764 F.2d 939,944 \n(3d Cir.1985).  However, there are limited exceptions to this rule.  In addition to the allegations \nof the complaint, a court may consider matters of public record, documents specifically \nreferenced in or attached to the complaint, and documents integral to the allegations raised in the \ncomplaint. Mele v. Federal Reserve Bank ofN.Y., 359 F.3d 251,255 n. 5 (3d Cir.2004).  The \ndocuments referenced above do not fall into any of these exceptions.  In San Pellegrino, this \nCourt analyzed a similar situation when exhibits were attached to defendant's motion to dismiss \nwhich were certifications of defendant's officers containing statements that contradicted \nallegations contained in the complaint.  In declining to consider these exhibits, this Court \nfollowed the standard set forth by Third Circuit Court of Appeals: \"the exhibits are documents \nextraneous to the pleadings, and do not fall within exceptions to the rule prohibiting this Court \nfrom considering them on a motion to dismiss.\" (citing Mele, 359 F.3d at 255 n. 5). An \n\"undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss\" \nis only deemed integral within the exceptions if the plaintiffs claims are based on the document. \n(citing Pension Benefit Gauranty Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1996 (3d \nCir.1993».  In San Pellegrino, the District Court ruled that the plaintiff's claims were not based \non the certifications ofthe defendant's officers.  Therefore, since the certifications attached as \nexhibits to defendant's motion to dismiss were not integral to the pleadings and did not fall \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 4 of 31 PageID: 469\nwithin the exception to the general rule, they could not be considered.  Like the exhibits in San \nPellegrino, the exhibits attached to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss are also not integral to the \nAmended Complaint since the claims for relief in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint are not based \non the contents of those exhibits, but rather, are entirely independent ofthe content of these \ndocuments.  In fact, whether or not those exhibits exist is irrelevant to the claims pursued by \nPlaintiffs.  Also irrelevant to this matter is any statement from Eloise Hawkins presented in the \nform of a certification.  Furthermore, the exhibits attached to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss \nwere not authenticated and Plaintiffs have not stipulated to their authenticity.  Therefore, the \nexhibits to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss should be disregarded by this Court. \nIn support of their inclusion of said exhibits, Defendants cite to three (3) Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals cases: Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power Co., 147 F. 3d 256, 259 (3rd Cir. 1998); \nKeystone Redevelopment Partners, LLC v. Decker, 631 F. 3d 89, 95 (3rd Cir. 2011); and In re \nBurlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. 114 F. 3d 1410, 1426 (3rd Cir. 1997).  However, each of \nthese cases is distinguishable from the instant case in that they involve documents which were \neither attached to the complaint, submitted and stipulated to by both parties, or documents upon \nwhich the claims of the complaint specifically rely.  For example, in Pittsburgh v. West Penn \nPower Co., there were documents submitted to the Court by both parties during the motion to \ndismiss phase.  The Third Circuit Court noted\" .. .it can be, and is in this instance, proper to \nconsider these documents in reviewing a motion to dismiss.\"  Citing, Pension Benefit Quar. \nCorp. v. White Consol. Industries, 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3rd Cir. 1993)(finding that \"a court may \nconsider an undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion \nto dismiss if the plaintiffs claims are based on the document.\").  The parties in that case \nstipulated to the authenticity ofthe documents and submitted the documents as joint appendix in \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 5 of 31 PageID: 470\nthat case.  The Third Circuit noted in its opinion that, in deciding a motion to dismiss, it is the \n, \npractice of the Court to \"consider only the allegations contained in the complaint, exhibits \nattached to the complaint and matters of public record.\" Id. at 259. (emphasis added).  However, \nsince the authenticity of these documents was stipulated by the parties, the Court used the \ndocuments to provide context to the averments of the complaint.  There is no such situation here. \nTo the contrary, Plaintiffs have not stipulated to the authenticity of these documents, nor was a \nstipulation requested by Defendants.  In fact, Plaintiffs cannot confirm the authenticity, \nrelevancy, and weight of these documents because there has not been any proper discovery. \nThus, there is no similarity between the circumstances here and those of Pittsburgh v. West Penn \nPower.  Therefore, since Plaintiffs did not attach these documents as exhibits to the Amended \nComplaint, did not stipulate to their authenticity, and none of the Plaintiffs' claims are based on \nthe content of these documents, they do not fall within the exception noted by the Third Circuit \nin Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power. \nDefendants also cite to two (2) other Third Circuit Court opinions:  Keystone \nrd \nRedevelopment Partners, LLC v. Decker, 631 F. 3d 89, 95 (3 Cir. 2011) and In re Burlington \nrd \nCoat Factory Sec. Litig. 114 F. 3d 1410, 1426 (3 Cir. 1997).  In Keystone, the Court briefly \nnoted \"in considering the propriety of the District Court's ruling, this Court \"may also consider \nmatters of public record, orders, exhibits attached to the Complaint and items appearing in the \nrecord of the case.\"  631 F. 3d 89, 94 (citing Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 38 F. \nrd \n3d 1380, 1384 n. 2 (3 Cir. 1994)).  The Third Circuit in Keystone was reciting its standard of \nreview, not the standard applicable to the District Court in deciding a motion to dismiss.  That \nbeing said, the IHP's and other exhibits attached to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss are neither \nmatters of public record, orders, or exhibits to the Amended Complaint.  They are also not items \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 6 of 31 PageID: 471\nthat have previously appeared in the record in this case.  Thus, even if this were the proper \nstandard of review for this Court, these documents would still be inappropriately attached. \nTd \nDefendants use ofIn re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. 114 F. 3d 1410, 1426 (3 Cir. 1997) \nis also misplaced.  In Burlington, the District Court considered an annual report in its decision to \ndismiss plaintiffs complaint.  The Third Circuit ruled that the District Court's consideration of \nthe annual report was not improper because plaintiff s claims were based on the content of the \nannual report, thus, it was proper for them to consider its contents.  In its opinion, the Third \nCircuit clearly lays out the standard for when a District Court may consider matters extraneous to \nthe pleadings. \"[A]n exception to the general rule that a 'document integral to or explicitly relied \nupon in the complaint' may be considered 'without converting the motion [to dismiss] into one \nfor summary judgment. '\" (citing Shaw v.  Digital Equipment Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1224 (1 st Cir. \n1996)).  The important distinction between Burlington and the instant case is that the plaintiffs \nclaims in Burlington were dependent upon and relied upon the contents of the annual report.  In \nfact, the plaintiff s complaint in Burlington contained claims that relied upon the information that \nwas contained in the annual reports, so the Court found it appropriate to consider the actual \ncontent of the annual reports.  The Plaintiff s claims in the instant case are distinguishable \nbecause they stand on their own regardless of what is written in the IHP's or what the Task Force \nReport determined, thus, they are not dependent or reliant upon the documents attached to \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss.  Further, there is nothing in the exhibits attached to Defendants' \nMotion to Dismiss that would provide this Court with information that has not already been \nsupplied by the allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint.  Thus, these documents do not fall \nwithin the exception stated by Shaw and applied by the Third Circuit in Burlington, and this \nCourt should disregard these documents. \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 7 of 31 PageID: 472\nB.  PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS ARE RIPE FOR ADJUDICATION \nDespite what Defendants may wish for this Court to believe, Plaintiffs' claims do not \nhinge on any contingencies and are ripe for adjudication. Defendants' suggestion to the contrary \nunderscores their disregard for the important rights that Plaintiffs seek to pursue in this matter. \nThose rights, for the Plaintiffs, literally could mean the difference between life and death. \nIn cases where a plaintiff seeks injunctive or declaratory relief only, standing will not lie \nif \"adjudication ... rests upon 'contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated or \nindeed may not occur at all.' \"Rodgers-Durgin v. De La Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th \nCir.1999) (quoting Texas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296 (1998)).  Indeed, in \"ADA cases, courts \nhave held that a plaintiff lacks standing to seek injunctive relief unless he alleges facts giving rise \nto an inference that he will suffer future discrimination by the defendant.\" Shotz v. Cates, 256 \nF.3d 1077, 1081 (1Ith Cir.2001) (citations omitted); see also Armstrong World Indus., Inc. v. \nAdams, 961 F.2d 405, 422 (3d Cir.1992) (discussing how cOUlis should dismiss action on \nripeness grounds when a complaint seeking declaratory relief rests on the contingency that some \nfuture act will occur).  As discussed below, Plaintiffs in this case have properly alleged facts \ngiving rise to an inference that they will suffer future discrimination, thus, they have presented a \nripe claim and have proper standing to do so. \nIn essence, the Defendants argue in their Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs' Amended Complaint that Plaintiffs' claims are hypothetical since there is no \nimmediate plan to close Vineland Developmental Center and the Task Force recommended that \nDRS close two other centers.  [Dkt. #33-1 at 20-21].  Defendants also attempt to show that the \nrecommendation of the Task Force has rendered Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint unripe.  [Dkt. \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 8 of 31 PageID: 473\n#33-1 at 21].  Some courts have rejected similar attempts by parties to render a case umipe. See \nMalama Makua v. Rumsfeld, 136 F.Supp.2d 1155, 1161 (D.Haw.2001) (\"Ripeness is an element \nofj urisdiction and is measured at the time an action is instituted; ripeness is not a moving target \naffected by a defendant's action.\"). See also Travelers Ins. Co. v. Obusek, 72 F.3d 1148, 1154 \n(3d Cir.1995) (\"[R]ipeness requires that the threat of future harm must remain 'real and \nimmediate' throughout the course of the litigation.\") (quoting Salvation Army v. Dep't ofCmty. \nAffairs, 919 F.2d 183, 192 (3d Cir.l990)).  In this case, Plaintiffs have suffered adverse \nconsequences of Defendants' policies and procedures.  Plaintiffs allege that these policies have \nbeen detrimental to Plaintiffs' ability to obtain sound professional judgment by treating \nprofessionals. The decisions of the Task Force referenced by Defendant will not affect the \npolicies and procedures followed by the State's treating professionals at Vineland, and, thus, \nthese claims have not been rendered umipe by the Task Force decisions.  The Plaintiffs' claims \nwill remain ripe until this Court mandates that the policies and procedures be changed to comply \nwith the ADA, Medicaid Act and the United States Supreme Court's Olmstead decision. \nDefendants argue that \"Plaintiffs' claims hinge on a litany of contingencies.\" [Dkt. # 33-1 \nat 17].  However, Defendants identify no such contingencies, no litany, and fail to even cite \nPlaintiffs' Amended Complaint to support their frivolous proposition.  To the contrary, a cursory \nreview of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint [Dkt. #30] will show that Plaintiffs have alleged facts \nthat give rise to an inference that Plaintiffs will suffer future discrimination by Defendants. \nThese facts, as stated in the Amended Complaint, state a valid cause of action which is ripe for \nadjudication.  The alleged facts of the Amended Complaint are not hypothetical and do not hinge \non contingencies or conjecture and are completely independent of any Task Force \nrecommendations.  For example, Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleges the following: \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 9 of 31 PageID: 474\n[T]reating professionals often have routinely and inappropriately stated that Plaintiffs \nwould best be served in alternative settings that do not provide ICFIIID-level of care. \n[Dkt. #30, ~ 41]. \nFor a significant period of time from 2010 to 2012, the Defendants openly stated their \nintent to close Vineland, and in fact greatly downsized Vineland by closing one (1) of its \ntwo (2) campuses. [T]he treating professionals at Vineland continue to make routine and \ninappropriate recommendations for placements outside of Vineland due to the illegal and \nunsound policies and practices of the Defendants encouraging the closure of development \ncenters.  [Dkt. #30, ~ 42]. \nDefendants seek to compel Plaintiffs' discharge from Vineland Developmental Center to \nother settings, including non-ICF/IID-certified settings.  [Dkt. #30, ~45]. \nDefendants'  policies  and  procedures  have  interfered  with  or  usurped  the  ability  of \nPlaintiffs' treating professionals to make independent and sound professional judgments. \nThe treating professionals are now often following a political or administrative agenda \nrather than accepted professional standards.  [Dkt. #30, ~46]. \nDefendants'  policies and  procedures  have  unduly influenced or  compelled  Plaintiffs' \ntreating professionals to recommend transfer or discharge of Plaintiffs to settings that are \nnot the most appropriate for Plaintiffs' needs, solely for the purpose of conforming to \nDefendants' political policy decisions.  [Dkt. #30, ~47]. \nDefendants have precluded treating professionals at the Vineland Development Center \nfrom fully and fairly considering whether Vineland best meets the needs of the Plaintiffs, \nand  have  prevented  those  treating  professionals  from  acknowledging  the  rights  of \nPlaintiffs to receive treatment and services at Vineland Development Center or in another \nICF/IID.  [Dkt. #30, ~54]. \nPlaintiffs have not had the benefit of their respective treating professionals' independent \njudgment  about  whether  they  should  continue  to  reside  at  Vineland  Developmental \nCenter or at another state-operated ICFIIID.  [Dkt. #30, ~55]. \nDefendants  have  instructed  or  inappropriately  encouraged  Plaintiffs'  treating \nprofessionals to  include language in Plaintiffs'  individual habilitation plans indicating \nthat Plaintiffs are capable of being served in settings other than Vineland Development \nCenter, regardless of whether Plaintiffs are actually capable of being served in alternative \nsettings. [Dkt. #30, ~65]. \nThese treating professional are likely intimidated and fearful of retaliation, including the \npossible  loss  of their jobs,  and  likely will  only  be  forthcoming  with  information to \nsupport the position of Plaintiffs if protected by or compelled by appropriate discovery in \nthis case.  [Dkt. #30, ~67]. \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 10 of 31 PageID: 475\nAs is clear to see, the facts alleged in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint are not hypothetical \nin nature, do not hinge on events that have not yet occurred, including the closure of Vineland \nDevelopmental Center, and have no relation to whether or not placements are offered.  The \nallegations contain facts which indicate that Defendants' policies and procedures are negatively \naffecting professionals and their ability to provide sound professional judgments to Plaintiffs \n. regarding the least restrictive setting appropriate to each of the Plaintiffs' needs.  Plaintiffs have \nalleged that these policies and procedures are currently active and, until changed, they will \nhinder professionals from making sound judgments. \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 (a) (1 ) and (2) require only that a complaint contain \"a \nshort and plain statement of the grounds for the court's jurisdiction\" and \"a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1)-(2). \nWhen enacted, Rule 8 eliminated the archaic system of fact pleading found in state codes of \npleading applied by the federal courts under the 1872 Conformity Act.  For the past forty years, \n\"[t]he only function left to be performed by the pleadings alone is that of notice.\" 5 Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1202, at 89 (3d ed.2004); See \nalso  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S.Ct. 2197,2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).  Further, \nRule 8 contains a concluding admonishment that \"[p] leadings must be construed so as to do \njustice[,]\" conveying the liberality by which this Court should judge Plaintiffs' Amended \nComplaint.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(t). \nThe existence of standing turns on the facts as they existed at the time a plaintiff files the \ncomplaint. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,569 n. 4 (1992).  In this matter, none of \nthe allegations have been averted by the passage of time.  Plaintiffs do allege facts regarding \nDefendants' Task Force in the Amended Complaint to show the context of Defendants' unlawful \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 11 of 31 PageID: 476\nactions, however, Plaintiffs' claims clearly do not rely on the Task Force recommendations or \nthe resulting Task Force report, and Plaintiffs' claims are not dependent on any contingent future \nevent.  In fact, Plaintiffs specifically allege in their Amended Complaint at paragraph 81 that: \nPlaintiffs' causes of action are not based upon, reliant upon, or adversely \nimpacted by any recommendation or finding of the Task Force.  The allegedly \nbinding recommendations of the Task Force are merely further evidence of an \noverall plan to downsize and eventually close all developmental centers in the \nState of New Jersey. \n[Dkt. 30, ~ 81].  Likewise, none of Plaintiffs' claims are contingent on Defendants' announced \ndecisions to close or continue operating any of their Developmental Centers.  As shown above, \nPlaintiffs' claims emerge from Defendants precluding Plaintiffs' treating professionals from \nrendering independent judgments about where Plaintiffs should receive services and Defendants \nprecluding Plaintiffs from being able to give informed consent to any proposed discharge from \nVDC.  As noted in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, Defendants motivation for depriving \nPlaintiffs of those rights seems manifold, but Defendants' questionable motivations are \nimmaterial to Plaintiffs' standing or the ripeness of their claims.  It is clear that the Plaintiffs \nhave alleged facts that meet the pleading standard required by the Third Circuit and provide \nDefendants and this Court with sufficient facts that describe a ripe controversy. \nAlthough the party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court bears the burden of establishing \nstanding, \"[a]t the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the \ndefendant's conduct may suffice.\" Id. at 561.  Nothing in Plaintiffs' claims is abstract, and only \nthis Court can remedy the deprivation of Plaintiffs' rights. Doe v. County of Centre, PA, 242 \nF.3d 437,453 (3d. Cir. 2001) (\"allegation, while disputed by the County, does not constitute an \n'abstract disagreement[]' incapable of judicial resolution\") (citing Abbott Laboratories v. \nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967); U. S. ex reI. Ricketts v. Lightcap, 567 F.2d 1226, 1233 (3d. \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 12 of 31 PageID: 477\nCir. 1977) (\"Since this allegation indicates that an action taken by the prison has had a practical \nimpact on Ricketts' rights, a ripe constitutional injury is stated.\") (citing Hardwick v. Ault, 517 \nF.2d 295 (5th Cir. 1975).  Independent of any Task Force recommendation, or announcements \nand retractions from the Defendants that they will close VDC, Defendants have violated, and \ncontinue to violate, Plaintiffs' rights provided for by the Olmstead decision, the ADA, the Rehab \nAct, the Medicaid Act, and the United States Constitution.  Defendants do not dispute that they \nare recipients of federal financial assistance and therefore subject to the requirements of the \nMedicaid Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Juvelis by Juvelis \nv. Snider, et aI., 68 F.3d 648, 652 (3d. Cir. 1995); See also Helen L. v. DiDario, et aI., 46 F.3d \n325,331 (3d. Cir. 1995); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a et seq.; Rehabilitation Act of 1973 § 504(a), 29 \nU.S.C.A. § 794(a), 29 U.S.C.A. § 794; Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, § 202, 42 \nU.S.C.A. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(d), 41.51(d).1  As discussed more fully below, the \nPlaintiffs are entitled to recommendations from their treating professionals as to where Plaintiffs \nshould receive services. Olmstead v. Zimring, et aI., 527 U.S. 581,587 (1999).  Plaintiffs are \nalso entitled to decide whether to consent to discharge from VDC based, in part, on the \nrecommendations of those treating professionals. Id.  As alleged in Plaintiffs' Amended \nComplaint, Defendants have usurped treating professionals' ability to make such \nrecommendations and compelled treating professionals to conclude that Plaintiffs can be served \nin settings that are not appropriate. [Dkt. # 30, ~ 46].  Defendants further violate Plaintiffs' rights \nby ignoring, and failing to allow for, Plaintiffs' rights, as recognized by Olmstead, to oppose \nI Plaintiffs have also alleged that Defendants have violated and continue to violate \nconstitutionally guaranteed rights.  Those allegations alone suffice to satisfy standing \nrequirements and make this matter ripe for adjudication. Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, \n373-74 (1976). \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 13 of 31 PageID: 478\ndischarge from VDC. [Dkt. # 30, ~69-70]. Defendants' actions have resulted, and will result, in \nPlaintiffs' right to receive rCF/IID-Ievel services to be severely diminished or even taken away. \n[Dkt. # 30, ~62]. \nPlaintiffs have properly asserted their claims.  Title II of the ADA incorporates the \"non-\ndiscrimination principles\" of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and extends them to state and \nlocal governments. Easley v. Snider, 36 F.3d 297,300 (3d Cir.1994) (comparing 42 U.S.c. §§ \n12131-12134 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.103); See also Helen L. v. DiDario, et aI., 46 F.3d 325,331 (3d. \nCir. 1995).  Section 202 of Title II provides: \n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity. \n42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nrn Title II actions, such as this one, the Third Circuit has expressly held \"that Congress \ndid not intend to condition the protection of the ADA upon a finding of 'discrimination.'\"  Helen \nL., 46 F.3d 325, 334.  So, although only intellectually disabled individuals can receive services at \nVDC, the Defendants cannot claim that they are violating the rights of all VDC residents equally \nand therefore not \"discriminating\" against them based on their disability. \nThe ADA regulations expressly state that: \"A public entity shall administer services, \nprograms, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.\" (emphasis added) 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d)? Plaintiffs' allege that \nDefendants' deprivation of their rights has caused, and will cause, Plaintiffs to be discharged \nfrom VDC to settings that are not appropriate to their needs. [Dkt. #30, ~ 45,54,55,56,62]. \n2 This regulation is almost identical to the Rehab Act's Section 504 regulation. See 28 \nCFR § 41.51(d). \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 14 of 31 PageID: 479\nOther district courts have recognized identical causes of action asserted by residents of state-\noperated institutions for the intellectually disabled.  See Ligas v. Maram, et aI., 1 :05-cv-4331 \n(N.D. Ill., 2010) 2010 WL 1418583; U.S. v. Virginia, et aI., 3:12-cv-59 (E.D. Va. 2012) 2012 \nWL 1739165.  Defendants' motivation for depriving Plaintiffs of their rights appears to be part \nof an ideological agenda to eliminate all larger congregate settings for individuals with \nintellectual disabilities, including ICFs/IID, and discharge some of the most medically fragile \nand vulnerable individuals to settings that are not appropriate and often dangerous.  As described \nmore fully below, Plaintiffs recognize that they do not have an absolute right to receive services \nin a state-operated ICF/IID.  However, as long as Defendants continue to operate those services, \nPlaintiffs do have the right to compel Defendants to administer those services in accordance with \nwell-settled federal law.  As such, Plaintiffs have alleged facts indicating how Defendants have \nrefused to comply with the law in failing to provide Plaintiffs with professional judgments with \nregard to discharge.  This continuous failure on the part of Defendants, as described in the facts \nalleged in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint show that Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to \nsuffer, an actual harm.  Thus, Plaintiffs' claims are ripe for adjudication. \nC.  DEFENDANTS ARE REQUIRED TO ADMINISTER SERVICES IN \nACCORDANCE WITH THE SUPREME COURT DECISION IN \nOLMSTEAD, THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, AND \nTHE REHABILITATION ACT \nIn arguing that the ADA and Rehab Act do not provide for Plaintiffs' causes of \naction, the Defendants deliberately misrepresent Plaintiffs' claims and the Olmstead \ndecision to craft an argument that has no basis in fact or law.  As described more fully in \nthe section below, Defendants have falsely represented that Plaintiffs seek to \"require \nDefendants to serve Plaintiffs in a particular developmental center.\" [Dkt. #33-1, at 22]. \nPlaintiffs seek Defendants' compliance with federal law, which entitles Plaintiffs to \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 15 of 31 PageID: 480\nreceive independent recommendations from their treating professionals as to the most \nappropriate setting to receive services and, after receiving those recommendations, the \nlaw gives to the Plaintiffs a right to consent to or to oppose any recommended discharge. \nThe Plaintiffs have never claimed to be entitled to services at a particular developmental \ncenter. \nDefendants' distortion of the Olmstead decision compels Plaintiffs to provide a \nfull discussion ofthat case.  The Olmstead case was an action filed on behalf of two \nwomen with mental retardation and co-morbid psychiatric disorders, referred to by their \ninitials, L.C. and E.W.  After being admitted voluntarily to the Georgia Regional Hospital \nin Atlanta in May 1992, L.C.'s schizophrenia was treated and stabilized.  By May 1993, \nL.C. expressed a desire to leave the Georgia Regional Hospital and her treating \nprofessionals at the facility agreed that she could have her needs met in a state-supported \ncommunity treatment program.  However, L.C. remained in the Georgia Regional \nHospital for nearly three (3) more years.  E.W. was voluntarily hospitalized at the \nGeorgia Regional Hospital in February 1995 with a diagnosis of personality disorder.  By \n1996, E. W. expressed a desire to leave the facility and her therapist concluded that she \ncould be treated in a community-based treatment program.  E.W. was not discharged until \nafter litigation was initiated.  Both women argued that the state's failure to discharge \nthem to a community-based treatment program violated Title II of the ADA, the Rehab \nAct, and due process. \nFinding that L.C.'s and E.W.'s continued treatment at the Georgia Regional \nHospital violated the ADA, Olmstead created a three-prong test to determine when the \nADA \"require[s] placement of persons with mental disabilities in community settings \n15 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 16 of 31 PageID: 481\nrather than in institutions.\" Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 587.  The Court instructed that \ncommunity placement is required when: \nthe State's treatment professionals have determined that \ncommunity placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional \ncare to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected \nindividual, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, \ntaking into account the resources available to the State and the \nneeds of others with mental disabilities. \nId.  Interpreting the ADA and the Department of Justice's regulations issued under it, \nOlmstead emphasized that there is no \"federal requirement that community-based \ntreatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.\" Id. at 602.  The Defendants \nargument in the instant matter is diametrically opposed to this proposition.  Olmstead \nexpressly stated that \"nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones \ntermination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from \ncommunity settings.\" Id. at 601-02.  \"[T]he ADA is not reasonably read to impel States to \nphase out institutions, placing patients in need of close care at risk.\" Id. at 605.  In fact, \nthe Court recognized that \"for [some] individuals, no placement outside the institution \nmay ever be appropriate.\" Id. (citing and quoting Brief for American Psychiatric \nAssociation et al. as Amici Curiae at 22-23) (\"Some individuals, whether mentally \nretarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times-perhaps in the short run, \nperhaps in the long run-for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of \ncommunity settings\"); Brief for Voice of the Retarded et al. as Amici Curiae 11 (\"Each \ndisabled person is entitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that \nperson-recognizing that, on a case-by-case basis, that setting may be in an institution\") \n(emphasis added); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 327 (1982) (Blackmun, J., \nconcurring) (\"For many mentally retarded people, the difference between the capacity to \n16 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 17 of 31 PageID: 482\ndo things for themselves within an institution and total dependence on the institution for \nall of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will know\") (emphasis added». \nIn the instant matter, Defendants would have this Court conclude that Plaintiffs \nare not entitled to protect the rights that were expressly recognized by Olmstead. \nBecause Olmstead provides no support for Defendants' argument, Defendants have \nfabricated their own standard without regard to Olmstead.  In their Brief in Support of \ntheir Motion to Dismiss, Defendants state: \nIn Olmstead, supra, 527 U.S. at 587, the Supreme Court, in a \nplurality opinion, found that under Title II of the ADA, \nspecifically, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and 28 C.F.R. 35. 130(d), if a \nState's treating professionals have determined that a person can be \nserved in the community and the person does not oppose \ncommunity placement, then the State is responsible to make such \nplacement or show justification for why it need not under the ADA \n\"fundamental alterations\" provisions. \n[Dkt. # 33-1, at 25].  Conspicuously, the Defendants do not quote the Olmstead \ndecision, but rather cite to the decision and then make unfounded implications \nthat treating professionals' determinations are optional, and only if such \ndeterminations are made, is the state \"responsible to make such placement. ... \" Id. \nDefendants' fabricated standard fails to accurately represent the clear language \nused by the Supreme Court in Olmstead.  The actual language from Olmstead is \nas follows: \n[W]e confront the question whether the proscription of \ndiscrimination may require placement of persons with mental \ndisabilities in community settings rather than in institutions. The \nanswer, we hold, is a qualified yes. Such action is in order when \nthe State's treatment professionals have determined that \ncommunity placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional \ncare to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected \nindividual, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, \n17 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 18 of 31 PageID: 483\ntaking into account the resources available to the State and the \nneeds of others with mental disabilities. \nId.  Defendants' surreptitious substitution of the word \"if' for \"when\" is an attempt to \nnullify the substance of the Olmstead standard, and would render that decision largely \nmeaningless.  In the instant matter, Defendants illogical position is clear.  VDC is \nlicensed by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, and is required to comply \nwith ICF/IID regulations.  Among other things, the ICF/IID regulations require Plaintiffs' \ntreating professionals to annually assess the appropriateness of their continued residency \nat VDC. See 42 CFR § 483.440(a) et seq.; CMS State Operations Manual Appendix J \nGuidelines for 42 CFR § 483.440(a) et seq.3  Those regulations do not give treating \nprofessionals the option of determining where Plaintiffs should receive services.  Those \nregulations require treating professionals to at least annually determine whether Plaintiffs \ncontinued residence at VDC is appropriate.  There is no option for \"if' Plaintiffs' treating \nprofessionals make such determinations. \nConsistent with Olmstead, CMS has promulgated regulations and guidelines \ndescribing when transfer or discharge of a resident of an ICF/IID can occur: \nTransfer or discharge occurs only when the facility cannot meet the \nindividual's needs, the individual no longer requires an active \ntreatment program in an ICFIMR setting, the individual/guardian \nchooses to reside elsewhere, or when a determination is made that \nanother level of service or living situation, either internal or \nexternal, would be more beneficial, or for any other \"good cause,\" \nas defined below. \nMoving an individual for \"good cause\" means for any reason that \nis in the best interest of the individual. \n3 See generally 42 CFR § 440.150 and 42 CFR §§ 483.400-483.480 for the definition of \nand regulations pertaining to intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded. \n18 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 19 of 31 PageID: 484\nCMS Guideline 42 CFR §483.440(b)(4)(i).  rf any VDC resident has been, or is to be, \ndischarged, his or her treating professionals must comply with these guidelines. \nDefendants' rendition of the Olmstead standard not only contradicts the language used by \nthe Court, but Defendants' version is also simply untenable in the context of the rCF/IID \nregulations. \nDefendants' current practice of usurping treating professionals' independent \njudgments, and directing treating professionals to conclude that VDC residents should be \ndischarged without regard for the treating professionals' independent determination, \nviolates the holding in Olmstead and the rCF/IID regulations.  Defendants' failure to \nallow for Plaintiffs' consent prior to discharge independently violates those same laws. \nJust as Defendants misrepresented the language of the Olmstead decision, they \nsimilarly distort the Findings and Purpose section of the ADA by inappropriately piecing \ntogether various phrases from different subsections of Congress' findings.  The net result \nis a false premise from which Defendants argue to deprive Plaintiffs of the very rights \nprovided for in the ADA.  Defendants' willingness to strain so far to deprive Plaintiffs of \nbasic rights to safety is the same type of aberrant conduct Congress warned against in the \nsame Findings section cited by Defendants: \n[I]ndividuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of \ndiscrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the \ndiscriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and \ncommunication barriers; overprotective rules and policies, failure to \nmake modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary \nqualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to \nlesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other \nopportunities; \n42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5) (emphasis added). \n19 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 20 of 31 PageID: 485\nPlaintiffs have a federally-protected right to receive recommendations from \ntreating professionals as to whether alternative placement is appropriate and to consent to \nany such discharge.  Olmstead dictates that VDC residents and their guardians have the \nbenefit of treating professionals' judgments regarding the most appropriate place to \nreceive services.  Only after they have the benefit of that information are residents and \nguardians required to oppose or consent to continued residence at a Training Center, or to \ndischarge to an alternative setting. See U.S. v. Arkansas, 794 F. Supp. 2d 935,982 (E.D. \nArk. 2011) (In a CRIP A case brought by the Department of Justice the district court \nconcluded that the Department of Justice failed to meet its burden pursuant to Olmstead \nbecause: \"No person determined by the State's treatment professionals to be appropriate \nfor community placement has been denied community placement.\"); See also School Bd. \nof Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273,288 (1987) (\"courts normally should defer to the \nreasonable medical judgments of public health officials\"); Hanson By and Through \nHanson v. Clarke County, Iowa, 867 F.2d 1115 (8th Cir. 1989). \nLikewise, Defendants' argument ignores the right ofVDC residents and \nguardians, as recognized by Olmstead, to oppose discharge from a facility.  Interpreting \nOlmstead, the district court in U.S. v. Arkansas concluded that the Department of Justice \nfailed to meet its burden because \"[n]o resident of [the facility] has been denied \ncommunity placement when a parent or guardian has requested such a placement.\" \nArkansas, 794 F. Supp. 2d at 982; See also Ligas v. Maram, et aI., 1: 05-cv-4331 (N.D. Ill., \n2010) 2010 WL 1418583; U.S. v. Virginia, et aI., 3:12-cv-59 (E.D. Va. 2012) 2012 WL \n1739165.  In their Motion to Dismiss, the Defendants have not even challenged this \nindependent basis for Plaintiffs' claims. \n20 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 21 of 31 PageID: 486\nThe Olmstead decision cannot be twisted, as Defendants attempt, to require \ndeinstitutionalization of individuals who need the services at the facility. See Olmstead at \n605.  In Conner v. Branstad, a district court soundly reasoned that \"if Congress had \nactually intended to require states to provide community-based programs for mentally \ndisabled individuals currently residing in institutional settings, it surely would have found \na less oblique way of doing so.\" Conner v. Branstad, 839 F. Supp. 1346, 1357 (S.D. Iowa \n1993); See also U.S. v. Oregon, 782 F. Supp. 502, 514 (D. Or. 1991) (\"[P]remature or \ninappropriate community placements would result in a much higher risk of potential harm \nthan residents are exposed to at [the facility]. \"). \nDefendants have attempted to argue that Plaintiffs have not requested community \nplacement, therefore, they have not been considered for community placement at this time.  [Dkt. \n#33-1 at 29].  However, whether or not Defendants believe that community placement is \nrequested by any of the named Plaintiffs is irrelevant to this analysis.  The fact still remains that \nPlaintiffs have properly alleged that Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs with \nindependent professional judgments regarding the least restrictive environments that are \nappropriate to meet their needs.  Plaintiffs have a federally-protected right to receive \nrecommendations from treating professionals as to whether alternative placement is appropriate \nand to consent to any such discharge. Further, the Olmstead decision dictates that VDC residents \nand their guardians have the benefit of treating professionals' judgments regarding the most \nappropriate place to receive services.  Therefore, since Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts that \nindependent professional judgments are not being made regarding the least restrictive setting \nappropriate to their needs in accordance with the ADA and Rehab Act, Plaintiffs have properly \nalleged their claims.  Therefore, these claims should not be dismissed. \n21 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 22 of 31 PageID: 487\nD.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT ALLEGED THAT DEFENDANTS ARE \nREQUIRED TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN A PARTICULAR \nINSTITUTION \nDefendants have baldly misrepresented Plaintiffs' Medicaid Act claim in an \nattempt to create a strawrnan that they can knock down.  Contrary to Defendants' \nassertions, Plaintiffs have not alleged that they are entitled to receive services in a \nparticular setting.  Plaintiffs have alleged that the Medicaid Act, among other things, \nimposes a duty on the Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with \"choice of an rCF/IID \ninstitutional placement, subject to a hearing, under 42 U.S.C. § 1396n and 42 CFR § \n441.302(d).\" [Dkt. # 30, ~107] (emphasis added).  The prior ninety-four (106) paragraphs \nof Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint describe the means by which Defendants have failed to \ngive Plaintiffs that choice.  Defendants have submitted their frivolous argument to the \nCourt, but they do not cite any portion of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint to support their \nfalse representation of Plaintiffs' allegations. See [Dkt. # 33-1 at 30-33]. \nAs Defendants concede, they do have an obligation to continue to provide \nrCF/IID care for Plaintiffs as long as they accept federal funding pursuant to the Medical \nAct. See [Dkt. # 33-1 at 32 (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(15) and 1396n(c)(2)(C)].  By \naccepting those federal funds and operating their Developmental Centers, the Defendants \nhave voluntarily assumed certain obligations.  Those obligations specifically include \nproviding rCF/IID-level of services, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10) and 1396d(a)(l5); giving \nqualified individuals the choice of receiving services in an rCF/IID placement, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396n and 42 CFR § 441.302(d); and discharging Plaintiffs only pursuant to 42 CFR § \n483.440(b)(4)(i) and in accordance with the ADA and Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581,607. \n22 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 23 of 31 PageID: 488\nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), \"[a] State plan for medical assistance must ... \nprovide that all individuals wishing for medical assistance under the plan shall have \nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable \npromptness to all eligible individuals.\"  The responsible state agency must \"furnish \nMedicaid promptly to recipients without any delay caused by the agency's administrative \nprocedures,\" and \"continue to furnish Medicaid regularly to all eligible individuals until \nthey are found to be ineligible.\" 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(a)-(b) (1996).  All Plaintiffs receive \nassistance under the Medical Assistance Program and are owed these and other duties by \nthe Defendants.  Defendants ignore those clear requirements to frivolously argue to this \nCourt that the Medicaid Act imposes no duty on them to provide services to Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs have not sued Defendants to keep VDC from closing.  Plaintiffs have \nsued Defendants to stop Defendants' unlawful discrimination against Plaintiffs.  Among \nother things alleged in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, the Defendants have instructed \nPlaintiffs' treating professionals to disregard their independent judgment and instead \nconclude that Plaintiffs can be served in alternative settings. [Dkt. # 30 at 11-12]. \nDefendants' actions are prohibited by the ADA, the Rehab Act, the Olmstead decision, \nand the U.S. Constitution.  As noted in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, the Defendants \nare prohibited from using criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of \nsubjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination on the basis of handicap or that have the purpose or \neffect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the \nrecipient's program with respect to handicapped persons. [Dkt. # 30 at 23]; See also 45 \nCFR § 84.4(b)(4 ); 28 CFR § 41.51 (b )(3)(1).  Earlier this year, the Eastern District of \nVirginia assessed a motion to intervene filed by residents of state-operated institutions for \n23 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 24 of 31 PageID: 489\nthe intellectually disabled, where those residents asserted the same rights as those \nasserted by Plaintiffs in this matter. See u.s. v. Virginia, et aI., 3:12-cv-59 (E.D. Va. \n2012) 2012 WL 1739165.  That Court granted intervention and held that \"the Petitioners \nhave a significant, protectable interest in receiving the appropriate care of their choice \nand protecting their rights under the ADA.\"  U.S. v. Virginia, et aI., 3:12-cv-59 [Dkt. # 65 \nat 3 (citing Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581,602 (\"Nor is there any federal requirement that \ncommunity-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.\"))]. \nPlaintiffs have a right to receive the services they are currently provided at VDC. \nVDC offers extensive services that simply cannot be replicated in alternative settings, \nsuch as specialized clinical and professional staff trained to provide services to specific \nVDC residents, onsite health care, and systems operated in accordance with the ICF/IID \nregulations.  The services currently offered at VDC are not available in alternative \nsettings.  The provision of those services at VDC, and the lack of availability of those \nservices elsewhere, is a matter of life and death for Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have alleged \nfacts to support their claims that Defendants have not properly complied with the \nMedicaid Act by failing to provide Plaintiffs with appropriate professional judgments to \nallow for competent evaluation for placement in an institutional facility, and have thus \nproperly alleged a violation of the Medicaid Act.  Therefore, Count III of Plaintiffs' \nAmended Complaint should not be dismissed. \n24 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 25 of 31 PageID: 490\nE.  DEFENDANTS WILL CONTINUE TO VIOLATE PLAINTIFFS' \nRIGHTS IF THIS COURT ABSTAINS FROM ADJUDICATING \nPLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS \nPlaintiffs' claims cannot be dismissed based on abstention.  The doctrine and \napplication of abstention is exceedingly narrow, and cannot be appropriately applied to \nthis case, because federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation\" to exercise their \nvalidly conferred jurisdiction. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241,248 (1967).  There are \nfew \"extraordinary and narrow exception [s ] to the duty of the District Court to adjudicate \na controversy properly before it.\" Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United \nStates, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976).  The abstention doctrine evolves from those limited \nexceptions.  Koken v. Viad Corp.  307 F.Supp.2d 650, 653 (E.D.Pa. 2004).  In this \nmatter, Defendants improperly assert the Burford abstention doctrine and seek to \nimproperly apply this doctrine to this case. Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943). \nBurford addressed abstention in the context of a complex, statewide regulatory \nregime for gas and oil drilling in Texas. Id. at 320-25.  The Burford Court held that where \na state creates a complex regulatory scheme, supervised by the state courts and central to \nstate interests, abstention would be appropriate if the federal court was required to \nevaluate primarily state law issues, which would disrupt a state's efforts \"to establish a \ncoherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.\" Colorado River, \n424 U.S. at 814; see also U.S. Automobile Ass'n v. Muir, 792 F.2d 356, 364 (3d \nCir.1986) (\"Generally, Burford abstention is justified where a complex regulatory scheme \nis administered by a specialized state tribunal having exclusive jurisdiction.\").  See also \nZablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374,380 n. 5, 98 S.Ct. 673, 678 n. 5, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 \n25 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 26 of 31 PageID: 491\n(1978) (\"[T]here is, of course, no doctrine requiring abstention merely because resolution \nof a federal question may result in the overturning of a state policy.\"). \nIn stark contrast to Burford, Plaintiffs' claims in this matter specifically invoke \ntheir federally-recognized rights.  Any state administrative process, which Defendants \nsuggest should take the place of this Court, would not only be inadequate to address \nPlaintiffs' federal claims, but it would also be tainted with Defendants' ongoing unlawful \nactions. \nThis Circuit recently addressed the standard governing Burford abstention: \nWhere timely and adequate state-court review is available, a \nfederal court sitting in equity must decline to interfere with the \nproceedings or orders of state administrative agencies: (1) when \nthere are \"difficult questions of state law bearing on policy \nproblems of substantial public import whose importance \ntranscends the result in the case then at bar\"; or (2) where the \n\"exercise of federal review of the question in a case and in similar \ncases would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent \npolicy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.\" \nRiley v. Simmons, 45 F.3d 764, 771 (3d Cir.l995) (quoting New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. \nv. Council of New Orleans (\" NOPSI \"), 491 U.S. 350, 360-63 (1989)). See also Feige v. \nSechrest, 90 F.3d 846, 847-848 (3d. Cir. 1996).4 \nThe present case does not meet the Third Circuit's requirements for abstention. \nFirst, there are no difficult questions of state law here, but rather questions of federal law \nand how the Defendants are violating those laws through their policies and procedures. \n4 The Third Circuit has consistently held that Burford abstention calls for a two-step \nanalysis. The first question is whether \"timely and adequate state-court review\" is \navailable. Id. Only if a district court determines that such review is available, should it \ntum to the other issues and determine if the case before it involves difficult questions of \nstate law impacting on the state's public policy or whether the district court's _exercise of \njurisdiction would have a disruptive effect on the state's efforts to establish a coherent \npublic policy on a matter of important state concern.  Riley, 839 F.Supp. at 1127. \n26 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 27 of 31 PageID: 492\nThere is no adequate state review available for those unlawful activities.  Second, there \nwould be no disruption if this Court were to exercise federal review of any state effort to \nestablish a coherent policy .. Rather, federal review would make it easier for the \nDefendants to establish a coherent policy that protects Plaintiffs' rights and complies with \nfederal law.  Only through this Court's review will Defendants' policies and procedures \nbe made to comply with the federal law cited in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint. \nDefendants cite New Orleans Public Service Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 \nU.S. 350 (1989), as support for their argument.  However, NOPSI does not support \nDefendants' contention.  In fact, that Court specifically stated that \"[w]hile Burford is \nconcerned with protecting complex state administrative processes from undue federal \ninterferences, it does not require abstention whenever there is such a process.\" NOPSI at \n362. \nBurford abstention is only appropriate where there are complex state \nadministrative processes that would be disturbed if the federal court interfered.  Courts in \nthe Third Circuit have only granted abstention in exceptional circumstances.  For \nexample, the Third Circuit has held that abstention is appropriate to avoid federal court \ninterference with Pennsylvania's regulation of insolvent insurance companies. Lac \nD' Amiante du Quebec, Ltee v. American Home Assurance Co., 864 F.2d 1033 (3d \nCir.1988). (Court granted abstention because the state court placed the Company in state \nliquidation proceedings and a federal case would have disrupted those proceedings and \nthe regulatory scheme).  The Third Circuit has also affirmed that if a federal court has \nexclusive jurisdiction, such as in a case involving a federal question, abstention is \nimproper.  Riley at 775. (Third Circuit held that adequate review of federal claims could \n27 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 28 of 31 PageID: 493\nnot be had in state court.) \nNot only have Defendants. cited law that does not support abstention, but \nDefendants have also misstated Plaintiffs' causes of action as contained in the Amended \nComplaint.  In their Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Defendants state:  \"Plaintiffs \nallege that Defendants' offers of alternate residential placements will be so deficient that \nthey will violate Plaintiffs' due process rights.\"  [Dkt. # 33-1 at 33].  However, this \nstatement misrepresents the claims set forth in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint.  As \ndiscussed more fully above, Plaintiffs' allegations, among other things, are that \nDefendants have deprived Plaintiffs of their rights, so as to taint the underlying facts for \nany state administrative proceedings. [Dkt. #30].  Plaintiffs have pled allegations that \nDefendants have, and continue, to violate Plaintiffs' federally-protected rights.5 [Dkt. #30 \nat 19]. \nThe Plaintiffs brought this action to address serious and ongoing violations of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.c. § 12101, et seq., the \nRehabilitation Act (\"Rehab Act\"), 29 U.S.c. § 794(a), et seq., the Medicaid Act, 42 \nU.S.c. § 1396, et seq., and the United States Constitution.  This Court cannot rely on the \nState of New Jersey's administrative process to ensure that Plaintiffs' federal rights are \nprotected.  Furthermore, this is a federal question for which this Court has jurisdiction, \n5 For example, Paragraph 54 alleges \"None of Plaintiffs have given informed consent for \ntheir discharge from Vineland Development Center becaus~, among other things, \nDefendants have precluded treating professionals at the Vineland Development Center \nfrom fully and fairly considering Plaintiffs' rights to receive treatment and services at \nVineland Development Center.\"  [Dkt. 30 at 13]; Paragraph 65 alleges \"Defendants have \ninstructed Plaintiffs' treating professionals to include language in Plaintiffs' individual \nhabilitation plans indicating that Plaintiffs are capable of being served in settings other \nthan Vineland Developmental Center, regardless of whether Plaintiffs are actually \ncapable of being served in alternative settings.\"  [Dkt. 30 at 15]. \n28 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 29 of 31 PageID: 494\nmaking abstention improper. As Plaintiffs' have alleged, and will show at trial, the \nState's system for assessing and discharging Plaintiffs from VDC specifically fails to \ncomply with federal law. \nThe allegations of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint meet the requirements of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, the ADA, Rehab Act, the Medicaid Act, and the United \nStates Constitution.  Those claims are properly pled with this Court, and they include \nclaims that the policies and procedures employed by Defendants systematically violate \nthe federal rights of Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs' claims are based on federal questions, upon \nwhich this Court has subject matter jurisdiction.  State administrative reviews of transfers \nand discharges are being done in violation of federal law.  It is preposterous for \nDefendants to suggest that this Court abstain from adjudicating this matter, in favor of \nrelying on the very system that Plaintiffs allege is part of the violation.  At a minimum, \nthat system is insufficient to address systemic violations by the Defendants to provide for \nPlaintiffs' due process rights and rights provided by the ADA, the Rehab Act, and the \nMedicaid Act.  The state administrative process is limited to whether a particular transfer \nor discharge decision was in compliance with the state policies.  Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendants' policy of usurping treating professionals' decisions by not allowing \nindependent recommendations to Plaintiffs, and the Defendants' disregard for Plaintiffs' \nconsent or opposition to transfers and discharges, violates federal law.  Furthermore, \nPlaintiffs would have no effective way of asserting their federal rights in Defendants' \nadministrative hearing process.  The facts pled support this Court's exclusive jurisdiction. \nThis Court is the most appropriate jurisdiction to adjudicate whether Defendants' \npolicies and procedures are part of systemic violations of Plaintiffs' federally-protected \n29 \n\nCase 1:12-cv-02522-RMB-AMD   Document 39   Filed 03/04/13   Page 30 of 31 PageID: 495\nrights.

Christie, et. at \nCivil Action No.:  1:12-cv-02522 \nTo the Honorable Judge Bumb: \nBased upon the comments by Your Honor at the oral argument on March 18, \n2013, the Plaintiffs have decided to request a voluntary dismissal.  The Plaintiffs \nunderstand that they may be able to return to this Court if the violations of their rights by \nthe State escalate and there is more evidence of imminent harm.  The Plaintiffs believed \nthat much of the threatened harm could be avoided if the issues were addressed before \nfurther rights were violated and before transfers of individual residents were actually \nplanned.  However, the Plaintiffs have now decided to wait until the inevitable harm by \nthe State becomes more evident and imminent. \nAlthough Plaintiffs' counsel thought that a formal motion for a voluntary \ndismissal might be appropriate, the Clerk has instructed the Plaintiffs to file a letter \nrequesting a voluntary dismissal.  The Plaintiffs request that their Amended Complaint \ndated January 11,2013, be voluntarily dismissed.  The Plaintiffs will seek to restart or to \nrevive this litigation when appropriate. \nThank you for your consideration of this request. \nVery Truly Yours, \n~Q3rr \nThomas B.
