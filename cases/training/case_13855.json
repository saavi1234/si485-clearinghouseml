At the time, BSDC housed close to 350 residents. The parties then swiftly concluded negotiations on a judicially enforceable remedial agreement.</p><p>On June 30, 2008, the United States of America filed suit in the U.S. District Court of the District of Nebraska under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 against the State of Nebraska.  The United States asked the court to require that the defendants comply with federal law and ensure that adequate protections, supports, and services are afforded to residents of the BSDC.  </p><p>Specifically, the United States claimed that the care at BSDC substantially departed from generally accepted professional standards of care, exposing residents to significant risks of harm and actual harm in the following respects: providing reasonable safe conditions; providing training to protect residents' liberty interests; providing adequate psychiatric, therapeutic, and health care services; and providing adequate nutritional and physical management.  Additionally, the United States claimed that defendants failed to comply with ADA standards by excluding BDSC residents, by reason of their disability, from participating in and obtaining benefits from services, programs, or activities in an integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  Further, the United States claimed that defendants failed to ensure that BSDC residents were evaluated for placement in the most integrated setting.</p><p>On July 2, 2008, the U.S. District Court of the District of Nebraska (Judge Richard G. Kopf) issued an order stating that no hearing was required prior to the approval of a settlement agreement.  On the same day, the parties and Judge Kopf signed a consent decree.  The consent decree detailed the steps to be taken to ensure the health and safety of the residents, including protecting the residents from abuse and neglect, and taking effective steps to minimize or eliminate resident injuries and incidents that negatively impact their health, safety, and welfare.  It also included provisions for ensuring compliance with the ADA standard of serving residents in the most integrated setting appropriate to meet each person's needs. The settlement agreement was intended to remain in place until the State implemented all of its provisions, which the parties anticipated would take four years. </p><p>On August 3, 2015, seven years after the initial settlement agreement, Judge Kopf dismissed the case and terminated the settlement agreement responsive to motions from parties indicating that the State of Nebraska had fully complied with the settlement agreement. </p><p></p>",

An  order  related  to  the  settlement agreement \nspecifically  stated  that “the  settlement agreement .  .  .  shall constitute  a  final judgment \nthe  entry  of  which  shall be  deemed  for  all purposes  to  have  occurred  when  the  same  is \nrecorded  on  the  Court’s  CM/ECF  system”  and  “the  undersigned  retains  continuing \njurisdiction  over  this  case  and  the  parties  to  construe  and  enforce  the  settlement \nagreement.”  (Filing  9.)  \nSeven  years  later,  and  after  all parties have agreed  that the  defendants  have \nsatisfactorily  complied  with  the  terms  of  the  settlement agreement,  the  parties  have  filed \na  Joint Motion  to  Dismiss  (filing  114),  supporting  brief (filing  115),  and  appendices \n(filing  116)  seeking  “to  terminate  the  Settlement Agreement  (ECF  No.  10,  July  2,  2008) \nin  this  case  and  to  dismiss  the  case  with  prejudice.”   (Filing  114.)   I  construe  the  parties’ \nrequest to  be  a  motion  for  relief  from  this  court’s  July  2,  2008,  judgment (which \nconsisted  of  the  settlement agreement)  because  “applying  [the  judgment/settlement \nagreement]  prospectively  is  no  longer  equitable.”   Fed.

All  that  is  required is that the motion be made in a \n‘reasonable time.’” 11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, et al., Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2863 (3d ed. Westlaw 2015) (footnotes omitted). \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 120   Filed: 08/03/15   Page 2 of 3 - Page ID # 1605 \nRule  60(b)(5)  allows  “relief  if  it is  no  longer  equitable for  the  judgment to  be \napplied  prospectively.”  The  rule  “applies  to  any  judgment that has  prospective  effect,” \nand   it  “refers   to   some   change   in   conditions   that  makes   continued   enforcement \ninequitable.”   A  motion  made  pursuant to  Rule  60(b)(5)  “is  addressed  to  the  sound \ndiscretion  of  the  court,”  and  “on  an  adequate  showing  the  courts  will provide  relief  if \nit no  longer  is  equitable  that the  judgment be  enforced,  whether  because  of  subsequent \nlegislation,  a  change  in  the  decisional law,  or  a  change  in  the  operative  facts.”   Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2863 (footnotes omitted). \nThe  “critical question”  in  a  Rule  60(b)(5)  analysis  is  whether  the  objective  of  the \njudgment,  consent decree,  declaratory  judgment order,  injunction,  or  the  like  “has  been \nachieved.   If  a  durable  remedy  has  been  implemented,  continued  enforcement of  the \norder  is  not only  unnecessary,  but improper.”   Horne  v.  Flores,  557  U.S.  433,  448,  450­\n51  (2009)  (noting  that Rule 60(b)(5)  is  especially  useful in  “institutional reform \nlitigation,”  and  the  rule  contemplates  “a  flexible  standard  that seeks  to return  control \nto state and local officials as soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied”).   \nThe parties have  submitted  thorough  documentation  establishing  that the State \nof  Nebraska  has  fully  complied  with  the  settlement agreement.  Therefore,  continued \nenforcement  of this  court’s  original judgment (filing  10),  which  incorporated  the \nsettlement agreement,  is  inequitable  within  the  meaning  of  Rule  60(b)(5), and  relief \nfrom  that original judgment  is  warranted.   Accordingly,  I  shall grant the  parties’  Joint \nMotion  to  Dismiss  (filing  114),  terminate  the  settlement  agreement (filing  10),  dismiss \nthis  case  with  prejudice,  and  enter  judgment by  separate  document. \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  The parties’ settlement agreement, which constituted a judgment in this \ncase (filings 9 & 10), is terminated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5); \n2.

However,  on  December  22,  2009,  the  parties  filed  with  the  court a  joint notice \nof  the  resignation  of  Dr.  McGee,  effective  December  31,  2009.

The  parties’  Joint Motion  on  the  Independent Expert’s  Reimbursement \nMotion and  Disposition of the Court Account (filing  118) is granted.  Because this is \nthe  final disbursement to  be  made  to  independent expert Maria  E.

At all relevant times, Defendants have acted or failed to act, as alleged herein, under \ncolor of state law. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n14.  BSDC is an institution within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1997(1). \n15.  Individuals are confined to, or reside at, BSDC because they have been determined \nby Defendants to have mental retardation or other developmental disabilities requiring \nprotections, supports, and services. \n16.  Defendants are obligated to operate BSDC in a manner that does not infringe upon \nthe federal rights, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates and by other federal law, ofBSDC residents. \n-3-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 06/30/08   Page 4 of 9 - Page ID # 4\n17.  The protections, supports, and services at BSDC substantially depart from generally \naccepted professional standards of care, thereby exposing the individuals residing there to \nsignificant risk of harm, and in some cases, to actual harm. \n18.  The protections, supports, and services substantially depart from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care in the following specific respects, among others: \na.  the provision of reasonably safe conditions, including protection from \nabuse, neglect, and other harm, so as to ensure the reasonable safety and \npersonal security of the BSDC residents; \nb.  the provision of that level of training, including behavioral, habilitation, \nand skills training and other related programs and activities, necessary to \nprotect the BSDC residents' liberty interests, including their right to \ntraining sufficient to ensure their safety and freedom from undue or \nunreasonable restraint; \nc.  the provision of adequate psychiatric services to BSDC residents with \nmental illness; \nd.  the provision of adequate health care to BSDC residents, including \nadequate general and specialty medical and nursing services; \ne.  the provision of adequate nutritional and physical management to BSDC \nresidents; and \nf.  the provision of adequate therapeutic services, including physical therapy, \noccupational therapy, speech therapy, and other forms of therapy. \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 06/30/08   Page 5 of 9 - Page ID # 5\n19.  Defendants are obligated to provide services, programs, and activities to BSDC \nresidents consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), and the \nregulations promulgated pursuant thereto.  42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., 28 C.F.R. Part 35. \n20.  Persons residing at BSDC are \"qualified individual[s ] with a disability\" under the \nADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, 12131. \n21.  The State of Nebraska and the State of Nebraska Department of Health and Human \nServices are \"public entities\" under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131. \n22.  Defendants have failed to meet the requirements of the ADA by excluding BSDC \nresidents, by reason of their disability, from participation in, or by denying them the benefits of, \nthe services, programs, or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. \n23.  Defendants have failed and are continuing to fail to ensure that BSDC residents are \nadequately evaluated for placement in the most integrated setting; that those individual residents \nwhom professionals determine should be placed in community programs are placed in such \nprograms, when appropriate; and that the BSDC residents are served in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to each resident's individual needs. \nVIOLATIONS t\\LLEGED \n24.  The United States incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 \nthrough 23, as if fully set forth herein. \n25.  The acts and omissions alleged in Paragraphs 17 and 18 constitute a pattern or \npractice and infringe upon the BSDC residents' legal rights and substantive liberty interests and \nconstitute resistance to their full enjoyment of their rights, privileges, or immunities secured or \n- 5-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 06/30/08   Page 6 of 9 - Page ID # 6\nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and by other \nfederal law, and deprive the BSDC residents of such rights, privileges, or immunities. \n26.  The acts and omissions alleged in Paragraphs 22 and 23 violate the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and the regulations promulgated thereto, 28 C.P.R. \nPart 35, by excluding the BSDC residents, by reason of their disability, from participation in, or \nby denying them the benefits of, the services, programs, or activities, or by subjecting them to \ndiscrimination, and by failing to administer services, programs, or activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs. \n27.

The parties recognize that nursing homes are \noften not well-suited to provide needed habilitation to persons with developmental disabilities. \nThe State will develop and implement a systemic plan to develop, through the Home and \nCommunity-Based Waiver or otherwise, integrated community alternatives to nursing homes for \nall residents with unique or more intense and complex health care needs. \n36.  Each transition plan shall identify the date the transition can occur, as well as timefi:ames \nfor completion of needed steps to effect the transition.  Each transition plan shall include the \nname of the person or entity responsible for:  commencing transition planning; identifying \ncommunity providers and other protections, supports, and services; connecting the resident with \ncommunity providers; and assisting in transition activities as necessary.  The responsible person \nor entity shall be experienced and capable of performing these functions. \n37.  Each transition plan shall be developed sufficiently prior to potential discharge so as to \nenable the careful development and implementation of needed actions to occur before, during, \n1  The United States does not concede that the words \"continue to\" or \"maintain\" \nthroughout this Settlement Agreement mean or imply that the State has already been meeting \nresidents' needs in each area. \n- 13-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 14 of 41 - Page ID # 41\nand after the transition.  This shall include identitying and overcoming, whenever possible, any \nbarriers 10 transition.  The State shall work closely with pertinent community agencies so that the \nprotections, supports, and services that the resident needs are developed and in place at the \nalternate site prior 10 the resident's discharge. \n38.  The State shall update the transition plans as needed throughout the planning and \ntransition process based on new information and/or developments. \n39.  In developing the transition plans, the State shall attempt to locate community \nalternatives in regions based upon the presence of persons significant 10 the resident, including \nparents, siblings, other relatives, or close friends, where such efforts are consistent with the \nindividual's desires. \n40.  The State agrees to provide as many individual on-site and overnight visits to various \nproposed residential placement sites in the community as are appropriate and needed 10 ensure \nthat the placement ultimately selected is, and will be, adequate and appropriate 10 meet the needs \nof each resident.  The State shall modifY the transition plans, as needed, based on these \ncommunity visits. \n41.  Each individual transition plan shall establish a schedule for moni10ring visits to the new \nresidence 10 assess whether the ongoing needs of the individual are being met.  Each plan shall \nspecifY more regular visits in the days and weeks after any initial placement. \nImplementation ofTrqnsitjon Plans \n42.  For those residents who do not oppose community placement, the State shall implement, \nin an expeditious manner, the transition plans that can be reasonably accommodated, by \ntransferring each resident to an adequate and appropriate alternative community setting pursuant \nto the details set forth in each transition plan. \n43.  The State shall take effective steps to support and expand service and provider capacity \nin the community so as to better serve residents placed and to be placed in the community.  This \nshall include, but not be limited 10, developing community capacity with regard to:  housing and \nresidential services; health care and other professional services; specialty health care services; \ntherapy services; communication and mobility supports; and psychological, behavioral, and \npsychiatric services. \n44.  Based on data and information gleaned, in part, from the State's Outreach Treatment \nServices (\"OTS\") and Intensive Treatment Services (\"ITS\") programs, the State shall develop \nand implement a plan with effective steps to expand and improve expert heslth care and expert \npsychological, behavioral, and mental health services in the community for community residents \nwith complex health care needs, and/or behavior problems and/or mental illness.  The intent of \n- 14-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 15 of 41 - Page ID # 42\nthe plan shall be to better meet residents' health care, behavioral, and mental health needs in the \ncommunity, avoid crises marked by the escalation of health care and/or behavior problems, and \nto minimize or eliminate failed or troubled community placements due to poorly addressed \nresident behaviors and, thus, minimize or eliminate re-institutionalization. \n45.  To assist in this process, the State will develop and implement a plan on or before March \nI, 2009, to utilize and/or expand the State's existing electronic information system/tele-health \nnetwork to better meet the needs of persons with developmental disabilities, especially those \nliving in more rural areas of the State.  The plan shall address how to provide more immediate \nand better access to records and expert professionals, transmit lab results and radiological reports \nbetween health care and other professionals, better track quality of care, improve communication \nwith local hospitals and specialists, and generally provide better proactive care and treatment \nthrough a more seamless continuum of care to enhance resident outcomes.  The plan shall \naddress how to conduct video-conferences among various health care providers at scattered \nlocations to save time and the expense of travel, and to encourage, wherever appropriate, the use \nof video-consults/clinics between local physicians and other professionals with specialists at \ndistant locations.  The plan shall also address how to incorporate timely tele-trauma services for \nresidents in crisis.  In developing and implementing this plan, the State shall ensure that the \nsecurity and privacy of resident information is safeguarded. \n46.  The State shall significantly expand its OTS program to address unmet needs in the \ncommunity that place individuals at risk of short-term or long-term institutionalization at BSDC. \nThe OTS program shall continue to support positive behavioral change to keep individuals as \nindependent as possible, and in familiar surroundings in their homes in the community, and away \nfrom more restrictive placements such as hospitals, nursing homes, psychiatric facilities, and \ninstitutions. \n4 7.  The State shall continue to support its ITS program, but shall strengthen its focus on \nreturning individuals back to appropriate community homes promptly after a short-term stay. \nThe State shall maintain more restrictive criteria for admitting a person long-term to a \ncongregate or institutional setting after a stay in the ITS. \nMonitoring ofCommunitv Placements and Oualitv Assurance Meqsures \n48.  The State shall develop and implement a system, including service coordination services, \nto effectively monitor community-based placements and programs to ensure that they are \ndeveloped in accordance with the individualized transition plans set forth above, and that the \nindividuals placed are provided with the protections, services, and supports they need.  These \nand other monitoring and oversight mechanisms shall serve to help protect individuals from \nabuse, neglect, and mistreatment in their community residential and other programs.  The State's \noversight shall include regular inspections of community residential and program sites; regular \nface-to-face meetings with residents and staff; and in-depth reviews of treatment records, \nincident/injury data, key-indicator performance data, and other provider records. \n- 15-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 16 of 41 - Page ID # 43\n49,  BSDC residents who are placed in the community shall be served by an adequate number \nof service coordinators to meet residents' needs.  The State's service coordination program shall \nprovide for various levels of follow-up and intervention, including more intensive service \ncoordination for those residents leaving BSDC with more complex needs.  To encourage \nfrequent individual contact, residents leaving BSDC will be served by service coordinators that \ncarry a caseload of no more than 25 individuals at a time.  Service coordinators involved with \nindividuals from BSDC with more complex and intensive needs will carry a casel oad of no more \nthan 20 individuals at a time.  All service coordinators shall receive appropriate and adequate \nsupervision and competency-bnsed training. \n50.  The State shall provide prompt and effective support and intervention services post-\nplacement to residents who present adjustment problems related to the transition process such \nthat each resident may stay in his or her community residence when appropriate, or be placed in \na different, adequate, and appropriate community setting as soon as possible.  These services \nmay include, but not be limited to:  providing heightened and enhanced service coordination to \nthe resident/home; providing professional consultation, expert assistance, training, or other \ntechnical assistance to the resident/home; providing short-term supplemental staffing and/or \nother assistance at the home as long as the problem exists; and developing and implementing \nother community residential alternative solutions for the resident. \n51.  The State commits to maintaining discharged residents in the most integrated community \nsetting appropriate for their needs. Any admission or re-admission to BSDC will be considered \nshort-term.  If a resident is re-admitted to BSDC, the State shall document the basis for the re \nadmission and then conduct a prompt assessment to identifY and resolve any factors \nnecessitating the re-admission. \n52.  The State shall regularly collect, aggregate, and analyze data related to discharge and \nplacement efforts, including but not limited to information related to both successful and \nunsuccessful placements, as well as the problems or barriers to placing and/or keeping residents \nin the most integrated and appropriate setting.  On or before January l, 2009, the State shall also \ncollect, aggregate, and analyze community data for at least the past five years frcm its OTS \nprogram and its ITS program, which may reveal systemic problems or barriers to meeting \nindividual consumer needs in the coumumity. Such problems or barriers may include, but not be \nlimited to insufficient or inadequate:  housing, community resources, health care, behavior \nmanagement and services, and meaningful day activities including supported employment.  The \nState shall review this information on a regular basis and develop and implement prompt and \neffective strategies to overcome the problems and barriers identified. \n53.  The State shall regularly review various community providers and programs to identifY \ngaps and weaknesses, as well as areas of highest demand, to provide information for \ncomprehensive planning, administration, resource-targeting, and implementing needed remedies. \nThe State shall develop and implement effective strategies to any gaps or weaknesses or issues \nidentified. \n-16-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 17 of 41 - Page ID # 44\nC.  TRAINING AND BEHAV  IQRAL SERVICES. RESTRAINTS· AND \nPSYCHIATRIC CARE \nTraininr (ll!d BeJraviorql Services \nPrincipal Requirement \n54.  The State shall provide adequate psychological and behavioral services, including skills \ntraining and positive behavioral support plans, to meet the individualized needs of each resident, \nespecially those with challenging behaviom.  These services shall be developed and implemented \nto ensure and protect residents' right to training sufficient to provide each resident a reasonable \nopportunity to enhance functioning, to grow and develop, to attain self-help and social skills \nneeded to exercise as much autonomy or independence as possible, to prevent or decelerate both \nphysical and psychological regression, loss of skills and functional status, and to ensure their \nreasonable safety, security and freedom from undue bodily restraint.  To this end: \nIndividualized Assessments \n55.  The State has begun and will continue the process of conducting a new interdisciplinary \nevaluation of each resident to determine the specific areas in which each resident needs trsining. \nThese interdisciplinary evaluations shall be completed for all residents on or before January 1, \n2009, and shall be repeated for all residents at annual intervals, unless required more frequently \nby each resident's needs; residents with challenging behaviom will likely require \ninterdisciplinary evaluations much more frequently than once a year. \n56.  This interdisciplinary evaluation shall include adequate behavioral assessments \n(including an individualized, formal functioual aualysis whenever appropriate) based on the \ninput from the psychologists and an interdisciplinary team.  A functional analysis is an \nassessment of an individual's behavior that includes:  (1) a description of the behaviom(s); (2) the \ncollection of empirical data; (3) an assessment of the behavioral intensity, frequency, duration, \nand severity; (4) an evaluation of the antecedents, consequences and function of the behavior(s) ; \n(5) an assessment of any medical, nllllling, mental health or other conditions related to the \nbehavior(s) so as to determine the medical, behavioral, mental health, environmental and/or \nother factum that may be causing each resident's challenging behaviom; and (6) the development \nof skills training, behavior support, and other procedures hased upon the aualysis.  The \npsychologist's assessment and functional aualysis shall be hased on a first-hand, in-depth, \nobservational aualysis of each resident's behavior, and not primarily from data provided \npUilluant to a screening tool. \nSkills Training and Habilitation \n57.  Based on this evaluation, the State shall develop and implement a professionslly-based, \nindividualized skills training and habilitation support plan for each resident and provide each \nresident with a minimum of five holllll. per day of off-residence skills training, in the community \n-17-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 18 of 41 - Page ID # 45\nwhenever appropriate, derived from the resident's skills training and habilitation support plan, to \nmeet the individualized needs of each resident.  The skills training and habilitation support plans \nshall include real-life variables, in the community whenever appropriate, with outcome measures \nthat will be meaningful to residents with an emphasis on providing training in functional \ncontexts.  Plans shall be developed and implemented with a focus on proactive skills building \nand an emphasis on reducing the use of restrictive interventions.  Residents' needs for \nmeaningful training sball be continually met. \n58.  In developing and implementing the skills training and habilitation support plans, the \nState shall provide residents with these services in the most integrated setting appropriate for \neach individual resident.  The State shall emphasize involvement in and with the community, \naway from the BSOC campus, as much as possible and appropriate, according to each resident's \nindividualized needs. \n59.  The State shall develop and implement an initiative to significantly increase community \nintegration activities and upportunities for residents day-to-day, including: (a) community \nsupported employment; (b) community day programming; (c) community volunteer activities; \nand (d) community business and recreational outings, including but not limited to grocery stores, \npharmacies, restaurants, theaters, and places of religious expression.  This initiative sball ensure \nthat staffing, transportation, and other resources are adequate to meet the residents' needs for \ncommunity integration activities and opportunities. \n60.  The State shall develop and implement an initiative to better engage residents in \nmeaningful trsining and activity throughout each day, according to their individualized needs, \nwhen the residents are on-campus and/or on their living units.  This initiative shall make better \nuse of on-campus recreational facilities, such as at the Carstens Center. \nPositive Behavioral Support Plans \n61.  For residents with behaviors, the State shall ensure that psychologists develop and \nimplement positive behavioral support plans that include:  (I) a detailed definition and \nidentification of the specific, measurable, and objective behavior(s) to increase and/or decrease; \n(2) a description and incorpomtion of the individualized functional analysis; (3) a comprehensive \ndiscussion of how medical and/or psychiatric disorders impact behavioral problems; (4) the \nprocedures for staff to follow to decrease the occurrence of the problem behaviors; (5) the skills \nand positive, adaptive behaviors (to include replacement behaviors) that will bC taught and the \nprocedures for teaching them; (6) environmental changes to promote the development of \npositive, adaptive behaviors; (7) individualized reinforcers and/or preferences as determined in \naccordance with the needs of each resident; (8) an individualized schedule of active treatment \nactivities as documented in the resident's individualized plan that corresponds to the resident's \ntreatment needs; and (9) an adequate data collection system that includes appropriate data \ncollection procedures which, for residents with positive bebavioml support plans, shall measure \ninformation about maladaptive and adaptive behaviors and the conditions under which they \n- 18-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 19 of 41 - Page ID # 46\noccur, including, where appropriate, the frequency, intensity, severity, and duration of the \nbehaviors. \n62.  In developing and implementing these positive behavioral support plans, the \npsychologists shall adequately document their clinical fmdings and the treatment hypotheses to \nbe tested, and set forth how treatments are derived.  The psychologists shall also document their \nmtionale for using specific behavioral interventions. \n63.  The State shall ensure that psychologists write concise and simple-to-use positive \nbehavioral support plans at a level that can be easily understood and implemented by direct care \nstaff. \n64.  The State shall improve implementation ofbehavioml plans at the direct care stafflevel. \nAs part of this initiative, in conjunction with outside consultants, as appropriate, the State shall \nprovide regular and ongoing competency-based training to direct care and supervisory staff on \nhow to properly redirect residents' behaviors pursuant to each resident's plan, without resorting \nto the undue use of planned or unplanned mechanical, physical, or chemical restraints. \n65.  Both skills training and positive behavioral supports shall be developed and implemented \nas part of a resident's ovemll individualized plan.  The State shall ensure that there is effective \ncoordination and integmtion of services and treatment modalities, including psychology, \npsychiatry, neurology, nursing, medical and health care, and other needed services. \n66.  On or before January I, 2009, the State shall maintain an effective Behavior Intervention \nCommittee review process for the development and implementation of positive behavioral \nsupport plans, with an emphasis on stringent review and approval of restrictive interventions. \nMonitoring and Follow-Up \n67.  The State shall develop and implement an effective system to regularly monitor each \nresident's skills training and positive behavioml support plans.  The monitoring of the skills \ntraining and positive behavioral support plans shall produce prompt and effective follow-up \naction to ensure that:  (a) the direct care staff are effectively implementing the skills training and \nbehavior support plans, (b) the skills training and behavior support plans are effective and \nproducing training and treatment outcomes specified in each resident's plan, and (c) where the \nresidents are not making progress, the skills training and behavior support plans are modified \nappropriately and whenever necessary, and implemented promptly thereafter. \n68.  This monitoring system shall include tracking of systemic and individual outcome \nmeasures, with variables including, but not limited to:  the incidence of resident behaviors, the \nuse of restraints, the use of emergency procedures, and the implementation and monitoring of \nbehavior plans.  The State shall promptly and effectively address any systemic or individual \nproblems identified through monitoring. \n- 19-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 20 of 41 - Page ID # 47\nPriority Group \n69.  Based on the assessments and the monitoring, the State shall create a list of behavioral \npriority residents for heightened and enhanced attention and focus.  This priority group shall \nconsist, at least, of those residents who have already had a planned or unplanned mechanical, \nphysical, or chemical restraint, those residents with a dual diagnosis of mental illness, those \nresidents with significant or challenging behavior problems, as well as those residents who \nsustain or cause frequent injuries or are at risk of serious harm due to their behaviors. \n70.  In close consultation with outside consultants, as appropriate, the State shall prioritize \nthese residents for the development and implementation of alternative and/or more tailored and \nintensive protections, supports, and services, where appropriate, through augmented and \nenhanced skills training and habilitation, positive behavioral supports, mental health care, and \nother interventions and treatment modalities, including an increased emphasis on community \nliving and/or more structured,. meaningful, and integrated habilitative activities in the \ncommunity.  These protections, supports, and services shall meet the resident's individualized \nneeds without relying on the use of restraints.  The intent here is to minimize or eliminate the \ntriggers for behaviors, minimize or eliminate the behaviors themselves, and minimize or \neliminate the use of restraints. \n71.  The steps necessary to achieve such positive outcomes for the residents in this priority \ngroup may include:  daily interdisciplinary team meetings, regular contact with outside \nconsultants, as appropriate, close observation of the residents and their staff, daily competency \nbased training of staff with regard to how to properly implement needed interventions, regular \nrevision of plans and approaches, changes in the living environment, more frequent contact with \npeople in the community in normal settings, and more meaningful and engaging day activities in \nthe community. \nRestraints \n72.  The State shall ensure that all residents are free from unreasonable restraint.  The State \nshall develop and implement effective measures to minimize significantly or eliminate entirely \nthe use of mechanical, physical, and chemical restraints on BSDC residents.  The State shall \nensure that restraints are not used as punishment, in lieu of habilitation, skills training and \nbehavior support plans, or for the convenience of staff.  Any restraint used will be the least \nrestrictive form of restraint. \n73.  Restraints shall not be a part of any positive behavioral support plan and restraints shall \nnot be used as a learning-based contingency to reduce the frequency of a behavior.  Restraints \nmay only be used for medical reasons or when there is immediate risk of harm to self or others \n(i.e., to interrupt or terminate a seriously dangerous situation where injury could result).  The \nState shall revise its policy definition of immediate risk of harm to self or others to ensure that \nthe justified use of restraints is minimized.  The State shall ensure that restraints labeled as \n-20-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 21 of 41 - Page ID # 48\n\"medical\" restraints are not, in fact, used for behavioral purposes or control. The State shall \ncontinue to prohibit the use of all prone physical and mechanical restraints. \n74.  In order to minimize or eliminate the use of restraints generally, the State shall ensure \nthat the staff are adequately and appropriately implementing all aspects of each resident's overall \nindividualized plan, including aspects related to positive behavioral supports, skills training and \nhabilitation, mental health care, and integrated community living and activities.  The State shall \nensure that the supervisory and professional staff are regularly monitoring the individualized \nplans and their implementation to ensure that the plans and their implementation are effective \nand producing the desired reduction or elimination in the use of restraints.  Where plan \nmodifications are needed to address a resident's restraint usage, the State shall ensure that \nappropriate plan revisions are promptly developed and implemented. \n75.  The resident's psychologist shall begin the regular practice of reviewing, by the next \nworking day, each use of mechanical, physical, or chemical restraint (excluding planned medical \nrestraints), so as to ascertain the circumstances under which such restraint was used.  The \npsychologist will conduct an analysis of what antecedents or circumstances may have prompted \nthe behavioral escalation that led to the use of restraint.  The psychologist shall analyze at least \nthese variables:  whether the behavior plan as written and/or implemented is effective in \naddressing the resident's behaviors; whether the living environment is overly restrictive and \nsegregated; whether the living environment is overly crowded and/or fosters conflict with too \nmuch exposure to other residents prone to behaviors; whether there is adequate skills training, \nhabilitation, and/or meaningful community activities throughout the day; and whether the \nresident is receiving adequate and appropriate treatment for his or her mental illness.  The \npsychologist will then promptly develop, and the staff will implement, individualized measures \nto minimize or eliminate such antecedents or circumstances. \n76.  If any resident is subjected to three or more restraints within a 30-day period, the State \nwill convene a meeting of the resident's interdisciplinary team, including the psychologist, to \nconduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the resident's \nexisting protections, supports, and services.  This team meeting shall take place on the first \nworking day following the third restraint.  The team meeting shall include the input and analysis \nof outside consultants whenever possible. The team shall promptly develop, whenever \nnecessary, alternative and/or more tailored and intensive protections, supports, and services that \nmeet the resident's individualized needs, but that do not rely on the use of restraints.  The team \nshall make specific recommendations and shall document these recommendations in the \nresident's record, making changes in the resident's individualized plan whenever necessary. \nThese recommendations in the revised plan shall be implemented promptly and properly to meet \nthe resident's plan. \n77.  The parties anticipate that the use of mechanical, physical, and chemical restraints at \nBSDC will become a very rare occurrence. When utilized, however, staff shall take the \nfollowing steps and precautions: \n-21 -\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 22 of 41 - Page ID # 49\na.  provide immediate notification to an on-site supervisor upon the use of any restraints; \nb.  provide notification to and obtain the approval of a psychologist and/or nurse if any \nrestraint is applied for longer than one hour, and upon each hour thereafter; \nc.  ensure that a nurse provides a timely assessment that the restraint is being safely \napplied and is reasonably tailored to the resident's behavior; \nd.  provide continuous monitoring of the resident while restrained to ensure safety; ensure \nthat a nurse or senior supervisor monitors and documents the residents' vital signs, \nrespiration, circulation, and mental status at least every hour the resident is restrained; \nrelease every restrained limb from restraint, examine it for bruising and skin tears, and \nallow exercise of the limb at least ten minutes every hour; provide the restrained resident \nwith an opportwrity to eat, drink fluids, and toilet, as needed; provide every resident in \nrestraint with continuous one-to-one supervision; and \ne.  release every restrained resident from restraint as soon as the resident is determined \nnot to pose an immediate risk of harm to self or others. \n78.  The State shall ensure that staff are adequately trained on the proper use of restraints. \n79.  The State shall document each use of mechanical, physical, and chemical restraint, \nincluding the date and time of use, the events leading to the restraint, the exact type of restraint \nor procedure used, as well as the length of time it was used.  Documentation of each use of \nrestraint shall be kept in the resident's file and in a central location. \n80.  The State shall ensure that chemical restraints meet appropriate levels of approval and \noversight by a psychiatrist, psychologist, and physician prior to their administration.  Staff shall \ncollect adequate data on the effects, as well as adverse side effects, of each individual \nadministration of such medications.  The psychiatrist, psychologist, and physician shall consider \nthe data collected when making future clinical intervention decisions.  The State shall prohibit \nthe use of standing PRN or \"stat\" orders for chemical restraints. \nPucldqtric Cgre \n81.  The State shall provide adequate and appropriate routine and emergency psychiatric and \nmental health services to meet the individualized needs of each resident.  These services shall be \ndeveloped to ensure and protect residents' rights. \nAdequate Psychiatry Hours \n82.  On or before October I, 2008, the State shall procure additional psychiatry hours to meet \nthe mental health needs of the residents. The psychiatrist(s) shall be well-respected with a \ndemonstrated history of effectively meeting the needs of persons with developmental disabilities \n-22-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 23 of 41 - Page ID # 50\nand a dual diagnosis of mental illness.  The State shall provide residents with enough psychiatry \nhours to enable the psychiatrist(s ) to conduct thorough and complete evaluations, develop \ncarefully considered differential diagnoses, order appropriately tailored treatments, and provide \nregnlar and sufficient follow-up monitoring to determine whether ordered treatments are, in fact, \nworking to address the residents' underlying mental illness.  If such treatments are not working, \nthe psychiatrist(s) shall have enough time to conduct new evaluations, pursue alternative \ndiagnoses and treatments, and monitor and follow-up again.  The psychiatrisl(s) shall have \nenough time to engage in this ongoing practice for all residents, including those residents with \nchallenging behaviors associated with their mental illness.  The psychiatrist(s) shall have \nsufficient time to see all residents frequently enough such that they are receiving effective \ntreatment for their mental illness.  The psychiatrist(&) shall have sufficient time such that no \nprimary care physician, physician's assistant, or registered nurse is primarily responsible for \nproviding psychiatric follow-up care. \nPsychiatric Assessments and Diagnoses, and Mental Health Treatment \n83.  The State shall ensure that annually, or more often as needed, the psychiatrisl(s) conducta \na comprehensive assessment of each resident receiving psychotropic medication and each \nresident who has or may have a diagnosis of mental illness.  The State shall ensure that for each \nresident assessed as having mental illness, the psychiatrist(s) documents a clinically justifmble, \ndifferential diagnosis consistent with DSM-IV- TR criteria. No resident shall have a current \nmental health diagnosis that is not clinically justified in the record. \n84.  The State shall ensure that the psychiatrist(s) develops and implements an overall mental \nhealth treatment plan for each resident with a diagnosis of mental illness, and provides ongoing \nmonitoring and revision of the treatment plan.  Any treatment must comport with the mental \nhealth diagnosis.  The psychiatrist(s) shall ensure that there is proper coordination and \nintegration of psychiatric services with other services and treatment modalities, including those \nin psychology, neurology, nursing, medical and health care, and other ancillary services. \nPsychotropic Medication \n85.  On or before January l, 2009, the State shall implement and maintain the following \nrequirements with regard to the use of psychotropic medication: \na.  Prior to developing and implementing an appropriate treatment plan, the \npsychiatrist(s) shall review the current medication regimen of each resident to determine \nwhether the type and dosage of the medication is appropriate and necessary, and then, if \nnecessary, make any changes in the medication regimen. \nb.  The psychiatrisl(s) shall use psychotropic medication only as an integral part of the \nresident's individualized skills training and positive behavioral support plans. \n-23-\n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 10   Filed: 07/02/08   Page 24 of 41 - Page ID # 51\nc.  The psychiatrist(s) shall carefully review the medication regimen of residents where \ncurrent doses are above the generally accepted effective dose for any particular \nmedication. \nd.  The psychiatrist(s) shall consult with the assigned psychologist and interdisciplinary \nteam to determine whether the existing skills training and behavioral support plans are \nappropriate and whether different programs or interventions should be developed to \naddress the resident's index behaviors and symptoms so as to reduce or eliminate the need \nfor psychotropic medications. \ne.  The psychiatrist( s) shall consult with the resident's primary care physician, nurse, or \nother appropriate members of the resident's interdisciplinary team, to determine whether \nthe harmful effects of the resident's mental illness clearly outweigh the possible harmful \nside effects of the psychotropic medication and whether reasonable alternate treatment \nstrategies are likely to be less effective or potentially more dangerous than the \nmedication. \nf.  The psychiatrist( s) shall ensure that the decision-making process for titrating \nmedications up or down is clearly and fully set forth in each resident's record. \ng. The psychiatrist(s) shall ensure that there is a clear and full justification for the nse of \nany typical or \"first-generation\" anti-psychotic medications. \nh.  The psychiatrist(s ) shall take care to reduce or discontinue benzodiazepines and \nanticholinergic medications that have been used for longer periods of time than are \njustified by the resident's psychiatric diagnosis. \ni.

This memorandum outlines a success story, where the State has \nimplemented reforms that have transformed its service-delivery system for people with \ndevelopmental disabilities (“DD”), greatly expanded/enhanced community capacity, minimized \nreliance on institutional services, and generally improved outcomes for people with DD. \nI.  BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA.  Notice of Investigation, Investigation, Findings Letter \nOn May 29, 2007, the United States notified then-Governor Dave Heineman, that it \nwould be investigating the State’s largest DD institution – the Beatrice State Developmental \nCenter (“BSDC”).  From October 15-19, 2007, the United States conducted an onsite review of \nBSDC with a team of expert consultants.  Through BSDC, the State also operated “Bridges” – an \nisolated, highly-secure, and restricted residential facility – on a separate campus.   The United \nStates conducted an onsite review at Bridges contemporaneous with the visit to BSDC.  BSDC \nand Bridges were the only State-run institutions for persons with DD in Nebraska.  \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 2 of 50 - Page ID # 1274\n2 \n \nA primary focus of the investigation was determining whether the State was complying \nwith the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (Part A), as \ninterpreted in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), requiring that individuals with disabilities \nreceive services and supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. \nOn March 7, 2008, the United States issued findings detailing systemic conditions and \npractices that it found violated the constitutional and statutory rights of individuals with DD in \nthe State’s system.  The United States found that:  BSDC and Bridges residents frequently \nexperienced abuse, neglect, harmful restraints, and avoidable serious injuries; residents’ serious \nbehaviors were inadequately addressed; residents’ health care needs were often unmet; and \nresidents did not receive services in the most integrated setting as required by the ADA and \nOlmstead, with significant barriers to community placement.  \nB.  Court-Ordered Settlement Agreement \nShortly after the United States issued its findings, the parties reached agreement on a \nremedial consent decree, entitled “Settlement Agreement,” which was filed with the Court on \nJune 30, 2008.  On July 2, 2008, the Court entered the Agreement as an order of the Court. \nThe Agreement addressed all of the deficient areas set forth in the United States’ findings \nletter.  It required the State to remedy health, safety, and welfare issues at BSDC and Bridges, \nand to significantly expand and enhance community capacity to ensure positive individual \noutcomes in integrated settings.  The Agreement emphasized the need to transition \ninstitutionalized people to the community.   \nThe Agreement specified a soft target of four years for Nebraska to fully implement all \nrequirements, but specified that the Court was to retain jurisdiction until the State implemented \nall Agreement provisions and maintained implementation for one year.   \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 3 of 50 - Page ID # 1275\n3 \n \nC.   Scope of the Impact of the Settlement Agreement \nThe Agreement’s target population includes anyone who resides or resided at BSDC or \nBridges on or after the United States’ onsite investigation in October 2007, a total of 353 \npeople.1  However, the overall impact of the Agreement was not limited to this group.  The \nAgreement addresses both community services and reforms in the institutions.  Early on, the \nparties agreed that the State would not create a bifurcated DD system, where reforms and \nenhanced community capacity would only reach those hundreds who were or had been \ninstitutionalized.  Instead, the State agreed to expand community services to benefit everyone in \nits DD system, regardless of whether they had ever lived at a State-run institution.  As a result, \nthe reach of the Agreement has extended far beyond the institutions, and instead, has positively \nimpacted the almost 5,000 individuals served by community providers throughout Nebraska.     \nD.   Independent Court Monitor \nThe Agreement provides for independent oversight and compliance reporting by a court \nmonitor, called the “Independent Expert.”  Maria E. Laurence has served in this role since \nDecember 2009.  Ms. Laurence, along with a team of experts, has conducted regular, in-depth \nreviews of the State’s DD system, including onsite reviews at BSDC, Bridges, and various \ncommunity sites.  On December 3, 2014, Ms. Laurence issued her latest compliance report \n(hereinafter “IE Rep.”), which is attached as Appendix A to the parties’ index of evidentiary \nmaterials, filed contemporaneously with the instant motion and supporting memorandum.  All \n“Appendix” designations in this memorandum refer to attachments to the accompanying index of \nevidentiary materials.     \n                                                           \n1 On the last day of the investigation, there were 325 residents at BSDC and 12 residents at \nBridges.  Since then, the State admitted 12 more people to BSDC and four people to Bridges. \n \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 4 of 50 - Page ID # 1276\n4 \n \nII.  INTEGRATED COMMUNITY SERVICES \nA.  Placement/Services in the Most Integrated Setting \nThe principal requirement regarding community services is that people with DD are to be \n“served in the most integrated setting appropriate to meet each person’s individualized needs.”  \nAgreement ¶ III.B.23.  The State agreed that “all residents of BSDC meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for placement and habilitation in integrated community settings.”  Id. ¶ III.B.24 \n(emphasis added).  More particularly, the Agreement requires the State to:  \n•  provide individuals with adequate and appropriate protections, supports, and services in \nthe community to meet their individualized needs; and \n \n•  implement an effective community monitoring system to ensure individuals are provided \nwith the protections, supports, and services they need to succeed in the community.  \n \nId. ¶¶ III.B.25-42, 48-53. \nThe Agreement requires the State to place individuals into smaller community homes and \nto avoid placing individuals into nursing homes or other institutional settings, recognizing that \nnursing homes are “not well-suited” to meet the needs of persons with DD.  Id. ¶¶ III.B.34-35. \n  The Agreement requires Nebraska to expand community capacity to better serve people, \nespecially those with complex issues.  Id. ¶¶ III.B.43-44.  It stresses the need to “avoid crises \nmarked by the escalation of health care and/or behavior problems, and to minimize or eliminate \nfailed or troubled community placements due to poorly addressed resident behaviors and, thus, \nminimize or eliminate re-institutionalization.”  Id. ¶ III.B.44.  It requires an expanded community \noutreach program to address unmet needs that place people at risk of institutionalization; the \nprogram is to “keep individuals as independent as possible, and in familiar surroundings in their \nhomes in the community, and away from more restrictive placements such as hospitals, nursing \nhomes, psychiatric facilities, and institutions.”  Id. ¶ III.B.46.   \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 5 of 50 - Page ID # 1277\n5 \n \nB.  Minimized Reliance on Institutional Services and Decreased Institutional Census \n1.  Overall Decline in Institutional Numbers at BSDC and Bridges \nIn its 2007 findings letter, the United States concluded that the number of community \nplacements from BSDC had been very low and had stagnated:  in the previous decade, the State \nhad never placed more than six residents in any year in the community and the overall BSDC \ncensus typically declined only as a result of deaths or transfers to other institutional settings.   \nEntry of the Agreement effectively “closed the front door” to State-run institutional DD \nservices in Nebraska; the last admission to BSDC was on June 9, 2009.  Since entry of the \nAgreement, the State has placed 148 individuals from BSDC and Bridges into integrated \ncommunity settings – 42 percent of the total “institutional” sub-group of 353 people.  As of July \n21, 2015, there were only 116 residents still living at BSDC, a 64 percent reduction in the census \nfrom the time of the investigation.2  As we discuss in greater detail below, by June 2013, the \nState placed all of the residents of the Bridges institution into community settings and then \nclosed the institution altogether.  As a result, there is now only one, greatly minimized, State-run \nDD institution left in Nebraska.3  For a comparison that shows the declining DD population in \nState-run institutions with the increasing community DD population, see the graphs in Appendix \nB-1, attached to the accompanying index of evidentiary materials. \n                                                           \n2 Thirty-five BSDC residents have died over the past eight years. \n \n3 To make permanent the shrinking of BSDC, the State has taken the extraordinary step of \nphysically demolishing at least three large buildings on campus.   \n \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 6 of 50 - Page ID # 1278\n6 \n \nConsistent with Agreement goals, the State continues to de-emphasize use of homes of \nfour or more, preferring instead to serve people in smaller settings.  Almost 4,000 of the 4,988 \npeople served through community waivers4 live in community homes of three or fewer people.   \nAs was the case with admissions to BSDC, entry of the Agreement effectively shut the \nfront door to other institutional settings, such as nursing homes or private DD institutions, for \npeople in the sub-group.5  There are only 16 individuals from the sub-group who are now living \nin other institutions.  The last transfer to a private nursing home from BSDC occurred on \nDecember 22, 2009; the last transfer to a private institution was on May 11, 2010.   \n2.  Closure of the Bridges Institution \nIn 2005, the State created the BSDC-affiliated Bridges institution to serve individuals \nwith DD who posed significant risks to themselves or the community; nearly all of its residents \nhad previous contact with law enforcement and/or the judicial system.  Bridges was established \nas a locked, highly-restrictive institution akin to a forensic mental health facility.  Although \nBridges had close administrative ties with BSDC, it was physically located far from Beatrice, on \nthe closed campus of a former mental health facility in a rural setting in central Nebraska.   \nWhile at Bridges, the residents were regularly subjected to a high number of restraints – \nincluding multi-point mechanical restraints, as well as physical and chemical restraints.  The \nresidents left campus only rarely and they were allowed outside for only an hour or two each day \nin a small fenced area that was smaller than the yard death-row inmates are provided at the state \npenitentiary.  The Bridges residents frequently suffered injuries in confinement.   \n                                                           \n4 “Waiver” is a regulatory term describing the primary funding mechanism for community \nservices and supports for people with DD. \n \n5 In addition to State-run BSDC, there are two private DD institutions in Nebraska, each housing \na little over 100 individuals.  Mosaic, a private non-profit organization, operates both facilities.     \n     \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 7 of 50 - Page ID # 1279\n7 \n \nPrompted by the Agreement, the State developed a community re-location program for \nthe Bridges residents.  In 2011, the legislature approved $1.5 million to construct three four-\nbedroom homes in nearby Hastings that would enable them to live in integrated settings.  In June \n2013, the State moved all of the residents to the newly-constructed community homes and then \nclosed the Bridges institution altogether.     \nSince the relocation process began in 2011:  none of the individuals have had contact \nwith a psychiatric hospital; the use of mechanical and programmatic physical restraints has been \ncompletely eliminated; emergency safety interventions are rarely needed; there are far fewer \nincidents and injuries; and the use of psychotropic medications has been significantly reduced.  \nSince moving out of the institution, the former Bridges residents have been participating \nfully in community life.  All but two are involved in paid work in integrated community settings; \ncommunity jobs include working at a restaurant, detailing cars, performing janitorial work and \nlawn maintenance, caring for pets/animals, and growing vegetables for sale.  One man was hired \nrecently over other candidates who did not have any disabilities.        \nIn April 2014, the monitor and her team, along with the parties, visited the former \nBridges residents in their new community homes.  In her report, the monitor concluded:   \n•  “In stark contrast to … the Bridges program, the new homes were lovely and the \nindividuals living there appeared to be benefitting from the transition to residences that \nallowed for more opportunities to learn and practice more independent living skills.”   \n \n•  The transitions have “substantially increased their integration into the community, while \nbeing ever-cognizant of the need to do so safely.”  \n \n•  The homes highlighted the “positive results arising from the State’s firm commitment, \nsustained advocacy, thoughtful planning, and careful allocation of resources.”    \n \n•  “Particularly within the confines of a state government structure, it was no easy feat to \nbuild these homes from the ground up, and put all of the necessary pieces in place to \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 8 of 50 - Page ID # 1280\n8 \n \nallow the men to move … All of the staff involved should be commended for their work \non this project, as should the men who played an integral role in the process.”  \n \nIE Rep. at 8, 71. \n \n3.  Transition Process from Institutional Settings \nThe State has taken effective steps to comply with the transition planning requirements of \nthe Agreement in order to help reduce the institutional census and to ensure successful placement \nin the community.  The State’s program planning begins early and is premised on the notion that \neach person in an institution can live in the community with adequate services.  Transition plans, \nin conjunction with the annual Individual Personal Plan (“IPP”), detail each person’s needs and \npreferences and ensure that only community providers who can meet an individual’s particular \nneeds will be selected.  The transition process is carefully organized and includes pre-transition \nvisits to receiving community programs and close coordination with community providers.    \nThe monitor concluded that the State’s transition planning demonstrated “significant \nprogress.”  Id. at 9.  She reported that revised transition procedures have resulted in “much \nsmoother transitions” for individuals, largely due to better information-sharing and better \ntransition plans that “fairly comprehensively” identified individualized needs for protections, \nsupports, and services.  Id. at 9-10.  She found that it was “clear that there was a commitment to \nprovide prompt and effective support and intervention for individuals to ensure the success of \ntheir transition to the community for individuals moving from BSDC.”  Id. at 138-39.   \nOverall, the monitor found that the State has taken many steps to “increase community \ncapacity, and improve its oversight of the community system to ensure that individuals the \nSettlement Agreement covers are provided the protections, supports, and services they require.”   \nId. at 5.  She reported that the State built “much-needed infrastructure for the community \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 9 of 50 - Page ID # 1281\n9 \n \nsystem,” which was important, as “[m]any of the pieces necessary for a healthy community \nsystem had either been missing or were not operating in a fashion necessary to meet the goals \nand the requirements of the Settlement Agreement.”  Id.  She noted that “important changes” had \nbeen made to improve access to community services for people in need, “particularly individuals \nwith complex medical and behavioral needs.”  Id.   \nThe monitor concluded that reforms have produced positive outcomes for people, noting \nthat many “spoke with gratitude” about the State’s efforts to transition them to, and support them \nin, community settings.  Id. at 6.  She reported that the sister of a man transitioned to the \ncommunity said:  “Our family never thought his life would be this full.”  Id. at 7.   \n4.  Promoting Community Placement \nIn its 2007 findings letter, the United States found that guardian opposition was a barrier \nto placement and concluded the State did little to promote placement once a guardian expressed \nreservations, even when teams concluded that residents could benefit from community living.     \nSince entry of the Agreement, the State has implemented effective measures to \ncontinually engage guardians about community alternatives even where opposition has been \nexpressed.  The State now repeatedly re-offers community-based alternatives to institutional \ncare; this stands in stark contrast to the passive practice in place prior to the Agreement.       \nDue to the diligent efforts of its personnel, the State has succeeded in helping previously \nresistant guardians to consider, and then embrace, community transition, especially for people \nwho had been living in nursing homes.  Nebraska has also taken important steps in recent years \nto challenge some guardians who were negligent or not acting in the best interests of their wards.  \nThe State’s actions in this regard directly resulted in a number of individuals being able to move \nfrom an institution to a community home.   \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 10 of 50 - Page ID # 1282\n10 \n \nThe monitor concluded that the State had undertaken “significant efforts” to educate \nindividuals and guardians about community alternatives.  Id. at 67.  She reported that “it was \nclear that [State personnel] were making regular contact with family members/guardians, and \noffering information regarding community options.”  Id. at 63.  She found it “positive” that the \nState revised guidelines to prompt teams to “address actions that could be helpful in individuals \nand guardians learning more about community options that could meet their needs.”  Id.  \nC.  Significantly Increased Community Capacity \nIn its findings letter, the United States concluded that Nebraska lacked sufficient capacity \nin the community, particularly for people with complex health or behavioral needs.   \n1.  Continuous and Significant Budget Increases for Community DD Services \nSince entry of the Agreement, the State has made a concerted and sustained effort to \nexpand community DD services throughout Nebraska in order to ensure that adequate service \ncapacity exists to meet outstanding needs.  At the recommendation of the State’s DD agency, the \nGovernor consistently sought, and the legislature consistently provided, significant new funding \nto expand the scope and availability of community DD services.  This funding allows the State to \nserve more people well, in integrated settings, than in congregate settings like BSDC. \nAnnual State expenditures on community DD services and supports basically doubled \nduring the life of the Agreement – from $72.9 million to $145.5 million – representing an \nadditional $72 million dollars per year for community-only initiatives than was available before \nentry of the Agreement.  These are state-only dollars.  In addition, Nebraska receives about a 50 \npercent federal match through the Medicaid program, so the overall increase in community \nfunding is about twice the state-budgeted amount.  For a table and graph showing annual \ncommunity service budget amounts during the life of the Agreement, see Appendix B-2.   \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 11 of 50 - Page ID # 1283\n11 \n \nThe increased spending in the community is cost-effective.  In 2014, the average annual \ncost per person at the BSDC institution was $393,470; given the ever-declining BSDC census, \nthis cost figure has increased markedly since 2007.  By contrast, the 2014 average annual per \nperson cost of services through the comprehensive community DD waiver was just over $58,000; \nthis figure has decreased since 2007.  See Appendix B-3.  Thus, today, it costs about six times \nmore on average to serve someone at BSDC than in the community on the comprehensive DD \nwaiver. 6  This is a “win-win” situation where Nebraska is now serving more people in better, \nmore integrated settings that comply with the ADA and Olmstead for less money on average per \nperson than if the State had continued with or pursued more institutional alternatives.             \nIn general, the increased funding has expanded community services, improved their \nquality, and provided more effective oversight of service-delivery.  More specifically, the \nfunding increases ensured that BSDC/Bridges residents could move to the community when they \nchose, increased reimbursement rates for community services to better meet individual needs, \nremoved a significant number of people from the State’s DD waitlist, helped ensure that high \nschool graduates with DD receive day services, and enabled the State to implement its pilot ward \npermanency project to meet the needs of at-risk DD youth and to avoid institutionalization. \nThe additional community appropriations today make a positive impact in the lives of \nabout 5,000 people with DD who need integrated services (4,988 on average in 2014).  Since the \nUnited States’ investigation, the number of people who are on the comprehensive DD waiver and \nalso get residential services has increased by 45 percent (from 2,391 in 2007 to 3,472 today), and \n                                                           \n6 This is necessarily an estimate as the waiver cost does not include certain expenses for health \ncare which are included in the cost figures for BSDC. \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 12 of 50 - Page ID # 1284\n12 \n \nthe number of people on (or about to be on) the day waiver has increased 31 percent (from 748 in \n2007 to 979 today).   \n2.  Revised Waiver Rate Methodology Implemented with Significant Additional Funding \nAn important aspect of expanding and enhancing capacity in the community is ensuring \nthat rates within the waiver – the primary funding mechanism for community services for people \nwith DD – are adequate to meet individual needs and preferences.  This addresses immediate \nneeds and better ensures sustainability going forward.  On July 1, 2014, the State implemented a \nnew rate methodology with the additional funding referenced above, that, for the first time, \neffectively provides those on the waiver with adequate services to meet individual needs.  The \nmonitor concluded this was a “substantial effort” to address outstanding issues.  IE Rep. at 6.   \nThe State also changed set amounts to individualized service budgets that now enhance \nflexibility and facilitate access to needed services and supports.  In essence, individuals now get \nan individualized budget amount and can spend it flexibly on the services they need and prefer.     \n3.  Community DD Waitlist \nFor the period July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2012, the State expanded funding to \nserve people with DD on the waitlist, enabling the State to offer DD services to 2,470 people on \nthe waitlist, approximately 1,680 of whom accepted services.  The State has also been taking \nmore aggressive and expansive steps to identify people earlier, extend eligibility to more people, \nand add people to the waitlist before they need services.   \n4.  Waiver Enhancements – Expanded Community Options and Improved Oversight \nIn 2011, the State revised its waivers to expand the services available to individuals in the \ncommunity.  The State included provisions to add flexibility, to add non-specialized services, \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 13 of 50 - Page ID # 1285\n13 \n \nand to provide more person-centered practices to allow people with DD to work and participate \nin their communities as fully as possible.   \nIn 2010, as part of an overall effort to centralize oversight, the State began to revise its \nfragmented regulatory structure to create a comprehensive set of community DD waiver \nregulations with more of a focus on outcomes; in doing so, it incorporated the input of \nstakeholders, emerging trends in service delivery, a focus on person-centered outcomes, as well \nas the requirements from the Agreement.  While the regulations were under consideration, over \nfour dozen national and international DD professionals praised them for embodying standards of \ncare that would eliminate restraints and provide meaningful days.  On July 16, 2011, the State \nissued its new regulations.   \nThe monitor reported that the new regulations provide the State with a “wide array of \nactions to assist or compel providers to comply” with the regulations and to ensure that providers \nimmediately address issues related to individuals’ health and safety.  Id. at 142. \n  During the current year, the State has worked on drafting regulatory changes to conform \nto the new home and community-based services rule from the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (“CMS”), which imposes stricter requirements on jurisdictions with regard to \nwhat constitutes a community setting.  On December 1, 2014, the State submitted its transition \nplan to CMS.  In implementing the plan, the State commits to minimize or eliminate residential \ncommunity settings serving four or more people, as well as sheltered workshop settings.   \n5.  Expanded Number of Community Providers \nTo meet the terms of the Agreement and the increased demand for community DD \nservices throughout Nebraska, the State has made significant efforts to expand DD provider \ncapacity in the community.  Community-based “specialized” providers deliver the majority of \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 14 of 50 - Page ID # 1286\n14 \n \ncommunity services to individuals with DD.  Prior to 2009, there were 25 specialized providers \ncertified in Nebraska.  Since then, the State has certified an additional 35 such providers – well \nover a 100 percent increase – who operate a total of 87 certified community programs.      \nThe State has also implemented measures to enhance “non-specialized” services and \nsupports to promote better access to services and opportunities in the community, obtain or \nmaintain employment in truly integrated community settings, assist individuals to develop self-\nadvocacy skills, assist individuals to identify and sustain a personal support network in the \ncommunity, and help with household activities necessary to maintain independence at home.   \nIn her report, the monitor concluded that a sufficient “array of providers was available \nthat had the capacity to provide housing and residential services to individuals with varied \nneeds,” that there was  an “appropriate range of [community] alternatives” allowing providers to \nserve individuals with a “wide range of support needs,” that  “the range of community living \nalternatives appeared to continue to expand, offering a variety of available levels of support to \nmatch the needs of individuals,” and that the homes she visited were “integrated into \nneighborhoods, providing the opportunity for individuals to be members of communities, as well \nas to participate in household activities.”  Id. at 66, 70, 71.    \n6.  Expanded Community Capacity to Address Complex Health Conditions \nTo improve community capacity in health care to better meet individualized needs and to \ncomply with the terms of the Agreement, Nebraska has taken a number of important steps.   \na.  New Accessible Community Homes \nIn March 2009, the State contracted with a provider to build and operate 11 community \nhomes across Nebraska to serve dozens of people with both DD and complex health care issues; \nthe State’s community system previously lacked sufficient capacity to address such needs.   \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 15 of 50 - Page ID # 1287\n15 \n \nb.  Health High-Risk Screening Tool \nSince entry of the Agreement, the State has implemented a health high-risk screening tool \nwith a prioritization matrix to identify individuals with DD in the community who have \nsignificant medical issues.  This tool helps the community teams to identify areas of risk so that \nthey can better address outstanding needs, obtain additional health services and supports, and/or \nobtain expert consultation.     \nIn 2011, the State screened all individuals with DD in the community who were receiving \nState services and began screening all individuals who enter the State’s DD system, as well as all \nindividuals who experience a change in health status.  After screening, the State disseminates to \ncommunity providers information related to individuals’ needs.      \nc.  Traveling Clinical Review Team \nIn April 2012, the State created a community medical/clinical review team of two health \nprofessionals to assess at-risk individuals in the community to determine whether they were \ngetting adequate health care.  This team made onsite visits, reviewed services, made \nrecommendations for modified treatment, and established a follow-up system to address the \nimplementation of recommendations.   \nThe team found that the majority of individuals in the community received appropriate \nprimary health care, but that there were gaps and inconsistencies in illness prevention, early \nrecognition practices, follow-up on laboratory testing, and timely referral to specialists.  The \nteam also found some training deficits.  The team report called for enhanced training, \nstandardization of health support practices and guidelines, allocation of funding for health \nsupport based on individualized needs, regular monitoring, and continuous quality improvement.  \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 16 of 50 - Page ID # 1288\n16 \n \nThe team’s mandate was originally the group of individuals placed from BSDC, but has \nexpanded to include a larger group of people with DD in the community.  Individuals are \nprioritized based on hospital contacts, other health outcome criteria, and the results of the health \nrisk screens, with those with the highest risk scores addressed first.   \nThe team provides consultation and technical assistance to community provider agencies \nto improve health care services.  They generate written findings on medical, nursing, and clinical \ncare, and recommend changes in care when necessary.  Their reports address individual needs \nand help build awareness of critical systemic issues, unmet needs, and what actions should be \ntaken to address these needs.  The State’s chief DD medical officer reviews all reports, ensuring \nthat the system and leadership know the most pressing health care issues, as well as the people \nmost at risk.  The State sends the reports to the individuals’ community teams.  The team then \nfollows up to determine if the teams have any questions or need additional technical assistance.     \nThe monitor reviewed several team reports and found them to be “very comprehensive \nand individualized to meet each individual’s specific health needs.”  Id. at 92.  She confirmed the \nrecommendations were tracked and implemented, and noted they often produced “positive \noutcomes.”  Id.  She found that this process provided a “quality check” and that it expanded \n“community capacity for providing health care to individuals with complex medical needs.” Id.    \nThe monitor concluded that the knowledge and skill of the team professionals were \n“welcome additions” to the State’s DD system and that State community personnel were \n“seeking and using their expertise.”  Id. at 95.  She reported that the team provides a “resource” \nto assist State personnel and community providers implement systems to provide consistent and \nthorough health care oversight and that it was “evident” that the State’s team had given \ncommunity providers “significant assistance and information” that contributed to improved \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 17 of 50 - Page ID # 1289\n17 \n \noutcomes.  Id. at 81, 95.  She concluded that continued use of the team will be “invaluable in \nensuring appropriate health supports are provided” to those in need in the community.  Id. at 95.     \nd.  Specialized Training and Services for Physical and Nutritional Support Needs \nFor years, the State struggled to provide adequate physical and nutritional supports \n(“PNS”) to individuals in the community; the monitor had called this a “significant concern.”  Id. \nat 13.  By 2014, she reported that the State was starting to take “effective steps” to expand the \ncapacity and expertise of community providers and clinicians through the planning and provision \nof PNS community-based training and clinical instruction.  Id. at 83. \nThe monitor concluded that, although more needed to be done, the statewide PNS \ntraining will enhance the knowledge base of community providers and clinicians to better \nsupport individuals living in the community or preparing to move to the community.  She \ndescribed proposed PNS training initiatives as “impressive.” Id.  She concluded that the training \n“move[s] the State forward in expanding the capacity of community providers and clinicians in \ntheir knowledge of PNS and implementation of appropriate PNS plans for individuals.”  Id. at \n85-86.  She reported that although more work was needed, community providers had now begun \nto implement individual-specific procedures to provide direct care staff with written instructions \nin providing supports for people during mealtimes, bathing, transfers, medication administration, \nand oral care.  Id. \ne.  Health Care Curriculum and Training for Community Providers \nIn 2012, the State developed a video-based health supports curriculum to help community \nstaff meet the health care needs of people with DD in the State’s system, especially those with \ncomplex conditions.  The State has made the full curriculum available to all community \nproviders in Nebraska at no cost.  The training materials are comprehensive, specific for people \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 18 of 50 - Page ID # 1290\n18 \n \nwith DD, and easy to read for non-clinical staff.  The State has provided training to over 260 \ncommunity staff on how to identify and respond to individual health conditions and emergencies.  \nThe monitor concluded that the curriculum was a “valuable resource.”  Id. at 82.   \nf.  Other Community Health Care Initiatives \nThe State is expanding a tele-health network for underserved areas.  Community staff can \naccess the network at many local hospitals and the regional public health clinics across \nNebraska.  The network is used mainly for psychiatry and neurology consultations. \n7.  Expanded Community Capacity to Address Complex Behavioral Conditions \na.  Intensive Mobile Community Behavioral Services  \n \nIn its findings letter, the United States reported that the State operated a limited \ncommunity outreach program out of offices on the BSDC campus, to help keep people with \nbehavior problems or mental health issues in the community and away from long-term \ninstitutionalization.  The United States recognized that this mobile program played a positive role \nin helping to maintain community tenure, but also noted that the demonstrated capacity of the \nprogram was very small, helping only a couple dozen people per year across Nebraska.   \nThe State gradually replaced the BSDC-based outreach program with six mobile \nbehavioral consultation teams in the community – three in Omaha, two in Lincoln, and one in \nKearney (the geographic middle of the state) – targeting individuals across Nebraska who have \nDD and complex behavioral/mental health issues.  These mobile teams work closely with \nindividual teams onsite at community programs to tailor remedial steps to meet individuals’ \nneeds.  They provide prompt response to individual behavioral situations with greater flexibility \nto better meet the needs of each person and situation.  A primary goal of the mobile service is to \nreduce contact with psychiatric hospitals, local hospital emergency departments, and other \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 19 of 50 - Page ID # 1291\n19 \n \nrestrictive settings.  The six teams provide effective statewide coverage; teams can get to almost \nall individuals in need within one hour.   \nThe monitor concluded that the mobile team service “appeared to assist individuals to \nmaintain their services in community settings, while assisting community providers to improve \nthe services they provided.”  Id. at 14.  She applauded the State for the teams’ focus on efforts to \n“build providers’ capacity for behavioral treatment planning and implementation.”  Id.  She \nfound that the team was “providing valuable input that was beneficial to individuals and \ncommunity providers” and that mobile services yielded “positive” results.  Id. at 72, 88.    \nb.  Community-Based Short-Stay Crisis Home \nIn its findings letter, the United States reported that the State operated a small crisis \ncenter – the Intensive Treatment Services unit – on the BSDC campus for individuals living in \nthe community who were experiencing acute behavioral or mental health episodes.      \nA few years after entering into the Agreement, the State closed the crisis unit on the \nBSDC campus.  In its place, the State opened a small, dedicated, short-stay crisis stabilization \nprogram in a community home.  As with the mobile teams, this home exists to prevent \nindividuals with DD in crisis from having contact with hospital emergency rooms, psychiatric \nhospitals, and other restrictive settings.   \nThis home is intentionally small – it serves only three individuals at any given time.  As \nwas intended, individuals placed in this home generally stay only a short time before being \nreturned to permanent community homes.       \nThe monitor concluded that this crisis home “was meeting the need for this type of \nsupport” and that the State was prepared to create additional capacity if needed.  Id. at 97.      \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 20 of 50 - Page ID # 1292\n20 \n \nc.  Other State Initiatives for People with Complex Behaviors/Mental Illness \nThe State has undertaken other initiatives to better address the needs of those with DD \nand complex behavior issues and/or mental illness in the community, such as providing intensive \nface-to-face, hands-on training for community providers at various locations across Nebraska to \nassist them to conduct adequate functional assessments and develop effective behavior plans.  \nAs a result, the monitor concluded that functional assessments and behavior plans in the \ncommunity have continuously improved.  She found that safety plans for individuals were \n“generally improved,” and were often “extensive and detailed.”  Id. at 76.  She encouraged the \nState to continue to provide training and technical assistance to community providers to resolve \noutstanding behavioral issues.  Id. at 14, 76, 243.  The State pledges to do this going forward.   \nd.  Psychiatric Care \nThe State has taken a number of steps to expand community capacity to meet the needs of \nthose with DD and mental illness.  The State sent its clinical team to review and re-assess high-\nrisk individuals to address lingering concerns associated with polypharmacy or high doses of \npsychotropic medication.  The monitor noted that the team’s suggestions were “helpful” to \ndelivery of appropriate psychiatric care to meet mental health needs.  Id. at 78-80.  The State has \nsince engaged in additional outreach to community providers to offer more technical assistance.     \nManaged Care - The State recently transferred behavioral/mental health services to a \nmanaged care entity for individuals receiving Medicaid.  The shift to managed care has the \npotential to provide better oversight of, and to improve services delivered by, community mental \nhealth clinicians.  Through the managed care organization, the State is developing measures to \nimpose comprehensive reforms throughout the community through adoption of treatment \nprotocols endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association that would prompt better treatment \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 21 of 50 - Page ID # 1293\n21 \n \nand improved outcomes.  The State pledges to continue to work closely with the managed care \nentity to impose more stringent requirements on community mental health clinicians, especially \nin those cases where individuals are receiving multiple psychotropic medications.  The monitor \nconcluded that this initiative has the potential to improve coordination of care, provide better \noversight of the use of psychotropic medication, prompt additional opportunities for training, and \nimprove the ability to use data effectively.  Id. at 78, 80.   \n8.  Community Incidents and Investigations of Serious Incidents \nIncident Reporting – In recent years, the State recognized that community providers \ncompleted incident reports inconsistently and with variable quality.  This limited the State’s \nability to develop and implement reforms.  To address this, the State developed an electronic \nincident reporting system with a limited roll out in April 2011, and full implementation on \nJanuary 1, 2014.  The electronic system is straightforward and easy to use; it enables staff to \nrecord incidents more quickly, more accurately, and more consistently than was possible before \nwith paper reporting.  The electronic system provides more quality information more quickly to \nState leadership and staff, thereby enabling the State to take more prompt and more tailored \nremedial measures to address outstanding concerns.   \nThe monitor characterized the new electronic system as a “notable improvement.”  Id. at \n126.  She concluded that this system now provides the State with a tool to “collect information in \na timely manner [and] to aggregate information, and generate reports that would assist in the \nanalysis of incident and other data”; it also provided “easier access to and use of incident data by \na number of audiences, including State staff … as well as community providers.”  Id. at 126-27.  \nThe State has improved its follow up regarding critical incidents, now taking appropriate \nsteps in a timely manner.  The monitor found that although more needed to be done, it was \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 22 of 50 - Page ID # 1294\n22 \n \n“positive” that the State’s technical assistance staff had begun to use incident data to identify \nindividuals with high numbers of behavior-related incidents over a 60-day period.  Id. at 129.  \nFor individuals with over 10 incidents, the State completes additional analysis to determine if the \nperson needs a specialty consultation; the monitor labeled this a “good use of incident data.”  Id.   \nInvestigations – There were recurring problems with timeliness and follow-through \nassociated with community investigations of serious incidents.  The State was not sufficiently \nnotifying community providers in a timely manner so they could take necessary action to protect \nindividuals while the investigation was being completed, including removing the alleged \nperpetrator from direct contact with individuals; in addition, the State was not giving providers \nthe results of the investigations so that the providers could implement remedial measures.  As a \nthreshold matter, existing definitions of abuse, neglect, and exploitation failed to include \nimportant events where there was no physical injury; as a result, the State was not investigating \nmany allegations.     \nPrompted by the Agreement, the State began to implement a series of training and other \ninternal reforms that caused it to investigate certain matters it would have not investigated in the \npast.  The monitor reported that these efforts also produced investigations of better quality; she \nencouraged the State to take additional steps, such as improving methodologies and properly \nreconciling evidence to support findings.  Id. at 15-16, 136.  At the time of the monitor’s most \nrecent visit, the State was in the final stages of implementing an on-call system to more promptly \nnotify community providers of allegations and direct them to remove alleged perpetrators from \ndirect contact with individuals pending the outcome of the investigation.  The State is also now \nstarting to initiate investigations the first day, and to notify providers of the results of \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 23 of 50 - Page ID # 1295\n23 \n \ninvestigations.  The State is also implementing a quality review of investigations that should \nprompt further improvements.   \nIncidents – Even though the State is facilitating receipt of more types of incidents than \nbefore the Agreement and investigating serious incidents more thoroughly, incidents in the \ncommunity are appropriately low among formerly institutionalized individuals.  In this sub-\ngroup, for over a year now, there have been no recorded instances of seclusion, mechanical or \nchemical restraint, or physical restraint outside the context of an approved safety plan, and there \nhas been minimal use of physical restraint or separation.  During this period, there were no \nincidents of attempted theft or larceny, and only a handful of incidents per month involving \nalleged exploitation, property damage, or peer-to-peer aggression.  Only 13 individuals last year \nfrom the sub-group had contact with law enforcement and there were no arrests; almost half of \nthe contacts were initiated by the person claiming to be upset, not prompted by staff \nimproprieties.  Looking at the broader context, in 2013, at all licensed community sites, the State \nreported a total of 323 serious incident allegations, with only 35 substantiated for the entire year.   \n9.  Enhanced Community Services to Prevent Contact with Correctional Facilities \nIn January 2010, the State created the Nebraska Family Help Line to establish a single \npoint of contact to make it easier for families to obtain assistance when they are having a family \ncrisis.  This 24/7 line is a collaborative effort within state government and it includes the active \nparticipation of the State’s DD agency.  Last year, about a dozen children with DD were referred \nthrough the help line.             \nThe State has developed and implemented a robust plan to divert from jail or prison, \nindividuals with DD who come into contact with the judicial system.  In recent years, the State’s \nDD agency has done extensive outreach to county attorneys across Nebraska to educate them \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 24 of 50 - Page ID # 1296\n24 \n \nabout DD issues.  As a result, it is common for these attorneys to contact the DD agency to \nintervene when someone suspected of having DD is implicated in a criminal matter.  If the \nperson is willing to accept DD services, the DD agency then assumes responsibility going \nforward and, typically, further judicial action/incarceration is avoided.   \nWhen individuals decline to accept DD services, the State proceeds pursuant to the state \nDevelopmental Disabilities Court-Ordered Custody Act (“DDCOCA”), first operationalized a \nyear after entry of the Agreement.  In this circumstance, when an individual has been adjudicated \nas a person “in need of court-ordered custody and treatment” under the Act, the State Department \nof Health and Human Services is required to evaluate the individual and develop a plan for \ncustody and treatment in the “least restrictive alternative.”   \nIn FY14, the State diverted almost a dozen individuals with DD from correctional \nfacilities and transitioned two individuals out of correctional facilities and into community \nhomes.  Since the inception of the program in 2009, the State has spent over $4.2 million on this \ninitiative and has diverted about two dozen people with DD.  Not only has the State prevented \nincarceration for an extended or indefinite stay, it has succeeded in providing these people, \nalmost without exception, with community homes and services.  This is a better outcome for \npeople with DD and it eliminates the cost of incarceration.   \nThe State’s targeted caseload team, first operationalized in 2014, supports individuals \nwith significant health care and/or behavioral/mental health needs, some of whom are involved \nin court proceedings.  It is the team’s responsibility to ensure that all individuals adjudicated \nunder the DDCOCA receive appropriate services and supports in the community to ensure their \nhealth and safety so that unnecessary institutionalization does not occur.   \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 25 of 50 - Page ID # 1297\n25 \n \n10. Enhanced Community Capacity to Provide Meaningful Integrated Day Activities \nIncluding Supported Employment \n \nThe Agreement requires the State to significantly increase daily community integration \nactivities, including supported employment, community volunteer activities, and community \nbusiness and recreational outings.  Agreement ¶ III.C.59.  The Agreement emphasizes that day \nskills training and related activities are to be provided in the community whenever appropriate:  \n“[t]he State shall emphasize involvement in and with the community, away from the BSDC \ncampus, as much as possible and appropriate, according to each resident’s individualized needs.”  \nId. ¶¶ III.C.57, 58.   \nIntegrated Community Employment - Prompted by the Agreement, Nebraska is now \ncommitted to integrated employment for people with DD.  Since its entry, the State has enhanced \nemployment service options, activities, and job experiences with a focus on paid employment in \nintegrated community settings in the general workforce; funded more job training and job \ncoaching to enable individuals to gain skills and to become more independent in integrated \nsettings; changed services and supports to better reflect individualized goals; and provided high \nschool graduates with more options to live and work in their community.  \nThe State’s 2015 Employment First policy emphasizes that “employment in integrated \nsettings within the community should be the priority service option.”  The policy starts with a \npresumption of employability for all and elevates the level of priority of the “career” section of \nthe person’s individual plan.   \nIn January 2011, the State revised its two adult waivers to provide greater opportunities \nfor individuals with DD to explore integrated employment.  The State now offers vocational \nplanning focused on career planning, job exploration, and job skill development to better enable \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 26 of 50 - Page ID # 1298\n26 \n \nindividuals with DD to have a normal and successful job search experience.  Once employment \nis obtained, the State offers integrated community employment services to provide job coaching \nand other supports.     \nIn March 2013, the State surveyed its community personnel, asking them to compare the \nservices people living in the community received in 2007, the year of the United States’ findings \nletter, to the services and supports they were receiving now.  Survey results revealed notable \nimprovements with regard to employment, volunteer, and recreational activities in integrated \ncommunity settings.      \nThe State has significantly increased the number of people with DD who are employed in \nintegrated settings, as well as the number of hours they are working there.  From 2007 to 2013, \nthe total number of people with DD who worked in integrated settings increased by over 61 \npercent from 651 people to 1,050 people.  See Appendix B-4.  As of 2013, the State estimated \nthat over 23 percent of all eligible people with DD in its system were working in an integrated \nsetting.  From 2007 to 2013, the number of people working over 10 hours per week in integrated \nsettings increased by 70 percent, and the number of people working over 20 hours per week \nincreased by 77 percent.   \nThis is true employment where people with DD are earning minimum wage or above and \nare being paid directly by the business in an integrated setting – not in sheltered workshops.  The \nState defined “integrated setting” as a setting in which persons with disabilities interact with \npersons without disabilities who are not paid to provide services and the interactions are to the \nsame extent that people without disabilities have in comparable situations.   \nIntegrated Community Volunteer Activities - The State has made significant strides in \ninvolving people with DD in integrated volunteer activities that enable them to explore and \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 27 of 50 - Page ID # 1299\n27 \n \nexperience their community, learn skills that may be transferable to future employment, \ncontribute meaningfully to their community, and build self-esteem.  From 2007 to 2013, the total \nnumber of people with DD who volunteered in integrated settings increased by 185 percent from \n380 people to 1,082 people.  See Appendix B-4.  During this period, the number volunteering \nover 10 hours and over 20 hours per week each increased by over 600 percent.        \nIntegrated Community Recreational Activities - There has been similar progress with \nregard to participation in integrated recreational activities.  From 2007 to 2013, the total number \nof people with DD who were engaged in recreational activities in integrated settings increased by \nover 96 percent from 1,510 individuals to almost 3,000 individuals.  See Appendix B-4.  The \nnumber involved in over 10 hours of community recreation per week increased by over 160 \npercent and the number involved in over 20 hours of community recreation per week increased \nby over 223 percent.   \nInitiatives to Decrease Reliance on Sheltered Workshops - On January 16, 2014, CMS \npublished regulations strengthening the definition of home and community-based services that \nwould qualify for federal waiver funding; the new regulations became effective on March 17, \n2014.  On February 26, 2014, several weeks before the new CMS rule became final, the State \nalerted community providers that the State was raising expectations in alignment with the letter \nand spirit of the new rule, stating that it “will directly impact any workshop where individuals \nare not routinely participating in integrated activities,” and that sheltered workshops “will be \nrequired to be phased out” (emphasis added).  The State instructed the providers to plan now for \ntransition to more integrated day services.   \nOn July 1, 2014, the State added “day habilitation” to its two adult waivers to provide \nmore flexibility to offer facility-free services to individuals in integrated settings.  The State \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 28 of 50 - Page ID # 1300\n28 \n \nimplemented other revisions that prompt day providers to move away from sheltered workshop \nservices and towards more meaningful day activities in integrated settings.     \nWith regard to integrated day, the monitor concluded:  “[S]ince the inception of the \nSettlement Agreement, the State had worked to expand the community options available to \nindividuals, including both residential and day/vocational opportunities.  This had occurred \nthrough the expansion of the options available through Waiver-funded services …  the expansion \nof the community provider-base in the State, as well as work with providers interested in \nchanging their service delivery models (e.g., from a work center or day treatment model to \nprograms offering vocational as well as other integrated options for activities).”  IE Rep. at 6, 71.  \nShe concluded the State’s efforts to expand community options for integrated employment and \nvocational opportunities “clearly had paid off in terms of improved services and opportunities.”  \nId. at 88.  She reported that she saw “a number of examples of innovative vocational and day \nopportunities for individuals … progress has certainly been made.”  Id. at 9.  She found that \n“outcomes for individuals across the system appeared to be improving.”  Id. at 8, 86.   \nBSDC - In its findings letter, the United States noted that Nebraska failed to provide \nresidents with adequate, meaningful, integrated community activities.  The United States found \nthat:  no resident received programming off campus, only one resident worked significant hours \nin the community, the State focused on day services at sheltered workshops on the segregated \ncampus, the number of residents who participated in community outings was very limited as \nwere the number of days and hours per day, and residents were typically able to go to the \ncommunity only a handful of times per month, for just a couple of hours each time. \nSince entry of the Agreement, the State has taken significant steps to better integrate \nBSDC residents into the community during the day.  In 2014 and the first half of 2015, the State \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 29 of 50 - Page ID # 1301\n29 \n \nreported that over 90 percent of BSDC residents participated in off-campus activities at least \nonce per week; this is up from 73 percent in early 2013.  Integrated activities include paid work, \nvolunteer work, social and recreational activities, or general activities like shopping.   \nThe number and percentage of BSDC residents working in the community continues to \nincrease from year to year.  The percentage of eligible residents who work off campus has \nincreased significantly from less than one percent (one person) at the time of the United States’ \nfindings letter, to seven percent in 2010, to about 24 percent in 2011, to about 35 percent in \n2012, and to around 60 percent starting in 2013 through to today.  See Appendix B-5.  In the first \nquarter of 2015, the State reported that 53 BSDC residents were employed in the community, 62 \nresidents were employed on campus, and a total of 88 residents were employed (some work both \non and off campus); the State reported that only one eligible resident was not working at all.7   \nBSDC residents work in a variety of community settings – some do custodial work at the \nBeatrice Police Department, the local chamber of commerce, and AseraCare (an organization \nthat provides palliative care), while others package items at Exmark (a manufacturer of \nprofessional turf care equipment).  Other residents are involved in various forms of off-campus \nself-employment, such as lawn mowing, and delivering newspapers on a paper route.   \nThe State is continuing to take important steps at BSDC to further improve outcomes in \nthis area, including assigning an additional manager to the vocational team to increase the focus \non integrated employment and career development, implementing new practices to include more \nthorough consideration of eligibility for employment, developing a better database to track \ninterests and skills that will facilitate job development and placement, increasing collaboration \nwith the local chamber of commerce, a private staffing company, and community employers, and \n                                                           \n7 The State determined that 89 of 120 total residents were eligible for employment (not retired). \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 30 of 50 - Page ID # 1302\n30 \n \nproviding enhanced job coaching.  The State provides onsite job coaches, as well as ongoing \ntraining and other supports, for BSDC residents with jobs in integrated settings to ensure they \nsucceed in their community jobs and advance in their careers.  To encourage contact with the \ncommunity, the State also revised position descriptions for BSDC vocational support workers to \ngive them flexibility to follow people into community vocational services.     \nA significant number of BSDC residents now engage in volunteer activities in the \ncommunity.  Each month, more than 20 residents help deliver food to the needy through the \nMeals on Wheels program.  Residents are active with other community groups including the \nHumane Society, the Red Hat Society, Grow Big Red (Beatrice beautification project), Nature \nAbounds, the Salvation Army, recycling entities, as well as various churches and local clubs.      \nAt the time of the United States’ investigation, a significant number of individuals never \nleft their rooms or living units.  The State has now taken meaningful steps to get all residents off \ntheir residences to other locations, including the community.  In the second quarter of 2014, the \nState reported that just about everyone at BSDC engaged in five or more hours per day of skills \ntraining away from their home residence.  The State reported that only one resident did not meet \nthis criteria because he was on hospice and could not tolerate the hours away from his residence.   \nThe monitor concluded that State efforts to increase vocational opportunities at BSDC to \nbetter meet individualized needs in integrated settings have “yielded positive results.”  IE Rep. at \n156.  She reported the State had effected a “conceptual shift” regarding the role of the on-campus \nhome rooms, “de-emphasizing them as primary habilitation sites in favor of community-based \nvocational and other opportunities.”  Id. at 159.  She found that neither transportation nor staffing \nissues were a barrier to community integration activities.  Id. at 158.     \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 31 of 50 - Page ID # 1303\n31 \n \n11. Internal DD Agency Actions to Enhance Community Services \nThe State has taken a number of other important internal steps to expand and enhance \ncommunity capacity so as to better meet the needs of people with DD in the community and to \nminimize the risk of institutionalization.  \nService Coordination – After entry of the Agreement, the State transformed its old “case \nmanagement” system into a DD “service coordination” system where personnel now actively \nadvocate for each individual.  The State maintains small caseloads for service coordinators of no \nmore than 25 individuals per service coordinator.  The monitor reported that service coordinators \n“clearly knew the individuals and their provider staff” and were therefore better able to address \ntheir individualized needs.  Id. at 137.     \nServing Individuals with Complex Needs – In addition to the State’s mobile teams, in \n2010, the State created an internal technical assistance team to provide expert input and guidance \nto community providers.  The team provides technical assistance by phone, email, in person, and \nin formal meetings and training opportunities.  Since its creation, the team has handled hundreds \nof requests for information or assistance from community providers.   \nIII. INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IMPLEMENTED AT BSDC   \nA.  Safety and Protection from Harm \n \n1.  Settlement Agreement Requirements \n \nThe principal requirement of this section of the Agreement is that the State will “provide \nresidents with a reasonably safe and humane living environment, which includes that the State \nshall:  (1) protect residents from abuse and neglect; and (2) take effective steps to minimize or \neliminate resident injuries and other significant incidents that may negatively impact their health, \nsafety, and welfare.”  Agreement ¶ III.A.1.  Specific provisions require the State to:    \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 32 of 50 - Page ID # 1304\n32 \n \n•  ensure that individuals are free from abuse and neglect in a “zero-tolerance” \nenvironment;    \n \n•  minimize incidents that may adversely impact the health, safety, and welfare of \nindividuals, especially those incidents that result in serious injury; and \n \n•  implement prompt and effective measures to address all issues and recommendations \nassociated with investigations to ensure that individual outcomes are achieved.   \n \nId. ¶¶ III.A.2, 10, 14, 16, 18. \n2.  Overall Incident Numbers at BSDC \n \nIn its 2007 findings letter, the United States reported that BSDC was an unsafe \nenvironment, where serious incidents and injuries were common.   \nIncidents/Serious Incidents – Since then, the State has implemented effective reforms to \nheighten safety.  There has been a downward trend of serious incidents over time.  In 2013, there \nwere 26 serious incidents reported with only four injuries of unknown origin and just one \nelopement; the 2013 serious incident numbers represent a 50 percent reduction from as recent as \n2011.  Progress has been sustained:  in the first two quarters of 2015, there were only13 serious \nincidents, two injuries of unknown origin, and just one elopement – all figures at the same or \nimproved annual rates as in 2013.  See Appendix B-6.   \nOverall, the monitor found that the State has implemented effective measures to identify, \ndiscuss, and address systemic safety issues; she also noted that the State has implemented action \nplans to address outstanding issues.  IE Rep. at 17-19, 41-42, 45.  She reported that the State had \nimplemented effective measures to identify root causes and whether or not incidents were \npreventable.  Id. She attributed success here, in part, to better staff training and improved \nbehavior plans and implementation.  Id.  \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 33 of 50 - Page ID # 1305\n33 \n \nPeer-to-Peer Aggression - In its findings letter, the United States found that peer-to-peer \naggression was rampant at BSDC; in the year before its onsite visit, the United States found that \nthere were over 100 different residents who were characterized as aggressors in well over 500 \nseparate incidents, many of which caused an injury to a resident. \nSince that time, the State has undertaken significant efforts to reduce incidents of \naggression between peers.  In 2013, there were only 42 incidents of peer-to-peer aggression; this \nrepresents a 91 percent reduction from the time of the findings letter.  No incident of peer \naggression in 2013 resulted in significant physical harm.  The number of peer-to-peer incidents \nand injuries has continued to stay low.  In 2014, there were only 21 peer-to-peer incidents and no \nincident resulted in significant physical harm.  In the first half of 2015, there have been 23 such \nincidents, but only one minor injury and again no significant injuries.  See Appendix B-6. \nThe monitor reported that the State has made and sustained progress in addressing \noutstanding issues associated with peer-to-peer incidents.  IE Rep. at 17, 46.  She found that \nthere were decreasing trends with regard to the number of incidents, numbers of victims, and \nnumber of aggressors.  She wrote that she “commends Facility staff for their commitment to and \nactive pursuit of reducing risk in relation to peer-to-peer incidents of aggression.  These efforts \nclearly have resulted in improved quality of life for individuals the Facility serves.”  Id.       \n3.  Abuse and Neglect at BSDC \nIn its 2007 findings letter, the United States concluded that the nature and frequency of \nabuse and neglect at BSDC suggested a “cultural undercurrent that betrays human decency at the \nmost fundamental levels … basic human dignities are violated with considerable regularity.”  In \nthe year before the United States completed its onsite review, there were over 200 incidents at \nBSDC that involved an allegation of abuse or neglect, with over half of these later substantiated.  \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 34 of 50 - Page ID # 1306\n34 \n \nThe United States’ findings letter contained numerous individual examples of substantiated \nphysical abuse and neglect of residents, often resulting in a serious injury to the individual.   \nPer the Agreement, the State now maintains a “zero tolerance” policy for abuse and \nneglect.  The State developed broad definitions of abuse and neglect that include verbal abuse \nand exploitation.  The monitor found these definitional revisions were “important changes” that \nsupported the State’s commitment to zero tolerance for abuse and neglect.  IE Rep. at 27.       \nState policies at BSDC require staff to promptly attend to any residents involved in an \nabuse/neglect incident and ensure they are safe.  Per the Agreement, the monitor concluded that \nthe State was now removing alleged perpetrators from direct resident contact whenever there was \nan allegation of abuse or neglect.  She also concluded that the State was imposing appropriate \ndiscipline, including termination, whenever allegations were substantiated.        \nThe State’s zero tolerance policy stresses that any substantiated act of abuse, neglect, or \nmistreatment may result in termination of the employee, as would failure to report witnessed acts \nof abuse or neglect.  Since at least 2012, the State has fired every single employee who was \nfound to have committed substantiated abuse or serious neglect.  The State even fires employees \nwho fail to report suspected abuse or neglect in a timely manner.8   \nSubstantiated abuse incidents at BSDC have continued a steady path of decline:  at the \ntime of the United States’ findings letter, there were over 100 reported instances; in 2011, there \nwere 11 reported instances; in 2012, there were five such instances; in 2013, there were three \n                                                           \n8 On November 10, 2014, in Essman v. Nebraska Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., Civ. No. A-\n13-840, the Nebraska Court of Appeals affirmed a decision of the district court of Lancaster \nCounty that upheld the termination of a BSDC employee who failed to promptly report an abuse \nallegation.  The court referenced the State’s “zero tolerance” policy, imposed per the Agreement.  \nThis action and decision have had a positive and chilling effect on any would-be abusers; it sent \na strong message to all that abuse and neglect will not be tolerated. \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 35 of 50 - Page ID # 1307\n35 \n \nsuch instances; in 2014, there were only two instances, and there was no reported substantiated \nabuse in the first two quarters of 2015.  The same downward trend is present with regard to \nneglect at BSDC.  In 2014, the State reported a total of eight instances of substantiated neglect, \nwith only one instance in the first half of 2015.  See Appendix B-7.  Combined abuse/neglect \nfigures thus far in 2015 project to an annual total of only two substantiated instances of abuse \nand neglect at BSDC.    \nIn 2011, it emerged that there had been very troubling staff abuse of some residents at \nBSDC that was hidden from State leadership.  After a close examination, the United States \ndetermined that these incidents were isolated and not reflective of conditions and practices \nthroughout BSDC.  Given the serious nature of the abuse, we discuss the circumstances in more \ndetail in Appendix C, attached to the accompanying index of evidentiary materials. \n4.  Improved Internal Processes to Minimize Risk of Harm at BSDC \n  In its findings letter, the United States found problems related to the facility’s incident \nmanagement system that contributed to further risk of harm.  The United States also found a \nnumber of problems with the investigation of serious incidents at the facility, as well as with the \nimplementation of needed corrective measures associated with investigation recommendations.  \nIncidents and Investigations - Today at BSDC, there is an adequate incident management \npolicy in place with appropriate reporting requirements and follow-up procedures.  The State \nmaintains a database on incident data, analyzes the data, and determines whether or not incidents \nwere preventable.  The State has instituted daily incident meetings to review incidents that \noccurred the previous business day, make recommendations on how to address any outstanding \nissues, and track implementation of the recommendations.  As a result, the monitor concluded:  \n“Since the beginning of the implementation of the Settlement Agreement, improvement had \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 36 of 50 - Page ID # 1308\n36 \n \noccurred with regard to the analysis of incidents and allegations.”  IE Rep. at 17, 41-42.  She also \npraised the State for working to “ensure that if analyses showed problems or trends related to \nincidents and allegations, action plans were developed to address them.”  Id. at 17, 42.   \nThe monitor concluded that the State has also complied with requirements related to \ninvestigations, including their timely initiation and completion, thoroughness, reconciliation of \nevidence, and providing an adequate basis for findings.  Id. at 17, 48.  Investigations now \ncommence at least by the next working day of the incident being reported and they are completed \nwithin 30 days.  Id. at 47.  The monitor concluded that the investigations at BSDC were \nthorough, provided an adequate basis for findings, and showed “improvement over time.”  Id. at \n48.  She found there was ongoing improvement with regard to the quality, thoroughness, and the \nmeasurability of action plans.  Id. at 17, 35, 41. \nFor several years now, the State has been forwarding to the local county attorney and \nappropriate law enforcement officials pertinent information associated with certain investigations \nthat might lead to a criminal case.  The monitor applauded this and concluded that there was \nclear collaboration with law enforcement.  Id. at 49.   \nQuality Assurance - There is now an adequate quality assurance system in place at BSDC \non multiple levels and this has had a positive impact on incidents and overall risk of harm.  The \nState’s quality improvement structure identifies problematic trends, analyzes their causes, \nimplements measures to address suspected causes, and evaluates their effectiveness.  The State \nhas developed indicators addressing important aspects of service quality and of critical \noutcomes, including health, well-being, and independence.  The monitor concluded that quality \nimprovement activities are ongoing and deepening and that they produce action plans that are \nimplemented, and typically produce “improvements” for individuals.  Id. at 18-19, 45-46.      \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 37 of 50 - Page ID # 1309\n37 \n \nB.  Behavioral Services, Restraints, and Psychiatric Care \n1.  Settlement Agreement Requirements \n  The principal requirement is that the State will provide adequate behavioral services to \nmeet the needs of each person to provide a reasonable opportunity to “enhance functioning, to \ngrow and develop, to attain self-help and social skills needed to exercise as much autonomy or \nindependence as possible, to prevent or decelerate both physical and psychological regression, \nloss of skills and functional status, and to ensure their reasonable safety, security and freedom \nfrom undue bodily restraint.”  Agreement ¶ III.C.54.    \n  The Agreement requires that “all residents [be] free from unreasonable restraint,” to \nremove restraint as an acceptable form of planned behavioral intervention, and to develop steps \nsuch that the use of restraints will become “a very rare occurrence.”  Id. ¶¶ III.C.72-73, 77.  \n2.  Improved Behavioral Services \nIn its findings letter, the United States concluded that the State failed to provide adequate \nbehavioral services for dozens of BSDC residents with behavior problems.  The United States \nreported that this deficiency contributed to poor outcomes, including injury, abuse, the use of \nhighly restrictive interventions, and decreased opportunities for placement in community \nsettings.  BSDC behavior plans typically included some form of restraint element, such as multi-\npoint restraints where people were tied to beds with cloth and leather straps with buckles.  \nFunctional assessments and behavior plans at BSDC now include all required \ncomponents, including procedures to decrease problem behaviors, developing and strengthening \nreplacement behaviors, active skill acquisition techniques, individualized reinforcers, \nenvironmental elements, and data collection systems.  The State now implements the behavior \nplans in a timely manner.  The monitor concluded that “the practice of functional behavior \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 38 of 50 - Page ID # 1310\n38 \n \nassessment at BSDC appeared to be generally in line with expectations described in the \nSettlement Agreement.”  IE Rep. at 152.  She found that BSDC behavior plans generally meet \nthe requirements of the Agreement and that revised plans showed “significant improvement” in \nareas previously found problematic.  Id. at 160-63.  The monitor found the State has “made good \nprogress” implementing quality behavior plans.  Id. at 161, 163.     \n3.  Drastic Reduction in the Use of Restraints \nIn its 2007 findings letter, the United States concluded that the State subjected BSDC \nresidents to undue restraint.  The United States characterized injuries and incidents associated \nwith restraint usage at BSDC as “alarming and disconcerting.”  The United States reported that \nBSDC routinely utilized physical restraints, as well as invasive multi-point mechanical restraints, \noften tying down a person’s two arms, two legs, and upper torso with straps, and the facility used \nphysical and mechanical restraints on both an emergency basis and as a planned intervention.    \nMechanical Restraints – At the time of its investigation, the United States’ psychology \nconsultant concluded that mechanical restraint usage at BSDC was “the highest in frequency and \nduration that I have seen in my experience.”  The United States found that dozens of residents \nwere subjected to tens of thousands of minutes of planned mechanical restraint.   \nOne of the most significant accomplishments of the Agreement is the complete \neradication of mechanical restraint usage in the Nebraska DD system – at BSDC, at Bridges, and \nin the community.  This is a direct result of reforms implemented per the Agreement.  In January \n2011, the last mechanical restraint was used at Bridges; in December 2011, the last mechanical \nrestraint was used at BSDC; and mechanical restraints have not been used at all in the \ncommunity since the entry of the Agreement.   \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 39 of 50 - Page ID # 1311\n39 \n \nPhysical Restraints - In 2008, about 21 percent of BSDC residents – about six dozen \nindividuals – were subjected to physical restraints.  There were 539 instances of physical \nrestraint that totaled 2,660 minutes.  In the first half of 2015, there were only 19 instances of \nphysical restraint for a total of 106 minutes; this represents more than a 90 percent reduction in \nthe annual use of physical restraints at BSDC from the first year of the Agreement.  See \nAppendix B-8.  In the second quarter of 2015, only three individuals (about two percent of the \nBSDC census) were subjected to physical restraint, a total of 10 times, for a total of 59 minutes.     \nThe reduction is due directly to changes implemented per the Agreement – programmatic \nphysical restraints are no longer permitted, physical restraints may only be utilized as emergency \nsafety interventions, and the State constantly works towards zero use of physical restraint.  State \npolicies on restraints are now consistent with requirements of the Agreement.   \nOverall, the monitor reported that data showed “significant declines in the use of \nrestraint.”  IE Rep. at 20.  She found that use of restraints has become a “rare occurrence.”  Id. at \n174.  She concluded that the State is to be “commended for marked positive changes in attitudes \nand practices with respect to responding to behavioral crisis situations.”  Id. at 20.  She reported \nthat injuries related to restraints are “low,” and that in 2013, there were only two minor injuries \nrelated to a physical hold.  Id. at 170.     \nThe State was able to significantly reduce physical restraints and completely eliminate \nmechanical restraints at BSDC without increasing the use of psychotropic medications; indeed, \nthe percentage of residents prescribed psychotropic medications has decreased in recent years.     \n4.  Improved Mental Health Services \nIn its findings letter, the United States concluded that the State failed to provide adequate \npsychiatric services to individuals with co-occurring mental illness.  The United States found that \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 40 of 50 - Page ID # 1312\n40 \n \npsychotropic medication usage at BSDC was very high, that the incidence of psychotropic \npolypharmacy was high, and that some individuals were “grossly overmedicated.”        \nThe State is now providing BSDC residents with adequate routine and emergency \npsychiatric services.  There are sufficient psychiatry hours now to meet the mental health needs \nof those at BSDC, including enough time to complete thorough evaluations, develop carefully \nconsidered differential diagnoses, order appropriate treatments, and provide needed follow up.  \nThe monitor found that if needed, residents could be seen “quite frequently.”  Id. at 178.       \nThe monitor concluded that psychiatric care at BSDC was an area in which “significant \nimprovement had been achieved over time.”  Id. at 21.  Positive areas include development and \nimplementation of proper psychiatric treatment plans, incorporation of behavioral data into the \ndecision-making process, and better coordination between psychiatrists and other professionals.  \nThe State conducted a review to bring all psychiatric diagnoses in line with current DSM criteria; \nthere is now adequate justification for psychiatric diagnoses at BSDC.  The monitor found that \npsychiatrists were “paying close attention to the diagnostic criteria when making diagnoses, \nwhich potentially was also having a positive impact on treatment.”  Id. at 21-22, 180.   \nThe monitor reported that there were “ongoing attempts to manage individuals on the \nlowest necessary dose of [psychotropic] medications, and to minimize the number of \nmedications the individuals were prescribed.”  Id. at 181.  Psychiatrists regularly review the \ncurrent medication regimen of each individual to determine whether or not the types and dosages \nof medication are appropriate and necessary, and then make changes when needed.   \nAt the outset of this case, there were over 150 BSDC residents taking at least one \npsychotropic medication; today, that number has been cut by more than half.  This decrease is \ndue in part to the reduction of the overall census, but it is also the product of a concerted effort to \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 41 of 50 - Page ID # 1313\n41 \n \nminimize the use of these medications.  Reduced reliance on psychotropic medications decreases \nthe risk of adverse consequences associated with medication side effects.   \nThe number of residents who are subjected to psychotropic polypharmacy has been \ndecreasing.  For the past year, there have been only six residents who were taking two or more \npsychotropics; this yields a polypharmacy rate of under 15 percent among those taking \npsychotropic medication, and a rate of around five percent of the total BSDC census.       \nIn 2014, there were only eight instances of emergency use of psychotropic medication at \nBSDC, even though there were over 90 behavioral crisis episodes.  During the first two quarters \nof 2015, there were 36 behavioral crisis episodes, with only a handful involving emergency use \nof medication.  This is a testament to the State using less onerous practices to deal with crises.  \nThe monitor reported that it was “impressive” that psychiatrists have refrained from increasing \nreliance on medications when behaviors escalated.  Id. at 180.       \nThe monitor reported that the State does a “good job” monitoring side effects and related \nhealth markers.  Id. at 181.  She also concluded that the State has adequately addressed concerns \nraised in earlier monitoring reports with regard to providing guardians with sufficient \ninformation to make fully informed decisions with regard to mental health care.  Id. at 21.                    \nC.  Health Care and Related Services \n1.  Settlement Agreement Requirements \nThis section of the Agreement requires the State to provide individuals with adequate, \nappropriate, and timely preventive, routine, acute, and emergency health care to meet the \nindividualized needs of each person.  Agreement ¶ III.D.90.  The Agreement includes provisions \non medical care, neurological care, nursing services, nutritional and physical supports, and \nvarious therapeutic interventions.  Id. ¶¶ III.D.92-140.  The Agreement establishes a priority \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 42 of 50 - Page ID # 1314\n42 \n \ngroup for “heightened and enhanced attention and focus”; this includes those with a seizure \ndisorder and those at risk of suffering a bowel obstruction, an aspiration event, a decubitus ulcer, \na fracture, or an event associated with other at-risk conditions.  Id. ¶ III.D.97.   \n2.  Improved Health Care  \nIn its findings letter, the United States found that the State failed to provide BSDC \nresidents with adequate health care.  The United States found that health care was more reactive \nthan proactive, especially with regard to individuals with complex, high-risk conditions.   \nImproved Clinical Practices – Since entry of the Agreement, the State has implemented a \nhost of improved health care practices to better meet the needs of BSDC residents, including \nthose with more involved health conditions:   \n•  The State is now providing BSDC residents with timely health care evaluations.  The \nState has implemented an electronic system to ensure that referrals and testing procedures \nare completed and results are available in a timely manner.   \n \n•  The State makes prompt referrals to specialists when needed.  The State has also \naddressed issues associated with providing critical health care information to them.   \n \n•  The State has begun to implement an electronic health record that facilitates the delivery \nof care and services, improves clinical work flow and communication, enhances \nimplementation of quality assurance measures, and helps achieve positive outcomes.   \n \n•  The State properly utilizes a health care screening tool to better ensure provision of \nroutine and preventive health care based on individual needs.  The State is appropriately \nidentifying a priority group of individuals with high health risks.  Individuals in this \ngroup receive individualized and appropriate health care that produces desired outcomes.   \n \nQuality Assurance - The State has expanded its quality assurance system at BSDC to \nbetter ensure that it is taking an individualized and comprehensive approach to meet each \nperson’s needs and it has integrated health quality assurance processes with the larger quality \nassurance system.  The monitor concluded that “[a]ttention to closing the loop between medical \naudits and necessary corrective actions was apparent.”  IE Rep. at 194.    \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 43 of 50 - Page ID # 1315\n43 \n \nNursing - Nursing services at BSDC have improved since the entry of the Agreement.  In \ngeneral, properly trained staff now provide appropriate nursing services to meet individualized \nneeds.  Nurses utilize appropriate nursing assessment tools, flow sheets, and tracking records and \nmake timely changes to care plans whenever issues arise.  The monitor has endorsed the \nfollowing nursing reforms and improved practices: \n•  The State has implemented a comprehensive, workable system to ensure that nurses are \ndocumenting accurately; the monitor concluded that these efforts have a “positive \nimpact” on delivery of quality care.   \n \n•  The monitor concluded that there was “significant improvement” in nursing plans and \nthat they were “individualized and provided an understanding of needed daily care \nelements.”  The primary nurse or supervisor makes changes to individual nursing plans as \nneeded and then the health care coordinators communicate the changes to other team \nmembers; the monitor concluded that this system was “functioning well.”  \n \nId. at 205, 206. \n \nOutcomes - Since entry of the Agreement, the health care reforms implemented at BSDC \nhave produced positive outcomes.  Here are some examples:   \n•  In 2009, BSDC residents made 260 visits to a hospital emergency room or were admitted \nto a hospital for serious health care issues.  Since then, the number of hospital contacts \nhas decreased steadily to only 76 contacts in all of 2013; this is a reduced rate even \naccounting for the census drop.  In the first two quarters of 2015, there has been a further \nreduction with only 33 individuals having such hospital contacts.   \n \n•  There is an overall downward trend in the incidence of pressure ulcers at BSDC.  In \n2014, the average number of residents with new pressure ulcers per the overall census \nwas only 0.8 percent; there was only one pressure ulcer recorded per quarter.  In the first \ntwo quarters of 2015, no BSDC resident had a pressure ulcer.   \n \n•  The medication error rate at BSDC is very low, and since 2013, no medication error has \nproduced a harmful outcome for involved individuals.   \n \nSeizure Disorders - The State now provides BSDC residents with seizure disorders with \nappropriate neurological care.  Clinicians provide a proper documented rationale for treatment \nand engage in active efforts to reduce anticonvulsant polypharmacy.  There is now sensitivity to \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 44 of 50 - Page ID # 1316\n44 \n \nthe need to manage medication to minimize adverse side effects.  The State compiles and uses \nappropriate seizure data throughout treatment.  The monitor reported that the State has developed \n“seizure needs” plans and has trained staff on how to implement them; these plans include \ninformation on how to properly address status epilepticus.  Id. at 199.  All disciplines \ncommunicate well to provide coordinated care, the State provides specialty consultations when \nneeded, and uses seizure data as a part of service delivery.    \n3.  Improved Physical and Nutritional Supports, Therapies, and Communication Services \nIn its findings letter, the United States found that residents did not receive adequate PNS \nat BSDC.  The United States found that the facility did not provide adequate occupational \ntherapy, physical therapy, or speech therapy, and that assistive technology resources were \ninadequate to meet the needs of the individuals.   \nPhysical and Nutritional Supports - Since entry of the Agreement, the monitor reported \nthat the State had made “significant progress” in providing PNS to meet individualized needs at \nBSDC.  Id. at 22.  The monitor concluded that the State “continued to develop, revise, and \nimplement a sustainable system for the provision of physical and nutritional supports for \nindividuals with identified needs.”  Id. at 221.  The monitor concluded that the State had made \n“significant improvements” in this area.  Id. at 217-20.   \nIn April 2010, the State created a PNS team to provide proactive care and services to \npeople with dysphagia and those who aspirate or are at risk of aspiration to minimize risks \nassociated with choking, aspiration, pneumonia, skin breakdown, and nutritional decline.   \nThe State works to ensure implementation of proper mealtime and positioning strategies \nthroughout the day for at-risk individuals, as well as enhanced nursing oversight and monitoring \nof signs and symptoms.  The State has taken a number of important steps: \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 45 of 50 - Page ID # 1317\n45 \n \n•  The State has developed reasonable methodologies for identifying individuals in need of \nsupports, through multiple pathways including screening tools and change of status data.   \n \n•  The State now conducts regular “status change” meetings to alert team members of \nresidents who might be in the early stages of experiencing a change in status.  The \nmonitor applauded this new practice, as it produced more proactive service-delivery.   \n \n•  The monitor reported that the State now performs individualized positioning evaluations \nto reduce the risk of aspiration and concluded this was very positive.    \n \nId. at 23.  \n \nThe monitor concluded that team interventions over the years have “significantly \nimproved outcomes for individuals.”  Id. at 22.  She found that the State had “successfully \ntransitioned to intervening more proactively with individuals and providing timely PNS services \nand supports.”  Id. at 23, 232.  As a result, choking incidents are down in recent years and the \nincidence of pneumonias, including aspiration pneumonias, has decreased.     \nTherapies - The State now complies with Agreement requirements with regard to \nphysical and occupational therapy assessments.  The monitor concluded that the State has \n“adequate templates, including guiding questions, and policies [and that] OT/PT assessments \nwere comprehensive and addressed the assessment components as outlined” in the Agreement.  \nId. at 227.  She reported that the State had “developed and implemented a number of processes \naimed at improving outcomes for individuals.”  Id. at 233.  She concluded the State “continued \nto be committed to expanding the number of individuals who received therapeutic positioning in \nmultiple environments … to minimize and/or reduce their risk factors.”  Id. at 235.      \nThe State created a specialty multi-disciplinary neuromuscular spine and gait services \nclinic to address the needs of those with physical disabilities.  The State also improved practices \nassociated with fabrication, modification, and repair of wheelchairs and other adaptive \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 46 of 50 - Page ID # 1318\n46 \n \nequipment.  The monitor concluded that the improved processes were sustainable and \n“significantly improved outcomes for individuals” at BSDC.  Id. at 22.   \nCommunication - The State is now providing direct speech and language therapy to an \nincreased number of individuals.  The monitor noted the State was now integrating \nindividualized communication assessments and strategies into annual plans and implementing \nmeasures to provide enhanced communication services/supports in multiple environments.  Id. at \n24-25.  The monitor concluded that the State had implemented “major positive revisions to the [] \nassessment format, especially in the area of [communication] assessment … Competency-based \ntraining also had been provided to ensure staff knew how to use and assist individuals with the \ndevices.”  Id. at 24-25, 240-41.        \n4.  Mortalities \nIn its findings letter, the United States found that some individuals with DD in the State’s \nsystem appeared to have suffered preventable deaths.  The United States noted that there was no \nin-depth root cause analysis of each death to determine if the course of care in the weeks prior to \nthe death was inadequate. \nIndependent Mortality Investigations – The Agreement requires the State to create an \nindependent and external mortality review committee to conduct in-depth death reviews and to \nissue written reports to identify preventable causes so that similarly situated individuals would \nnot suffer preventable illness or death.  Agreement ¶ III.D.106.  The State is to then ensure \nprompt and effective implementation of the committee’s recommendations.  Id. ¶ III.D.108.  \nThe State contracted with the Columbus Organization to conduct the independent \nmortality investigations for individuals in the institutional sub-group.  Typically, a doctor and a \nnurse with DD experience conduct the reviews.  This process has been positive and rigorous; \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 47 of 50 - Page ID # 1319\n47 \n \nColumbus has produced in-depth, independent reviews to expose weaknesses in the State’s \nservice-delivery system.  The reports are well-written and contain findings, more exact and \naccurate causes of death, concerns associated with the death (if any), and individual and systemic \nrecommendations to help avoid preventable illness and death going forward.  The State provides \na copy of the Columbus reports to the community providers to prompt needed remedies.  The \nState also provides a copy to the regional DD office and the Division of Public Health, for \nsystemic follow up.   \nCommunity – In May of this year, the State issued its second annual report on deaths for \nthe thousands of people with DD in the State’s system.  The State reported that 65 individuals \ndied in integrated community settings in Nebraska in 2014.  Almost one-third of the people who \ndied in 2014 were on hospice care.  Mortality rates for the past two years in Nebraska are \nfavorable, and reflect positively on the State’s DD system as a whole.  The State commits to \nmaking the annual mortality report a public document this year and going forward.   \nBSDC – In 2009, the first full year under the Agreement, 25 individuals from the \ninstitutional sub-group died; this was largely due to the trauma associated with an unexpected \nemergency evacuation order from the State Department of Public Health in February 2009, that \nmandated the removal of about four dozen medically fragile individuals from BSDC because \nBSDC was not able to deliver effective health care services to individuals with complex health \nneeds.  Within a year of that emergency order, a dozen displaced individuals had died.  We \ndiscuss this evacuation order and the individuals impacted by it in greater depth in Appendix D, \nattached to the accompanying index of evidentiary materials.  \nCommunity capacity started to expand and meaningful reforms took root for the first time \nin 2010.  From January 1, 2010 through April 2015, a total of 59 individuals with DD from the \n\n8:08-cv-00271-RGK-DLP   Doc # 115   Filed: 07/22/15   Page 48 of 50 - Page ID # 1320\n48 \n \nsub-group have died, averaging less than a dozen deaths per year; almost two-thirds of those died \nwhile residing in an institutional setting, such as BSDC or a nursing home.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the parties jointly ask the Court to find that the \ninformation contained in this memorandum in support is sufficient to enable the Court to dismiss \nthis case with prejudice given the State’s sustained compliance with the terms of the remedial \nSettlement Agreement in this case.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n            FOR THE UNITED STATES, \nPLAINTIFF: \n \n            VANITA GUPTA \n            Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n \n            EVE L.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nAssistant Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW - RFK \nWashington, DC  20530 \nMarch 7, 2008 \nThe Honorable Dave Heineman \nGovernor of Nebraska \nOffice of the Governor \nP.O. Box 94848 \nLincoln, NE 68509-4848 \nRe:\t CRIPA Investigation of the Beatrice State Developmental Center, \n\nBeatrice, Nebraska \n\nDear Governor Heineman: \nI am writing to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation of \nconditions and practices at the Beatrice State Developmental Center (“BSDC”), in Beatrice, \nNebraska. On May 29, 2007, we notified you that we were initiating an investigation of BSDC \npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997. \nCRIPA gives the Department of Justice authority to seek a remedy for a pattern and practice of \nconduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of persons with developmental \ndisabilities who are served in public institutions. \nOn September 6, 2007, we conducted an initial walk-through of BSDC.  From October \n15-19, 2007, we conducted a more in-depth, on-site review of BSDC with expert consultants in \nthe areas of protection from harm, training and behavioral services, psychiatry, health care, and \nnutritional and physical management.1 In conducting our on-site investigation, we interviewed \nadministrators, professionals, staff, and residents.  We observed residents in a variety of settings, \nincluding on their living units, at activity areas, and during meals.  Before, during, and after our \nvisit, we reviewed a wide range of documents, including policies, procedures, medical records, \nand other documents related to the care and treatment of dozens of BSDC residents.  At the end \nof the tour, consistent with our pledge of transparency and to provide technical assistance where \nappropriate regarding our investigatory findings, we provided an exit presentation to convey our \npreliminary findings in each area to State counsel and to facility and State officials. \n1 On October 14, 2007, we conducted a brief on-site inspection of the Bridges facility, a \nBSDC-affiliated program for about a dozen persons with developmental disabilities, located in \nHastings, Nebraska. \n\n- 2 -\nWe would like to express our appreciation to the BSDC administrators, professionals, \nand staff and to the State officials, especially Christine Peterson, Chief Executive Officer of the \nNebraska Department of Health and Human Services, and John Wyvill, Director of the \nDepartment’s Division of Developmental Disabilities, for their assistance, cooperation, \nprofessionalism, and courtesy throughout our investigation.  We hope to continue to work with \nthe State and BSDC officials in the same cooperative manner going forward. \nConsistent with our statutory obligations under CRIPA, I now write to advise you \nformally of the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting them, and the minimum \nremedial steps that are necessary to remedy the deficiencies set forth below.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997b(a). We have concluded that numerous conditions and practices at BSDC violate the \nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of its residents.  In particular, we find that BSDC fails \nto provide its residents with adequate: (A) protection from harm; (B) training and associated \nbehavioral and mental health services; (C) health care, including nutritional and physical \nmanagement; and (D) discharge planning and placement in the most integrated setting.  See \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982); Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396; 42 C.F.R. Part 483, Subpart I (Medicaid Program Provisions); Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). \nI.  BACKGROUND \nBSDC is a State-owned and -operated residential facility for persons with developmental \ndisabilities such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism.  At the time of our initial visit \nin September 2007, BSDC housed a total of 333 residents; the ages of the residents ranged from \n14 to 85. There were 15 residents aged 22-years-old or younger; there were 26 residents aged \n65-years-old or older. \nBSDC residents live in approximately 25 living units spread across the facility’s campus. \nAt the time of our visit, about six residents resided primarily in the BSDC acute care unit.  In \naddition, there is an eight-bed residential program on campus called the Intensive Treatment \nServices (“ITS”) unit that admits, on a short-term basis, persons with developmental disabilities \nwho are experiencing temporary difficulties in a home or other community placement.  The ITS \nstrives to provide specialized and dedicated treatment and supports for these individuals so that \nthey may return to the community as soon as possible.  At the time of our visit, eight persons \nresided in the ITS. \nThe Bridges facility is a BSDC-affiliated residential program, located on a separate \ncampus in Hastings, Nebraska.  This program treats persons with severe behavioral problems \nand/or a dual diagnosis of mental retardation and mental illness.  The Bridges is a more \nrestrictive residential facility because the individuals served there typically have been involved \nin serious incidents that led to the involvement of law enforcement.  Although it has a bed \ncapacity of 14, at the time of our visit, Bridges served 11 persons with developmental \ndisabilities. \n\n- 3 -\nThe intellectual abilities of the BSDC residents are varied. The diagnoses of BSDC \nresidents with mental retardation range from mild to profound.  The residents possess diverse \nabilities and functional levels. Some residents require more staffing supports to meet their daily \nneeds, while others are much more independent and capable of meeting their own needs.  Many \nof the residents have swallowing disorders, seizure disorders, ambulation issues, or other health \ncare needs. A significant portion of the BSDC population is medically complex and requires \nassistance at mealtimes and other frequent monitoring. \nThere are a number of residents at the facility who have developed maladaptive \nbehaviors, such as self-injurious behavior or aggression.  Indeed, almost half of the residents \nexhibit physical aggression of some sort.  At the time of our visit, the facility reported that over \n175 BSDC residents had a behavior program and that these programs typically included some \nform of restrictive component, such as 4-point and 5-point restraints used on residents in beds. \nIn the year prior to our visit, dozens of BSDC residents were subjected to highly restrictive \ninterventions, often on multiple occasions, sometimes for prolonged periods of time.  About half \nof the BSDC residents have been diagnosed as having mental illness, and all but a handful of \nthese residents were receiving one or more psychotropic medications.    \nII.  FINDINGS \nA.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \nThe Supreme Court has established that persons with developmental disabilities who \nreside in state institutions have a “constitutionally protected liberty interest in safety.” \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. at 318. The Court held that the state “has the unquestioned duty \nto provide reasonable safety for all residents” within the institution.  Id. at 324. However, the \nstate fails to protect BSDC residents from harm and risk of harm and to provide them with a \nreasonably safe living environment.2 \n2 Consistent with our findings here, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(“CMS”) within the United States Department of Health and Human Services has found a \nnumber of problems with regard to unsafe conditions and other deficient practices at BSDC in \nrecent years. CMS is a federal agency that is independent from the Department of Justice.  On \nSeptember 29, 2006, CMS conducted a full federal survey of the facility and found numerous \ndeficiencies, including three Immediate Jeopardy citations (the most serious), and seven out of \neight conditions of Medicaid participation outstanding.  A follow-up survey in April 2007 \nrevealed ongoing deficiencies, including an Immediate Jeopardy citation for inadequate \nprotection of residents, inadequate dental services, and failure to provide adequate food service \nequipment.  A second follow-up survey from October 30 to November 7, 2007, produced an \nImmediate Jeopardy citation related to substantiated physical abuse allegations, as well as a \nstring of other deficiencies. Ongoing deficiencies imperil the continued distribution of Medicaid \nfunding to the State to provide services for BSDC residents. \n\n- 4 \n-\nBSDC residents are subjected to abuse and neglect and suffer a high number of incidents \nthat often result in injuries or other poor outcomes.  We found consistent patterns of staff actions \nthat often subjected residents to repeated preventable injury. Resolution of problems is \nhampered by concerns associated with BSDC’s incident reporting and investigation system. \n1.  Abuse and Neglect of Residents \nOur safety consultant concluded that the nature of many abuse and neglect allegations, \nand the frequency with which they are made, suggests a “cultural undercurrent that betrays \nhuman decency at the most fundamental levels ... basic human dignities are violated with \nconsiderable regularity” at BSDC. \nFor the period between October 1, 2006 and October 16, 2007, the BSDC client abuse, \nneglect, and exploitation log reveals approximately 200 incidents at the facility that in some way \ninvolved an allegation of abuse and/or neglect of residents.  Facility investigators substantiated \nthe allegation of abuse or neglect, at least in part, in over half of these cases. Other BSDC \ndocuments reveal that in 2007 alone, through the end of September, there were approximately \n141 allegations of abuse and/or neglect of residents, with 52 of these allegations substantiated by \ninternal investigators. Last year, through the third quarter of 2007, the facility reported that 185 \nemployees had been suspended due to substantiated abuse or neglect of residents; many of these \nemployees later were either terminated or resigned.  \nWe highlight below a few recent examples where internal BSDC investigations \nsubstantiated abuse or neglect allegations, demonstrating, in part, the facility’s failure to protect \nits residents from harm. \na.  Abuse \n•  BSDC investigators substantiated mental abuse of resident WC3 after concluding that \nstaff engaged WC in a “game” of what could be called “canine catch” in August 2007. \nThis involved staff tossing WC’s pop bottle across the room, instructing the resident to \nretrieve or “fetch” the bottle, and then return it.  After repeating this “game” at least \ntwice, a staffer was observed hiding the bottle behind her back while motioning WC \nacross the room to find the bottle.  Not realizing that the staffer had the bottle, WC ran \naround the room aimlessly searching for it. \n•  BSDC investigators substantiated physical abuse where a direct care staff worker injured \nresident VB at the gym.  In June 2007, the staff worker pushed her foot down “with \nforce” on the forearm of the resident, who was touching an outlet.  As a result of the \n3 In order to protect the identity of residents, we use coded initials throughout this letter. \nWe will transmit separately a schedule cross-referencing the coded initials with the actual names \nof the residents. \n\n- 5 -\nincident, VB suffered severe lacerations on his index finger and down the center of his \nmiddle finger through the flexor tendon.  The resident had to be transferred to Lincoln for \nsurgery to repair the lacerations. At the time of the investigation, it was unclear whether \nhe would ever regain the full use of his middle finger. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated both mental and physical abuse of resident UA, who \nrequires enhanced staffing to meet his needs.  In June 2007, a direct care staff worker \nbegan to taunt and upset UA while playing a board game.  After the resident reached out \nin frustration, the staffer retaliated by shoving UA and knocking him to the floor, causing \na purple bruise to the resident’s right elbow. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated both physical and mental abuse where, in April 2007, a \nmale staff worker “slammed” resident TW into a wall for pretending to take a female \nstaff worker’s lunch item.  After the push, TW became sad, went to the bathroom, and \ncried. TW said the altercation “knocked the wind out” of him.  BSDC confirmed three \nprior allegations of physical abuse of this resident by the same staff worker in the prior \nnine months. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated both verbal and physical abuse by a staff worker \nagainst resident SV, who uses a wheelchair. In April 2007, the staff worker observed SV \nstart to spit out medicine she had given to him.  The staff worker used demeaning names \nto address the resident and then held the resident’s head against the headrest on his \nwheelchair, forcing a spoon into his mouth; after that, she forcibly held a washcloth \nacross SV’s mouth, trying to make him swallow.  According to an eyewitness, this \nsituation continued for 10 minutes. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated verbal abuse of resident RU by a staffer in June 2007. \nWhile taking a resident’s blood sugar reading nearby, a nurse overheard a staffer talking \nto RU in the adjacent bathroom.  The nurse reported that the staff worker verbally abused \nRU while he was bathing, saying: “God damn it, don’t you know how to take a bath?” \nAs the resident began to cry, the staffer then said: “So now you think you are going to \ncry like a b__ch and that is not going to help you out one bit. Let’s get this done.” \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated abuse of a 20-year-old female resident, QT, by a male \nstaff worker who was reported to be “obsessed” with her. In November 2006, the male \nstaffer shaved the pubic area of the young female resident.  Other staff workers regarded \nthis as inappropriate, yet this incident was not reported for five days. \n•\t In February 2007, an internet website moderator alerted BSDC officials to a web journal, \npublished by a new staff member, that identified both staff and residents, described \nunauthorized confinement of one resident in a tightly-wrapped comforter ostensibly to \nprevent movement, and the stated desire of one staffer “to kill” a resident due to \nfrustration. The blogger also alleged that another staff worker sat on a resident “to calm \n[the resident] . . . down,” and that a senior staffer told the journal writer that “you have to \n\n- 6 -\nbe a “b__ch” to the clients for them to know you’re in charge.”  BSDC investigators \nfound that these acts and the publication of such information constituted abuse and \nneglect of the residents.4 \nIn September 2007, resident PS suffered a spiral fracture of his lower leg.  Spiral \nfractures are typically an indication of purposeful twisting and a marker for possible abuse. \nHowever, the facility did not list a cause of the injury or a possible witness to the injury.  Indeed, \nthe facility categorizes a large number of incidents/injuries among BSDC residents as of \n“unknown” origin. In general, a significant number of unknown injuries at an institution \nsuggests an unsafe environment and one where supervision is inadequate to protect residents \nfrom harm; at worst, it reveals hidden abuse.  At BSDC, internal documents reveal that, between \nJanuary 1, 2007 and September 30, 2007, there were at least 1,126 incidents/injuries of unknown \ncause, representing over one-fourth of all incidents recorded during that period. \nb.\t Neglect \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated neglect by a direct care worker who, in August 2007, \nfailed to bathe, check, change diapers, or re-position six residents assigned to her care; \ninstead, BSDC investigators found that the staffer watched television and slept during her \nwork shift. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated neglect where, in August 2007, four staff workers in \none unit failed to check or change resident OR for four-and-a-half hours. During that \ntime, none of the staff re-positioned the resident, interacted with him, completed his \ntreatments, or conducted his programs.  The staff of the next shift discovered OR to be \nsoiled and completely soaked in urine, through his clothes. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated neglect where, in July 2007, two staffers had placed \nresident NQ in her bed for a nap and then left with four other residents for a trip to a \nsoftball game.  The resident, who should have been checked and changed every two \nhours by staff on duty, was discovered five hours later still in her bed in the same attire as \nbefore, with her clothes and bedding soaked in urine. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated neglect after a BSDC housekeeper discovered, in June \n2007, that resident MP had been left in her bed, alone in the building for at least 30 \nminutes, while the unit staff and other residents were away at activities across campus. \n4  During our on-site tour, one of our expert consultants observed an incident that later \nmay have been substantiated as abuse by BSDC officials.  Specifically, our consultant observed \na staff member physically preventing a resident from independently moving his wheelchair; she \nalso observed the staff member yelling at the resident to keep away from a table where other \nresidents were eating. Our consultant immediately alerted BSDC officials of the incident. \n\n- 7 -\nThe investigation describes a chaotic scene on the living unit where residents were \ncounted and miscounted by staff unfamiliar with them. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated neglect where, in June 2007, a direct care staff worker \nimproperly cared for resident LO whose ileostomy bag5 had come open.  The staffer, \nuntrained in this type of care, merely took the resident to the bathroom, placed him on the \ntoilet, and left him there alone.  The nurse who came by 20-30 minutes later to replace \nthe bag noted that the direct care staff worker was watching television.  She found LO \nstill on the toilet with feces on his body, his clothing, and on the bathroom floor. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated neglect where, in May 2007, resident KN, requiring \nclose 1:1 supervision within a distance of five feet, eloped from his BSDC living unit; he \nwas later found at an apartment complex away from the campus.  Staff on the unit were \nunaware that this particular resident required 1:1 staffing. \n•\t In April 2007, one staff worker was left alone on a living unit to care for 16 residents. \nResident YM, who requires supervision within visual range, eloped from the building and \nwas later found in a campus driveway with one of his wheelchair’s wheels caught on the \ncurb. BSDC’s investigation was unable to determine for how long YM had been outside \nthe building before staff noticed him.  BSDC investigators substantiated that the assigned \nstaff worker had neglected the resident.  The practice of leaving residents alone and \nunsupervised was found in a number of other abuse and neglect investigations as well.  In \naddition to lapses in supervision, BSDC residents also sustained injuries due to staff \nbeing unaware of residents’ support needs. \n•\t BSDC investigators substantiated neglect where, in April 2007, resident KN may have \nsexually assaulted another resident who was to have been closely supervised. The \nvictim’s program required assigned facility staff to check on him at least once every 30 \nminutes.  However, BSDC investigators determined that no such checks had been done, \nconcluding: “[h]ad the checks been done, [staff] would have interrupted the incident or \nprevented it.” \n•\t In early March 2007, within a 24-hour period, a BSDC staff worker twice failed to report \nthat she saw resident IL chewing on pieces of his colostomy bag.  In one of these \nincidents, the resident had smeared feces on his face, body, and mouth.  Although the \nneglect charge was substantiated against this staff person, she remained employed at \nBSDC and continued to be assigned responsibility for IL’s support and care. Less than \ntwo months later, the same staff person was again found negligent in caring for IL. \n5  An ileostomy bag is a plastic or latex bag attached to the body for collection of urine or \nfecal material after an ileostomy or cystoplasty. \n\n- 8 \n-\n2.  Incidents and Injuries \nWe found that BSDC’s risk management practices fail to identify residents’ risks and fail \nto implement preventive strategies necessary to keep residents from harm and risk of harm. \nIndeed, BSDC documents reveal that residents regularly experience harm and risk of harm in \ntheir day-to-day lives. Facility records indicate that for the period between September 1, 2006 \nand October 12, 2007, there were thousands of separate recorded incidents involving residents at \nBSDC. The facility produced a 240-page list of what we estimate to be over six thousand \nseparate incidents during this period. Other BSDC documents reveal 4,328 separate resident \nincidents at BSDC in 2007 alone (through September).  \nWhile some of these incidents were relatively minor with no injury to residents, others \nwere very serious and produced grave injuries. Through the end of September 2007, BSDC \ndocumented 3,306 incidents where there was at least a “minor” injury to residents.  This works \nout to be an average of about 367 resident injuries per month, or about 85 resident injuries per \nweek, or about 12 resident injuries per day at BSDC.  During the period between September 1, \n2006 and October 12, 2007, BSDC identified about 150 incidents as more serious or severe than \na “minor” injury.  Serious injuries include fractures, lacerations, bites, and choking incidents.  \nSome residents have been involved in multiple incidents.  Through December 30, BSDC \nreported an average of 35 residents per quarter who were involved in 10 or more \nincidents/injuries last year. Residents GJ, FI, EH, and DG all averaged more than 20 \nincidents/injuries per quarter through September 2007. \na.  Resident Aggression \nA large number of resident-to-resident incidents at BSDC stem from resident aggression. \nFrom September 1, 2006 through October 15, 2007, BSDC identified over 100 different \nresidents who were characterized as “aggressors” in well over 500 separate incidents. In 2007 \nalone, through September, BSDC identified resident aggression as the probable cause of 217 \nseparate incidents that produced at least a “minor” injury.  The injuries of aggression to victim \nresidents, include lacerations, bite marks, scratches, scrapes, bruises, and abrasions.  \nSome of the incidents have been serious.  For example, in September 2006, resident CF \nattacked her roommate, HK, with a four-inch steak knife.  HK sustained a laceration to her left \ntemple and upper arm, and a stab wound to her lower left back.  After the attack, the victim was \n“crying and in near hysterics.” CF told staff that “voices” made her attack HK and that she \nwanted to kill her roommate and “everyone on the living unit.”  On the Monday prior to this \nincident, CF’s mother reported that a knife of similar description was missing from her home \nafter CF’s visit.  The internal BSDC investigation does not indicate whether staff searched CF’s \nroom for the knife after the home visit and prior to the stabbing incident.  In spite of this, BSDC \nmade no finding of neglect.  In a separate incident a month later, resident BE alleged that his \nroommate, TO, had sexually assaulted him in the bathroom.  BE suffered injuries to his neck and \nlip. However, no physical evidence of a sexual assault was found. The internal BSDC \n\n- 9 \n-\ninvestigation did not reach a definitive conclusion as to what happened.  BSDC made no findings \nas to abuse or neglect with regard to this incident. \nBSDC records reveal that resident aggression incidents/injuries appear to be concentrated \non certain units, such as 104K and 408S.6  Lack of adequate staff supervision, environmental and \nsafety concerns, as well as a failure to provide adequate behavior and mental health supports all \ncontribute to an increased risk of harm for many residents on a day-to-day basis. \nb.\t Fractures and Falls \nIn the year before our visit, a number of BSDC residents suffered fractures, including \nfractures of the leg, hip, knee, ankle, toe, clavicle, shoulder, arm, hand, finger, and nose.  Many \nof the fractures were quite serious, requiring the intervention of an orthopedic surgeon.  It is of \nconcern that about half the time, BSDC did not know how the fracture happened.  We set forth \nbelow a few examples of residents who suffered fractures in the months prior to our visit. \n•\t In April 2007, staff noted a bruise on resident AD’s arm while preparing the resident for \na bath. Later it was determined that AD had suffered a fracture of the right humerus. \nAlthough a physician concluded that the injury was the result of blunt force trauma, it \nremains undetermined how and where the fracture occurred. \n•\t In March 2007, resident LA refused to bear weight on his left leg.  The next day, staff \nobserved bruising to the resident’s ankle, but an x-ray showed no fracture.  A subsequent \nx-ray, done a week later, showed an oblique fracture through the left distal fibula.  The \ncause of the fracture is undetermined. \n•\t In January 2007, while attempting to transfer resident KZ from her wheelchair to her bed, \na BSDC staff worker was unable to lift the resident onto the bed, and instead lowered her \nto the floor. The following day, other staff noticed a “pop and crackling” sound as they \ntried to dress KZ. Subsequent medical examination identified a fracture to the resident’s \nlower leg. \nResident fractures are often caused by falls. Indeed, there is a significant and serious \npattern of resident falls at BSDC, numbering more that 1,000 since September 2006.  The facility \nhas documented repeated falls by a number of residents: GJ - 50 falls, FI - 45 falls, EH - 43 falls, \nND - 25 falls, DG - 25 falls, OE - 24 falls, and PF - 23 falls. The high frequency of falls places \nthese and other similarly situated residents at great risk of harm.  Yet, too often, BSDC has failed \nto develop effective safeguards to reduce the frequency of resident falls. Some falls have \nresulted in significant harm to residents.  For example: \n6 Units 104K and 408S are just two of several units that house residents with \ndevelopmental disabilities who also have behavioral problems and/or mental illness. \n\n- 10 \n-\n•\t In late July, 2007, staff noted a significant purple bruise to resident QG’s left shoulder \nduring bathing. Examination revealed a fracture of the left humerus.  Although medical \nstaff felt the injury was caused “by blunt force trauma,” BSDC concluded that the injury \nwas accidental, possibly from an unwitnessed fall. \n•\t In July 2007, resident MC fell, suffering what appeared to be a fracture of his left \nclavicle; staff noted significant purple bruising on his shoulder. \n•\t In June 2007, resident BF, known to have osteoporosis, fell while approaching the \nbathroom, suffering a left hip fracture.  In response to BF’s numerous falls, the BSDC \nIncident Review Team often recommended “no further action necessary.”  This response \nis similar to that given to other residents who fall regularly or are at risk of falling.  \nOur investigation revealed a pattern in which numerous residents suffered multiple falls, \nyet were not identified as individuals at-risk for falling. As a result, the facility failed to provide \nadequate preventive interventions. For example: \n•\t Resident UL, admitted in August 2006, suffered injuries from falls three times within her \nfirst month in residence at BSDC.  Despite her recurring falls, she was not identified as \nbeing at-risk for falls and protective measures were not implemented.  Within 75 days of \nher admission, she suffered her fifth fall, sustaining a fracture to her right thighbone \n(femur).  This fracture required surgery to implant a fixture pin.  The investigation of this \nfall failed to identify a pattern and UL continued to fall in subsequent months.  \n•\t Resident PF fell at least 23 times between September 2006 and June 2007, but was not \nidentified as at-risk for falling by BSDC. One of his falls caused a laceration to his head \nwhich required staples to close. In early 2007, PF suffered a fractured finger on his left \nhand. As of mid-October 2007, BSDC had still failed to identify PF as at-risk for falls. \n•\t Resident DW, referenced above, began to fall with increasing frequency around October \n2006. She fell about a dozen times from October 2006 to July 2007.  Despite this, as of \nmid-October 2007, BSDC had still failed to identify DW as at-risk for falls. \nThere are many other residents who have incurred serious injuries from falls, and yet, are \nnot identified by BSDC as being at-risk of falling, including: QH, KZ, BF, RI, SJ, TK, and NQ. \nBSDC’s failure to identify individuals’ risks and implement preventive strategies places \nresidents at significant and continuing risk of harm. \nc.\t Lacerations \nA large number of BSDC residents have suffered lacerations, many of which are deep \nand serious. The facility identified about four dozen residents who, during the year before our \nvisit, had suffered a laceration that required sutures, staples, clips, or dermabond to close the \ninjury. About 95 percent of the serious lacerations involved injury to the face or head. Some of \n\n- 11 \n-\nthe residents suffered multiple deep lacerations; for example, throughout the year, resident DG \nsuffered separate deep injuries near her right eyebrow, her left eyebrow, the bridge of her nose, \nand her upper nose. Most of the resident injuries appear to occur due to inadequately addressed \nbehaviors – sometimes from self-injury, and sometimes from the unchecked aggression of \nanother resident. Other causes of lacerations include falls, environmental factors, and seizures. \nd.\t Choking Risks \nMany BSDC residents have medical conditions that seriously complicate the swallowing \nand digesting of their food and beverages. We uncovered several instances in which staff failed \nto adequately protect residents from consuming food or fluids that could cause them serious \nharm.  For example: \n•\t Resident VM, fed via stomach tube, is assigned enhanced supervision due to her high risk \nfor aspiration. Despite this, in April 2007, VM’s staff left her alone in the dayroom, \nwhere she drank a cup of liquid set out for another resident.  This was the fifth time since \n2004 that the resident has consumed an edible or liquid that placed her at serious risk of \nharm.  The subsequent review of this incident noted that, “[the resident’s] consumption of \nfood could cause serious airway blockage, anoxia, and death; her consumption of liquids \ncould lead to aspiration of the contents into her lungs. It is imperative that [she] receive \nthe proper supervision to guard against her ingestion of food or liquid.” Within weeks, in \nJuly 2007, staff found the same resident in the dining area chewing corn chips.  BSDC \nfound that an on-call staff worker in that instance neglected her by leaving his assignment \nbefore arranging for her supervision. BSDC’s repeated failure to protect VM places her \nat serious risk. \n•\t BSDC investigators confirmed neglect where, in July 2007, resident WN, also fed by a \nstomach tube and not allowed food or drink due to the risk of aspiration, walked over to a \ntable in his living unit and drank tea left there.  No specific staff had been assigned to \nsupervise this resident at the time despite his need for enhanced supervision.  The \ninvestigative report also noted a prior incident on May 6, 2007, where this resident drank \ngrape juice, which also placed him at serious risk for aspiration. \nIn addition, a couple of other residents have ingested inedible objects that posed great \nrisk to the resident; resident OK swallowed a push-pin tack, and resident CF may have \nswallowed a “train” game piece. \n3.\t Incident Reporting, Investigations, and Preventive Measures \na.\t Incidents \nWe identified a number of problems with the facility’s incident management system. \nBSDC’s policies and procedures related to reporting and categorizing incidents are disjointed, \nuncoordinated, and confusing. As a result, incidents are not consistently categorized at BSDC. \n\n- 12 \n-\nDuring our visit, we learned that multiple databases at BSDC hold information about harm to \nresidents. We learned from a variety of sources that all incidents are not tracked in the same \ndatabase. For example, the Quality Indicator Report that should contain accurate information, \nand is to be reviewed quarterly, does not include hundreds of falls experienced by residents and \ndocumented elsewhere.  We also found that important incident reports sometimes are not \naccounted for in the tracking system.  We identified instances where staff failed to report \nincidents in a timely manner.  This raises concerns about whether other important incidents are \nbeing reported on time or at all.  As a result, we do not have confidence that the incident \ninformation recorded and reported at BSDC accurately reflects all of the reportable incidents that \nactually occur at the facility.  Given these failures, the incident and injury numbers we set forth \nabove may, in fact, under-represent the harm that has actually occurred at the facility.  This also \nmakes the tracking and trending of such incidents unreliable, which further impairs the facility’s \nability to develop and implement individual or systemic remedial measures.  It is essential that \nmanagement staff have reliable data sources that will allow them to review trends and analyze \nand address the underlying causes of all injuries. \nThe BSDC Incident Review Team (IRT), chaired by the acting director of quality \nmanagement, reviews all incidents that have occurred within the previous 24 hours.  The intent \nbehind this effort is commendable.  However, there are some concerns.  For example, the \nresidents’ interdisciplinary team members are notably missing from this review process. \nMoreover, although the IRT serves the function of keeping facility management informed of \nsentinel events, this process actually delays the interdisciplinary teams’ response to events and \nshifts the accountability for resident safety from the QMRP and interdisciplinary team to the \nfacility management staff.  Since the IRT does not necessarily possess in-depth knowledge of the \nresidents’ status, it is ultimately dependent on the team to determine intervention strategies to \nreduce risk. \nThe facility’s lack of effective risk management and incident management practices \nplaces residents at risk of serious harm.  It is imperative that the facility establish both preventive \nand responsive processes that proactively work to reduce and eliminate harm.  \nb.  Investigations \nWe found some positive aspects with regard to recently-begun remedial efforts in the \narea of internal investigations. BSDC has demonstrated its intent to broaden the scope of its \ninvestigative process. Based on the volume of investigations from 2006 to 2007, the facility has \nincreased the number of incidents it formally investigates.  In addition, BSDC’s investigative \nunit has made considerable improvements in identifying systemic and ancillary issues relevant to \ninvestigations. Systemic issues are more consistently identified with meaningful corrective \nactions assigned. \nNonetheless, the facility must continue to correct deficiencies and improve the quality of \nits investigations in order to reach minimally accepted standards of practice.  We found that there \nwere significant delays in reporting some allegations of abuse and neglect.  Similarly, there were \n\n- 13 \n-\ndelays in providing relevant documents to the investigator in some cases.  Investigators did not \nconsistently secure evidentiary materials.  Investigations often lack necessary components.  For \nexample, some investigations failed to:  reconcile evidence appropriately, develop a chronology \nof the event, identify involved personnel, include interviews of all relevant staff and residents \nwho may have information about the incident in question, and determine the cause of serious \nincidents. Many investigations fail to develop a reasoned analysis of what actually happened \nand who was responsible. In some instances, the investigative report does not discuss how \ninformation that was gathered was utilized to draw conclusions.  We also found instances where \ninvestigations were filled with speculative commentary by both staff and investigators, \napparently set forth to rationalize why a more thorough review of the allegation was not \nnecessary. A speculative approach and lack of objectivity is a significant departure from \nminimally acceptable standards of practice. \nInadequate investigations make it difficult for the facility to identify, develop, and \nimplement corrective measures to eliminate preventable risks to residents.  BSDC documents \nreveal that many corrective measures that were supposed to be implemented post-investigation to \nprevent future incidents are not being implemented and monitored in a timely or adequate \nmanner.  Such failures place residents at ongoing risk of harm.  Subsequent investigations \nindicate recurrent issues that have not been resolved. Our safety consultant concluded that \nBSDC is not monitoring the effectiveness of corrective actions with any regularity, and as a \nresult, “recurring issues are illuminated through investigations though they rarely appear \nresolved.” \n4.  Staffing Concerns \nMany of the deficiencies at BSDC with regard to safety are linked to staffing difficulties.  \nOur safety consultant characterized the BSDC workforce as “wrought with exhaustion and \ndiscontent.” She reported that some employees pleaded for help in order to acquire adequate \nstaffing assistance for the health and welfare of the residents.  During our visit, BSDC staff \nexpressed concerns about being assigned to work with residents without being trained on how to \nproperly support and care for them.  They also told us about their concerns related to unsafe \nworking conditions due to severe staff shortages, employee exhaustion, lack of adequate \ntraining, and disgruntled co-workers. \nThe facility faces substantial and ongoing struggles in hiring and retaining competent \nstaff, maintaining acceptable individual-to-employee staffing ratios, and providing adequate time \noff to full-time employees.  During the week of our visit in October 2007, the facility had \nvacancies in 117 of 411 direct care staff positions. In addition to these, there were vacancies for \na physician, six nurses, a nurse supervisor, a physical therapist, two team leaders, and two \ncompliance specialists.  Many of these positions had been unfilled for months.   \nGiven the large number of staff vacancies, the facility has relied heavily on requiring \ncurrent staff to work overtime.  BSDC records reveal that direct care staff have been working \novertime – sometimes on double shifts – for more than a year now.  The facility used 10,219 \n\n- 14 \n-\nhours of overtime in September 2007, and 14,490 hours in August 2007.  These levels are \nreduced from the January 2007 high of almost 20,000 overtime hours in the month.  For the \nperiod September 2006 through September 2007, the facility spent $3.6 million on overtime \nreimbursement.  Overtime is often mandatory for current BSDC staff.  We spoke to numerous \nstaff who related their concerns about having to work multiple double-shifts (16 consecutive \nhours) within a single week to provide care to residents.  Many staff workers expressed their \nweariness at being “frozen,” or required to stay for additional shifts or risk disciplinary action for \nfailure to fulfill overtime requirements.  \nEven with staff working so many additional hours, we learned that the use of overtime is \noften not enough to meet staffing needs.  As a result, the facility maintains a roster of 180 \nDevelopmental Technician I employees who are described as “on-call” staff.  These employees \n(including staff as young as 16 years of age) are assigned to work with residents across the \ncampus as needed.  However, many of these on-call staff are unfamiliar with the residents they \nare assigned to serve. Although all staff, including the on-call staff, are supposed to be familiar \nwith the needs and individualized plans of the residents on their assigned units, we met staff \nworkers who were unable to tell us that information, much less implement the plans.  \nIn addition to the large number of staff vacancies, we found a lack of adequate oversight \nof staff. We uncovered several instances where staff were found asleep while on duty and where \nstaff were found to be playing cards or watching television when they should have been \nproviding services to residents. One supervisor told us that she was new to her area and did not \nknow which staff were assigned to her area from day-to-day.  The chaotic staff environment at \nBSDC fragments care to residents and places them at risk of additional harm.  \nNeedless to say, the demands of current BSDC staffing practices place both emotional \nand physical stress on the staff that may lead to an environment that is more conducive to abuse, \nneglect, and mistreatment.  At the very least, tired and over-worked staff will be less likely to \ntake the initiative and responsibility necessary to provide residents with the programming, care, \nand treatment they need, especially if the residents have difficult behaviors or complex health \ncare needs. BSDC needs to take deliberate action to improve this situation.  Failure to do so will \ncontinue the current environment that is conducive to abuse, neglect, and inadequate care. \n5.  Documentation \nClinical records at BSDC do not consistently provide an accurate account of residents’ \nneeds. Moreover, there is inconsistency among the tools utilized at BSDC to provide staff with \ninformation on the current intervention strategies to protect individuals from harm.  We found \nthat there was conflicting information on such tools as supervision cards, individualized program \nplans, and mental health treatment plans. \nWe also found that outcome data for interventions was often inaccurate.  Record reviews \nat BSDC revealed significant discrepancies between unit and clinical data, as well as a general \ninconsistency in maintaining data.  Because this data is to be used in clinical decision-making, \n\n- 15 \n-\nthe health and well-being of individuals is placed at significant risk when clinical records and \ndata reports contain errors, discrepancies, and inconsistencies. \nBSDC is currently making efforts to form committees to better analyze outcome data. \nWhile this is a worthwhile effort, it is only one element of a complete quality assurance system. \nQuality assurance needs to be more than a department at BSDC; it needs to be a deliberate and \nongoing practice at the facility. \nB.\t TRAINING AND BEHAVIORAL SERVICES, RESTRAINTS, AND \nPSYCHIATRIC CARE \nThe Supreme Court has concluded that for persons with developmental disabilities \nresiding in state institutions, there is a constitutional right to “minimally adequate training.” \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. at 322. Specifically, “the minimally adequate training required \nby the Constitution is such training as may be reasonable in light of [the institutionalized \nperson’s] liberty interests in safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints.”  Id. and at 319 \n(“respondent’s liberty interests require the State to provide minimally adequate or reasonable \ntraining to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint”). \n1.\t Resident Behaviors and Behavior Programs \nDozens of residents at BSDC have behavior problems and need training and associated \nbehavioral services.  According to facility documents, as of August 31, 2007, there were 151 \nresidents with physical aggression, 68 residents with verbal aggression, 41 residents with non-\nverbal/physical aggression, and 74 with self-injurious behavior.  Some residents exhibit multiple \nbehavior problems; 34 residents are listed with three of these behaviors and 15 residents are \nlisted with all four behaviors. \nAs of September 4, 2007, the facility reports that approximately 187 BSDC residents \n(including the 11 Bridges residents) with behavior problems receive training and associated \npsychological and behavioral services through a formal behavior program.  Generally accepted \npractice, as well as BSDC policy, mandates that behavior programs are to provide a consistent, \nindividualized, and effective approach to reduce or eliminate inappropriate behaviors.  In spite of \nthis, BSDC fails to provide training and services that are adequate and appropriate to meet the \nneeds of these residents. This deficiency contributes to poor resident outcomes, including poor \nprogress in treating problem behaviors, increased risk for highly restrictive interventions, \nincreased risk for injury and abuse, and decreased opportunities for placement in the most \nintegrated setting. Inadequate training and psychological services are contributing factors to \nmany of the incidents and injuries discussed above, which often stem from residents’ \ninadequately addressed problem behaviors, such as physical aggression, verbal aggression, self-\ninjurious behavior, or “pica” (ingesting inedible objects). \nBSDC behavior programs are typically well-developed, often rather lengthy, and \ngenerally follow a consistent format.  Nonetheless, the programs often do not effectively address \n\n- 16 \n-\nresidents’ often difficult behavior problems.  With regard to behavioral assessments, BSDC \nrelies too heavily on a brief questionnaire screening tool when a more extensive observational \nanalysis of the behavior problem is often warranted to verify functional behavioral antecedents \nand lead to appropriate treatment options and follow-up services and supports.  This is especially \ntrue in complex cases where subtleties may be missed and behavioral intervention may be \nmisguided.  Appropriate observational analysis is even more important, given that BSDC quality \nassurance documents reveal data collection problems associated with resident behaviors.  Data is \nmissing on some days, shifts, and hours, or is not recorded up to the current time or interval. \nImproper or incomplete data collection can negatively impact initial assessments and progress \nre-assessments, which can influence service delivery.  It also does not appear that residents’ \nbehavior programs are updated frequently enough to address changes in residents’ behaviors \nthroughout the course of the year. As we discuss below, this is especially notable with regard to \nresidents who are continually subjected to invasive restraints. \nThe overriding and primary problem at BSDC, however, is not so much with the paper \nprograms as it is with the inadequate implementation of the paper.  Consistent and correct \nimplementation of adequate and appropriate behavior programs is required if progress is to be \nmade on the behavior programs.  Yet, staff at BSDC fail to properly implement the written \nbehavior programs for the residents.  This is a pervasive problem that implicates staff across all \nshifts and settings. Poor implementation of programming places BSDC residents with behavior \nproblems at risk of continued harm, continued exposure to restrictive intervention procedures, \nand continued institutionalization. \nThere are many reasons for implementation deficiencies.  Staff vacancies are a \ncontributing factor. Our psychology consultant characterized the large number of staff vacancies \nat BSDC as a “huge gap in staff.” The loss of experienced staff and the high rate of staff \nturnover are also taking their toll. The behavior programs at BSDC involve multiple distinct \nsteps or procedures. New staff, temporary staff, “on-call” staff, or staff pulled from other units \nare often unfamiliar with the particulars of the lengthy and detailed individual behavior \nprograms.  This leads to faulty implementation.  Even with regular staff though, it is too often \nthe case that they are not familiar enough with the programs to implement them correctly.  Our \npsychology consultant concluded that “[l]ack of experienced trained staff to work with the \ndifficult complex cases that I reviewed can have a devastating effect on the quality of behavior \nprogram implementation.”  He added that “the presence of adequate staff was highly correlated \nwith calmness of the [BSDC living] unit.”  \nWhen confronted with a resident behavior, generally accepted practice and BSDC policy \nrequire staff to systematically work through a progression of less restrictive techniques before \napplying more invasive measures.  However, instead of methodically and properly implementing \nthe written program, harried staff in a behavioral crisis too often and too quickly resort to \nreactive procedures. The facility staff often do not move systematically through the BSDC \ncontinuum of interventions from least restrictive intervention to more restrictive intervention as \nrequired by State policy. Fundamental program elements, such as modification of antecedents or \nattempts at prevention, including gently talking to the individuals or redirecting them from the \n\n- 17 \n-\nenvironment, are not employed properly or as often as needed.  Instead, facility records reveal a \nrather consistent reaction to behavioral problems, where staff quickly move from behavior \nresponse blocking to physical restraints to mechanical restraints.  \nAs a result of the failure of behavioral training at BSDC, the residents with problem \nbehaviors, as well as those in their proximity, have remained at risk of harm due to the \nconsequences of the unchecked problem behaviors.  The resident-to-resident aggression we \nreferenced above is one example of this.  Because the problem behaviors continue, these \nresidents are then subjected to other means of control, such as the use of highly restrictive \ninterventions, including emergency mechanical restraints. \n2.  Restraints \nThe Supreme Court has recognized that the right to be free from unreasonable bodily \nrestraint is the “core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary \ngovernmental action.”  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. at 316, 322 (citing Greenholtz v. Inmates \nof Neb. Penal and Corr. Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 18).7 See also 42 C.F.R. § 483.13(a)(resident “has \nthe right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints . . . not required to treat the \nresident’s medical symptoms.”).   Consistent with generally accepted professional practices, \nrestraints are to be used only when justified and only when there is evidence that less restrictive \nprocedures have been proven ineffective or are unsafe. \nThe State subjects BSDC residents to undue restraints. From June 1, 2006 to August 31, \n2007, the State reports that 79 BSDC residents, approximately 25 percent of the population, were \nrestrained. Restraints at BSDC can range from a physical restraint where a staff member \nphysically holds a resident’s head, limb(s), and/or body, all the way to a mechanical restraint (the \nmost invasive form of restraint) where staff use cloth and leather straps to tie to a bed a \nresident’s four limbs and sometimes his or her chest.  Commonly used behavior management \nprocedures at BSDC are very restrictive and pose significant risk of injury to BSDC residents. \nThese highly restrictive interventions include: mechanical restraint devices that involve 2-point \nor 3-point restraints (arms and/or legs), 4-point restraints (arms and legs), or 5-point restraints \n(arms and legs and the upper or lower body).  These interventions may be used either on a \nprogrammatic or on an emergency basis.  The facility staff also engage in the highly restrictive \npractice of physical holds that allow up to three staff members to lift and carry a resident against \nhis or her will. \n7  The Supreme Court has held that this interest is fully applicable to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities who are confined to state institutions.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at \n316. The Court noted that the state is under a duty to provide an institutionalized person with a \ndevelopmental disability with reasonable training “to ensure his safety and to facilitate his ability \nto function free from bodily restraints.  It may well be unreasonable not to provide training when \ntraining could significantly reduce the need for restraints or the likelihood of violence.” Id. at \n324. \n\n- 18 -\nOur psychology consultant concluded that restraint usage at BSDC is high. Indeed, he \nlabeled mechanical restraint usage at BSDC as “the highest in frequency and duration that I have \nseen in my experience.”  Our safety consultant characterized as “alarming and disconcerting” the \nrisks associated with the duration and frequency with which several residents are placed in \nrestraints. The specific restraint numbers at BSDC are rather staggering: \n•\t During the period from June 1, 2006 to August 31, 2007, the State reports that there were \n896 total restraint episodes; this represents an average of about 60 restraint episodes \nevery month at BSDC. \n•\t During this period, resident HK was restrained 104 times, resident OK was restrained 70 \ntimes, resident PL was restrained 49 times, resident CF was restrained 48 times, and \nresident UL was restrained 43 times.  There were 17 other residents who were restrained \na dozen or more times during this period.  \n•\t The use of the most invasive form of restraint – mechanical restraints – is quite prevalent \nat BSDC. During the 15-month period referenced above, BSDC staff placed residents in \nemergency or programmatic mechanical restraints (i.e., those utilized pursuant to a \nbehavior program) for a total of 41,168 minutes, or over 686 hours.  The use of \nprogrammatic invasive restraints alone averaged about 44 hours per month.  \n•\t Many of the individual restraint episodes have been very lengthy, with some lasting \nseveral hours at a time.  During this period, 24 residents were subjected to at least one \ninvasive mechanical restraint episode of two consecutive hours or more.  \n•\t Resident RM was placed in mechanical restraints for two hours or more a total of 26 \ntimes during this period.  Many other residents suffered through mechanical restraints for \ntwo hours or more:  resident PL, 22 times; resident OK, 21 times; resident HK, 15 times; \nresident EH, 14 times; and residents CF and SN, 9 times each.  \n•\t During this period, there were 65 separate instances where staff subjected residents to \nmechanical restraints of three hours or more; of these, 22 separate instances lasted five or \nmore consecutive hours; of these, seven lasted seven or more consecutive hours. \n•\t In late October 2006, in response to what was characterized as “edgy” behavior where a \nresident was hitting, kicking, scratching, and biting, staff placed the resident in four-point \nrestraints for a total of 23 hours and 41 minutes straight (with one ten-minute break just \nbefore the 12-hour mark).  Staff noted that this resident may have been craving additional \nattention, which apparently was denied him other than in the context of a restraint \napplication. \n•\t During this period, resident RM was placed in invasive mechanical restraints for a total \nof 8,618 minutes, or over 143 hours.  Resident OK was placed in such restraints for about \n85 hours; resident PL for over 75 hours; and resident HK for over 65 hours. \n\n- 19 \n-\n•\t Staff subjected seven BSDC residents to emergency mechanical restraints during this \ntime for over 1,000 total minutes.  All but three of the individual restraint applications \nlasted for an hour or more; resident TO was placed in emergency mechanical restraints \nfor five hours on one occasion and over three hours on another. \n•\t During this period, mechanical restraint usage prompted 49 separate facility critical \nincident reviews involving over a dozen residents. \nOur safety consultant concluded that injuries sustained during restraints are “increasing \nrapidly at BSDC and are indicative of a systemic problem at the facility.”  She concluded that \nBSDC’s inability to protect residents from harm prior to and during the restraint application is a \nsignificant departure from minimally accepted standards of practice. \nWhile the facility has a restraint review committee that meets regularly to review the use \nof restraints on certain individuals, it does not appear to be having much impact on the use of \nrestraints at the facility, especially with regard to residents with difficult behavior problems. \nThese timely meetings are characterized by a general sensitivity to the need to reduce restraints. \nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that insightful professional input is always presented at \nthese meetings or that action steps are developed that will lead to more effective behavioral \ninterventions for residents. \nSeparately, as we discuss below, several converging factors, in addition to behavioral \nservice deficiencies, produce an environment where resident behaviors and restraints are likely \nto occur; these include: an overly restrictive segregated living environment characterized by \ncrowded conditions with almost constant close exposure to other residents prone to behaviors; \nlack of adequate habilitation and meaningful community activities during the day; and issues \nrelated to the provision of psychiatric care for those with mental illness.       \n3.\t Overly Restrictive Environment \nThe overly restrictive physical environment of the BSDC institution limits behavioral \ntreatment options.  Crowding in some residential units causes tension and increases the \nlikelihood that behavior problems will arise, especially where two or more aggressive residents \nare in close physical proximity to one another for virtually the entire day and night.  Our \npsychology consultant informed us that none of the aggressive residents he talked to during the \nweek said that they had a friend on their unit. He concluded that “confining people who are \npredisposed to aggression and who do not like one another in the close quarters of the living \nunits of BSDC is a program for trouble.”  \nMoreover, the facility has not done enough to integrate residents into community \nsettings, as discussed below. One consequence is that residents have limited opportunities to \nassociate with people who may be role models for socially appropriate behavior.  This is most \n\n- 20 \n-\neasily accomplished through community placement and/or integrated and meaningful activities \nduring the day, including supported employment and positive behavioral support activities. \nIronically, the facility’s overcrowded and confining environment and its failure to \nadequately address residents’ problem behaviors makes it more difficult for many of these \nresidents to transition to more integrated community settings or to participate in more integrated \nday activities. The treatment plans of some residents reveal that interdisciplinary teams at BSDC \nat times appear reluctant to recommend a resident for placement or services in a more integrated \ncommunity setting if the resident has significant problem behaviors.  This is tragic because many \nresidents were transferred to BSDC for the sole purpose of ameliorating their problem behaviors. \n4.  Habilitation, Vocational Activities, and Meaningful and Integrated Day Activities \nPersons with developmental disabilities are to receive adequate habilitation training and \nrelated vocational and day program services and supports so that they may acquire new skills, \ngrow and develop, and enhance their independence. Federal law requires that: \nEach client must receive a continuous active treatment program, which includes \naggressive, consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training, \ntreatment, health services and related services . . . that is directed toward – [t]he \nacquisition of the behaviors necessary for the client to function with as much self \ndetermination and independence as possible; and . . . [t]he prevention or deceleration of \nregression or loss of current optimal functional status. \n42 C.F.R. § 483.440(a). Indeed, both the BSDC habilitation and behavior program policies \nstress the need to help residents attain and increase skills in direct response to each individual’s \nneeds and personal outcomes.  However, BSDC fails to provide its residents with such adequate \nhabilitation training and related services and supports. \nOur psychology consultant noted that while “BSDC professes to be an active treatment \nfacility, . . . some staff appear not to buy into that mission.”  During our visit, we discovered a \nlow level of staff interaction with the residents throughout the day.  Too often, residents were not \nengaged, and the staff did not attempt to engage them in meaningful habilitation activities.  We \nfound several situations where nothing was happening with residents even though staff were \npresent. This lack of meaningful training and activity not only denies residents an opportunity to \nlearn and grow, but it can set the stage for the residents to engage in harmful behaviors.   \nEven at pleasant on-campus facilities, such as the Carstens Center, with a gym, a pool, a \nsocial center, and a game area, participation is rather limited.  BSDC logs reveal that, on many \ndays, only a handful of residents use the Carstens Center; “no-shows” for scheduled activities are \ncommon.  Facility records reveal that, in June 2007, almost 20 percent of the residents were \nlabeled as “no shows” for aquatic therapy. Quality assurance staff repeatedly labeled this a “big \nconcern.” Throughout the week of our visit, certain BSDC staff revealed that they hardly ever \ntake residents to the pool. It was not clear to staff why this was the case. Moreover, internal \n\n- 21 \n-\nquality assurance documents reveal that many staff do not interact with the residents when in \nplaces of habilitation and training, such as the social center or the gym.  Instead, staff sometimes \n“just sit and let the individuals run around hitting and throwing balls at each other.” At times, \nthere are not enough age-appropriate materials for training purposes.  \nPersons with developmental disabilities are to receive habilitation services in integrated \nsettings wherever possible.  See the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the \nrequirement that services be provided in the “most integrated setting.”  However, the State has \nfailed to provide adequate, meaningful, integrated activities in the community for BSDC \nresidents. No resident attends school off campus and no resident receives programming off \ncampus.  Only one resident works significant hours in a competitive, supported employment \nsetting in the community.  Instead of emphasizing community involvement, BSDC has \nconcentrated on providing work and programming to dozens of residents in various sheltered \nworkshop settings on the segregated campus.  Moreover, most of the work and programs on \ncampus involve rote and repetitive tasks.  \nWhile BSDC recently appears to have been making a positive effort to increase \noccasional community outings for BSDC residents, such as to the grocery store or to the park, \nthe number of residents who participate is limited, as are the number of days and hours per day \nthey can go to the community at any given time.  BSDC records reveal that, instead of going to \nthe community each day for several hours or most of the day, residents are typically able to go to \nthe community only a handful of times each month for just a couple of hours each time.  By \ncontrast, the ITS, which emphasizes the importance of individuals staying connected to the \ncommunity, is able to take the individuals enrolled in its program off campus much more \nregularly than the typical BSDC resident is able to go off campus.  We learned, for example, that \neach ITS resident goes off campus almost every day for several hours a day.  \nThus, the State appears to recognize the importance of community integration, but it has \nnot done enough to maximize residents’ day-to-day integration with the community at large \nbeyond the BSDC campus.  This is somewhat remarkable given that staff reported to us that \nresidents generally enjoy community trips; that typically resident behaviors and their overall \nwelfare and demeanor improve markedly when engaged in meaningful, integrated activities; and \nthat community involvement enhances learning.  Staff also informed us that restraint usage goes \ndown markedly once residents are in the community.  In any event, staffing, transportation, and \nthe availability of other resources appear to be limiting factors.  For example, even if every off-\ncampus BSDC vehicle was utilized at one time, about half of the residents could not be \naccommodated on community trips.  Moreover, BSDC has vehicle capacity only for fewer than \ntwo dozen residents who use wheelchairs. \n5.  Psychiatric Disorders and Treatment \nAs part of the interdisciplinary approach to addressing residents’ behavior problems, \ngenerally accepted practice requires that State-operated facilities like BSDC provide adequate \npsychiatric services for its residents with mental illness.  Traditionally, persons with \n\n- 22 \n-\ndevelopmental disabilities, who also have a dual diagnosis of mental illness, have been under-\ndiagnosed and over-medicated, especially if they lived in an institutional setting like BSDC.  In \nthe past, the inherent difficulty and complexity of identifying and treating the often subtle signs \nand symptoms of this population led to mistreatment or missed treatment; sometimes the need to \ngain control of problem behaviors led to clinically imposed chemical restraint.  The ongoing \ndangers associated with certain behavioral and psychiatric treatments for this population demand \ncontinued vigilance to protect against inertia and/or abuses against vulnerable persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities and mental illness. \nAs of September 13, 2007, the State reported that 167 BSDC residents had an Axis I \ndisorder diagnosis.8  The vast majority of these individuals have mental illness.  Several dozen \nresidents have more than one mental health diagnosis.  The State reports that 152 residents \nreceive at least one psychotropic medication.  Over 86 percent of all BSDC residents with a \nbehavior program also receive psychotropic medication.  \nIn spite of our overriding concerns, there are positive elements with regard to providing \npsychiatric care to BSDC residents: there is often frequent contact with residents by \nprofessionals responsible for providing mental health care; overall there is a thoughtful, multi-\ndisciplinary team approach to delivering mental health care; in conducting diagnostic \nassessments there is an effort to use objective information to guide clinical decision-making; and \nthe facility uses accepted monitoring tools to screen for psychotropic side effects and movement \ndisorders. Nonetheless, as we discuss below, too often, resident outcomes suffer because of \noutstanding deficiencies in this area. \nThe overriding deficiency is that there is currently not enough psychiatry time to provide \nadequate psychiatric care to meet the needs of BSDC residents with mental illness.  This places \nBSDC residents at risk of harm.  In the past, the BSDC residents were served by a psychiatrist \nwith nearly 20 years experience treating persons with developmental disabilities who was at the \nfacility on almost a full-time basis.  Now, the consulting psychiatrist to BSDC visits residents at \nthe facility on a limited and part-time basis, about two days per month.  Individual evaluation \nappointments typically appear to be scheduled in a range from about five minutes to 15 minutes \nfor each resident. (The team meetings conducted in the presence of our consultant psychiatrist \nlasted slightly longer.) Our psychology consultant concludes that this “simply is not enough \nexamination time for a thorough DSM assessment or even follow-up examination.  Much more \ntime evaluating each client is needed.”  Under his current contract, at most, the consulting \npsychiatrist can spend an average of about 69 minutes annually per resident with a current Axis I \n8  Pursuant to the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic criteria manual, Axis I \ndisorders are clinical disorders and/or other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention. \nTypically, these clinical disorders include mental illness.  Mental retardation and personality \ndisorders are classified as falling under Axis II.  The aggregate figure above does not include the \n11 persons at Bridges, all of whom have issues with regard to mental health treatment. \n\n- 23 \n-\ndiagnosis. Our psychiatry consultant concludes that this “would be considered insufficient for \neven the most stable patient in complete clinical remission.”  \nThe lack of sufficient psychiatry hours produces infrequent evaluation and assessment of \nresidents and less frequent follow-up than is needed. It also makes it more difficult to change \ntreatments that would be likely to require additional psychiatry time in the future than is \navailable under the current contract. We understand that the consulting psychiatrist is often not \nable to see every resident who has been referred to him that day for consultation.  As a result of \nall this, the BSDC primary care doctors, a physician assistant, and a registered nurse are now \nresponsible for providing a sizable volume of psychiatric follow-up care.  As our psychiatry \nconsultant concludes, “[o]ther clinicians can provide some mental health care and assessment for \nshort periods of time, but cannot substitute for psychiatric expertise for long term treatment.”  \nIn looking at outcomes for residents, our psychology consultant, who is also a nationally \nrecognized expert in psychopharmacology, concludes that many residents at BSDC are “grossly \nover-medicated.”  He concludes that psychotropic medication usage at BSDC is high and that the \npercentage of residents subjected to psychotropic polypharmacy is high.  With regard to \nindividual doses, he concludes that “[d]oses used are higher than any I have seen in many other \nfacilities across the country, as well as the one I worked at for ten years in the 1970s.” He added \nthat the effective doses of several medications are half those used at BSDC.  He also found that \nthe decision-making process for titrating drugs up or down after review of their effects on \nbehavior is often not clear in the records; the psychiatric consult reports in the medical records \nare very brief, containing minimal information; and the coordination of psychological and \npsychiatric evaluations is not clearly evident in the individual charts. \nOur consultant psychiatrist listed a host of concerns as well with regard to the delivery of \npsychiatric care to dually diagnosed BSDC residents, including: \n•\t Moderate-to-high doses of typical or “first-generation” anti-psychotic medications are \ntoo often used without sufficient clinical justification.  These residents face the potential \nharm of excessive exposure to the long-term risks of these medications, including tardive \ndyskinesia and Parkinsonism. \n•\t In too many cases at BSDC, there is general therapeutic inertia where teams are often \ncontent to maintain the status quo, sometimes even in the face of the possibility of \nmedication side effects or other negative consequences of psychotropics.  This includes \nfailure to reduce or discontinue medications in light of clinically significant intervals \nwith no symptoms, and failure to change treatment in spite of new and significant \nsymptoms.  Given outside opposition to some medication changes, the facility is not \ndoing enough to educate and address the concerns of parents and guardians when \nmedication changes are needed to provide the resident with acceptable psychiatric care. \n•\t There is some diagnostic-therapeutic disconnect, where the resident’s diagnosis does not \nobviously explain the psychotropic regimen in place.  When this happens, typically there \n\n- 24 -\nis insufficient explanation or justification in the individual records for the clinical \ndecision-making.  In these cases, the potential to harm the resident is two-fold – the \nperson may be treated with inappropriate and/or unnecessary medications and, at the \nsame time, will not be receiving proper treatment for his or her underlying mental illness. \n•\t For certain BSDC residents with anxiety and/or insomnia, there is chronic use of low-to-\nmoderately high doses of benzodiazepines, which does not reflect good practice in \npersons with intellectual disabilities because this class of medications diminishes \ncognition. Too often, benzodiazepine are used at excessive doses and/or for longer \nperiods of time than appeared justified by the individual’s psychiatric diagnosis.  Such \nuse places these individuals at risk for psychological dependence, tolerance, excessive \nside effects, and a loss of inhibition with regard to certain behaviors. \n•\t Some intra-class polypharmacy is used without sufficient clinical justification.  Exposing \npersons to intra-class psychotropic polypharmacy is generally considered to be poor \npractice. Risks include unnecessary and additional side effects and potential drug-to-\ndrug interactions that would not be present if only one agent was used. \n•\t BSDC needs better and close coordination among behavioral, psychiatric, and neurologic \ntreatments, as several mood stabilizing drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders are also \neffective in treating seizure disorders. Moreover, most current anticonvulsant \nmedications are psychoactive and can have behavioral side effects.  Without close \ncoordination, the potential for harm associated with drug-to-drug interactions may go \nunrecognized. BSDC sometimes draws an artificial distinction between whether a \nmedication is being used for seizure disorders, psychiatric disorders, or behavioral \nmanagement.  In some cases, an anticonvulsant used for seizure disorders is not discussed \nat all in psychiatric notes even though it is clearly psychotropic. \n•\t The long-term use of anticholinergic medications for the treatment of side effects should \nbe avoided. However, too often at BSDC, residents receive these medications for long \nperiods of time without discussion of either the ongoing need or attempts to reduce the \ndosage. This exposes residents to the needless exposure to the side effects of these \nmedications. \nBSDC utilizes the DISCUS9 for monitoring side effects.  The DISCUS is commonly used \namong mental health practitioners for this purpose.  However, our psychology consultant \nconcludes that certain questionable DISCUS scores at BSDC revealed that the staff is not using \nthe DISCUS properly, calling into question whether or not the staff are adequately trained.  In \nany event, more information from side effects and movement disorder monitoring should be \n9  DISCUS is the acronym, widely recognized among mental health professionals, for the \n“Dyskinesia Identification System: Condensed User Scale.” \n\n- 25 \n-\nincluded in psychiatric progress notes to document that the clinician is aware of and utilizing this \ninformation in decision-making.  If risks are not identified, harm to the resident could result. \nC.  HEALTH CARE AND RELATED SERVICES \nThe Supreme Court has determined that institutionalized persons with developmental \ndisabilities are entitled to adequate medical care.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. at 324. The \nCourt labeled this as one of the “essentials of care that the State must provide.”  Id.  The Court \nspecifically referenced persons with degrees or training in medicine, nursing, and physical \ntherapy as some of the health care professionals covered by its decision.  Id. at 323 n.30. \n1.  Medical and Nursing Care \nIn a number of respects, BSDC too often fails to provide residents with adequate health \ncare. The facility fails to develop and implement individualized plans for preventive care \nconsistent with generally accepted practice. Overall, the health care at BSDC is more reactive \nthan proactive, where the residents, especially those with complex and high-risk conditions, \noften do not receive adequate preventive health care; the facility does not do enough to identify, \nassess, treat, and monitor these high-risk residents.  \nIn general, the facility does not provide good interdisciplinary care. There is often \ninadequate collaboration and coordination between and among the various health care \ndisciplines, especially with regard to complicated resident cases.  Separate disciplines often fail \nto work together well, which leads to fragmented silos of health care activity that occur on \nlargely parallel tracks. The multiplicity of charts for the same individual hampers \ncommunication among professionals and staff and impedes coordination of efforts.  The charts \noften do not reflect adequately the health care decision-making process.  The charts also do not \nreveal clearly what is happening with residents.  Current and future plans for care are difficult to \ndiscern from the charts, placing residents at risk of harm because of poor communication and \nlack of coordination about their care and treatment.  \nAll this has great implications for residents at risk for, among other things, bowel \nimpactions and obstructions, pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia, skin breakdown, seizures, \nand fractures due to osteoporosis. \nBowel impactions and bowel obstructions are typically preventable conditions, that can \nlead to discomfort, perforations, and even death, if left unaddressed.  Generally accepted practice \ndictates that care givers must be vigilant and take extra steps to prevent impactions or \nobstructions, especially among persons with developmental disabilities who are non-ambulatory \nand face other contributing risk factors. This is a significant concern at BSDC, as the facility \nidentified over two dozen residents who are at “high risk” for impaction or bowel obstruction. \nThis list apparently does not include all those who are truly at risk though. For example, a \nhandful of residents visited or were admitted to a hospital for abdominal issues in the year before \nour visit, but were not even included on the facility list of those at “high risk.”  This includes \n\n- 26 \n-\nresident VQ (hospitalized in June 2006 for fecal retention with impaction) and resident UP \n(hospitalized in March 2007 for abdominal pain).  It is troubling that from June 1, 2006 to \nAugust 31, 2007, the facility listed over a dozen instances where residents had to be transferred \nto off-campus acute care facilities or emergency rooms to get treatment for impaction, \nobstruction, or abdominal pain, abdominal distension, or other related conditions.  Resident AR \n(age 37) died on September 12, 2007, after a year of serious abdominal issues, including hospital \nvisits or admissions for abdominal pain in December 2006, intense abdominal pain and a \nretracted ileostomy in March 2007, abdominal pain and distention in April 2007, and an ileus \ntreatment in May 2007. \nAspiration pneumonia is typically a preventable condition that results from the \naccumulation of foreign materials (usually food, liquid, or vomit) in the lungs.  BSDC lists only \nten residents as at “high risk” of aspiration or choking, yet several residents were hospitalized for \naspiration- or choking-related events who do not appear on the facility’s high risk list, including \nresident BS (hospitalized in September 2006 for possible aspiration pneumonia), resident CT \n(hospitalized that same month for an airway obstruction), resident DU (hospitalized in December \n2006 and January 2007 for vomiting blood and respiratory distress), resident EV (hospitalized in \nMarch 2007 for aspiration pneumonia), and resident FW (taken to the emergency room in \nAugust 2007 for upper air congestion). This calls into question whether or not BSDC is \nadequately identifying and treating all those residents at risk of aspirating or choking.  Resident \nZA died in January 2007, with aspiration pneumonia listed as her cause of death.  Several other \nresidents are listed as having died or been hospitalized, at least in part, due to pneumonia, \nalthough it is not clear if these pneumonia events were caused by aspiration. \nA decubitus ulcer or skin breakdown is another entirely preventable condition given \nappropriate proactive care. As with other conditions, BSDC is failing to identify all those \nresidents truly at risk and this hampers or eliminates the possibility of providing proper \npreventative services and supports. For example, in 2007, through October 16, the facility \nreported that nine different residents suffered a skin breakdown.  However, BSDC only listed a \ntotal of seven residents as at “high risk” for skin breakdown. Moreover, it is troubling that seven \nof the nine residents who actually suffered from skin breakdown did not appear on the facility’s \nhigh risk list. This speaks, in part, to poor communication and coordination between and among \nvarious health care disciplines. Although one health care professional might identify a resident \nas being at high risk for skin breakdown, this information may be buried in a progress note or a \nconsult form, and often does not reach other health care staff critical to the resident’s care. \nResident AD suffered numerous skin breakdowns in the year before our visit and there were \nnotations about this in his chart, but he was not on the facility’s list of residents at risk of skin \nbreakdown or on the list of those who had actually suffered skin breakdown. On October 12, \n2007, occupational therapy staff evaluated AD and found no problems.  Several hours later \nthough, a member of the nursing staff noticed that AD, in fact, was suffering from a stage-two \npressure ulcer. The nurse requested that the therapists return promptly to conduct a re-\nevaluation, but this was not done. Instead, three days after the nurse noted the ulcer and made \nthe request, a member of the therapy staff wrote the following note in the file:  “The seating \nsystem was evaluated by OT on 10/12/07.  The seating system continues to be adequate for [AD] \n\n- 27 \n-\nwith no pressure areas noted.” We found other residents who were not included on the risk list \neven though they had therapist notations that they were at high risk. These examples call into \nquestion whether or not BSDC is identifying and properly treating all those who are truly at risk. \nAt the time of our visit, BSDC listed 193 residents as having a seizure diagnosis of some \nsort. About 80 percent of these individuals are listed as having active seizures. There are 30 \nresidents who had two dozen or more seizure episodes during the period from June 1, 2006 to \nAugust 31, 2007. A number of residents appear to have complex cases characterized by very \nfrequent, poorly-controlled seizures. For example, during this period, resident FI had 210 \nseizures, resident GX had 100 seizures, resident XY had 128 seizures, resident RF had 106 \nseizures, and resident HY had 170 seizures. During this period, several residents had to be taken \nto area hospitals to treat seizures or to address a change in neurological status. Similar to the \narrangement with the consultant psychiatrist, the consultant neurologist visits BSDC to see \nresidents about two days per month.  This is not enough time to adequately meet the needs of the \ndozens of residents with often complex seizure disorders at BSDC.  \nIn the year before our visit, 15 BSDC residents died. While two residents had lived into \ntheir nineties, three residents died in their thirties – one from aspiration pneumonia, which is \ntypically a preventable condition. Indeed, pneumonia was listed as the cause of death for other \nBSDC residents. It was troubling to learn that the cause of death for at least two residents was \ncolon cancer; apparently, in these cases, the cancer had progressed and then spread to other parts \nof the body. These cancer victims were relatively young, aged 44 and 50.  It is unclear whether \nor not the facility took adequate preventive steps to detect the cancer at an early enough stage. \nIn a facility like BSDC, it is very important to identify whether or not each death was \npreventable. Given that persons with developmental disabilities may not be able to communicate \nsigns and symptoms well or at all, it may be more difficult for care givers to determine if the \ncourse of treatment selected is or was actually working.  Effective and in-depth mortality \nreviews can enhance this incomplete knowledge about the adequacy of care by identifying \nweaknesses and deficiencies in health care delivery. This can then prompt the development and \nimplementation of remedial measure that will eliminate preventable illness and death for other \nsimilarly situated residents.  Unfortunately, this is not done well presently at BSDC. The \nmortality review process at BSDC is inadequate.  Rather than conducting a critical and \nmeaningful review of the adequacy of the course of care in the weeks and months leading up to \neach death at the facility, the mortality review process at BSDC appears to be designed primarily \nto excuse from further scrutiny the BSDC health care provider(s) involved in the care of the \ndeceased resident. Indeed, our health care consultant looked at two dozen death reviews \nspanning nearly two years prior to our visit; none contained recommendations about what steps \ncould or should be developed and implemented to eradicate preventable causes in the future.  \nInfection control at BSDC is often deficient.  Although the facility reports the number \nand types of infections, it fails to follow its own procedures, which also require reporting on \nwhether an infection is caused by a caregiver. Such infections, which are always preventable, \nmay occur, for example, where a caregiver fails to wash his or her hands or use the proper sterile \n\n- 28 \n-\nprocedures. Unfortunately, hand-cleansing facilities are not consistently accessible on all the \nBSDC units. This is of great concern because proper hand cleansing is critical in the prevention \nof infectious illnesses and is particularly important in a facility like BSDC, which houses a \nnumber of medically fragile residents. \nFrom mid-2006 to mid-2007, BSDC averaged about 125 medication errors per quarter. \nWhile there were 158 medication errors in the fourth quarter of 2006, the number had declined to \n108 errors in the third quarter of 2007. Although the facility reports no deaths or permanent \nharm associated with any medication error, nonetheless, some of the medication errors are \nserious and place residents at risk of harm, sometimes necessitating increased monitoring, and in \na handful of cases, observation in a hospital setting. While the facility reports a very low error \nrate when measured as a percentage of total doses administered, nonetheless, on average, there is \nmore than one medication error every single day at BSDC. \nWhile the health care and other staff are dedicated, it is clear that staffing shortages have \ncompromised care and helped contribute to service delivery problems.  There are not enough \nregistered and other nurses at BSDC to meet the needs of the residents.  At times, there is \ninconsistent nursing coverage. Moreover, on-call staff and pulled staff at times contribute to \nmedication errors.  Staffing concerns also unnecessarily increase the workload of the nursing and \nother health care staff. \nThe BSDC professional health care staff has become unnecessarily isolated from \nprofessional organizations or societies related to providing health care and other services for \npersons with developmental disabilities.  Membership and active participation in such entities \nmay provide professional staff with access to up-to-date information and resources in this \nspecialized area and help them provide more effective health care to BSDC residents.  The \nfailures in this area may be a consequence of the overworked BSDC staff not having time to tend \nto professional development.    \n2.  Nutritional and Physical Management \nNutritional and physical management services are a significant aspect of adequate health \ncare services for persons with developmental disabilities.  These supports can minimize risks \nassociated with swallowing difficulties, digestion problems, misalignment, and skin breakdown, \nso as to avoid preventable hospitalizations associated with aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal \nproblems, and decubitus ulcers.  Unfortunately, residents do not receive adequate nutritional or \nphysical supports at BSDC. In this area especially, vulnerable at-risk residents need proactive \ncare to get ahead of problems that can lead to illness and hospitalization.  Current care at BSDC, \nhowever, is too reactionary; evaluations are conducted only when a problem arises.  \nAlthough BSDC has a dysphagia committee, the committee’s scope is too limited and \nnarrow; it does not proactively and comprehensively address the wide-ranging needs of the very \nvulnerable population. In fact, the committee does little more than merely address global issues, \nsuch as the need for thickening agents for liquids for residents who have difficulty swallowing. \n\n- 29 -\nThe committee fails to address the individualized needs and concerns of the highest risk \nresidents at BSDC. \nThe facility as a whole needs to better identify and address the needs of those residents \nwho are most at risk.  Simply having a limited dysphagia team is not enough.  More needs to be \ndone to minimize residents’ risk and maximize their skill acquisition.  Overall, there needs to be \nmore of a proactive, cooperative, collaborative, systemic team approach to addressing nutritional \nand physical support issues. Otherwise, the risk of aspiration pneumonia and other \ngastrointestinal problems and hospitalizations will remain unnecessarily high for certain BSDC \nresidents. Indeed, the lack of such adequate services and supports can be fatal, as it was for IZ, a \nresident who was fed by g-tube. Several months prior to her death, the dysphagia team re-\nevaluated IZ because she had been having several episodes of increased coughing associated \nwith oral feedings.  Instead of discontinuing all oral intake, the facility continued to provide IZ \nwith both g-tube and oral feedings. IZ died shortly thereafter, with the cause of death listed as \npneumonia bacteremia, a lung infection that turns into a blood infection.  In reviewing the course \nof IZ’s care, our consultant determined that there was a significant likelihood that aspiration \ncontributed to IZ’s death and that stopping oral intake may have removed a contributing factor to \nher death. This is potentially a larger issue, as at the time of our visit, there were about 71 BSDC \nresidents who use a feeding tube. \nIt is positive that the facility has implemented family-style dining for residents. \nNonetheless, the facility needs to do more to ensure that individual diets are maintained in the \ncontext of family-style meals, especially for those on low-sodium and/or low-calorie diets. \nAlmost every resident has or is supposed to have an evaluation by physical and \noccupational therapy staff. Most residents need services and supports from one or both \ndisciplines, with some needing more intensive care.  For example, there are 81 residents with a \n24-hour re-positioning program and there are 18 residents listed as at “high risk” of developing \ncontractures. Unfortunately, physical and occupational therapy services at BSDC are not \nadequate. As a result, residents face an increased risk of contractures and deformity, resulting in \na loss of independence and functional skills.  The implemented plans are rote, not functional, and \nrather meaningless.  To be meaningful, therapy needs to be generalized to all settings, and not \njust occur in a vacuum at the therapy clinic.  At BSDC, however, the therapy provided is too \noften not integrated back to the residents’ lives. For example, merely lifting a leg weight at the \nclinic may not easily translate to a resident’s increased function in a real-life setting outside the \nclinic. Moreover, too often, goals for residents are set at levels the person has already achieved \n– and written plans are essentially identical year after year.  In short, it appears that the mindset \nat BSDC is that maintenance is acceptable.  None of this helps the residents learn or acquire \nskills so that they can gain functional independence in their current setting and later, in the \ncommunity.  To the contrary, BSDC’s current system allows for regression, and may even play a \nrole in helping to prevent certain residents from being placed back in the community. \nIt is critical that facilities like BSDC design and implement plans that meet the individual \nneeds of each resident, instructing staff how to perform activities like positioning the resident in \n\n- 30 \n-\na wheelchair or applying braces or orthotics. Nonetheless, BSDC fails to implement any such \nplans. Although instructions for the use of assistive devices like wheelchairs and braces \ngenerally are located on the units, these are broad blanket directions, and do not take into \naccount residents’ particular needs. Further, the facility fails to monitor residents’ progress in a \ntimely manner, and instead, simply conducts re-evaluations in the normal course, and not always \nwhen changed circumstances dictate. \nOn the positive side, while at the facility, we observed an excellent hands-on training \nsession given by two of the therapists. We are unclear, however, as to whether this is \nrepresentative of all the therapy training offered, and whether the trainers go on-site to check on \nthe continued competence of the staff.     \nAssistive technology is also a critical component of providing adequate communication \nand other supports to persons with developmental disabilities.  There are about 117 residents \nwith some form of speech or communication program, 37 residents with a communication \ndevice, and 17 residents with adaptive equipment for hearing assistance (6 residents elect not to \nuse the devices). Unfortunately, BSDC’s approach to assistive technology is fragmented and not \nteam-oriented.  BSDC lacks sufficient coordination and collaboration between and among the \nvarious disciplines, especially with regard to the need for proper communication devices on \nwheelchairs. For example, communication goals and expected outcomes for communication \nshould be part of any assessment for assistive technology, such as seating or other mobility \ndevices. The therapists involved in the assessment and selection of assistive technology must \nwork closely together to meet each resident’s individualized needs.  At BSDC, however, \nindividual therapists conduct unilateral assessments for each aspect of the assistive technology, \nwith no documentary evidence in the charts or elsewhere that they collaborate with one another. \nAs a result, particular pieces of assistive equipment too often do not meet the comprehensive \nneeds of the resident for whom they are intended.  \nIn addition, the facility fails to provide sufficient assistive communication systems to all \nresidents who would benefit from such supports.  Although it is positive that the high-tech \nassistive communication devices we observed at the facility were all operational, the facility \ndoes not provide sufficient low-tech systems, which may benefit many other residents who \nrequire assistive technology supports for independent communication. \nFinally, as is true in other areas, staffing concerns exist within the disciplines that provide \nhealth care and nutritional and physical supports to BSDC residents.  Currently, BSDC does not \nhave enough clinicians to provide adequate physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech \ntherapy to meet the needs of residents who require these services.  For example, despite the fact \nthat communication is a basic need of all residents, the facility has only two speech therapists; a \nthird speech therapy position was frozen at the time of our visit.  Two speech therapists are not \nenough to meet the needs of BSDC residents.  \n\n- 31 \n-\nD.\t SERVING PERSONS IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING APPROPRIATE \nTO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS \nIn addition to providing residents with adequate safety, training and behavioral services, \nfreedom from undue restraints, psychiatric care, health care, and other related supports and \nservices, federal law requires that the State actively pursue the timely discharge of \ninstitutionalized residents to the most integrated, appropriate setting that is consistent with the \nresidents’ needs. \nIn construing the anti-discrimination provision contained within the public services \nportion (Title II) of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the Supreme Court held that \n“[u]njustified [institutional] isolation . . . is properly regarded as discrimination based on \ndisability.” Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597, 600 (1999). Specifically, the Court established \nthat states are required to provide community-based services and supports for persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities when the state’s treatment professionals have determined that \ncommunity placement is appropriate, provided that the transfer is not opposed by the affected \nindividual, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the \nresources available to the state and the needs of others with mental disabilities.  Id. at 602, 607. \nThe regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA provide:  “A public entity shall \nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (the integration \nregulation). The preamble to the regulations defines “the most integrated setting” to mean a \nsetting “that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the \nfullest extent possible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A at 450. \nFurther, with the New Freedom Initiative, President George W. Bush announced that it \nwas a high priority for his Administration to tear down barriers to equality and to expand \nopportunities available to Americans living with disabilities.  As one step in implementing the \nNew Freedom Initiative, on June 18, 2001, the President signed Executive Order No. 13217, \nentitled “Community-Based Alternatives for Individuals with Disabilities.”  Specifically, the \nPresident emphasized that unjustified isolation or segregation of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities in institutions is a form of prohibited discrimination, that the United States is \ncommitted to community-based alternatives for individuals with disabilities, and that the \nUnited States seeks to ensure that America’s community-based programs effectively foster \nindependence and participation in the community for Americans with disabilities.  Exec. Order \nNo. 13217, §§ 1(a)-(c), 66 Fed. Reg. 33155 (June 18, 2001). The President directed the Attorney \nGeneral to “fully enforce” Title II of the ADA, especially for the victims of unjustified \ninstitutionalization. Id. at § 2(c). \nWhere community transition does occur, the state is responsible for providing adequate \nfollow-along services.  See Armstead v. Coler, 914 F.2d 1464, 1467 (11th Cir. 1990); Thomas S. \nv. Brooks, 902 F.2d 250, 254-55 (4th Cir. 1990); Halderman v. Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp., \n834 F. Supp. 757, 766 (E.D. Pa. 1993). These follow-along services should include face-to-face \n\n- 32 \n-\nvisits with the transitioned resident; interviews with staff, family, and guardians; and careful \nreview of the transitioned resident’s records. Accordingly, the State should utilize measurable \ncriteria by which to ensure that transitions from BSDC are implemented as planned and that \nindividuals transitioned are safe and healthy in their new environments. \nAs set forth below, the State is failing to comply with the ADA with regard to placing \npersons now living in BSDC in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. \n1.  Community Placements from BSDC \nIn general, there appears to be a sensitivity within the State to the importance of serving \npersons with developmental disabilities in the most integrated community setting according to \ntheir individualized needs. We understand that the State’s position is that almost all BSDC \nresidents could be served in the community with adequate and appropriate protections, supports, \nand services. Indeed, the Nebraska Health and Human Services Department system manual \nemphasizes that the State strives to offer a community system of supports and services intended \nto allow individuals with developmental disabilities “to maximize their independence as they \nlive, work, recreate, and participate in their communities.”  It is notable that the State’s policy is \nthat all placements at the BSDC institution are considered to be temporary.  A separate State \npolicy provides that all individuals residing at BSDC are eligible for referral for placement from \nBSDC and for transition to a community provider.  Indeed, throughout our visit, BSDC staff \nacknowledged that persons with developmental disabilities generally can benefit from \ncommunity placement.  In spite of this, the State has not yet developed a written “Olmstead \nPlan,” which most states have developed to foster placement of persons with developmental \ndisabilities to more integrated community settings. \nAs of August 31, 2007, the State reported that 296 current BSDC residents – over 90 \npercent of the overall census – had an interdisciplinary team recommendation for community \nplacement.  The team recommendations are contained in individual BSDC Personal Plans. \nInvariably, the BSDC team determines that a referral for placement “should be continued.”  It is \npositive that there are written individual team determinations with regard to placement in the \nmost integrated setting. \nIn spite of all this, the number of residents discharged from BSDC to integrated \ncommunity placements has been very low and has stagnated over recent years.  As of mid-\nOctober, BSDC had placed only two residents into integrated community settings in 2007.  In \nthe previous five years, BSDC placed a total of only 14 residents into the community – an \naverage of less than three per year. Not a single resident was placed into the community in all of \ncalendar year 2005. In the last 10 years, BSDC has never placed more than six residents in any \ngiven year into integrated, non-institutional settings. As a result, it is clear that team \nrecommendations are not being implemented and that many BSDC residents who have been \nassessed as appropriate for community placement remain in the segregated institution.  \n\n- 33 -\nThe census at BSDC has slowly but steadily decreased in the past 10 years. In 1997, \nBSDC served 401 residents; as of mid-October 2007, BSDC served 322 persons.  However, the \nnumber of residents has decreased not because of increased community placements, but, \nespecially in recent years, almost exclusively due to resident deaths and facility transfers to other \nrestrictive settings such as nursing homes or other institutions.  Thus far in 2007, 11 residents \nhave died and 15 residents were transferred to other restrictive settings; this accounted for over \n95 percent of the changed census number from 2006.  A very similar situation existed the \nprevious year. There were 11 resident deaths and 10 discharges to other institutional settings; \nthis accounted for over 90 percent of the changed census number from 2005.  The emphasis on \ntransferring residents to other restrictive settings is a relatively new phenomenon.  For example, \nfrom 1997-2004, only three residents had been transferred to another restrictive setting; since \nthen, 31 residents have been referred to nursing homes or other institutions. \nThe small number of community placements is troublesome because not all BSDC \nresidents are difficult to place. While it may be true that some of those who live at BSDC may \nhave unique care considerations and face more barriers to placement than others, this does not \nmean that they cannot be placed with appropriate protections, services, and supports.10 \n2.  Barriers and Impediments to Community Placement \nIt appears that the opposition of certain parents and guardians is a significant barrier at \ntimes to effecting placement determinations.  As of March 2007, the facility estimated that about \n76 percent of BSDC guardians were not willing to consider community placement options.  We \nlearned that if a family member or guardian expresses opposition or lack of interest in \ncommunity placement, the resident’s Personal Plan invariably concludes that continued stay at \nBSDC is appropriate at this time, regardless of the team’s separate determination on the \nappropriateness of community placement.  This is true for a wide variety of BSDC residents, \nincluding those who enjoy community visits, are stable, are very capable, and have team goals to \nbe more independent.  \nIt appears that few meaningful activities are undertaken to help support placement efforts \nfrom BSDC as long as a parent or guardian is not in agreement.  This is unfortunate, especially \nin those cases where BSDC residents have expressed an eagerness to leave the facility to live in \nthe community, but cannot leave because of outside opposition.  The State has recognized that \nBSDC guardians sometimes make decisions that do not support a resident’s choices and goals, \nwhich often include community placement.  \n10 Shortly after our on-site visit, the State announced its intent to “right-size” the facility \nto serve fewer people at BSDC by determining if additional persons could be served in the \ncommunity.  There were no details as to how many residents might be impacted or when or \nwhere placements might occur.  \n\n- 34 \n-\nMuch of the opposition appears to be driven by unfounded fears or a lack of knowledge \nabout community alternatives that are or could be developed.  The State has not done enough to \nwork with parents and guardians to better educate them about community options so as to better \nensure that their decisions about placement are truly informed ones.  Indeed, BSDC staff \ninformed us that it was their belief that parents and guardians would be more open to community \nplacement if the State could provide them with more information and tangible assurances of \nsafety. The State has not done enough to create forums where family members and guardians \ncan ask questions, share information, and exchange transition success stories and how to \novercome placement challenges.  The State has not done enough to facilitate on-site visits to \nsuccessful community homes.  Moreover, the State has not done enough to alert families and \nguardians about new community provider home openings as they become available. \nAnother significant barrier is the lack and/or perceived lack of available community \nresources, including inadequate community provider expertise and capacity.  This is especially \nsignificant for persons with involved health care needs and/or mental health/behavioral concerns. \nFor example, the State does not appear to have developed viable integrated community \nalternatives to congregate nursing homes for persons with involved health care needs. \nMoreover, other than the few individuals impacted each year by the OTS program, which is \ndiscussed below, the State appears to provide inadequate expertise and support to placed \nindividuals and to their providers when behavioral and mental health concerns and crises \nemerge.  Especially in more rural parts of the State, there are relatively few psychiatrists with \nexpertise in treating persons with developmental disabilities; local doctors may not have the \nexperience to provide the psychiatric care needed for this often challenging population. \nThe community resources barrier appears to be having a tangible impact on whether \nappropriate BSDC residents must remain institutionalized indefinitely or whether they can move \ninto more integrated community settings.  Inadequate community resources, including \ninadequate community provider expertise and capacity, may slow transition efforts or render \ncommunity placement unrealistic in some cases.  Moreover, inadequate community resources, \nwhether real or perceived, may chill families, guardians, and even BSDC teams from pursuing \nneeded and worthwhile community alternatives for BSDC residents.  \nIt is not clear that the State has done enough to identify and eliminate inadequate \nresource and capacity issues to meet the needs of BSDC residents who are appropriate for \ncommunity placement.  It appears that State efforts are not proactive, exhaustive, or in-depth in \ncertain individual cases, especially when it is known that there is family or guardian opposition. \nFor example, right now, BSDC appears to do nothing more than make a routine overture to the \npertinent Regional Service Area11 to determine whether adequate community resources exist or \ncan be created to accommodate the resident in question.  However, community providers \n11  The State of Nebraska’s Health and Human Services System is administratively \ndivided into five regions or Service Areas:  Northern, Eastern (Omaha metropolitan area), \nSoutheast, Central, and Western. \n\n- 35 \n-\ntypically do not create community homes and community resources, or even respond to State \ncommunity service referral requests when the providers know that a parent or guardian is \nopposed to placement.  Often, BSDC teams proceed with annual meetings without having \nreceived clear guidance from the Service Area on community resources or capacity.  In this \nrather passive framework, it is unlikely that placement settings will be created for those BSDC \nresidents who need or want to live in the community. \nAs a result of all this, an unfortunate cycle has been created: community resources are \nnot developed because parents and guardians oppose and the parents and guardians oppose \nbecause sufficient community resources have not been developed.  The State has not done \nenough to break this cycle by creating sufficient incentives for community providers to respond \nto service referral requests and to develop homes and resources to meet the placement needs of \nBSDC residents. \nIn the handful of instances each year where a BSDC resident is to be transitioned to the \ncommunity, it appears that the transition and placement process is a considered and thoughtful \none. The State reports that, in a series of transition meetings, there is an attempt to tailor the \nsetting for the individual, address accessibility issues, and find a proper mix of clients for each \nhome.  The State reports that the transitioning individual makes a couple of pre-placement visits \nto the home to better ensure that it will be a good fit.  The State reports little post-placement \nrecidivism of discharged residents back to BSDC or to another institutional setting.  This is one \nmarker that the transitions have been successful, at least in the short-term.  The State appears to \nplace an appropriate emphasis on serving clients in smaller settings.  For example, in the \nSoutheast Service Area, over 95 percent of the clients with developmental disabilities live in \nhomes of five or fewer persons; the average number of persons in one setting is about two to \nthree per home.  \nThe individuals in these homes are supported by service coordinators who are to oversee \nthe care and services they receive in the community.  The richest average ratio is one service \ncoordinator for every 23 clients in the Western Service Area; the poorest average ratio is in the \nEastern Service Area at 1:30. There are no separate intensive service coordinator services with \neven richer ratios for persons with more involved and complex needs.  It may be that vast \ngeographical coverage areas, lack of community expertise and infrastructure, or other variables \nmay necessitate richer ratios in order to meet the needs of the clients placed in the community. \nThis is especially true for persons with behavioral issues and/or mental illness.  Our psychology \nconsultant noted that service coordinators are dispersed around the state and have limited time to \nadvocate for the placement of a particular BSDC resident in the community and to support his or \nher retention there. \nProblems with service-delivery and monitoring in the community appear to be having a \ndirect, negative impact on the health and welfare of a number of clients with developmental \ndisabilities who live in the Nebraska community system.  During our visit, for example, we \nlearned that a number of community clients have experienced significant problems associated \nwith their inadequately addressed behaviors and/or inadequately treated mental illness.  We \n\n- 36 \n-\nlearned that, in response to the rise or escalation of a new or ongoing behavior problem, too \noften clients are subjected to the administration of a large number of (often inappropriate) \npsychotropic or other medications.  There is an issue as to whether particular community \nprofessional and other staff have the expertise needed to adequately treat persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities who may have behavior problems or a dual diagnosis of mental \nillness. It seems clear that the State has not done enough to ensure that adequate behavioral \nsupports and psychiatric care are provided to clients in the community.  In particular, the State \nhas not done enough to provide technical assistance or expert guidance to community teams, \nguardians, or providers to ensure that a solid professional is providing adequate input or actual \ndirect professional services to placed individuals with problem behaviors or mental illness. \nAs referenced above, problems in the community like this have a negative impact on \ncurrent BSDC residents as well. If the State does not identify and resolve such community \nproblems, certain BSDC residents, who are entitled to adequate and integrated community \nplacements, will not have a viable alternative to ongoing, unduly restrictive care at the BSDC \ninstitution. For example, BSDC teams may not recommend or take meaningful steps toward \ncommunity placement if the teams suspect that needed protections, supports, and services are not \nin place in the community.  Parents and guardians, influenced by anecdotes of poor community \ncare, may not support or take affirmative steps to help implement team recommendations for \nplacement.  Finally, community providers may not accept certain BSDC residents with difficult \nbehaviors or mental illness simply because the State has not provided the providers with the \nneeded expertise, guidance, and support to meet the individualized needs of the person. \nThe State currently underutilizes expertise and resources at the various local and State \ncolleges and universities that maintain programs related to providing protections, supports, and \nservices to persons with developmental disabilities.  Our psychology consultant observed that, \nduring his on-site tour of BSDC, he met no students, which he found unusual.  He noted that \nacademic ties typically bring expertise, energy, as well as new and helpful research and practices \nto State programs and activities.  Strengthening ties to such university programs would enable \nthe State to tap into local expertise to help solve ongoing and outstanding problems, especially \nwith regard to serving and supporting clients in the community, offering integrated habilitation \nand other community activities, treating behavior problems, reducing the use of restraints, \nproviding psychiatric care and services, and providing proactive health care. \nThere does not appear to be any fiscal impediment to transferring BSDC residents to the \ncommunity.  On average, the cost to serve a person with developmental disabilities at BSDC is \nabout twice the cost in the community.  In fiscal year 2008, the annualized per diem cost to serve \na resident at BSDC is over $142,000.00; last year’s support costs for persons on the State’s \ncomprehensive waiver (receiving both day and residential services, including service \n\n- 37 \n-\n coordination, specialized services, room and board, and medical costs) was only about \n$71,000.00.12 \nIn spite of this, there is an ongoing concern that competition for limited community funds \nbetween BSDC residents and persons on the State’s waitlist could pose a barrier or a yearly limit \nto placements from BSDC.  As of September 21, 2007, Nebraska served a total of 3,499 persons \nwith developmental disabilities in community services.  In addition, there are 2,665 other \npersons with developmental disabilities on the State’s waitlist for community services:  1,319 \npersons who receive limited community services and service coordination, and 1,346 persons \nwho receive only service coordination. \n3.  Outreach and Intensive Treatment Services Program \nThe State has a small but worthwhile program at BSDC that helps keep persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities from being institutionalized long-term.  The State’s Outreach and \nIntensive Treatment Services program is headquartered at BSDC and consists of two branches: \nthe Outreach Treatment Services (“OTS”) program and the Intensive Treatment Services (“ITS”) \nprogram.  The OTS program provides intensive consultation services on-site in natural \ncommunity settings throughout the entire State of Nebraska for persons with developmental \ndisabilities who are experiencing behavioral difficulties such as physical aggression, property \ndestruction, and verbal aggression. About 80 percent of OTS-consulted individuals have had a \ndual diagnosis of mental retardation and mental illness.  Over the course of several days, the \nOTS professionals identify the function and the context of challenging behaviors and then \ndevelop tailored and individualized recommendations, with specific interaction guidelines, \nintervention methods, and environmental modifications, for community teams to implement. \nOTS then provides limited follow-up contact for a short time thereafter.  \nThe laudable goal at OTS is to support positive behavioral change to keep individuals as \nindependent as possible, and in familiar surroundings in their homes in the community – away \nfrom more restrictive placements such as hospitals, nursing homes, psychiatric facilities, and \nother institutions like BSDC. OTS reports a high degree of success with good outcomes.  OTS \nreports that the vast majority of local teams fully implement OTS behavioral and other \nrecommendations.  Most importantly, OTS reports that the individuals are typically able to \nmaintain their community placement and other services, thus avoiding institutionalization.  Such \nsuccesses are very positive. \nThe ITS program provides short-term, in-patient behavioral treatment services for \npersons with developmental disabilities on a small, eight-bed unit on the BSDC campus. \nInvariably, all eight beds are full at any given time.  The individuals served in the ITS often have \n12  The Federal Government, through the Medicaid Program, pays for over half (about 58 \npercent) of the costs of institutional care at BSDC, as well as the costs of community care \nthrough the Medicaid Waiver program.  \n\n- 38 \n-\nbeen involved in serious behavioral incidents including physical aggression, verbal aggression, \nproperty destruction, self-injurious behavior, refusal to perform essential tasks, and elopement. \nITS professionals try to stabilize individuals, identify the function and context of their \nchallenging behaviors, and then develop and implement tailored and individualized \nrecommendations to reduce these behaviors.  We learned that it is common for the ITS to have to \nreduce and/or eliminate the use of certain inappropriate psychotropic medications that had been \nprescribed in the community.  For example, in 2005, the ITS effected 144 psychotropic \nmedication changes; in 2003, the number was 266.  Typically, there are issues related to \npolypharmacy, dosage, and appropriateness of the medications.  Ultimately, the ITS seeks to \ntransport the person back to the community within about three to four months with a better \nindividualized support/behavior plan supported by a proper mix of psychotropic medications, if \nnecessary. The ITS assists with the transition so as to better ensure success in the community. \nThe ITS then provides limited follow-up contact for a short time thereafter.  \nWhile overall this is a worthwhile initiative, there is a lingering concern that too many \nindividuals do not return to the community after admission to the ITS, even though the State tries \nto avoid this. In 2005, 10 of 16 individuals discharged from the ITS were admitted to BSDC \nlong-term; from 1997-2004, almost one-third of ITS admissions ended up at BSDC or another \ninstitutional setting. The ITS reports that some of these individuals had engaged in what would \nbe considered criminal activity, and that this made them difficult to place.  This may also \naccount for the rather lengthy stays at the ITS; in 2005, the average length of stay was about six \nmonths, with one stay extending for 419 days.  This undercuts ITS’s role as a “short-term” \nprogram.    \nBoth the OTS and the ITS are creative programs that appear to be having a positive \nimpact on preventing certain individuals with developmental disabilities from being \ninstitutionalized long-term.  If anything, these programs should be strengthened and expanded so \nthat they reach more people.  Indeed, since 1997, the ITS has involved an average of only 14 \npersons per year; as of mid-October, the ITS was on a pace to serve only 10 persons in 2007. \nOTS personnel have averaged only about three dozen community visits per year since 2000, and \nthe number of client outcomes achieved has been rather modest – the OTS closed 44 cases in \n2006 and only 19 cases in 2005. Moreover, neither of these programs appears to be large \nenough now to meet current needs.  For example, as of October 15, 2007, there were 21 \nindividuals identified as waiting to get into the ITS; several persons have been waiting for over a \nyear. Many other persons could receive OTS services each year if the program had a larger \ncapacity. \nThe State does not make enough of a concerted effort to identify systemic issues from the \nindividual cases arising under the OTS and the ITS that may cause community placements to fail \nand place individuals at risk of institutionalization. The ad hoc approach adopted thus far to \naddress individual community problems has not led to the identification and development of \nsystemic solutions to prevent these problems from recurring for a much larger group of similarly \nsituated persons with developmental disabilities.  Such an approach could address outstanding \nconcerns associated with community health care, behavioral and mental health issues, individual \n\n- 39 \n-\ncrises, provider frustration and failures, and resource limitations especially with regard to service \ndelivery in rural areas. \n4.  Bridges \nAs referenced above, at any given time, about a dozen persons with developmental \ndisabilities live at the newly-created Bridges unit in Hastings, Nebraska. The Bridges facility is \na BSDC-affiliated program, but it receives no federal funds to operate.  This program treats \npersons with severe behavioral problems and/or a dual diagnosis of mental retardation and \nmental illness.  The Bridges is a more restrictive and confining facility, located on a rather \nisolated campus, and its residential unit is locked.  Each resident has his or her own room on this \nunit. The State informs us that it has taken more restrictive measures here because the \nindividuals served at Bridges typically have been involved in serious incidents, including alleged \nsexual assault, that led to the involvement of law enforcement.  Indeed, we understand that a few \nresidents at Bridges would be prosecuted if released from the program.  It was clear that most of \nthe residents of the Bridges facility likely would be in jail if not for this program. \nIn spite of this, facility staff have taken efforts to keep residents involved somewhat in \nthe community.  Staff informed us that each resident goes to the community about four times per \nmonth for an hour or two at a time.  Typically, the residents are provided with 2:1 staffing.  Staff \nacknowledged that lack of staff can sometimes pose a barrier to community visits.  Apparently, \nthe residents do well on the community trips and restraints are never needed.  We understand \nthat in the community, the residents are happier, less bored, and exhibit fewer problem \nbehaviors. Staff informed us that they continue to pursue community alternatives for the \nresidents, albeit with plans for heightened supervision and protections. \nIn order to help pave the way for possible placement, facility staff engage the residents \nthroughout each day in various programs, including individual therapy, coping strategy \nexercises, and social appropriateness programs.  Vocational activities occur on a separate floor \nfrom the residential unit in the same building.  There is a restraint room on the residential unit \nwhere residents are subjected, at times, to multi-point mechanical restraints during behavioral \nepisodes. Given limited time and the logistics of conducting a full team review so far from \nBeatrice, we did not engage in an in-depth analysis of the adequacy of these programs and \nwhether or not facility staff were adequately addressing the often very difficult problem \nbehaviors that led to the residents’ placement at Bridges.  Nonetheless, it appeared that the staff \nknew the residents very well and were working diligently toward helping the residents to meet \ntheir needs. \nIII.  MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \nTo remedy the identified deficiencies and protect the constitutional and statutory rights of \nBSDC residents, the State should implement promptly, at a minimum, the remedial measures set \nforth below: \n\n- 40 \n-\nA.\t Protection from Harm \n1.\t Procure adequate direct care staff and other staff hours to meet the needs of the residents. \n2.\t Ensure that residents are supervised adequately by trained staff and that residents are kept \nreasonably safe and protected from harm and risk of harm. \n3.\t Develop and implement adequate policies and procedures regarding timely and complete \nincident reporting and the conduct of investigations of serious incidents.  Train staff and \ninvestigators fully on how to implement these policies and procedures.  Centrally track \nand analyze trends of incidents and injuries, especially fractures, lacerations, and injuries \nof unknown origin, so as to develop and implement remedial measures that will prevent \nfuture events. Include systemic recommendations in investigation reports and ensure the \nprompt implementation of remedial measures to prevent future occurrence of incidents \nand injuries. \nB.\t Training, Habilitation, Behavioral Services, Restraints, and Psychiatric Services \n1.\t Provide residents with adequate training, including behavioral and habilitative services, \nneeded to meet the residents’ ongoing needs.  These services should be developed by \nqualified professionals consistent with accepted professional standards to reduce or \neliminate risks to personal safety, to reduce or eliminate unreasonable use of bodily \nrestraints, to prevent regression, and to facilitate the growth, development, and \nindependence of every resident. To this end, the facility should take the following steps: \n(A)\t Ensure that all residents receive meaningful habilitation daily.  Ensure that there \nis a comprehensive, interdisciplinary habilitative plan for each resident for the \nprovision of such training, services and supports, formulated by a qualified \ninterdisciplinary team that identifies individuals’ strengths, needs, preferences, \nand interests. Ensure that the plans address the residents’ needs, preferences, and \ninterests in an integrated fashion that utilizes the individuals’ existing strengths. \nEnsure that staff are trained in how to implement the written plans and that the \nplans are implemented properly. \n(B)\t Provide an assessment of all residents and develop and implement plans based on \nthese assessments to ensure that residents are receiving vocational and/or day \nprogramming services in the most integrated setting appropriate to meet their \nneeds. Ensure that there is sufficient staffing and transportation to enable \nresidents to work off campus or attend off-campus programming or activities \nwhen necessary. \n(C)\t Provide residents who have behavior problems with an adequate functional \nassessment so as to determine the appropriate treatments and interventions for \neach person. Ensure that this assessment is interdisciplinary and incorporates \n\n- 41 -\nmedical and other unaddressed conditions that may contribute to a resident’s \nbehavior. \n(D) \t Develop and implement comprehensive, individualized behavior programs for the \nresidents who need them.  Through competency-based training, train the \nappropriate staff how to implement the behavior programs and ensure that they \nare implemented consistently and effectively.  Record appropriate behavioral data \nand notes with regard to the resident’s progress on the programs. \n(E) \t Monitor adequately the residents’ progress on the programs and revise the \nprograms when necessary to ensure that residents’ behavioral needs are being \nmet.  Provide ongoing training for staff whenever a revision is required. \n2.\t Ensure that highly restrictive interventions or restraints are never used as punishment, in \nlieu of training programs, or for the convenience of staff.  To this end, the facility should \ntake the following steps: \n(A)\t Develop and implement a protocol that places appropriate limits on the use of all \nrestraints, especially the use of physical holds and one-point, two-point, three-\npoint, four-point, and five-point restraints, as well as the routine use of emergency \nchemical restraints.
