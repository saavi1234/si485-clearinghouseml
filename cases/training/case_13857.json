The court conducted the pretrial conference with counsel. There was no objection to entering the Pretrial Order. The parties will make brief opening statements and will present closing arguments in post-trial written submissions. The case will be tried under time limits, with 11 hours allocated to each side. The parties will attempt to narrow their objections to the exhibits so that exhibits to which there are no objections can be admitted at the beginning of the trial. To promote the efficiency of presenting the evidence, objections, including Daubert-type objections, can be made on the record during trial and addressed in the post-trial written submissions.

    "summary": "<p>On March 28, 2008, the Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP) - a Texas non-profit that helps integrate low-income black families into Dallas's predominately white suburban neighborhoods - filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA) under 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1982 and 1983, and the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3604 and 3605.</p>\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PH-TX-0004-0002.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its complaint</a>, ICP, represented by private counsel, sought injunctive relief, alleging that the TDHCA allocated federal tax credits to housing developers in a discriminatory manner, disproportionately granting credits for development in minority neighborhoods and disproportionately denying credits for development in white neighborhoods, thereby perpetuating racially segregated communities by creating a concentration of subsidized low-income housing in minority areas.</p>\r\n<p>ICP offered two theories of discrimination: disparate treatment under &sect; 1982 and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, and disparate impact under the FHA. Disparate treatment requires that the plaintiff show discriminatory intent, whereas disparate impact allows a plaintiff to establish illegal discrimination by showing that seemingly race-neutral policies disproportionately harm racial minorities without adequate justification.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2010, the District Court (Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater) denied the TDHCA's motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings, and granted ICP partial summary judgment. The court concluded that ICP had standing to bring the suit and had made a sufficient initial showing of both disparate treatment and disparate impact discrimination. <em>Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep't of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Affairs</em>, 749 F. Supp. 2d 486 (N.D. Tex. 2010).</p>\r\n<p>The case then proceeded to trial. On March 20, 2012, Judge Fitzwater held that ICP failed to establish that the TDHCA had acted with discriminatory intent and thus found for the TDHCA on the disparate treatment claims. However, the court ruled in favor of ICP on its disparate impact claim under the FHA and imposed an injunction on the TDHCA. <em>Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep't of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Affairs</em>, 860 F. Supp. 2d 312 (N.D. Tex. 2012).</p>\r\n<p>Following trial, the court began to craft the injunction. It considered proposals from the parties and ultimately adopted a remedial plan in August 2012, which stipulated changes to the TDHCA's tax credit allocation process and provided for monitoring by the court for at least five years. <em>Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep't of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Affairs</em>, 2012 WL 3201401 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 7, 2012), <em>amended in part</em>, 2012 WL 5458208 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 2012). In February 2013, the court awarded ICP attorneys' fees and costs totaling $1,893,969.</p>\r\n<p>The TDHCA appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on the issue of whether the District Court correctly found that ICP proved a violation of the FHA based on disparate impact. On March 24, 2014, the Fifth Circuit (Judge James E. Graves, Jr.) held that the District Court applied the wrong legal test for assessing disparate impact claims and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings under the correct test. <em>Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep't of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Affairs</em>, 747 F.3d 275 (5th Cir. 2014). The Fifth Circuit's reversal also nullified the remedial plan, and vacated and remanded the award of attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>Following the ruling from the Fifth Circuit, the TDHCA sought Supreme Court review, which the Supreme Court granted on October 2, 2014. The TDHCA had sought review on two questions: whether disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act, altogether, and if they are, the appropriate standards. The Court limited its review to the former issue. The district court stayed proceedings until the Supreme Court's resolution.</p>\r\n<p>On June 25, 2015, the Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit. In a majority decision by Justice Kennedy, the Court agreed that the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate impact liability, but emphasized that liability followed only if the challenged policy or practice actually caused a racial disparity, not merely accompanied one. The Court emphasized, as well, that remedies should not themselves promote unduly racialized decision making. Justice Alito wrote the principal dissent, joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas; Justice Thomas also wrote a separate dissent. The Court remanded the case for further proceedings in light of its opinion. 576 U.S. 519.</p>\r\n<p>On remand, the district court decided that the plaintiff&rsquo;s disparate impact claim should be decided on the current (or a supplemented) trial record. On August 26, 2016, Judge Fitzwater held that the plaintiff had not proved a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that a challenged practice caused a discriminatory effect and dismissed the disparate impact claim. The court applied a more onerous prima facie burden of proof than the one applied originally. 2016 WL 4494322.</p>\r\n<p>On October 4, 2016, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for a new trial. The case is now closed.</p>",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nDALLAS DIVISION\nTHE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES     §\nPROJECT, INC.,     §\n    §\nPlaintiff,     §\n    §  Civil Action No. 3:08-CV-0546-D\nVS.     §\n    §\nTHE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF       §\nHOUSING AND COMMUNITY     §\nAFFAIRS, et al.,     §\n    §\nDefendants.     §\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n           AND ORDER           \nFollowing the Fifth Circuit’s remand in this case, defendants Texas Department of\nHousing and Community Affairs and others (collectively, “TDHCA”) move to stay the\nproceedings pending the Supreme Court’s disposition of their petition for a writ of certiorari. \nPlaintiff The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (“ICP”) opposes the motion.  For the\nreasons that follow, the court grants the motion.\nI\nIn its merits decision in this case, the court held that ICP had failed to prove its\nintentional discrimination claims, but that it had proved that TDHCA’s allocation decisions\nhad a disparate racial impact, in violation of §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act\n(“FHA”).  See Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 860\nF.Supp.2d 312, 321, 331 (N.D. Tex. 2012) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (“ICP III”), rev’d, 747 F.3d 275\n(5th Cir. 2014), petition for cert. filed, 82 U.S.L.W. 3686 (U.S. May 13, 2014) (No.\n\n13-1371).  In ruling in ICP’s favor on its disparate impact claim, the court noted that the Fifth\nCircuit had not yet adopted a standard and proof regime for FHA-based disparate impact\nclaims, that the circuits that had done so had adopted at least three different standards and\nproof  regimes,  and  that  this  court’s  prior  summary  judgment  decision—Inclusive\nCommunities Project, Inc. v. Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, 749\nF.Supp.2d 486 (N.D. Tex. 2010) (Fitzwater, C.J.)—had essentially followed the approach\nof the Second Circuit in Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926,\n939 (2d Cir.), aff’d in part, 488 U.S. 15 (1988), but without engaging in a process of\nbalancing the factors identified in Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Village of\nArlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283 (7th Cir. 1977).  ICP III, 860 F.Supp.2d at 322 n.17.  The\ncourt also noted that it appeared at one point “that the Supreme Court might clarify this\nunsettled area of the law,” id., and that this court had deferred its decision in this case based\non a case pending before the Supreme Court. \nAfter this case was tried, and while the parties were making\npost-trial submissions, the Court granted certiorari in Gallagher\nv. Magner to decide two questions: “Are disparate impact claims\ncognizable under the Fair Housing Act?” and “If such claims are\ncognizable, should they be analyzed under the burden shifting\napproach used by three circuits, under the balancing test used by\nfour circuits, under a hybrid approach used by two circuits, or by\nsome other test?”  On February 14, 2012 this court entered an\norder  deferring  its  decision  in  this  case  until  Magner  was\ndecided.  But the Supreme Court dismissed the petition the same\nday this court entered its order. \nId. (citations omitted).  After the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, this court issued its\nruling in favor of ICP on its disparate impact claim.\n- 2 -\n\nOn appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded.  It held that this court had\n“correctly noted [that a] violation of the FHA can be shown either by proof of intentional\ndiscrimination or by proof of disparate impact.”  Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t\nof Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 747 F.3d 275, 280 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing cases).  But the panel\nalso noted that the Fifth Circuit had “not previously determined the legal standards that\nshould be applied in disparate impact housing discrimination cases,” id. at 280-81; that other\ncircuits “have applied multiple different legal standards to similar claims under the FHA,”\nid. at 281; and that “after [this] court’s decision in this case, [the U.S Department of Housing\nand Urban Development (“HUD”)] issued regulations regarding disparate impact claims\nunder the FHA,” id. at 282.  The panel then adopted the burden-shifting approach found in\nthe new HUD regulations for claims of disparate impact under the FHA, id. at 282, and it\nremanded the case to this court “to apply this legal standard to the facts in the first instance,”\nid. at 283.  In a footnote, the panel acknowledged, but rejected, TDHCA’s and intervenor’s\nreliance on the two recent cases in which the Supreme Court had granted writs of certiorari\nto determine whether disparate impacts claims are cognizable under the FHA—Township of\nMount Holly, N.J. v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct.\n2824 (2013) (granting petition for writ of certiorari), and Magner v. Gallagher, ___ U.S. ___,\n132 S.Ct. 548 (2011) (same)—but had dismissed the writs before hearing argument,\nTownship of Mount Holly, N.J. v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., ___ U.S. ___,\n134 S.Ct. 636 (2013) (dismissing writ), and Magner v. Gallagher, ___ U.S. ___, 132 S.Ct.\n1306 (2012) (same).  Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 747 F.3d at 280-81 n.4.\n- 3 -\n\nTDHCA has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari that presents two questions: “1. Are\ndisparate-impact claims cognizable under the Fair Housing Act? [and] 2. If disparate-impact\nclaims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act, what are the standards and burdens of\nproof that should apply?”  TDHCA Mot. Stay App. 2 (petition for a writ of certiorari).  \nII\n“The district court has a general discretionary power to stay proceedings before it in\nthe control of its docket and in the interests of justice.”  McKnight v. Blanchard, 667 F.2d\n477, 479 (5th Cir. 1982).  “[A] stay must be ‘so framed in its inception that its force will be\nspent within reasonable limits, so far at least as they are susceptible of prevision and\ndescription.’”  Wedgeworth v. Fibreboard Corp., 706 F.2d 541, 545 (5th Cir. 1983) (quoting\nLandis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 257 (1936)) (addressing stay entered in one case pending\nresolution of another case).\nThe court holds in its discretion that the proceedings on remand should be stayed\npending resolution of the Supreme Court’s decision on TDHCA’s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.  First, the Supreme Court has twice, and relatively recently, granted petitions that\npresented the question whether disparate impact claims are cognizable under the FHA.  If the\nCourt grants TDHCA’s petition and decides that such claims cannot be brought under the\nFHA, this court and the parties should not expend the resources necessary to litigate a claim\nthat is not legally viable.\nSecond, this court noted in its decision on the merits that “[t]he Fifth Circuit ha[d] not\nyet adopted a standard and proof regime for FHA-based disparate impact claims,” and that\n- 4 -\n\n“[t]he circuits that ha[d] done so ha[d] adopted at least three different standards and proof\nregimes.”  ICP III, 860 F.Supp.2d at 322 n.17.  Although the Fifth Circuit has now adopted\nthe HUD regulations for FHA disparate impact claims, TDHCA’s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari asks the Supreme Court to decide what standards and burdens of proof should\napply if such a claim is available under the FHA.\nThe idea that this case should be stayed while awaiting guidance from the Supreme\nCourt did not first arise when TDHCA filed the instant motion.  As noted, this court ordered\nthat its merits ruling be deferred while awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision in Magner v.\nGallagher, which was then scheduled for oral argument.  In a February 14, 2012 order the\ncourt wrote: “The court has concluded that it should defer its decision in this case until\nMagner is decided.  After the Supreme Court’s opinion is filed, this court will decide whether\nto establish a supplemental schedule for briefing in the present case.”  Feb. 14, 2012 Order\nat 1-2.  Although this court now has the benefit of an unequivocal, binding decision of the\nFifth Circuit confirming that a disparate impact claim is available under the FHA and\nadopting a specific proof regimen and standard, given the Supreme Court’s recent inclination\nto decide whether an FHA disparate impact claim is even available, and the possibility that\nit will decide in this case what are the standards and burdens of proof that apply—decisions\nthat will materially affect the proceedings in this case on remand—the court concludes in its\ndiscretion that this case should be stayed pending the outcome of TDHCA’s petition.\n- 5 -\n\nIII\nAccordingly, TDHCA’s May 16, 2014 motion to stay proceedings pending disposition\nof petition for certiorari is granted, and this case is stayed pending the Supreme Court’s\ndecision on TDHCA’s petition for a writ of certiorari.  If the petition is granted as to at least\none question presented, the stay will remain in place, and the court will direct that the case\nbe administratively closed for statistical purposes pending further order.  If the petition is\ndenied, the stay will be lifted automatically, and the court will proceed to adjudicate the case\nin accordance with the mandate and opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit in Inclusive Communities, 747 F.3d 275, after considering the parties’ views on\nsuch matters as the procedures and schedule that should be followed.\nSO ORDERED.\nJune 23, 2014.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

To further this goal,\nICP helps low-income African-American families eligible for the\nDallas Housing Authority’s Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program\n(“Section 8”) secure rental housing in predominantly Caucasian,\nsuburban areas of Dallas.  ICP provides its clients with move-\nrelated counseling and financial assistance, including payment of\napplication fees, deposits, and reasonable moving expenses, and may\nnegotiate with landlords on their behalf.\nTDHCA is the state entity responsible for administering the\nfederal Low Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) program in Texas.\nThe  LIHTC  program  is  designed  to  encourage  investment  in  low-\nincome, multifamily rental housing by providing a tax credit that\noffsets  an  investor’s  federal  income  taxes.    See  I.R.C.  §  42\n(discussing  “low-income  housing  credit”).    Developers  finance\nconstruction  of  a  project  by  selling  the  credits.    TDHCA\nadministers varying amounts of LIHTC funds each year——$43 million\nin  2007––and  has  the  authority  to  approve  or  deny  tax  credit\napplications  for  proposed  housing  developments.    In  evaluating\napplications, TDHCA follows an annual Qualified Allocation Plan\n(“QAP”) that prescribes complex requirements relating to threshold\neligibility and selection criteria.  See id. § 42(m) (requiring\nallocation of tax credits according to a “qualified allocation\n--  22  --\n\nplan”).     \nICP  avers  that  despite  the  QAP’s  requirements,  TDHCA  is\npermitted under Texas law to exercise discretion in making final\ndecisions regarding tax credit allocation and that TDHCA takes into\naccount race and ethnicity, both of the geographical area that\nsurrounds a proposed development and of its probable residents.\nICP  alleges  that  TDHCA  perpetuates  housing  segregation  by\ndisproportionately allocating tax credits for proposed developments\nin low-income, predominantly minority areas and denying tax credits\nfor proposed developments in higher-income, predominantly Caucasian\nareas.  ICP contends that this practice makes it more difficult for\nlow-income  minority  families  to  obtain  rental  housing  in\nneighborhoods not plagued with high crime, widespread poverty, and\nindustrial uses. \nICP avers that TDHCA’s consideration of race in allocating tax\ncredits  violates  two  provisions  of  the  FHA,  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment (actionable through 42 U.S.C. § 1983), and 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1982.  ICP seeks broad equitable relief, including an injunction\nthat prohibits TDHCA from using race or ethnicity as a factor in\nallocating  tax  credits;  an  injunction  that  requires  TDHCA  to\nallocate tax credits in a manner that creates as many LIHTC units\nin predominantly Caucasian areas as in minority-concentrated areas;\nand an injunction that prohibits TDHCA from allocating tax credits\nfor proposed developments in areas with undesirable conditions,\n--  33  --\n\nincluding high crime and industrial uses.  \nTDHCA moves under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) to dismiss ICP’s\nclaims for lack of standing based on failure to establish injury-\nin-fact.  TDHCA also moves under Rule 12(b)(7) to dismiss this suit\nfor failure to join as defendants the Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) and the City of Dallas (“City”).\nII\nBecause standing is a prerequisite to the exercise of federal\njurisdiction, the court considers this issue first and evaluates\neach of ICP’s claims in turn.  See Cole v. Gen. Motors Corp., 484\nF.3d 717, 721 (5th Cir. 2007).   \nA\nThe doctrine of standing addresses the question of who may\nproperly  bring  suit  in  federal  court.    It  “involves  both\nconstitutional  limitations  on  federal-court  jurisdiction  and\nprudential limitations on its exercise.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.\n490, 498 (1975).  To satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement of\nArticle III of the Constitution, the plaintiff must show that it\nhas  “suffered  ‘injury  in  fact,’  that  the  injury  is  ‘fairly\ntraceable’ to the actions of the defendant, and that the injury\nwill likely be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Bennett v.\nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)).  An injury in fact must be\n“concrete  and  .  .  .  actual  or  imminent,  not  conjectural  or\n--  44  --\n\nhypothetical.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted).2  Moreover, “the injury must affect the\nplaintiff in a personal and individual way.”  Id. at 560 n.1. \nIn its prudential dimension, standing encompasses “several\njudicially  self-imposed  limits  on  the  exercise  of  federal\njurisdiction.”  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984).  These\ninclude: \nwhether a plaintiff’s grievance arguably falls\nwithin the zone of interests protected by the\nstatutory  provision  invoked  in  the  suit,\nwhether  the  complaint  raises  abstract\nquestions  or  a  generalized  grievance  more\nproperly addressed by the legislative branch,\nand whether the plaintiff is asserting his or\nher own legal rights and interests rather than\nthe  legal  rights  and  interests  of  third\nparties. \n \nAss’n of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 363\n(5th Cir. 1999).  Congress may, however, “by legislation, expand\nstanding  to  the  full  extent  permitted  by  Art.  III,”  thus\nproscribing  the  judicial  cognizance  of  prudential  standing\nconsiderations.  Gladstone, Realtors v. Vill. of Bellwood, 441 U.S.\n91, 100 (1979); accord Bennett, 520 U.S. at 162.    \nAs the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, ICP bears\nthe  burden  of  proving  its  standing.    Lujan,  504  U.S.  at  561.\nBecause  TDHCA  filed  its  motion  to  dismiss  without  supporting\n2This tripartite test applies to all plaintiffs in federal\ncourt, whether individual or organizational.  Ass’n of Cmty. Orgs.\nfor Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 356 (5th Cir. 1999).  \n--  55  --\n\nevidence, its attack on the court’s jurisdiction is considered\nfacial, rather than factual, and the court must presume that the\nallegations of ICP’s complaint are true.  See Garcia v. Boyar &\nMiller, P.C., 2007 WL 2428572, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 28, 2007)\n(Fitzwater, J.) (citing Paterson v. Weinberger, 644 F.2d 521, 523\n(5th Cir. May 1981)).  Further, “[t]he court must deny the motion\nif the allegations are sufficient to allege jurisdiction.”  Id.  On\na  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of  standing,  “‘general  factual\nallegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may\nsuffice’” because the court presumes that “‘general allegations\nembrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the\nclaim.’”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n561)). \nB\nICP and TDHCA dispute whether ICP has sufficiently alleged\ninjury in fact.3  ICP pleads injury in that TDHCA’s allocation of\ntax credits increases the time and money that ICP must spend to\nhelp its clients secure affordable, integrated housing.  According\nto ICP, the landlords of LIHTC projects, unlike other landlords,\ncannot refuse to rent to Section 8 participants.  Because TDHCA’s\n3ICP asserts standing only on the basis of its own alleged\ninjury.  It does not allege that it has associational standing to\nsue on behalf of its clients in the absence of injury to itself.\nTherefore, the court does not consider this question.  See, e.g.,\nTex. Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 587-88 (5th Cir.\n2006) (discussing requirements for associational standing).   \n--  66  --\n\ntax credit allocation has allegedly resulted in fewer LIHTC units\nin predominantly Caucasian areas, ICP asserts that its staff must\nspend more time locating housing in these areas for its Section 8\nclients.  Further, it must provide them with greater financial\nassistance due to higher rents and must sometimes make “landlord\nincentive bonus payments” to landlords who agree to accept Section\n8 tenants.  P. Compl. ¶ 30. \n  TDHCA counters that ICP does not allege any cognizable injury.\nIt  posits  that  ICP’s  alleged  injury  is  merely  an  indirect\nconsequence of putative injury to its clients.  TDHCA maintains\nthat such indirect injury is insufficient to support standing.   \nC\nThe court first evaluates ICP’s standing under the FHA.  ICP\nalleges that TDHCA’s tax credit allocation violates the FHA because\nit makes both dwellings and financial assistance for constructing\ndwellings unavailable because of race.  See 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)\n(making it unlawful to “make unavailable” a dwelling to “any person\nbecause  of  race”);  id.  §  3605(a)  (making  it  unlawful  to\n“discriminate against any person in making available [a residential\nreal estate-related] transaction” because of race). \nThe FHA affords a cause of action to an “aggrieved person,”\nid.  §  3613(a)(1)(A),  and  defines  this  term  as  any  person  who\n“claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice”\nor  who  “believes  that  such  person  will  be  injured  by  a\n--  77  --\n\ndiscriminatory  housing  practice  that  is  about  to  occur,”  id.\n§  3602(i).    Through  these  provisions,  Congress  has  abrogated\nprudential standing under the FHA, thus extending standing to the\nlimits of Article III.  See Lincoln v. Case, 340 F.3d 283, 289 (5th\nCir. 2003) (“The Supreme Court has held that the sole requirement\nfor standing under the FHA is the Article III minima.”) (citing\nHavens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 372 (1982)).  On its\nFHA claims, therefore, ICP will have standing if it can establish\ninjury in fact, causation, and redressability——without regard to\nany prudential limitations.\n1\nHavens  Realty  involved  a  claim  of  injury  similar  to  that\npresented  in  the  instant  case.    A  fair  housing  organization,\nHousing  Opportunities  Made  Equal  (“HOME”),  contended  that  the\ndefendant realty corporation had engaged in racial steering, a\npractice  of  guiding  racial  and  ethnic  groups  to  neighborhoods\noccupied predominantly by those same groups.  Havens Realty, 455\nU.S. at 366-67.  HOME alleged that this practice frustrated “its\nefforts to assist equal access in housing through counseling and\nother referral services” and required it to “devote significant\nresources  to  identify  and  counteract  the  defendant’s  racially\ndiscriminatory steering practices.”  Id. at 379.  The Supreme Court\nheld that these allegations were sufficient to establish standing.\nId.  It reasoned:\n--  88  --\n\nIf, as broadly alleged, petitioners’ steering\npractices  have  perceptibly  impaired  HOME’s\nability  to  provide  counseling  and  referral\nservices  for  low-  and  moderate-income\nhomeseekers, there can be no question that the\norganization  has  suffered  injury  in  fact.\nSuch concrete and demonstrable injury to the\norganization’s activities——with the consequent\ndrain  on  the  organization’s\nresources——constitutes far more than simply a\nsetback to the organization’s abstract social\ninterests, see Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S.\n[727], 739 [(1972) (holding that environmental\norganization  could  not  establish  standing\nbased  only  on  a  mere  “bona  fide  special\ninterest” in the subject matter of the suit)].\nId.; see also Fair Housing of Marin v. Combs, 285 F.3d 899, 904-05\n(9th  Cir.  2002)  (holding  that  fair  housing  organization  had\nstanding under FHA based on frustration of mission and diversion of\nresources, and collecting similar cases).    \nThe gravamen of the allegations in Havens Realty and of those\nin  the  instant  case  are  analogous.    Like  the  Havens  Realty\norganization, ICP alleges that the challenged unlawful conduct has\na segregative effect that frustrates its mission of promoting equal\nhousing opportunities and requires it to spend more time and money\nin performing its activities than it otherwise would.  These are\nmore concrete allegations than a mere intangible setback to ICP’s\ngeneral interest in desegregation.  Moreover, going a step beyond\nthe Havens Realty organization, ICP pleads specific facts that\nsupport its claim of a drain on resources: that higher rents and\nreluctant landlords make it more difficult to place its Section 8\n--  99  --\n\nclients  in  non-LIHTC  housing.4    Therefore,  ICP  has  established\ninjury at the pleadings stage.5 \nThis conclusion is not altered by TDHCA’s contention that\nICP’s alleged injury is insufficient to establish standing because\nit is indirect.  It is true that the injury is indirect in that\nTDHCA’s alleged discrimination is directed not against ICP but\nagainst African-Americans, such as ICP’s clients.  Stated another\nway, the right to be free from discrimination based on race belongs\nto ICP’s clients rather than to ICP.  But the indirectness of ICP’s\ninjury  does  not  render  it  irrelevant  under  the  FHA.    Rather,\n4The  Fifth  Circuit  has  held  that  an  organization  may  not\n“bootstrap standing” by claiming a drain on its resources as a\nresult of costs incurred for the particular lawsuit in which it\nclaims standing.  See Ass’n for Retarded Citizens of Dallas v.\nDallas County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Ctr. Bd. of\nTrustees, 19 F.3d 241, 244 (5th Cir. 1994).  ICP does not allege\nstanding based on the costs of the instant lawsuit, and in its\nbrief it specifically disclaims reliance on them.    \n5At a later stage of this litigation, of course, ICP must\nadduce evidence that shows a drain on its resources resulting from\nTDHCA’s  tax  credit  allocation.    See  Fowler,  178  F.3d  at  360\n(holding that organization failed to establish standing where there\nwas no summary judgment evidence of any “concrete or identifiable\nresources  that  [it]  could  reallocate  to  other  uses”  if  the\ndefendant ceased its putatively unlawful conduct); La. ACORN Fair\nHousing v. LeBlanc, 211 F.3d 298, 305 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that\norganization  failed  to  establish  standing  where  there  was  no\nevidence  at  trial  that  it  was  required  to  put  any  “specific\nprojects”  on  hold  or  “re-double  efforts”  in  response  to  the\ndefendant’s conduct); cf. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (“[E]ach element\n[of standing] must be supported in the same way as any other matter\non which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the\nmanner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of\nthe litigation.”).  \n--  1100  --\n\nbecause under that statute Congress has abrogated the prudential\nstanding rules, ICP “may have standing to seek relief on the basis\nof the legal rights and interests of others”——so-called “third\nparty standing.”  Warth, 422 U.S. at 501; see also Gladstone,\nRealtors, 441 U.S. at 103 n.9 (interpreting the FHA) (“[A]s long as\nthe plaintiff suffers actual injury as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct, he is permitted to prove that the rights of another were\ninfringed.”);  Havens  Realty,  455  U.S.  at  375-78  (holding  that\nindividual  plaintiffs  had  standing  under  FHA  based  on  alleged\n“indirect” injury of being deprived of living in an integrated\ncommunity due to defendant’s racial steering of other persons), id.\nat 375 (“The distinction [between “third-party” and “first-party”\nstanding] is of little significance” under the FHA.).6  \n2\nTo  satisfy  the  causation  element  of  standing,  ICP  must\nestablish that its putative injury is fairly traceable to TDHCA’s\nallocation of tax credits.  The injury must not be the result of\n6TDHCA cites two cases to argue that ICP’s indirect injury\ndoes not support standing.  Both cases, however, are factually\ndistinguishable.  See Audler v. CBC Innovis, Inc., 519 F.3d 239,\n347-48  (5th  Cir.  2008)  (discussing  the  standing  of  a  class\nrepresentative  under  the  “juridical  link”  doctrine);  Garzes  v.\nLopez, 281 Fed. Appx. 323, 325-26 (5th Cir. June 9, 2008) (per\ncuriam) (applying rule that constituent of corporation does not\nhave standing based on economic harm that is merely a consequence\nof injury to corporation).  Moreover, although these cases state\nthe general rule that a litigant must assert his own rights rather\nthan the rights of others, this rule has been abrogated under the\nFHA and, as will be discussed below, does not bar ICP’s claims\nunder §§ 1982 and 1983.\n--  1111  --\n\nthe independent action of some third party not before the court.\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  ICP alleges that TDHCA’s disproportionate\ndenial of tax credit applications for proposed developments in\npredominantly Caucasian areas causes a relative scarcity of LIHTC\nunits there that makes it more difficult and expensive for ICP to\nsecure integrative housing for its clients.  ICP cites numerous\nstatistics  related  to  the  location  and  occupancy  of  LIHTC\ndevelopments  that  purportedly  demonstrate  that  they  are\ndisproportionately  located  in  census  tracts  with  above-average\nminority populations.  See, e.g., P. Compl. ¶ 16 (“While 19% of all\nrenter  occupied  units  in  the  City  of  Dallas  are  located  in\npredominantly [Caucasian] 70% to 100% [Caucasian] census tracts,\nonly 2.9% of TDHCA’s [LIHTC] units in the City are in those 70% to\n100%  [Caucasian]  census  tracts.”).    ICP  also  alleges  that  a\ncommittee of the Texas House of Representatives found that TDHCA’s\ntax credit allocation compounded housing segregation. \nAssumed  true,  ICP’s  allegations  permit  the  reasonable\ninference that, absent TDHCA’s consideration of race in tax credit\nallocation, there is a substantial probability that more LIHTC\nunits would be available in predominantly Caucasian areas.  This,\nin turn, would make it easier for ICP to secure housing for its\nclients in these areas.  Cf. Warth, 422 U.S. at 504 (involving\nchallenge to zoning regulations that allegedly excluded persons of\nlow or moderate income) (“Petitioners must allege facts from which\n--  1122  --\n\nit  reasonably  could  be  inferred  that,  absent  the  respondents’\nrestrictive zoning practices, there is a substantial probability\nthat  they  would  have  been  able  to  purchase  or  lease  in  [the\ncity].”).  Because no facts alleged suggest the existence of any\nindependent,  race-neutral  reasons  why  TDHCA  would\ndisproportionately  deny  tax  credit  applications  for  proposed\ndevelopments in Caucasian neighborhoods, it is fair and not merely\nspeculative to trace this imbalance to the alleged consideration of\nrace.  Cf. Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 42-43\n(1976)  (challenge  to  IRS  regulations  that  allegedly  encouraged\nhospitals to deny services to indigents) (“It is purely speculative\nwhether the denials of service specified in the complaint fairly\ncan be traced to petitioners’ ‘encouragement’ or instead result\nfrom decisions made by the hospitals without regard to the tax\nimplications.”).  Further, although granting tax credits for a\nproposed development may not guarantee that it ultimately will be\nconstructed, the court reasonably may infer that an increase in tax\ncredits  allocated  for  proposed  developments  in  predominantly\nCaucasian areas would over time increase the number of LIHTC units\navailable in these areas.  Therefore, the court holds that ICP\nsufficiently alleged the causation element of standing.\n--  1133  --\n\n3\nFinally, ICP must establish that it is likely, as opposed to\nmerely  speculative,  that  its  injury  will  be  redressed  by  a\nfavorable decision.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  Clearly, the\nbroad relief that ICP requests, e.g., an injunction that requires\nTDHCA to allocate tax credits so as to create as many LIHTC units\nin areas predominantly Caucasian as there are in areas that are\npredominantly minority, would redress the injury.  As suggested in\nthe  foregoing  causation  analysis,  however,  even  more  moderate\nrelief——enjoining TDHCA from considering race——would likely lead to\nmore LIHTC units in predominantly Caucasian areas.  Therefore, ICP\nhas established the redressability element of standing. \nD\nHaving determined that ICP has standing under the FHA, the\ncourt now turns to ICP’s claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983.\nICP maintains that TDHCA’s consideration of race violates § 1982 by\ndenying  non-Caucasian  citizens  an  equal  right  to  lease  real\nproperty  and  violates  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.\nConstitution by denying non-Caucasian citizens the equal protection\nof the laws.  See § 1982 (declaring that all citizens of the United\nStates “shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white\ncitizens” to lease real property, inter alia); § 1983 (providing\ncause of action for violation of constitutional and other federal\nrights).\n--  1144  --\n\nThe foregoing analysis of constitutional standing also applies\nto ICP’s §§ 1982 and 1983 claims: ICP has sufficiently alleged\nincreased resource costs that are both fairly traceable to TDHCA’s\nalleged  discriminatory  tax  credit  allocation  and  judicially\nredressable.    The  critical  question,  however,  is  whether  the\nprudential  rule  against  asserting  the  rights  of\nothers——inapplicable under the FHA——bars ICP’s standing under these\nstatutes.  See Fowler, 178 F.3d at 363; Singleton v. Wulff, 428\nU.S. 106, 114 (1976) (“‘Ordinarily, one may not claim standing in\nthis Court to vindicate the constitutional rights of some third\nparty.’” (quoting Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 255 (1953))).\nICP’s §§ 1982 and 1983 claims implicate its African-American\nclients’  right  to  be  free  of  race  discrimination  in  housing\nopportunities.  The limitation on “third-party standing” is not a\nconstitutional mandate, however, but is merely a “salutary rule of\nself-restraint.”    Craig  v.  Boren,  429  U.S.  190,  193  (1976)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  As such, courts have carved\nout exceptions to the rule where its justifications lack force.\nSee Singleton, 428 U.S. at 114 (“Like any general rule, however,\n[the rule against third-party standing] should not be applied where\nits underlying justifications are absent.”); Deerfield Med. Ctr. v.\nCity of Deerfield Beach, 661 F.2d 328, 333 (Former 5th Cir. 1981)\n(“In cases where these justifications are inapplicable, the general\nrule  should  be  excepted,  and  assertion  of  third  party  rights\n--  1155  --\n\npermitted.”); see generally Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction\n§ 2.3.4 (4th ed. 2003).  Consideration of these justifications\nleads the court to conclude that prudential standing does not bar\nICP from asserting its clients’ rights under §§ 1982 and 1983.   \n1\nThe Supreme Court in Singleton discussed the two principles\nthat animate the rule against third-party standing.  See Singleton,\n428  U.S.  at  113-16.    First,  the  rule  prevents  courts  from\nunnecessary or undesired adjudication of rights.  Two “factual\nelements” help resolve this question in a particular case: the\nrelationship between the litigant and the third party and the third\nparty’s ability to assert his own right.  Id. at 114-16.  If the\nlitigant and the third party have a close relationship and the\nlitigant is a part of the third party’s exercise of the right, then\nthe court’s “construction of the right is not unnecessary in the\nsense that the right’s enjoyment will be unaffected by the outcome\nof the suit.”  Id. at 114-15.  Moreover, if a genuine obstacle\nprevents the third party from asserting the right, then his absence\nfrom court “loses its tendency to suggest that his right is not\ntruly at stake, or truly important to him.”  Id. at 116.  \nSecond, the rule against third-party standing tends to ensure\nthat the most effective advocate for the right is before the court,\nwhich relies on the vigorous argument of litigants.  Generally,\n“third parties themselves . . . will be the best proponents of\n--  1166  --\n\ntheir own rights.”  Id. at 114.  This will not always be the case,\nhowever.  Rather, “the relationship between the litigant and the\nthird party may be such that the former is fully, or very nearly,\nas effective a proponent of the right as the latter.”  Id. at 115.\n2\nIn the instant case, precluding ICP from asserting under §§\n1982 and 1983 its African-American clients’ rights would not serve\nthe purposes of the prudential rule against third-party standing.\nTaken as true, ICP’s allegations indicate that it has a close,\nessentially representative relationship with its clients.  It acts\nlike their agent in locating integrated rental housing, and, at\ntimes, negotiating housing terms.  ICP is therefore an integral\npart  of  its  clients’  exercise  of  their  equal  housing-related\nrights.  For this reason, the outcome of ICP’s suit will not leave\nunaffected  its  clients’  enjoyment  of  their  rights.    Rather,  a\ndecision in ICP’s favor would increase its clients’ ability to\naccess equal housing opportunities.  Further, although ICP, rather\nthan  a  client,  is  the  litigant  before  the  court,  the\nrepresentative, advocacy-based relationship between them makes this\nlogical and obviates any implication that ICP’s clients do not wish\nto assert their rights.  Therefore, the court’s consideration of\nICP’s  §§  1982  and  1983  claims  will  not  be  an  unnecessary  or\nundesired adjudication of rights. \nMoreover, ICP’s relationship with its clients as well as its\n--  1177  --\n\nown organizational purpose suggest that it would be as effective as\nits  clients  in  advocating  their  rights.    ICP’s  mission  is  to\nachieve  housing  desegregation,  eliminating  the  obstacles  that\nconfront African-Americans and other minorities in their pursuit of\nequal housing opportunities.  The instant lawsuit is completely\nconsistent  with  this  mission  and  with  ICP’s  advocacy-based\nrelationship with its clients.  Under these circumstances, ICP can\nbe expected to be a vigorous proponent of its clients’ rights.  Cf.\nHudson Valley Freedom Theater, Inc. v. Heimbach, 671 F.2d 702, 706\n(2d Cir. 1982) (holding that not-for-profit theatrical corporation\norganized to reflect cultural interests of African-American and\nHispanic communities had standing under § 1983, inter alia, as the\nmost  effective  party  to  challenge  denial  of  grant  funds  as\ndiscrimination based on race of its patrons) (“When a corporation\nmeets  the  constitutional  test  of  standing  .  .  .  prudential\nconsiderations should not prohibit its asserting that defendants,\non racial grounds, are frustrating specific acts of the sort which\nthe corporation was founded to accomplish.”); City of Evanston v.\nBaird & Wagner, Inc., 1990 WL 186575, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 15,\n1990)  (holding  that  fair  housing  organization  established\nconstitutional and prudential standing under § 1982 to challenge\nracial steering practices).  But see Saunders v. Gen. Servs. Corp.,\n659 F. Supp. 1042, 1054 (E.D. Va. 1986).\n--  1188  --\n\nIII\nThe court now turns to TDHCA’s motion to dismiss for failure\nto comply with Rule 19.  \nA\nRule 19 seeks to ensure that lawsuits are disposed of fairly\nand completely.  Pulitzer-Polster v. Pulitzer, 784 F.2d 1305, 1308\n(5th Cir. 1986) (citing Rule 19 Advisory Committee’s note).  To\nthis end, it establishes a two-part process to identify persons who\nare needed for just adjudication of the action.  First, it provides\nthat certain persons are required to be joined as parties, if\nfeasible.  These include persons who are subject to service of\nprocess and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject\nmatter jurisdiction if “in that person’s absence, the court cannot\nafford complete relief among existing parties.”  Rule 19(a)(1).\nThis  is  a  “highly  practical,  fact-based  decision.”    Pulitzer-\nPolster, 784 F.2d at 1309.  Second, if joinder is not feasible, the\ncourt  must  decide  whether  that  person  is  indispensable.\nSpecifically, considering certain non-exhaustive factors, the court\n“must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action\nshould proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.”\nRule 19(b). \nB\nICP and TDHCA dispute whether the IRS and the City are parties\nrequired to be joined, if feasible, under Rule 19(a) in order for\n--  1199  --\n\nthe court to provide complete relief to ICP, and whether failure to\njoin them warrants dismissal.  As to the IRS, TDHCA posits that the\nTax  Code  provides  certain  incentives  for  developers  of  LIHTC\nhousing to select low-cost land, which is primarily located in\nminority neighborhoods.  TDHCA maintains that because developers\nselect the land before submitting tax credit applications, it has\nno control over their decisions to build in predominantly minority\nareas.  Therefore, TDHCA contends that the court cannot afford\ncomplete  relief  without  amending  the  Tax  Code  to  remove  these\nincentives, requiring the joinder of the IRS.  \nICP counters that joinder of the IRS is not necessary for\ncomplete relief.  ICP argues that its claims are aimed at TDHCA’s\ndisproportionate approval of tax credits for proposed developments\nin  minority  neighborhoods  compared  to  those  in  Caucasian\nneighborhoods, that this imbalanced approval rate can be remedied\nwithout any change to the Tax Code, and that recent amendments to\nthe Tax Code have diminished certain incentives that TDHCA cites.\nTDHCA also maintains that the City must be joined if the court\nis to afford complete relief.  It posits that it cannot provide\nfinal approval for a tax credit application unless the developer\nobtains  a  resolution  from  the  City  approving  the  project  and\nreceives  permission  from  the  zoning  authority  to  build  in  the\ndesired area, and that the Dallas City Council recently enforced a\nmoratorium on new LIHTC developments.  \n--  2200  --\n\nICP disputes this contention.  It points out that the Dallas\nCity  Council  is  no  longer  enforcing  the  moratorium,  and  it\nmaintains  that  there  is  adequate  zoned  land  in  Caucasian\nneighborhoods  on  which  to  build  LIHTC  units,  arguing  that  the\ndistribution  of  all  rental  units  throughout  Dallas  is  less\nsegregated than that of LIHTC units.    \nC \nThe court holds that ICP’s claims should not be dismissed for\nfailure to join the IRS or the City because neither is a party\nrequired to be joined if feasible under Rule 19(a) for the court to\nafford complete relief.  The gravamen of ICP’s complaint is that\nTDHCA is unlawfully discriminating based on race in tax credit\nallocation——not  merely  that  there  are  fewer  LIHTC  units  in\nCaucasian neighborhoods.  Assuming that ICP proves its claims, the\ncourt will be able to afford meaningful relief——enjoining TDHCA\nfrom considering race——without the presence of either the IRS or\nthe City.  See Rule 19 Advisory Committee’s note (explaining that\n“complete relief” is relief that is not “partial” or “hollow”).\nThe  court  is  not  persuaded  that  an  injunction  against  the\nconsideration  of  race  would  be  rendered  meaningless  or  hollow\neither by tax incentives favoring land in minority neighborhoods or\nby  the  City’s  consistently  blocking  the  construction  of  LIHTC\nhousing in Caucasian neighborhoods.  TDHCA does not dispute that,\ndespite  contrary  tax  incentives,  there  have  been  some  LIHTC\n--  2211  --\n\ndevelopments constructed in predominantly Caucasian areas, and it\npresents no evidence to suggest that the City will employ either\nits approval or zoning power so as to consistently exclude LIHTC\nhousing from these areas.7  \nBecause the court concludes that it will be able to afford\ncomplete relief in the absence of the IRS and the City, it does not\nreach the Rule 19(b) inquiry.  Even assuming, however, that the IRS\nand the City are parties required to be joined if feasible, TDHCA\nhas submitted no argument or evidence on whether they can be joined\nor, if not, on the equitable Rule 19(b) factors the court should\nconsider  to  decide  whether  the  action  should  proceed  in  their\nabsence.  Cf. Imperial v. Castruita, 418 F.Supp.2d 1174, 1178 (C.D.\nCal.  2006)  (declining  to  dismiss  action  for  nonjoinder  where\ndefendant did not present any evidence that certain persons were\nrequired  to  be  joined  under  Rule  19(a)  and,  even  if  so,  they\n“failed to even argue, much less prove, that [the persons] cannot\n7Although  TDHCA  maintains  that  the  Dallas  City  Council\nrecently enforced a moratorium against new LIHTC developments in\nthe City, it presents no evidence to support this assertion or to\ncontradict ICP’s proof that the Dallas City Council is now “willing\nto review applications on all tax credit transactions individually,\nbased upon supply and demand in the project’s submarket.”  P. App.\n51 (quoting Dallas City Council Res. Jan. 23, 2008).  \nTDHCA also argues that the City must be joined because it\noffers bond programs that are a source of funding for low-income\nhousing  projects  in  addition  to  the  tax  credits  available  to\ndevelopers.  ICP’s allegations, however, focus on TDHCA’s alleged\ndisproportionate approval of developers’ tax credit applications,\nand the court can remedy this, if proved, without involving the\nCity’s bond programs.    \n--  2222  --\n\nbe joined in the action”).  Federal courts are reluctant to grant\nmotions to dismiss based on nonjoinder, and the court declines to\ndo so here.  See Teacher Retirement Sys. of Tex. v. Reilly Mortgage\nGroup, Inc., 154 F.R.D. 156, 159 (W.D. Tex. 1994) (citing 7 Charles\nA. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1609\n(1986)).   \n*     *     *\nAccordingly,  for  the  reasons  explained,  the  court  denies\ndefendants’ June 27, 2008 motion to dismiss.\nSO ORDERED.\nDecember 11, 2008.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

The State admits that the \nsegregation is a result of prior and current funding decisions. The admission is set out in the \nfollowing statement.1 \nThe Department's funding allocations, as well as the allocations under the Bond \nReview Board's (BRB) Bond Program should promote racial integration, \nhowever, the continued failure of these entities to evaluate the implications of \nprior and current funding decisions permits the Department and the BRB to \ndisproportionately allocate federal low income housing tax credit funds and the \ntax-exempt bond funds to developments located in impacted areas (above average \n1 The \"Department\" referred to in the finding is the Texas Department of Housing and \nCommunity Affairs. The state's distribution ofthe credits is governed by the Department's \nQualified Allocation Plan referred to as the QAP. The Bond Review Board is the State entity \ncharged with the operation of the State's Private Activity Bond program. These tax-exempt \nbonds are often used in conjunction with Low Income Housing Tax Credits for affordable \nhousing development. \nComplaint  -1-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 2 of 19   PageID 2\nminority concentration and below average income levels). \nFurthermore, QAP provisions requiring multiple notifications to state and local \npolitical officials and neighborhood organizations are feared to enable \"Not-In \nMy-Backyard\" (NIMBY) opposition to developments that are proposed in non \nimpacted areas (above average minority concentration and below average income \nlevels). \nThe vast majority of low income housing tax credits and tax-exempt bonds that \nfund developments in the Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and Houston metropolitan \nareas have been placed in impacted areas. \nThe Department's funding decisions arise directly out of the QAP. In recent years, \nthe QAP has continued to place low income individuals in impacted areas, further \nadding to the concentration problem in most cities today. House Committee On \nUrban Affairs Texas House of Representatives, \"Interim Report 2006 A Report to \nthe House of Representatives 801 Texas Legislature\", December 6, 2006, Robert \nh \nTalton, Chairman, Findings page 48. \n2. Despite this admission, the entity operating the State's Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit program, the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (\"TDHCA\"), has not \ntaken the actions necessary to remedy the segregation. Instead, TDHCA continues to perpetuate \nthe concentration ofTDHCA's Low Income Housing Tax Credit assisted housing in low-income \nminority areas. \n3. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (\"ICP\") is a Dallas based fair housing and \ncivil rights organization. ICP focuses on the issue of racial segregation and policies and practices \nthat operate to exclude low income families from higher opportunity, predominately White or \nnon-minority  areas of the Dallas metropolitan area. The term \"White\" and the term \"non-\nminority\" are used in this complaint to refer to the 2000 U.S. Census category for persons of the \nWhite race who are also not Hispanic or Latino. In furtherance ofiCP's mission, ICP assists \nBlack or African American Dallas Housing Authority Section 8 families in finding housing \nComplaint  -2-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 3 of 19   PageID 3\nopportunities in the suburban communities in the Dallas area. The assistance includes efforts to \nmake units in Low Income Housing Tax Credit assisted properties available for ICP's clients. \nThe Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects cannot refuse to rent to Section 8 tenants because \nthe tenants are on the Section 8 voucher program. Texas Government Code 2306.269(b ). \nTDHCA's failure to correct the disproportionate allocation of housing tax credits to low income \nminority areas directly interferes with ICP's ability to find housing for its clients in the higher \nopportunity, predominately White areas of the Dallas metropolitan area. \n4. ICP seeks injunctive relief for defendants' segregation of Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit assisted developments into low income and minority concentrated locations in the Dallas \nmetropolitan area. \nJurisdiction \n5. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a). \nThe Inclusive Communities Project, Inc - plaintiff. \n6. The plaintifflnclusive Communities Project (\"ICP\") is a fair housing focused nonprofit \norganization which works with families seeking to obtain and retain housing in predominately \nnon-minority areas of the Dallas metropolitan area. This is part ofiCP's work to break down \nbarriers to the creation of racially and economically inclusive communities. Specifically, ICP \nworks with Black or African American families participating in the Section 8 Housing Choice \nVoucher program (the \"Section 8 program\") administered by the Dallas Housing Authority \n(\"DHA\"). ICP assists DHA Section 8 program families who choose to lease dwelling units in \nnon-minority areas with counseling and financial assistance.  ICP's office is located in the City of \nDallas, Dallas County, Texas. \nComplaint  -3-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 4 of 19   PageID 4\nDefendants \n7. TDHCA is a corporate and political body established by the laws of the State of Texas. \nTDHCA is responsible for administering the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program in \nthe state of Texas. The references to TDHCA in this complaint also include the actions ofthe \nExecutive Director and the TDHCA board members in their official capacity. \n8. Mr. Michael Gerber is the current Executive Director ofTDHCA. Mr. Gerber is named \nas a defendant in this suit solely in his official capacity. \n9. Ms. Leslie Bingham-Escarefio, Mr. Tomas Cardenas, P.E., Mr. C. Kent Conine, Chair, \nMr. Dionicio Vidal (Sonny) Flores, Dr. Juan Sanchez Mufioz, and Ms. Gloria L. Ray are the \ncurrent members of the TDHCA Board. These individuals are named as defendants in this suit \nsolely in their official capacity. The board members are responsible for adopting the Qualified \nAllocation Plan, setting TDHCA policy concerning the Low Income Housing Tax Credit \nprogram, and for making the decisions on which applications receive Low Income Housing Tax \nCredits. \nThe Low Income Housing Tax Credit program. \n10. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program receives authority from the U.S. \nTreasury Department to provide tax credits to offset federal income taxes for investors in low \nincome multifamily rental housing. The developers of the housing sell the credits to syndicators \nor investors. The sale of the tax credits provides the capital for the construction of the housing. \nThe targeted beneficiaries of the program are very low and extremely low income families. The \nprogram was created in 1986 and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 42. \nWhile the amount of tax credits varies annually, Texas received an allocation of approximately \nComplaint  -4-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 5 of 19   PageID 5\n$43 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits in 2007. TDHCA approves approximately \n6,000 to 7,000 additional units for Low Income Housing Tax Credits every year. TDHCA reports \nthat there were at least 127,000 units in its Low Income Housing Tax Credit inventory as of May \n2007. TDHCA is the only entity in the state with the authority to allocate tax credits under this \nprogram. TDHCA's procedures and standards for the allocation and distribution ofthe tax credits \nare contained in TDHCA's annual Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP). \n11. TDHCA's annual QAP contains a complex set of requirements for establishing \nthreshold eligibility and applying selection criteria to applications for housing tax credits. Under \nTexas law TDHCA's final decisions allocating tax credits are made as an exercise ofTDHCA's \ndiscretion. TDHCA's discretion can take into account numerous factors not included in the \nQAP's threshold eligibility or selection criteria. QAP 50.10(a). TDHCA's practice is to use its \ndiscretion in making the housing tax credit allocation decisions. \nTDHCA uses race and ethnicity as one factor in its decision whether to award Low \nIncome Housing Tax credits and this factor is a cause of the segregation and other \ndiscrimination. \n12. The objective circumstantial evidence shows that the pattern found by the House \nCommittee on Urban Affairs- TDHCA's placement of the vast majority of urban low income \nhousing tax credit housing in minority concentrated areas- is the result ofTDHCA decisions \nwhich take into account the race and ethnicity of the residents of the area in which the project is \nto be located and which take into account the race and ethnicity of the probable residents of the \nproject.  Those decisions are made in a manner that causes racial and ethnic segregation in the \ntax credit program in violation of the constitutional and statutory prohibitions against racial and \nethnic segregation. \nComplaint  -5-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 6 of 19   PageID 6\n13. The House Committee On Urban Affairs Texas House of Representatives found that \nTDHCA disproportionately allocated urban area Low Income Housing Tax Credit funds to \ndevelopments located in minority concentrated areas. House Committee On Urban Affairs Texas \nHouse of Representatives, \"Interim Report 2006 A Report to the House of Representatives 80th \nTexas Legislature\", December 6, 2006, Robert Talton, Chairman, Findings page 48. The \ndistribution ofthe existing TDHCA Low Income Housing Tax Credit project unit inventory is \ndisproportionately concentrated in minority areas as compared to the distribution of all renter \noccupied housing. \n14. Texas has a segregated LIHTC housing program according to a U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development report. Over 60% ofLIHTC units in Texas are in U.S. Census \ntracts where more than 50% of the population is minority according to the report. Only \nConnecticut, California, New Mexico, Washington, D.C., and Hawaii are listed in the report with \nhigher percentages ofLIHTC units in census tracts with 50% or greater minority population than \nTexas.  The state wide pattern is duplicated  in the Dallas area. The report states that in the Dallas \nPMSA, 65% of the LIHTC units are in 50% or greater minority census tracts. Office of \nEconomic Affairs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy \nDevelopment and Research, \"Updating the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Database \nProjects Placed in Service Through 2003, \"(2006) pages 76-78, 130. \n15. Only 14.5% ofTDHCA's Low Income Housing Tax Credit non-elderly units are \nlocated in 70% to 100% White census tracts throughout the State. Forty-eight percent, 48%, are \nlocated in 0% to 30% White Census tracts. The distribution ofTDHCA's Low Income Housing \nTax Credit project unit inventory in the City of Dallas and in Dallas County is more concentrated \nComplaint  -6-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 7 of 19   PageID 7\nin minority areas than the state wide distribution and shows that race was at least one factor in \nthe allocation of the tax credits. \n16. While 19% of all renter occupied units in the City of Dallas are located in \npredominantly White 70% to 100% White census tracts, only 2.9% ofTDHCA's Low Income \nHousing Tax Credit units in the City are in those 70% to 100% White census tracts. A \ncorresponding disparate distribution is found in the City of Dallas minority concentrated census \ntracts. While only 51% of all renter occupied units in the City are in minority concentrated census \ntracts with a population of from 0% to 30% White, 85% ofTDHCA's Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit units in the City are in those 0% to 30% White census tracts. While 14% of all renter \noccupied units in Dallas County are located in 70% to 100% White census tracts, only 2.8% of \nTDHCA's tax credit units in Dallas County are in 70% to 100% White census tracts. While only \n38% of all renter occupied units in Dallas County are in 0% to 30% White census tracts, 71% of \nTDHCA's tax credit units in Dallas County are in 0% to 30% White census tracts. \n17. TDHCA is less likely to deny tax credits for a project in a predominantly White area \nifthe population eligible for and likely to reside in that project is disproportionately White. Rural \nareas with a predominantly White population and a predominantly White eligible population are \none example of areas where TDHCA will approve housing tax credits for projects in White areas. \nThere are 29 Low Income Housing Tax Credit family -non-elderly - projects with a total of \n1,439 units for which TDHCA has racial and ethnic occupancy data and which are in 90% or \ngreater White census tracts in the State.  The population in these TDHCA Low Income Housing \nTax Credit projects in 90% or greater White census tracts is only 8% Hispanic or Latino and 6% \nBlack or African American according to the data in TDHCA's 2007 Housing Sponsor Report and \nComplaint  -7-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 8 of 19   PageID 8\n07-Propertylnventory Report. All but two of the projects and 409 of the units are in small towns \nwith less than 30,000 population. The population in these small towns averages 88% White. \n18. An example ofTDHCA awarding Low Income Housing Tax Credits in a \npredominantly White area where minority residents are unlikely to use the tax credit supported \nunits is the town of Vidor. TDHCA has approved two Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects \nin the all White town of Vidor, one in 1994 and another in 2006. Vidor has a 2000 U.S. Census \npopulation of 11,440. The 2000 Census reports eight Black or African Americans in Vidor. There \nare no Blacks or African Americans in the TDHCA Vidor LIHTC project that was approved in \n1994. There is no occupancy reported for the project approved in 2006. The likelihood of many \nBlack or African American families seeking occupancy at either of these Low Income Housing \nTax Credit projects in Vidor is small given the modem history of opposition to Blacks living in \nVidor's low income housing. Federal attempts to desegregate the public housing in Vidor during \nthe 1990s were met with and defeated by overt racial hostility and resistance by the Ku Klux \nKlan. State ofTex. v. Knights ofKu Klux Klan, 58 F.3d 1075, 1077 (5th Cir. 1995). \n19. Elderly projects are another example ofTDHCA approving Low Income Housing Tax \nCredits for units in predominantly White areas for which the probable residents are also \npredominantly White. The state wide population occupying Low Income Housing Tax Credit \nunits for elderly tenants in 90% or greater White census tracts is only 1% Hispanic or Latino and \nis less than 1% Black or African American according to the data in TDHCA's 2007 Housing \nSponsor Report and other reports. \n20. TDHCA disproportionately refuses to approve Low Income Housing Tax Credit \nfunding for non-elderly projects in predominantly White census tracts compared to its approval \nComplaint  -8-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 9 of 19   PageID 9\nrate for predominantly White elderly projects in predominantly White census tracts. From 1999 \nthrough 2006, TDHCA awarded tax credits for approximately 67% of the elderly units in \napplications for 90% or greater White census tracts. TDHCA awarded tax credits for only 32% of \nthe non-elderly units in applications for  90% or greater White census tracts during the same \nperiod. \n21. TDHCA disproportionately refuses to approve Low Income Housing Tax Credit \nfunding for non-elderly projects in predominantly White census tracts compared to its approval \nrate for non-elderly projects in minority census tracts. From 1999 through 2006 TDHCA awarded \ntax credits for only 32% of the Non-elderly units in all applications for 90% or greater White \ncensus tracts. During the same period, TDHCA awarded tax credits for approximately 47% of the \nnon-elderly units in all applications for 0% to 10% White census tracts. Approximately 2% of all \napproved non-elderly units were in 90% or greater White census tracts. Approximately 27% of \nall approved non-elderly units were in 0 to 10% White census tracts. \n22. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects are racially and ethnically segregated \nby occupancy characteristics as well as by location. The total population in the units in TDHCA's \nLow Income Housing Tax Credit projects located in 90% or greater White census tracts is only \n5% Hispanic or Latino and 4% Black or African Americanly occupied according to the data in \nTDHCA's 2007 Housing Sponsor Report. The units in TDHCA's Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit projects in the non-White, 0 to 10% White, census tracts are 88% Black and Hispanic \noccupied -40% Hispanic or Latino and 48% Black or African American - according to the data \nin TDHCA's 2007 Housing Sponsor Report. \n23.  The facts concerning the geographical distribution and occupancy ofTDHCA's Low \nComplaint  -9-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 10 of 19   PageID 10\nIncome Housing Tax Credit projects as well as the results ofthe applications for the tax credits \nare based on TDHCA and other government reports. State law requires TDHCA to collect Fair \nHousing Sponsor Reports from the owners of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit assisted \nprojects. Tex. Gov't. Code 2306.0624. However, the TDHCA reports are collected and \nmaintained in a manner that inhibits and obstructs the accurate portrayal of the racial effects of \nTDHCA's decisions. TDHCA does not collect the information from all owners. Plaintiff has \nattempted to correct the information to the extent possible and practical. \nThe use of race as a factor subjects minority tenants to slum and blighted \nconditions. \n24. TDHCA's use of race as a factor in its decisions to allocate Low Income Housing Tax \nCredits subjects the minority residents of those units in the City of Dallas to severe conditions of \nslum and blight. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects in the City of Dallas are located \nin minority neighborhoods with high crime and high poverty rates and that are blighted by \nindustrial uses and obnoxious facilities such as illegal landfills. These neighborhoods are also \nsubjected to unequal zoning and are already used for low-income housing as shown by the \nnumber of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers in those tracts. \n25. There are 115 Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects listed in the TDHCA \ninventory in the City of Dallas. Thirty-two ofthe projects are located in tracts with heavy \nindustrial zoning. Twenty-seven of the projects are located in tracts with other industrial zoning. \nTwo Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects, the Villas of Sorrento at 3130 Stag Road and the \nOakwood Place Apartments at 4950 Wadsworth are adjacent to the large illegal City demolition \nlandfill known as the Curry site. There are five Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects within \na half mile radius of the Deepwood Dump, the largest illegal dumpsite in the State of Texas. \nComplaint  -10-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 11 of 19   PageID 11\n26. Fifteen percent, 15%, ofthe Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects in the City of \nDallas are in U.S. Census tracts with poverty rates equal to or greater than 40%. This is twice the \nnational average of 7.6% of all Low Income Housing Tax Credit units that are located in 40% or \ngreater poverty census tracts. Thirty-six of the Dallas Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects \nare in census tracts with poverty rates equal to or greater than 30%. The average poverty rate for \nthe Dallas census tracts with Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects is 28.44%. The Dallas \nPMSA average poverty rate is 11%. The average median family income for the Dallas Low \nIncome Housing Tax Credit census tracts is $29,641 which is 53% of the Dallas PMSA $55,854 \nmedian family income. Fifty-three ofthe housing tax credit projects in the City of Dallas are \nlocated in census tracts where the median family income is equal to half or less than half of the \nDallas PMSA median family income. These low income and high poverty locations deny the \nLow Income Housing Tax Credit residents an equal opportunity for a safe environment, quality \neducation, and adequate public and private services. \n27. TDHCA's use of race as a factor in its decisions to award Low Income Housing Tax \nCredits denies safe housing to the Dallas residents of Low Income Housing Tax Credit units. \nThe average violent 2004 crime rate by census tract for tracts with Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit projects was 137 crimes per 1,000 persons. The city-wide rate was 35 crimes per 1,000 \npersons. There were nine Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects in census tracts with violent \ncrime rates greater than 200. There were 14 Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects in census \ntracts with violent crime rates greater than 100. There were 37 Low Income Housing Tax Credit \nprojects in census tracts with crime rates higher than the City average. \n28. TDHCA's use of race as a factor in its decisions to award Low Income Housing Tax \nComplaint  -11-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 12 of 19   PageID 12\nCredits causes the Low Income Housing Tax Credit affordable housing opportunities in the \nDallas area to be disproportionately located in the slum and blighted neighborhoods in the City of \nDallas. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit units in the City ofDallas are 79% of all Low \nIncome Housing Tax Credit units in Dallas County and 64% of all Low Income Housing Tax \nCredit units in Collin, Dallas, and Denton counties. \nICP Standing. \n29. ICP seeks to create and obtain affordable housing opportunities in non-minority \nconcentrated areas for persons eligible for low rent public housing and to provide the counseling \nand other forms of assistance to Black families seeking to use their DHA Section 8 voucher to \nmove into low-poverty, non-minority concentrated areas throughout the Dallas metropolitan area. \nICP provides mobility counseling and mobility assistance to Black Section 8 families seeking \nhousing opportunities in non-minority concentrated and non-poverty concentrated parts of the \nDallas metropolitan area. \n30. The counseling assistance provided by ICP to Black DHA Section 8 participants \nincludes pre-move family counseling and related financial assistance to assist the families who \nwant to make and sustain a desegregative housing move. The mobility assistance includes \nnegotiating with landlords as necessary to obtain units in the eligible areas at rents that are \naffordable by the Section 8 families and eligible for the Section 8 subsidy. The financial \nassistance provided to these families by ICP includes the payment of application fees, security \ndeposits and utility deposits to assist families moving into housing that provides desegregative \nhousing opportunities in non-minority, non-poverty concentrated areas, where such assistance is \nnecessary to make the desegregative move possible. ICP also makes landlord incentive bonus \nComplaint  -12-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 13 of 19   PageID 13\npayments to landlords who agree to participate in DHA's Section 8 program and provide \ndesegregative housing opportunities in non-minority, non-poverty concentrated areas when such \nincentives are necessary to secure housing for the Section 8 families. Section 8 families may also \nreceive ICP assistance in the form of a contribution to their reasonable moving expenses in order \nto make a move in an eligible area. \n31.  ICP's clients are Black or African American families participating in the DHA's \nSection 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. \n32. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit units are important to ICP in its provision of \nintegrated housing opportunities for its clients. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects \ncannot refuse to rent to an applicant based on the applicant's status as a Section 8 participant. A \nlarge percentage of non-tax credit projects in White, high opportunity areas do refuse to rent to \nSection 8 families. ICP's survey of383 apartments in the predominantly White suburbs in the \nDallas metropolitan area found only 70 that would accept Section 8 families. Twenty-six of those \n70 were tax credit projects. \n33. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects that take DHA Section 8 voucher \nparticipants are a significant source of units used in the DHA Section 8 program. However, the \nlarge majority of those tax credit projects are currently segregated in minority areas in the City of \nDallas. The DHA March 2006 Section 8 occupancy report showed that: \nA. 20% or 3,348 of the 16,190 DHA March 2006 Section 8 voucher households were in \nLow Income Housing Tax Credit units. \nB. Only 80 of the 3,348, 2%, were in 70% or more White census tracts. \nC.  Over 2,375 of the 3,348, 71%, were in 0 to 30% White tracts. \nComplaint  -13-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 14 of 19   PageID 14\n34. Since the Low Income Housing Tax Credit units cannot refuse to accept Section 8 and \nthe units usually rent for amounts less than Section 8 maximum rents, it is possible for ICP to \nobtain these units for its clients using fewer person hours of assistance and at a lower out of \npocket cost. But most of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit units are in minority areas and thus \nare not eligible for ICP's assistance. As a result, ICP must rely on the private market in the \npredominantly White areas. The private market in those areas is reluctant to accept Section 8 and \ndoes so only at a higher cost to ICP and its clients. The lack of Low Income Housing Tax Credit \nunits in White areas injures ICP in its capacity providing assistance to minority clients seeking \nhousing in those areas. \n35. There is a higher probability that economic and racial integration can be achieved in \nLow Income Housing Tax Credit projects. Because the tax credit projects can also rent to higher \nincome tenants who are not Section 8 participants, there is a higher probability of economic and \nracial integration than in traditional project based subsidy program units. Tax credit projects are \nthus more likely to offer ICP's clients a housing opportunity that is affordable and integrated. \nICP can obtain tax credit units for its clients at a lower cost in ICP resources because the tax \ncredit projects cannot discriminate against Section 8 and the rents are likely to be less than the \nmaximum rents for the Section 8 program. \n36. By denying financial assistance for units that would located in non-minority areas and \nthus making standard quality, non-luxury rental housing unavailable in non-minority areas, \nTDHCA's Low Income Housing Tax Credit decisions to award or deny the credits have directly \nand adversely affected ICP by: \nA. reducing the number of units that ICP can use to help its clients find housing in non-\nComplaint  -14-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 15 of 19   PageID 15\nminority concentrated market areas, \nB. increasing the amount of time per client that ICP must spend in order to help its clients \nfind and retain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated areas, \nC. increasing the amount of financial assistance that ICP must spend because of the \nhigher rents and other costs in the non-Low Income Housing Tax Credit units in order to help its \nclients find and retain modest rental housing in non-minority concentrated market areas, and \nD. discouraging families with which ICP works from choosing dwelling units in market \nareas that offer racially integrated housing because of the cost factors involved in such a choice. \nClaims for relief. \n37. Defendants' actions make dwellings unavailable because of race, color, and national \norigin in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). \n38. Defendants' actions make financial assistance for constructing dwellings unavailable \nbecause of race, color, and national origin in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a). \n39. Defendants' actions using race and ethnicity as one factor in their decisions \nconcerning the allocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits violates the l41 Amendment to \nh \nthe U.S. Constitution and is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n40. Defendants' actions using race and ethnicity as one factor in their decisions \nconcerning the allocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits violates 42 U.S.C. § 1982 that \nrequires the defendants to give all citizens of the United States the same right as is enjoyed by \nWhite citizens to, lease real property. \nPrayer for relief. \nPlaintiff requests the following relief: \nComplaint  -15-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 16 of 19   PageID 16\nA. Injunctive relief requiring defendants to allocate Low Income Housing Tax Credits in \nthe Dallas metropolitan area in a manner that creates as many Low Income Housing Tax Credit \nassisted units in non-minority census tracts as exist in minority census tracts. This relief shall not \nalso prohibit the approval of units in minority census tracts if: \n(i) the defendants' approval rates for Low Income Housing Tax Credit units in minority \ncensus tracts in the Dallas metropolitan area does not exceed the approval rate for Low Income \nHousing Tax Credit units in non-minority census tracts, and \n(ii) the approved projects in the minority census tracts do not contain a higher percentage \nof low income residents than the percentage of low income residents in the projects approved in \nthe non-minority census tracts. \nB. Injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from causing or perpetuating racial and \nethnic segregation in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program by denying Low Income \nHousing Tax Credits to units in the Dallas metropolitan area when such denial is made by taking \nthe race and ethnicity of the residents of the area in which the project is to be located and the race \nand ethnicity of the probable residents of the project into account. \nC. Injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from approving financial assistance in the \nform of Low Income Housing Tax Credits to applications in the Dallas metropolitan area unless \nthe site and neighborhoods in which the units will be located meet the following conditions: \n(i) The site and neighborhood must be suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and \nfurthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. \n(ii) The site must promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue \nComplaint  -16-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 17 of 19   PageID 17\nconcentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons. \n(iii) The site must be free from adverse environmental conditions, natural or manmade, \nsuch as instability, flooding, septic tank back-ups, sewage hazards or mudslides; harmful air \npollution, smoke or dust; excessive noise, vehicular traffic, nearby industrial zoning and \nindustrial uses, rodent or vermin infestation; or fire hazards. The neighborhood must not be one \nwhich is seriously detrimental to family life or in which substandard dwellings or other \nundesirable elements such as high crime rates predominate, unless there is actively in progress a \nconcerted program to remedy the undesirable conditions and those conditions will be eliminated \nbefore the housing is occupied. \n(iv) The housing must be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and \nhealth facilities and services, and other municipal facilities and services that are at least \nequivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of similar unassisted \nstandard housing. \nD. Injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from administering the Low Income Housing \nTax Credit program in a manner that causes or perpetuates racial and ethnic segregation. \nE. Injunctive relief requiring defendants to comply with and implement reporting and \nmonitoring requirements, including those imposed by state law, that demonstrate compliance \nwith the obligation to make Low Income Housing Tax Credit units available in a manner that \ndoes not perpetuate segregation and in a manner that reduces the probability of future violations. \nF. an award of litigation expenses, attorney fees, and court costs, and \nG. any other appropriate relief. \nComplaint  -17-\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 1   Filed 03/28/08    Page 18 of 19   PageID 18\nRespectfully Submitted~ . \n0 \n'~  ·f\\~  '-r'. ~~9'   \\.. 9.~ ...'\" ~\"' ~-'  ~ \nMichael M.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nDALLAS DIVISION\nTHE INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES     §\nPROJECT, INC.,     §\n    §\nPlaintiff,     §\n    §  Civil Action No. 3:08-CV-0546-D\nVS.     §\n    §\nTHE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF       §\nHOUSING AND COMMUNITY     §\nAFFAIRS, et al.,     §\n    §\nDefendants.     §\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n           AND ORDER           \nThis lawsuit challenging the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs’\n(“TDHCA’s”) allocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”) in the Dallas\nmetropolitan area requires the court to decide whether plaintiff has proved that TDHCA\nintentionally discriminated based on race, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1982, or that TDHCA’s allocation decisions had a\ndisparate racial impact, in violation of §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act\n(“FHA”).  Following a summary judgment decision and a bench trial, and for the reasons that\nfollow,1 the court finds that plaintiff has proved its disparate impact claim under the FHA,\n1The court sets out in this memorandum opinion and order its findings of fact and\nconclusions of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(1).  Although the court has carefully\nconsidered the trial testimony and exhibits, this memorandum opinion and order has been\nwritten to comply with the level of detail required in this circuit for findings of fact and\nconclusions of law.  See, e.g., Century Marine Inc. v. United States, 153 F.3d 225, 231 (5th\nCir. 1998) (discussing standards).  The court has not set out its findings and conclusions in\n\nbut it otherwise finds in favor of defendants.\nI\nA\nThis is an action by plaintiff The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (“ICP”) against\ndefendants TDHCA and its Executive Director and board members in their official capacities\nunder the FHA, the Fourteenth Amendment (actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), and 42\nU.S.C. § 1982.  ICP is a non-profit organization that seeks racial and socioeconomic\nintegration  in  the  Dallas  metropolitan  area.    In  particular,  ICP  assists  low-income,\npredominately  African-American  families  who  are  eligible  for  the  Dallas  Housing\nAuthority’s Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (“Section 8”) in finding affordable\nhousing in predominately Caucasian,2 suburban neighborhoods.  Because under the LIHTC\nprogram a development that receives tax credits cannot refuse housing solely because a\nperson is using a Section 8 voucher, it is important to ICP where the developments are\nlocated in the Dallas metropolitan area. \nThis lawsuit arises from TDHCA’s allocation of LIHTC in the Dallas metropolitan\narea.  Under § 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (“I.R.C.”), the government provides tax\npunctilious detail, slavishly traced the claims issue by issue and witness by witness, or\nindulged in exegetics, parsing or declaiming every fact and each nuance and hypothesis.  It\nhas instead written a memorandum opinion and order that contains findings and conclusions\nthat provide a clear understanding of the basis for the court's decision.  See id.\n2In this memorandum opinion and order, the term “Caucasian” means white persons\nwho are neither Hispanic nor Latino.\n- 2 -\n\ncredits that a state distributes to developers through a designated state agency.  See id. \nTDHCA is the agency designated by the Texas Legislature to administer the program in\nTexas.  See Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.053(b)(10) (West 2008) (“The department may .\n. . administer federal housing, community affairs, or community development programs,\nincluding the low income housing tax credit program.”).  Developers apply to TDHCA for\ntax credits, which can be sold to finance construction of a housing project.  \nTDHCA issues two types of LIHTC: 4% tax credits3 and 9% tax credits.  The 9% tax\ncredits are distributed on an annual cycle and are generally oversubscribed.  Certain federal\nand state laws dictate, at least in part, the manner in which TDHCA can select the\napplications that will receive 9% tax credits.  First, I.R.C. § 42 requires that the designated\nstate agency adopt a “Qualified Allocation Plan” (“QAP”) that prescribes the “selection\ncriteria.”  See id. at § 42(m)(1)(A)-(B).4  The QAP must include, inter alia, certain selection\ncriteria, see id. at § 42(m)(1)(C),5 and preferences, see id. at § 42(m)(1)(B);6 otherwise,\n3It appears that the actual name of 4% tax credits is “Tax-Exempt Bond.”  See Tr. 2:12\n(referring to P. Ex. 125 at 60 and noting that the term “Tax-Exempt Bond Developments” is\n“4% tax credits.”); P. Ex. 1 at 19; P. Ex. 125 at 28.  The court will use the terms “4% tax\ncredit” and “4% tax credits” because the parties and TDHCA appear to do so.  See P. Ex. 490\nat 17 (“[T]he non-competitive, or the 4 percent credits, as you’ll normally hear us refer to\nthem in the Board meetings . . . [are] allocated with private activity bonds.”); see also, e.g.,\nTr. 4:11-15.\n4ICP also calls the selection criteria the 9% point scoring and ranking system.  This\nmay result from the fact that Texas law obligates TDHCA to score and rank applications\nagainst  selection  criteria  that  prioritize  certain  criteria.    See  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  Ann.\n§ 2306.6710(b) (West 2001).\n5I.R.C. § 42(m)(1)(C) provides, in relevant part: \n- 3 -\n\n“zero” housing credit dollars will be provided, see id. at § 42(m)(1)(A).  Second, the Texas\nGovernment Code regulates how  TDHCA administers the LIHTC program.  The Code\nrequires TDHCA to adopt annually a QAP and corresponding manual.  Id. at § 2306.67022.7 \nThe selection criteria set forth in a qualified allocation plan must\ninclude—\n(i) project location,\n(ii) housing needs characteristics,\n(iii)  project  characteristics,  including  whether  the  project\nincludes the use of existing housing as part of a community\nrevitalization plan,\n(iv) sponsor characteristics,\n(v) tenant populations with special housing needs,\n(vi) public housing waiting lists,\n(vii) tenant populations of individuals with children,\n(viii) projects intended for eventual tenant ownership,\n(ix) the energy efficiency of the project, and\n(x) the historic nature of the project.\nId. \n6I.R.C. § 42(m)(1)(B) provides, in relevant part: \n[T]he term “qualified allocation plan” means any plan— . . .\nwhich . . . gives preference in allocating housing credit dollar\namounts among selected projects to--\n(I) projects serving the lowest income tenants,\n(II) projects obligated to serve qualified tenants for the longest\nperiods, and\n(III) projects which are located in qualified census tracts (as\ndefined in subsection (d)(5)(C)) and the development of which\ncontributes to a concerted community revitalization plan[.]\nId. \n7Section 2306.67022 was amended in 2011.  It now requires TDHCA to adopt a QAP\nand corresponding manual only biennially, with the discretion to do so annually.  See Tex.\nGov’t Code Ann. § 2306.67022 (West 2011).  The court refers to the 2001 version, instead\nof the 2011 amended version, because the parties rely on the 2001 version.  And the court\n- 4 -\n\nIt also sets out how TDHCA is to evaluate applications.  TDHCA must first “determine\nwhether the application satisfies the threshold criteria” in the QAP.  Id. at § 2306.6710(a). \nApplications that meet the threshold criteria are then “score[d] and rank[ed]” by “a point\nsystem” that “prioritizes in descending order” ten listed statutory criteria (also called “above-\nthe-line criteria”), which directly affects TDHCA’s discretion in creating the “selection\ncriteria” in each QAP.  Id. at § 2306.6710(b).8  The Texas Attorney General has interpreted\nis primarily relying on the statute to provide a basic understanding of the Texas LIHTC\nprogram during the period that preceded the filing of this lawsuit.  As of the date of this\nmemorandum opinion and order, it appears that it is still the TDHCA’s practice to adopt a\nQAP annually.  See Ds. Dec. 7, 2011 Br. 13 (“The TDHCA administers its LIHTC program\nthrough a unique, legislatively-mandated QAP re-written each year.”).\n8The ten statutory criteria are: \n(A)  financial  feasibility  of  the  development  based  on  the\nsupporting financial data required in the application that will\ninclude a project underwriting pro forma from the permanent or\nconstruction lender;\n(B) quantifiable community participation with respect to the\ndevelopment, evaluated on the basis of written statements from\nany neighborhood organizations on record with the state or\ncounty in which the development is to be located and whose\nboundaries contain the proposed development site;\n(C) the income levels of tenants of the development;\n(D) the size and quality of the units;\n(E) the commitment of development funding by local political\nsubdivisions;\n(F) the level of community support for the application, evaluated\non the basis of written statements from the state representative\nor the state senator that represents the district containing the\nproposed development site;\n(G) the rent levels of the units;\n(H) the cost of the development by square foot;\n(I) the services to be provided to tenants of the development;\n- 5 -\n\nthis provision to obligate TDHCA to “use a point system that prioritizes the [statutory]\ncriteria in that specific order.”  Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. No. GA-0208, 2004 WL 1434796, at *4\n(2004).  Although the Texas Government Code does not mandate the points to be accorded\neach statutory criterion, “the statute must be construed to require [TDHCA] to assign more\npoints to the first criterion than to the second, and so on, in order to effectuate the mandate\nthat the scoring system ‘prioritiz[e the criteria] in descending order.’”  Id. (quoting Tex.\nGov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6710(b)(1) (West 2004)).  And while TDHCA can consider other\ncriteria  and  preferences  (also  called  “below-the-line”  criteria),  it  “lacks  discretionary\nauthority to intersperse other factors into the ranking system that will have greater points\nthan” the statutory criteria.  Id. at *6 (citation and internal quotation omitted).  Once TDHCA\nadopts a QAP, it submits the plan to the Governor, who can “approve, reject, or modify and\napprove” it.  Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6724(b)-(c) (West 2001).  Once approved,\nTDHCA staff review the applications in accordance with the QAP, underwrite applications\nin order “to determine the financial feasibility of the development and an appropriate level\nof housing tax credits,” id. at § 2306.6710(b)(1)(A) & (d), and submit their recommendations\nto TDHCA.  See id. at § 2306.6724(e).  TDHCA then reviews the staff recommendations and\nand\n(J) whether, at the time the complete application is submitted or\nat any time within the two-year period preceding the date of\nsubmission, the proposed development site is located in an area\ndeclared to be a disaster under Section 418.014[.]\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6710(b) (West 2007).\n- 6 -\n\nissues final commitments in accordance with the QAP.  See id. at § 2306.6724(e)-(f).  \nThe 4% tax credit, on the other hand, is a non-competitive program, available to\napplicants on a year-round basis.  See P. Ex. 1 at 19, 46.  The federal government provides\nstates private activity bonds, see I.R.C. §§ 42 and 142, that are distributed in Texas by\nseveral issuers, including TDHCA.  Developers can apply to TDHCA for a 4% tax credit to\nbe allocated in addition to a bond, particularly the multifamily housing bond.  In awarding\nthe tax credit, TDHCA “reviews the application for threshold, eligibility and then the\ndevelopment is underwritten.”  P. Ex. 1 at 20; see also Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.67021\n(West 2001) (providing that, with the exception of § 2306.6703 regarding eligibility,\nsubchapter 2306 DD (i.e., from § 2306.6701-.6723) “does not apply to the allocation of\nhousing tax credits to developments financed through the private activity bond program”). \nIn particular, applications for the 4% tax credit are not subject to scoring under the selection\ncriteria.  See P. Ex. 125 at 64 (the 2008 QAP, for example, relieves 4% tax credit applications\nor “Tax-Exempt Bond Developments” from certain sections of the QAP, including § 50.9(I)\nregarding “Selection Criteria.”); see also Tr. 4:12 (“[4% applications] do[] [not] go through\na competitive scoring model where the Board makes a decision on a particular group of\nprojects at any given time.”)  If a developer seeks a multifamily bond allocation from\nTDHCA, it applies to TDHCA, which reviews the application and submits it to the Bond\nReview Board (“BRB”), a separate agency, for the final determination of whether to issue\nan underlying bond.\n- 7 -\n\nB\nICP alleges that, despite federal and state laws governing the QAP, TDHCA is\npermitted under Texas law to exercise discretion in making final decisions regarding the\nallocation of both 4% and 9% tax credits.  It maintains that TDHCA uses this discretion to\nmake housing and financial assistance for housing construction unavailable because of race,\nin violation of §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the FHA.  ICP also alleges that TDHCA has used\nrace as a factor in allocating tax credits under the LIHTC program, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment and of § 1982, which requires that defendants give all United States\ncitizens the same right to lease property as Caucasian citizens.\nIn a prior opinion in this case, the court addressed the parties’ cross-motions for\nsummary judgment.  See Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty.\nAffairs, 749 F.Supp.2d 486 (N.D. Tex. 2010) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (“ICP II”).  It held that ICP\nwas entitled to partial summary judgment establishing the prima facie case component of its\nclaims under the FHA, § 1982, and the Fourteenth Amendment (actionable through § 1983). \nId. at 500 (FHA) and 502 (§ 1982 and Fourteenth Amendment (actionable through § 1983)). \nBecause ICP had met this burden, defendants were obligated with respect to ICP’s\nFHA claim (which was limited to a disparate impact claim, id. at 498 n.10) to prove that\nTDHCA’s actions were in furtherance of a compelling government interest that was bona\nfide and legitimate, and that there were no less discriminatory alternatives.  Id. at 503.  The\ncourt held that defendants had not met their summary judgment burden of establishing that\nTDHCA’s actions furthered a compelling government interest.  In particular, they did not\n- 8 -\n\nestablish that TDHCA could not comply with both I.R.C. § 42 and the FHA.  Id. at  504.\nConcerning ICP’s intentional discrimination claims under § 1982 and the Fourteenth\nAmendment (§ 1983), the court held that defendants had met their burden of producing\nevidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for their actions, id. at 506, but that ICP had\n“presented sufficient evidence that defendants’ proffered reason is pretextual to require a\ntrial.”  Id.\nThe parties presented this case in a bench trial that commenced on August 29, 2011\nand concluded on September 1, 2011.  The court granted the parties’ requests that they\npresent their closing arguments by written submissions.  The final submissions were filed on\nDecember 21, 2011.9 \n9The parties have lodged numerous objections to the testimony and exhibits.  Many\nobjections are immaterial because the court did not rely on the evidence in question when\nmaking its decisions on the merits, or the court relied on the evidence for a limited purpose\nthat is unaffected by whether the objection is well taken.  In a bench trial, it is permissible\nfor the court to hear evidence that it later determines is inadmissible or immaterial to its\ndecisions on the merits.  See Harris v. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339, 346 (1981) (holding that, in a\nbench trial, the court is presumed capable of hearing otherwise inadmissible evidence and\ndisregarding that evidence when making decisions).  Regarding the evidence on which the\ncourt did rely in reaching its decision, the principal objections appear to challenge the\nrelevance of certain evidence and the qualifications of certain witnesses to give expert\ntestimony.  The court overrules the relevance objections that are related to the evidence on\nwhich the court has relied in reaching its decision.  The court concludes that the evidence is\nrelevant, within the meaning of Fed. R. Evid. 401, to whether defendants’ actions violated\nthe FHA, the Fourteenth Amendment, and/or § 1982.  To the extent the parties challenge the\nadmissibility of witnesses who were offered as experts, the court holds that the party offering\nthe testimony has either satisfied the requirements for expert testimony under Fed. R. Evid.\n702 or that the witness was testifying based on personal knowledge as a fact witness rather\nthan offering scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.\n- 9 -\n\nII\nThe court considers together ICP’s claims for intentional discrimination under the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (actionable under § 1983) and § 1982.\nA\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “prohibits intentional\nracial segregation in government-assisted housing.”  ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 501 (citing \nBanks v. Dall. Hous. Auth., 119 F.Supp.2d 636, 638 n. 3 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (Kaplan, J.)).  “To\nstate a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must (1) allege a violation of rights secured by the\nConstitution or laws of the United States and (2) demonstrate that the alleged deprivation was\ncommitted by a person acting under color of state law.”  Id. (quoting Moore v. Dall. Indep.\nSch. Dist., 557 F.Supp.2d 755, 761 (N.D. Tex. 2008) (Fitzwater, C.J.), aff’d, 370 Fed. Appx.\n455 (5th Cir. 2010)).  Section 1982 “prohibits all racial discrimination, private as well as\npublic, with respect to property rights.”  Id.  (quoting Evans v. Tubbe, 657 F.2d 661, 663 n.\n2 (5th Cir. Unit A Sept. 1981)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “To prove claims under\n§ 1982 and the Equal Protection Clause, ICP must demonstrate discriminatory intent, not\nmerely discriminatory effect.”  Id. (citing City of Cuyahoga Falls v. Buckeye Cmty. Hope\nFound., 538 U.S. 188, 195 (2003)); see also Hanson v. Veterans Admin., 800 F.2d 1381,\n1386  (5th  Cir.  1986)  (noting  that  although  FHA  claim  requires  only  showing  of\ndiscriminatory effect, § 1982 claim requires finding of intentional racial discrimination).  \nICP has not introduced direct evidence of intentional discrimination.  Discriminatory\nintent can be proved, however, by circumstantial evidence.  See Vill. of Arlington Heights v.\n- 10 -\n\nMetro. Hous. Dep’t, 429 U.S. 252, 266-68 (1977); Jim Sowell Constr. Co. v. City of Coppell,\n61 F.Supp.2d 542, 546-47 (N.D. Tex. 1999) (Fitzwater, J.) (listing non-exhaustive guiding\nfactors, including (1) the discriminatory effect of the official action, (2) the historical\nbackground of the decision, (3) the specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged\ndecision,  (4)  departures  from  the  normal  procedure,  (5)  departures  from  the  normal\nsubstantive factors, and (6) the legislative or administrative history of the decision).  When\na plaintiff does not present direct evidence of discrimination, the burden-shifting method of\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), applies.  ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d\nat 500.  The court granted partial summary judgment in ICP II, holding that ICP had\nestablished a prima facie case of discriminatory intent.  Id. at 502.  The court recognizes that\nthe “McDonnell Douglas formula . . . is applicable only in a directed verdict or summary\njudgment situation, and is not the proper vehicle for evaluating a case that has been fully tried\non the merits.”  Kanida v. Gulf Coast Med. Pers. LP, 363 F.3d 568, 575 (5th Cir. 2004)\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Powell v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 788 F.2d 279,\n285 (5th Cir. 1986)).  But the court as trier of fact can consider ICP’s prima facie showing,\nand defendants’ explanation for their challenged conduct, when deciding whether ICP has\nproved intentional discrimination.  “The existence of the prima facie case, together with\nevidence that defendants’ proffered explanation for its challenged conduct is pretextual, is\nsufficient to find intentional discrimination.”  ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 498 (citing Reeves\nv. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147 (2000)).  And “the strength of the\nprima facie case can be relevant in determining whether defendants’ proffered explanation\n- 11 -\n\nfor their actions is in fact pretextual.”  Id. (citing Prejean v. Radiology Assocs. of Sw. La.\nInc., 342 Fed. Appx. 946, 950 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam)).\nB\nICP  alleges  that  TDHCA  intentionally  discriminates  based  on  race  by\ndisproportionately  approving  LIHTC  in  predominantly  minority  neighborhoods  and\ndisproportionately denying LIHTC in predominantly Caucasian neighborhoods.  As noted,\nICP  has  not  offered  direct  evidence  of  discriminatory  intent;  instead,  it  relies  on\ncircumstantial proof, including evidence that TDHCA’s justifications for the discriminatory\nimpact of its LIHTC decisions are pretextual.\nICP failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that TDHCA intentionally\ndiscriminates based on race in its LIHTC decisions.  Without discussing the trial evidence\nin punctilious detail, see supra note 1, the court finds that TDHCA offered evidence of its\nobligation to create the selection criteria of each QAP in accordance with governing federal\nand state law.  TDHCA also introduced proof that its staff are responsible for initially scoring\napplications according to the QAP and presenting recommendations for TDHCA’s approval\nor denial.  Multiple witnesses credibly testified that, in making decisions, TDHCA does not\nact with intent to discriminate.\nMoreover, ICP did not prove that TDHCA intentionally discriminates when exercising\nits limited discretion.  ICP asserts that TDHCA can in its discretion ignore the selection\ncriteria made mandatory by the Texas Legislature by issuing forward commitments to 9%\ntax credit applications and by approving 4% tax credit applications, and that this discretion\n- 12 -\n\nis used to intentionally discriminate.  The court finds that TDHCA offered credible evidence\nof nondiscriminatory reasons for approving or denying every application that ICP alleges was\nimproperly approved or denied.10  For example, ICP maintains that TDHCA intentionally\ndiscriminated in denying a 4% tax credit to the Primrose at Stonebrook project located in a\nmajority Caucasian area.  The court finds that TDHCA denied this application because the\nproposed project consisted of only three-bedroom units, and that in 2004 TDHCA was using\nits limited 4% tax credit allocations for projects that had a mix of different size units so that,\namong other reasons, single mothers could afford units in the development.11\nICP also failed to prove that TDHCA withheld its discretionary authority with the\nintent to perpetuate a disparate impact.  In fact, there are several instances when the TDHCA\nBoard attempted to use its limited discretion to deconcentrate LIHTC developments in high-\nminority areas and encourage development in “high opportunity areas” preferred by ICP and\n10Although the court finds below, see infra § III(C), that TDHCA could have used its\ndiscretion to issue forward commitments in order to decrease the disparate impact of its\ndecisions, ICP did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that TDHCA intentionally\ndiscriminates on the basis of race when deciding whether to make a forward commitment.\n11The court finds that other challenged examples were also approved or denied for\nnondiscriminatory reasons.  For instance, the Chaparral Townhomes project was a 9% tax\ncredit  applicant  that  scored  well  enough  to  receive  LIHTC,  but  TDHCA  denied  the\napplication because the developer was a former TDHCA board member who had in the past\nreceived four LIHTC allocations.  In response to recent criminal charges against a former\nTDHCA board member and pressure from the Texas Legislature to spread tax credits among\ndevelopers, TDHCA determined that it should avoid the appearance of impropriety and\nadhere to the Legislature’s request by not awarding tax credits to a former board member\nwho had received LIHTC on four prior occasions.  The credits were given instead to a\ndeveloper who had never received LIHTC.\n- 13 -\n\nother organizations.  For example, in 2003, TDHCA board member Shadrick Bogany stated\nduring a Board meeting that he was “tired” of the Board’s approving LIHTC projects in a\nmanner that led to the concentration of LIHTC projects in high-minority areas.  Shortly\nthereafter, the Texas Legislature responded to concerns about the concentration of LIHTC\nin high-minority areas by amending the statutes that governed the LIHTC program, and those\nchanges were implemented by TDHCA in the 2004 QAP.  The new rules sought to\ndeconcentrate housing by imposing certain limitations on LIHTC project concentrations,\nsuch as the one mile/one year rule, the one mile/three year rule, and the twice per capita rule. \nThe one mile/one year rule prevents TDHCA from approving two LIHTC projects within one\nlinear mile of each other within the same allocation year in counties with populations\nexceeding one million.  The one mile/three year rule prevents TDHCA from approving an\nLIHTC project that is within one linear mile of the same type of LIHTC project built within\nthree years preceding the new project application, unless the local government votes\nspecifically to allow the construction.  And the twice per capita rule requires developers who\npropose a project in a municipality or county that contains more than twice the state average\nof units per capita supported by LIHTC to obtain a resolution from the municipality or\ncounty approving the new development.\nMoreover, TDHCA independently took steps to deconcentrate LIHTC projects in\nhigh-minority areas.  After ICP’s President testified before TDHCA in 2004 and requested\nthat, as part of the selection criteria, TDHCA give four additional points to projects that\nfurther fair housing goals, TDHCA changed the 2005 QAP to include the granting of points\n- 14 -\n\nto projects in “high opportunity areas,” and it increased from four to seven the requested\npoints for certain “high opportunity area” categories.12  These changes, along with evidence\nof  other  TDHCA  attempts  to  deconcentrate  LIHTC  projects  in  high-minority  areas,\ndemonstrate that TDHCA did not intentionally discriminate by withholding its discretionary\nauthority to perpetuate a discriminatory impact.  And there are other examples of how\nTDHCA attempted to address the concentration issue, such as the 130% basis boost given\nfor projects in high opportunity areas.  See Ds. Nov. 9, 2011 Br. 23-28 (addressing trial\nevidence regarding several examples).\nICP has failed to prove that TDHCA used the inclusive capture rate13 to intentionally\ndiscriminate by steering developers to propose LIHTC projects in high-minority areas.  The\ninclusive capture rate is not part of the 9% selection criteria, but is instead used during the\nunderwriting process to ensure that projects are financially feasible.14  The inclusive capture\nrate is calculated by comparing the supply of units in a given area to tenant demand for low-\nincome housing in the area.  ICP alleges that the use of the inclusive capture rate leads to\nconcentrations  of  LIHTC  projects  in  high-minority  areas  because  that  is  where  a\n12In response to a complaint to the Governor by Representative Robert Talton that\ngranting seven points for developments in certain high opportunity areas encouraged\ndevelopment in high-income areas rather than low-income areas where the housing was\nneeded, the Governor rejected the 2005 QAP.  After TDHCA lowered the seven point\ncategories to four points, the Governor approved the QAP.\n13TDHCA no longer uses the term “inclusive capture rate.”  It renamed and simplified\nthe formula.\n14A project will not be allocated LIHTC until it passes the underwriting analysis.\n- 15 -\n\ndisproportionate number of low-income housing tenants live; thus if a developer wants to\nincrease the chances of passing the underwriting analysis, it will propose a project in a high-\nminority area.  The court finds that TDHCA uses the inclusive capture rate to measure the\nfinancial feasibility of a proposed development, not to intentionally discriminate based on\nrace.  Financial feasibility is of great concern to TDHCA because LIHTC allocated to\nprojects that fail are largely lost; those lost credits in most instances cannot be allocated to\nother projects.  Thus if a LIHTC project fails, Texas loses low-income housing units that\nwould otherwise have been constructed and available.\nFinally, ICP failed to prove that TDHCA’s justifications for the prima facie showing\nof disparate impact are pretextual.  Again, the court need not explain its reasoning for\nrejecting each of ICP’s arguments.  See supra note 1.  These two are illustrative.\nICP posits that one of TDHCA’s asserted justifications for the disparate impact—that\nTDHCA does not control the locations of LIHTC projects because developers choose\nthem—is pretextual because TDHCA, through the use of the inclusive capture rate, steers\ndevelopers to propose projects in high-minority neighborhoods.  According to ICP, the\ninclusive capture rate has this effect because the rate TDHCA requires for a project to pass\nthe underwriting analysis effectively dictates that a high number of low-income tenants must\nlive in the area of the proposed development.  As the court has already discussed, however,\nTDHCA uses the inclusive capture rate during the underwriting process as a measurement\nof a project’s financial feasibility.  ICP has therefore failed to prove that TDHCA’s\n- 16 -\n\njustification that developers choose the LIHTC sites is pretextual.15\nICP also maintains that TDHCA’s justification that developers choose project sites \nis pretextual because TDHCA uses a less demanding inclusive capture rate for elderly\nprojects, which typically have fewer minority residents, than for non-elderly projects, which\ntypically have more minority residents.  ICP contends that this results in steering only non-\nelderly projects into high-minority areas.  The court finds from the credible evidence,\nhowever, that TDHCA used different rates because, inter alia, the turnover rate in elderly\nunits is much lower than in non-elderly units, thus requiring a lower inclusive capture rate\nto ensure the financial feasibility of the project.  Accordingly, the court finds that TDHCA’s\njustification that developers choose project sites is not pretextual.\nBecause ICP has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that TDHCA \nintentionally discriminates on the basis of race when allocating LIHTC, the court finds that\nit has failed to prove its intentional discrimination claims under the Fourteenth Amendment\n(actionable under § 1983) and § 1982.\n15TDHCA does influence the locations of the LIHTC projects by selecting which\nprojects are awarded LIHTC.  To the extent TDHCA’s contention that developers choose the\nlocation of LIHTC projects is not in all respects precise, this inaccuracy does not belie an\nattempt by TDHCA to conceal discriminatory intent.\n- 17 -\n\nIII\nICP also alleges that defendants are liable under §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the FHA\nbased on a claim for disparate impact.\n A\n“The [FHA] prohibits discrimination in the provision of housing.”  Artisan/Am. Corp.\nv. City of Alvin, Tex., 588 F.3d 291, 295 (5th Cir. 2009).  Section 3604(a) of the FHA makes\nit unlawful, inter alia, to “make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of\nrace[.]”  Section 3605(a) provides that it is unlawful, inter alia, “for any person or other\nentity whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to\ndiscriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or\nconditions of such a transaction, because of race[.]”  A “residential real estate-related\ntransaction” includes providing financial assistance for the construction of a dwelling.  Id. \n§ 3605(b). \nIn ICP II the court held that ICP was entitled to summary judgment establishing that\nit had made a prima facie showing of disparate impact.  See ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 499-\n500.  In particular, the court relied on evidence that, “from 1999–2008, TDHCA approved\ntax credits for 49.7% of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Caucasian areas, but only\napproved 37.4% of proposed non-elderly units in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas.”  Id. at\n499.16  Because ICP has made this showing, the burden has shifted to defendants to prove by\n16The court relied on other evidence as well, including the “Talton Report,” a report\nof the House Committee on Urban Affairs prepared for the House of Representatives, 80th\n- 18 -\n\na preponderance of the evidence that their actions were in furtherance of a legitimate\ngovernmental interest.  See Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d\n926, 939 (2d Cir. 1988) (citing Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 149 (3d Cir.\n1977)), aff’d in part, 488 U.S. 15 (1988); Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.17  To meet this burden,\nTexas Legislature, and a study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \nSee ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 500.\n17The Fifth Circuit has not yet adopted a standard and proof regime for FHA-based\ndisparate impact claims.  The circuits that have done so have adopted at least three different\nstandards and proof regimes.  In ICP II this court essentially followed the approach of the\nSecond Circuit in Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d 926, although, unlike Huntington Branch,\nthe court did not engage in a process of balancing factors identified in Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283 (7th Cir. 1977).  See ICP\nII, 749 F.Supp.2d at 503.  The approach taken in ICP II was consistent with that found in\nother decisions of this court.  See, e.g., AHF Cmty. Dev., LLC v. City of Dallas, 633\nF.Supp.2d 287, 304 (N.D. Tex. 2009) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (“Once the plaintiff has made out a\nprima facie case of discriminatory effect . . . the burden shifts to the defendant to prove a\ncompelling government interest.”) (internal quotation omitted) (citing Dews v. Town of\nSunnyvale, Tex., 109 F.Supp.2d 526, 532 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (Buchmeyer, C.J.)).  \nIt appeared that the Supreme Court might clarify this unsettled area of the law.  After\nthis case was tried, and while the parties were making post-trial submissions, the Court\ngranted certiorari in Gallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d 823 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. granted, 132\nS.Ct. 548 (U.S. Nov. 7, 2011) (No. 10-1032), and cert. dism’d, ___ S.Ct. ____, 2012 WL\n469885 (U.S. Feb. 14, 2012), to decide two questions: “Are disparate impact claims\ncognizable under the Fair Housing Act?” and “If such claims are cognizable, should they be\nanalyzed under the burden shifting approach used by three circuits, under the balancing test\nused by four circuits, under a hybrid approach used by two circuits, or by some other test?” \nPetition for Writ of Certiorari at i, Magner v. Gallagher, 2011 WL 549171 (Feb. 14, 2011)\n(No. 10-1032).  On February 14, 2012 this court entered an order deferring its decision in this\ncase until Magner was decided.  Feb. 14, 2012 Order at 1.  But the Supreme Court dismissed\nthe petition the same day this court entered its order.  Magner v. Gallagher, ___ S.Ct. ____,\n2012 WL 469885 (Feb. 14, 2012). \nAbsent controlling authority of the Supreme Court or the Fifth Circuit, the court will\napply the law of the case, as set out in ICP II, and allocate to defendants the burden of proof\nregarding ICP’s disparate impact claim because ICP has satisfied its burden of establishing\na prima facie case.  The court will not, however, require that defendants prove a compelling\n- 19 -\n\ndefendants must prove two essential elements.  First, they must prove that their interest is\nbona fide and legitimate.  Second, they must prove there are no less discriminatory\nalternatives, meaning that “no alternative course of action could be adopted that would\nenable that interest to be served with less discriminatory impact.”  See Dews v. Town of\nSunnyvale, Tex., 109 F.Supp.2d 526, 565, 568 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (Buchmeyer, C.J.); see also\nHuntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 939; Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  “[In] the end there must be a\nweighing of the adverse impact against the defendant’s justification.”  Huntington Branch,\n844 F.2d at 936; see also Gashi v. Grubb & Ellis Prop. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 801 F.Supp.2d\n12, 16 (D.

See ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 503; see also AHF Cmty. Dev.,\n633 F.Supp.2d at 304 (“Once the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of discriminatory\neffect . . .  the burden shifts to the defendant to prove a compelling government interest.”)\n(internal quotation omitted).  Because defendants maintain that the court should apply a\nlegitimate governmental interest standard absent Fifth Circuit precedent that requires the\nhigher compelling governmental interest, and because the result of today’s case is the same\nunder the legitimate governmental interest standard, the court opts to decide the claim under\nthe lower standard.\n18Some courts balance objectives in order to determine whether a discriminatory\nimpact violates the FHA.  See, e.g., Vill. of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d at 1290 (examining\n“(1) how strong is the plaintiff's showing of discriminatory effect; (2) is there some evidence\nof  discriminatory  intent,  though  not  enough  to  satisfy  the  constitutional  standard  of\nWashington v. Davis; (3) what is the defendant's interest in taking the action complained of;\nand (4) does the plaintiff seek to compel the defendant to affirmatively provide housing for\nmembers of minority groups or merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with\nindividual property owners who wish to provide such housing”).  This court has not adopted\n- 20 -\n\nB\n1\nDefendants assert that they acted in furtherance of a compelling, or at least legitimate,\ngovernmental interest: the awarding of tax credits in an objective, transparent, predictable,\nand race-neutral manner, in accordance with federal and state law.19 Defendants point out that\nthe Texas Legislature, likely in response to the indictment and conviction of a TDHCA board\nthis approach.  See Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 51 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(rejecting balancing approach adopted by Village of Arlington Heights because “we do not\nthink that the courts’ job is to ‘balance’ objectives, with individual judges deciding which\nseem to them more worthy” and “to have federal judges make such policy choices is\nessentially to impose on them the job of making decisions that are properly made by\nCongress or its executive-branch delegates; and the balancing approach is in tension with the\ncourse taken by the Supreme Court and Congress under Title VII where a standard of\njustification is constructed and applied”) (emphasis in original). \n19As one of their asserted interests, defendants contend that they seek to award tax\ncredits in a race-neutral manner.  But a disparate impact claim does not require proof of\ndiscriminatory intent.  See, e.g., Homebuilders Ass’n of Miss. v. City of Brandon, Miss., 640\nF.Supp.2d 835, 841 (S.D. Miss. 2009); Arbor Bend Villas Hous., L.P. v. Tarrant Cnty. Hous.\nFin. Corp., 2005 WL 548104, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 9, 2005) (Means, J.).  And although\nfacially neutral, a policy or practice can still violate the FHA because of its discriminatory\nimpact.  See Homebuilders Ass’n, 640 F.Supp.2d at 841 (“[A] discriminatory effect claim\nchallenges  neutral  policies  that  create  statistical  disparities  which  are  equivalent  to\nintentional discrimination”.); Luckett v. Town of Bentonia, 2007 WL 1673570, at *6 (S.D.\nMiss. June 7, 2007) (“To succeed on [an FHA disparate impact claim], the plaintiff must\nidentify a policy or practice that is facially neutral in its treatment of different groups but that\nin fact falls more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business\nnecessity.”) (citing Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977));\nOwens v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 2005 WL 1837959, at *13 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 2, 2005)\n(Sanders, J.)

According to TDHCA, these amendments\nwere adopted for the purpose of creating an objective and transparent system, and TDHCA\nacts with these goals in mind.  Although defendants rely principally on the foregoing\ninterests, they also posit that the public interest is served by ensuring that tax credits are\nawarded to developments that will provide quality, sustainable housing for low-income\nindividuals, and by providing the public an opportunity to participate in creating the QAP in\nan open and transparent manner, thereby enabling the LIHTC program to represent different\npolicy viewpoints, in compliance with public expectations.\nDefendants also maintain that, because of the strict requirements of federal and state\nlaw, TDHCA has only limited discretion, found in its ability (1) to modify strictly the below-\nthe-line criteria, and not the statutory above-the-line criteria, and (2) to “forward commit”\nby awarding tax credits from the following year’s allocation of tax credits to a 9% tax credit\napplication that would not otherwise succeed due to its low score under the selection\ncriteria.20  According to defendants, forward commitments have been used sparingly, with\n20To the extent defendants are arguing that their discretion is limited because they do\nnot select the location of their projects, defendants are misconstruing the issue in this case. \nAs the court noted in ICP II, “ICP does not complain of the distribution of low-income\nhousing in general; ICP challenges the allegedly discriminatory actions of TDHCA in\ndisproportionately  denying  tax  credits  to  proposed  developments  in  Caucasian\nneighborhoods.  TDHCA does control the approval or denial of applications actually\nsubmitted.”  ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 496.\n- 22 -\n\nonly three made in 2003 to 2007 in the region that includes Dallas.  Defendants also maintain\nthat this discretion cannot be used in a manner that subverts federal and state law; otherwise,\nit would render meaningless the intent of the Legislature in creating an objective, transparent,\nand predictable system.\nDefendants also note TDHCA’s actions in response to the Housing and Economic\nRecovery Act of 2008 (“HERA”).  Before the enactment of HERA, states were limited to\nawarding 30% basis boosts only to developments located in qualified census tracts or\ndifficult  development  areas.    But  after  HERA,  states  were  permitted  to  choose  the\ndevelopments to receive the boost.  TDHCA exercised this authority in the 2009 QAP to\ntarget developments in “high opportunity areas.”  A “high opportunity area” is defined as:\nan area that includes:\n(A) existing major bus transfer centers and/or regional or local\ncommuter rail transportation stations that are accessible to all\nresidents including Persons with Disabilities; or\n(B) a census tract which has an [Area Median Gross Income\n(“AMGI”)] that is higher than the AMGI of the county or place\nin which the census tract is located; or\n(C) a school attendance zone that has an academic rating of\n“Exemplary” or “Recognized” rating (as determined by the\nTexas Education Agency) as of the first day of the Application\nSubmission Acceptance Period; or\n(D)  a  census  tract  that  has  no  greater  than  10%  poverty\npopulation according to the most recent census data (these\ncensus tracts are designated in the 2010 Housing Tax Credit Site\nDemographic Characteristics Report).\nP. Ex. 127 at 6-7.  Defendants suggest that this change “is likely to have a positive effect in\nincreasing the number of LIHTC developments in [high opportunity areas].”  See Ds. Dec.\n21, 2011 Reply Br. 3.\n- 23 -\n\nIn addressing the second prong—which requires proof of no less discriminatory\nalternatives—defendants assert that “[t]here is no alternative that would serve the interest[s]\nwith less discriminatory effect than the racially-neutral objective scoring system that is now\nin effect (and has been since 2003).”  Ds. Dec. 21, 2011 Reply Br. 6.  They criticize ICP’s\nrequested relief of establishing a set-aside for projects in high opportunity areas, suggesting\nthat this remedy cannot qualify as a less discriminatory alternative because it would conflict\nwith governing law and contravene Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S.\n265 (1978).\nDefendants next compare the justification against the resulting harm.  They assert that \nICP’s claim of injury is diminished by evidence that over 5,600 affordable, Section 8 housing\nunits, although not necessarily LIHTC units, are available; a significant number of LIHTC\nunits  are  located  in  Walker  Target  Area  Tracts;21  developments  in  high  opportunity\nneighborhoods have suffered high vacancy rates, such as 9.5% and 14.28%; and if the court\nwere to broaden its comparison of approval rates from 0% to 9.9% and 90% to 100%\nCaucasian areas, as relied upon in its summary judgment opinion, see ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d\nat 499-500, it would better illustrate the alleged impact, since TDHCA approved tax credits\nfor 42.5% of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 19.9% Caucasian areas and 50.0% for 80%\n21The term “Walker Target Area Tracts” is defined in the Settlement Stipulation and\nOrder in Walker v. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, No. 3:85-CV-\n1210-R, at 4 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 8, 2001) (Buchmeyer, C.J.). A qualifying census tract\n“according to the most recent decennial census, (i) has a black population at or below the\naverage black population of the City of Dallas, (ii) has no public housing, and (iii) has a\npoverty rate at or below the average for the City of Dallas.”  Id.\n- 24 -\n\nto 100% Caucasian areas, and approved tax credits for 39.8% of the 0% to 29.9% and 48.6%\nfor 70% to 100% Caucasian areas.  Thus they argue that the harm to ICP cannot outweigh\nthe substantial interests served by TDHCA. \n2\nICP contends that defendants are presenting only interests that are furthered by the\napplication of the Texas Legislature’s mandatory statutory requirements, in particular the\nselection criteria that apply only to the 9% tax credits.  It asserts that the action that must be\njustified is the disproportionate approval of tax credits for non-elderly developments in\nminority neighborhoods, the issue giving rise to the FHA discriminatory impact claim.  ICP\nalso posits that the Texas Legislature’s mandatory selection criteria cannot be the cause of\nthe  discriminatory  impact  because  the  impact  did  not  significantly  increase  after  the\nimplementation of the framework in 2003, and the 4% tax credits, which are not subject to\nthe mandatory selection criteria, nonetheless contribute to the discriminatory impact.  Last,\nICP argues that defendants have not presented evidence regarding whether there are less\ndiscriminatory alternatives and, therefore, have failed to satisfy their burden.\nC\nThe court will assume that defendants’ proffered interests are bona fide and legitimate. \nSee Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 939 (deciding to consider second prong first “[f]or\nanalytical ease”).  The court will therefore focus on whether defendants have met their\nburden of proving the second of the two essential elements: that there are no other less\ndiscriminatory alternatives to advancing their proffered interests, i.e., that “no alternative\n- 25 -\n\ncourse of action could be adopted that would enable that interest to be served with less\ndiscriminatory impact.”  Dews, 109 F.Supp.2d at 532.\nDefendants have not presented arguments regarding the second element.  Instead, they\nrely on the conclusory assertion that “[t]here is no alternative that would serve the interest[s]\nwith less discriminatory effect.”  Ds. Dec. 21, 2011 Reply Br. 6.  They then criticize ICP’s\nrequested set-aside remedy.  But even assuming that defendants’ criticism of this remedy is\ncorrect, the fact that one possible alternative course of action is not viable does not prove that\nthere are no other less discriminatory alternatives that could be adopted that would enable\nthe interest to be served with less discriminatory impact.  \nDefendants have also failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\nallocating tax credits in a nondiscriminatory and nonsegregative manner would impair any\nof the asserted interests.  Cf. Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 940 (noting that two of town’s\nreasons for refusing to rezone plaintiff’s site were that it was inconsistent with defendant’s\nhousing assistance plan and zoning ordinance, and rejecting these interests because the town\nsimply relied on the existence of the plan and zoning ordinance without presenting evidence\nindicating why building the project would impair the interests sought to be advanced by the\nplan and zoning ordinance).  Nor is there a basis for finding that TDHCA cannot allocate\nLIHTC in a manner that is objective, predictable, and transparent, follows federal and state\nlaw, and furthers the public interest, without disproportionately approving LIHTC in\npredominantly  minority  neighborhoods  and  disproportionately  denying  LIHTC  in\n- 26 -\n\npredominantly Caucasian neighborhoods.22 \nTDHCA also retains certain limited types of discretion that can be relied on to address\nthe discriminatory impact.  Defendants have not proved that, in using this discretion,\nTDHCA  has  adopted  the  least  discriminatory  alternative  to  further  the  legitimate\ngovernmental interest.  Regarding the selection criteria of each QAP, which applies only to\nthe 9% tax credits, defendants maintain that TDHCA has discretion only in modifying below-\nthe-line criteria.  They posit that this discretion is limited in that the points accorded to\nbelow-the-line criteria cannot exceed the lowest-ranked statutory above-the-line criterion,\nand the Governor must approve of the QAP.  Although TDHCA contends that it has added\ncertain below-the-line criteria with the purpose of affirmatively furthering fair housing goals\n(e.g., providing a score enhancement for projects located in a “high opportunity area,” see\nDs. Nov. 9, 2011 Br. 25), defendants have not proved that these criteria are the least\ndiscriminatory alternatives, and that TDHCA cannot add other below-the-line criteria that\nwill effectively reduce the discriminatory impact while still furthering its interests.23  For\n22Similarly, at the summary judgment stage, the court held in ICP II that defendants’\nproffered compelling governmental interest—adherence to I.R.C. § 42—was insufficient\nbecause “[d]efendants . . . failed to establish that TDHCA cannot comply with § 42 in a way\nthat has less discriminatory impact on the community” and that “TDHCA cannot comply\nwith both § 42 and the FHA.”  ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 504.\n23The “Talton Report,” a report of the House Committee on Urban Affairs prepared\nfor the House of Representatives, 80th Texas Legislature, also concluded that TDHCA and\nthe BRB“disproportionately allocate federal [LIHTC] funds and the tax-exempt bond funds\nto developments located in impacted areas (above average minority concentration and below\naverage income levels)” and similarly recommended that TDHCA, BRB, and the legislature,\namong other things, “consider adding provisions to the QAP and the bond rules that give\n- 27 -\n\nexample, in the 2010 QAP, an application could receive four points under the “Development\nLocation” below-the-line criterion if its proposed development site was located within one\nof six geographical areas: (1) “an Economically Distressed Area; a Colonia; or a Difficult\nDevelopment Area”;24 (2) a county that has received an award within the last three years\nsignificant point scoring and/or set-aside of credits for affirmatively furthering assimilation\noutside of impacted areas.”  P. Ex. 1 at 48-49.  \n24An “Economically Distressed Area” is defined as:\nan Area in which:\n(A) Water supply or sewer services are inadequate to meet\nminimal needs of residential users as defined by Texas Water\nDevelopment Board rules;\n(B) Financial resources are inadequate to provide water supply\nor sewer services that will satisfy those needs; and\n(C) An established residential subdivision was located on June\n1, 1989, as determined by the Texas Water Development Board.\nP. Ex. 127 at 6.  A “Colonia” is defined as:\nA geographic Area that is located in a county some part of\nwhich is within 150 miles of the international border of this\nstate, that consists of 11 or more dwellings that are located in\nclose proximity to each other in an area that may be described\nas a community or neighborhood, and that: (§2306.581)\n(A) Has a majority population composed of individuals and\nfamilies of low-income and very low income, based on the\nfederal Office of Management and Budget poverty index, and\nmeets the qualifications of an economically distressed Area\nunder §17.921, Texas Water Code; or\n(B) Has the physical and economic characteristics of a colonia,\nas determined by the Department.\nId. at 5.

Ex. 127 at 52-53.  In other words, the “Development Location” criterion\nis a “menu option” where an applicant need only fulfill one of the six to receive the four\npoints; fulfilling more than one would still result in four points.  Thus even assuming that the\nthird, fourth, and fifth options could reduce the asserted discriminatory impact, as suggested\n25An “Urban Core” is defined as\n[a] compact and contiguous geographical area that is located in\na Metropolitan Statistical Area within the city limits of a city\nwith a population of no less than 150,000 composed of adjacent\nblock groups in which at least 90% of the land not in public\nownership is zoned to accommodate a mix of medium or high\ndensity residential and commercial uses and at least 50% of such\nland is actually being used for such purposes based on high\ndensity  residential  structures  and/or  commercial  structures\nalready constructed.\nP. Ex. 127 at 12.\n- 29 -\n\nby defendants,26 an applicant could instead opt for the first one, which covers “Economically\nDistressed” locations and could further exacerbate the discriminatory impact.  Further, even\nif an applicant satisfied the third, fourth, or fifth option, it could receive four points at most\nbecause the QAP does not permit the award of four points for each option.  Similar to how\nTDHCA made the below-the-line criterion “Developments in Census Tracts with No Other\nExisting Same Type Developments Supported by Tax Credits” its own criterion worth six\npoints, TDHCA can further reduce the discriminatory impact by converting the types of\ndevelopment locations suggested to reduce the discriminatory impact into its own scoring\nitems.27  \nMoreover, although defendants maintain that TDHCA’s discretion in creating the\nselection criteria is limited to adopting below-the-line criteria, it appears that this discretion\nis actually broader.  It appears to extend to the authority to choose the number of points to\n26This  is  based  on  defendants’  underlying  assumption  that  “there’s  a  known\nassociation between race and income and poverty levels in Texas,” as Mary Whiteside, Ph.D. \ntestified at trial and stated in her initial and second reports.  See, e.g., Tr. 2:161; Ds. Ex. 224\nat 1-4; Ds. Ex. 225 at 4.  ICP raised numerous objections against the use of her testimony and\nreports.  See, e.g., P. Nov. 9, 2011 at 20-22; Tr. 2:162.  Because the court relies on her\ntestimony and expert reports to support ICP’s disparate impact claim (i.e., to suggest that the\nevidence supports the existence of less discriminatory alternatives), it need not resolve ICP’s\nobjections before relying on this evidence in this context.  \n27To  the  extent  defendants  argue  that  TDHCA’s  discretion  in  reducing  the\ndiscriminatory impact is restricted by the requirement of gubernatorial approval of QAP\nchanges, and they rely on a specific instance when the Governor in fact rejected a QAP\nchange, there is no evidence that the Governor would decline to approve a change necessary\nfor TDHCA to comply with a federal court order directing defendants to remedy a violation\nof the FHA.\n- 30 -\n\nbe accorded each above- and below-the-line criterion, so long as the priority of statutory\nabove-the-line criteria is maintained and the Governor approves.  This suggests that TDHCA\ncan accord more points to below-the-line criteria that reduce the discriminatory impact, as\nlong as the points do not exceed the lowest above-the-line criterion, while still furthering\nTDHCA’s interests.  For example, given that the lowest above-the-line criterion, “Declared\nDisaster Areas,” was worth seven points in the 2010 QAP, below-the-line critiera that\nassisted in reducing the discriminatory impact could have been allotted six points while\nrespecting the priority of the statutory above-the-line criteria.  A proposed development that\nfalls within the guidelines of one of the “Development Location[s]” that could reduce the\ndiscriminatory impact is worth only four points.  See P. Ex. 127 at 52-53.  In comparison, the\n“Community Revitalization” below-the-line criterion awards six points.  See id. at 51.  To\nsatisfy the “Community Revitalization” criterion, the proposed development must “use . . .\nan  Existing  Residential  Development”  and  “propose[]  any  Rehabilitation  or  any\nReconstruction  that  is  part  of  a  Community  Revitalization  Plan.”    Id.    Because\n“Rehabilitation, (which includes reconstruction) or Adaptive Reuse” serves as its own below-\nthe-line criterion separate from the “Community Revitalization” criterion and is worth three\npoints, an applicant fulfilling the “Community Revitalization” criterion appears to be eligible\nfor a total of nine points.  See id.  Given the trial evidence of the connection between race\nand income, communities seeking revitalization are potentially high-minority areas.  Thus\nthe criteria “Community Revitalization” and “Rehabilitation (which includes reconstruction)\nor  Adaptive  Reuse”  may  exacerbate  the  discriminatory  impact,  especially  since  the\n- 31 -\n\n“Development Location” criterion is only worth four points and barely offsets nine points.\nAdditionally, despite questioning from ICP concerning how more points could be allocated\nto above-the-line statutory criteria so that below-the-line criteria (in particular, criteria that\nwould reduce the discriminatory impact) could also be given more points and result in greater\nweight in comparison to total points available, defendants do not address this area of\ndiscretion.  Thus defendants have failed to prove that TDHCA has adopted the least\ndiscriminatory alternative that will still advance its interests. \nDefendants have also failed to prove that forward commitments could not have been\nused  in  a  less  discriminatory  manner  while  still  advancing  TDHCA’s  legitimate\ngovernmental interests.28  Defendants contend that forward commitments are sparingly used\nand suggest that this is so because TDHCA must be careful not to use them in a way that\nwould thwart legislative intent that the system be objective, transparent, and predictable.  The\nfact that this authority is granted to TDHCA and that it has used it in certain circumstances\nsuggests that it can be applied while still advancing TDHCA’s interests.  And even if it is\nsparingly used, this does not address the disputed issue whether forward commitments have\nbeen used in the least discriminatory manner.  For example, Fairway Crossing, one of the\nthree applications that defendants state received a forward commitment from 2003 to 2007,\n28Defendants maintain that Governor Rick Perry (“Governor Perry”) modified the\n2012 QAP to eliminate forward commitments.  Assuming arguendo that this is true,\ndefendants have still failed to prove that, during the time when forward commitments were\navailable, TDHCA approved them in the least discriminatory manner, while still advancing\nits proffered interests.\n- 32 -\n\nis alleged by ICP to be located in a 0% to 9.9% Caucasian area.  See P. Ex. 157 at 3. \nAlthough defendants assert that “[t]his project scored high enough to be awarded credits,”\nsee Ds. Nov. 9, 2011 Br. at 10 n.8, it is not necessary for the development to score well under\nthe selection criteria for it to be awarded a forward commitment.  And it remains unclear\nwhether a forward commitment to another application that year could have reduced the\ndiscriminatory impact while advancing TDHCA’s interests. \nAlthough TDHCA selected “high opportunity areas” to be the recipient of the 30%\nbasis boost, the definition of “high opportunity areas” suggests that further steps can be taken\nto reduce the discriminatory impact while still promoting TDHCA’s legitimate governmental\ninterests.  A high opportunity area includes an area that has a major bus or rail station, a\ncensus tract with a higher AMGI than the tract’s county or place, a school attendance zone\nwith an academic rating of “Exemplary” or “Recognized,” or a census tract with no greater\nthan 10% poverty rate.  See P. Ex. 127 at 6-7.  As an example, were TDHCA to require an\napplicant to meet all four criteria rather than just one to receive a basis boost, this would\nappear to reduce the discriminatory impact.\nTDHCA also has discretion under at least one QAP that can be used to reduce the\ndiscriminatory impact of LIHTC.  Section 50.10(a)(2) of the 2008 QAP authorized TDHCA,\nin considering staff recommendations for both 4% and 9% tax credits, to “not rely solely on\nthe number of points scored by an Application” under the QAP and to “take into account, as\nit deem[ed] appropriate,” certain listed discretionary factors, including location, proximity\nto other low-income housing developments, and other good causes as determined by\n- 33 -\n\nTDHCA.29  See P. Ex. 125 at 60-61; Ds. Ex. 14 at 60-61; see also Tr. 2:10, 12.30  This\n29It is unclear whether Governor Perry eliminated this authority in the 2012 QAP.  See\nDs. Dec. 7, 2011 Br. 6-7 (noting that Governor Perry eliminated TDHCA’s ability to “waive\ninternal rules,” without clarifying which internal rules). Even assuming that Governor Perry\neliminated this area of discretion, the court concludes, at it does supra at note 28, that\ndefendants have failed to prove that TDHCA used this discretion, when it was available, in\nthe least discriminatory manner, while still advancing its proffered interests.\n30Section 55.10(a)(2) of the 2008 QAP provided, in relevant part: \nIn making a determination to allocate tax credits, the Board shall\nbe authorized to not rely solely on the number of points scored\nby an Application. It shall in addition, be entitled to take into\naccount, as it deems appropriate, the discretionary factors listed\nin this paragraph. . . . If the Board disapproves or fails to act\nupon an Application, the Department shall issue to the Applicant\na written notice stating the reason(s) for the Board's disapproval\nor failure to act. In making tax credit decisions . . . , the Board,\nin its discretion, may evaluate, consider and apply any one or\nmore of the following discretionary factors: . . . \n(A) The Developer market study;\n(B) The location;\n(C) The compliance history of the Developer;\n(D) The financial feasibility;\n(E)  The  appropriateness  of  the  Development’s  size  and\nconfiguration in relation to the housing needs of the community\nin which the Development is located;\n(F) The Development’s proximity to other low-income housing\nDevelopments;\n(G) The availability of adequate public facilities and services;\n(H) The anticipated impact on local school districts;\n(I) Zoning and other land use considerations;\n(J) Any matter considered by the Board to be relevant to the\napproval  decision  and  in  furtherance  of  the  Department’s\npurposes; and\n(K) Other good cause as determined by the Board.\nP. Ex. 125 at 60-61; Ds. Ex. 14 at 60-61.\n- 34 -\n\nsuggests that, despite an application’s score under the selection critiera, TDHCA was \nauthorized  under  the  2008  QAP  to  take  into  account  factors  such  as  “location”  of\ndevelopments or “other good causes” in the award of tax credits.  Because defendants have\nnot addressed whether TDHCA used the least discriminatory means while still furthering its\ninterests in exercising this discretion, the question remains whether it has been used in a\nmanner that would reduce the discriminatory impact.31  \nAccordingly, because defendants have failed to meet their burden of proving that there\nare no less discriminatory alternatives, meaning that no alternative course of action could be\nadopted that would enable TDHCA’s interest to be served with less discriminatory impact, \nthe court finds in favor of ICP on its discriminatory impact claim under the FHA.\n31Although ICP contends that the allocation of 4% tax credits also results in a\ndiscriminatory impact, defendants do not address whether TDHCA has adopted the least \ndiscriminatory alternative to further its legitimate governmental interests as to the 4% tax\ncredits.  Defendants stress their limited discretion in changing the mandatory selection when\nthe 4% tax credits are not bound to scoring under that criteria.  Four percent tax credits are\nnon-competitive and reviewed solely for “threshold, eligibility, and then . . . underwrit[ing],”\nP. Ex. 1 at 20.  And unlike the mandatory selection criteria, it does not appear that the Texas\nGovernment Code similarly limits TDHCA’s discretion in choosing the threshold criteria. \nCf. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6702(a)(15) (West 2003) (defining “Threshold criteria” as\n“criteria  used  to  determine  whether  the  development  satisfies  the  minimum  level  of\nacceptability for consideration established in the department's qualified allocation plan”); \nid. at § 2306.6710(a) (requiring TDHCA to “determine whether the application satisfies the\nthreshold criteria required by the board in the qualified allocation plan”).  This leaves\nTDHCA greater discretion in adding criteria that could reduce the discriminatory impact. \n- 35 -\n\n IV\nThe court considers next defendants’ contention that ICP’s FHA claim is barred by\nthe statute of limitations.\nA complaint under the FHA is timely when it is filed within two years after the\noccurrence or termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice.  See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3613(a)(1)(A).  If a plaintiff challenges “an unlawful practice that continues into the\nlimitations period, the complaint is timely if filed within [two years] of the last asserted\noccurrence of that practice.”  Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 380-81 (1982)\n(emphasis added); § 3613(a)(1)(A); see also Pecan Acres Ltd. P’ship I v. City of Lake\nCharles, 54 Fed. Appx. 592, 2002 WL 31730433, at *1 (5th Cir. 2002) (per curiam).  \nICP’s FHA claim is founded on an unlawful practice: TDHCA’s disproportionate\napproval of tax credits for non-elderly developments in minority neighborhoods, and,\nconversely,  its  disproportionate  denial  of  tax  credits  for  non-elderly  housing  in\npredominantly Caucasian neighborhoods.  ICP has presented evidence from 1999 to 2008\nto support this unlawful practice.  Thus even assuming that the violation terminated in 2008,\nit is clear that ICP’s lawsuit was timely filed on March 28, 2008.  Defendants have failed to\nprove their limitations defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\nV\nFinally, TDHCA relies on the affirmative defense of Eleventh Amendment immunity. \nTDHCA asserts that it is an arm of the State of Texas and is therefore entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.\n- 36 -\n\nTDHCA bears the burden of proving that it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity.  See Skelton v. Camp, 234 F.3d 292, 297-98 (5th Cir. 2000).  Such immunity is\nproper if “a suit is really against the state itself.”  Id. at 297 (citing Laje v. R.E. Thomason\nGen. Hosp., 665 F.2d 724, 727 (5th Cir. 1982)).  To make this determination courts weigh\nnumerous factors, such as: \n(1) whether state statutes and case law characterize the agency\nas an arm of the state; (2) the source of funds for the entity; (3)\nthe degree of local autonomy the entity enjoys; (4) whether the\nentity is concerned primarily with local, as opposed to statewide,\nproblems; (5) whether the entity has authority to sue and be sued\nin its own name; and (6) whether the entity has the right to hold\nand use property.\nVogt v. Bd. of Comm’rs Orleans Levee Dist., 294 F.3d 684, 689 (5th Cir. 2002) (citations\nomitted).  “The most significant factor in assessing an entity’s status is whether a judgment\nagainst it will be paid with state funds.”  Id. (brackets and citations omitted).\nThe Fifth Circuit has previously held that a predecessor agency of TDHCA—the\nTexas Housing Agency—is not an arm of the state.  See Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs\nv. Verex Assur., Inc., 68 F.3d 922, 926-28 (5th Cir. 1995), overruled on other grounds by\nMullins v. TestAmerica, Inc., 564 F.3d 386, 413 n.19 (5th Cir. 2009).32  TDHCA does not\nspecifically address any of the Vogt factors or argue that the factors relied upon in Verex\nshould be assessed differently.  Thus much of the analysis in Verex is uncontested.  For\n32Although the analysis in Vogt and Verex is not identical, the Fifth Circuit relies on\nmany of the same factors when determining whether an agency is an arm of the state for the\npurposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Compare Vogt, 294 F.3d at 692-96 with Verex,\n68 F.3d at 926-28.\n- 37 -\n\nexample, TDHCA can sue and be sued in its own name, see Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.\n§ 2306.053(b), has the right to hold and use property, see § 2306.174, and is funded primarily\nby the federal government and by borrowing private capital that is not debt against the State\nof Texas, see P. Ex. 162 at 78-83; P. Ex. 381 at 13.  Moreover, TDHCA’s funds, excluding\nappropriations for the Texas Legislature, are maintained outside of the state treasury.  See\nTex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.071.  Even though two factors weigh in TDHCA’s favor\n(TDHCA is concerned with statewide problems rather than local problems and does not have\nlocal autonomy), the court finds that these factors do not outweigh the ones that favor finding\nthat TDHCA is not an arm of the state.  See Verex, 68 F.3d at 928 (holding that even though\nTexas Housing Agency was concerned with statewide rather than local issues, it was not an\narm of the state).  The court therefore finds that TDHCA has not met its burden of proving\nthat it is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nVI\nAs ICP recognizes in the Pretrial Order, it is appropriate to afford TDHCA an\nopportunity to present a plan to remedy its violation of the FHA.  Accordingly, TDHCA must\nsubmit a remedial plan that sets out how it will bring its allocation decisions into compliance\nwith the FHA.  This remedial plan need be no “more intrusive than is necessary to remedy\nproved  [FHA]  violations.”    Rizzo,  564  F.2d  at  149  (holding  that  Supreme  Court’s\nadmonitions that federal equitable belief be carefully tailored to proven constitutional\nviolations is “no less forceful” when applied to statutory violations).  The court encourages\nthe parties to work cooperatively in formulating a remedial plan so that as many potential\n- 38 -\n\nobjections  as  possible  can  be  resolved  before  the  plan  is  submitted  to  the  court  for\nconsideration and approval. \n*     *     *\nFor the reasons explained, the court finds in favor of ICP on its disparate impact claim\nunder the FHA and otherwise finds in favor of defendants.  Within 60 days of the date this\nmemorandum opinion and order is filed, defendants must file their remedial plan.  ICP may\nsubmit objections within 30 days after the remedial plan is filed.  If objections are filed, the\ncourt will establish any necessary additional procedures by separate order.\nSO ORDERED.\nMarch 20, 2012.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

The parties\nthereafter tried the balance of the case in a bench trial.  In a memorandum opinion and order filed\nMarch 20, 2012, the court found in favor of ICP on its disparate impact claim under §§ 3604(a) and\n3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), and in favor of defendants on all other claims.  In a\nmemorandum opinion and order filed August 7, 2012, the court adopted a remedial plan for\naddressing the FHA violation.  The court also filed a judgment on August 7, 2012.  In a\nmemorandum opinion and order filed today, the court grants in part and denies in part defendants’\nmotion to alter or amend judgment or, alternatively, for new trial.\nFor the reasons set out in the memorandum opinions and orders filed September 28, 2010,\nMarch 20, 2012, August 7, 2012, and today, it is ordered and adjudged as follows:\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 2 of 28   PageID 7846\nII\nAs used in this amended judgment (hereafter “judgment”), the terms “TDHCA” and\n“defendants” mean, collectively, defendants Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs\nand its Executive Director and board members in their official capacities.  The term “Plan” means\nTDHCA’s proposed remedial plan, attached to this judgment as Exhibit A.  The term “QAP” means\nthe Qualified Allocation Plan adopted by TDHCA under I.R.C. § 42(m)(1)(B), and Tex. Gov’t Code\nAnn. § 2306.6702(a)(10) (West 2011).

Certain  clarifying  remarks  are \nprovided to explain to the Court and to the Plaintiff why certain propounded ways to provide \nremedial measures are not being offered in this Plan.  To the extent that some of these clarifying \nremarks relate to matters of public record which occurred after the closing of the record in these \nproceedings,  Defendant  Texas  Department  of  Housing  and  Community  Affairs  (the \n“Department”) is prepared to offer such support by way of affidavits of fact or sworn testimony \nas the Court may deem necessary.  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 1 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 6 of 28   PageID 7850\nIntroduction and Background \nWhen the Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP) for 2012 (the “2012 QAP”) was submitted to \nGovernor Perry to approve, reject, or modify and approve in accordance with Tex. Gov’t. Code, \n§2306.6724(b),  Governor  Perry  approved  the  2012  QAP  with  modifications.    Those \nmodifications clearly limited the use of discretion by the Department’s Governing Board by \ncurtailing the ability of the Department to make awards of forward commitments of low income \nhousing tax credits (LIHTCs) and by narrowing the conditions under which that Governing \nBoard could approve waivers under the 2012 QAP.  That signal was consistent with the limited \ndiscretion provided by statute, as confirmed by opinions issued by the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral.  Thus, with regard to the proposal of this Plan, Department staff has endeavored to \nstructure a proposal that strives to create a legally-supportable framework in which future QAPs \ncan achieve the objectives of race neutral dispersion of LIHTC assisted developments within the \nremedial plan area by fashioning clear requirements, which are reasonably calculated to yield the \nintended result.  Because this is a process with numerous variables, not least of which is the \ncomplex decision-making process that developers undergo in selecting their proposed sites, this \nPlan will require annual analysis and, as needed, recalibration.   \nIn addition to the limitations on discretion in the 2012 QAP, that rule took a new and \nsignificant policy direction towards the development and  intended successful implementation of \nmeasures  to    generate  a  greater  level  of  tax  credit-assisted  development  activity  in  high \nopportunity areas.  The results to date of these strong actions, actions already taken that set the \nstage for significant high opportunity activity in the area covered by these proceedings, are \npublicly  available.    On  the  Department’s  website  the  current  status  report  of  the  2012 \ncompetitive 9% tax credit round shows that a significant number of competitive applications in \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 2 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 7 of 28   PageID 7851\nhigh opportunity areas have been submitted in Urban Region 3 with 16 of the applications \nlocated in such areas, many of which indicate they are  top scoring applications.   \nThe graphic below shows compellingly that actions already taken by the Department \nhave  materially  changed  the  overall  character  of  the  competitive  LIHTC  round  in  2012, \npromoting overwhelming interest in high opportunity areas.   \n \nIn applicant-initiated appeals and requests for waivers the Board has taken seriously the \nlimitations placed on its discretion and deliberated extensively in publicly conducted, transcribed \nmeetings, leading to results that have closely followed the 2012 QAP.  The Board has considered \nwaivers only in truly exceptional and compelling circumstances where failure to grant the waiver \nwould result in a clear failure to make the opportunity to compete available throughout the state.  \nIt  is  the  Department’s  belief  that  this  proposed  Remedial  Plan  offers  meaningful \nimprovements on the path already forged in the 2012 QAP and creates concepts which, if \nsuccessful, can nurture and reinforce future QAPs.  The Plan embraces the notion of providing \nmaximum permissible incentives for areas that truly reflect the greatest opportunity, namely \nthose areas with the highest income, lowest poverty, and best public education opportunities.   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 3 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 8 of 28   PageID 7852\nAs set forth more fully in §12, captioned “Plan subject to statutory constraints,” the \nDepartment  operates  under  several  layers  of  complex  legal  requirements,  including  the \ncongressional  statement  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §42(m)  that  the  Department  must  give \npreference to “projects which are located in qualified census tracts (as defined in subsection \n(d)(5)(C)) and the development of which contributes to a concerted community revitalization \nplan…”.  Furthermore, the statutory schema for scoring of LIHTC competitive applications \nunder QAPs is driven largely by TEX. GOV’T. CODE, §2306.6710, which has not been questioned \nin these proceedings and, presumably, must be adhered to in developing and administering future \nQAPs.  Two of the key remedial tools proffered by the Plaintiff are the use of discretion, as \ndiscussed above, and the creation of set-asides.  With respect to set-asides, it is open to question \nwhether there is statutory authority for the Department to create set-asides in addition to those set \nforth  in  TEX.  GOV’T.  CODE,  Chapter  2306.    Even  if,  arguendo,  creating  set-asides  were \nauthorized, the suggestion to create a set-aside in the remedial area is problematic because that \narea is but a portion of a larger region pursuant to statute and to which the Department must \nregionally allocate LIHTCs.   \nAs a result of these limitations and premises, the Department is proposing a Plan which \nfocuses on: (1) according proposed developments located in defined high opportunity areas the \ngreatest incentives allowed by state law; and, (2) according developments in Qualified Census \nTracts (QCTs) that are part of true concerted revitalization plans co-equal incentives in order to \nprovide the preference created by Internal Revenue Code §42(m).  It is envisioned that the \nrevitalization incentive will set a very high threshold, making it unlikely to yield a number of \nsuccessful applicants in QCTs such that would perpetuate any discriminatory patterns found to \nhave occurred unintentionally.   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 4 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 9 of 28   PageID 7853\nPlaintiff  has  requested  that  4%  non-competitive  LIHTCs  be  addressed  in  this  plan.   \nBecause of restrictions of federal law, states do not have the ability to designate the 130% basis \nboost for 4% LIHTC’s, and therefore the only 4% LIHTC’s eligible for the 130% basis boost are \ndevelopments in federally designated QCTs and difficult to develop areas (DDAs).  \nThe development and implementation of this Plan and the development of future QAPs in \naccordance with this Plan will be a matter to which the Department, in collaboration with \nPlaintiff, the Department’s oversight bodies, and the public, will continue to work to develop \nmore nuanced and effective ideas to achieve an optimal dispersion of LIHTC developments.  In \ndeveloping this remedial plan for the subject Dallas metro area, the Department intends to apply \nsome of these concepts, or similar concepts to the remainder of the state; however, certain other \nregions will need specifically tailored plans due to differing demographics and other factors. \n1.  Use of discretion - waivers.  \nIn approving the 2012 QAP, Governor Perry determined that the continuation of the \nability to make awards of forward commitments was not desirable and that in exercising its \ndiscretion to waive any aspect of the QAP the Board should only grant waivers when doing so \nwas necessary to further a purpose or policy enunciated in Tex. Gov’t. Code, Chapter 2306.  \n2.  Strengthened definition of a High Opportunity Area (HOA). \nIn the development of its 2012 QAP, the Department adopted a strengthened definition of \na high opportunity area; and, under the scoring criterion of development location, provided 4 \ncompetitive points for a development proposing a location in a HOA.  In order to qualify as \nbeing in an HOA, a development must be in a census tract that has BOTH a low incidence of \npoverty AND an above median income as well as being located in an area served by either \nrecognized  elementary  schools  or  having  a  significant  and  accessible  element  of  public \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 5 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 10 of 28   PageID 7854\ntransportation.  The  Department  currently  anticipates  that  the  highest  four  scoring  2012 \napplications in Urban Region 3 are located within the 5 county remedial area, are located in \nHOAs,  and  are  within  the  attendance  zones  of  recognized  or  exemplary  rated  elementary \nschools.  The Department further anticipates awards in Urban Region 3 will be limited to no \nmore than 6 applications due to the amount of 9% credits available for allocation. \nIn future QAPs, the Department is committed to continuing to strengthen the criteria for \nlocating developments within HOAs. The Department will create a new “Opportunity Index” in \norder  to  incentivize  applications  to  locate  developments  in  the  highest  income  and  lowest \npoverty areas of the remedial area. At the same time, applicants that propose projects in areas of \nhigh opportunity that do not meet the most stringent criteria will still be incentivized, albeit to a \nlesser degree. The proposed Opportunity Index is reflected in the following chart. The highest \n“below the line” (scoring items ranking lower than statutorily required scoring items) point value \nwill be assigned to the highest category within the Opportunity Index (actual point values may \nchange commensurate with changes in the above the line statutory scoring criteria). \nPoints  Population  Poverty Factor  Income Factor  School Quality \nServed  Factor \n7 Points  General use  <15% rate for all  Tract in top quartile of  “Exemplary” or \nindividuals  median household income  “Recognized” \nfor county or, for site in an  elementary \nMetropolitan Statistical  school \nArea (MSA), top quartile \nfor MSA \n5 Points  General use  <15% rate for all  Tract in top 2 quartiles of  “Exemplary” or \nindividuals  median household income  “Recognized” \nfor county or, for site in an  elementary \nMSA, top 2 quartiles for  school \nMSA \n5 Points  Any  <15% rate for all  Tract in top quartile of  “Exemplary” or \nindividuals  median household income  “Recognized” \nfor county or, for site in an  elementary \nMSA, top quartile for  school \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 6 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 11 of 28   PageID 7855\nMSA \n3 Points  Any  <15% rate for all  Tract in top quartile of  N/A \nindividuals  median household income \nfor county or, for site in an \nMSA, top quartile for \nMSA \n1 Point  Any  <15% rate for all  Tract in top 2 quartiles of  N/A \nindividuals  median household income \nfor county or, for site in an \nMSA, top 2 quartiles for \nMSA \nUp to 7 Points  Any  The proposed development site is located in a QCT for which there \nis in effect a concerted revitalization plan (consistent with the \nelements described in §5.  See Revitalization Index, §4, below.   \nThe  Department  will  utilize  data  from  the  5-year  American  Community  Survey  to \ndetermine  a  development  site’s  qualification  under  the  poverty  and  income  criteria.  For \ncategories requiring an “Exemplary” or “Recognized” elementary school, the development site \nmust be located within the school attendance zone that has the applicable academic rating, as of \nthe beginning of the Application Acceptance Period, or comparable rating if the rating system \nchanges  by  the  same  date  as  determined  by  the  Texas  Education  Agency.  An  elementary \nattendance zone does not include elementary schools with district-wide possibility of enrollment \nor no defined attendance zones, sometimes known as magnet schools. However, districts with \ndistrict-wide enrollment and only one elementary school are acceptable. \nThe following additional factors, indicative of educational quality and opportunity or lack \nof affordable housing, will be incorporated as new below-the-line criteria:  \na.  Location within the attendance zone of a public school with an academic rating of \n“Recognized” or “Exemplary” (or comparable rating) by the Texas Education Agency (up to 3 \npoints): \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 7 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 12 of 28   PageID 7856\nA.  1 points if it is both an elementary school, and either a middle school or high \nschool; or \nB.  3 points if it is an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school. \nb.  A municipality or, if outside of the boundaries of any municipality, a county that has \nnever received a competitive tax credit allocation.  The application must also comply with all \nother anti-concentration provisions (2 points for general use/family or supportive housing; 1 \npoint for elderly). \nAll other Development Location incentive criteria in the current QAP, such as incentives \nfor developments in central business districts, will be removed in future QAPs, unless required \nby statute, in order to maintain high incentives to target HOAs.   \n3.  130% basis boost for transactions in HOAs. \nUnder the authority granted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, P. L. \n110-289, the 2012 QAP offers a 130% basis boost for transactions assisted by 9% LIHTCs that \nare located in HOAs as defined in paragraph 2, above. \nThe Department will continue to include in its QAPs a 130% basis boost for applications \nthat are intended to be located in HOAs.  This requirement will not preclude or limit the \nDepartment’s ability to offer a lawful basis boost in other appropriate instances. The authority \nfor states to define criteria for a 130% boost  for non-competitive 4% housing tax credit or tax-\nexempt bond developments is not available under §42 of the Internal Revenue Code.  \n4.  The remedial balance and the Revitalization Index.   \nThe  Opportunity  Index  clearly  provides  the  greatest  point  incentives  for  HOA \ntransactions  that  serve  the  general  public,  including  families,  that  are  also  in  areas  of \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 8 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 13 of 28   PageID 7857\nsignificantly greater income, the top quartile.  While a proposed transaction in a second quartile \ntract,  a  proposed  transaction  in  the  top  quartile  serving  a  targeted,  albeit  legally  targeted, \npopulation rather than the general population, or even a proposed transaction in a second quartile \ntract serving an elderly population would be characterized as HOA, it is clear that in order to \nachieve the spirit and intent of the Plan, it is only that top quartile/general population plan should \nreceive that greatest level of recognition for competitive enhancement.  This Plan does propose a \nmechanism allowing for a similar prioritization for a proposed transaction in a qualified census \ntract (QCT) that is the subject of a concerted plan of community revitalization, as federally \nmandated by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §42(m).  The Department contends that failure to \ngrant same preference for such transactions could be seen as inconsistent with federal law.  \nHowever, the Department is well aware of the fact that a significant level of continuing activity \nin  development  in  QCTs  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  remedial  objectives  of  this  Plan.   \nTherefore, it is critical to note that in developing this language, Department strongly believes that \nthe high thresholds established for revitalization plans will demand significant investments of \ntime, analysis, and local commitments of funding for non-housing activity from an applicant. \nAccordingly, these points are unlikely to achieve in the natal cycle after approval of a Remedial \nPlan, a significant number of applications that can demonstrably earn the maximum points for \nbeing in a QCT AND having in place a revitalization plan meeting the substantive criteria \nproposed.   \nAs the graphic below conveys, changes implemented in the 2012 QAP have clearly \nresulted in a virtual curtailment of QCT activity.  While such a curtailment might be viewed as \naccelerating a catch-up to restore a more balanced distribution of assisted developments in areas \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 9 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 14 of 28   PageID 7858\nof all income levels, it would not be consistent with a prospective race neutral distribution or the \ncongressionally expressed preferences set forth in the IRC.   \n \nTherefore, the Department believes that it is appropriate for an application in the area of \ngreatest opportunity to be given coequal incentives with an application achieving the greatest \nrevitalization purpose.  Without this balance the Plan would in effect be forsaking that sector of \nthe  community  in  greatest  need  of  this  federal  assistance.    However,  it  is  a  generally \nacknowledged  contention  that  tax  credit  developers  have  been  able  to  marshal  community \nsupport to validate the conclusions that they were meeting the objectives of IRC §42(m) possibly \nwhere meaningful non-housing revitalization activity was not occurring.  In order to assure that \nsuch efforts involve meaningful substance and do not create an unregulated opportunity to \ncharacterize  an  effort  as  revitalization  that  may  not  be  meaningful  and  substantive,  the \nDepartment has developed a concept similar to the Opportunity Index to address revitalization.    \nRevitalization index: \nPoints  Population  Criteria \nserved \n7 points  Any  The proposed development site is located in a QCT in which there is in effect a \nconcerted revitalization plan (consistent with the elements described in §5 and the \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 10 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 15 of 28   PageID 7859\nnon-housing costs, as reflected in the local government certified plan budget, \nexceed $25,000 per unit in the proposed development.    \n3 points  Any  The proposed development site is located in a QCT in which there is in effect a \nconcerted revitalization plan (consistent with the elements described in §5 and the \nnon-housing costs, as reflected in the local government certified plan budget, \nexceed $10,000 per unit but are less than $25,000 per unit.    \n2 points  Any   The proposed development site is not located in a QCT but there is in effect a \nconcerted revitalization plan (consistent with the elements described in §5 and the \nnon-housing costs, as reflected in the local government certified plan budget, \nexceed $10,000 per unit.    \nAn application seeking to receive points under the Revitalization Plan must provide the \nplan and plan budget for review at pre-application and provide substantiation of the budget \nthrough submittal of a local government certified copy of the plan and budget supporting the \nclaimed points at full application. \n5.  Strengthened  criteria  for  disqualifying  proposed  sites  that  have  undesirable \nfeatures.  \nIn the 2012 QAP, the Department included criteria for disqualifying proposed sites that \nhave undesirable features, as follows: \n(13) Development Sites with negative characteristics in subparagraphs \n(A)  -  (G)  of  this  paragraph  will  be  considered  ineligible.  If  Staff \nidentifies what it believes would constitute an unacceptable negative \nsite feature not covered by the those identified in subparagraphs (A) - \n(G) of this paragraph Staff may seek Board clarification and, after \nholding  a  hearing  before  the  Board,  the  Board  may  make  a  final \ndetermination as to whether that feature is unacceptable. Rehabilitation \n(excluding Reconstruction) Developments with ongoing and existing \nfederal  assistance  from  HUD  or  TRDO-USDA  are  exempt.  For \npurposes of this exhibit, the term 'adjacent' is interpreted as sharing a \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 11 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 16 of 28   PageID 7860\nboundary with the Development Site. The distances are to be measured \nfrom the nearest boundary of the Development Site to the boundary of \nthe negative characteristic. If none of these negative characteristics \nexist,  the  Applicant  must  sign  a  certification  to  that  effect.  The \nnegative characteristics include:  \n(A) developments located adjacent to or within 300 feet of junkyards;  \n(B) developments  located  adjacent  to  or  within  300  feet  of  active \nrailroad  tracks,  unless  the  Applicant  provides  evidence  that  the \ncity/community has adopted a Railroad Quiet Zone or the railroad in \nquestion is commuter or light rail (Developments located in a Central \nBusiness District are exempt);  \n(C) developments  located  adjacent  to  or  within  300  feet  of  heavy \nindustrial uses such as manufacturing plants, refinery blast zones, etc.;  \n(D) developments located adjacent to or within 300 feet of a solid \nwaste or sanitary landfills;  \n(E) developments where the buildings are located within the easement \nof  any  overhead  high  voltage  transmission  line  or  inside  the \nengineered  fall  distance  of  any  support  structure  for  high  voltage \ntransmission lines, radio antennae, satellite towers, etc. This does not \napply to local service electric lines and poles;  \n(F) developments where the buildings are located within the accident \nzones or clear zones for commercial or military airports; or  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 12 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 17 of 28   PageID 7861\n(G) development is located adjacent to or within 300 feet of a sexually-\noriented business. For purposes of this paragraph, a sexually-oriented \nbusiness  shall  be  defined  as  stated  in  §243.002  of  the  Texas \nGovernment Code.   \nAs a part of the Plan, the Department will continue to include the same or similar criteria \nin its QAPs for disqualifying proposed sites that have undesirable features. Additionally, the \nDepartment will incorporate a more robust process to identify and address other potentially \nundesirable  site  features  in  future  QAPs.  Under  this  criterion,  an  applicant  proposing \ndevelopment of multifamily housing with tax credits must disclose to the Department and may \nobtain the Department’s written notification of pre-clearance if the site involves any negative site \nfeatures at the proposed site or within 1000 feet of the proposed site such as the following: \na.  A history of significant or recurring flooding; \nb.  A hazardous waste site or a source of localized hazardous emissions, whether \nremediated or not; \nc.  Heavy industrial use; \nd.  Active railways (other than commuter trains); \ne.  Landing strips or heliports; \nf.  Significant presence of blighted structures; \ng.  Fire hazards which will increase the fire insurance premiums for the proposed \nsite; \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 13 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 18 of 28   PageID 7862\nh.  Locally known presence of gang activity, prostitution, drug trafficking, or other \nsignificant criminal activity that rises to the level of frequent police reports.  \nThe Department will develop a process for the efficient, timely resolution of the pre-\nclearance process.  The Department may require that disclosure occur on an expedited basis, \nincluding but not limited to during the pre-application process.  The Department will review \nthese matters as disclosed to them and will either issue or withhold a pre-clearance.  The \nstandard to be employed will be that the pre-clearance will be withheld if one or more of the \nfactors enumerated above are present at or within 1000 feet of the proposed site and are of a \nnature that would not be typical in a neighborhood that would qualify for HOA points under the \nOpportunity Index. An applicant providing disclosure will be encouraged to provide any plans \nfor mitigation of the present undesirable feature(s), which may include a concerted community \nrevitalization plan as described in §5.  \nIn  assessing  disclosures  the  Department  staff  may,  at  its  discretion,  conduct  a  site \ninspection.  Non-disclosure of any of the enumerated conditions if known or in the exercise of \nreasonable  diligence  could  have  been  ascertained  is  a  basis  for  withholding  pre-clearance.  \nWithholding or denial of pre-clearance may be appealed pursuant to the appeals process set forth \nin the applicable QAP. \nWith  respect  to  the  presence  or  absence  of  hazardous  waste  sites  or  emissions,  an \napplicant may rely on the required Phase I Environmental Site Assessment.  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 14 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 19 of 28   PageID 7863\n6.  Strengthening of incentives for applications in qualified census tracts where the \nhousing is part of a concerted community revitalization plan. \nConsistent with §42(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 2012 QAP offers incentives for \napplications in qualified census tracts and for applications in areas where the housing is a \nnecessary component of a community revitalization plan. In future QAPs, the Department will \nstrengthen the correlation between revitalization and development located in qualified census \ntracts and the requirements for establishing that true community revitalization is occurring and \nthat affordable housing is a necessary part of the revitalization and will continue to provide \nappropriate incentives for affordable rental housing developments meeting such strengthened \ncriteria.   \nBeginning with its 2013 QAP, the Department will establish a scoring criteria in which \nany application for low income housing tax credits located in a qualified census tract, as defined \nin §42(d)(5)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code, will be eligible for enhanced points, based on its \nlocation, if there is, as described below, a concerted revitalization plan that is in effect and to \nwhich the development will contribute.   \nA concerted community revitalization plan adopted by a municipality or county will be \ndeemed to exist based on the following: \na.  A community revitalization plan must have been adopted by the municipality or \ncounty in which the proposed development is intended to be located.  \nb.  The adopting municipality or county must have performed, in a process providing \nfor public input, an assessment of the factors in need of being addressed as a part of such \ncommunity revitalization plan.  Factors to be considered include the following: \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 15 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 20 of 28   PageID 7864\nA.  adverse environmental conditions, natural or manmade, that are material in \nnature  and  are  inconsistent  with  the  general  quality  of  life  in  typical  average  income \nneighborhoods.  By way of example, such conditions might include significant and recurring \nflooding, presence of hazardous waste sites or ongoing localized emissions not under appropriate \nremediation, nearby heavy industrial, uses or uses presenting significant safety or noise concerns \nsuch as major thoroughfares, nearby active railways (other than commuter trains), or landing \nstrips; significant and widespread (i.e., not localized to a small number of businesses or other \nbuildings)  rodent  or  vermin  infestation  acknowledged  to  present  health  risks  requiring  a \nconcerted effort; or fire hazards; \nB.  presence of blighted structures; \nC.  presence of inadequate transportation; \nD.  lack of accessibility to and/or presence of inadequate health care facilities, law \nenforcement  and  fire  fighting  facilities,  social  and  recreational  facilities,  and  other  public \nfacilities  comparable  to  those  typically  found  in  neighborhoods  containing  comparable  but \nunassisted housing;  \nE.  the presence of significant crime. \nF.  the presence, condition, and performance of public education; or  \nG.  the presence of local business providing employment opportunities.  \nH.  A municipality is not required to identify and address all such factors, but it \nmust set forth in its plan those factors that it has identified and determined it will address.   \nc.  The adopting municipality or county must have based its plan on the findings of \nthe foregoing assessment and must have afforded the public opportunity to provide input and \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 16 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 21 of 28   PageID 7865\ncomment on the proposed plan and the factors that it would address.  To the extent that issues \nidentified require coordination with other authorities, jurisdictions, or the like, such as school \nboards or hospitals, the adopting municipality should include coordination with such bodies in its \nplan and, to the extent feasible, secure their cooperation.   \nd.  The adopted plan, taken as a whole, must be a plan that can reasonably be \nexpected to revitalize the community and address in a substantive and meaningful way the \nmaterial factors identified.  The adopted plan must specifically address how the providing of \naffordable rental housing fits into the overall plan and is a necessary component thereof.   \ne.  The  adopted  plan  must  describe  the  planned  sources  and  uses  of  funds  to \naccomplish its purposes.   \nf.  For any application located in a qualified census tract at the time of application to \nbe eligible for enhanced points for this item based on its location, the revitalization plan must \nalready be in place as evidenced by as certification that:  \nA.  the  plan  was  duly  adopted  with  the  required  public  comment  processes \nfollowed;   \nB.  that funding and activity under the plan have already commenced; and  \nC.  the adopting municipality or county has no reason to believe that the overall \nfunding for the full and timely implementation of the plan will  be unavailable.   \nAt the time of any award of Low Income Housing Tax Credits the site and neighborhood \nof  any  unit  covered  by  the  award  and  must  conform  to  the  Department’s  rules  regarding \nunacceptable sites. \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 17 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 22 of 28   PageID 7866\nIt is recognized that municipalities and counties will need to devote time and effort to \nadopt a concerted revitalization plan that complies with the requirements of this remedial plan.  \nTherefore, for purposes of the first cycle of Low Income Housing Tax Credit awards following \nthe issuance of an Order adopting a remedial plan, the The Board of the Department may, in a \npublic meeting, determine that a revitalization plan substantively and meaningfully satisfies a \nrevitalization effort, notwithstanding one or more of the above factors not having been satisfied. \n7.  Promulgation of fair housing choice disclosure. \nThe Department will promulgate by rule a fair housing choice disclosure in a form \nsubstantially equivalent to that set out in Attachment A, advising prospective tenants in writing \nof a website or other method of contact where they can obtain information about alternative \nhousing and their rights under fair housing laws.  The Department will maintain a website \nproviding relevant information and identifying tax credit assisted properties searchable by ZIP \ncode, city, and/or county. The Department will require that no initial lease be entered into for a \nunit assisted with low income housing tax credits unless that disclosure has first been provided to \nthe prospective tenant.  \n8.  Annual  analysis  of  effectiveness  of  plan  and  continued  development  and \nenhancement of a policy of avoidance of over-concentration of low income housing units.  \nThe Department will annually conduct an analysis of the effects of its prior QAP to \ndetermine if that QAP was contributing to disparate impact; and will take appropriate and \nlawfully permitted measures to amend the next and subsequent QAPs (beginning with its 2013 \nQAP), to avoid present or potentially developing disparate impact in the allocation of low \nincome housing tax credits.  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 18 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 208   Filed 11/08/12    Page 23 of 28   PageID 7867\nAs each QAP is developed, the Department will analyze the distribution achieved under \nthe previous QAP.  It will take that analysis into account and use it to develop  (within the \nmeasures available to the Department under applicable law) changes in the incentives, threshold \nrequirements,  and  other  factors  to  address  any  potential  disparate  impact  and  to  achieve, \nprospectively, a broad and race neutral dispersion of low income housing tax credit assisted \nproperties.   \nThe QAP disparate impact analysis the Department performs will be made public.  The \npublic will be given opportunity to comment on the analysis, and the development of QAPs will \nalso be carried out in a public meeting or hearing with opportunity for review and comment by \nthe public, including the Plaintiff.  In order to achieve consistency on a statewide basis, the \nDepartment will endeavor to apply the principles and objectives in this Plan on a statewide basis.  \n9.  Review of challenged public input.  \nAny public comment that will be considered for negative scoring of applications, or as \nopposition to 4% non-competitive allocations, may be challenged if it is contrary to findings or \ndeterminations, including zoning determinations, of a municipality, county, school district, or \nother local governmental entity.  If any such comment is challenged, the party that made the \nchallenge will have to declare the basis for the challenge.  The party that made the comment will \nbe given seven (7) days to provide any support for the accuracy of its assertions.

GRAVES, JR., Circuit Judge: \nIn this housing discrimination case, the district court held that plaintiff \nThe  Inclusive  Communities  Project  (“ICP”)  had  proven  that  Defendants’ \nallocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”) in Dallas resulted in \na disparate impact on African-American residents under the Fair Housing Act \n(“FHA”).  The primary issue on appeal is the correct legal standard to be \napplied in disparate impact claims under the FHA.  We adopt the standard \nannounced  in  recently  enacted  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”) regulations regarding the burdens of proof in disparate \nimpact housing discrimination cases, see 24 C.F.R. § 100.500, and remand to \nthe district court for application of this standard in the first instance. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background \nICP  filed  this  action  against  Defendants  the  Texas  Department  of \nHousing and Community Affairs (“TDHCA”) and its Executive Director and \nboard members in their official capacities under the FHA, the Fourteenth \nAmendment, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983.  “ICP is a non-profit organization \nthat seeks racial and socioeconomic integration in the Dallas metropolitan \narea. In particular, ICP assists low-income, predominately African-American \nfamilies who are eligible for the Dallas Housing Authority’s Section 8 Housing \nChoice  Voucher  program  (‘Section  8’)  in  finding  affordable  housing  in \npredominately Caucasian, suburban neighborhoods.” Inclusive Communities \nProject, Inc. v. Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs (ICP II), 860 F. Supp. 2d \n312,  314  (N.D.  Tex.  2012)  (order  after  bench  trial)  (footnote  omitted).    A \n2 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 3     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \ndevelopment that receives tax credits under the LIHTC program cannot refuse \ntenants because of their use of Section 8 vouchers; thus “it is important to ICP \nwhere the developments are located in the Dallas metropolitan area.” Id. \nUnder  §  42  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  the  federal  government \nprovides  LIHTC  that  are  distributed  to  developers  of  low-income  housing \nthrough a designated state agency. See generally 26 U.S.C. § 42.  TDHCA \nadministers  the  federal  LIHTC  program  in  Texas.  See  Tex.  Gov’t  Code \n§ 2306.6701 et seq.  Developers apply to TDHCA for tax credits for particular \nhousing projects.  Such credits may be sold to finance construction of the \nproject.  ICP II, 860 F. Supp. 2d at 314.  The number of credits TDHCA may \naward  for  a  low-income  housing  project  is  determined  by  calculating  the \nproject’s “qualified basis,” which is a fraction representing the percentage of \nthe project occupied by low-income residents multiplied by eligible costs. See \n26 U.S.C. § 42(c). \nThere are two types of credits: 9% credits and 4% credits.  The 9% credits \nare distributed on an annual cycle and are oversubscribed, and developers \nmust compete with each other to earn the available credits.  As the district \ncourt explained:  \nCertain federal and state laws dictate, at least in part, the manner \nin which TDHCA can select the applications that will receive 9% \ntax credits.  First, I.R.C. § 42 requires that the designated state \nagency adopt a  “Qualified Allocation Plan” (“QAP”) that prescribes \nthe “selection criteria.” See id. at § 42(m)(1)(A)-(B).  The QAP must \ninclude,  inter  alia,  certain  selection  criteria,  see  id.  at  § \n42(m)(1)(C), and preferences, see id. at § 42(m)(1)(B); otherwise, \n“zero”  housing  credit  dollars  will  be  provided,  see  id.  at  § \n42(m)(1)(A).  Second, the Texas Government Code regulates how \nTDHCA  administers  the  LIHTC  program.    The  Code  requires \nTDHCA to adopt annually a QAP and corresponding manual. Id. \nat  §  2306.67022.    It  also  sets  out  how  TDHCA  is  to  evaluate \napplications.  TDHCA  must  first  “determine  whether  the \napplication satisfies the threshold criteria” in the QAP. Id. at § \n3 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 4     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \n2306.6710(a).  Applications that meet the threshold criteria are \nthen “score[d] and rank[ed]” by “a point system” that “prioritizes \nin  descending  order”  ten  listed  statutory  criteria  (also  called \n“above-the-line  criteria”),  which  directly  affects  TDHCA’s \ndiscretion in creating the “selection criteria” in each QAP. Id. at § \n2306.6710(b).  The Texas Attorney General has interpreted this \nprovision to obligate TDHCA to “use a point system that prioritizes \nthe [statutory] criteria in that specific order.” Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. \nNo. GA-0208, 2004 WL 1434796, at *4 (2004). Although the Texas \nGovernment Code does not mandate the points to be accorded each \nstatutory  criterion,  “the  statute  must  be  construed  to  require \n[TDHCA] to assign more points to the first criterion than to the \nsecond, and so on, in order to effectuate the mandate that the \nscoring system ‘prioritiz[e the criteria] in descending order.’” Id. \n(quoting Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6710(b)(1) (West 2004)).  And \nwhile TDHCA can consider other criteria and preferences (also \ncalled “below-the-line” criteria), it “lacks discretionary authority to \nintersperse other factors into the ranking system that will have \ngreater points than” the statutory criteria. Id. at *6 (citation and \ninternal  quotation  omitted).  Once  TDHCA  adopts  a  QAP,  it \nsubmits the plan to the Governor, who can “approve, reject, or \nmodify and approve” it. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6724(b)-(c) \n(West 2001).  Once approved, TDHCA staff review the applications \nin accordance with the QAP, underwrite applications in order “to \ndetermine  the  financial  feasibility  of  the  development  and  an \nappropriate level of housing tax credits,” id. at § 2306.6710(b)(1)(A) \n& (d), and submit their recommendations to TDHCA. See id. at § \n2306.6724(e).  TDHCA then reviews the staff recommendations \nand issues final commitments in accordance with the QAP. See id. \nat § 2306.6724(e)-(f). \nICP II, 860 F. Supp. 2d at 314-16 (footnotes omitted).  The parties heavily \ndispute the amount of discretion TDHCA has to award 9% credits to projects \nother than those receiving the highest scores.  By contrast, all agree that the \n4%  credits  are  allocated  on  a  non-competitive  basis  year-round  to \ndevelopments that use private activity bonds as a component of their project \nfinancing, some of which are issued by TDHCA.  Applicants need to meet only \ncertain threshold eligibility and underwriting requirements in order to receive \n4 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 5     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \n4% tax credits.  Applications for the 4% tax credits are not subject to scoring \nunder the QAP selection criteria. See id. at 316. \nIn March 2008, ICP filed suit against Defendants, claiming that the \ndistribution of LIHTC in Dallas violated 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983, the \nFourteenth Amendment, and the FHA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604 and 3605.  The FHA \nmakes it unlawful, inter alia, to “make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any \nperson because of race. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section 3605(a) provides that \nit  is  unlawful,  inter  alia,  “for  any  person  or  other  entity  whose  business \nincludes  engaging  in  residential  real  estate-related  transactions  to \ndiscriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in \nthe terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race. . . .”  Id. § 3605(a).  \nA  “residential  real  estate-related  transaction”  includes  providing  financial \nassistance for the construction of a dwelling. Id. § 3605(b).  ICP alleged that \nDefendants were disproportionately approving tax credit units in minority-\nconcentrated neighborhoods and disproportionately disapproving tax credit \nunits  in  predominantly  Caucasian  neighborhoods,  thereby  creating  a \nconcentration of the units in minority areas, a lack of units in other areas, and \nmaintaining and perpetuating segregated housing patterns.  \nICP filed a motion for partial summary judgment to establish standing \nand  a  prima  facie  case  of  discrimination.    Defendants  filed  motions  for \njudgment on the pleadings and summary judgment.  Defendants argued that, \nassuming that ICP had established a prima facie case, Defendants won as a \nmatter of law, under both disparate treatment and disparate impact theories \nof discrimination.1  The district court denied Defendants’ motions and granted \n                                         \n1 On appeal, Defendants now attempt to raise multiple challenges to the prima facie \ncase of disparate impact, including various challenges to ICP’s statistics and an argument \nthat ICP failed to isolate a specific policy or practice that caused the disparate impact.  Our \nown review of the record does not clearly resolve which of these challenges to the prima facie \ncase of disparate impact were waived in the district court.  Because we reverse and remand \n5 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 6     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nICP partial summary judgment, concluding that ICP had made a prima facie \nshowing of both intentional discrimination and disparate impact. Inclusive \nCommunities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs (ICP I), 749 \nF. Supp. 2d 486, 499-500, 501-02 (N.D. Tex. 2010) (order granting partial \nsummary judgment).  With regard to the disparate impact case, the court \nconcluded that “ICP has established that its clients are African-Americans, \nmembers of a protected class, who rely on government assistance with housing, \nand that TDHCA has disproportionately approved tax credits for non-elderly \ndevelopments  in  minority  neighborhoods  and,  conversely,  has \ndisproportionately denied tax credits for non-elderly housing in predominately \nCaucasian  neighborhoods.”  Id.  at  499.    In  particular,  the  court  relied  on \nevidence that, “from 1999-2008, TDHCA approved tax credits for 49.7% of \nproposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Caucasian areas, but only approved \n37.4% of proposed nonelderly units in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas.” Id.  The \ncourt also pointed to data showing “92.29% of LIHTC units in the city of Dallas \nwere located in census tracts with less than 50% Caucasian residents.”  Id.  \nThe court found that the statistical evidence was supported by other evidence, \nincluding the “Talton Report,” a report of the House Committee on Urban \nAffairs and prepared for the Texas House of Representatives, which concluded \nthat  TDHCA  disproportionately  allocates  LIHTC  funds  to  developments \nlocated in areas with above-average minority concentrations. Id. at 500.  The \ncourt also relied on a HUD study reaching “a similar conclusion.” Id.  The \ndistrict  court  held  that  “[t]his  evidence  establishes  that  TDHCA \ndisproportionately  approves  applications  for  non-elderly  LIHTC  units  in \nminority neighborhoods, leading to a concentration of such units in these areas. \n                                         \nfor other reasons, we do not address the issue of whether the district court erred by holding \nthat ICP had established a prima facie case. \n6 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 7     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nThis concentration increases the burden on ICP as it seeks to place African-\nAmerican Section 8 clients in LIHTC housing in predominately Caucasian \nneighborhoods.” Id. \nThe case then proceeded to trial on the remaining elements of ICP’s \nintentional discrimination and disparate impact claims.  After a bench trial on \nthe  merits,  the  district  court  found  that  ICP  did  not  meet  its  burden  of \nestablishing intentional discrimination and therefore found for the Defendants \non ICP’s § 1982, § 1983, and Fourteenth Amendment claims. ICP II, 860 F. \nSupp. 2d at 318-21.  On the disparate impact claim under the FHA, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 3604(a) and 3605(a), the district court applied the burdens of proof found in \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  decision  in  Huntington  Branch,  which  required \nDefendants to (1) justify their actions with a compelling governmental interest \nand (2) prove that there were no less discriminatory alternatives.  See id. at \n322-23 (citing Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d \n926, 939 (2d Cir. 1988), aff’d, 488 U.S. 15 (1988) (per curiam)).2  The district \ncourt assumed that Defendants’ interests were legitimate and bona fide, but \nconcluded that Defendants had not produced any evidence supporting their \ncontention  that  there  were  no  less  discriminatory  alternatives  to  the \nchallenged allocations.  Id. at 326.  The court concluded that Defendants had \nnot shown “that TDHCA cannot allocate LIHTC in a manner that is objective, \npredictable, and transparent, follows federal and state law, and furthers the \npublic interest, without disproportionately approving LIHTC in predominantly \nminority  neighborhoods  and  disproportionately  denying  LIHTC  in \npredominantly Caucasian neighborhoods.” Id.  For example, the court noted \nthat Defendants did not prove that “TDHCA cannot add other below-the-line \n                                         \n2 The Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit in Huntington Branch, but expressly \ndid not rule on the proper test for disparate impact housing discrimination claims in its \nopinion. Town of Huntington, N.Y. v. Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P., 488 U.S. 15, 18 (1988). \n7 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 8     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \ncriteria [to the QAP] that will effectively reduce the discriminatory impact \nwhile still furthering its interests.” Id. at 327.  “Moreover,” the court found, \n“although  defendants  maintain  that  TDHCA’s  discretion  in  creating  the \nselection criteria is limited to adopting below-the-line criteria, it appears that \nthis discretion is actually broader.  It appears to extend to the authority to \nchoose the number of points to be accorded each above- and below-the-line \ncriterion,  so  long  as  the  priority  of  statutory  above-the-line  criteria  is \nmaintained and the Governor approves.” Id. at 328.  Because it held that \nDefendants had not met their burden of proof, the district court found in favor \nof ICP on its discriminatory impact claim under the FHA. Id. at 331.   \nAfter trial, while the district court was considering the injunctive remedy \nthat should be implemented, Frazier Revitalization, Inc. (“FRI”) was granted \npermission  to  intervene  to  represent  the  interests  of  developers  or \norganizations  who  seek  to  revitalize  low-income  neighborhoods.    After \nconsidering submissions from the parties, the district court adopted a remedial \nplan including alterations to the QAP, stated that it would review the plan \nannually  for  at  least  five  years,  and  entered  judgment.  See  Inclusive \nCommunities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, No 3:08-CV-\n0546-D, 2012 WL 3201401 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 7, 2012), amended in part, 2012 WL \n5458208 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 2012).  The court also ordered Defendants to pay \nattorneys’ fees to ICP. 3 \nII.  Discussion \nDefendants, along with Intervenor FRI, appeal various issues.  However, \nwe find it necessary to reach only one issue: whether the district court correctly \n                                         \n3 The consolidated appeal, No. 13-10306, challenges the attorneys’ fees the district \ncourt awarded to ICP.  In light of our remand, we likewise vacate and remand the award of \nattorneys’ fees in that appeal. \n8 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 9     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nfound that ICP proved a claim of violation of the Fair Housing Act based on \ndisparate impact.   \nAs the district court correctly noted, violation of the FHA can be shown \neither by proof of intentional discrimination or by proof of disparate impact.  \nSee Artisan/Am. Corp. v. City of Alvin, Tex., 588 F.3d 291, 295 (5th Cir. 2009) \n(“We have recognized that a claim brought under the Act ‘may be established \nnot only by proof of discriminatory intent, but also by proof of a significant \ndiscriminatory effect.’”); Simms v. First Gibraltar Bank, 83 F.3d 1546, 1555 \n(5th Cir. 1996) (“We agree that a violation of the FHA may be established not \nonly by proof of discriminatory intent, but also by a showing of significant \ndiscriminatory effect.”).4  However, we have not previously determined the \nlegal  standards  that  should  be  applied  in  disparate  impact  housing \ndiscrimination cases.  \n                                         \n4 Defendants and FRI point to two recent cases in which the Supreme Court granted \ncertiorari to determine whether disparate impacts claims are cognizable under the FHA. See \nTwp. of Mount Holly, N.J. v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2824 (2013); \nMagner v. Gallagher, 132 S. Ct. 548 (2011).  Both cases were dismissed before the Court \nheard any argument.  Twp. of Mount Holly, N.J. v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., \n134 S. Ct. 636 (2013); Magner v. Gallagher, 132 S. Ct. 1306 (2012).  “Absent an intervening \nSupreme Court case overruling prior precedent, we remain bound to follow our precedent \neven  when  the  Supreme  Court  grants  certiorari on  an  issue.” United  States  v.  Lopez-\nVelasquez, 526 F.3d 804, 808 n.1 (5th Cir. 2008).  Our circuit precedent provides that \ndisparate impact claims are cognizable under the FHA. See Artisan/Am. Corp., 588 F.3d at \n295; Simms, 83 F.3d at 1555.  All other circuits that have considered the issue have agreed. \nSee Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc  v. Twp. of Mount Holly, 658 F.3d 375, 381 (3d \nCir. 2011); Gallagher v. Magner, 619 F.3d 823, 833-34 (8th Cir. 2010); Graoch Assocs. #33, \nL.P. v. Louisville/Jefferson Cnty.

Reg. \n11,460 (February 15, 2013) (codified at 24 C.F.R. § 100.500) (“HUD and every federal \nappellate court to have ruled on the issue have determined that liability under the Act may \nbe established through proof of discriminatory effects”). \n9 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 10     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nAs we stated above, on the disparate impact claim under the FHA, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a), the district court applied the burdens of proof \nfound in Huntington Branch. ICP II, 860 F. Supp. 2d at 322 (citing Huntington \nBranch, 844 F.2d at 939).  The district court noted the absence of controlling \nlaw, as this court has not previously addressed the question of what legal \nstandards apply to a disparate impact housing discrimination claim.  Our \nsister circuits have applied multiple different legal standards to similar claims \nunder the FHA.  See Robert G. Schwemm, Housing Discrimination Law and \nLitigation § 10:6 (2013) (discussing the various standards applied across the \ncircuits).  Most circuits agree that once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie \ncase, the burden shifts to the defendants to show that the challenged practice \nserves a legitimate interest. See Mt. Holly Gardens, 658 F.3d at 382; Gallagher, \n619 F.3d at 833-34; Graoch Assocs., 508 F.3d at 374; Mountain Side Mobile \nEstates, 56 F.3d at 1254; Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 936.  At that point, \nthe circuits diverge in some respects.  The Second and Third Circuits require a \ndefendant to bear the burden of proving that there are no less discriminatory \nalternatives to a practice that results in a disparate impact. See Huntington \nBranch,  844  F.2d  at  936;  Mt.  Holly  Gardens,  658  F.3d  at  382  (requiring \ndefendant to prove there is no less discriminatory alternative and plaintiff to \nprove  there  is  a  less  discriminatory  alternative).    The  Eighth  and  Tenth \nCircuits  place  the  burden  on  the  plaintiff  to  prove  that  there  are  less \ndiscriminatory alternatives. See Gallagher, 619 F.3d at 834; Mountain Side \nMobile Estates, 56 F.3d at 1254.  The Seventh Circuit has applied a four-factor \nbalancing test rather than burden-shifting. See Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 558 \nF.2d  at  1290.    The  Fourth  and  Sixth  Circuits  have  applied  a  four-factor \nbalancing test to public defendants and a burden-shifting approach to private \ndefendants. See Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs., 736 F.2d 983, 988 n.5 (4th Cir. \n1984); Graoch Assocs., 508 F.3d at 371, 372-74. \n10 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nHowever, after the district court’s decision in this case, HUD issued \nregulations regarding disparate impact claims under the FHA.  See 24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.500; Implementation of the Fair Housing Act’s Discriminatory Effects \nStandard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11,460 (Feb. 15, 2013).  Congress has given HUD \nauthority to  administer the FHA, including authority to  issue regulations \ninterpreting the Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(a), 3614a.  Specifically, 42 U.S.C. § \n3608(a)  gives  the  Secretary  of  HUD  the  “authority  and  responsibility  for \nadministering this Act,” and § 3614a provides expressly that “The Secretary \nmay make rules. . . to carry out this subchapter.”  The new regulations issued \nby HUD took effect in March 2013.  24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  The regulations \nrecognize,  as  we  have,  that  “Liability  may  be  established  under  the  Fair \nHousing  Act  based  on  a  practice’s  discriminatory  effect,  as  defined  in \nparagraph (a) of this section, even if the practice was not motivated by a \ndiscriminatory intent.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  The regulations further provide \nthat “A practice has a discriminatory effect where it actually or predictably \nresults in a disparate impact on a group of persons or creates, increases, \nreinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race, color, \nreligion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” Id. § 100.500(a).  \nFinally,  with  regard  to  the  burdens  of  proof  in  disparate  impact  housing \ndiscrimination cases, the regulations provide:  \n(1)  The charging party . . . has the burden of proving that a \nchallenged  practice  caused  or  predictably  will  cause  a \ndiscriminatory effect. \n(2)  Once the charging party or plaintiff satisfies the burden of \nproof  set  forth  in  paragraph  (c)(1)  of  this  section,  the \nrespondent or defendant has the burden of proving that the \nchallenged  practice  is  necessary  to  achieve  one  or  more \nsubstantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the \nrespondent or defendant. \n11 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 12     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \n(3)  If the respondent or defendant satisfies the burden of proof \nset forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the charging \nparty or plaintiff may still prevail upon proving that the \nsubstantial,  legitimate,  nondiscriminatory  interests \nsupporting  the  challenged  practice  could  be  served  by \nanother practice that has a less discriminatory effect. \n24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c).  \nWe now adopt the burden-shifting approach found in 24 C.F.R. § 100.500 \nfor claims of disparate impact under the FHA. See 24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  First, \na plaintiff must prove a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that a \nchallenged practice causes a discriminatory effect, as defined by 24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.500(a).  24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(1).  If the plaintiff makes a prima facie \ncase, the defendant must then prove “that the challenged practice is necessary \nto achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests . . \n. .” Id. § 100.500(c)(2).  If the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff must \nthen show that the defendant’s interests “could be served by another practice \nthat has a less discriminatory effect.” Id. § 100.500(c)(3). \nThese standards are in accordance with disparate impact principles and \nprecedent.  While the approaches of our sister circuits have varied, the most \nrecent decisions have applied a similar three-step burden-shifting approach. \nMt.  Holly  Gardens,  658  F.3d  at  382;  Gallagher,  619  F.3d  at  834;  Graoch \nAssocs.,  508  F.3d  at  374.    Further,  the  three-step  burden-shifting  test \ncontained in the HUD regulations is similar to settled precedent concerning \nTitle VII disparate impact claims in employment discrimination cases.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k); Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 624 (2009) (describing \nthe disparate impact burdens of proof in Title VII employment discrimination \ncases).  Many courts interpreting the FHA recognize the similar purpose and \nlanguage of the statutes and borrow from Title VII precedent to interpret the \nFHA.  See, e.g., Graoch Assocs., 508 F.3d at 371-73; Kyles v. J.K. Guardian Sec. \n12 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 13     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nServs., Inc., 222 F.3d 289, 295 (7th Cir. 2000) (“Courts have recognized that \nTitle VIII is the functional equivalent of Title VII and so the provisions of these \ntwo statutes are given like construction and application.”) (internal citations \nomitted)); Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 934-35.   \nGiven the complex record and fact-intensive nature of this case, and the \ndistrict court’s demonstrated expertise with those facts, we remand for the \ndistrict court to apply this legal standard to the facts in the first instance.  To \nbe clear, we do not hold that the district court must retry the case; we leave it \nto  the  sound  discretion  of  that  court  to  decide  whether  any  additional \nproceedings  are  necessary  or  appropriate.    Finally,  given  our  decision  to \nremand, we do not find it necessary to reach the additional arguments raised \nby Defendants in support of reversal.  \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons we have stated, we REVERSE and REMAND for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n13 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 14     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nJONES, Circuit Judge, specially concurring.\nAs a second-best result, I concur in the court’s judgment to reverse and \nremand this case for reconsideration under the recently promulgated HUD \nguidelines.  This is second-best, however, because on remand, the district court \nshould reconsider the State’s forceful argument that the appellees did not \nprove  a  facially  neutral  practice  that  caused  the  observed  disparity  in \nTDHCA’s allocation of LIHTC units to predominately “non-Caucasian” areas.  \nPerhaps the standard for proving a prima facie case of disparate impact in the \nfair housing context was uncertain before the HUD guidelines resolved circuit \nsplits.  In any event, because FHA cases will now be modeled closely upon the \nTitle VII formula, it is clear that the appellees could not rely on statistical \nevidence of disparity alone for their prima facie case.  See Smith v. City of \nJackson, 544 U.S. 228, 241, 125 S. Ct. 1536, 1545 (2005) (“[I]t is not enough to \nsimply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers.”); Pacheco v. Mineta, \n448 F.3d 783, 787 n.5 (5th Cir. 2003) (finding “Pacheco’s disparate impact \nallegations . . . wholly conclusional” because “[t]here is no suggestion of in what \nmanner the process operated so as to disadvantage Hispanics”); Simms v. First \nGibraltar Bank, 83 F.3d 1546, 1555 (5th Cir. 1996) (Fair Housing Act issue is \n“whether a policy, procedure, or practice specifically identified by the plaintiff \nhas a significantly greater discriminatory impact on members of a protected \nclass.”)  A plaintiff must specifically identify the facially neutral policy that \ncaused the disparity. \nThe appellees’ entire argument for disparate impact here assumed the \nconclusion:  there is a statistical “imbalance” in the location of LIHTC units \napproved by TDHCA, therefore there must be a disparate approval “practice” \nthat  causes  the  statistical  imbalance.    The  district  court  accepted  this \noversimplified  formulation.    But  under  disparate  impact  law,  the  State’s \nburden is NOT to justify the statistics, but only the facially neutral policy or \n14 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 15     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \npolicies that caused the statistics.  The State’s burden ensues only when a \nplaintiff isolates the policy that caused the disparity.  Without proof of an \noffending policy, alleged racial imbalance in and of itself is both the cause and \neffect of a violation.  This has not been the law for many years.  The Supreme \nCourt held in Wards Cove that: \n \n“[e]ven if on remand respondents can show that nonwhites are \nunderrepresented . . . in a [statistically correct] manner . . ., this \nalone will not suffice to make out a prima facie case of disparate \nimpact.    Respondents  will  also  have  to  demonstrate  that  the \ndisparity  they  complain  of  is  the  result  of  one  or  more  of  the \nemployment practices that they are attacking here, specifically \nshowing  that  each  challenged  practice  has  a  significantly \ndisparate  impact  on  employment  opportunities  for  whites  and \nnonwhites.  To hold otherwise would result in employers being \npotentially liable for ‘the myriad of innocent causes that may lead \nto statistical imbalances in the composition their work forces.’ ” \n \nWards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 657, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 2125 \n(1989)  (quoting  Watson  v.  Fort  Worth  Bank  &  Trust,  487  U.S.  977,  992, \n108 S. Ct. 2777, 2787 (1988)).  Put more bluntly, if the appellees’ framing of \ndisparate impact analysis is correct, then the NBA is prima facie liable for \ndisparate impact in the hiring of basketball players.   \nAs  the  district  court’s  opinions  demonstrate,  TDHCA's  policies  and \npractices for awarding LIHTC  grants  are anything but simple.  They are \ngoverned by federal and state statutes, which require satisfaction of numerous \ncriteria to ensure the integrity, financial viability, and effectiveness of the \nprojects.  One specific object of the federal tax credit provision is to advantage \nprojects  located  in  low  income  census  tracts  or  subject  to  a  community \nrevitalization plan.  26 U.S.C. § 42(m)(1)(B).  In essence, the appellees are \nseeking a larger share of a fixed pool of tax credits at the expense of other low-\nincome people who might prefer community revitalization.  To balance these \n15 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 16     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nconflicting goals while meeting the program’s other specifications, a complex \npoint system has been used and annually updated.

(“ICP”)  has\nstanding and whether it has established prima facie cases under the\nFair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a), the\nFourteenth Amendment (actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), and 42\nU.S.C. § 1982.  Concluding that ICP has demonstrated its standing\nbeyond peradventure, has established a prima facie case for each of\nits claims, and has adduced evidence that would enable a reasonable\njury to find in its favor on each of its claims, the court grants\nICP’s motion for partial summary judgment and denies defendants’\n\nmotions for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment.1 \nI\nThe background facts and procedural history of this case are\nset out in the court’s prior memorandum opinion and order.  See\nInclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty.\nAffairs,  2008  WL  5191935,  at  *1  (N.D.  Tex.  Dec.  11,  2008)\n(Fitzwater, C.J.) (“ICP I”).  The court therefore adds to ICP I the\nfacts  and  procedural  history  pertinent  to  the  court’s  present\ndecision.\nICP is a Dallas-based non-profit organization that assists\nlow-income persons in finding affordable housing and seeks racial\nand socioeconomic integration in Dallas housing.  In particular,\nICP works with African-American families who are eligible for the\nDallas Housing Authority’s Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program\n(“Section 8”).  ICP assists Section 8 participants in obtaining\napartments in predominately Caucasian,2 suburban neighborhoods3 by\n1Also pending is ICP’s November 9, 2009 motion for leave to\nfile supplemental appendix.  The proposed appendix addresses a\ncounterclaim——immunity under the Eleventh Amendment——subsequently\nwithdrawn on November 20, 2009.  Accordingly, the court denies\nICP’s motion as moot.\n2Throughout this memorandum opinion and order, the court uses\nthe term “Caucasian” to refer to the 2000 U.S. Census category for\nwhite persons who are neither Hispanic nor Latino.\n3ICP encourages its clients to obtain housing in areas that\nmeet the criteria for “Walker Target Area Tracts,” defined in the\nSettlement Stipulation and Order in Walker v. U.S. Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, No. 3:85-CV-1210-R, at 4 (N.D. Tex.\nMar.  8,  2001)  (Buchmeyer,  C.J.).    A  qualifying  census  tract\n- 2 -\n\noffering counseling, assisting in negotiations with landlords, and\nproviding financial assistance (for example, security deposits).\nAt times, ICP must provide “landlord incentive bonus payments” to\nlandlords to secure housing for Section 8 participants.  \nTDHCA4 is the state entity that administers the federal LIHTC\nprogram, granting tax credits under 26 U.S.C. § 42 to low-income\nhousing  developers  to  encourage  investment  in  low-income,\nmultifamily rental housing.  Developers can sell their tax credits\nto finance housing construction.  The tax credits are allocated\naccording to the federal statute, which requires the state agency\nto act according to an annual “Qualified Allocation Plan” (“QAP”)\ndeveloped by the agency.  See 26 U.S.C. § 42(m); 10 Tex. Admin.\nCode § 50.1 et seq. (2010) (setting forth QAP developed by TDHCA).\nTDHCA receives applications for proposed developments and has the\nsole  authority  to  approve  or  deny  tax  credits  for  those\n“according to the most recent decennial census, (i) has a black\npopulation at or below the average black population of the City of\nDallas, (ii) has no public housing, and (iii) has a poverty rate at\nor below the average for the City of Dallas.”  Id.  In addition,\nICP looks for neighborhoods that (1) have a poverty population of\n10% or less; (2) have a median family income of at least 80% of the\n2000  U.S.  Census  Dallas  Primary  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area\nmedian family income; and (3) are in a public elementary school\nattendance  zone  for  an  elementary  school  that  has  either\n“Recognized” or “Exemplary” status. \n4Unless  the  context  otherwise  requires,  the  term  “TDHCA”\nincludes TDHCA and its Executive Director and board members in\ntheir official capacities.  \n- 3 -\n\ndevelopments.5  The agency receives more applications than it can\nfund, and the exact amount of tax credits allocated to Texas varies\neach year (for example, $43 million in tax credits was allocated to\nTexas in 2007).  Any developer who receives LIHTC must accept as\ntenants otherwise-eligible Section 8 participants who use Section\n8 vouchers to help pay rent.  See 26 U.S.C. § 42(h)(6)(B)(iv).\nAccording to ICP, Section 8 participants struggle to obtain housing\nin non-LIHTC developments. \nICP alleges that TDHCA has disproportionately approved tax\ncredits for low-income housing in minority neighborhoods and has\ndenied  applications  for  non-elderly6  low-income  housing  in\npredominately  Caucasian  neighborhoods;  that  92%  percent  of  all\nLIHTC units in the city of Dallas are in census tracts where more\nthan  one-half  of  the  population  is  minority;  that  TDHCA  has\ndiscretion  in  determining  which  proposed  projects  receive  tax\ncredits, and that TDHCA improperly takes race into account (both of\nthe neighborhood and of potential residents), perpetuating racial\nsegregation in Dallas housing; that defendants made housing and\n5According  to  Texas  regulations,  “Developments  will  be\nineligible  if  the  Development  is  located  on  a  site  that  is\ndetermined to be unacceptable by the [TDHCA].  This determination\nwill be made at the sole discretion of the [TDHCA] . . . .”  10\nTex. Admin. Code § 50.6(j) (2010).\n6The  distinction  between  elderly  and  non-elderly  units  is\nsalient because the potential tenants of non-elderly LIHTC units\nare  more  likely  to  be  minority  than  the  potential  tenants  of\nelderly LIHTC units.\n- 4 -\n\nfinancial assistance for housing construction unavailable because\nof race, in violation of the FHA; and that defendants used race as\na factor in their allocation of tax credits, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment, actionable under § 1983, and § 1982, which\nrequires that defendants give all United States citizens the same\nright to lease property as Caucasian citizens.  ICP requests broad\nequitable relief, including, inter alia, an injunction requiring\nTDHCA to create as many LIHTC units in non-minority census tracts\nas in minority census tracts; forbidding TDHCA from considering the\nracial  composition  of  the  area  or  potential  residents;  and\nenjoining TDHCA from perpetuating racial segregation.\nICP moves for partial summary judgment, asking the court to\nhold  that  ICP  has  standing  to  bring  its  claims,  that  it  has\nestablished a prima facie case of racial discrimination based on a\npattern of racial segregation in LIHTC units, and that, under the\ncircumstantial evidence framework of Village of Arlington Heights\nv. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977),\ndefendants’ actions have a greater effect on non-Caucasians than on\nCaucasians.  Defendants move for judgment on the pleadings and for\nsummary judgment, asserting that ICP lacks standing and that it is\nnot entitled to relief on the merits.\n- 5 -\n\nII\nThe court begins by summarizing the standards under which the\nparties’ motions are to be decided.\nA\nDefendants  move  under  Rule  12(c)  for  judgment  on  the\npleadings.  A Rule 12(c) motion “is designed to dispose of cases\nwhere the material facts are not in dispute and a judgment on the\nmerits can be rendered by looking to the substance of the pleadings\nand  any  judicially  noticed  facts.”    Hebert  Abstract  Co.  v.\nTouchstone Props., Ltd., 914 F.2d 74, 76 (5th Cir. 1990) (per\ncuriam)  (internal  citations  omitted).    The  motion  “should  be\ngranted only if there is no issue of material fact and if the\npleadings show that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a\nmatter of law.”  Greenberg v. Gen. Mills Fun Grp., Inc., 478 F.2d\n254, 256 (5th Cir. 1973) (per curiam).  The standard for deciding\na motion under Rule 12(c) is the same as the one for deciding a\nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Great Plains Trust Co.\nv. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 313 n.8 (5th\nCir. 2002) (“A number of courts have held that the standard to be\napplied in a Rule 12(c) motion is identical to that used in a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion.” (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted)).\nB\nICP and defendants both move for summary judgment.  Their\nsummary judgment burdens depend on whether they are moving for\n- 6 -\n\nsummary judgment on a claim for which they will have the burden of\nproof at trial.  \nICP moves for summary judgment on claims for which it will\nbear the burden of proof at trial.  To be entitled to summary\njudgment,  ICP  “must  establish  ‘beyond  peradventure  all  of  the\nessential elements of the claim[.]’”  Bank One, Tex., N.A. v.\nPrudential Ins. Co. of Am., 878 F. Supp. 943, 962 (N.D. Tex. 1995)\n(Fitzwater, J.) (quoting Fontenot v. Upjohn Co., 780 F.2d 1190,\n1194 (5th Cir. 1986)).  “The court has noted that the ‘beyond\nperadventure’ standard is ‘heavy.’”  Carolina Cas. Ins. Co. v.\nSowell, 603 F.Supp.2d 914, 923-24 (N.D. Tex. 2009) (Fitzwater,\nC.J.) (quoting Cont’l Cas. Co. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.,\n2007 WL 2403656, at *10 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 23, 2007) (Fitzwater, J.)).\nDefendants move for summary judgment on claims for which they\nwill not bear the burden of proof at trial.7  They need only point\nto the absence of evidence of an essential element of ICP’s claim.\nSee Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986).  Once\ndefendants do so, ICP must go beyond its pleadings and designate\nspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.  See id.\nat 324; Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.\n7Insofar as defendants move for summary judgment on matters\nfor which they bear the burden of proof at trial (e.g., in the\ncontent of ICP’s FHA claim, the burden of proving that TDHCA’s\nactions were in furtherance of a compelling government interest),\nthey  must  satisfy  the  beyond-peradventure  standard  to  obtain\nsummary judgment.  See infra note 18.  \n- 7 -\n\n1994) (en banc) (per curiam).  An issue is genuine if the evidence\nis such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in ICP’s\nfavor.  See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248\n(1986).  ICP’s failure to produce proof as to any essential element\nof  a  claim  renders  all  other  facts  immaterial.    See  Trugreen\nLandcare, L.L.C. v. Scott, 512 F.Supp.2d 613, 623 (N.D. Tex. 2007)\n(Fitzwater, J.).  Summary judgment is mandatory if ICP fails to\nmeet this burden.  See Little, 37 F.3d at 1076. \nIII\nA\nICP and defendants both bring motions that require that the\ncourt decide whether ICP has standing to bring suit.  In ICP I the\ncourt held that it does.  See ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *6, *9\n(denying defendants’ motion to dismiss ICP’s claim for lack of\nstanding).  Defendants’ Rule 12(c) and summary judgment motions\nessentially urge the court to reconsider the analysis of ICP I,\nwhich the court declines to do.  But because ICP now moves for\nsummary judgment establishing that it has standing, the court will\ndecide the question under the summary judgment standard.  \nTo determine whether ICP had standing in the context of a\nmotion to dismiss, the court presumed that the allegations of ICP’s\ncomplaint were true.  See ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *3 (citing\nGarcia v. Boyar & Miller, P.C., 2007 WL 2428572, at *2 (N.D. Tex.\nAug. 28, 2007) (Fitzwater, J.)).  But at the summary judgment\n- 8 -\n\nstage, “each element [of standing] must be supported in the same\nway as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of\nproof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the\nsuccessive  stages  of  the  litigation.”    Lujan  v.  Defenders  of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  The court therefore will\nconsider evidence offered by ICP to support its summary judgment\nmotion on standing.  \nB\nThe  doctrine  of  standing  “involves  both  constitutional\nlimitations  on  federal-court  jurisdiction  and  prudential\nlimitations on its exercise.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498\n(1975).    To  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Article  III  of  the\nConstitution, ICP must show, at an “‘irreducible constitutional\nminimum,’” that it has “suffered ‘injury in fact,’ that the injury\nis ‘fairly traceable’ to the actions of the defendant[s], and that\nthe  injury  will  likely  be  redressed  by  a  favorable  decision.”\nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S.\nat 560-61).  The injury in fact, moreover, must be “concrete and .\n. . actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” and “the\ninjury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.”\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560 & 561 n.1 (citations omitted).\nOnly Article III standing is required to bring a claim under\nthe FHA.  See ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *3 (quoting Lincoln v.\nCase, 340 F.3d 283, 289 (5th Cir. 2003) (“The Supreme Court has\n- 9 -\n\nheld that the sole requirement for standing under the FHA is the\nArticle III minima.”)).  But ICP also asserts claims under 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983, for which there are prudential limitations\non standing.  See ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *6 (“The critical\nquestion, however, is whether the prudential rule against asserting\nthe  rights  of  others——inapplicable  under  the  FHA——bars  ICP’s\nstanding  under  these  statutes.”).    Under  the  prudential\nlimitations, “[o]rdinarily, one may not claim standing . . . to\nvindicate  the  constitutional  rights  of  some  third  party.”\nSingleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114 (1976) (quoting Barrows v.\nJackson, 346 U.S. 249, 255 (1953)).  In ICP I the court held that\nprecluding ICP from asserting its §§ 1982 and 1983 claims would not\nserve  the  purposes  of  the  prudential  rule  against  third-party\nstanding.  See ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *7.  Because the court is\nnot reconsidering that holding (and the parties do not urge the\ncourt to do so), it will only consider at the summary judgment\nstage whether ICP has established beyond peradventure that it has\nArticle III standing.\nC\n1\nTo satisfy Article III standing, ICP must first establish\ninjury in fact.  In ICP I the court cited Havens Realty Corp. v.\nColeman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982), in which the Supreme Court held if\n“[defendants’] steering practices have perceptibly impaired [a fair\n- 10 -\n\nhousing organization’s] ability to provide counseling and referral\nservices for low- and moderate-income homeseekers, there can be no\nquestion that the organization has suffered injury in fact.”  Id.\nat 379.  The Court pointed specifically to the “consequent drain on\nthe organization’s resources” as evidence of that injury.  Id.  ICP\nseeks to place its clients in Walker Target Area Tracts, see supra\nnote 3, or other high-opportunity (predominately Caucasian) areas.\nTo place Section 8 participants in LIHTC housing, ICP spent an\naverage of $491.00 per capita.  To place clients in non-LIHTC\nhousing, ICP expended an average of $993.00 per capita.  ICP’s\naverage cost to secure non-LIHTC housing is much greater than the\ncost to obtain LIHTC housing because ICP often must pay non-LIHTC\nlandlords bonus payments to convince them to participate in Section\n8 or to lower the rent, and it must make a larger security deposit.\nThis cost difference is even greater than these numbers reflect,\nbecause ICP must expend more time and effort to find non-LIHTC\nunits that will even accept Section 8 vouchers.  ICP has presented\nevidence that 86.6% of LIHTC developments informed ICP they would\naccept  Section  8  vouchers,  while  only  11.9%  of  non-LIHTC\ndevelopments  would  accept  them.    ICP  has  thus  presented\nuncontroverted summary judgment evidence that the unavailability of\nLIHTC units in Walker Target Area Tracts drains the organization’s\nresources.  This demonstrates that ICP suffered injury in fact due\nto TDHCA’s allegedly disproportionate denial of tax credits for\n- 11 -\n\ndevelopments in those areas. \n2\nTo  establish  causation,  ICP  presents  evidence  that  TDHCA\ndisproportionately denies tax credits to proposed developments in\nCaucasian neighborhoods, making it more difficult for ICP to find\nSection 8-participating housing in those areas.8  Because TDHCA is\nthe sole entity with authority to award tax credits to developers,\nits decisions directly affect the availability and geographical\ndistribution of low-income housing.  Moreover, TDHCA need not be\nthe sole cause of injury to be liable for that injury.  See, e.g.,\nGautreaux v. Romney, 448 F.2d 731, 739 (7th Cir. 1971) (holding\nthat  defendant  played  “significant”  role  in  Chicago’s  racially\ndiscriminatory housing system).  The court held in ICP I that it\ncould reasonably infer that “an increase in tax credits allocated\nfor proposed developments in predominately Caucasian areas would\nover time increase the number of LIHTC units available in these\nareas.”  ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *5.  If ICP is injured by the\nexisting distribution of low-income housing, and TDHCA’s actions\ndirectly and significantly affect that distribution, it follows\nthat ICP has established causation.  \nDefendants  argue  that  TDHCA  does  not  solely  control  the\nlocation of low-income housing in Dallas because the developers\nchoose where to locate housing.  But this argument misconstrues the\n8See supra § III(C)(1). \n- 12 -\n\nnature of ICP’s claims.  ICP does not complain of the distribution\nof low-income housing in general; ICP challenges the allegedly\ndiscriminatory actions of TDHCA in disproportionately denying tax\ncredits to proposed developments in Caucasian neighborhoods.  TDHCA\ndoes  control  the  approval  or  denial  of  applications  actually\nsubmitted.     \nDefendants also point to Jaimes v. Toledo Metropolitan Housing\nAuthority, 758 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir. 1985).  In Jaimes the court held\nthat plaintiffs (potential low-income housing tenants) could not\nestablish causation sufficient for standing even though they were\nexcluded from Toledo’s suburbs, where there was no public housing.\nSee id. at 1096.  But in Jaimes the court noted that, even if\ndefendants had sought to build such public housing, it was “still\na matter of speculation and conjecture as to whether [] third\nparty,  non-defendant  [suburban  town  governments]  would  grant\napproval for construction of units that plaintiffs could afford,\nqualify for, or be eligible to obtain.”   Id.  The court also\nemphasized that plaintiffs had pointed to “no specific proposed\nproject, location or site that might have been approved[.]”  Id.;\nsee also id. at 1096-97 (“[C]ourts have looked to a particular\nproject or housing site which may have been affected by particular\nactions or failures to act on the part of government entities or\nofficials.”).  \nIn the present case, no government agencies other than TDHCA\n- 13 -\n\nhave the authority to grant or deny tax credits.  Although TDHCA\nmust  follow  the  mandates  of  §  42,  it  has  final  discretion  in\nallocating tax credits.  In addition, ICP presents evidence that\nproposed developments in Caucasian areas were disproportionately\ndenied tax credits.  The direct actions of TDHCA in denying those\ntax credits, for reasons to be analyzed below, to actual proposed\ndevelopments distinguishes this case from the more hypothetical\ninjury presented in Jaimes.\nDefendants point to this sentence in ICP I: “Because no facts\nalleged  suggest  the  existence  of  any  independent,  race-neutral\nreasons  why  TDHCA  would  disproportionately  deny  tax  credit\napplications for proposed developments in Caucasian neighborhoods,\nit is fair and not merely speculative to trace this imbalance to\nthe alleged consideration of race.”  ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *5.\nDefendants argue that § 42’s stated preference for development in\nlow-income  areas  is  a  race-neutral  explanation  for  the\ndisproportionate  denial  of  tax  credit  applications  of  proposed\ndevelopments in predominately Caucasian neighborhoods.  They assert\nthat  this  race-neutral  reason  indicates  that  ICP  cannot  prove\ncausation.  But defendants’ race-neutral explanation, and whether\nit  is  pretextual,  goes  to  the  merits  of  ICP’s  claim,  not  to\nstanding.  ICP has demonstrated beyond peradventure that TDHCA’s\napproval or denial of tax credits to developers directly affects\nthe distribution of low-income housing in Dallas, which injures\n- 14 -\n\nICP.  The court holds that ICP has established the element of\ncausation.\n3\nThe third element is whether the injury to ICP will likely be\nredressed by a favorable decision.  As discussed in ICP I, the\nbroad equitable remedies available to this court would redress the\nalleged injury.  See ICP I, 2008 WL 5191935, at *6.  The court need\nnot address any further evidence because its analysis in ICP I is\nsufficient. \nAccordingly,  the  court  holds  ICP  has  established  standing\nbeyond peradventure, and it grants ICP summary judgment in this\nrespect.  The court denies defendants’ Rule 12(c) motion and motion\nfor summary judgment to the extent they seek dismissal based on\nICP’s alleged lack of standing.\nIV\nThe court now turns to ICP’s contention in its motion for\npartial summary judgment that it has established prima facie cases\nof discrimination under the FHA, § 1982, and § 1983.\nA\nAs  a  threshold  matter,  the  court  notes  that,  in  some\ninstances, the existence of a prima facie case is not relevant.\nSee Arismendez v. Nightingale Home Health Care, Inc., 493 F.3d 602,\n607 (5th Cir. 2007) (“Because this case was fully tried on the\nmerits, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework drops from\n- 15 -\n\nthe case . . . .  [T]he sufficiency of the prima facie case as such\nis no longer relevant.” (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)); Kanida v. Gulf Coast Med. Pers. LP, 363 F.3d 568, 575\n(5th Cir. 2004) (noting that while prima facie case is irrelevant\nafter trial on the merits, it is applicable in context of motions\nfor judgment as a matter of law and summary judgment).  The Supreme\nCourt has held that “[w]here the defendant has done everything that\nwould be required of him if the plaintiff had properly made out a\nprima facie case, whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer\nrelevant.”  U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S.\n711, 715 (1983).  But to evaluate the parties’ summary judgment\nmotions in this case, the court will consider ICP’s motion for\npartial  summary  judgment  as  it  relates  to  whether  ICP  has\nestablished prima facie cases.  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d)(1),\n“the  court  should,  to  the  extent  practicable,  determine  what\nmaterial facts are not genuinely at issue.”  If ICP can establish\na prima facie case in support of its FHA claim, the burden shifts\nto defendants to prove that TDHCA’s actions furthered a compelling\ngovernment  interest.    Moreover,  the  question  whether  ICP  has\nestablished a prima facie case of intentional discrimination under\n§§  1982  and  1983  is  relevant  to  other  disputed  issues  in\ndefendants’ motions, such as whether defendants’ justification for\nTDHCA’s actions is pretextual.  The existence of the prima facie\ncase, together with evidence that defendants’ proffered explanation\n- 16 -\n\nfor its challenged conduct is pretextual, is sufficient to find\nintentional  discrimination.    See  Reeves  v.  Sanderson  Plumbing\nProds., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147 (2000).  Additionally, the strength\nof the prima facie case can be relevant in determining whether\ndefendants’ proffered explanation for their actions is in fact\npretextual.  See, e.g., Prejean v. Radiology Assocs. of Sw. La.\nInc.,  342  Fed.  Appx.  946,  950  (5th  Cir.  2009)  (per  curiam).\nTherefore,  the  court  will  evaluate  ICP’s  prima  facie  cases  to\ndecide defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  Because defendants\nessentially do not contest ICP’s prima facie cases, the court will\nanalyze  this  question  in  the  context  of  ICP’s  partial  summary\njudgment  motion  instead  of  considering  it  in  the  context  of\ndefendants’ Rule 12(c) or summary judgment motions. \nB\nThe court first turns to ICP’s FHA claim.  The FHA prohibits\ndiscrimination  in  the  provision  of  housing.    See  42  U.S.C.\n§§ 3604(a) and 3605(a).9  “A plaintiff seeking recovery under [the\nFHA] may proceed under either a theory of disparate treatment or\n9Section  3604(a)  makes  it  unlawful,  inter  alia,  to  “make\nunavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race[.]”\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section 3605(a) makes it unlawful for “any\nperson  or  other  entity  whose  business  includes  engaging  in\nresidential  real  estate-related  transactions  to  discriminate\nagainst any person in making available such a transaction, or in\nthe terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race[.]”\n§ 3605(a).  A residential real estate-related transaction includes\nproviding financial assistance for the construction of a dwelling.\nSee § 3605(b).  \n- 17 -\n\ndisparate impact.”10  Arbor Bend Villas Hous., L.P. v. Tarrant Cnty.\nHous. Fin. Corp., 2005 WL 548104, at *12 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 9, 2005)\n(Means,  J.);  see  also  Huntington  Branch,  NAACP  v.  Town  of\nHuntington, 844 F.2d 926, 934 (2d Cir. 1988), aff’d, 488 U.S. 15\n(1988)  (per  curiam)  (“The  [FHA’s]  stated  purpose  to  end\ndiscrimination requires a discriminatory effect standard; an intent\nrequirement would strip the statute of all impact on de facto\nsegregation.”). \nC\nICP maintains in its motion for partial summary judgment that\nit has established beyond peradventure a prima facie case of racial\ndiscrimination under the FHA.  To establish a prima facie case of\ndiscriminatory impact (also referred to as discriminatory effect),\nICP must show “adverse impact on a particular minority group” or\n“harm  to  the  community  generally  by  the  perpetuation  of\nsegregation.”  Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 937; see also Arbor\nBend, 2005 WL 548104, at *12.  ICP need not show that TDHCA acted\nwith discriminatory intent or motive.  See Arbor Bend, 2005 WL\n10The court addresses only ICP’s discriminatory impact claim\nunder the FHA.  ICP did not specifically plead in its complaint or\nrequest summary judgment on an intentional discrimination claim\nunder the FHA.  Defendants did not respond in their answer to an\nintentional discrimination claim brought under the FHA.  The court\nwill thus examine ICP’s intentional discrimination claim under 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983.  \n- 18 -\n\n548104, at *12.  ICP’s prima facie burden is not a heavy one.11  See\nTex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981).\nICP  need  only  provide  evidence  that  raises  an  inference  of\ndiscrimination  because  “we  presume  these  acts,  if  otherwise\nunexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of\nimpermissible factors.”  See id. at 254 (citations omitted).  If\nICP establishes its prima facie case of discriminatory effect,\ndiscrimination is presumed.  See id.\nICP has established that its clients are African-Americans,\nmembers of a protected class, who rely on government assistance\nwith housing, and that TDHCA has disproportionately approved tax\ncredits for non-elderly developments in minority neighborhoods and,\nconversely,  has  disproportionately  denied  tax  credits  for  non-\nelderly  housing  in  predominately  Caucasian  neighborhoods.\n11In determining whether a plaintiff has established a prima\nfacie  case  of  discrimination  under  the  FHA,  some  courts  have\nutilized factors set forth by the Seventh Circuit in Metropolitan\nHousing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d\n1283 (7th Cir. 1977).  See Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of\nHuntington, 668 F. Supp. 762, 785-87 (E.D.N.Y. 1987) (considering\n(1) strength of plaintiff’s showing of discriminatory effect, (2)\nwhether  there  is  some  evidence  of  discriminatory  intent,  (3)\ndefendant’s  interest  in  taking  action  complained  of,  and  (4)\nwhether plaintiff seeks to compel defendant to provide housing or\nrestrain defendant from interfering with other property owners),\nrev’d, 844 F.2d 926 (2d Cir. 1988).  But these factors are not\nproperly part of plaintiff’s prima facie case; instead, they should\nbe considered as part of the “final determination on the merits.”\nHuntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 935-36 (“[T]reating the four factors\nas  steps  necessary  to  make  out  a  prima  facie  case  places  too\nonerous a burden on [plaintiffs].”).  Accordingly, the court will\nnot consider the Village of Arlington Heights factors when deciding\nwhether ICP has demonstrated a prima facie case.  \n- 19 -\n\nAccording to ICP’s evidence, from 1999-2008, TDHCA approved tax\ncredits for 49.7%12 of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9%\nCaucasian areas, but only approved 37.4% of proposed non-elderly\nunits in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas.13  ICP also analyzed data\nproduced by defendants in discovery that indicates that 92.29% of\nLIHTC units in the city of Dallas were located in census tracts\nwith less than 50% Caucasian residents.\nICP’s evidence is supported by the “Talton Report,” a report\nof the House Committee on Urban Affairs prepared for the House of\nRepresentatives, 80th Texas Legislature, which found that TDHCA\n“disproportionately  allocate[s]  federal  low  income  housing  tax\ncredit funds . . . to developments located in [areas with above\naverage minority concentrations].”  P. Oct. 2, 2009 App. 95.  The\nTalton Report notes that, as of 2006, 77% of LIHTC units in the\ncity of Dallas were in above-average minority areas, leading to\n“concentration problems.”  Id.  A study by the U.S. Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (“HUD”) reached a similar conclusion.\nSee id. at 435, 486 (reporting that, from 1995-2006, 67% of LIHTC\n12“Statistical analysis is admissible to establish disparate\nimpact.”  Budnick v. Town of Carefree, 518 F.3d 1109, 1118 (9th\nCir. 2008).  The disparate impact analysis will “of necessity, rely\nheavily on statistical proof.”  Owens v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.,\n2005 WL 1837959, at *13 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 2, 2005) (Sanders, J.).\n13Although  the  table  that  contains  this  information  is\npresented as part of Dr. Thompson’s report, he did not compile this\ninformation,  and  none  of  defendants’  objections  to  his  report\napplies.  Further, defendants have not objected to the reliability\nof this data.\n- 20 -\n\nunits in Texas were in greater than 50% minority areas, as opposed\nto 47% of all units; similarly, 69% of all LIHTC units in the city\nof Dallas were in greater than 50% minority areas, as opposed to\n45% of all units).  \nThis  evidence  establishes  that  TDHCA  disproportionately\napproves  applications  for  non-elderly  LIHTC  units  in  minority\nneighborhoods, leading to a concentration of such units in these\nareas.  This concentration increases the burden on ICP as it seeks\nto place African-American Section 8 clients in LIHTC housing in\npredominately Caucasian neighborhoods.  Other courts have held that\nactions that cause disproportionate harm to African-Americans and\nproduce  a  segregative  impact  on  the  entire  community  create  a\nstrong prima facie case.  See, e.g., Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at\n938 (holding that failure to re-zone Caucasian neighborhood for\nLIHTC apartments perpetuated segregation and had adverse impact on\nSection 8 participants who were disproportionately minorities);\nMetro. Hous. Dev. Corp. v. Vill. of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d\n1283, 1288 (7th Cir. 1977) (same); United States v. Yonkers Bd. of\nEduc., 837 F.2d 1181, 1219-20 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that city\nperpetuated racial segregation in housing, in violation of FHA,\nwhere 96.6% of subsidized housing was in areas with 40% or greater\nminority  population);  see  also  Dews  v.  Town  of  Sunnyvale,  109\nF.Supp.2d 526, 565-68 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (Buchmeyer, C.J.).  Because\nICP has adduced evidence that is uncontested, it has established\n- 21 -\n\nbeyond peradventure its prima facie case of discrimination under\nthe FHA.14  See St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510\nn.3 (1993) (noting that prima facie case can be established as a\nmatter of law where plaintiff’s facts are uncontested).  The court\ntherefore grants partial summary judgment holding that ICP has made\na prima facie showing that defendants violated the FHA. \nD\nThe court turns next to ICP’s intentional discrimination claim\nbrought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983.  ICP may use direct or\ncircumstantial  evidence  to  establish  its  prima  facie  case  of\nintentional discrimination under §§ 1982 and 1983.  See Vill. of\nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266.  ICP has presented no direct\nevidence  of  discrimination,  so  the  burden-shifting  method  of\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), applies.\nSee Arbor Bend, 2005 WL 548104, at *6. \nE\nICP moves for summary judgment establishing its prima facie\ncase of discrimination under § 1982 and the Fourteenth Amendment,\n14ICP  also  requests  that  the  court  grant  summary  judgment\nholding that defendants’ actions bear more heavily on minorities\nthan on Caucasians, one factor in the Village of Arlington Heights\ncircumstantial  evidence  framework.    Although  the  court  has\nauthority to enter a partial summary judgment determining that\nmaterial facts are not genuinely at issue, see Rule 56(d), it\ndeclines to do so as to this single circumstantial-evidence factor.\n- 22 -\n\nactionable under § 1983.15    \nSection 1982 “prohibits ‘all racial discrimination, private as\nwell as public,’ with respect to property rights.”  Evans v.

Appx. 455 (5th Cir. 2010).\nICP alleges that defendants have violated the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits intentional\nracial  segregation  in  government-assisted  housing.    See,  e.g.,\nBanks v. Dallas Hous. Auth., 119 F.Supp.2d 636, 638 n.3 (N.D. Tex.\n2000) (Kaplan, J.).   \nTo prove claims under § 1982 and the Equal Protection Clause,\n15The  court  uses  the  term  “prima  facie”  to  mean  the\nestablishment of a legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption in the\nMcDonnell Douglas framework, recognizing that in the more general\nsense, “prima facie” is a phrase used to describe the plaintiff’s\nburden of producing enough evidence to permit the trier of fact to\ninfer the fact at issue.  See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 n.7; see\nalso Askin v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 600 F. Supp. 751, 755\n(D. Ky. 1985) (“Even though the prima facie case may have been\nenough to shift the burden of production to the defendant, it is\nnot necessarily enough to entitle the plaintiff to submit his or\nher case to the jury.”).\n- 23 -\n\nICP  must  demonstrate  discriminatory  intent,  not  merely\ndiscriminatory effect.  See City of Cuyahoga Falls v. Buckeye Cmty.\nHope Found., 538 U.S 188, 195 (2003) (quoting Vill. of Arlington\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 265 (“Proof of racially discriminatory intent\nor purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause.”)); see also Hanson v. Veterans Admin., 800 F.2d 1381, 1386\n(5th  Cir.  1986)  (noting  that  although  FHA  claim  requires  only\nshowing of discriminatory effect, § 1982 claim requires finding of\nintentional racial discrimination); Dews, 109 F.Supp.2d at 570 (“In\ncontrast to claims brought under the [FHA], plaintiffs suing under\n§§ 1981, 1982, 1983 and 2000d must prove discriminatory intent.”).\nICP need only present enough evidence to give rise to an\ninference of discrimination.  See Kennedy v. City of Zanesville,\n505 F.Supp.2d 456, 493 (S.D. Ohio 2007).  The prima facie case is\nnot inflexible, and the specific facts required to be proved may\nvary depending on the factual situation.  See id. at 493-94.  “It\nis relatively easy . . . for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie\ncase[.]16  Arbor  Bend,  2005  WL  548104,  at  *7  (quoting  Britt  v.\nGrocers Supply Co., 978 F.2d 1441, 1450 (5th Cir. 1992)).\n16When a summary judgment motion on a discrimination claim is\nevaluated in the McDonnell Douglas framework, summary judgment is\nmost appropriate at the pretext stage, not when addressing the\nplaintiff’s prima facie case or the defendant’s burden of producing\nevidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.  See Arbor\nBend, 2005 WL 548104, at *7.  It is thus relatively easy for ICP to\nestablish a prima facie case and for TDHCA to meet its burden of\nproduction.  See id.\n- 24 -\n\nF\nICP has presented enough evidence to give rise to an inference\nthat TDHCA discriminated on the basis of race.  Evidence that may\ngive rise to an inference of discrimination includes statistical\nproof, comparative evidence, proof of a suspect sequence of events,\nor evidence of a subjective decisionmaking process.  See Kennedy,\n505 F.Supp.2d at 493-94.\nFirst, ICP has presented statistical and comparative evidence\nthat may give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.  ICP\nalleges that TDHCA is more likely to approve LIHTC developments in\nCaucasian neighborhoods if the likely tenants are Caucasian.  ICP\nhighlights the fact that, in Caucasian neighborhoods, elderly LIHTC\nhousing is approved more often than non-elderly LIHTC housing, and\nelderly residents are more likely to be Caucasian.  According to\nTDHCA data, from 1999 to 2008, TDHCA approved tax credits for 70.2%\nof the proposed elderly units in 90% or greater Caucasian census\ntracts.  TDHCA approved just 37.4% of proposed non-elderly units in\nthe same tracts.\nICP also presents evidence of a suspect sequence of events,\nand that TDHCA employs a subjective decisionmaking process.  ICP\nrelies on evidence that, from 1991-1993, TDHCA considered as one of\nits LIHTC selection criteria whether a development would provide\ndesegregated housing opportunities.  In 1994, TDHCA eliminated this\ncriterion despite the concern about segregation in Dallas housing\n- 25 -\n\nwidely noted at the time due to the contemporaneous Dallas housing\ndesegregation case.  See Walker v. City of Mesquite, No. 3:85-CV-\n1210-R (N.D. Tex. Filed June 25, 1985) (Buchmeyer, C.J.).  ICP\nsuggests  that  the  “repeal”  of  TDHCA’s  written  desegregation\npreference in favor of TDHCA’s discretion is related directly to\nTDHCA’s intentional discrimination.  P. Oct. 22, 2009 Br. 18.\nFor direct evidence of intent, ICP relies on contemporary\nstatements made by TDHCA officials in board meetings as indications\nthat  race  influenced  defendants’  actions.    For  example,  at  a\nFebruary 2003 board meeting, TDHCA board member Shadrick Bogany\n(“Bogany”) stated: “I’m tired of [these projects] being put in\nminority communities all the time.”17  P. Oct. 2, 2009 App. 871.\nLater  in  the  board  meeting,  he  repeated,  “And  you  know,  it’s\njust——it’s amazing to me how we constantly concentrate these all\nover——in just the minority communities.”  Id. at 873.  Bogany also\nprotested at a later meeting that the board was creating a “tax-\ncredit city” in a minority neighborhood in Houston.  He argued that\nthe TDHCA should not approve a proposed development because the\nminority neighborhood already contained 17 LIHTC developments, and\nthat the next QAP needed to address the concentration issue.  He\npointed to the underdevelopment and lack of retail in the area, and\n17ICP points to other statements by board members, but the\ncourt’s review indicates that they refer to the over-saturation of\nLIHTC units in some areas in Dallas; they express no concern that\nis specific to minority areas.\n- 26 -\n\nnoted that the city representatives arguing for the development\nwere not from the area.  “[C]ontemporary statements by members of\nthe decisionmaking body, minutes of its meetings, or reports” may\nbe “highly relevant” in establishing discriminatory intent.  Vill.\nof  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  267-68.    Although  Bogany’s\nstatements  are  not  admissions  of  racial  discrimination,  the\ntotality  of  the  evidence  presented  by  ICP  gives  rise  to  an\ninference of discriminatory intent.  \nThe court holds that ICP has presented enough evidence to\nestablish  beyond  peradventure  an  inference  of  discriminatory\nintent.  The court thus grants ICP summary judgment as to its prima\nfacie case under §§ 1982 and 1983. \nV\nThe court now turns to the remaining parts of defendants’ Rule\n12(c) motion and motion for summary judgment. \nA\nIn their Rule 12(c) motion and motion for summary judgment,\ndefendants request that the court hold that there is no genuine\nissue  of  material  fact  that  their  actions  serve  a  compelling\ngovernment interest, as required for ICP’s FHA claim,18 and that ICP\n18Although defendants’ motion for summary judgment is styled\na  “no  evidence”  motion,  under  the  applicable  law,  once  ICP\ndemonstrated  a  prima  facie  case  of  discrimination,  the  burden\nshifted  to  defendants  to  prove  that  their  actions  serve  a\ncompelling government interest.  See AHF Cmty. Dev., LLC v. City of\nDallas, 633 F.Supp.2d 287, 304 (N.D. Tex. 2009) (Fitzwater, C.J.).\nTherefore, to be entitled to summary judgment as to ICP’s FHA\n- 27 -\n\nhas presented no evidence that defendants’ actions are pretextual,\nas  required  for  ICP’s  §§  1982  and  1983  claims.    Because,  as\nexplained below, the court holds that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact as to whether defendants’ reason is pretextual and as\nto whether TDHCA’s actions serve a compelling government interest,\nthe court denies defendants’ Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the\npleadings.  The court must go beyond the pleadings and consider the\nevidence.  The court will, however, consider defendants’ arguments\nmade  in  support  of  their  Rule  12(c)  motion  in  deciding  their\nsummary judgment motion.\nB\nThe  court  considers  first  defendants’  motion  for  summary\njudgment as to ICP’s FHA claim.  Because ICP has established its\nprima facie case of discriminatory impact under the FHA, the burden\nshifts  to  defendants  to  prove  that  TDHCA’s  actions  were  in\nfurtherance of a compelling government interest.  See AHF Cmty.\nDev., LLC v. City of Dallas, 633 F.Supp.2d 287, 304 (N.D. Tex.\n2009) (Fitzwater, C.J.); see also Arbor Bend, 2005 WL 548104, at\n*12; Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 939.  This interest must be\nbona fide and legitimate, and there must be no less discriminatory\nalternatives.  See Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 939 (holding that\n“[t]he McDonnell Douglas test, however, is an intent-based standard\nclaim, defendants must establish beyond peradventure that their\nactions further a compelling government interest.  \n- 28 -\n\nfor disparate treatment cases inapposite to the disparate impact\nclaim asserted here.  No circuit, in an impact case, has required\nplaintiffs  to  prove  that  defendants’  justifications  were\npretextual.”). \nDefendants  concede  for  purposes  of  their  summary  judgment\nmotion  that  ICP  has  established  a  prima  facie  case,  and  they\nmaintain  that  their  actions  further  a  compelling  government\ninterest.    Defendants  argue  that  the  concentration  of  LIHTC\ndevelopments in inner-city areas serves a compelling government\ninterest; that 26 U.S.C. § 42, the statute that establishes low-\nincome  housing  tax  credits,  compels  defendants  to  locate\ndevelopments in the most impoverished areas; that it is impossible\nfor defendants to comply with § 42 and achieve ICP’s request that\n50% of LIHTC developments be located in the suburbs; and that to\nthe extent they conflict, § 42 controls over the FHA and § 1982. \nTo determine whether defendants’ justification rises to the\nlevel of a compelling government interest, the court will consider\n“(1) whether [TDHCA’s actions] in fact further[] the governmental\ninterest  asserted;  (2)  whether  the  public  interest  served  by\n[TDHCA’s  actions]  is  constitutionally  permissible  and  is\nsubstantial enough to outweigh the private detriment caused by it;\nand (3) whether less drastic means are available whereby the stated\ngovernmental interest may be attained.”  See Arbor Bend, 2005 WL\n548104, at *12 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The court holds\n- 29 -\n\nthat TDHCA has not established beyond peradventure that its actions\nfurthered a compelling government interest.  \nDefendants have failed to establish that TDHCA cannot comply\nwith § 42 in a way that has less discriminatory impact on the\ncommunity.  They offer as their justification TDHCA’s compliance\nwith § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii), which provides that a qualified allocation\nplan gives preference to projects serving lowest-income tenants and\nprojects  that  are  located  in  qualified  census  tracts  (areas\ndesignated  by  HUD  as  low-income).    Defendants  have  failed  to\nestablish without genuine dispute that TDHCA cannot comply with\nboth § 42 and the FHA.  Defendants in fact acknowledge that there\nis no conflict between § 42 and the FHA.  The court therefore\ndenies defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to ICP’s FHA\nclaim.  See, e.g., Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 941 (holding that\ndefendant town violated the FHA, reversing district court, and\nentering judgment for plaintiff NAACP).19\n19In Arbor Bend the plaintiff housing development filed an\napplication with the defendant housing finance corporation seeking\nto become a participant in a tax-credit low-income housing program.\nArbor  Bend,  2005  WL  548104,  at  *1.    The  defendant  denied  the\nplaintiff’s application for funding.  See id. at *3.  The plaintiff\nsued,  alleging  that  the  defendant’s  decision  not  to  fund  the\ndevelopment was motivated by race and familial status of the likely\ntenants.    See  id.    The  court  held  that,  regardless  of  the\nplaintiff’s establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination,\nthe  defendant’s  actions  furthered  the  compelling  government\ninterest  of  not  increasing  the  burden  on  already-overcrowded\nschools in the area.  See id. at *12.  The court thus granted\ndefendant’s motion for summary judgment.  See id. at *17.\nBut in Dews Chief Judge Buchmeyer held that the defendant\ntown’s  justifications  for  its  zoning  plan,  which  had  a\n- 30 -\n\nC\nThe  court  now  considers  defendants’  motion  for  summary\njudgment as to ICP’s §§ 1982 and 1983 claims.  Because ICP has\nestablished its prima facie case of discriminatory effect under\nMcDonnell Douglas, the burden shifts to defendants to articulate a\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their actions.  See St.\nMary’s  Honor  Ctr.,  509  U.S.  at  506-07  (addressing  racial\ndiscrimination claim under Title VII).  Defendants’ burden is one\nof production, not proof, and involves no credibility assessments.\nSee, e.g., West v. Nabors Drilling USA, Inc., 330 F.3d 379, 385\n(5th Cir. 2003) (age discrimination case).  “It is important to\nnote,  however,  that  although  the  McDonnell  Douglas  presumption\nshifts  the  burden  of  production  to  the  defendant[s],  ‘[t]he\nultimate  burden  of  persuading  the  trier  of  fact  that  the\ndefendant[s]  intentionally  discriminated  against  the  plaintiff\nremains at all times with the plaintiff.’”  St. Mary’s Honor Ctr.,\n509 U.S. at 507 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253) (emphasis in\noriginal); see also Simms v. First Gibraltar Bank, 83 F.3d 1546,\ndiscriminatory effect, were not bona fide, legitimate, or the least\ndiscriminatory means of accomplishing zoning objectives.  Dews, 109\nF.Supp.2d at 568-69.  The defendant maintained that its “one-unit-\nper-acre” zoning was necessary to protect public health and comply\nwith  regional  obligations  of  environmental  protection,\ntransportation, air quality, and agricultural protection.  See id.\nChief Judge Buchmeyer found that this justification was pretextual\nand that less discriminatory zoning plans were available.  See id.\nHe held that the plaintiff had established liability under the FHA.\nSee id. at 569.   \n- 31 -\n\n1559  (5th  Cir.  1996)  (holding  that  plaintiff  did  not  present\nsufficient evidence of discrimination to find a violation of the\nFHA).  “It is relatively easy . . . for a defendant to articulate\na legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his decision.”  Arbor\nBend, 2005 WL 548104, at *7 (quoting Britt, 978 F.2d at 1450). \nOnce defendants have produced a nondiscriminatory reason, the\nburden  shifts  back  to  ICP  to  prove  that  defendants’  proffered\nreason  is  pretextual,  which  is  circumstantial  evidence  of\ndiscrimination.  See West, 330 F.3d at 385 (“It is permissible for\nthe trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from\nthe falsity of the employer’s explanation.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); St. Mary’s Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 511 (Title VII\ncase) (holding that “rejection of the defendant’s proffered reasons\nwill  permit  the  trier  of  fact  to  infer  the  ultimate  fact  of\nintentional discrimination . . . .  But the [appellate court’s]\nholding that rejection of the defendant’s proffered reasons compels\njudgment for the plaintiff” is incorrect).  “[P]laintiffs must\npresent evidence that would allow a rational factfinder to make a\nreasonable inference that race was a determinative reason for the\nhousing decision.”  Jim Sowell Constr. Co. v. City of Coppell, 61\nF.Supp.2d 542, 546 (N.D. Tex. 1999) (Fitzwater, J.) (citing Simms,\n83  F.3d  at  1556).    But  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that\n“discrimination  may  well  be  the  most  likely  alternative\nexplanation”  for  defendants’  actions  once  the  plaintiff  offers\n- 32 -\n\nevidence that defendants’ reason is pretextual.  See Reeves, 530\nU.S.  at  148  (“[A]  plaintiff’s  prima  facie  case,  combined  with\nsufficient  evidence  to  find  that  the  employer’s  asserted\njustification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude\nthat the employer unlawfully discriminated.”); see also Russell v.\nMcKinney Hosp. Venture, 235 F.3d 219, 223 (5th Cir. 2000).  The\nCourt cautioned, however, that there are instances where although\nplaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination and\noffered  evidence  that  defendants’  justification  is  false,  no\nrational factfinder could conclude that defendants’ actions were\ndiscriminatory.  See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148.\nD\nDefendants offer a nondiscriminatory reason for their actions\nby pointing to the statute establishing low-income housing tax\ncredits, 26 U.S.C. § 42.20  They argue that the statute specifically\nencourages  awarding  tax  credits  to  developments  in  the  most\nimpoverished neighborhoods, which are often minority areas.21  In\n20See also supra § V(B).\n21Defendants suggest that this case should be resolved under\nprinciples of statutory construction.  Because they maintain that\nthey are simply following the mandates of § 42, they argue that\ntheir  actions  must  be  legal,  even  if  they  violate  the  FHA  or\n§ 1982, because § 42 is the most recent and specific statute.  The\ncourt declines to evaluate this case on this basis.  \nFirst,  ICP  alleges  violations  of  statutes  and  of  the\nFourteenth Amendment.  Second, the FHA, § 1982, and § 42 are not in\ndirect tension, and it is not clear that TDHCA could not comply\nwith the three statutes.  Nothing in § 42 requires that entities\nlike TDHCA act in a discriminatory manner or in violation of the\n- 33 -\n\nother words, they maintain that the concentration of LIHTC units in\nminority areas is the direct result of the mandate of § 42, which\nrequires that defendants give preference to developments “serving\nthe  lowest  income  tenants”  and  “located  in  ‘qualified  census\ntracts.’”  Ds. Oct. 2, 2009 Br. 13.22  Because defendants have\nproduced a nondiscriminatory reason for their actions, the court\nneed not make any credibility assessment of this proffered reason\nat this time.  See Kretchmer v. Eveden, Inc., 374 Fed. Appx. 493,\n495 (5th Cir. 2010) (per curiam).  The court holds that defendants\nhave  met  their  burden  of  production  as  to  the  second  step  of\nMcDonnell Douglas.\nE\nThe court now turns to the third step and holds that ICP has\npresented sufficient evidence that defendants’ proffered reason is\npretextual to require a trial.  See, e.g., Britt, 978 F.2d at 1450\n(age discrimination case) (“In the context of summary judgment\n. . ., the question is not whether the plaintiff proves pretext,\nFHA or § 1982.  “The courts are not at liberty to pick and choose\namong congressional enactments, and when two statutes are capable\nof co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly\nexpressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each\nas  effective.”    Morton  v.  Mancari,  417  U.S.  535,  551  (1974).\nTherefore,  the  jury  must  decide  whether  defendants’  actions\nviolated the FHA, § 1982, and § 1983, even if they demonstrate that\nTDHCA followed § 42.\n22In particular, §§ 42(d)(5)(B)(i) and (ii) specifically allow\na proposed development in a “qualified census tract” (a low-income\narea) to receive 130% of the tax credits a LIHTC development not in\nsuch an area would receive. \n- 34 -\n\nbut rather whether the plaintiff raises a genuine issue of fact\nregarding pretext.”).  The following examples are illustrative.23\nFirst, ICP has produced evidence that only 34% of all LIHTC\nunits are in qualified census tracts, and that only 39.8% of all\nLIHTC units in qualified census tracts received the 130% bonus.\nUnder TDHCA’s QAP, applications are awarded points if they meet\ndesirable selection criteria, and can receive over 200 points.  See\n10 Tex. Admin. Code § 50.9.  A proposed location in a qualified\ncensus tract earns an application just one point, equal to the\nbonus given to developments with a gazebo.  See 10 Tex. Admin. Code\n§§ 50.9(i)(25) and (h)(4)(A)(ii)(III).  Thus ICP has presented\nevidence that TDHCA’s primary justification, that its actions are\nrequired by § 42, is relevant to only 34% of TDHCA’s developments.\nSecond, ICP points again to the evidence of discriminatory\nintent discussed supra at § IV(F).  Circumstantial evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent allows a jury to make a reasonable inference\nthat race was a determinative reason for the housing decision.  See\nVill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68; Jim Sowell Constr.\nCo.,  61  F.Supp.2d  at  546-47  (listing  non-exhaustive  guiding\nfactors, including (1) the discriminatory effect of the official\naction, (2) the historical background of the decision, (3) the\n23When this court denies rather than grants summary judgment,\nit typically does not set out in detail the evidence that creates\na genuine issue of material fact.  See, e.g., Swicegood v. Med.\nProtective Co., 2003 WL 22234928, at *17 n.25 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 19,\n2003) (Fitzwater, J.).\n- 35 -\n\nspecific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,\n(4) departures from the normal procedure, (5) departures from the\nnormal  substantive  factors,  and  (6)  the  legislative  or\nadministrative  history  of  the  decision).    ICP  has  presented\nevidence  of  the  discriminatory  effect  of  TDHCA’s  tax  credit\nallocation.    ICP  has  also  produced  minutes  from  TDHCA  board\nmeetings in which tax credits for minority-area developments were\napproved even though the areas had a high concentration of low-\nincome  housing  developments  and  despite  some  board  members’\nobjections.\nConsidering all of this evidence together, the court holds\nthat ICP has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the\npretextual nature of defendants’ proferred justification.  ICP has\npresented some evidence that defendants’ QAP and actual practices\ndo not corroborate their contention that building in qualified\ncensus tracts is a true priority.  Instead, the disproportionate\napproval of units in Caucasian areas when the likely tenants are\nCaucasian allows a reasonable jury to infer that defendants’ reason\nis pretextual.  Because there are genuine issues of material fact,\nthe court denies defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to\nICP’s §§ 1982 and 1983 claims.  \n- 36 -\n\n*     *     *\nICP’s October 2, 2009 motion for partial summary judgment is\ngranted.  Defendants’ October 2, 2009 motion for judgment on the\npleadings and their October 2, 2009 motion for summary judgment are\ndenied.    ICP’s  November  9,  2009  motion  for  leave  to  file\nsupplemental appendix is denied as moot. \nSO ORDERED.\nSeptember 28, 2010.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

(“ICP”)\non its disparate impact claim under §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”),\nthe court now addresses the appropriate remedy for awarding Low Income Housing Tax\nCredits (“LIHTC”) in the Dallas metropolitan area.\nI\nAs directed, defendants Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs and\nits  Executive  Director  and  board  members  in  their  official  capacities  (collectively,\n(“TDHCA”), have submitted a proposed remedial plan (“Plan”).  According to TDHCA,\noperating under the constraints of federal and state law, the Plan does the following:\n\nfocuses on: (1) according proposed developments located in\ndefined high opportunity areas the greatest incentives allowed\nby state law; and, (2) according developments in Qualified\nCensus  Tracts  (QCTs)  that  are  part  of  true  concerted\nrevitalization plans co-equal incentives in order to provide the\npreference created by Internal Revenue Code §42(m).  It is\nenvisioned that the revitalization incentive will set a very high\nthreshold, making it unlikely to yield a number of successful\napplicants  in  QCTs  such  that  would  perpetuate  any\ndiscriminatory patterns found to have occurred unintentionally. \nDs. Plan 4.  The Plan contains the following twelve-points:  \n1.  TDHCA  states  that  Governor  Perry,  in  approving  the  2012 Qualified\nAllocation Plan (“QAP”), determined that forward commitments were not desirable and that\nwaivers should only be granted when “necessary to further a purpose or policy enunciated\nin Tex. Gov’t Code, Chapter 2306.”  Id.\n2.  TDHCA proposes to further strengthen the definition of a high opportunity area\n(“HOA”) by adopting the following “Opportunity Index”:  \n- 2 -\n\nPoints Population Poverty Income Factor School\nServed Factor Quality Factor\n7 General <15% for all Top quartile of median Exemplary or\nindividuals household income for county recognized\nor top quartile for\nMetropolitan Statistical Area\n(“MSA”)\n5 General <15% for all Top 2 quartiles of median Exemplary or\nindividuals household income for county recognized\nor top 2 quartiles for MSA\n5 Any <15% for all Top quartile of median Exemplary or\nindividuals household income for county recognized\nor top quartile for MSA\n3 Any <15% for all Top quartile of median n/a\nindividuals household income for county\nor top quartile for MSA\n1 Any <15% for all Top 2 quartiles of median n/a\nindividuals household income for county\nor top 2 quartiles for MSA\nId. at 6-7. \nTDHCA also suggests adding certain below-the-line criteria, which it maintains are\n“indicative of educational quality and opportunity or lack of affordable housing.”  Id. at 7. \nMoreover, it offers to remove all other “Development Location” options in the below-the-line\ncriterion unless the option is required by statute so that it will maintain high incentives to\ntarget HOAs.\n- 3 -\n\n3.  TDHCA proposes to continue including a 130% basis boost for applications\nproposing development sites located in HOAs.\n4.  In order to effectuate the preference in I.R.C. § 42(m) for developments located\nin QCTs and which contribute to a concerted community revitalization plan, TDHCA\nproposes the following “Revitalization Index”:\nPoints Population Criteria\nServed\n7 Any The proposed development site is located in a QCT\nin which there is in effect a concerted revitalization\nplan consistent with the elements described in § 5\nand the non-housing costs, as reflected in the local\ngovernment certified plan budget, exceed $25,000\nper unit in the proposed development.\n3 Any The proposed development site is located in a QCT\nin which there is in effect a concerted revitalization\nplan consistent with the elements described in § 5\nand the non-housing costs, as reflected in the local\ngovernment certified plan budget, exceed $10,000\nper unit but are less than $25,000 per unit\n2 Any The proposed development site is not located in a\nQCT but there is in effect a concerted\nrevitalization plan consistent with the elements\ndescribed in § 5 and the non-housing costs, as\nreflected in the local government certified plan\nbudget, exceed $10,000 per unit.\nId. at 10-11.  \n5.  TDHCA offers to continue including criteria for disqualifying proposed sites\nthat have undesirable features.  It also proposes to require an applicant to obtain pre-\n- 4 -\n\nclearance if the proposed development is located at or within 1000 feet of certain negative\nsite features.\n6.  In line with the “Revitalization Index,” TDHCA proposes to strengthen the\nrequirements to establish a concerted revitalization plan in order to insure that “true\ncommunity revitalization is occurring.”  Id. at 15. \n7. TDHCA proposes to promulgate by rule a fair housing choice disclosure to\nadvise prospective tenants of alternative housing and fair housing rights.  TDHCA also\nproposes to maintain a website with relevant information. \n8.  TDHCA proposes to conduct an annual analysis, which will be made public,\nof the “effects of its prior QAP to determine if that QAP . . . contribut[es] to a disparate\nimpact[,]” in order to “take appropriate and lawfully permitted measures to amend the next\nand subsequent QAPs . . . to avoid [the] present and potentially developing disparate impact.” \nId. at 18.\n9. TDHCA proposes adding a mechanism to challenge the grounds for public\ncomments that could lead to the negative scoring of 9% applications or constitute opposition\nto proposed 4% developments. Additionally, applications in HOAs receiving statements of\nsupport  or  neutrality  from  a  neighborhood  organization  that  previously  opposed  a\ndevelopment, causing it to lose points, will receive two additional points.  TDHCA must also\namend its debarment rules so that if any applicant attempts to create opposition to an\napplication, they will be subject to debarment.\n- 5 -\n\n10.  TDHCA proposes that “[i]n the event of a tie in scoring, the tie breaker will be\na preference for the developments that are located the greatest distance from the nearest\ndevelopment that is assisted by either 4% or 9% [LIHTCs].”  Id. at 20.  \n11.   TDHCA proposes to “continue to make available on its website proposed and\nfinal QAPs with comments and responses, applications, underwriting reports, application and\naward logs, scoring logs by subject, inventories, and appeal materials.”  Id. at 20.  It also\nproposes to “post market studies, Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and property\ncondition assessments on its website.”  Id. \n12.  TDHCA acknowledges that it is subject to statutory constraints, including \n“adherence to the Texas Administrative Procedures Act; the Texas General Appropriations\nAct; Chapter 2306 of the Texas Government Code; and adherence to various federal\nrequirements regarding the administration of other sources of funding impacting [TDHCA’s]\nability to address such matters.”  Id. at 20.  \nICP and intervenor Frazier Revitalization Inc. (“FRI”) object to components of the \nPlan.1\n1On August 3, 2012 FRI filed a motion for leave to file supplement to objections to\ndefendants’ proposed remedial plan, which the court has granted today.  Although the court\nhas considered the supplement to objections and brief in adopting the remedial plan, because\nnothing in them changes the reasoning or decisions of this memorandum opinion and order,\nthe court will not separately discuss the supplement to objections and brief.\n- 6 -\n\nII\n“Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable\npowers to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable\nremedies.”  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971).  This\npower, however, is not plenary and may be exercised only on the basis of the violation.  See,\ne.g., Dayton v. Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 419-20 (1977); Swann, 402 U.S. at\n16.  The scope of the remedy must be tailored to fit “the nature of the violation” and cannot\nbe “broader than that necessary to remove the violation and its effects.”  Resident Advisory\nBd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 145 (3d Cir. 1977) (quoting Brinkman, 433 U.S. at 419).  “A\nremedy is justifiable only insofar as it advances the ultimate objective of alleviating the\ninitial constitutional violation.”  Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 489 (1992).  Moreover, “the\nfederal courts in devising a remedy must take into account the interests of state and local\nauthorities in managing their own affairs, consistent with the Constitution.”  Spallone v.\nUnited States, 493 U.S. 265, 276 (1990) (quoting Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280-81\n(1977)). \nIt is within the court’s authority to “order[] such affirmative action as may be\nappropriate” in order to remedy a FHA violation.  42 U.S.C. § 3613(c)(1).  “Appropriate\nrelief for violations of the [FHA] is to be determined on a case-by-case basis with relief\ntailored in each instance to the needs of the particular situation.”  United States v. Jamestown\nCenter-in-the-Grove Apartments, 557 F.2d 1079, 1080 (5th Cir. 1977) (citations omitted). \n“Relief should be aimed toward twin goals insuring that no future violations of the [FHA]\n- 7 -\n\noccur and removing any lingering effects of past discrimination.”  See id. (collecting cases). \nIII\nA\nAs proposed by TDHCA, the court adopts by judgment filed today the following\nremedy for TDHCA’s violation of the FHA.  Pending further order of this court, TDHCA\nmust apply the following remedy as to the Dallas metropolitan area in accordance with\nTDHCA’s proposal:2\n1. include in the QAP the additional below-the-line criteria provided by the\n“Opportunity Index”; \n2. include in the QAP the additional below-the-line criteria regarding the quality \nof public education and anti-concentration, and remove all other “Development\n2Although TDHCA functions on a statewide basis, its obligation under this remedy\nextends only to the Dallas metropolitan area because ICP’s disparate impact claim is founded\nsolely on that region.  See Brinkman, 433 U.S. at 420 (“[O]nly if there has been a systemwide\nimpact may there be a systemwide remedy.”); see also Horne v. Glores, 557 U.S. 433, 129\nS.Ct. 2579, 2607 (2009) (because violation was proved only as to single district, vacating\nstatewide injunction to extent it extended beyond district on grounds that “a statewide\ninjunction  .  .  .  intruded  deeply  into  the  State’s  budgetary  processes”  and  “obscured\naccountability for the drastic remedy” since the state legislature or state courts have the\nauthority to decide this issue and not the lower court).  The court concludes that the remedy\nordered by this court does not apply statewide.  Cf. Ds. Plan 19 (“[TDHCA] will endeavor\nto apply the principles and objectives in this Plan on a statewide basis.”).  This does not bar\nTDHCA from following its usual processes to apply this remedy to areas outside of the\nDallas metropolitan area.  The court, however, cannot order a statewide remedy, which\nwould circumvent TDHCA’s usual processes, because it must be careful to minimize federal\nintrusion and to decree a remedy only to the extent it will cure the violation.  See, e.g.,\nBrinkman, 433 U.S. at 420; Jamestown, 557 F.2d at 1081; United States v. W. Peachtree\nTenth Corp., 437 F.2d 221, 228-29 (5th Cir. 1971). \n- 8 -\n\nLocation” criteria set forth;\n3. continue to provide a 130% basis boost for developments in HOAs;\n4. continue  to  include  in  the  QAP  criteria  for  disqualifying  proposed\ndevelopment sites that have undesirable features and incorporate the more\nrobust  process  to  identify  and  address  other  potentially  undesirable  site\nfeatures;\n5. promulgate by rule a fair housing choice disclosure for prospective tenants and\nmaintain a website providing information as to tax-credit assisted properties;\n6.  conduct an annual disparate impact analysis;\n7. provide a mechanism to challenge public comments that cause proposed\ndevelopments to receive negative points and include in the QAP the additional\ntwo-point below-the-line criterion regarding support or neutrality from a\nneighborhood organization that previously opposed a development and an\nassociated debarment rule; and \n8. in the event of a tie in scoring a 9% application, adopt a tie breaker in favor of \nan application proposing development in an HOA.\nB\nTDHCA must also submit an annual report to the court so that the court can evaluate\nwhether, during the reporting period, TDHCA has “insur[ed] that no future violations of the\n[FHA] occur[red] and remov[ed] any lingering effects of past discrimination.”  See id.  \nNo later than 90 days after the date the judgment is filed, the parties must confer\n- 9 -\n\nregarding what information the report should contain.  No later than 120 days after the date\nthe judgment is filed, the parties must make a joint submission to the court stating (1)\nwhether they agree to the contents of the report, and, if they do not agree in all respects to\nthe  contents,  (2)  their  specific  agreements  and  disagreements  and  their  reasons  for\ndisagreement.  The court will then issue an order prescribing the contents of the annual\nreport.\nEach calendar year, no later than 120 days after the TDHCA Board of Directors\n(“Board”) issues final commitments for allocations of LIHTC, TDHCA must file the annual\nreport with the clerk of court.3  Within 30 days of the date TDHCA files the annual report,\nany other party may comment on the report by filing the comments with the clerk of court\nand serving all other parties.  TDHCA may file a reply to a comment no later than 30 days\nafter the comment is filed.  TDHCA may include in an annual report, and another party may\ninclude in a comment, a request to modify a provision of the remedial plan.  The request must\nset forth why the provision is no longer necessary or is insufficient to “insur[e] that no future\nviolations of the [FHA] occur and remov[e] any lingering effects of past discrimination.”  Id.;\nsee also Brown v. Plata, ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 1910, 1946 (2011) (quoting N.Y. State Ass’n\nfor Retarded Children v. Carey, 706 F.2d 956, 967 (2d Cir. 1983)) (“The power of a court\nof equity to modify a decree of injunctive relief is long-established, broad, and flexible.”).\n3Based on Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6724(f) (West 2008), the court anticipates\nthat the 120-day deadline will occur 120 days after July 31 of the calendar year in question. \nIf that date falls on a day when the clerk’s office is closed, the report will be due the next day\nthat the office is open.\n- 10 -\n\nFor the reasons explained infra at § VII, the annual reporting procedure shall remain\nin effect during the period during which the court retains jurisdiction over this case.\nIV\nThe court turns first to the proper interpretation of § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) of the\nInternal Revenue Code (“I.R.C.”), 26 U.S.C. § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III).  FRI objects to the Plan,\ncontending that it violates § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii) by failing to give preference to developments\nthat contribute to a concerted community revitalization plan.  FRI Objs. 3.  And in the Plan,\nTDHCA may be interpreting § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii) to impose a project selection preference.  See\nDs. Plan 15 (stating that “Consistent with § 42(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 2012\nQAP offers incentives for applications in qualified census tracts and for applications in areas\nwhere the housing is a necessary component of a community revitalization plan.”).\nA\nFRI contends that the Plan violates § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii) because it does not give\npreference to developments that are located in QCTs and that contribute to a concerted\ncommunity revitalization plan.  FRI maintains that the Plan fails in several respects to give\npreference to such projects.  First, FRI argues that the most recent QAP already gives\npreference to developments to be located in an HOA rather than to developments focused on\nrevitalization, and that the Plan only strengthens that preference.  FRI contends that this\npreference is in part demonstrated by the fact that, following the most recent QAP, TDHCA\nprovided data showing the “virtual curtailment of QCT [applications].”  FRI Objs. 6 (quoting\n- 11 -\n\nDs. Plan 9).4 Second, FRI argues that TDHCA does not give preference to revitalization\ndevelopments because, in order to curtail revitalization development, it has intentionally\nestablished “high thresholds” that must be met for revitalization developments to qualify for\navailable additional points.  Third, FRI argues that TDHCA’s proposed remedy alters the\nscoring system by making additional points available to HOA developments without making\nsimilar  points  available  to  revitalization  developments,  and  this  demonstrates  that\nrevitalization developments are not given preference by the QAP.  In summary, FRI’s\nobjections are based on concerns that the Plan will significantly decrease the number of\nrevitalization projects that are awarded LIHTC, and FRI contends that such a plan fails to\ngive preference to revitalization projects, in violation of § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii).\nB\nIn  Inclusive  Communities  Project,  Inc.  v.  Texas  Department  of  Housing  and\nCommunity Affairs, 749 F.Supp.2d 486 (N.D. Tex. 2010) (Fitzwater, C.J.), the court held that\nTDHCA had failed to demonstrate that it could not comply with both the FHA and § 42.  Id.\nat 506 n.21.  FRI argues that, despite this conclusion, § 42 governs the allocation of LIHTC\nand the Plan cannot require that TDHCA violate § 42, which FRI maintains the Plan does. \nThe court agrees with FRI that the remedy in this case must comply with both the FHA and\n§ 42.  But the court holds that the Plan can comply with the FHA without violating §\n4TDHCA itself expressed a concern that these data were not consistent with the\nexpressed preferences of Congress set forth in § 42.  This concern was at least one reason\nwhy TDHCA included the revitalization index in its proposed remedy.\n- 12 -\n\n42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III).  This conclusion follows from a correct interpretation of I.R.C. § 42.\n1\nThe “first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue\nhas a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.” \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997).  The court’s “inquiry must cease if the\nstatutory language is unambiguous and ‘the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.’”\nId. (quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 240 (1989); Conn. Nat’l\nBank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992)).  “Unless exceptional circumstances dictate\notherwise, ‘[w]hen [the court] find[s] the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry is\ncomplete.’”  Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Okla. Tax Comm’n, 481 U.S. 454, 461 (1987) (quoting\nRubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430 (1981)).  “The plainness or ambiguity of statutory\nlanguage is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that\nlanguage is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.”  Robinson, 519 U.S. at\n341 (citing Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U.S. 469, 477 (1992); McCarthy\nv. Bronson, 500 U.S. 136, 139 (1991)).\n2\nLIHTC are a type of general business credit.  See I.R.C. § 38(b)(5).  Section 42 sets\nforth the eligibility requirements for those seeking LIHTC, the method for calculating the\namount of the credit, and the requirements of state housing agencies, such as TDHCA, in\nallocating their state’s LIHTC.  One such requirement is that state housing agencies must\nallocate all LIHTC dollar amounts pursuant to a QAP.  See I.R.C. § 42(m)(1)(A)(i).  Under\n- 13 -\n\nI.R.C. § 42(m)(1)(B), a QAP\nmeans any plan—\n(i) which sets forth selection criteria to be used to determine housing\npriorities of the housing credit agency which are appropriate to local\nconditions, \n(ii) which also gives preference in allocating housing credit dollar\namounts among selected projects to—\n(I) projects serving the lowest income tenants, \n(II) projects obligated to serve qualified tenants for the longest\nperiods, and \n(III) projects which are located in qualified census tracts (as\ndefined in subsection (d)(5)(C)) and the development of which\ncontributes to a concerted community revitalization plan, and \n(iii) which provides a procedure that the agency (or an agent or other\nprivate  contractor  of  such  agency)  will  follow  in  monitoring  for\nnoncompliance with the provisions of this section and in notifying the\nInternal Revenue Service of such noncompliance which such agency\nbecomes  aware  of  and  in  monitoring  for  noncompliance  with\nhabitability standards through regular site visits.\nI.R.C. § 42(m)(1)(B).\nBoth Frazier and TDHCA interpret § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) as requiring TDHCA to give\npreference  to  projects  located  in  QCTs  that  contribute  to  a  concerted  community\nrevitalization  plan  by  providing  such  projects  with  additional  points  in  the  QAP’s\ncompetitive scoring system.  But § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) requires that the QAP “give[]\npreference in allocating housing credit dollar amounts among selected projects to— . . .\nprojects which are located in qualified census tracts (as defined in subsection (d)(5)(C)) and\nthe development of which contributes to a concerted community revitalization plan[.]”  Id.\nat § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) (emphasis added).  The dictionary definition of “selected” is\n“[s]ingled out in preference: chosen.”  Webster’s II New Riverside University Dictionary\n- 14 -\n\n1057 (1984).5 Because “selected” is in the past tense, the statute mandates that the preference\ngiven to QCTs in allocating LIHTC dollar amounts occur after the projects have been\nselected.  In other words, § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) does not require that the QAP award\nadditional points so that projects located in QCTs and the development of which contribute\nto a concerted community revitalization plan are preferred over other projects.6  Instead, §\n42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) provides that, after projects have been selected,  projects located in\nQCTs, and the development of which contributes to a concerted community revitalization\nplan, must be given preference in allocating LIHTC dollar amounts among the projects that \nhave already been selected.  \nThis interpretation of § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) is supported by § 42(m)(1)(C), which\nspecifies selection criteria that a QAP must include.  One selection criterion is the “project\ncharacteristics, including whether the project includes the use of existing housing as part of\na community revitalization plan.”  Id. at § 42(m)(1)(C)(iii).7  The inclusion of this criterion\nas one of several criteria confirms that Congress only intended revitalization projects that\ninclude the use of existing housing as part of a community revitalization plan to be one factor\n5“When a term goes undefined in a statute, [it is given] its ordinary meaning.” \nTaniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., ___ U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 1997, 2002 (2012) (citing\nAsgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179, 187 (1995)) (using dictionaries to aid\nstatutory interpretation). \n6Subject, at least, to the requirements of the FHA, a QAP can award additional points\nto revitalization projects, but § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) does not require that the QAP do so.\n7This is the only mandatory criterion related to revitalization, and TDHCA’s 2012-13\nQAP complies with this requirement.\n- 15 -\n\nin the selection process, not a dispositive or preferred one.  Congress could have, but did not,\nrequire that a QAP effectively prefer revitalization projects in QCTs by including that\nrequirement in § 42(m)(1)(C).  Accordingly, under a correct interpretation of the statute, the\npreference mandated by § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) comes into play after projects are selected and\nwhen LIHTC dollar amounts are being allocated among selected projects.8\nThe court recognizes that, due to the LIHTC selection system adopted in the state of\nTexas and implemented in the Texas QAP, only in rare circumstances will proposed\ndevelopments in QCTs benefit from the preference set forth in § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii).  This is\nbecause TDHCA only selects projects for which it has sufficient LIHTC to allocate.9  When\na developer applies for LIHTC, TDHCA staff (“Staff”) first ensures that the application\nsatisfies  the  threshold  criteria  set  forth  in  the  QAP.    See  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  Ann.  §\n2306.6710(a) (West 2008).  The Staff then scores and ranks the applications that meet the\nthreshold criteria according to the detailed scoring system that the QAP prescribes.  See id.\n§ 2306.6710(b).  Beginning with the highest scoring applications, the Staff underwrites\nenough projects to ensure that all LIHTC will be allocated, including by underwriting\nprojects that the Board places on the waiting list.  See id. § 2306.6710(d).  After the Staff\n8FRI also relies on § 42(d)(5)(B)(i) and (ii) as evidence of Congressional intent to give\npreference during the selection process to developments in QCTs.  The court disagrees. \nThese provisions make eligible for additional tax deductions (by increasing the property’s\nbasis)  developments in QCTs that have been selected to receive LIHTC.  See id.  \n9The court notes that TDHCA’s scoring and ranking system only applies to 9%\nLIHTC.  Applicants seeking 4% LIHTC are not subject to the scoring and ranking process\nthat the court describes in this section. \n- 16 -\n\nmakes its recommendations, the Board selects the projects that will receive a LIHTC\ncommitment notice.  If all of the available LIHTC are committed, the Board creates a waiting\nlist that identifies which applicants will receive any additional LIHTC that become available.\nIf an applicant who receives a commitment notice complies with the remaining obligations\nin the QAP, it will receive its LIHTC allocation.  Therefore, under the QAP, every project\nthat the Board selects is typically allocated LIHTC, meaning there is no opportunity for\nTDHCA to grant projects located in QCTs a “preference in allocating housing credit dollar\namounts among selected projects,” since every project selected by the Board is allocated the\nfull amount of available LIHTC.\nThe court’s interpretation of § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) does not necessarily nullify in\nTexas the preference that the I.R.C. mandates.  Although Texas’ method for distributing\nLIHTC rarely,10 if ever, would require that the preference mandated by § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) \naffect the distribution of LIHTC among the selected projects, § 42 governs every state’s\nhousing  agency.    A  state  could  adopt  a  system  in  which  it  selected  more  proposed\ndevelopments to receive LIHTC than it had available credits.  If that were the case, the state\nagency would be required to give preference to projects covered by § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III). \nSuch projects would be funded preferentially.  Texas, however, has adopted a system in\n10The court notes that if TDHCA selected more projects than it could allocate LIHTC\nto, it would be required to allocate the LIHTC dollar amounts in accordance with §\n42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III).\n- 17 -\n\nwhich projects are not selected if they are unlikely to receive LIHTC.11\nBecause the TDHCA Plan only changes how projects are selected and does not alter\nhow LIHTC dollar amounts are allocated “among selected projects,” TDHCA’s proposed\nremedy does not violate § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III).  Accordingly, the court holds that FRI’s\nobjections lack force.12\nV\nThe court now turns to the TDHCA Plan and the parties’ objections.\nA\nTDHCA begins its proposal with a statement regarding its discretion, as it pertains to\nforward commitments and waivers:\nIn approving the 2012 QAP, Governor Perry determined that the\ncontinuation  of  the  ability  to  make  awards  of  forward\ncommitments  was  not  desirable  and  that  in  exercising  its\ndiscretion to waive any aspect of the QAP the Board should only\ngrant waivers when doing so was necessary to further a purpose\nor policy enunciated in Tex. Gov’t. Code, Chapter 2306.\nDs. Plan 5.  In other words, TDHCA does not propose a remedy; instead, it describes the\n11The court has no occasion in this case to determine whether, because Texas law and\nthe QAP effectively foreclose TDHCA from having to consider the preference mandated by\n§ 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III), Texas law is in tension with the I.R.C., but, to the extent that they are\nin tension, federal law is paramount.\n12Because  FRI’s  objections  are  based  on  an  incorrect  interpretation  of\n§ 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III), the court need not reach FRI’s argument that the Plan is so vague that\nFRI and its experts have not had a meaningful opportunity to evaluate the proposed remedy. \nEven if FRI’s experts were given additional time, FRI could not demonstrate that the remedy\nviolates § 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) because FRI only challenges how LIHTC developments are\nselected rather than how LIHTC dollar amounts are allocated among selected projects.\n- 18 -\n\nnature of the QAP as it now stands.  ICP contends that “TDHCA can and should use its\ndiscretion to remedy the violation.”  P. Obj. 13.  In particular, it proposes that TDHCA use\n“its discretion in making allocation decisions that accomplish the remedial purpose of the\nplan.”  Id.  \nIt is within the court’s authority to “order[] such affirmative action as may be\nappropriate” in order to remedy a FHA violation.  42 U.S.C. § 3613(c)(1).  The court declines\nat this time, however, to require that the QAP be amended to authorize TDHCA to award\nforward commitments and waivers.  Such a mandate would interfere with Texas’ regulation\nof its own affairs.  See, e.g., Spallone, 493 U.S. at 276 (“[T]he federal courts in devising a\nremedy must take into account the interests of state and local authorities in managing their\nown affairs, consistent with the Constitution.”) (alteration in original) (quoting Milliken, 433\nU.S. at 280-81).  And although the court is authorized to impose such a requirement—even\none that interferes with Texas’ regulation of its own affairs—if necessary to remedy the FHA\nviolation, it is presently unclear whether such a remedy would have this effect.  See Rizzo,\n564 F.2d at 145 (prohibiting remedies that are “broader than that necessary to remove the\nviolation and its effects”).  As stated above, the court retains the authority to approve\namendments to the remedial plan after receiving TDHCA’s report and the parties’ proposals. \nThe court can determine later whether it is necessary to empower TDHCA to award forward\ncommitments and waivers to remedy the disparate impact.\n- 19 -\n\nB\nTDHCA proposes to further strengthen the definition of an HOA.  It posits that, in the\n2012 QAP, HOA was defined to require “a development [to] be in a census tract that has\nBOTH a low incidence of poverty AND an above median income as well as . . . located in\nan area served by either recognized elementary schools or having a significant and accessible\nelement of public transportation.”  Ds. Plan 5-6.  It now proposes “to strengthen the criteria\nfor locating developments within HOAs” by adopting the following “Opportunity Index”:\nPoints Population Poverty Factor Income Factor School\nServed Quality Factor\n7 General <15% for all Top quartile of median Exemplary or\nindividuals household income for recognized\ncounty or top quartile for\nMSA\n5 General <15% for all Top 2 quartiles of median Exemplary or\nindividuals household income for recognized\ncounty or top 2 quartiles for\nMSA\n5 Any <15% for all Top quartile of median Exemplary or\nindividuals household income for recognized\ncounty or top quartile for\nMSA\n3 Any <15% for all Top quartile of median n/a\nindividuals household income for\ncounty or top quartile for\nMSA\n1 Any <15% for all Top 2 quartiles of median n/a\nindividuals household income for\ncounty or top 2 quartiles for\nMSA\n- 20 -\n\nId. at 6.  In the first line, a proposed project located in such a census tract will receive the\nhighest number of points a below-the-line criterion may receive—here, 7 points.  An\napplication located in an area that does not meet the stringent requirements of the first line\nmay still receive points, to a lesser degree, if it satisfies the requirements of another line. \nICP does not object to the definition of HOAs or to the “Opportunity Index” to the\nextent that it provides “the highest value possible for below the line points for family units\nlocated in [HOAs].”  P. Obj. 3.  It posits that, to the extent the “Opportunity Index” offers\n1 to 3 points, it is insubstantial and is “unlikely to have any remedial effect” because “[t]hese\nare minor points and have not worked to boost 9% program point totals in the past.”  Id. at\n16.  In support, ICP cites the Talton Report for the proposition that “the use of preference\npoints for higher income areas has a ‘tendency to create more local opposition’ and have only\na ‘limited effect on a development’s completed score.’”  Id. at 17.  It also “object[s] to the\ninclusion of applications for elderly units” in the “Opportunity Index” because “additional\npoints for the elderly restricted units . . . will not have any remedial effects and should not\nbe part of the remedial plan.”13  P. Obj. 16; P. App. 3.  \n13ICP also objects to including points in the “Opportunity Index” for proposed\ndevelopment sites in QCTs for which there is a concerted revitalization plan.  It appears,\nhowever,  that  these  points  are  not  offered  in  the  “Opportunity  Index”  but  in  the\n“Revitalization Index,” which the court discusses infra at § V(E). \nICP also contends that this proposal is insufficient because a “proposed plan that only\nadds below the line criteria and points to the current system will not bring the allocation\nprocess into compliance.”  P. Obj. 21.  ICP asserts that the points should be revalued so that\nthe HOA criterion will have a higher value in comparison to the other criteria. The court\naddresses this infra at § VI.\n- 21 -\n\nThe court adopts the TDHCA Plan’s proposed “Opportunity Index,” and overrules\nICP’s objections.  As stated supra at § V(A), the court is authorized to adopt amendments\nto the remedial plan after receiving TDHCA’s report and the parties’ proposals.  The court\ncan  determine  later  whether  it  is  necessary  to  increase  certain  points  offered  in  the\n“Opportunity Index”14or to limit the index only to elderly units in order to reduce the\ndisparate impact.  \nC\nTDHCA proposes the addition of the following below-the-line criteria, which it\nasserts are “indicative of educational quality and opportunity or lack of affordable housing”:\na. Location within the attendance zone of a public school with\nan  academic  rating  of  “Recognized”  or  “Exemplary”  (or\ncomparable rating) by the Texas Education Agency (up to 3\npoints):\nA. 1 points if it is both an elementary school, and either\na middle school or high school; or\nB. 3 points if it is an elementary school, a middle school,\nand a high school.\nb.  A  municipality  or,  if  outside  of  the  boundaries  of  any\nmunicipality, a county that has never received a competitive tax\ncredit allocation. The application must also comply with all\nother  anti-concentration  provisions  (2  points  for  general\nuse/family or supportive housing; 1 point for elderly).\nDs. Plan 7-8.  TDHCA also offers to remove all other “Development Location”  options in\nthe below-the-line criterion, unless required by statute, in order to preserve high incentives\n14Moreover, while ICP maintains that the proposed 1 to 3 points are insubstantial, its\nargument and evidence do not demonstrate that 1 or 3 points will not reduce the disparate\nimpact, albeit perhaps by a lesser extent.\n- 22 -\n\nto target HOAs.  ICP does not object to these proposals.  Accordingly, the court adopts them\nas part of the remedy. \nD\nTDHCA next states that, because the 2012 QAP offers a 130% basis boost for\nproposed development sites located in HOAs, it will continue to do so.  ICP supports this\nproposal but asserts that the basis boost should be limited to non-elderly units because “[t]he\nprovision of the 130% basis boost for elderly and supportive housing will not remedy the\nviolation of disproportionately allocating non-elderly units to locations in predominantly\nminority areas.”  P. Obj. 14.\nFor the reasons stated supra at § V(B), the court overrules ICP’s objection.  \n- 23 -\n\nE\nTDHCA next proposes the adoption of the following “Revitalization Index”:\nPoints Population Criteria\nServed\n7 Any The proposed development site is located in a QCT\nin which there is in effect a concerted revitalization\nplan consistent with the elements described in § 5\nand the non-housing costs, as reflected in the local\ngovernment certified plan budget, exceed $25,000\nper unit in the proposed development.\n3 Any The proposed development site is located in a QCT\nin which there is in effect a concerted revitalization\nplan consistent with the elements described in § 5\nand the non-housing costs, as reflected in the local\ngovernment certified plan budget, exceed $10,000\nper unit but are less than $25,000 per unit\n2 Any The proposed development site is not located in a\nQCT but there is in effect a concerted\nrevitalization plan consistent with the elements\ndescribed in § 5 and the non-housing costs, as\nreflected in the local government certified plan\nbudget, exceed $10,000 per unit.\nDs. Plan 10-11.  According to TDHCA, the failure to grant the same preference provided to\nHOAs by the “Opportunity Index” to revitalization projects in QCTs is inconsistent with the\npreference for revitalization projects set forth in I.R.C. § 42(m). \nICP objects to the inclusion of the “Revitalization Index” for several reasons.  First,\nit argues that, even according to TDHCA, the purpose of the “Revitalization Index” is not\nto remedy the FHA violation but to comply with § 42(m).  ICP therefore maintains that the\n- 24 -\n\ninclusion of the “Revitalization Index” in the remedy is improper because it makes the\nremedy broader than necessary to address the violation.  The court has already held that §\n42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III) does not require TDHCA to give preference to revitalization projects in\nQCTs when selecting which projects will receive LIHTC; thus TDHCA need not include the\n“Revitalization Index” in the scoring system to comply with § 42(m).  If the “Revitalization\nIndex” need not be included to comply with the I.R.C., there is no reason for the court to\nmake it part of the FHA remedy.  TDHCA, in fact, does not argue that the “Revitalization\nIndex” is a necessary component of a plan to ameliorate the FHA violation, and ICP contends\nthat the “Revitalization Index” may actually undercut the remedy that the court imposes. \nBecause the “Revitalization Index” is not required by the I.R.C. and there has been no\nshowing that it is a necessary component of a plan to remedy the FHA violation, its inclusion\nis impermissible because it will make the court’s remedy broader than necessary.  See Rizzo,\n564 F.2d at 145 (holding that scope of remedy must be tailored to fit “the nature of the\nviolation” and cannot be “broader than that necessary to remove the violation and its\neffects”).15  Accordingly, the court declines to include the “Revitalization Index” in the\nremedy.16\n15Because the court is not including the “Revitalization Index” in the remedy, it need\nnot address ICP’s other arguments related to the “Revitalization Index.”\n16As discussed supra at note 2, this does not preclude TDHCA from following its\nusual processes to include the “Revitalization Index” in the QAP.\n- 25 -\n\nF\nTDHCA proposes to strengthen the criteria for disqualifying proposed development\nsites that have undesirable features.  It states that the 2012 QAP “included criteria for\ndisqualifying proposed sites that have undesirable features,” such as “developments located\nadjacent to or within 300 feet of junkyards.”  Ds. Plan 11-12.  And it represents that it “will\ncontinue to include the same or similar criteria in its QAPs.”  Id. at 13.  ICP does not object\nto this component of the Plan, stating that “[r]estricting the availability of such sites may\nhave a remedial effect.”  P. Obj. 23.  The court adopts this proposal as part of the remedy. \nTDHCA also proposes to “incorporate a more robust process to identify and address\nother potentially undesirable site features” by requiring “an applicant proposing development\nof multifamily housing with tax credits [to] disclose to [TDHCA] and . . . obtain [TDHCA’s]\nwritten notification of pre-clearance if the site involves any negative site features,” such as\n“significant or recurring flooding,” “ at . . . or within 1000 feet of the proposed site.”  Ds.\nPlan 13.  TDHCA will then determine whether to issue or withhold preclearance by\nreviewing the matters disclosed and conducting a site inspection, if necessary.  ICP argues\nthat “the use of a 1,000 feet distance as the primary measure for the ineligibility of a site\nunder the criteria” is an inadequate measure of risk.  P. App. 3.  ICP maintains, instead, that\n“[t]he analysis should be on whether the condition poses such risk.”  P. Obj. 23-24.  For the\nreasons stated supra at § V(B), the court overrules ICP’s objection.  \n- 26 -\n\nG\nTDHCA next proposes strengthening the requirements for establishing a concerted\nrevitalization plan in order to ensure that “true community revitalization is occurring.”  Ds.\nPlan 15.  Under the proposal, TDHCA can determine at a public meeting that a plan\nsubstantively and meaningfully demonstrates a revitalization effort, even if one or more\nfactors have not been met.  \nTDHCA includes this in the remedial plan in an attempt to be consistent with its view\nof the requirements of I.R.C. § 42(m).  ICP objects to including these enhancements as part\nof the remedial plan.  For the reasons stated supra at § IV, TDHCA has no legal obligation\nunder § 42(m) to give a preference to revitalization developments when selecting which\nprojects will receive LIHTC.  Because TDHCA does not contend that this proposal is\nnecessary to remedy the FHA violation, the court concludes that the proposed revitalization\nenhancement is “broader than that necessary to remove the violation and its effects.”  Rizzo,\n564 F.2d at 145.  Accordingly, the court declines to include in the remedy the point\nenhancements for developments that are part of a concerted community revitalization effort\nin the remedy.17\n17As discussed supra at notes 2 and 16, this does not preclude TDHCA from following\nits usual processes to include such enhancements in the QAP.\n- 27 -\n\nH\nTDHCA proposes to “promulgate by rule a fair housing disclosure . . ., advising\nprospective tenants in writing of a website or other method of contact where they can obtain\ninformation about alternative housing and their rights under fair housing laws.”  Ds. Plan 18. \nUnder the Plan, this disclosure must be provided to prospective tenants before they can enter\ninto a lease.  TDHCA also proposes to “maintain a website providing relevant information\nand identifying tax credit assisted properties.”  Id. \nICP posits that the disclosure and website “will not affect TDHCA’s allocation\ndecisions and will not contribute to bringing those decisions into compliance with the\n[FHA].”  P. Obj. 24.  But it acknowledges that “some form of . . . notice that would be\ntailored for use in the Dallas remedial area would be appropriate once there are more tax\ncredit units in Caucasian areas.”  Id.  ICP suggests that the parties together determine the\ncontent of the notice.\nThe court disagrees with ICP’s position that the disclosure and website will not reduce\nthe disparate impact.  Such initiatives could increase demand by tenants for developments\nlocated in HOAs, which could, in turn, encourage developers to propose such developments,\nand which then could result in increased approval rates for non-elderly developments located\nin predominantly Caucasian neighborhoods.  The court adopts TDHCA’s proposal.  The\ncontent of the disclosure will be subject to periodic review as are the other provisions of the\nPlan.\n- 28 -\n\n I\nTDHCA proposes to “annually conduct an analysis of the effects of its prior QAP to\ndetermine if that QAP . . . contribut[es] to disparate impact.”  Ds. Plan 18.  ICP does not\nobject to an annual disparate impact analysis, and the court adopts the proposal as an\nefficacious method of monitoring whether the court-ordered remedy is ensuring that no\nfuture violations of the FHA occur and removing any lingering effects of past discrimination. \nSee Jamestown, 557 F.2d at 1080 (collecting cases).18\nJ\nTDHCA proposes adding a mechanism to challenge the grounds for public comments\nthat could lead to the negative scoring of 9% applications or constitute opposition to\nproposed 4% developments.  Under the proposal, a party challenging a comment must state\nthe basis for the challenge.  The commenting party must then provide support for the\n18ICP contests the use of “over-concentration” in TDHCA’s heading, which states:\n“Annual analysis of effectiveness of plan and continued development and enhancement of\na policy of avoidance of over-concentration of [LIHTC].”  Ds. Plan 18.  ICP asserts that\n“[a]ny analysis using . . . concentration and over-concentration will not assist in bringing\nTDHCA’s allocation decisions into compliance with the [FHA].”  P. Obj. 22.  Instead, ICP\nmaintains that the analysis should focus, not on concentration, but on disparate racial impact. \nAlthough the heading refers to the “over-concentration” of LIHTC, the content of\nTDHCA’s proposal demonstrates that its focus is on disparate impact, given that TDHCA\nintends to examine the extent that its changes reduce the disparate impact and whether it is\nnecessary to adopt additional changes.  Moreover, after the court receives the annual report\nand any requested modifications to the remedial plan, it will review under court-approved\nprocedures all relevant evidence to determine whether the remedial plan should be amended. \nIf  information  as  to  over-concentration  is  relevant,  TDHCA  can  present  it  for  court\nconsideration.  \nICP also requests that the annual report be used to request the court for modifications\nto the remedial plan.  The court has established these procedures supra at § III.\n- 29 -\n\naccuracy of its comment.  A fact finder from TDHCA will make a final determination on the\nvalidity of the challenge.  ICP does not object to this proposal.  Because this proposal could\noffer an applicant proposing a development located in an HOA a manner to challenge\nnegative comments, the court adopts the proposal.\nTDHCA also proposes that applications in HOAs receiving statements of support or\nneutrality from a neighborhood organization that previously opposed a development (thus\ncausing it to lose points) receive two additional points.  ICP objects to including these points\nin the remedy but does not justify its opposition.  Because this proposal could assist an\napplicant proposing a development in an HOA, the court adopts it as part of the remedy.\nFinally, TDHCA proposes to amend its debarment rules so that if an applicant\nattempts to create opposition to an application, it will be subject to debarment.  ICP objects\nto including new debarment rules in the remedy, arguing that debarment and the actions that\ncould lead to it are not related, and therefore not tailored, to the FHA violation.  The court\ndisagrees, concluding that the proposed debarment rule could decrease impediments to\napplications for developments in HOAs.  \nK\nTDHCA proposes that “[i]n the event of a tie in scoring, the tie breaker will be a\npreference for the developments that are located the greatest distance from the nearest\ndevelopment that is assisted by either 4% or 9% credits.”  Ds. Plan 20.  ICP objects to this\nproposal.  Similar to its argument above, ICP asserts that “[t]he use of distance alone is a\nTDHCA concentration policy,” which does not address the disparate impact violation.  P.\n- 30 -\n\nObj. 31.  Instead, it posits that the tie breaker should be in favor of “[a]n application for a\nfamily unit development in [an HOA] which would be consistent with . . . the [FHA].”  Id.\nat 31-32.  The court adopts ICP’s proposal, concluding that it appears better tailored to\nreducing the disparate impact.\nL\nTDHCA proposes to “continue to make available on its website proposed and final\nQAPs with comments and responses, applications, underwriting reports, application and\naward logs, scoring logs by subject, inventories, and appeal materials.”  Ds. Plan 20.  It also\nproposes to “post market studies, Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and property\ncondition assessments on its website.”  Id.  ICP does not object to this proposal, and it posits\nthat the website could also offer “other documents necessary to monitor compliance with the\nCourt ordered plan.”  P. Obj. 25.\nThe parties do not address, and the court cannot determine, how this proposal is \nintended to ensure that no future violations of the FHA occur or to remove any lingering\neffects  of  past  discrimination.    See  Jamestown,  557  F.2d  at  1080  (collecting  cases). \nAccordingly, the court declines to include this proposal, concluding that it is outside the\nscope of the court’s remedial power.  See Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 145.19 \n19TDHCA is not precluded from implementing this proposal after following its usual\nprocesses.  See supra at notes 2, 16, and 17.\n- 31 -\n\nM\nFinally, TDHCA states that it is subject to statutory constraints, including “adherence\nto the Texas Administrative Procedures Act; the Texas General Appropriations Act; Chapter\n2306 of the Texas Government Code; and adherence to various federal requirements\nregarding the administration of other sources of funding impacting [TDHCA’s] ability to\naddress such matters.”  Ds. Plan 20.  ICP interprets this to be a proposal “that [the] court\norder[] compliance with state and federal law,” asserts that this proposal has no “connection\nto the [FHA] violation or the appropriate remedy,” and posits that “there is no basis for a\nCourt order to require compliance with state and federal laws governing the general\nadministration of the program.”  P. Obj. 32. \nTDHCA does not appear to be offering a proposal.  Instead, TDHCA’s statement\nappears to reflect its position that it is subject to statutory restrictions derived from state and\nfederal law.  But 42 U.S.C. § 3615 states that “any law of a State, a political subdivision, or\nother such jurisdiction that purports to require or permit any action that would be a\ndiscriminatory housing practice under this subchapter shall to that extent be invalid.”  Id. \nAnd TDHCA does not specify the federal laws on which it relies.  The court therefore\ndeclines to include this proposal in the remedial plan.\nVI\nThe court now turns to ICP’s proposals.  ICP asserts that “TDHCA has proposed no\nchanges in the 4% program allocation and decision process.”  P. Obj. 33.  The court\nrecognizes that the Plan does not address 4% LIHTC specifically, but ICP’s objection does\n- 32 -\n\nnot identify a specific deficiency in the remedial plan that results from this omission.  There\nare distinctions between 4% and 9% LIHTC in that 4% LIHTC are available to all who\nqualify.  Additionally, parts of the remedial plan would have the effect of promoting 4%\nLIHTC in predominantly Caucasian areas (e.g., criteria for disqualifying proposed sites with\nundesirable features).  Accordingly, the court will consider the adequacy of the remedial plan\nin relation to 4% LIHTC as part of its annual review process.  \nICP next contends that, although TDHCA suggests one change to its threshold\ncriteria—the  exclusion  of  proposed  development  sites  that  have  undesirable\nfeatures—TDHCA should propose additional amendments to the threshold criteria in order\nto mitigate the disparate impact.  ICP also proposes revaluing points to increase the weight\nof below-the-line criteria, especially criteria that would reduce the disparate impact.  The\ncourt agrees that these changes could reduce the disparate impact, but it is unclear whether\ntheir adoption is necessary to reduce the disparate impact.  The court will instead consider\nthese proposals as part of its annual review process.  \n  ICP also asserts that the use of TDHCA’s discretion should be included in the\nremedial plan.  The court has already declined to accept this argument.\nVII\nIn the judgment filed today, the court implements the remedial plan adopted in this\nmemorandum opinion and order and retains jurisdiction over this case for a period of five\nyears after the first annual report is filed.  Although no party moves for a temporal limit on\nthe court-ordered remedy, the court concludes that one is necessary.  See, e.g., Ueno v.\n- 33 -\n\nNapolitano, 2007 WL 1395517, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. May 11, 2007), rec. adopted, (E.D.N.Y.\nMay 11, 2007) (although plaintiffs did not state a time-limit for injunctive relief, adopting\na three-year limitation period because otherwise, “the court would be overseeing the\ndefendants’ rental activities for the rest of their lives”).  The court, in its discretion, adopts\na five-year limitation period.  Cf. United States v. Real Estate One, Inc., 433 F. Supp. 1140,\n1156 (E.D. Mich. 1977) (ordering that defendants provide annual reports detailing manner\nin which they had complied with judgment and directing that “[t]he reporting aspects of the\ninjunction may terminate after five (5) full years of substantial compliance with the terms\nhereof”).  The court finds that such a period will be sufficient to “insur[e] that no future\nviolations of the [FHA] occur and remov[e] any lingering effects of past discrimination.”  See\nJamestown, 557 F.2d at 1080 (collecting cases); see also Ueno, 2007 WL 1395517, at *6\n(adopting three-year limitation period because, inter alia, it “should . . . be enough time to\nmonitor the defendants’ rental practices to ensure that they are not discriminatory, while\nlimiting the burden imposed upon the court as well as the defendants by the imposition of\ninjunctive relief”); Rogers v. 66-36 Yellowstone Blvd. Coop. Owners, Inc., 599 F. Supp. 79,\n85-86 (E.D.N.Y. 1984) (recognizing that two years was best suited for advancement towards\nthese two goals);  Williamsburg Fair Hous. Comm. v. N.Y. City Hous. Auth., 493 F. Supp.\n1225, 1251 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (holding that court had “duty to render a decree which will so\nfar  as  possible  eliminate  the  discriminatory  effects  of  the  past  as  well  as  bar  like\ndiscrimination in the future”) (quoting Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 154 (1965)).\nThe court finds that a five-year period is necessary because progress toward ensuring\n- 34 -\n\nthat no future violations of the FHA occur and of removing any lingering effects of past\ndiscrimination will be measured according to reports of LIHTC awards that (as to 9% tax\ncredits) are made on an annual cycle.  And because various factors can influence where\napplicants choose to develop projects in a particular annual cycle, the court must have a\nsufficiently broad empirical basis to enable it to assess whether the FHA violation in this case\nhas in fact been remedied.  By retaining jurisdiction for five years, the court will be able to\nevaluate the impact of several QAPs on the allocation of LIHTC.  Cf. Rogers, 599 F. Supp.\nat 85-86 (recognizing that one-year duration for injunctive order would not be sufficient to\npermit a “newly implanted open housing program to take root”).  During this period, the\nparties will have opportunities to request modifications to the remedial plan.  This will enable\nthe court to reduce TDHCA’s remedial obligations in fewer than five years if they are no\nlonger warranted, or to increase the remedial requirements in the plan now adopted that do\nhave the intended effect of ensuring that no future violations of the FHA occur and  removing\nany lingering effects of past discrimination.\n*     *     *\nFor the reasons explained, the court adopts in part TDHCA’s Plan, and it enters\njudgment today in accordance with its memorandum opinions and orders in this case and the \n- 35 -\n\nremedial plan adopted today. \nSO ORDERED. \nAugust 7, 2012.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

INCLUSIVE \n\nCOMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC., ET  AL. \n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 13–1371.  Argued January 21, 2015—Decided June 25, 2015  \nThe Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that \nare distributed to developers by designated state agencies.  In Texas, \nthe Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department) \ndistributes  the  credits.    The  Inclusive Communities   Project,  Inc. \n(ICP), a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income \nfamilies in obtaining affordable housing, brought a disparate-impact \nclaim under §§804(a) and 805(a) of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), al-\nleging that the Department and its officers had caused continued \nsegregated housing patterns by  allocating too many tax credits to \nhousing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in pre-\ndominantly white suburban  neighborhoods.  Relying on statistical ev-\nidence, the District Court concluded that the ICP had established a  \nprima facie showing of disparate impact.  After assuming the De-\npartment’s proffered non-discriminatory interests were valid, it found \nthat the Department failed to meet its burden to show that there \nwere no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating the tax credits.  \nWhile the Department’s appeal was pending, the Secretary of Hous-\ning and Urban Development issued a regulation interpreting the \nFHA to encompass disparate-impact liability and establishing a bur-\nden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit held that  disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA, \nbut reversed and remanded on the merits, concluding that, in light of \nthe new regulation, the District Court had improperly required the \nDepartment to prove less discriminatory alternatives.  \n    The FHA was adopted shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr.  Recognizing that persistent racial  segregation had \n \n\n2  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nSyllabus \n \nleft predominantly black inner cities surrounded by mostly white \nsuburbs, the Act addresses the denial of housing opportunities on the \nbasis of “race, color, religion, or national origin.”  In 1988, Congress \namended the FHA, and, as  relevant here, created certain exemptions \nfrom liability. \nHeld: Disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing \nAct.  Pp. 7–24.\n  (a) Two antidiscrimination statutes that preceded the FHA are rel-\nevant to its interpretation.  Both §703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and §4(a)(2) of the Age Discrimination in Em-\nployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) authorize disparate-impact claims.  \nUnder Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, and Smith v.  City of \nJackson, 544 U. S. 228, the cases announcing the rule for Title VII \nand for the ADEA, respectively, antidiscrimination laws should be \nconstrued to encompass disparate-impact claims when their text re-\nfers to the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset of ac-\ntors, and where that interpretation is consistent with statutory pur-\npose.  Disparate-impact liability must be limited so employers and  \nother  regulated  entities  are  able  to  make  the  practical  business \nchoices and profit-related decisions that sustain the free-enterprise \nsystem.  Before rejecting a business justification—or a governmental  \nentity’s analogous public interest—a court must determine that a \nplaintiff has shown that there is “an available alternative . . . practice \nthat has less disparate impact and serves the [entity’s] legitimate  \nneeds.”  Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 578.  These cases provide \nessential background and instruction in the case at issue. Pp. 7–10.\n  (b) Under the FHA it is unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent . . . or \notherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to a person because \nof race” or other protected characteristic, §804(a), or “to discriminate \nagainst any person in” making certain real-estate transactions “be-\ncause of race” or other protected characteristic, §805(a).  The logic of \nGriggs and Smith  provides  strong support for the conclusion that the \nFHA  encompasses  disparate-impact  claims.    The  results-oriented \nphrase “otherwise make unavailable” refers to the consequences of an \naction rather than the actor’s intent.  See  United States v. Giles, 300  \nU. S. 41, 48.  And  this phrase is equivalent in function and purpose to \nTitle VII’s and the ADEA’s “otherwise adversely affect” language.  In \nall three statutes the operative text looks to results  and plays an \nidentical role: as a catchall phrase, located at the end of a lengthy \nsentence that begins with prohibitions on disparate treatment.  The  \nintroductory  word “otherwise” also signals a shift in emphasis from  \nan actor’s intent to the consequences of his actions.  This similarity in \ntext and structure is even more compelling because Congress passed \nthe FHA only four years after Title VII  and four months after the  \n \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nADEA.  Although the FHA does not reiterate Title VII’s exact lan-\nguage, Congress chose words that serve the same purpose and bear \nthe same basic meaning but are consistent with the FHA’s structure \nand objectives.  The FHA contains the phrase “because of race,” but \nTitle VII and the ADEA also contain that wording and this Court \nnonetheless held that those statutes impose disparate-impact liabil-\nity.\n  The 1988 amendments signal that Congress ratified such liability.  \nCongress knew that  all nine Courts  of Appeals to have addressed the \nquestion  had  concluded  the  FHA  encompassed  disparate-impact \nclaims, and three exemptions from liability in the 1988  amendments \nwould have been superfluous had Congress assumed that disparate-\nimpact liability did not exist under the FHA. \n  Recognition of disparate-impact claims is also consistent with the \ncentral purpose of the FHA, which, like Title VII and the ADEA, was \nenacted to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of the \nNation’s economy.  Suits targeting unlawful zoning laws and other \nhousing restrictions that unfairly exclude minorities from certain \nneighborhoods without sufficient justification are at the heartland of \ndisparate-impact  liability.    See,  e.g.,  Huntington  v.   Huntington \nBranch, NAACP, 488 U. S. 15, 16–18.  Recognition of disparate-\nimpact liability under the FHA plays an important role in uncovering \ndiscriminatory intent: it permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious \nprejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as \ndisparate treatment.   \n  But disparate-impact liability has always been properly limited in \nkey respects to avoid serious constitutional questions that might \narise under the FHA, e.g., if such liability were imposed based solely \non a showing of a statistical disparity.  Here, the underlying dispute \ninvolves a novel theory of liability that  may, on remand, be seen \nsimply as an attempt to second-guess which of two reasonable ap-\nproaches a housing authority should follow in allocating tax credits \nfor low-income housing.  An important and appropriate  means of en-\nsuring that disparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give \nhousing authorities and private developers leeway to state and ex-\nplain the valid interest their policies serve, an analysis that is analo-\ngous to Title VII’s business necessity standard.  It would be paradoxi-\ncal to construe the FHA to impose onerous costs on actors who \nencourage  revitalizing  dilapidated  housing  in  the  Nation’s  cities  \nmerely because some other priority  might seem preferable.  A dispar-\nate-impact claim relying on a statistical disparity must fail if the \nplaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that \ndisparity.  A robust causality requirement is important in ensuring \nthat defendants do not resort to the use of racial quotas.  Courts must  \n \n\n4  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nSyllabus \n \ntherefore examine with care whether a plaintiff has made out a pri-\nma facie showing of disparate impact, and prompt resolution of these \ncases is important.  Policies, whether  governmental or private, are \nnot contrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they are “ar-\ntificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.”  Griggs, 401 U. S., at \n431. Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-impact liability to be \nso expansive as  to inject racial considerations into every housing de-\ncision.  These limitations are also necessary to protect defendants \nagainst abusive disparate-impact claims.   \n  And when courts do find liability under a disparate-impact theory, \ntheir remedial orders must  be consistent with the Constitution.  Re-\nmedial orders in disparate-impact cases should concentrate on the \nelimination of the offending practice, and courts should strive to de-\nsign race-neutral remedies.  Remedial orders that impose racial tar-\ngets or quotas might raise difficult constitutional questions. \n  While the automatic or pervasive injection of race into public and \nprivate transactions covered by the FHA has special dangers, race \nmay be considered in certain circumstances and in a proper fashion.  \nThis Court does not impugn local housing authorities’ race-neutral ef-\nforts to encourage revitalization of communities that have long suf-\nfered the harsh consequences of segregated housing patterns.  These \nauthorities may choose to foster diversity and combat racial isolation \nwith race-neutral tools, and mere awareness of race in attempting to \nsolve the problems facing inner cities does  not doom that endeavor at \nthe outset.

THE IN-\nCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC., ET  AL. \n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\nAPPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \n[June 25, 2015] \n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court. \n  The  underlying  dispute  in  this  case  concerns  where \nhousing for low-income persons should be constructed in \nDallas,  Texas—that  is,  whether  the  housing  should  be \nbuilt in the inner city or in the suburbs.  This dispute\ncomes to the Court on a disparate-impact theory of liabil-\nity.  In contrast to a disparate-treatment case, where a \n“plaintiff must establish that the defendant had a discrim-\ninatory intent or motive,” a plaintiff bringing a disparate-\nimpact claim challenges practices that have a “dispropor-\ntionately adverse effect on minorities” and are otherwise \nunjustified by a legitimate rationale.  Ricci v. DeStefano, \n557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009) (internal quotation  marks omit-\nted).  The question presented for the Court’s determina-\ntion  is  whether  disparate-impact  claims  are  cognizable\nunder  the  Fair  Housing  Act  (or  FHA),  82  Stat.  81,  as \namended, 42 U. S. C. §3601 et seq.  \nI \nA \n  Before turning to the question presented, it is necessary  \n\n2  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\nto discuss a different federal statute that gives rise to this \ndispute.  The  Federal  Government  provides  low-income \nhousing  tax  credits  that  are  distributed  to  developers \nthrough designated state agencies.  26 U. S. C. §42.  Con-\ngress  has  directed  States  to  develop  plans  identifying\nselection criteria for distributing the credits.  §42(m)(1).  \nThose plans must include certain criteria, such as public \nhousing  waiting  lists,  §42(m)(1)(C),  as  well  as  certain \npreferences,  including  that  low-income  housing  units\n“contribut[e] to a concerted community revitalization plan” \nand be built in census tracts populated predominantly by \nlow-income residents.  §§42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III), 42(d)(5)(ii)(I).  \nFederal law thus favors the distribution of these tax cred-\nits  for  the  development  of  housing  units  in  low-income \nareas. \n  In the State of Texas these federal credits are distrib- \nuted by the Texas Department of Housing and Community \nAffairs  (Department).  Under  Texas  law,  a  developer’s\napplication  for  the  tax  credits  is  scored  under  a  point \nsystem that gives priority to statutory criteria, such as the \nfinancial  feasibility  of  the  development  project  and  the \nincome  level  of  tenants.  Tex.  Govt.  Code  Ann.  \n§§2306.6710(a)–(b)  (West  2008).    The  Texas  Attorney \nGeneral has interpreted state law to permit the considera-\ntion of additional criteria, such as whether the housing \nunits will be built in a neighborhood with good schools.  \nThose criteria cannot be awarded more points than statu-\ntorily mandated criteria.  Tex. Op. Atty.  Gen. No. GA– \n0208, pp. 2–6 (2004), 2004 WL 1434796, *4–*6. \n  The  Inclusive  Communities  Project,  Inc.  (ICP),  is  a \nTexas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income \nfamilies in obtaining affordable housing.  In 2008, the ICP \nbrought this suit against the Department and its officers \nin the United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of Texas.  As relevant here, it brought a disparate-\nimpact claim under §§804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA.  The \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nICP alleged the Department has caused continued segre-\ngated housing patterns by its disproportionate allocation \nof the tax credits, granting too many credits for housing in \npredominantly black inner-city areas and too few in pre-\ndominantly  white  suburban  neighborhoods.  The  ICP \ncontended that the Department must modify its selection \ncriteria  in  order  to  encourage  the  construction  of  low-\nincome housing in suburban communities. \n  The District Court concluded that the ICP had estab-\nlished a prima facie case of disparate impact.  It relied on  \ntwo pieces of statistical evidence.  First, it found “from \n1999–2008,  [the  Department]  approved  tax  credits  for \n49.7% of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Cauca-\nsian  areas,  but  only  approved  37.4%  of  proposed  non-\nelderly  units  in  90%  to  100%  Caucasian  areas.”    749  \nF. Supp. 2d 486, 499 (ND Tex. 2010) (footnote omitted).  \nSecond, it found “92.29% of [low-income housing tax credit] \nunits in the city of Dallas were located in census tracts \nwith less than 50% Caucasian residents.”  Ibid.  \n  The District Court then placed the burden on the De-\npartment to rebut the ICP’s prima facie showing of dis-\nparate  impact.  860  F. Supp.  2d  312,  322–323  (2012).  \nAfter assuming the Department’s proffered interests were \nlegitimate, id., at 326, the District Court held that a de-\nfendant—here  the  Department—must  prove  “that  there \nare no other less discriminatory alternatives to advancing \ntheir proffered interests,” ibid.  Because, in its view, the  \nDepartment “failed to meet [its] burden of proving that \nthere are no less discriminatory alternatives,” the District \nCourt ruled for the ICP.  Id., at 331. \n  The District Court’s remedial order required the addi-\ntion of new selection criteria for the tax credits.  For in-\nstance, it awarded points for units built in neighborhoods \nwith good schools and disqualified sites that are located \nadjacent to or near hazardous conditions, such as high \ncrime areas or landfills.  See 2012 WL 3201401 (Aug. 7, \n\n4  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\n2012).  The  remedial  order  contained  no  explicit  racial \ntargets or quotas.\n  While the Department’s appeal was pending, the Secre-\ntary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a\nregulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-\nimpact liability.  See Implementation of the Fair Housing \nAct’s Discriminatory Effects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460 \n(2013).  The regulation also established a burden-shifting \nframework  for  adjudicating  disparate-impact  claims.  \nUnder the  regulation, a plaintiff first must make a prima \nfacie showing of disparate impact.  That is, the plaintiff \n“has  the  burden  of  proving  that  a  challenged  practice \ncaused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect.”  \n24 CFR §100.500(c)(1) (2014).  If a statistical discrepancy \nis caused by factors other than the defendant’s policy, a \nplaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, and there is \nno liability.  After a plaintiff does establish a prima facie \nshowing  of  disparate  impact,  the  burden  shifts  to  the \ndefendant to “prov[e] that the challenged practice is neces-\nsary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, non-\ndiscriminatory interests.”  §100.500(c)(2).  HUD has clari-\nfied that this step of the analysis “is analogous to the Title \nVII  requirement  that  an  employer’s  interest  in  an  em-\nployment practice with a disparate impact be job related.”  \n78 Fed. Reg. 11470.  Once a defendant has satisfied its \nburden at step two, a plaintiff may “prevail upon proving \nthat the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory inter-\nests supporting the challenged practice could be served by \nanother  practice  that  has  a  less  discriminatory  effect.”  \n§100.500(c)(3).\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, con-\nsistent with its precedent, that disparate-impact claims \nare cognizable under the FHA.  747 F. 3d 275, 280 (2014).  \nOn the merits, however, the Court of Appeals reversed and \nremanded.  Relying  on  HUD’s  regulation,  the  Court  of \nAppeals held that it was improper for the District Court to  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nhave placed the burden on the Department to prove there \nwere no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating low-\nincome housing tax credits.  Id., at 282–283.  In a concur-\nring  opinion,  Judge  Jones  stated  that  on  remand  the \nDistrict  Court  should  reexamine  whether  the  ICP  had  \nmade out a prima facie case of disparate impact.  She  \nsuggested  the  District  Court  incorrectly  relied  on  bare \nstatistical  evidence  without  engaging  in  any  analysis\nabout causation.  She further observed that, if the fed- \neral law providing for the distribution of low-income hous-\ning tax credits ties the Department’s hands to such an \nextent that it lacks a meaningful choice, then there is no \ndisparate-impact liability.  See id., at 283–284 (specially \nconcurring opinion). \n  The Department filed a petition for a writ of certiorari \non  the  question  whether  disparate-impact  claims  are\ncognizable under the FHA.  The question was one of first \nimpression,  see  Huntington  v.  Huntington  Branch,  \nNAACP, 488 U. S. 15  (1988) (per curiam), and certiorari  \nfollowed, 573 U. S. ___ (2014).  It is now appropriate to \nprovide a brief history of the FHA’s enactment and its \nlater amendment. \nB \n  De jure  residential  segregation  by  race  was  declared \nunconstitutional almost a century ago, Buchanan v. War-\nley, 245 U. S. 60 (1917), but its vestiges remain today, \nintertwined with the country’s economic and social life.  \nSome segregated housing patterns can be traced to condi-\ntions that arose in the mid-20th century.  Rapid urbaniza-\ntion, concomitant with the rise of suburban developments \naccessible by car, led many white families to leave the \ninner cities.  This often left minority families concentrated \nin  the  center  of  the  Nation’s  cities.    During  this  time, \nvarious practices were followed, sometimes with govern-\nmental support, to encourage and maintain the separation  \n\n6  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\nof the races: Racially restrictive covenants prevented the \nconveyance of property to minorities, see Shelley v. Krae- \nmer, 334 U.  S. 1 (1948); steering by real-estate agents led \npotential buyers to consider homes in racially homogenous \nareas; and discriminatory lending practices, often referred \nto as redlining, precluded minority families from purchas-\ning homes in affluent areas.  See, e.g., M. Klarman, Unfin-\nished Business: Racial Equality in American History 140–\n141 (2007); Brief for Housing Scholars as Amici Curiae  \n22–23.   By the 1960’s, these policies, practices, and preju-\ndices had created many predominantly black inner cities\nsurrounded by mostly white suburbs.  See K. Clark, Dark  \nGhetto: Dilemmas of Social Power 11, 21–26 (1965). \n  The mid-1960’s was a period of considerable social un-\nrest; and, in response, President Lyndon Johnson estab-\nlished the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disor-\nders, commonly known as the Kerner Commission.  Exec. \nOrder No. 11365, 3 CFR 674 (1966–1970 Comp.).  After \nextensive factfinding the Commission identified residen-\ntial segregation and unequal housing and economic condi-\ntions in the inner cities as significant, underlying causes of \nthe social unrest.  See Report of the National Advisory \nCommission on Civil Disorders 91 (1968) (Kerner Com-\nmission  Report).  The  Commission  found  that  “[n]early \ntwo-thirds of all nonwhite families living in the central \ncities today live in neighborhoods marked by substandard\nhousing and general urban blight.”  Id., at 13.  The Com-\nmission further found that both open and covert racial \ndiscrimination  prevented  black  families  from  obtaining \nbetter  housing  and  moving  to  integrated  communities.   \nIbid.    The  Commission  concluded  that  “[o]ur  Nation  is \nmoving  toward  two  societies,  one  black,   one  white— \nseparate and unequal.”  Id., at 1.  To reverse “[t]his deep-\nening racial division,” ibid., it recommended enactment of  \n“a  comprehensive  and  enforceable  open-occupancy  law \nmaking it an offense to discriminate in the sale or rental of \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nany housing . . . on the basis of race, creed, color, or na-\ntional origin.”  Id., at 263. \n  In April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassi-\nnated in Memphis, Tennessee, and the Nation faced a new \nurgency to resolve the social unrest in the inner cities.  \nCongress responded by adopting the Kerner Commission’s \nrecommendation and passing the Fair Housing Act.  The \nstatute addressed the denial of housing opportunities on \nthe basis of “race, color, religion, or national origin.”  Civil  \nRights Act of 1968, §804, 82 Stat. 83.  Then, in 1988, \nCongress amended the FHA.  Among other provisions, it\ncreated certain exemptions from liability and added “fa-\nmilial  status”  as  a  protected  characteristic.    See  Fair  \nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 1619. \nII  \n  The issue here is whether, under a proper interpretation \nof the FHA, housing decisions with a disparate impact are \nprohibited.  Before  turning  to  the  FHA,  however,  it  is \nnecessary to consider two other antidiscrimination stat-\nutes that preceded it.\n  The first relevant statute is §703(a) of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255.  The Court ad-\ndressed the concept of disparate impact under this statute \nin Griggs v.  Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971).  There, \nthe employer had a policy requiring its manual laborers to \npossess a high school diploma and to obtain satisfactory \nscores on two intelligence tests.  The Court of Appeals held \nthe employer had not adopted these job requirements for a \nracially discriminatory purpose, and the plaintiffs did not\nchallenge that holding in this Court.  Instead, the plain-\ntiffs argued §703(a)(2) covers the discriminatory effect of a \npractice  as  well  as  the  motivation  behind  the  practice.  \nSection 703(a), as amended, provides as follows: \n  “It shall be an unlawful employer practice for an \nemployer— \n\n8  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\n  “(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\nvidual, or otherwise to discriminate against any indi-\nvidual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such \nindividual’s  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  or  national \norigin; or\n  “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or \napplicants for employment in any way which would \ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-\nment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his \nstatus as an employee, because of such individual’s \nrace,  color,  religion,  sex,  or  national  origin.”  42 \nU. S. C. §2000e–2(a).  \nThe Court did not quote or cite the full statute, but rather \nrelied solely on §703(a)(2).  Griggs, 401 U. S., at 426, n. 1. \n  In  interpreting  §703(a)(2),  the  Court  reasoned  that  \ndisparate-impact liability furthered the purpose and de-\nsign  of  the  statute.  The  Court  explained  that,  in \n§703(a)(2), Congress “proscribe[d] not only overt discrimi-\nnation but also practices that are fair in form, but discrim-\ninatory in operation.”  Id., at 431.  For that reason, as the \nCourt noted, “Congress directed the thrust of [§703(a)(2)] \nto the consequences of employment practices, not simply \nthe motivation.”  Id., at 432.  In light of the statute’s goal \nof  achieving  “equality  of  employment  opportunities  and \nremov[ing]  barriers  that  have  operated  in  the  past”  to \nfavor some races over others, the Court held §703(a)(2) of \nTitle VII must be interpreted to allow disparate-impact \nclaims.  Id., at 429–430. \n  The Court put important limits on its holding: namely, \nnot all employment practices causing a disparate impact \nimpose  liability  under  §703(a)(2).    In  this  respect,  the \nCourt held that “business necessity” constitutes a defense \nto disparate-impact claims.  Id.,  at 431.  This rule pro-\nvides,  for  example,  that  in  a   disparate-impact  case, \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \n§703(a)(2) does not prohibit hiring criteria with a “mani-\nfest relationship” to job performance.  Id., at 432; see also  \nRicci, 557 U. S., at 587–589 (emphasizing the importance \nof  the  business  necessity  defense  to  disparate-impact \nliability).  On the facts before it, the Court in Griggs found \na violation of Title VII because the employer could not \nestablish that high school diplomas and general intelli-\ngence  tests  were  related  to  the  job  performance  of  its \nmanual laborers.  See 401 U. S., at 431–432. \n  The second relevant statute that bears on the proper \ninterpretation of the FHA is the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602 et seq., as  \namended.  Section 4(a) of the ADEA provides: \n“It shall be unlawful for an employer— \n  “(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\nvidual or otherwise discriminate against any individ-\nual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such \nindividual’s age;\n  “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in \nany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise \nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of\nsuch individual’s age; or\n  “(3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in or-\nder to comply with this chapter.”  29 U. S. C. §623(a). \nThe Court first addressed whether this provision allows \ndisparate-impact claims in Smith v. City of Jackson, 544  \nU. S. 228 (2005).  There, a group of older employees chal-\nlenged  their  employer’s  decision   to  give  proportionately \ngreater raises to employees with less than five years of \nexperience.\n  Explaining that Griggs “represented the better reading \nof [Title VII’s] statutory text,” 544 U. S., at 235, a plurality \nof the Court concluded that the same reasoning pertained  \n\n10  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\nto §4(a)(2) of the ADEA.  The Smith plurality emphasized\nthat both §703(a)(2) of Title VII and §4(a)(2) of the ADEA \ncontain language “prohibit[ing] such actions that ‘deprive \nany individual of employment opportunities or otherwise \nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of such \nindividual’s’ race or age.”  544 U. S., at 235.  As the plural-\nity observed, the text of these provisions “focuses on the  \neffects of the action on the employee rather than the moti-\nvation for the action of the employer” and therefore com-\npels recognition of disparate-impact liability.  Id., at 236.   \nIn a separate opinion, JUSTICE SCALIA found the ADEA’s  \ntext ambiguous and thus deferred under Chevron U. S. A.  \nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.  \n837 (1984), to an Equal Employment Opportunity Com-\nmission  regulation  interpreting   the  ADEA  to  impose\ndisparate-impact liability, see 544 U. S., at 243–247 (opin-\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \nTogether, Griggs holds and the plurality in Smith in-\nstructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed to  \nencompass disparate-impact claims when their text refers \nto the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset \nof actors, and where that interpretation is consistent with  \nstatutory purpose.  These cases also teach that disparate-\nimpact liability must be limited so employers and other \nregulated entities are able to make the practical business \nchoices and profit-related decisions that sustain a vibrant \nand dynamic free-enterprise system.  And before rejecting \na business justification—or, in the case of a governmental \nentity, an analogous public interest—a court must deter-\nmine that a plaintiff has shown that there is “an available \nalternative . . . practice that has less disparate impact and \nserves the [entity’s] legitimate needs.”  Ricci, supra, at  \n578.  The cases interpreting Title VII and the ADEA pro-\nvide essential background and instruction in the case now \nbefore the Court.  \n  Turning to the FHA, the ICP relies on two provisions.  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nSection 804(a) provides that it shall be unlawful: \n  “To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona \nfide  offer,  or  to  refuse  to  negotiate  for  the  sale  or \nrental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a \ndwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, \nsex, familial status, or national origin.”  42 U. S. C. \n§3604(a).  \nHere, the phrase “otherwise make unavailable” is of cen-\ntral importance to the analysis that follows. \n  Section 805(a), in turn, provides: \n  “It shall be unlawful for any person or other entity \nwhose  business  includes  engaging  in  real  estate-\nrelated transactions to discriminate against any per-\nson in making available such a transaction, or in the \nterms or conditions of  such a transaction, because of \nrace, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or \nnational origin.”  §3605(a). \n  Applied here, the logic of Griggs and Smith provides\nstrong support for the conclusion that the FHA encom-\npasses  disparate-impact  claims.    Congress’  use  of  the \nphrase “otherwise make unavailable” refers to the conse-\nquences of  an action rather than the actor’s intent.  See  \nUnited States v. Giles,  300 U. S. 41, 48 (1937) (explaining \nthat the “word ‘make’ has many meanings, among them \n‘[t]o cause to exist, appear or occur’” (quoting Webster’s \n \nNew International Dictionary 1485 (2d ed. 1934))).  This \nresults-oriented language counsels in favor of recognizing \ndisparate-impact liability.  See Smith, supra, at 236.  The \nCourt has construed statutory language similar to §805(a) \nto include disparate-impact liability.  See, e.g.,  Board of  \nEd. of City School Dist. of New York v. Harris, 444 U. S. \n130,  140–141  (1979)  (holding  the  term  “discriminat[e]” \nencompassed disparate-impact liability in the context of a \nstatute’s text, history, purpose, and structure).  \n\n12  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\n  A comparison to the antidiscrimination statutes exam-\nined in Griggs and Smith is useful.  Title VII’s and the  \nADEA’s “otherwise adversely affect” language is equiva-\nlent in function and purpose to the FHA’s “otherwise make \nunavailable” language.  In these three statutes the opera-\ntive text looks to results.  The relevant statutory phrases, \nmoreover, play an identical role in the structure common \nto all three statutes: Located at the end of lengthy sen-\ntences  that  begin  with  prohibitions  on  disparate  treat-\nment,  they  serve  as  catchall  phrases  looking  to  conse-\nquences, not intent.  And all three statutes use the word \n“otherwise”  to  introduce  the  results-oriented  phrase.  \n“Otherwise” means “in a different way or manner,” thus \nsignaling a shift in emphasis from an actor’s intent to the \nconsequences of his actions.  Webster’s Third New Inter-\nnational Dictionary 1598 (1971).  This similarity in text\nand structure is all the more compelling given that Con-\ngress passed the FHA in 1968—only four years after pass-\ning  Title  VII  and  only  four  months  after  enacting  the \nADEA.  \n  It  is  true  that  Congress  did  not  reiterate  Title  VII’s \nexact language in the FHA, but that is because to do so \nwould  have  made  the  relevant  sentence  awkward  and \nunclear.  A  provision  making  it  unlawful  to  “refuse  to \nsell[,] . . . or otherwise [adversely affect], a dwelling to any \nperson” because of a protected trait would be grammatically \nobtuse, difficult to interpret, and far more expansive in \nscope than Congress likely intended.  Congress thus chose \nwords that serve the same purpose and bear the same \nbasic meaning but are consistent with the structure and \nobjectives of the FHA. \n  Emphasizing that the FHA uses the phrase “because of \nrace,”  the  Department  argues  this  language  forecloses \ndisparate-impact liability since “[a]n action is not taken\n‘because of race’ unless race is a reason for the action.”   \nBrief  for  Petitioners  26.    Griggs  and  Smith,  however,  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ndispose of this argument.  Both Title VII and the ADEA \ncontain identical “because of ” language, see 42 U. S. C. \n§2000e–2(a)(2);  29  U. S. C.  §623(a)(2),  and  the  Court \nnonetheless held those statutes impose disparate-impact \nliability. \n  In addition, it is of crucial importance that the existence \nof disparate-impact liability is supported by amendments\nto the FHA that Congress enacted in 1988.  By that time,\nall nine Courts of Appeals to have addressed the question\nhad concluded the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate-\nimpact  claims.  See  Huntington  Branch,  NAACP  v. \nHuntington, 844 F. 2d 926, 935–936 (CA2 1988); Resident \nAdvisory  Bd.  v.  Rizzo,  564  F. 2d  126,  146  (CA3  1977); \nSmith v. Clarkton, 682 F. 2d 1055, 1065 (CA4 1982); Han-\nson v. Veterans Administration, 800 F. 2d 1381, 1386 (CA5 \n1986);  Arthur  v.  Toledo,  782  F. 2d  565,  574–575  (CA6  \n1986); Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Arling-\nton  Heights,  558  F. 2d  1283,  1290  (CA7  1977);  United  \nStates  v.  Black  Jack,  508  F. 2d  1179,  1184–1185  (CA8 \n1974); Halet v. Wend Investment Co., 672 F. 2d 1305, 1311  \n(CA9 1982); United States v. Marengo Cty. Comm’n, 731 \nF. 2d 1546, 1559, n. 20 (CA11 1984). \n  When it amended the FHA, Congress was aware of this \nunanimous precedent.  And with that understanding, it \nmade a considered judgment to retain the relevant statu-\ntory text.  See H. R. Rep. No. 100–711, p. 21, n. 52 (1988) \n(H. R.  Rep.)  (discussing  suits  premised  on  disparate-\nimpact claims and related judicial precedent); 134 Cong. \nRec.  23711  (1988)  (statement  of  Sen.  Kennedy)  (noting \nunanimity of Federal Courts of Appeals concerning dis-\nparate impact); Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1987: \nHearings on S. 558 before the Subcommittee on the Con-\nstitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 100th \nCong., 1st Sess., 529 (1987) (testimony of Professor Robert \nSchwemm)  (describing  consensus  judicial  view  that  the\nFHA  imposed  disparate-impact  liability).  Indeed,  Con-\n\n14  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\ngress  rejected  a  proposed  amendment  that  would  have\neliminated  disparate-impact  liability  for  certain  zoning \ndecisions.  See H. R. Rep., at 89–93.\n  Against this background understanding in the legal and \nregulatory system, Congress’ decision in 1988 to amend \nthe FHA while still adhering to the operative language in \n§§804(a) and 805(a) is convincing support for the conclu-\nsion that Congress accepted and ratified the unanimous \nholdings of the Courts of Appeals finding disparate-impact \nliability.  “If a word or phrase has been . . . given a uni-\nform interpretation by inferior courts . . . , a later version \nof that act  perpetuating the wording is presumed to carry \nforward  that  interpretation.”    A.  Scalia  &  B.  Garner,  \nReading  Law:  The  Interpretation  of  Legal  Texts   322  \n(2012); see also Forest Grove School Dist. v. T.  A., 557 U. S.  \n230, 244, n. 11 (2009) (“When Congress amended [the Act]\nwithout  altering  the  text  of  [the  relevant  provision],  it\nimplicitly adopted [this Court’s] construction of the stat-\nute”); Manhattan Properties, Inc. v. Irving Trust Co., 291 \nU. S.  320,  336  (1934)  (explaining,  where  the  Courts  of\nAppeals  had  reached  a  consensus  interpretation  of  the \nBankruptcy Act and Congress had amended the Act with-\nout  changing  the  relevant  provision,  “[t]his  is  persua- \nsive that the construction adopted by the [lower federal] \ncourts has been acceptable to the legislative arm of the \ngovernment”). \n  Further and convincing confirmation of Congress’ un-\nderstanding  that  disparate-impact  liability  exists  under \nthe FHA is revealed by the substance of the 1988 amend-\nments.  The amendments included three exemptions from \nliability  that  assume  the  existence  of  disparate-impact \nclaims.  The  most  logical  conclusion  is  that  the  three \namendments  were  deemed  necessary  because  Congress \npresupposed disparate impact under the FHA as it had \nbeen enacted in 1968. \n  The relevant 1988 amendments were as follows.  First,  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nCongress added a clarifying provision: “Nothing in [the \nFHA] prohibits a person engaged in the business of fur-\nnishing appraisals of real property to take into considera-\ntion factors other than race, color, religion, national origin, \nsex, handicap, or familial status.”  42 U. S. C. §3605(c).  \nSecond, Congress provided: “Nothing in [the FHA] prohib-\nits conduct against a person because such person has been \nconvicted  by  any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  of  the \nillegal  manufacture  or  distribution  of  a  controlled  sub-\nstance.”  §3607(b)(4).    And  finally,  Congress  specified: \n“Nothing in [the FHA] limits the applicability of any rea-\nsonable . .  . restrictions regarding the maximum number \nof occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.”  §3607(b)(1).\n  The exemptions embodied in these amendments would \nbe superfluous if Congress had assumed that disparate-\nimpact liability did not exist under the FHA.  See Gus-\ntafson  v.  Alloyd  Co.,  513  U. S.  561,  574  (1995)  (“[T]he \nCourt  will  avoid  a  reading  which  renders  some  words \naltogether  redundant”).  Indeed,  none  of  these  amend-\nments would make sense if the FHA encompassed only \ndisparate-treatment claims.  If that were the sole ground\nfor liability, the amendments merely restate black-letter \nlaw.  If an actor makes a decision based on reasons other \nthan a protected category, there is no disparate-treatment \nliability.  See, e.g., Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. \nBurdine, 450 U. S. 248, 254 (1981).  But the amendments \ndo  constrain  disparate-impact  liability.  For  instance,  \ncertain criminal convictions are correlated with sex and  \nrace.  See, e.g., Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, \n98 (2007) (discussing the racial disparity in convictions for \ncrack  cocaine  offenses).    By  adding  an  exemption  from \nliability  for  exclusionary  practices  aimed  at  individuals \nwith drug convictions, Congress ensured disparate-impact \nliability would not lie if a landlord excluded tenants with \nsuch convictions.  The same is true of the provision allow-\ning  for  reasonable  restrictions  on  occupancy.    And  the \n\n16  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\nexemption from liability for real-estate appraisers is in the \nsame  section  as  §805(a)’s  prohibition  of  discriminatory \npractices in real-estate transactions, thus indicating Con-\ngress’  recognition  that  disparate-impact  liability  arose \nunder §805(a).  In short, the 1988 amendments signal that \nCongress ratified disparate-impact liability. \n  A comparison to Smith’s discussion of the ADEA further  \ndemonstrates why the Department’s interpretation would \nrender  the  1988  amendments  superfluous.   Under  the \nADEA’s  reasonable-factor-other-than-age  (RFOA)  provi-\nsion, an employer is permitted to take an otherwise pro-\nhibited action where “the differentiation is based on rea-\nsonable factors other than age.”  29 U. S. C. §623(f)(1).  In \n \nother words, if an employer makes a decision based on a \nreasonable factor other than age, it cannot be said to have \nmade a decision on the  basis of an employee’s age.  Accord-\ning to the Smith plurality, the RFOA provision “plays its \nprincipal role” “in cases involving disparate-impact claims” \n“by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attribut-\nable to a nonage factor that was ‘reasonable.’”  544 U. S.,  \n \nat 239.  The plurality thus reasoned that the RFOA provi-\nsion would be “simply unnecessary to avoid liability under \nthe ADEA” if liability were limited to disparate-treatment \nclaims.  Id., at 238. \n  A similar logic applies here.  If a real-estate appraiser \ntook into account a neighborhood’s schools, one could not \nsay the appraiser acted because of race.  And by embed-\nding 42 U. S. C. §3605(c)’s exemption in the statutory text, \nCongress  ensured  that  disparate-impact  liability  would \nnot be allowed either.  Indeed, the inference of disparate-\nimpact liability is even stronger here than it was in Smith. \nAs originally enacted, the ADEA included the RFOA pro-\nvision, see §4(f)(1), 81 Stat. 603, whereas here Congress \nadded the relevant exemptions in the 1988 amendments \nagainst the backdrop of the uniform view of the Courts of \nAppeals that the FHA imposed disparate-impact liability. \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Recognition  of  disparate-impact  claims  is  consistent\nwith the FHA’s central purpose.  See Smith, supra, at 235 \n(plurality opinion); Griggs, 401 U.  S., at 432.  The FHA, \nlike Title VII and the ADEA, was enacted to eradicate  \ndiscriminatory practices within a sector of our Nation’s  \neconomy.  See 42 U. S. C. §3601 (“It is the policy of the \nUnited States to provide, within constitutional limitations, \nfor  fair  housing  throughout  the  United  States”);  H.  R. \nRep., at 15 (explaining the FHA “provides a clear national \npolicy against discrimination in housing”). \n  These unlawful practices include zoning laws and other \nhousing  restrictions  that  function  unfairly  to  exclude \nminorities from certain neighborhoods without any suffi-\ncient justification.  Suits targeting such practices reside at \nthe  heartland  of  disparate-impact  liability.  See,  e.g., \nHuntington, 488 U. S., at 16–18 (invalidating zoning law \npreventing construction of multifamily rental units); Black  \nJack,  508  F. 2d,  at  1182–1188  (invalidating  ordinance \nprohibiting  construction  of  new  multifamily  dwellings); \nGreater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center v. St. \nBernard Parish, 641 F. Supp. 2d 563, 569, 577–578 (ED \nLa. 2009) (invalidating post-Hurricane Katrina ordinance \nrestricting  the  rental  of  housing  units  to  only  “‘blood \n \nrelative[s]’” in an area of the city that was 88.3% white \n \nand 7.6% black); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 52–53 (discuss-\ning  these  cases).  The  availability  of  disparate-impact \nliability, furthermore, has allowed private developers to \nvindicate the FHA’s objectives and to protect their prop- \nerty rights by stopping  municipalities from enforcing arbi- \ntrary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances barring \nthe construction of certain types of housing units.  See, \ne.g.,  Huntington, supra, at 18.  Recognition of disparate-\nimpact liability under the FHA also plays a role in uncov-\nering discriminatory intent: It permits plaintiffs to coun-\nteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that \nescape easy classification as disparate treatment.  In this  \n\n18  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\nway  disparate-impact  liability  may  prevent  segregated \nhousing patterns that might otherwise result from covert \nand illicit stereotyping.\n  But disparate-impact liability has always been properly \nlimited  in key respects that  avoid the serious constitutional \nquestions that might arise under the FHA, for instance, \nif such liability were imposed based solely on a showing of \na  statistical  disparity.  Disparate-impact  liability  man-\ndates the “removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary \nbarriers,”  not  the  displacement  of  valid  governmental \npolicies.  Griggs, supra, at 431.  The FHA is not an in-\nstrument  to  force  housing  authorities  to  reorder  their \npriorities.  Rather, the FHA aims to ensure that those  \npriorities  can  be  achieved  without  arbitrarily  creating \ndiscriminatory effects or perpetuating segregation. \n  Unlike the heartland of disparate-impact suits targeting \nartificial barriers to housing, the underlying dispute in \nthis case involves a novel theory of liability.  See Seicsh-\nnaydre,  Is  Disparate  Impact  Having  Any  Impact?  An \nAppellate  Analysis  of  Forty  Years  of  Disparate  Impact\nClaims Under the Fair Housing Act, 63 Am. U. L. Rev. \n357,  360–363  (2013)  (noting  the  rarity  of  this  type   of \nclaim).  This case, on remand, may be seen simply as an \nattempt  to  second-guess  which  of  two  reasonable  ap-\nproaches a housing authority should follow in the sound\nexercise of its discretion in allocating tax credits for low-\nincome housing. \n  An important and appropriate means of ensuring that \ndisparate-impact  liability  is  properly  limited  is  to  give \nhousing authorities and private developers leeway to state \nand  explain  the  valid  interest  served  by  their  policies.  \nThis  step  of  the  analysis  is  analogous  to  the  business \nnecessity standard under Title VII and provides a defense \nagainst disparate-impact liability.  See 78 Fed. Reg. 11470 \n(explaining that HUD did not use the phrase “business \nnecessity” because that “phrase may not be easily under-\n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nstood to cover the full scope of practices covered by the \nFair  Housing  Act,  which  applies  to  individuals,  busi-\nnesses, nonprofit organizations, and public  entities”).  As the \nCourt  explained  in  Ricci,  an  entity  “could  be  liable  for \ndisparate-impact  discrimination  only  if  the  [challenged \npractices] were not job related and consistent with busi-\nness necessity.”  557 U. S., at 587.  Just as an employer \nmay  maintain  a  workplace  requirement  that  causes  a \ndisparate  impact  if  that  requirement  is  a  “reasonable \nmeasure[ment] of job performance,” Griggs, supra, at 436,  \nso too must housing authorities and private developers be \nallowed to maintain a policy if they can prove it is neces-\nsary to achieve a valid interest.  To be sure, the Title VII \nframework may not transfer exactly to the fair-housing \ncontext, but the comparison suffices for present purposes. \n  It would be paradoxical to construe the FHA to impose \nonerous costs on actors who encourage revitalizing dilapi-\ndated housing in our Nation’s cities merely because some \nother priority might seem preferable.  Entrepreneurs must \nbe given latitude to consider market factors.  Zoning offi-\ncials, moreover, must often make decisions based on a mix \nof factors, both objective (such as cost and traffic patterns) \nand, at least to some extent, subjective (such as preserving \nhistoric architecture).  These factors contribute to a com-\nmunity’s  quality  of  life  and  are  legitimate  concerns  for\nhousing authorities.  The FHA does not decree a particular \nvision of urban development; and it does not put housing \nauthorities  and  private  developers  in  a  double  bind  of \nliability, subject to suit whether they choose to rejuvenate \na city core or to promote new low-income housing in sub-\nurban communities.  As HUD itself recognized in its re-\ncent  rulemaking,  disparate-impact  liability  “does  not \nmandate that affordable housing be located in neighbor-\nhoods with any particular characteristic.”  78 Fed. Reg.  \n11476. \n  In a similar vein, a disparate-impact claim that relies on \n\n20  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\na statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point \nto a defendant’s policy or policies causing that disparity.  \nA  robust  causality  requirement  ensures  that  “[r]acial \nimbalance . . . does not, without more, establish a prima \nfacie case of disparate impact” and thus protects defend-\nants from being held liable for racial disparities they did \nnot create.  Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S.  \n642, 653 (1989), superseded by statute on other grounds,\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k).  Without adequate safeguards at \nthe  prima  facie  stage,  disparate-impact  liability  might\ncause race to be used and considered in a pervasive way \nand  “would  almost  inexorably  lead”  governmental  or\nprivate  entities  to  use  “numerical  quotas,”  and  serious \nconstitutional questions then  could arise.  490 U. S., at 653.  \n  The litigation at issue here provides an example.  From  \nthe standpoint of determining advantage or disadvantage \nto racial minorities, it seems difficult to say as a general \nmatter that a decision to build low-income housing in a \nblighted  inner-city  neighborhood  instead  of  a  suburb  is\ndiscriminatory, or vice versa.  If those sorts of judgments \nare  subject  to  challenge  without  adequate  safeguards, \nthen  there  is  a  danger  that  potential  defendants  may\nadopt  racial  quotas—a  circumstance  that  itself  raises \nserious constitutional concerns. \n  Courts  must  therefore  examine  with  care  whether  a  \nplaintiff  has  made  out  a  prima  facie  case  of  disparate \nimpact and prompt resolution of these cases is important.    \nA plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or \nproduce statistical evidence demonstrating a causal con-\nnection cannot make out a prima facie case of disparate \nimpact.  For instance, a plaintiff challenging the decision\nof a private developer to construct a new building in one \nlocation  rather  than  another  will  not  easily  be  able  to \nshow this is a policy causing a disparate impact because \nsuch a one-time decision may not be a policy at all.  It may\nalso be difficult to establish causation because of the mul-\n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ntiple factors that go into investment decisions about where \nto  construct  or  renovate  housing  units.    And  as  Judge\nJones observed below, if the ICP cannot show a causal  \nconnection between the Department’s policy and a dispar-\nate impact—for instance, because federal law substantially \nlimits  the  Department’s  discretion—that  should  result \nin dismissal of this case.  747 F. 3d, at 283–284 (specially \nconcurring opinion). \n  The FHA imposes a command with respect to disparate-\nimpact  liability.  Here,  that  command  goes  to  a  state \nentity.  In other cases, the command will go to a private\nperson or entity.  Governmental or private policies are not \ncontrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they  \nare  “artificial,  arbitrary,  and  unnecessary  barriers.”  \nGriggs, 401 U. S., at 431.  Difficult questions might arise if \ndisparate-impact liability under the FHA caused race to be \nused and considered in a pervasive and explicit manner to \njustify governmental or private actions that, in fact, tend \nto perpetuate race-based considerations rather than move\nbeyond them.  Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-\nimpact liability to be so expansive as to inject racial con-\nsiderations into every housing decision. \n  The limitations on disparate-impact liability discussed \nhere  are  also  necessary  to  protect  potential  defendants \nagainst abusive disparate-impact claims.  If the specter of \ndisparate-impact litigation causes private developers to no \nlonger construct or renovate housing units for low-income \nindividuals, then the FHA would have undermined its own \npurpose as well as the free-market system.  And as to  \ngovernmental entities, they must not be prevented from \nachieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compli-\nance  with   health  and  safety  codes.    The  Department’s  \namici, in addition to the well-stated principal dissenting \nopinion in this case, see post, at 1–2, 29–30 (opinion of\nALITO, J.), call attention to the decision by the Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit in  Gallagher v.  Magner, \n\n22  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nOpinion of the Court \n\n619 F. 3d 823 (2010).  Although the Court is reluctant to\napprove or disapprove a case that is not pending, it should \nbe noted that Magner  was decided without the cautionary \nstandards announced in this opinion and, in all events, the \ncase was settled by the parties before an ultimate deter-\nmination of disparate-impact liability. \n  Were  standards  for  proceeding  with  disparate-impact \nsuits not to incorporate at least the safeguards discussed \nhere, then disparate-impact liability might displace valid \ngovernmental  and  private  priorities,  rather  than  solely \n“remov[ing]  . . .  artificial,  arbitrary,  and  unnecessary \nbarriers.”  Griggs, 401 U. S., at 431.  And that, in turn, \nwould set our Nation back in its quest to reduce the sali-\nence of race in our social and economic system. \n  It must be noted further that, even when courts do find  \nliability under a disparate-impact theory, their remedial \norders must be consistent with the Constitution.  Remedial  \norders  in  disparate-impact  cases  should  concentrate  on \nthe elimination of the offending practice that “arbitrar[ily] \n. . . operate[s] invidiously to discriminate on the basis  of \nrac[e].”  Ibid.  If additional measures are adopted, courts \nshould strive to design them to eliminate racial disparities \nthrough  race-neutral  means.    See  Richmond  v.  J.  A.  \nCroson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 510 (1989) (plurality opinion) \n(“[T]he  city  has  at  its  disposal  a  whole  array  of  race-\nneutral devices to increase the accessibility of city con-\ntracting opportunities to small entrepreneurs of all races”).  \nRemedial  orders  that  impose  racial  targets  or  quotas \nmight raise more difficult constitutional questions. \n  While the automatic or pervasive injection of race into \npublic and private transactions covered by the FHA has \nspecial dangers, it is also true that race may be considered \nin  certain  circumstances  and  in  a  proper  fashion.    Cf.  \nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School  \nDist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 789 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., con-\ncurring  in  part  and  concurring  in  judgment)  (“School \n\n  Cite as:  576 U.

Just as this Court has  \nnot  “question[ed]  an  employer’s  affirmative  efforts  to \nensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for\npromotions and to participate in the [promotion] process,” \nRicci, 557 U. S., at 585, it likewise does not impugn hous-\ning authorities’ race-neutral efforts to encourage revitali-\nzation of communities that have long suffered the harsh \nconsequences  of  segregated  housing  patterns.  When \nsetting their larger goals, local housing authorities may \nchoose to foster diversity and combat racial isolation with \nrace-neutral tools, and mere awareness of race in attempt-\ning to solve the problems facing inner cities does not doom\nthat endeavor at the outset. \n  The Court holds that disparate-impact claims are cog-\nnizable under the Fair Housing Act upon considering its \nresults-oriented  language,  the  Court’s  interpretation  of \nsimilar language in Title VII and the ADEA, Congress’ \nratification of disparate-impact claims in 1988 against the \nbackdrop of the unanimous view of nine Courts of Appeals, \nand the statutory purpose.  \nIII  \n  In light of the longstanding judicial interpretation of the \nFHA to encompass disparate-impact claims and congres-\nsional reaffirmation of that result, residents and policy-\nmakers have come to rely on the availability of disparate-\nimpact claims.  See Brief for Massachusetts et al. as Amici \nCuriae 2 (“Without disparate impact claims, States and \nothers will be left with fewer crucial tools to combat the  \nkinds of systemic discrimination that the FHA  was in-\ntended to address”).

EEOC, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 21). \n  Much  progress  remains  to  be  made  in  our  Nation’s \ncontinuing struggle against racial isolation.  In striving to \nachieve our “historic commitment to creating an integrated \nsociety,”  Parents  Involved,  supra,  at  797  (KENNEDY,  J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment), we must \nremain wary of policies that reduce homeowners to noth-\ning more than their race.  But since the passage of the \nFair Housing Act in  1968 and  against the backdrop  of \ndisparate-impact  liability  in  nearly  every  jurisdiction, \nmany cities have become more diverse.  The FHA must  \nplay an important part in avoiding the Kerner Commis-\nsion’s grim prophecy that “[o]ur Nation is moving toward \ntwo  societies,  one  black,  one  white—separate  and  un-\nequal.”  Kerner Commission Report 1.

I write separately\nto point out that the foundation on which the Court builds \nits latest disparate-impact regime—Griggs  v.  Duke Power \nCo., 401 U. S. 424 (1971)—is made of sand.  That decision, \nwhich concluded that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964  authorizes  plaintiffs  to  bring  disparate-impact\nclaims,  id.,  at  429–431,  represents  the  triumph  of  an \nagency’s  preferences  over  Congress’  enactment  and  of \nassumption over fact.  Whatever respect Griggs merits as  \na matter of stare decisis, I would not amplify its error by \nimporting  its  disparate-impact  scheme  into  yet  another  \nstatute. \nI \n\nA \n\n  We should drop the pretense that Griggs’ interpretation  \nof Title VII was legitimate.  “The Civil Rights Act of 1964 \ndid not include an express prohibition on policies or prac-\ntices that produce a disparate impact.”  Ricci v. DeStefano, \n557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009).  It did not include an implicit\none  either.    Instead,  Title  VII’s  operative  provision,  42 \nU. S. C. §2000e–2(a) (1964 ed.), addressed only employer \ndecisions motivated by a protected characteristic.  That  \n\n2  TEXAS DEPT.

Section 2000e–2(a)(2) does not make \nunlawful all employment decisions that “limit, segregate, \nor classify . . . employees . . . in any way which would . . . \notherwise adversely affect [an individual’s] status as an\nemployee,” but those that “otherwise adversely affect [an \nindividual’s] status as an employee, because of such indi-\nvidual’s  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  or  national  origin.”   \n(Emphasis added); accord, 78 Stat. 255.

EEOC’s  “own  official  history  of \nthese early years records with unusual candor the com-\nmission’s  fundamental  disagreement  with  its  founding \ncharter, especially Title VII’s literal requirement that the \ndiscrimination  be  intentional.”  H.  Graham,  The  Civil  \nRights Era: Origins and Development of National Policy \n1960–1972, p. 248 (1990).  The Commissioners and their \nlegal staff thought that “discrimination” had become “less \noften  an  individual  act  of  disparate  treatment  flowing\nfrom an evil state of mind” and “more institutionalized.”  \nJackson, EEOC vs. Discrimination, Inc., 75 The Crisis 16  \n(1968).  They  consequently  decided  they  should  target \nemployment practices “which prove to have a demonstra-\nble racial effect  without a clear and convincing business \nmotive.”  Id., at 16–17 (emphasis deleted).  EEOC’s “legal \nstaff was aware from  the beginning that a normal, tradi-\ntional, and literal interpretation of Title VII could blunt \ntheir efforts” to penalize employers for practices that had a \ndisparate impact, yet  chose “to defy Title VII’s restrictions \nand attempt to build a body of case law that would justify \n[their]  focus  on  effects  and  [their]  disregard  of  intent.”  \nGraham, supra, at 248, 250. \n  The lack of legal authority for their agenda apparently \ndid not trouble them much.  For example, Alfred Blum-\nrosen,  one  of  the  principal  creators  of  disparate-impact \nliability at EEOC, rejected what he described as a “defeat-\nist view of Title VII” that saw the statute as a “compro-\nmise” with a limited scope.  A. Blumrosen, Black Employ-\nment and the Law 57–58 (1971).  Blumrosen “felt that \nmost  of  the  problems  confronting  the  EEOC  could  be\nsolved by creative interpretation of Title VII which would \nbe upheld by the courts, partly out of deference to the \nadministrators.”  Id., at 59. \n\n6  TEXAS DEPT.

S. 775, 811, n. 1 (1998) (THOMAS, J., \ndissenting), it repeatedly issued guidelines on the subject \nof disparate impact.  In 1966, for example, EEOC issued \nguidelines suggesting that the use of employment tests in \nhiring decisions could violate Title VII based on disparate \nimpact, notwithstanding the statute’s express statement \nthat “it shall not be an unlawful employment practice . . . \nto give and to act upon the results of any professionally \ndeveloped ability test provided that such test . . . is not \ndesigned,  intended,  or  used   to  discriminate  because  of \nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin,” §2000e–2(h) \n(emphasis added).  See EEOC, Guidelines on Employment \nTesting Procedures 2–4 (Aug. 24, 1966).  EEOC followed \nthis up with a 1970 guideline that was even more explicit, \ndeclaring that, unless certain criteria were met, “[t]he use \nof  any  test  which  adversely  affects  hiring,  promotion, \ntransfer or any other employment or membership oppor-\ntunity of classes protected by title VII constitutes discrim-\nination.”  35 Fed. Reg. 12334 (1970).\n  EEOC was initially hesitant to take its approach to this \nCourt, but the Griggs  plaintiffs forced its hand.  After they \nlost on their disparate-impact argument in the Court of \nAppeals, EEOC’s deputy general counsel urged the plain-\ntiffs  not  to  seek  review  because  he  believed  “‘that  the  \n \nrecord in the case present[ed] a most unappealing situa-\ntion for finding tests unlawful,’” even though he found the \n \nlower court’s adherence to an intent requirement to be \n“‘tragic.’”  Graham, supra, at 385.  The plaintiffs ignored \n   \nhis advice.

The Court embraced EEOC’s  \ntheory of disparate impact, concluding that the agency’s \nposition was “entitled to great deference.”  See Griggs, 401 \nU. S., at 433–434.  With only a brief nod to the text of \n§2000e–2(a)(2) in a footnote, id., at 426, n. 1, the Court \ntied this novel theory of discrimination to “the statute’s \nperceived purpose” and EEOC’s view of the best way  of \neffectuating  it,  Smith,  544  U.

Additionally, just nine days after we  \ngranted a writ of certiorari in Magner, and before its dismissal, the De-\npartment of Housing and Urban Development proposed the disparate-\nimpact  regulation  at  issue  in  this  case.

In their quest to eradi-\ncate what  they view as institutionalized discrimination, \ndisparate-impact  proponents  doggedly  assume  that  a \ngiven racial disparity at an institution is a product of that \ninstitution rather than a reflection of disparities that exist \noutside of it.  See T. Sowell, Intellectuals and Race 132 \n(2013)  (Sowell).  That  might  be  true,  or  it  might  not.  \nStanding alone, the fact that a practice has a disparate \nimpact  is  not  conclusive  evidence,  as  the  Griggs  Court \nappeared to believe, that a practice is “discriminatory,” \n401  U.

And if that \n“racial  balancing”  is  achieved  through  disparate-impact \nclaims limited to only some groups—if, for instance, white \nbasketball players cannot bring disparate-impact suits—\nthen we as a Court have constructed a scheme that parcels \nout  legal  privileges  to  individuals  on  the  basis  of  skin \ncolor.  A problem with doing so should be obvious: “Gov-\nernment action that classifies individuals on the basis of \nrace is inherently suspect.”  Schuette v. BAMN, 572 U.

In Smith, for example, a plurality of this \nCourt relied on Griggs to include disparate-impact liability\nin the ADEA.  See 544 U. S., at 236.  As both I and the \nauthor of today’s majority opinion recognized at the time, \nthat decision was as incorrect as it was regrettable.  See  \nid.,  at  248–249  (O’Connor,  J.,  joined  by  KENNEDY  and \nTHOMAS, JJ., concurring in judgment).  Because we knew \nthat  Congress  did  not  create  disparate-impact  liability \nunder Title VII, we explained that “there [wa]s no reason\nto  suppose  that  Congress  in  1967”—four  years  before \nGriggs—“could have foreseen the interpretation of Title \nVII that was to come.”  Smith, supra, at 260 (opinion of \nO’Connor, J.).  It made little sense to repeat Griggs’ error \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  11  \n \nTHOMAS,  J., dissenting  \nin a new context.  \n  My position remains the same.  Whatever deference is \ndue Griggs  as a matter of stare decisis, we should at the \nvery least confine it to Title VII.  We should not incorpo-\nrate it into statutes such as the Fair Housing Act and the \nADEA, which were passed years before Congress had any \nreason to suppose that this Court would take the position \nit did in Griggs.  See Smith, supra, at 260 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.).  And we should certainly not allow it to \nspread to statutes like the Fair Housing Act, whose opera-\ntive text, unlike that of the ADEA’s, does not even mirror  \nTitle VII’s. \n  Today, however, the majority inexplicably declares that\n“the logic of Smith and Griggs” leads to the conclusion that  \n“the FHA encompasses disparate-impact claims.”  Ante, at \n11.  JUSTICE  ALITO ably dismantles this argument.  Post, \nat 21–28 (dissenting opinion). But, even if the majority \nwere correct, I would not join it in following that “logic” \nhere.  “[E]rroneous precedents need not be extended to \ntheir logical end, even when dealing with related provi-\nsions  that  normally  would  be  interpreted  in  lockstep.  \nOtherwise,  stare  decisis,  designed  to  be  a  principle  of \nstability and repose, would become a vehicle of change . . . \ndistorting the law.”  CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 \nU. S. 442, 469–470 (2008) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (foot-\nnote  omitted).  Making  the  same  mistake  in  different \nareas  of  the  law  furthers  neither  certainty  nor  judicial  \neconomy.  It furthers error. \n  That error will take its toll.  The recent experience of\nthe Houston Housing Authority (HHA) illustrates some of \nthe many costs of disparate-impact liability.  HHA, which \nprovides affordable housing developments to low-income \nresidents of Houston, has over 43,000 families on its wait-\ning lists.  The overwhelming majority of those families are  \nblack.  Because Houston is a majority-minority city with \nminority concentrations in all but the more affluent areas, \n\n12  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nTHOMAS,  J., dissenting \n \nany HHA developments built outside of those areas will \nincrease the concentration of racial minorities.  Unsurpris-\ningly, the threat of disparate-impact suits based on those \nconcentrations  has  hindered  HHA’s  efforts  to  provide \naffordable housing.  State and federal housing agencies \nhave refused to approve all but two of HHA’s eight pro-\nposed development projects over the past two years out of \nfears  of  disparate-impact  liability.

That  the  \nmajority believes that these are not “‘dire consequences,’” \n   \nsee ante, at 24, is cold comfort for those who actually need  \na home.  \n*    *    * \n  I agree with the majority that Griggs “provide[s] essen-\ntial background” in this case, ante,  at 10: It shows that our  \ndisparate-impact  jurisprudence  was  erroneous  from  its \ninception.  Divorced from text and reality, driven by an \nagency with its own policy preferences, Griggs bears little \nrelationship  to  the  statutory  interpretation  we  should \nexpect from a court of law.

Yet in Gallagher v.  \nMagner, 619 F. 3d 823 (2010), a case that we agreed to \nreview several Terms ago, the Eighth Circuit held that the \nFair Housing Act (or FHA), 42 U. S. C. §3601 et seq., could \nbe used to attack St. Paul, Minnesota’s efforts to combat  \n“rodent infestation” and other violations of the city’s hous-\ning code.  619 F. 3d, at 830.  The  court agreed that there \nwas no basis to “infer discriminatory intent” on the part of \nSt. Paul.  Id., at 833.  Even so, it concluded that the city’s \n“aggressive enforcement of the Housing Code” was action-\nable because making landlords respond to “rodent infesta-\ntion, missing dead-bolt locks, inadequate sanitation facili-\nties, inadequate heat, inoperable smoke detectors, broken \nor missing doors,” and the like increased the price of rent.  \nId., at 830, 835.  Since minorities were statistically more \nlikely to fall into “the bottom bracket for household ad- \njusted median family income,” they were disproportionately \naffected  by  those  rent  increases,  i.e.,  there  was  a  “dis-\nparate impact.”  Id., at 834.  The upshot was that even St.\nPaul’s good-faith attempt to ensure minimally acceptable \nhousing  for  its  poorest  residents  could  not  ward  off  a\ndisparate-impact lawsuit. \n\n2  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \n  Today, the  Court embraces the same theory that drove  \nthe decision in Magner.1  This is a serious mistake.  The \nFair Housing Act does not create disparate-impact liabil-\nity, nor do this Court’s precedents.

Something \nhas gone badly awry when a city can’t even make slum-\nlords kill rats without fear of a lawsuit.  Because Congress\ndid not authorize any of this, I respectfully dissent. \nI \n  Everyone  agrees  that  the  FHA  punishes  intentional \ndiscrimination.  Treating  someone  “less  favorably  than \nothers because of a protected trait” is “‘the most easily \n \nunderstood  type  of  discrimination.’”  Ricci  v.  DeStefano, \n \n557 U. S. 557, 577 (2009) (quoting  Teamsters v. United  \nStates,  431  U. S.  324,  335,  n. 15  (1977);  some  internal \nquotation  marks  omitted).    Indeed,  this  classic  form  of \ndiscrimination—called  disparate  treatment—is  the  only \none prohibited by the Constitution itself.  See, e.g., Arling-\nton Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., \n429 U. S. 252, 264–265 (1977).  It is obvious that Congress \nintended the FHA to cover disparate treatment. \n  The question presented here, however, is whether the \nFHA  also  punishes  “practices  that  are  not  intended  to \ndiscriminate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse \neffect on minorities.”  Ricci, supra, at 577.  The answer is  \nequally  clear.  The  FHA  does  not  authorize  disparate-\nimpact claims.  No such liability was created when the law\nwas enacted in 1968.  And nothing has happened since \nthen to change the law’s meaning. \n—————— \n1We granted certiorari in Magner v.  Gallagher, 565 U.

The FHA makes it a crime to \nwillfully “interfere with . . . any person because of his race” \n(or other protected characteristic) who is engaging in a \nvariety of real-estate-related activities, such as “selling, \npurchasing, [or] renting” a dwelling.  42 U. S. C. §3631(a).  \nNo one thinks a defendant could be convicted of this crime \nwithout proof that he acted “because of,” i.e., on account of  \nor by reason of, one of the protected characteristics.  But \nthe  critical  language  in  this  section—“because  of ”—is \nidentical to the critical language in the sections at issue in \nthis case.  “One ordinarily assumes” Congress means the\nsame words in the same statute to mean the same thing.  \nUtility Air Regulatory Group v.  EPA, 573 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2014) (slip op., at 15).  There is  no reason to doubt that \nordinary assumption here. \n  Like  the  FHA,  many  other  federal  statutes  use  the \nphrase “because of ” to signify what that phrase means in \nordinary  speech.    For  instance,  the  federal  hate  crime \nstatute, 18 U. S. C. §249, authorizes enhanced sentences \nfor  defendants  convicted  of  committing  certain  crimes \n“because of ” race, color, religion, or other listed character-\nistics.  Hate crimes require bad intent—indeed, that is the \nwhole point of these laws.  See, e.g.,  Wisconsin v. Mitchell, \n508 U. S. 476, 484–485 (1993) (“[T]he same criminal con-\nduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is selected \nbecause of his race or other protected status”).  All of this  \nconfirms that “because of ” in the FHA should be read to  \nmean what it says.  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  7 \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nB \n\n  In an effort to find at least a sliver of support for disparate-\nimpact  liability  in  the  text  of  the  FHA,  the  principal \nrespondent, the Solicitor General, and the Court pounce \non the phrase “make unavailable.”  Under §804(a), it is\nunlawful “[t]o . . . make unavailable . . . a dwelling to any \nperson because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status,\nor  national  origin.”    42  U. S. C.  §3604(a).    See  also \n§3605(a) (barring “discriminat[ion] against any person in \nmaking available such a [housing] transaction . . . because \nof race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or \nnational origin”).  The Solicitor General argues that “[t]he \nplain meaning of the phrase ‘make unavailable’ includes \nactions that  have the result of making housing or transac-\ntions unavailable, regardless of whether the actions were \nintended to have that result.”  Brief for United States as  \nAmicus Curiae 18 (emphasis added).  This argument is not\nconsistent with ordinary English usage. \n  It  is  doubtful  that  the  Solicitor  General’s  argument \naccurately  captures  the  “plain  meaning”  of  the  phrase \n“make unavailable” even when that phrase is not linked to \nthe phrase “because of.”  “[M]ake unavailable” must be \nviewed together with the rest of the actions covered by \n§804(a), which applies when a party “refuse[s] to sell or  \nrent”  a  dwelling,  “refuse[s]   to  negotiate  for  the  sale  or \nrental” of a dwelling, “den[ies] a dwelling to any person,” \n“or otherwise make[s]  unavailable” a dwelling.  §3604(a)\n(emphasis added).  When a statute contains a list like this, \nwe “avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it \nis inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving \n‘unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.’ ”  Gustafson  \n \nv. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995) (quoting Jarecki  v.  \nG. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961)).  See also, \ne.g.,  Yates v. United States, 574 U.

OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nthat  precede  “make  unavailable”  unmistakably  describe  \nintentional  deprivations  of  equal  treatment,  not  merely \nactions that happen to have a disparate effect.  See Ameri-\ncan Ins. Assn., ___ F. Supp. 3d, at ___, 2014 WL 5802283, \nat *8 (citing Webster’s Third New International Dictionary \n603, 848, 1363, 1910 (1966)).  Section 804(a), moreover,\nprefaces  “make  unavailable”  with  “or  otherwise,”  thus \ncreating a catchall.  Catchalls must be read “restrictively” \nto be “like” the listed terms.  Washington State Dept. of  \nSocial and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Kef-\nfeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384–385 (2003).  The result of these \nordinary rules of interpretation is that even without “be-\ncause  of,”  the  phrase  “make  unavailable”  likely  would  \nrequire intentionality.\n  The FHA’s inclusion of “because of,” however, removes  \nany doubt.  Sections 804(a) and 805(a) apply only when a \nparty makes a dwelling or transaction unavailable “be-\ncause  of ”  race  or  another  protected  characteristic.    In \nordinary English usage, when a person makes something \nunavailable “because of ” some factor, that factor must be a  \nreason for the act. \n  Here is an example.  Suppose that Congress increases \nthe minimum wage.  Some economists believe that such \nlegislation  reduces the number of jobs available for “un-\nskilled  workers,”  Fuller  &  Geide-Stevenson,  Consensus \nAmong Economists: Revisited, 34 J. Econ.

Of the 32 college players selected by\nNational Football League (NFL) teams in the first round \nof the 2015 draft, it appears that the overwhelming major-\nity were members of racial minorities.  See Draft 2015,  \nhttp://www.nfl.com/draft/2015.  See also Miller, Powerful  \nSports Agents Representing Color, Los Angeles Sentinel, \nFeb. 6, 2014, p. B3 (noting “there are 96 players (76 of \nwhom are African-American) chosen in the first rounds of \nthe 2009, 2010, and 2011 NFL drafts”).  Teams presuma-\nbly chose the players they think are most likely to help \nthem win games.  Would anyone say the NFL teams made \ndraft slots unavailable to white players “because of ” their \nrace?  \n  A third example.  During the present Court Term, of the \n21 attorneys from the Solicitor General’s Office who ar-\ngued cases in this Court, it appears that all but 5 (76%) \nwere under the age of 45.  Would the Solicitor General say\nhe  made  argument  opportunities  unavailable  to  older \nattorneys “because of ” their age? \n  The text of the FHA simply cannot be twisted to author-\nize disparate-impact claims.  It is hard to imagine how \nCongress could have more clearly stated that the FHA \nprohibits only intentional discrimination than by forbid-\nding acts done “because of race, color, religion,  sex, familial \nstatus, or national origin.” \nII  \n  The circumstances in which the FHA was enacted only \nconfirm what the text says.  In 1968, “the predominant\nfocus of antidiscrimination law was on intentional discrim-\nination.”  Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 258  \n(2005) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  The very\n“concept  of  disparate  impact  liability,  by  contrast,  was \nquite novel.”  Ibid. (collecting citations).  See also Tr. of \nOral Arg. 15 (“JUSTICE GINSBURG: . . .

It is anachronistic to think that Congress author-\nized disparate-impact claims in 1968 but packaged that \nstriking innovation so imperceptibly in the FHA’s text. \n  Eradicating intentional discrimination was and is the \nFHA’s strategy for providing fair housing opportunities for  \nall.  The Court recalls the country’s shameful history of \nsegregation and de jure housing discrimination and then \njumps to the conclusion that the FHA authorized disparate-\nimpact  claims  as  a  method  of  combatting  that  evil. \nAnte, at 5–7.  But the fact that the 1968 Congress sought \nto  end  housing  discrimination  says  nothing  about  the \nmeans it devised to achieve that end.  The FHA’s text \nplainly identifies the weapon Congress chose—outlawing \ndisparate treatment “because of race” or another protected \ncharacteristic.   42 U.  S.  C. §§3604(a), 3605(a).  Accordingly, \nin  any  FHA  claim,  “[p]roof  of  discriminatory  motive  is \ncritical.”  Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 335, n. 15.  \nIII  \n  Congress  has  done  nothing  since  1968  to  change  the \nmeaning of the FHA prohibitions at issue in this case.  In \n1968, those prohibitions forbade certain housing practices \nif they were done “because of ” protected characteristics.  \nToday, they still forbid certain housing practices if done \n“because of ” protected characteristics.  The meaning of the \nunaltered language adopted in 1968 has not evolved.\n  Rather than confronting the plain text of §§804(a) and \n805(a), the Solicitor General and the Court place heavy\nreliance  on  certain  amendments  enacted  in  1988,  but \nthose  amendments  did  not  modify  the  meaning  of  the \nprovisions now before us.  In the Fair Housing Amend-\nments Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 1619, Congress expanded the \nlist of protected characteristics.  See 42 U. S. C. §§3604(a),  \n(f)(1).  Congress also gave the Department of Housing and  \n \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  11  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \nUrban Development (HUD) rulemaking authority and the \npower to adjudicate certain housing claims.  See §§3612, \n3614a.  And, what is most relevant for present purposes, \nCongress  added  three  safe-harbor  provisions,  specifying \nthat “[n]othing in [the FHA]” prohibits (a) certain actions \ntaken by real property appraisers, (b) certain occupancy \nrequirements, and (c) the treatment of persons convicted \nof manufacturing or distributing illegal drugs.3  \n  According to the Solicitor General and the Court, these \namendments  show  that  the  FHA  authorizes  disparate-\nimpact claims.  Indeed, the Court says that they are “of \ncrucial importance.”  Ante, at 13.  This “crucial” argument, \nhowever, cannot stand. \nA \n  The Solicitor General and the Court contend that the \n1988  Congress  implicitly  authorized  disparate-impact \nliability  by  adopting  the  amendments  just  noted  while \nleaving the operative provisions of the FHA untouched.  \nCongress  knew  at  that  time,  they  maintain,  that  the \nCourts  of  Appeals  had  held  that  the  FHA  sanctions \ndisparate-impact claims, but Congress failed to enact bills \nthat would have rejected that theory of liability.  Based on \nthis,  they  submit  that  Congress  silently  ratified  those \n—————— \n3These new provisions state:\n \n“Nothing in this subchapter prohibits a person engaged in the busi-\nness of furnishing appraisals of real property to take into consideration \nfactors other than race, color, religion,  national origin, sex, handicap, or \nfamilial status.” §3605(c). \n“Nothing in this subchapter limits the applicability of any reasonable \nlocal, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of \noccupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.  Nor does any provision in \nthis subchapter regarding familial status apply with respect to housing \nfor older persons.”  §3607(b)(1). \n“Nothing in this subchapter prohibits conduct against a person be-\ncause such person has been convicted by any court of competent juris-\ndiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a  controlled sub-\nstance as defined in section  802 of title 21.”  §3607(b)(4).  \n\n12  TEXAS DEPT.

This argument is deeply flawed. \n   Not the greatest of its defects is its assessment of what \nCongress must have known about the judiciary’s interpre-\ntation of the FHA.   The Court writes that by 1988, “all  \nnine Courts of Appeals  to have addressed the question had \nconcluded the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate-\nimpact claims.”  Ante, at 13 (emphasis added).  See also \nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.  But  this  \nCourt had not addressed that question.  While we always\ngive respectful consideration to interpretations of statutes \nthat garner wide acceptance in other courts, this Court \nhas “no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on the \nground that other courts have done so,” even if they have \n“‘consistently’” done so for “‘30 years.’”  Milner v. Depart-\n       \nment of Navy, 562 U. S. 562, 575–576 (2011).  See also,  \ne.g.,   CSX  Transp.,  Inc.  v.  McBride,  564  U. S.  ___,  ___ \n(2011) (ROBERTS, C.

West  Virginia  Dept.  of  Health  and  \nHuman Resources, 532 U. S. 598 (2001); McNally v. United \nStates, 483 U. S. 350 (1987))). \n  In  any  event,  there  is  no  need  to  ponder  whether  it \nwould have been reasonable for the 1988 Congress, with-\nout considering the clear meaning of §§804(a) and 805(a), \nto assume that the decisions of the lower courts effectively \nsettled the matter.  While the Court highlights the deci-\nsions of the Courts of Appeals, it fails to mention some-\nthing that is of at least equal  importance: The official view \nof the United States in 1988. \nShortly before the 1988 amendments were adopted, the \nUnited States formally argued in this Court that the FHA\nprohibits only intentional discrimination.

S. ____ (2015)  13  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \n(“An action taken because of some factor other than race, \ni.e., financial means, even if it causes a discriminatory\neffect, is not an example of the intentional discrimination \noutlawed by the statute”); id., at 14 (“The words ‘because \nof ’ plainly connote a causal connection between the housing-\nrelated  action  and  the  person’s  race  or  color”).4    This  \nwas the same position that the United States had taken in \nlower courts for years.  See, e.g.,  United States v. Bir-\nmingham, 538 F. Supp. 819, 827, n. 9 (ED Mich. 1982) \n(noting positional change), aff ’d, 727 F. 2d 560, 565–566  \n(CA6  1984)  (adopting  United  States’  “concession”  that \nthere must be a “‘discriminatory motive’”).  It is implausi-\n   \nble that the 1988 Congress was aware of certain lower \ncourt decisions but oblivious to the United States’ consid-\nered and public view that those decisions were wrong. \n  This fact is fatal to any notion that Congress implicitly \nratified disparate impact in 1988.  The canon of interpre-\ntation on which the Court and the Solicitor General pur-\nport  to  rely—the  so-called  “prior-construction  canon”—\ndoes not apply where lawyers cannot “justifiably regard \nthe point as settled” or when “other sound rules of inter-\npretation” are implicated.  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 324, 325 (2012).  \nThat was the case here.  Especially after the United States \nbegan  repudiating  disparate  impact,  no  one  could  have \nreasonably thought that the question was settled. \n  Nor can such a faulty argument be salvaged by pointing \nto Congress’ failure in 1988 to enact language that would \nhave  made  it  clear  that  the  FHA  does  not  authorize \ndisparate-impact suits based on zoning decisions.  See ante, \n—————— \n4In response to the United  States’ argument, we reserved decision on \n \nthe question. See Huntington v. Huntington Branch, NAACP, 488 U.

See, e.g., West Virginia Univ.  \nHospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 100, 101, and n. 7 \n(1991).  Intent that finds no expression in  a statute is \nirrelevant.  See, e.g., New York Telephone Co. v. New York  \nState  Dept.  of  Labor,  440  U. S.  519,  544–545  (1979); \nEasterbrook, Statutes’ Domains, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533,  \n538–540 (1983).  Hence, “we walk on quicksand when we\ntry to find in the absence of corrective legislation a control-\nling legal principle.”  Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106,  \n121 (1940).\n  Unsurprisingly, we have rejected identical arguments \nabout implicit ratification in other cases.  For example, in \nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of \nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994), a party argued that \n§10(b)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  imposes \nliability on aiders and abettors because “Congress ha[d] \namended the securities laws on various occasions since \n1966, when courts first began to interpret §10(b) to cover \naiding and abetting, but ha[d] done so without providing \nthat aiding and abetting liability is not available under \n§10(b).”  Id.,  at 186.  “From that,” a party asked the Court \n—————— \n5In any event, the Court overstates the importance of that failed \n \namendment. The amendment’s sponsor disavowed that it had anything \nto do with the broader question whether the FHA authorizes disparate-\nimpact suits.  Rather, it “left to caselaw and eventual Supreme Court \nresolution whether a discriminatory intent or discriminatory effects \nstandard  is appropriate . . . [in] all situations but zoning.”  H. R. Rep.  \nNo. 100–711, p. 89 (1988).  Some in  Congress, moreover, supported the  \namendment and the House bill.  Compare ibid. with  134 Cong. Rec.  \n16511 (1988).  It is hard to believe they thought the bill—which was \nsilent on disparate impact—nonetheless decided the broader question.  \nIt is for such reasons that failed amendments tell us “little” about what  \na statute means.

We rejected \nthat argument out of hand.

As just explained, however, \nwhat matters is what Congress did, not what it might \nhave “assumed.”  And although the Court characterizes  \n\n16  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nthese provisions as “exemptions,” that characterization is \ninaccurate.  They make no reference to §804(a) or §805(a) \nor any other provision of the FHA; nor do they state that \nthey apply to conduct that would otherwise be prohibited.  \nInstead, they simply make clear that certain conduct is \nnot  forbidden  by  the  Act.  E.g.,  42  U. S. C.   §3607(b)(4) \n(“Nothing in this subchapter prohibits . . .”).  The Court \nshould read these amendments to mean what they say. \n   In  1988,  policymakers  were  not  of  one  mind  about \ndisparate-impact housing suits.  Some favored the theory \nand presumably would have been happy to have it en-\nshrined in the FHA.  See ante, at 13–14; 134 Cong. Rec. \n23711 (1988) (statement of Sen. Kennedy).  Others worried  \nabout disparate-impact liability and recognized that this \nCourt had  not decided whether disparate-impact claims \nwere authorized under the 1968 Act.  See H. R. Rep. No. \n100–711,  pp. 89–93  (1988).    Still  others  disapproved  of \ndisparate-impact liability and believed that the 1968 Act\ndid  not  authorize  it.    That  was  the  view  of  President \nReagan when he signed the amendments.  See Remarks \non Signing the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 24 \nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1140, 1141 (1988) (explaining\nthat the amendments did “not represent any congressional \nor executive branch endorsement of the notion, expressed \nin some judicial opinions, that [FHA] violations may be \nestablished by a showing of disparate impact” because the \nFHA “speaks only to intentional discrimination”).6  \n—————— \n6At the same hearings to which the Court refers, ante, at 13, Senator  \n \nHatch stated that if the “intent test versus the effects test” were to \n“becom[e] an issue,” a “fair housing law” might not be enacted at all, \nand he noted that failed legislation in the past had  gotten “bogged \ndown” because of that “battle.”  Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1987: \nHearings on S. 558 before  the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the \nSenate Committee on  the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1987).  \nHe also noted that the bill under consideration did “not really go one \nway or the other” on disparate impact since the sponsors were content \nto “rely” on the lower court opinions.  Ibid.  And he emphasized that  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  17  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \n  The 1988 safe-harbor provisions have all the hallmarks \nof a compromise among these factions.  These provisions \nneither  authorize  nor  bar  disparate-impact  claims,  but \nthey  do  provide  additional  protection  for  persons  and \nentities engaging in certain practices that Congress espe-\ncially wished to shield.  We “must respect and give effect \nto  these  sorts  of  compromises.”    Ragsdale  v.  Wolverine  \nWorld Wide, Inc., 535 U. S. 81, 93–94 (2002). \n  It is not hard to see why such a compromise was attrac-\ntive.  For Members of Congress who supported disparate \nimpact,  the  safe  harbors  left  the  favorable  lower  court \ndecisions in place.  And for those who hoped that this \nCourt  would  ultimately  agree  with  the  position  being \nurged  by  the  United  States,  those  provisions  were  not \nsurplusage.  In  the  Circuits  in  which  disparate-impact \nFHA liability had been accepted, the safe-harbor provi-\nsions furnished a measure of interim protection until the \nquestion was resolved by this Court.  They also provided\npartial protection in the event that this Court ultimately \nrejected the United States’ argument.  Neither the Court,  \nthe  principal  respondent,  nor  the  Solicitor  General  has \ncited any case in which the canon against surplusage has \nbeen applied in circumstances like these.7  \n—————— \n“the issue of intent versus effect—I am afraid that is going to  have to be \ndecided by the Supreme Court.”  Ibid.

OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \n  On the contrary, we have previously refused to interpret \nenactments like the 1988 safe-harbor provisions in such a  \nway.  Our decision in O’Gilvie v. United  States, 519 U. S.  \n79 (1996)—also ignored by the Court today—is instructive.  \nIn that case, the question was whether a provision of the \nInternal Revenue Code excluding a recovery for personal \ninjury  from  gross  income  applied  to  punitive  damages.  \nWell  after  the  critical  provision  was  enacted,  Congress \nadopted an amendment providing that punitive damages \nfor nonphysical injuries were not excluded.  Pointing to \nthis  amendment,  a  taxpayer  argued:  “Why  . . .  would \nCongress have enacted this amendment removing punitive \ndamages  (in  nonphysical  injury  cases)  unless  Congress \nbelieved that, in the amendment’s absence, punitive dam-\nages did fall within the provision’s coverage?”  Id., at 89.  \nThis  argument,  of  course,  is  precisely  the  same  as  the \nargument made in this case.  To paraphrase  O’Gilvie, the \nCourt today asks: Why would Congress have enacted the \n1988  amendments,  providing  safe  harbors  from  three \ntypes of disparate-impact claims, unless Congress believed \n—————— \nwhich some courts have applied in disparate-treatment housing cases,  \nsee, e.g., 2922 Sherman  Avenue Tenants’  Assn. v.  District of Columbia, \n444 F. 3d 673, 682 (CADC 2006) (collecting  cases), a defendant must \nproffer a legitimate reason for the challenged conduct, and the safe-\nharbor  provisions  set  out  reasons  that  are  necessarily  legitimate.  \nMoreover, while a factfinder in a disparate-treatment case can some-\ntimes infer bad intent based on facially neutral conduct, these safe \nharbors protect against such inferences.  Without more, conduct within  \na safe harbor is insufficient to support such an inference as a matter of \nlaw.  And finally, even if there is additional evidence, these safe har-\nbors make it harder to show pretext.  See Fair Housing Advocates \nAssn., Inc. v.  Richmond Heights, 209 F. 3d 626, 636–637, and n.  7 (CA6  \n2000). \nEven if they were superfluous, moreover, our “preference for avoiding \nsurplusage constructions is not absolute.”  Lamie v.

S. ____ (2015)  19  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \nthat,  in  the  amendments’  absence,  disparate-impact\nclaims did fall within the FHA’s coverage? \n  The Court rejected the argument in O’Gilvie.  “The short \nanswer,” the Court wrote, is that Congress might have \nsimply wanted to “clarify the matter in respect to non-\nphysical injuries” while otherwise “leav[ing] the law where \nit  found  it.”     Ibid.    Although  other  aspects  of  O’Gilvie  \ntriggered a  dissent, see id., at 94–101 (opinion of SCALIA, \nJ.), no one quarreled with this self-evident piece of the \nCourt’s analysis.  Nor was the O’Gilvie Court troubled that  \nCongress’  amendment  regarding  nonphysical  injuries\nturned  out  to  have  been  unnecessary  because  punitive \ndamages for any injuries were not excluded all along. \n  The Court saw the flaw in the argument in O’Gilvie, and \nthe  same  argument  is  no  better  here.    It  is  true  that  \nO’Gilvie involved a dry question of tax law while this case \ninvolves a controversial civil rights issue.  But how we \nread statutes should not turn on such distinctions. \n  In sum, as the principal respondent’s attorney candidly \nadmitted, the 1988 amendments did not create disparate-\nimpact liability.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 36 (“[D]id the things \nthat [Congress] actually did in 1988 expand the coverage \nof the Act?  MR. DANIEL: No, Justice”). \nC \n  The principal respondent and the Solicitor General—but \nnot the Court—have one final argument regarding the text \nof the FHA.  They maintain that even if the FHA does not \nunequivocally  authorize  disparate-impact  suits,  it  is  at \nleast  ambiguous  enough  to  permit  HUD  to  adopt  that \ninterpretation.  Even if the FHA were ambiguous, how-\never, we do not defer “when there is reason to suspect that \nthe agency’s interpretation ‘does not reflect the agency’s \nfair and considered judgment on the matter in question.’” \n \nChristopher v.

OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \n  Here, 43 years after the FHA was enacted and nine days \nafter the Court granted certiorari in Magner (the “rodent \ninfestation”  case),  HUD  proposed  “to  prohibit  housing \npractices with a discriminatory effect, even where there \nhas been no intent to discriminate.”  Implementation of \nthe Fair Housing Act’s Discriminatory Effects Standard, \n76  Fed.  Reg.  70921  (2011).  After  Magner  settled,  the \nCourt  called  for  the  views  of  the  Solicitor  General  in \nTownship of Mount Holly v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in  \nAction, Inc., 568 U. S. ___ (2012), another case raising the \nsame question.  Before the Solicitor General filed his brief,  \nhowever, HUD adopted disparate-impact regulations.  See \nImplementation of the Fair Housing Act’s Discriminatory \nEffects Standard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460 (2013).  The Solicitor \nGeneral then urged HUD’s rule as a reason to deny certio-\nrari.  We granted certiorari anyway, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), \nand  shortly  thereafter  Mount  Holly  also   unexpectedly \nsettled.  Given this unusual pattern, there is an argument \nthat deference may be unwarranted.  Cf. Young v. United \nParcel Service, Inc., 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at \n16–17) (refusing to defer where “[t]he EEOC promulgated \nits  2014  guidelines  only  recently,  after  this  Court  had \ngranted certiorari” (discussing Skidmore v. Swift & Co., \n323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944))).8  \n  There is no need to dwell on these circumstances, how-\never, because deference is inapt for a more familiar rea-\nson: The FHA is not ambiguous.  The FHA prohibits only \ndisparate treatment, not disparate impact.  It is a bedrock \nrule  that  an  agency  can  never  “rewrite  clear  statutory \nterms  to  suit  its  own  sense  of  how  the  statute  should \n—————— \n8At argument, the Government assured the Court that HUD did not \n \npromulgate its proposed rule because of Magner.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. \n46 (“[I]t overestimates the efficiency of the government to think that \nyou could get, you know, a supposed rule-making on an issue like this \nout within seven days”).  The Government also argued that HUD had \nrecognized disparate-impact liability in adjudications for years.  Ibid.  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U.

This rule makes even more sense where \nthe agency’s view would open up a deeply disruptive ave-\nnue of liability that Congress never contemplated. \nIV \n  Not only does disparate-impact liability run headlong \ninto the text of the FHA, it also is irreconcilable with our  \nprecedents.  The Court’s decision today reads far too much \ninto Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971), and \nfar too little into Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228 \n(2005).  In Smith, the Court explained that the statutory \njustification  for  the  decision  in  Griggs  depends  on  lan-\nguage that has no parallel in the FHA.  And when the \nSmith Court addressed a provision that does have such a \nparallel in the FHA, the Court concluded—unanimously— \nthat it does not authorize disparate-impact liability.  The \nsame result should apply here. \nA \n  Rather than focusing on the text of the FHA, much of \nthe Court’s reasoning today turns on Griggs.  In  Griggs, \nthe Court held that black employees who sued their em-\nployer under §703(a)(2) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(2), could recover without \nproving  that  the  employer’s  conduct—requiring  a  high \nschool diploma or a qualifying grade on a  standardized \ntest as a condition for certain jobs—was motivated by a \ndiscriminatory intent.  Instead, the Court held that, un-\nless  it  was  proved  that  the  requirements were  “job  re- \nlated,” the plaintiffs could recover by showing that the re- \nquirements  “operated  to  render  ineligible  a  markedly \ndisproportionate number of Negroes.”  401 U. S., at 429. \n  Griggs  was a case in which an intent to discriminate  \nmight well have been inferred.  The company had “openly\ndiscriminated on the basis of race” prior to the date on \n\n22  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nwhich the 1964 Civil Rights Act took effect.  Id., at 427.   \nOnce that date arrived, the company imposed new educa-\ntional requirements for those wishing to transfer into jobs \nthat were then being performed by white workers who did \nnot meet those requirements.  Id., at 427–428.  These new \nhurdles  disproportionately  burdened  African-Americans, \nwho had “long received inferior education in segregated \nschools.”  Id., at 430.  Despite all this, the lower courts \nfound that the company lacked discriminatory intent.  See  \nid., at 428.  By convention, we do not overturn a finding of \nfact  accepted  by  two  lower  courts,  see,  e.g.,   Rogers  v.  \nLodge, 458 U. S. 613, 623 (1982); Blau v. Lehman, 368 \nU. S.  403,  408–409  (1962);  Graver  Tank  &  Mfg.  Co.  v.  \nLinde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949), so the \nCourt was confronted with the question whether Title VII \nalways demands intentional discrimination. \nAlthough Griggs involved a question of statutory inter-\npretation, the body of the Court’s opinion—quite remarka-\nbly—does not even cite the provision of Title VII on which \nthe plaintiffs’ claims were based.  The only reference to \n§703(a)(2) of the 1964 Civil Rights Act appears in a single \nfootnote that reproduces the statutory text but makes no \neffort to explain how it encompasses a disparate-impact \nclaim.  See 401 U. S., at 426, n.  1.  Instead, the Court \nbased its decision on the “objective” of Title VII, which the \nCourt  described  as  “achiev[ing]  equality  of  employment \nopportunities and remov[ing] barriers that have operated \nin the past to favor an identifiable group of white employ-\nees over other employees.”  Id., at 429–430. \n  That  text-free  reasoning  caused  confusion,  see,   e.g.,  \nSmith,  supra,  at  261–262  (O’Connor,  J.,  concurring  in \njudgment), and undoubtedly led to the pattern of Court of \nAppeals decisions in FHA cases upon which the majority \nnow relies.  Those lower courts, like the Griggs  Court, \noften made little effort to ground their decisions in the \nstatutory text.  For example, in one of the earliest cases in  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  23  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \nthis line, United States v. Black Jack, 508 F. 2d 1179 (CA8 \n1974), the heart of the court’s analysis was this: “Just as \nCongress requires ‘the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and \nunnecessary  barriers  to  employment  when  the  barriers \noperate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or \nother impermissible classification,’ such barriers must also \ngive way in the field of housing.”  Id., at 1184 (quoting \nGriggs, supra, at 430–431; citation omitted). \n  Unlike  these  lower  courts,  however,  this  Court  has  \nnever interpreted Griggs as imposing a rule that applies to \nall antidiscrimination statutes.  See, e.g., Guardians Assn.  \nv. Civil Serv. Comm’n of New York City, 463 U. S. 582,  \n607, n. 27 (1983) (holding that Title VI, 42 U. S. C. §2000d \net seq.,  does “not allow compensatory relief in the absence \nof proof of discriminatory intent”); Sandoval, 532 U. S., at  \n280 (similar).  Indeed, we have  never held that Griggs  \neven establishes a rule for all employment discrimination \nstatutes.  In Teamsters,  the  Court  rejected  “the Griggs \nrationale” in evaluating a company’s seniority rules.  431  \nU. S., at 349–350.  And because Griggs was focused on a  \nparticular problem, the Court had held that its rule does \nnot apply where, as here, the context is different.  In Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. \n702 (1978), for instance, the Court refused to apply Griggs \nto pensions under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U. S. C. \n§206(d) or Title VII, even if a plan has a “disproportion- \nately heavy impact on male employees.” 435 U. S. at 711, \nn. 20.  We  explained  that  “[e]ven  a  completely  neutral \npractice will inevitably have some disproportionate impact \non one group or another.  Griggs does not imply, and this \nCourt has never held, that discrimination must always be \ninferred from such consequences.”   Ibid.  \nB \n  Although the opinion in  Griggs  did not grapple with the \ntext of the provision at issue, the Court was finally re-\n\n24  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nquired to face that task in Smith, 544 U. S. 228, which  \naddressed whether the Age Discrimination in Employment \nAct of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §621 et seq., authorizes \ndisparate-impact suits.  The Court considered two provi-\nsions  of  the  ADEA,  §§4(a)(1)  and  4(a)(2),  29  U. S. C. \n§§623(a)(1) and (a)(2). \n  The Court unanimously agreed that the first of these \nprovisions, §4(a)(1), does not authorize disparate-impact \nclaims.  See 544 U. S., at 236, n. 6 (plurality opinion); id., \nat 243 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in \njudgment) (agreeing with the plurality’s reasoning); id., at \n249 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (reasoning that \nthis  provision  “obvious[ly]”  does  not  allow  disparate-\nimpact claims).\n  By contrast, a majority of the Justices found that the \nterms of §4(a)(2) either clearly authorize disparate-impact \nclaims (the position of the plurality) or at least are ambig-\nuous enough to provide a basis for deferring to such an \ninterpretation  by  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity \nCommission (the position of JUSTICE SCALIA).  See 544 \nU. S., at 233–240 (plurality opinion); id., at 243–247 (opin-\nion of SCALIA, J.).\n  In reaching this conclusion, these Justices reasoned that \n§4(a)(2)  of  the  ADEA  was  modeled  on  and  is  virtually \nidentical to the provision in Griggs, 42 U. S. C. §2000e– \n2(a)(2).  Section 4(a)(2) provides as follows: \n  “It shall be unlawful for an employer— \n.         .         .         .         .  \n  “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in \nany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise \nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of\nsuch individual’s age.”  29 U. S. C. §623(a) (emphasis \nadded). \n  The provision of Title VII at issue in Griggs says this: \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  25  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \n  “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an \nemployer— \n.         .         .         .         .  \n  “(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or \napplicants for employment in any way which would \ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-\nment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his \nstatus as an employee, because of such individual’s  \nrace,  color,  religion,  sex,  or  national  origin.”  42 \nU. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(2) (emphasis added). \n  For purposes here, the only relevant difference between \nthese provisions is that the ADEA provision refers to “age” \nand the Title VII provision refers to “race, color, religion, \nor  national  origin.”  Because  identical  language  in  two \nstatutes  having  similar  purposes  should  generally  be \npresumed  to  have  the  same  meaning,  the  plurality  in \nSmith, echoed by JUSTICE SCALIA, saw Griggs as “compel-\nling” support for the conclusion that §4(a)(2) of the ADEA \nauthorizes disparate-impact claims.  544 U.  S., at 233–234  \n(plurality opinion) (citing Northcross v. Board of Ed. of  \nMemphis  City  Schools,  412  U. S.  427,  428  (1973)  (per \ncuriam)). \n  When it came to the other ADEA  provision addressed in  \nSmith, namely, §4(a)(1), the Court unanimously reached \nthe opposite conclusion.  Section 4(a)(1) states: \n  “It shall be unlawful for an employer— \n  “(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any indi-\nvidual or otherwise discriminate against any individ-\nual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\ntions,  or  privileges  of  employment,  because  of  such \nindividual’s  age.”  29  U. S. C.  §623(a)(1)  (emphasis \nadded).  \n  The plurality opinion’s reasoning, with which JUSTICE \nSCALIA   agreed,  can  be  summarized  as  follows.    Under \n§4(a)(1), the employer  must act because of age, and thus  \n\n26  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nmust have discriminatory intent.  See 544 U. S., at 236, n. \n6.9  Under §4(a)(2), on the other hand, it is enough if the  \nemployer’s  actions   “adversely  affect”  an  individual  “be-\ncause of . . . age.”  29 U. S. C. §623(a).\n  This analysis of §§4(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the ADEA con-\nfirms  that  the  FHA  does  not  allow  disparate-impact\nclaims.  Sections 804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA resemble\n§4(a)(1) of the ADEA, which the  Smith Court unanimously \nagreed  does  not  encompass  disparate-impact  liability.  \nUnder these provisions of the FHA, like §4(a)(1) of the \nADEA, a defendant must act “because of ” race or one of \nthe other prohibited grounds.  That is, it is unlawful for a \nperson or entity to “[t]o refuse to sell or rent,” “refuse to \nnegotiate,” “otherwise make unavailable,” etc. for a forbid-\nden reason.  These provisions of the FHA, unlike the Title \nVII provision in Griggs or §4(a)(2) of the ADEA, do not \nmake it unlawful to take an action that happens to ad-\nversely affect a person because of race, religion, etc. \nThe Smith  plurality’s analysis, moreover, also depended \non other language, unique to the ADEA, declaring that “it \nshall not be unlawful for an employer ‘to take any action \notherwise prohibited . . . where the differentiation is based  \n—————— \n9The plurality stated:\n \n  “Paragraph (a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer ‘to fail or refuse \nto hire . . . any individual . . . because of such individual’s age.’  (Em-\nphasis added.)  The focus of the paragraph is on the employer’s actions \nwith respect to the targeted individual.  Paragraph (a)(2), however, \nmakes it unlawful for an employer ‘to limit . . . his employees in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employ-\nment  opportunities  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  his  status  as   an \nemployee, because of such individual’s age.’  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike \nin paragraph (a)(1), there is thus an incongruity between the employ-\ner’s actions—which are focused on his employees generally—and the \nindividual employee who adversely suffers because of those actions.  \nThus, an employer who classifies his employees without respect to age \nmay still be liable under the terms of this paragraph if such classifica-\ntion adversely affects the employee because of that employee’s age—the \nvery definition of disparate impact.”  544 U. S., at 236, n. 6. \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  27  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \non reasonable factors other than age.’”  544 U. S., at 238 \n \n(quoting 81 Stat. 603; emphasis added).  This “otherwise  \nprohibited”  language  was  key  to  the  plurality  opinion’s \nreading  of  the  statute  because  it  arguably  suggested \ndisparate-impact liability.  See 544 U. S., at 238.  This  \nlanguage,  moreover,  was  essential  to  JUSTICE  SCALIA’s \ncontrolling opinion.  Without it, JUSTICE  SCALIA would have \nagreed  with  Justices  O’Connor,  KENNEDY,  and  THOMAS  \nthat  nothing  in  the  ADEA  authorizes  disparate-impact  \nsuits.  See id., at 245–246.  In fact, even with this “other-\nwise  prohibited”  language,  JUSTICE  SCALIA  merely  con-\ncluded that §4(a)(2) was ambiguous—not that disparate-\nimpacts suits are required.  Id., at 243. \n  The FHA does not contain any phrase like “otherwise \nprohibited.”  Such  language  certainly  is  nowhere  to  be\nfound in §§804(a) and 805(a).  And for all the reasons  \nalready explained, the 1988 amendments do not presup-\npose disparate-impact liability.  To the contrary, legisla-\ntive enactments declaring only that certain actions are not  \ngrounds for liability do not implicitly create a new theory\nof liability that all other facets of the statute foreclose.  \nC \n  This  discussion  of  our  cases  refutes  any  notion  that \n“[t]ogether,   Griggs  holds[10]  and  the  plurality  in  Smith  \ninstructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed  \nto  encompass  disparate-impact  claims  when  their  text \nrefers to the consequences of actions and not just to the\nmindset of actors, and where that interpretation is con-\n—————— \n10 Griggs, of course, “holds” nothing of the sort.  Indeed, even the plu-\n \nrality opinion in Smith (to say nothing of JUSTICE SCALIA’s controlling\nopinion or Justice O’Connor’s opinion concurring in the judgment) did \nnot understand Griggs to create such a rule.  See 544 U. S., at 240  \n(plurality  opinion)  (relying  on  multiple  considerations).    If  Griggs \nalready answered the question for all statutes (even those that do not \nuse effects language),  Smith is inexplicable.  \n\n28  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nsistent with statutory purpose.”  Ante, at 10.  The Court \nstumbles in concluding that §804(a) of the FHA is more \nlike §4(a)(2) of the ADEA than §4(a)(1).  The operative \nlanguage in §4(a)(1) of the ADEA—which, per Smith, does \nnot  authorize  disparate-impact  claims—is  materially\nindistinguishable from the operative language in §804(a) \nof the FHA. \n  Even more baffling, neither alone nor in combination do \nGriggs  and  Smith  support  the  Court’s  conclusion  that \n§805(a) of the FHA allows disparate-impact suits.  The \naction forbidden by that provision is “discriminat[ion]  . . . \nbecause of ” race, religion, etc.  42 U. S. C. §3605(a) (em-\nphasis added).  This is precisely the formulation used in \n§4(a)(1) of the ADEA, which prohibits “discriminat[ion]  . . .  \nbecause of such individual’s age,” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1) \n(emphasis added), and which Smith holds does not author-\nize disparate-impact claims. \n  In an effort to explain why §805(a)’s reference to “dis-\ncrimination”  allows  disparate-impact  suits,  the  Court \nargues that in Board of Ed. of City School Dist. of New \nYork v.  Harris, 444 U.  S. 130 (1979), “statutory language \nsimilar to §805(a) [was construed] to include disparate-\nimpact liability.”  Ante, at 11.  In fact, the statutory lan-\nguage in Harris  was quite different.  The law there was \n§706(d)(1)(B) of the 1972 Emergency School Aid Act, which \nbarred assisting education agencies that “ ‘had in effect \n \nany  practice,  policy,  or  procedure  which  results  in  the \ndisproportionate demotion or dismissal of instructional or \nother personnel from minority groups in conjunction with \ndesegregation . . . or otherwise engaged in discrimination \nbased upon race, color, or national origin in the hiring,\npromotion, or assignment of employees.’”  444 U. S., at \n \n132–133, 142 (emphasis added). \n  After stating that the first clause in that unusual stat-\nute referred to a “disparate-impact test,” the Harris Court \nconcluded that “a similar standard” should apply to the  \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  29  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting  \ntextually “closely connected” second clause.  Id., at 143.   \nThis was so, the Court thought,  even though the second \nclause, standing alone, may very well have required dis-\ncriminatory “intent.”  Id., at 139.  The Court explained\nthat the Act’s “less than careful draftsmanship” regarding \nthe relationship between the clauses made the “wording of \nthe  statute  . . .  ambiguous”  about  teacher  assignments, \nthus forcing the Court to “look closely at the structure and \ncontext of the statute and to review its legislative history.”  \nId., at 138–140.  It was the combined force of all those \nmarkers that persuaded the Court that disparate impact \napplied to the second clause too. \n  Harris, in other words, has nothing to do with §805(a) of \nthe FHA.  The “wording” is different; the “structure” is \ndifferent;  the  “context”  is  different;  and  the  “legislative \nhistory” is different.  Id., at 140.   Rather than digging up a \n36-year-old case that Justices of this Court have cited all \nof twice, and never once for the proposition offered today, \nthe Court would do well to recall our many cases explain-\ning what the phase “because of ” means.  \nV \n  Not only is the decision of the Court inconsistent with \nwhat the FHA says and our precedents, it will have unfor-\ntunate consequences.  Disparate-impact liability has very \ndifferent implications in housing and employment cases. \n  Disparate  impact  puts  housing  authorities  in  a  very \ndifficult position because programs that are designed and \nimplemented to help the poor can provide the grounds for \na disparate-impact claim.  As Magner shows, when dis-\nparate  impact  is  on  the  table,  even  a  city’s  good-faith \nattempt to remedy deplorable housing conditions can be \nbranded “discriminatory.”  619 F. 3d, at 834.  Disparate-\nimpact claims thus threaten “a whole range of tax, wel-\nfare,  public  service,  regulatory,  and  licensing  statutes.”   \nWashington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 248 (1976). \n\n30  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \n  This case illustrates the point.  The Texas Department\nof Housing and Community Affairs (the Department) has \nonly so many tax credits to distribute.  If it gives credits \nfor  housing  in  lower  income  areas,  many  families—\nincluding  many  minority  families—will  obtain  better \nhousing.  That is a good thing.  But if the Department \ngives credits for housing in higher income areas, some of \nthose families will be able to afford to move into more \ndesirable neighborhoods.  That is also a good thing.  Either \npath, however, might trigger a disparate-impact suit.11  \n  This is not mere speculation.  Here, one respondent has \nsued the Department for not allocating enough credits to \nhigher income areas.  See Brief for Respondent Inclusive \nCommunities Project, Inc., 23.  But another respondent \nargues that giving credits to wealthy neighborhoods vio-\nlates “the moral imperative to improve the substandard \nand inadequate affordable housing in many of our inner \ncities.”  Reply Brief for Respondent Frazier Revitalization \nInc. 1.  This latter argument has special force because a \ncity can build more housing where property is least expen-\nsive, thus  benefiting more people.  In fact, federal law \noften favors projects that revitalize low-income communi-\nties.  See ante, at 2.  \n  No matter  what the Department decides, one of these \nrespondents will be able to bring a disparate-impact case.  \nAnd if the Department opts to compromise by dividing the \ncredits, both respondents might be able to sue.  Congress \nsurely did not mean to put local governments in such a \nposition.\n  The Solicitor General’s answer to such problems is that \nHUD will come to the rescue.  In particular, HUD regula-\n—————— \n11Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45 (“Community A wants the development to be \n \nin the suburbs.

(There\nis, of course, no hint of anything like this defense in the \ntext of the FHA.  But then, there is no hint of disparate-\nimpact liability in the text of the FHA either.)\n  The effect of these regulations, not surprisingly, is to \nconfer  enormous  discretion  on  HUD—without  actually \nsolving the problem.  What is a “substantial” interest?  Is \nthere a difference between a “legitimate” interest and a \n“nondiscriminatory” interest?  To what degree must an \ninterest be met for a practice to be “necessary”?   How are \nparties and courts to measure “discriminatory effect”? \n  These questions are not answered by the Court’s assur-\nance that the FHA’s disparate-impact “analysis ‘is analo-\ngous  to  the  Title  VII  requirement  that  an  employer’s \ninterest in an employment practice with a disparate im-\npact be job related.’”  Ante, at 4 (quoting 78 Fed. Reg. \n \n11470).  See also ante, at 18 (likening the defense to “the \nbusiness  necessity  standard”).    The  business-necessity \ndefense is complicated enough in employment cases; what \nit means when plopped into the housing context is any-\nbody’s guess.  What is the FHA analogue of “job related”?  \nIs it “housing related”?  But a vast array of municipal \ndecisions affect property values and thus relate (at least \nindirectly) to housing.  And what  is the FHA analogue of \n“business necessity”?  “Housing-policy necessity”?  What \ndoes that mean? \n  Compounding  the  problem,  the  Court  proclaims  that \n“governmental  entities  . . .  must  not  be  prevented  from \nachieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compli-\nance with health and safety codes.”  Ante, at 21.  But what  \ndoes the Court mean by a “legitimate” objective?  And does \nthe Court mean to say that there can be no disparate-\n\n32  TEXAS DEPT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS  v.   \n  INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC. \n\nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nimpact lawsuit if the objective is “legitimate”?  That is  \ncertainly not the view of the Government, which takes the \nposition that a disparate-impact claim may be brought to \nchallenge  actions  taken  with  such  worthy  objectives  as \nimproving  housing  in  poor  neighborhoods  and  making \nfinancially sound lending decisions.  See Brief for United \nStates as Amicus Curiae 30, n. 7. \n  Because HUD’s regulations and the Court’s pronounce-\nments are so “hazy,” Central Bank, 511 U. S., at 188–189,  \ncourts—lacking expertise in the field of housing policy—\nmay inadvertently harm the very people that the FHA is \nmeant to help.  Local governments make countless deci-\nsions  that  may  have  some  disparate  impact  related  to \nhousing.  See ante, at 19–20.  Certainly Congress did not\nintend to “engage the federal courts in an endless exercise \nof second-guessing” local programs.  Canton v. Harris, 489 \nU. S. 378, 392 (1989).\n  Even if a city or private entity named in a disparate-\nimpact suit believes that it is likely  to prevail if a disparate-\nimpact suit is fully litigated, the costs of litigation, in- \ncluding the expense of discovery and experts, may “push \ncost-conscious  defendants  to  settle  even  anemic  cases.”  \nBell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, 559 (2007).  \nDefendants may feel compelled to “abandon substantial \ndefenses and . . . pay settlements in order to avoid the \nexpense and risk of going to trial.”  Central Bank, supra, \nat  189.  And  parties  fearful  of  disparate-impact  claims \nmay let race drive their decisionmaking in hopes of avoid-\ning litigation altogether.  Cf. Ricci, 557 U. S., at 563.  All \nthe while, similar dynamics may drive litigation against \nprivate actors.  Ante, at 19. \n  This is not the Fair Housing Act that Congress enacted. \nVI \n  Against all of this, the Court offers several additional  \ncounterarguments.  None is persuasive. \n\n  Cite as:  576 U. S. ____ (2015)  33  \n \nALITO,  J., dissenting \n \nA \n\n  The Court is understandably worried about pretext.  No  \none thinks that those who harm others because of pro- \ntected characteristics should escape liability by conjuring \nup neutral excuses.  Disparate-treatment liability, however, \nis  attuned  to  this  difficulty.  Disparate  impact  can  be \nevidence of disparate treatment.  E.g.,  Church of Lukumi \nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 541–542 (1993) \n(opinion of KENNEDY,  J.); Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U. S. \n222, 233 (1985).  As noted, the facially neutral require-\nments in Griggs created a strong inference of discrimina-\ntory intent.  Nearly a half century later, federal judges \nhave decades of experience sniffing out pretext. \nB \n  The  Court  also  stresses  that  “many  of  our  Nation’s \nlargest  cities—entities  that  are  potential  defendants  in \ndisparate-impact suits—have submitted an amicus brief in \nthis case supporting disparate-impact liability under the \nFHA.”  Ante, at 23–24. \n  This nod to federalism is puzzling.  Only a minority of \nthe States and only a small fraction of the Nation’s munic-\nipalities  have  urged  us  to  hold  that  the  FHA  allows \ndisparate-impact suits.  And even if a majority supported \nthe Court’s position, that would not be a relevant consid-\neration for a court.  In  any event, nothing prevents States \nand local government from enacting their own fair housing \nlaws,  including  laws  creating  disparate-impact  liability.  \nSee 42 U. S. C. §3615 (recognizing local authority). \n  The Court also claims that “[t]he existence of disparate-\nimpact liability in the substantial majority of the Courts  of \nAppeals for the last several decades” has not created “‘dire \n \nconsequences.’”  Ante,  at 24.  But the Court concedes that \n \ndisparate impact can be dangerous.  See ante, at 18–22.  \nCompare  Magner,  619  F. 3d,  at  833–838  (holding  that \nefforts to prevent violations of the housing code may vio-\n\n34  TEXAS DEPT.

Tydings) (urging enactment of the FHA to help \ncombat violations of the housing code, including “rat prob-\nlem[s]”).  In the Court’s words, it is “paradoxical to con-\nstrue  the  FHA  to  impose  onerous  costs  on  actors  who \nencourage revitalizing dilapidated housing.”  Ante, at 19.   \nOur say-so, however, will not stop such costly cases from \nbeing filed—or from getting past a motion to dismiss (and \nso into settlement). \nC \n  At last I come to the “purpose” driving the Court’s anal-\nysis: The desire to eliminate the “vestiges” of “residential \nsegregation by race.”  Ante, at 5,  23.  We agree that all \nAmericans should be able “to buy decent houses without \ndiscrimination . . .  because of the color of their skin.”  114 \nCong.  Rec.  2533  (remarks  of  Sen.  Tydings)  (emphasis \nadded).  See 42 U. S. C. §§3604(a), 3605(a) (“because of \nrace”).  But this Court has no license to expand the scope \nof the FHA to beyond what Congress enacted. \n  When  interpreting  statutes,  “‘[w]hat  the  legislative \n \nintention  was,  can  be  derived  only  from  the  words  . . . \nused;  and  we  cannot  speculate  beyond  the  reasonable \nimport of these words.’”  Nassar, 570 U. S., at ___ (slip op., \n \nat 13) (quoting Gardner v. Collins, 2 Pet. 58, 93 (1829)).  \n“[I]t frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent \nsimplistically to assume that whatever furthers the stat-\nute’s primary objective must be the law.”  Rodriguez v.  \nUnited States, 480 U. S. 522, 526 (1987) (per curiam).  See \nalso, e.g.,  Board of Governors, FRS v. Dimension Financial \nCorp.,  474  U. S.  361,  373–374  (1986)  (explaining  that \n“‘broad purposes’” arguments “ignor[e] the complexity of \n   \nthe problems Congress is called upon to address”).\n  Here, privileging purpose over text also creates constitu-\ntional uncertainty.  The Court acknowledges the risk that \ndisparate impact may be used to “perpetuate race-based \n\n  Cite as:  576 U.

And it agrees that “racial quotas . . . rais[e] serious \nconstitutional concerns.”  Ante, at 20.  Yet it still reads the \nFHA  to  authorize  disparate-impact  claims.

Defendants Texas\nDepartment of Housing and Community Affairs and its Executive Director and board\nmembers in their official capacities (collectively, “TDHCA”) oppose the motion.  For the\nreasons that follow, the court awards ICP attorney’s fees in the sum of $1,869,577.00 and \nnontaxable costs in the sum of $24,392.00.\nI\nICP’s fee motion follows a bench trial in which ICP pursued claims that, in allocating\nLow Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”) in the Dallas metropolitan area, TDHCA \nintentionally discriminated based on race, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment (actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) and 42 U.S.C. § 1982, and that\nTDHCA’s allocation decisions had a disparate racial impact, in violation of §§ 3604(a) and\n\n3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”).1  The court ruled in favor of ICP on its disparate\nimpact claim under §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the FHA, and against ICP on its intentional\ndiscrimination claims under the Equal Protection Clause and § 1982.  See Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 860 F.Supp.2d 312, 313-14, 321 (N.D.\nTex. 2012).\nICP moves under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(C) and 42 U.S.C. § 3613(c)(2) for an award\nof attorney’s fees and nontaxable costs.  It has reduced its fee requests by 664 hours (a 12%\nreduction from the lodestar), which it maintains are related to the unsuccessful discriminatory\npurpose claim.  ICP has also reduced the hours claimed based on eliminating time spent on\nintervenor Frazier Revitalization Inc.’s amicus brief and motion to intervene, possible\nduplication of effort, and other billing judgment reductions.  TDHCA argues that the\nrequested fees should be reduced for three reasons: first, ICP had limited success in the\nlawsuit; second, certain billing entries are vague; and third, the hourly rates claimed by ICP’s\nattorneys are unreasonable.\nII\nWhen a plaintiff prevails on a claim under §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the FHA, “the\ncourt, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a\nreasonable attorney’s fee and costs.”  42 U.S.C. § 3613(c)(2).\nThe  determination  of  a  fees  award  is  a  two-step  process. \n1The court assumes the parties’ familiarity with its prior opinions in this case, and thus\nonly sets out the facts necessary to understand this memorandum opinion and order.  \n- 2 -\n\nRutherford v. Harris Cnty., 197 F.3d 173, 192 (5th Cir. 1999). \nFirst the court calculates the “lodestar” which is equal to the\nnumber  of  hours  reasonably  expended  multiplied  by  the\nprevailing hourly rate in the community for similar work.  Id. \nThe court should exclude all time that is excessive, duplicative,\nor inadequately documented.  Watkins v. Fordice, 7 F.3d 453,\n457 (5th Cir. 1993).  Once the lodestar amount is calculated, the\ncourt can adjust it based on the twelve factors set forth in\nJohnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-\n19 (5th Cir. 1974).2\nJimenez v. Wood Cnty., Tex., 621 F.3d 372, 379-80 (5th Cir. 2010).  The lodestar, however,\nis presumptively reasonable and adequate to induce attorneys to undertake representation in\nmeritorious civil rights cases.  See Perdue v. Kenny A., ___ U.S. ___, 130 S. Ct. 1662, 1672-\n73 (2010).  The applicant bears the burden of substantiating both the requested hours and the\nhourly rates.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983).\nIII\nTDHCA’s principal ground for opposing ICP’s fee application is that ICP achieved\nlimited success in this lawsuit by failing to prove intentional discrimination.  TDHCA\nmaintains that, as with the court’s decision to award ICP 50% of its taxable costs, the court\n2The factors are: (1) the time and labor required for the litigation; (2) the novelty and\ndifficulty of the questions presented; (3) the skill required to perform the legal services\nproperly; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the\ncase; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations\nimposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the result obtained;\n(9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys; (10) the “undesirability” of the\ncase; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12)\nawards in similar cases.  Johnson, 488 F.2d at 717-19.  The Supreme Court has “barred any\nuse” of the sixth factor.  Merrick v. Scott, 2011 WL 1938188, at *1 n.3 (N.D. Tex. May 20,\n2011) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (quoting Rutherford, 197 F.3d at 193).\n- 3 -\n\nshould award 50% of the fees reasonably incurred, and it contends that ICP’s 12% voluntary\nreduction is inadequate.\nA\nA plaintiff’s degree of success is the most critical Johnson factor for determining\nreasonableness of the fee award.  See, e.g., Barrow v. Greenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 2005 WL\n6789456, at *18 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 20, 2005) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (citing Farrar v. Hobby, 506\nU.S. 103, 114 (1992)), aff’d, 2007 WL 3085028 (5th Cir. Oct. 23, 2007).  Determining fee\nreasonableness based on the degree of success depends initially on whether the plaintiff’s\nclaims for relief were related.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434-45.  The court holds that ICP’s\nclaims of intentional discrimination and disparate impact involved a “common core of facts”\nand were based on “related legal theories.”3  The court therefore focuses next on “the\nsignificance of the overall relief obtained by [ICP] in relation to the hours reasonably\nexpended on the litigation.”  Id. at 435.  When a plaintiff obtains “excellent results, [its]\nattorney[s] should recover a fully compensatory fee.  Normally this will encompass all hours\nreasonably expended on the litigation[.]”  Id.  But where a plaintiff “achieve[s] only partial\nor limited success,” granting full compensation may be excessive, and the court may reduce\nthe attorney’s fees award to account for the limited success.  Id. at 436.\n3TDHCA does not contend that ICP’s claims for relief were unrelated.\n- 4 -\n\nB\nAs a threshold matter, the court rejects the premise that its decision to award ICP 50%\nof its taxable costs affects the attorney’s fees determination.  This is because different\nstandards apply.  For attorney’s fees, decisions like Hensley prescribe how the court, in its\ndiscretion, is to determine reasonableness.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435-36.  A different\nstandard regulates the court’s discretion in awarding taxable costs.  Cf. Copper Liquor, Inc.\nv. Adolph Coors Co., 684 F.2d 1087, 1101 (5th Cir. 1982) (“[W]e know of no authority for\na percentage reduction of either costs, properly defined, or expenses, recoverable as ‘cost of\nsuit,’ based on the factors used by the district court to reduce attorneys’ fees.”), overruled on\nother grounds by Int’l Woodworkers of Am. v. Champion Int’l Corp., 790 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir\n1986) (en banc); see Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 132 S. Ct. 1997, 2006 (2012)\n(holding that court’s discretion under Rule 54(d) “is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs,\nthe items enumerated in [28 U.S.C.] § 1920.” (quoting Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons,\nInc., 482 U.S. 437, 442 (1987))).  The court therefore declines to apply correspondingly its\ndecision on taxable costs to its award of attorney’s fees.\nC\nTDHCA  maintains  that  ICP  had  only  limited  success  because  its  intentional\ndiscrimination claim was unsuccessful.  But when a plaintiff obtains “excellent results”\ncompared to the relief sought, “the fee award should not be reduced simply because the\nplaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit.”  Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n435.  In cases seeking injunctive relief, courts consider the results “excellent” where the\n- 5 -\n\nplaintiff obtains “the bulk of the relief [it] sought.”  Smith v. Tarrant Cnty. Coll. Dist., 2010\nWL 4063226, at *6 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 13, 2010) (Means, J.) (holding that plaintiff obtained\n“excellent  results”  in  action  against  college’s  restrictions  on  political  activity,  where\n“Plaintiffs obtained the bulk of the relief they sought, including a court order enjoining TCC\nfrom prohibiting Plaintiffs’ protests on campus.  While the Court did not accept each and\nevery contention raised by Plaintiffs, the Court granted favorable relief to Plaintiffs based on\nthe claims in support of which these contentions were raised.”); see also Barrow, 2005 WL\n6789456, at *18 (holding that “[f]rom a non-monetary standpoint, [plaintiff] clearly obtained\nexcellent results” by establishing “that her constitutional right had been violated, that she had\nsustained actual damages as a result, and that [defendant] should be punished for his conduct\nthrough an award of punitive damages”).  Cf. Wesley v. Yellow Transp., Inc., 2010 WL\n4629972, at *5-6 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 2010) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (reducing attorney’s fees request\nby 50% where requested amount exceeded six times plaintiffs’ recovery, plaintiffs only\nprevailed on three (or fewer) of original twenty-four claims, and several plaintiffs represented\nby same attorneys were entirely unsuccessful).\nAlthough ICP failed to prove intentional discrimination, and the court did not adopt\nall of ICP’s objections to TDHCA’s proposed remedial plan, the ultimate results of ICP’s\nlawsuit were “excellent.”  ICP secured a remedy that addressed virtually every request in its\ncomplaint.4  The following examples are illustrative.  ICP sought injunctive relief requiring\n4Not only did ICP secure a remedy that addressed virtually every request in its\ncomplaint, TDHCA has not suggested that ICP could have obtained any additional relief if\n- 6 -\n\nTDHCA to allocate LIHTC so that more such developments are located in non-minority\ncensus tracts.  See Compl. 16.  The remedial plan adopts an “Opportunity Index” to provide\nmore incentives for LIHTC applicants to target “high opportunity areas” (“HOAs”).  See\nInclusive Cmtys. Project v. Tex. Dep’t of Housing & Cmty. Affairs, 2012 WL 3201401, at *4\n(N.D.  Tex.  Aug.  7,  2012)  (“ICP  IV”).    The  plan  institutes  a  tie-breaker  that  favors\ndevelopments in HOAs.  See id.  ICP’s complaint sought to enjoin TDHCA from approving\nLIHTC for areas with environmental concerns or high crime rates.  See Compl. 16-17.  The\nremedial plan “strengthen[s] the criteria for disqualifying proposed development sites that\nhave undesirable features” and requires that applicants obtain preclearance from TDHCA if\na proposed site “involves any negative site features . . . [at] or within 1000 feet of the\nproposed site.”5  ICP IV, 2012 WL 3201401, at *11.  The complaint also requested\nmonitoring requirements, which the remedial plan includes.  See Compl. 17; ICP IV, 2012\nWL 3201401, at *12.  Because ICP obtained an excellent degree of success, the court\nit had successfully proved intentional discrimination.  Instead, TDHCA simply relies on its\nmistaken interpretation of Hensley, contending that ICP achieved limited success because\nsome of its claims failed.  Contra Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435 (holding that when plaintiff\nobtains excellent results in lawsuit with related claims, “the court’s rejection of or failure to\nreach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee.  The result is what\nmatters.”). \n5Although the court in adopting the remedial plan did not accept all of ICP’s\nobjections, including its objection that the preclearance requirement’s bright-line distance\nrule is an inadequate measure of risk, the court need not have awarded ICP everything it\nrequested to consider the results obtained “excellent.”  See, e.g., Smith, 2010 WL 4063226,\nat *1, 6 (concluding that some of plaintiffs’ challenges to college’s rules were non-\njusticiable, but finding results “excellent” because plaintiffs “obtained the bulk of the relief\nthey sought”).\n- 7 -\n\ndeclines to reduce the amount based on the eighth Johnson factor beyond the 12% reduction\nthat ICP already voluntarily incorporated into its requested amount of attorney’s fees.6\nD\nTDHCA objects that ICP is attempting to recover fees for a disparate impact claim\nthat it did not plead, and that this warrants a reduction in the fee award.\nFirst, TDHCA does not maintain that ICP’s supposed failure to plead disparate impact\nis an independent ground for reducing the fee award.  It instead relies on this argument as\nevidence that ICP’s attorneys spent much of their time on the unsuccessful intentional\ndiscrimination claim.  See, e.g., Ds. Br. 6 (“Given that Plaintiff expressly pled this case only\nas a discriminatory ‘purpose’ suit, certainly most of the time spent in discovery related to the\npurposeful discrimination claim.” (citation omitted)).  But as the court has already explained,\nbecause ICP obtained excellent results, the court declines to further reduce the fee to account\nfor hours expended on the unsuccessful claims.\nSecond, the court rejects the premise that ICP is attempting to recover fees on an\nunpleaded claim.  The court recognized in an opinion filed almost one year before trial that\nICP had brought a discriminatory impact claim under the FHA.  See Inclusive Cmtys. Project,\nInc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 749 F.Supp.2d 486, 498 n.10 (N.D. Tex. 2010)\n(Fitzwater, C.J.) (“ICP II”) (“The court addresses only ICP’s discriminatory impact claim\nunder the FHA.”).  And regardless whether ICP had adequately alleged this claim in its\n6The court has considered the remaining Johnson factors and concludes that no further\nadjustment to the lodestar is warranted.\n- 8 -\n\ncomplaint, “[t]he joint pretrial order supersedes all pleadings and governs the issues and\nevidence to be presented at trial.”  E.E.O.C. v. Serv. Temps, Inc., 2010 WL 5108733, at *3\n(N.D. Tex. Dec. 9, 2010) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (citing Quick Techs., Inc. v. Sage Grp., PLC, 313\nF.3d 338, 345-46 n.5 (5th Cir. 2002)), aff’d, 679 F.3d 323 (5th Cir. 2012).  “‘Once the\n[pretrial] order is entered, it controls the scope and course of the trial.’”  Schadler v. Anthem\nLife Ins. Co., 147 F.3d 388, 392-93 n.4 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting Rule 16).  It is apparent from\nthe pretrial order that a disparate impact claim was at issue.  Not only are the terms “disparate\nimpact” and “discriminatory impact” used in the pretrial order, see PTO at 5, but the term\n“compelling governmental interest” is used as well, id. at 7-9.  And as is clear from the\ncourt’s ruling in ICP II, the burden of proving that TDHCA’s actions were in furtherance of\na compelling government interest relates directly to a disparate impact claim.  See ICP II, 749\nF.Supp.2d at 498 (“If ICP can establish a prima facie case in support of its FHA claim, the\nburden  shifts  to  defendants  to  prove  that  TDHCA’s  actions  furthered  a  compelling\ngovernment interest.”).\nIV\nTDHCA maintains that ICP’s attorneys’ billing records contain hundreds of hours of\nvague entries that should not be compensated or, alternatively, should result in a 10%\nreduction in the fees requested. \nA\nThe party seeking reimbursement of attorney’s fees meets its burden of establishing\nthe number of hours expended by “presenting evidence that is adequate for the court to\n- 9 -\n\ndetermine what hours should be included in the reimbursement.”  Bramlett v. Med. Protective\nCo. of Fort Wayne, Ind., 2010 WL 3294248, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 20, 2010) (Fitzwater,\nC.J.) (quoting Bode v. United States, 919 F.2d 1044, 1047 (5th Cir. 1990)).  “Exceptionally\nterse descriptions of activities do not constitute sufficient documentation.”  Id. (citing League\nof United Latin Am. Citizens No. 4552 (LULAC) v. Roscoe Indep. Sch. Dist., 119 F.3d 1228,\n1233 (5th Cir. 1997)) (disallowing fees for “research and review of cases” because entry was\nimpermissibly vague); see also Cookston v. Freeman, Inc., 1999 WL 714760, at *2 (N.D.\nTex. Sept. 14, 1999) (Fitzwater, J.) (collecting cases).  “Litigants take their chances when\nsubmitting such fee applications, as they provide little information from which to determine\nthe ‘reasonableness’ of the hours expended on tasks vaguely referred to as ‘pleadings,’\n‘documents,’ or ‘correspondence’ without stating what was done with greater precision.”  La.\nPower & Light Co. v. Kellstrom, 50 F.3d 319, 327 (5th Cir. 1995).  Billing entries must\nexplain the subject matter of the task enough to allow the court to determine whether the time\nwas reasonably expended.  See Fralick v. Plumbers & Pipefitters Nat’l Pension Fund, 2011\nWL 487754, at *7 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 11, 2011) (Fitzwater, C.J.).\nB\nTDHCA identifies the time entries it challenges in only one sentence in its brief:\n“Here, Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing records include hundreds of hours of vague entries, such\nas ‘preparation for trial,’ Doc. 203 at 108, ‘exhibit preparation,’ Doc. 203 at 97, and block\nbilling of ‘analysis, research, drafting’ for various pleadings, Doc. 203 at 94-95.”  Ds. Br. 9.\n- 10 -\n\n1\nThe time entries for “analysis, research, drafting,” in the context of this case, are\nneither impermissible block billing nor fatally vague.  \nThe term “block billing” refers to the disfavored “time-keeping method by which each\nlawyer and legal assistant enters the total daily time spent working on a case, rather than\nitemizing the time expended on specific tasks.”  Fralick, 2011 WL 487754, at *4 (citation\nomitted).  For example, a person engaging in block billing would record the total amount of\ntime spent on a case that day, and then group several tasks under that single entry, leaving\nthe court unable to determine how much time was devoted to a given task.  See id. at *5. \nICP’s billing entries for “analysis, research, drafting” are not block billing because these\ntasks are sufficiently intertwined to be treated as one task.  See P. App. 94; see also Fralick,\n2011 WL 487754, at *5 (holding that entries are not block-billed where “the task [has] a\none-to-one correspondence with the number of hours reported for that day,” such as\n“[attorney] expended 2.5 hours on 1/28/09 preparing exhibits to complaint and did nothing\nelse on this case”).\nNeither are the entries “analysis, research, drafting” vague.  Each entry of “analysis,\nresearch, drafting” describes the subject matter of the task, such as “analysis, research,\ndrafting response to [TDHCA] brief” or “analysis, research and drafting reply brief.”  P. App.\n94.  Including the subject matter of the task provides an explanation so that the court can\ndetermine whether the time was reasonably expended.  See Fralick, 2011 WL 487754, at *7\n(comparing insufficient entry “Tel. confs. with DJones” with sufficient entry “Tel. conf. with\n- 11 -\n\nRHopp re joint status report”).  The court declines to reduce any of the fees for billing entries\ndesignated as “analysis, research, drafting.”\n2\nThe billing entries for “exhibit preparation” are not vague because they offer some\ndescription of the subject matter and thus enable the court to determine whether the time was\nreasonably expended.  The entries for “exhibit preparation” include a basic description of the\nexhibits, such as “exhibit preparation of new exhibits including exhibits to support remedy\nrequested,” “exhibit preparation of new exhibits,” and “exhibit preparation and drafting\nexhibit list with complete names.”  P. App. 97.  These entries are sufficient for the court to\ndetermine whether the time expended was reasonable.\n3\nThe billing entries for “preparation for trial,” however, are vague.  Although these\nentries only appear on the days of trial, the court cannot determine what tasks ICP maintains\nwere entailed in “preparation for trial,” or whether the time expended was reasonable.  See\nP. App. 108.  Therefore, a reduction in the hours is warranted.  \nWhen the court determines that billing entries are vague, it can reduce the allowed\ntime for the entries.  See Fralick, 2011 WL 487754, at *7 (applying 10% reduction to vague\nentries).  ICP’s attorneys’ records describe 14 hours expended by Laura B. Beshara, Esquire\n(“Beshara”) as having been expended in “preparation for trial.”  Applying a 10% reduction\nand multiplying the reduced time by the hourly rate of $350 (which the court finds below is\n- 12 -\n\nreasonable), the court subtracts $490 from the fee award (1.4 hours x $350 = $490).7\nV\nThe court next considers whether the requested hourly rates for ICP’s attorneys are\nreasonable.\nA\n“The hourly rates to be used in the lodestar calculation are determined by ‘the\nprevailing market rates in the relevant community.’”  Barrow, 2005 WL 6789456, at *15\n(quoting Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984)).  As the fee applicant, ICP “bears the\nburden of demonstrating ‘that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the\ncommunity for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and\nreputation.’”  Id. (quoting Blum, 465 U.S. at 895 n.11).\n7Although there are similar examples to “preparation for trial” that can be found in the\nattorneys’ time records, see, e.g., P. App. 90 (“prepare for pretrial conference”), TDHCA\ndoes not challenge them in its one-sentence assertion.  See Ds. Br. 9.  If a party does not\nobject to particular billing entries as inadequately documented, the court is not obliged sua\nsponte to sift through fee records searching for vague entries or block-billing.  See generally\nKellstrom, 50 F.3d at 325 (holding that district court erred in failing to conduct full analysis\nof billing records “[a]s to the specific items of which [opposing party] complains”).  It is a\ncommon practice for courts to address only those potentially inadequate entries brought to\nthe court’s attention.  See, e.g., Barrow, 2005 WL 6789456, at *12 (“examining the\nindividual entries to which [the opposing party] objects”); Great Am. Ins. Co. v. AFS/IBEX\nFin. Servs., Inc., 2009 WL 361956, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 13, 2009) (O’Connor, J.)\n(analyzing “specific entries identified by [opposing party]”), vacated on other grounds, 612\nF.3d 800 (5th Cir. 2010); Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. v. Veigel Farm Partners, 2008 WL\n3992060, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 20, 2008) (Robinson, J.) (“Defendants refer to only 7 billing\nentries that they contend are ‘vague.’  Of those entries referenced by the Defendants, the\nCourt finds that the following billing entries are too vague[.]”).\n- 13 -\n\nB  \nICP requests $400 per hour for Michael M. Daniel, Esquire (“Daniel”) and $350 per\nhour for Beshara.  As support for these rates, ICP relies on Daniel’s declaration detailing his\nand Beshara’s qualifications and experience.  Both have been civil rights attorneys since they\ngraduated law school: Daniel in 1974 and Beshara in 1991.  Daniel’s declaration lists\nnumerous civil rights cases that they have litigated, including many concerning housing\nissues.  Based on these qualifications and experience, Daniel avers that the requested rates\nare reasonable.  And to show that the requested rates are within the appropriate range, ICP\nrelies on cases from judges of this court addressing the reasonable rates paid to attorneys with\nsimilar qualifications and experience.  See, e.g., Black v. SettlePou, P.C., 2012 WL 3638681,\nat *4 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 24, 2012) (Kinkeade, J.) (finding reasonable, in employment case,\nrates of $450 per hour for 10-year attorney and $375 per hour for 7-year attorney); Nassar\nv. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr., 2010 WL 3000877, at *5 (N.D. Tex. July 27, 2010) (Boyle,\nJ.) (accepting as reasonable, in employment case, rates of $400 per hour for 12-year attorney,\n$500 per hour for 11-year attorney, and $750 per hour for 27-year attorney), aff’d in part,\nrev’d in part, 674 F.3d 448 (5th Cir. 2012), cert. granted, 2013 WL 203552 (U.S. Jan. 18,\n2013) (No. 12-484); see also P. App. 122-30 (listing attorneys’ years of practice).\nTDHCA requests that the court decrease the requested rates by $50 each.  It objects\nthat ICP has failed to submit affidavits from other attorneys practicing in the community, and\nthat the examples of attorney’s fees on which ICP relies are from unrelated cases.  The court\nconcludes that ICP has satisfied its burden “to produce satisfactory evidence, in addition to\n- 14 -\n\n[its] attorney’s affidavit, that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the\nrelevant  community  for  similar  services  by  lawyers  of  reasonably  comparable  skill,\nexperience and reputation.”  Wheeler v. Mental Health & Mental Retardation Auth. of Harris\nCnty., Tex., 752 F.2d 1063, 1073 (5th Cir. 1985) (citing Blum, 465 U.S. at 895 n.11).  Similar\nto the plaintiff in Wheeler, ICP submitted its attorney’s declaration and directed the court’s\nattention to fee awards in the relevant district court.  Compare id. (“Wheeler submitted the\naffidavit of her attorney . . . .  Wheeler further directed the court’s attention to fee awards in\nthe Southern District of Texas based upon hourly rates in line with those requested by her\nattorney.”) with Estrada v. City of El Paso, Tex., 500 F.Supp.2d 677, 679 (W.D. Tex. 2006)\n(adopting rate proposed by defendant because plaintiff “ha[d] not submitted any evidence\nother than her own counsel’s declaration”).\nTDHCA also objects that the requested rates exceed the average and median rates for\nattorneys with similar years of experience in the Dallas area, according to the 2009 survey\ncompiled by the State Bar of Texas.  See Ds. Br. Exh. 1 at 11 (listing median rate as $286 per\nhour for Dallas attorney with over 25 years experience, and $287 per hour for one with 21\nto 25 years experience).  Although ICP’s requested rates exceed the median for attorneys in\nthe Dallas area, “[h]ere, rather than dealing with the ‘median,’ we have two attorneys with\nsignificant experience and ability.”  Williams v. City of Balch Springs, Tex., 1999 WL\n1146802, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 17, 1999) (Solis, J.).  Both Daniel and Beshara have\nextensive experience in civil rights litigation, including many cases concerning housing\ndiscrimination.  Moreover, “trial courts are considered experts as to the reasonableness of\n- 15 -\n\nattorney’s fees[.]”  Primrose Operating Co. v. Nat’l Am. Ins. Co., 382 F.3d 546, 562 (5th Cir.\n2004); Wachovia Bank, Nat’l Ass’n v. Schlegel, 2010 WL 4275277, at *2 n.4 (N.D. Tex. Oct.\n29, 2010) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (same).  The court finds, based on its expertise in determining\nreasonable attorney’s fees, that the hourly rates claimed for Daniel and Beshara are well\nwithin what is reasonable for attorneys of their experience and expertise.\nTDHCA’s arguments and evidence are insufficient to undermine the reasonableness\nof the requested rates for Daniel and Beshara. \nVI\nICP moves for an award of $24,392.00 in nontaxable costs, which TDHCA does not\ncontest.  These costs consist of $14,442.00 in fees and expenses that ICP paid to its expert\nwitnesses whom TDHCA deposed, and $9,950 representing 50% of the fees and expenses\nincurred in obtaining the experts’ initial opinions.  TDHCA does not challenge either of these\nrequests, and the court grants ICP’s motion in this respect.\n*     *     *\nAccordingly, the court grants plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees and nontaxable\ncosts in the amount of $1,869,577.00 in attorney’s fees and $24,392.00 in nontaxable costs. \nSO ORDERED.\nFebruary 15, 2013.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

GRAVES, JR., Circuit Judge: \nIn this housing discrimination case, the district court held that plaintiff \nThe  Inclusive  Communities  Project  (“ICP”)  had  proven  that  Defendants’ \nallocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”) in Dallas resulted in \na disparate impact on African-American residents under the Fair Housing Act \n(“FHA”).  The primary issue on appeal is the correct legal standard to be \napplied in disparate impact claims under the FHA.  We adopt the standard \nannounced  in  recently  enacted  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”) regulations regarding the burdens of proof in disparate \nimpact housing discrimination cases, see 24 C.F.R. § 100.500, and remand to \nthe district court for application of this standard in the first instance. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background \nICP  filed  this  action  against  Defendants  the  Texas  Department  of \nHousing and Community Affairs (“TDHCA”) and its Executive Director and \nboard members in their official capacities under the FHA, the Fourteenth \nAmendment, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983.  “ICP is a non-profit organization \nthat seeks racial and socioeconomic integration in the Dallas metropolitan \narea. In particular, ICP assists low-income, predominately African-American \nfamilies who are eligible for the Dallas Housing Authority’s Section 8 Housing \nChoice  Voucher  program  (‘Section  8’)  in  finding  affordable  housing  in \npredominately Caucasian, suburban neighborhoods.” Inclusive Communities \nProject, Inc. v. Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs (ICP II), 860 F. Supp. 2d \n312,  314  (N.D.  Tex.  2012)  (order  after  bench  trial)  (footnote  omitted).    A \n2 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 3     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 3 of 16   PageID 8643\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \ndevelopment that receives tax credits under the LIHTC program cannot refuse \ntenants because of their use of Section 8 vouchers; thus “it is important to ICP \nwhere the developments are located in the Dallas metropolitan area.” Id. \nUnder  §  42  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  the  federal  government \nprovides  LIHTC  that  are  distributed  to  developers  of  low-income  housing \nthrough a designated state agency. See generally 26 U.S.C. § 42.  TDHCA \nadministers  the  federal  LIHTC  program  in  Texas.  See  Tex.  Gov’t  Code \n§ 2306.6701 et seq.  Developers apply to TDHCA for tax credits for particular \nhousing projects.  Such credits may be sold to finance construction of the \nproject.  ICP II, 860 F. Supp. 2d at 314.  The number of credits TDHCA may \naward  for  a  low-income  housing  project  is  determined  by  calculating  the \nproject’s “qualified basis,” which is a fraction representing the percentage of \nthe project occupied by low-income residents multiplied by eligible costs. See \n26 U.S.C. § 42(c). \nThere are two types of credits: 9% credits and 4% credits.  The 9% credits \nare distributed on an annual cycle and are oversubscribed, and developers \nmust compete with each other to earn the available credits.  As the district \ncourt explained:  \nCertain federal and state laws dictate, at least in part, the manner \nin which TDHCA can select the applications that will receive 9% \ntax credits.  First, I.R.C. § 42 requires that the designated state \nagency adopt a  “Qualified Allocation Plan” (“QAP”) that prescribes \nthe “selection criteria.” See id. at § 42(m)(1)(A)-(B).  The QAP must \ninclude,  inter  alia,  certain  selection  criteria,  see  id.  at  § \n42(m)(1)(C), and preferences, see id. at § 42(m)(1)(B); otherwise, \n“zero”  housing  credit  dollars  will  be  provided,  see  id.  at  § \n42(m)(1)(A).  Second, the Texas Government Code regulates how \nTDHCA  administers  the  LIHTC  program.    The  Code  requires \nTDHCA to adopt annually a QAP and corresponding manual. Id. \nat  §  2306.67022.    It  also  sets  out  how  TDHCA  is  to  evaluate \napplications.  TDHCA  must  first  “determine  whether  the \napplication satisfies the threshold criteria” in the QAP. Id. at § \n3 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 4     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 4 of 16   PageID 8644\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \n2306.6710(a).  Applications that meet the threshold criteria are \nthen “score[d] and rank[ed]” by “a point system” that “prioritizes \nin  descending  order”  ten  listed  statutory  criteria  (also  called \n“above-the-line  criteria”),  which  directly  affects  TDHCA’s \ndiscretion in creating the “selection criteria” in each QAP. Id. at § \n2306.6710(b).  The Texas Attorney General has interpreted this \nprovision to obligate TDHCA to “use a point system that prioritizes \nthe [statutory] criteria in that specific order.” Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. \nNo. GA-0208, 2004 WL 1434796, at *4 (2004). Although the Texas \nGovernment Code does not mandate the points to be accorded each \nstatutory  criterion,  “the  statute  must  be  construed  to  require \n[TDHCA] to assign more points to the first criterion than to the \nsecond, and so on, in order to effectuate the mandate that the \nscoring system ‘prioritiz[e the criteria] in descending order.’” Id. \n(quoting Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6710(b)(1) (West 2004)).  And \nwhile TDHCA can consider other criteria and preferences (also \ncalled “below-the-line” criteria), it “lacks discretionary authority to \nintersperse other factors into the ranking system that will have \ngreater points than” the statutory criteria. Id. at *6 (citation and \ninternal  quotation  omitted).  Once  TDHCA  adopts  a  QAP,  it \nsubmits the plan to the Governor, who can “approve, reject, or \nmodify and approve” it. Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6724(b)-(c) \n(West 2001).  Once approved, TDHCA staff review the applications \nin accordance with the QAP, underwrite applications in order “to \ndetermine  the  financial  feasibility  of  the  development  and  an \nappropriate level of housing tax credits,” id. at § 2306.6710(b)(1)(A) \n& (d), and submit their recommendations to TDHCA. See id. at § \n2306.6724(e).  TDHCA then reviews the staff recommendations \nand issues final commitments in accordance with the QAP. See id. \nat § 2306.6724(e)-(f). \nICP II, 860 F. Supp. 2d at 314-16 (footnotes omitted).  The parties heavily \ndispute the amount of discretion TDHCA has to award 9% credits to projects \nother than those receiving the highest scores.  By contrast, all agree that the \n4%  credits  are  allocated  on  a  non-competitive  basis  year-round  to \ndevelopments that use private activity bonds as a component of their project \nfinancing, some of which are issued by TDHCA.  Applicants need to meet only \ncertain threshold eligibility and underwriting requirements in order to receive \n4 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 5     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 5 of 16   PageID 8645\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \n4% tax credits.  Applications for the 4% tax credits are not subject to scoring \nunder the QAP selection criteria. See id. at 316. \nIn March 2008, ICP filed suit against Defendants, claiming that the \ndistribution of LIHTC in Dallas violated 42 U.S.C. §§ 1982 and 1983, the \nFourteenth Amendment, and the FHA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604 and 3605.  The FHA \nmakes it unlawful, inter alia, to “make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any \nperson because of race. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  Section 3605(a) provides that \nit  is  unlawful,  inter  alia,  “for  any  person  or  other  entity  whose  business \nincludes  engaging  in  residential  real  estate-related  transactions  to \ndiscriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in \nthe terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race. . . .”  Id. § 3605(a).  \nA  “residential  real  estate-related  transaction”  includes  providing  financial \nassistance for the construction of a dwelling. Id. § 3605(b).  ICP alleged that \nDefendants were disproportionately approving tax credit units in minority-\nconcentrated neighborhoods and disproportionately disapproving tax credit \nunits  in  predominantly  Caucasian  neighborhoods,  thereby  creating  a \nconcentration of the units in minority areas, a lack of units in other areas, and \nmaintaining and perpetuating segregated housing patterns.  \nICP filed a motion for partial summary judgment to establish standing \nand  a  prima  facie  case  of  discrimination.    Defendants  filed  motions  for \njudgment on the pleadings and summary judgment.  Defendants argued that, \nassuming that ICP had established a prima facie case, Defendants won as a \nmatter of law, under both disparate treatment and disparate impact theories \nof discrimination.1  The district court denied Defendants’ motions and granted \n                                         \n1 On appeal, Defendants now attempt to raise multiple challenges to the prima facie \ncase of disparate impact, including various challenges to ICP’s statistics and an argument \nthat ICP failed to isolate a specific policy or practice that caused the disparate impact.  Our \nown review of the record does not clearly resolve which of these challenges to the prima facie \ncase of disparate impact were waived in the district court.  Because we reverse and remand \n5 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 6     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 6 of 16   PageID 8646\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nICP partial summary judgment, concluding that ICP had made a prima facie \nshowing of both intentional discrimination and disparate impact. Inclusive \nCommunities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs (ICP I), 749 \nF. Supp. 2d 486, 499-500, 501-02 (N.D. Tex. 2010) (order granting partial \nsummary judgment).  With regard to the disparate impact case, the court \nconcluded that “ICP has established that its clients are African-Americans, \nmembers of a protected class, who rely on government assistance with housing, \nand that TDHCA has disproportionately approved tax credits for non-elderly \ndevelopments  in  minority  neighborhoods  and,  conversely,  has \ndisproportionately denied tax credits for non-elderly housing in predominately \nCaucasian  neighborhoods.”  Id.  at  499.    In  particular,  the  court  relied  on \nevidence that, “from 1999-2008, TDHCA approved tax credits for 49.7% of \nproposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Caucasian areas, but only approved \n37.4% of proposed nonelderly units in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas.” Id.  The \ncourt also pointed to data showing “92.29% of LIHTC units in the city of Dallas \nwere located in census tracts with less than 50% Caucasian residents.”  Id.  \nThe court found that the statistical evidence was supported by other evidence, \nincluding the “Talton Report,” a report of the House Committee on Urban \nAffairs and prepared for the Texas House of Representatives, which concluded \nthat  TDHCA  disproportionately  allocates  LIHTC  funds  to  developments \nlocated in areas with above-average minority concentrations. Id. at 500.  The \ncourt also relied on a HUD study reaching “a similar conclusion.” Id.  The \ndistrict  court  held  that  “[t]his  evidence  establishes  that  TDHCA \ndisproportionately  approves  applications  for  non-elderly  LIHTC  units  in \nminority neighborhoods, leading to a concentration of such units in these areas. \n                                         \nfor other reasons, we do not address the issue of whether the district court erred by holding \nthat ICP had established a prima facie case. \n6 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 7     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 7 of 16   PageID 8647\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nThis concentration increases the burden on ICP as it seeks to place African-\nAmerican Section 8 clients in LIHTC housing in predominately Caucasian \nneighborhoods.” Id. \nThe case then proceeded to trial on the remaining elements of ICP’s \nintentional discrimination and disparate impact claims.  After a bench trial on \nthe  merits,  the  district  court  found  that  ICP  did  not  meet  its  burden  of \nestablishing intentional discrimination and therefore found for the Defendants \non ICP’s § 1982, § 1983, and Fourteenth Amendment claims. ICP II, 860 F. \nSupp. 2d at 318-21.  On the disparate impact claim under the FHA, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 3604(a) and 3605(a), the district court applied the burdens of proof found in \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  decision  in  Huntington  Branch,  which  required \nDefendants to (1) justify their actions with a compelling governmental interest \nand (2) prove that there were no less discriminatory alternatives.  See id. at \n322-23 (citing Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d \n926, 939 (2d Cir. 1988), aff’d, 488 U.S. 15 (1988) (per curiam)).2  The district \ncourt assumed that Defendants’ interests were legitimate and bona fide, but \nconcluded that Defendants had not produced any evidence supporting their \ncontention  that  there  were  no  less  discriminatory  alternatives  to  the \nchallenged allocations.  Id. at 326.  The court concluded that Defendants had \nnot shown “that TDHCA cannot allocate LIHTC in a manner that is objective, \npredictable, and transparent, follows federal and state law, and furthers the \npublic interest, without disproportionately approving LIHTC in predominantly \nminority  neighborhoods  and  disproportionately  denying  LIHTC  in \npredominantly Caucasian neighborhoods.” Id.  For example, the court noted \nthat Defendants did not prove that “TDHCA cannot add other below-the-line \n                                         \n2 The Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit in Huntington Branch, but expressly \ndid not rule on the proper test for disparate impact housing discrimination claims in its \nopinion. Town of Huntington, N.Y. v. Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P., 488 U.S. 15, 18 (1988). \n7 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 8     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 8 of 16   PageID 8648\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \ncriteria [to the QAP] that will effectively reduce the discriminatory impact \nwhile still furthering its interests.” Id. at 327.  “Moreover,” the court found, \n“although  defendants  maintain  that  TDHCA’s  discretion  in  creating  the \nselection criteria is limited to adopting below-the-line criteria, it appears that \nthis discretion is actually broader.  It appears to extend to the authority to \nchoose the number of points to be accorded each above- and below-the-line \ncriterion,  so  long  as  the  priority  of  statutory  above-the-line  criteria  is \nmaintained and the Governor approves.” Id. at 328.  Because it held that \nDefendants had not met their burden of proof, the district court found in favor \nof ICP on its discriminatory impact claim under the FHA. Id. at 331.   \nAfter trial, while the district court was considering the injunctive remedy \nthat should be implemented, Frazier Revitalization, Inc. (“FRI”) was granted \npermission  to  intervene  to  represent  the  interests  of  developers  or \norganizations  who  seek  to  revitalize  low-income  neighborhoods.    After \nconsidering submissions from the parties, the district court adopted a remedial \nplan including alterations to the QAP, stated that it would review the plan \nannually  for  at  least  five  years,  and  entered  judgment.  See  Inclusive \nCommunities Project, Inc. v. Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, No 3:08-CV-\n0546-D, 2012 WL 3201401 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 7, 2012), amended in part, 2012 WL \n5458208 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 2012).  The court also ordered Defendants to pay \nattorneys’ fees to ICP. 3 \nII.  Discussion \nDefendants, along with Intervenor FRI, appeal various issues.  However, \nwe find it necessary to reach only one issue: whether the district court correctly \n                                         \n3 The consolidated appeal, No. 13-10306, challenges the attorneys’ fees the district \ncourt awarded to ICP.  In light of our remand, we likewise vacate and remand the award of \nattorneys’ fees in that appeal. \n8 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 9     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 9 of 16   PageID 8649\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nfound that ICP proved a claim of violation of the Fair Housing Act based on \ndisparate impact.   \nAs the district court correctly noted, violation of the FHA can be shown \neither by proof of intentional discrimination or by proof of disparate impact.  \nSee Artisan/Am. Corp. v. City of Alvin, Tex., 588 F.3d 291, 295 (5th Cir. 2009) \n(“We have recognized that a claim brought under the Act ‘may be established \nnot only by proof of discriminatory intent, but also by proof of a significant \ndiscriminatory effect.’”); Simms v. First Gibraltar Bank, 83 F.3d 1546, 1555 \n(5th Cir. 1996) (“We agree that a violation of the FHA may be established not \nonly by proof of discriminatory intent, but also by a showing of significant \ndiscriminatory effect.”).4  However, we have not previously determined the \nlegal  standards  that  should  be  applied  in  disparate  impact  housing \ndiscrimination cases.  \n                                         \n4 Defendants and FRI point to two recent cases in which the Supreme Court granted \ncertiorari to determine whether disparate impacts claims are cognizable under the FHA. See \nTwp. of Mount Holly, N.J. v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2824 (2013); \nMagner v. Gallagher, 132 S. Ct. 548 (2011).  Both cases were dismissed before the Court \nheard any argument.  Twp. of Mount Holly, N.J. v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., \n134 S. Ct. 636 (2013); Magner v. Gallagher, 132 S. Ct. 1306 (2012).  “Absent an intervening \nSupreme Court case overruling prior precedent, we remain bound to follow our precedent \neven  when  the  Supreme  Court  grants  certiorari on  an  issue.” United  States  v.

ICP II, 860 F. Supp. 2d at 322 (citing Huntington \nBranch, 844 F.2d at 939).  The district court noted the absence of controlling \nlaw, as this court has not previously addressed the question of what legal \nstandards apply to a disparate impact housing discrimination claim.  Our \nsister circuits have applied multiple different legal standards to similar claims \nunder the FHA.  See Robert G. Schwemm, Housing Discrimination Law and \nLitigation § 10:6 (2013) (discussing the various standards applied across the \ncircuits).  Most circuits agree that once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie \ncase, the burden shifts to the defendants to show that the challenged practice \nserves a legitimate interest. See Mt. Holly Gardens, 658 F.3d at 382; Gallagher, \n619 F.3d at 833-34; Graoch Assocs., 508 F.3d at 374; Mountain Side Mobile \nEstates, 56 F.3d at 1254; Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 936.  At that point, \nthe circuits diverge in some respects.  The Second and Third Circuits require a \ndefendant to bear the burden of proving that there are no less discriminatory \nalternatives to a practice that results in a disparate impact. See Huntington \nBranch,  844  F.2d  at  936;  Mt.  Holly  Gardens,  658  F.3d  at  382  (requiring \ndefendant to prove there is no less discriminatory alternative and plaintiff to \nprove  there  is  a  less  discriminatory  alternative).    The  Eighth  and  Tenth \nCircuits  place  the  burden  on  the  plaintiff  to  prove  that  there  are  less \ndiscriminatory alternatives. See Gallagher, 619 F.3d at 834; Mountain Side \nMobile Estates, 56 F.3d at 1254.  The Seventh Circuit has applied a four-factor \nbalancing test rather than burden-shifting. See Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 558 \nF.2d  at  1290.    The  Fourth  and  Sixth  Circuits  have  applied  a  four-factor \nbalancing test to public defendants and a burden-shifting approach to private \ndefendants. See Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs., 736 F.2d 983, 988 n.5 (4th Cir. \n1984); Graoch Assocs., 508 F.3d at 371, 372-74. \n10 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 11 of 16   PageID 8651\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nHowever, after the district court’s decision in this case, HUD issued \nregulations regarding disparate impact claims under the FHA.  See 24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.500; Implementation of the Fair Housing Act’s Discriminatory Effects \nStandard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11,460 (Feb. 15, 2013).  Congress has given HUD \nauthority to  administer the FHA, including authority to  issue regulations \ninterpreting the Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 3608(a), 3614a.  Specifically, 42 U.S.C. § \n3608(a)  gives  the  Secretary  of  HUD  the  “authority  and  responsibility  for \nadministering this Act,” and § 3614a provides expressly that “The Secretary \nmay make rules. . . to carry out this subchapter.”  The new regulations issued \nby HUD took effect in March 2013.  24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  The regulations \nrecognize,  as  we  have,  that  “Liability  may  be  established  under  the  Fair \nHousing  Act  based  on  a  practice’s  discriminatory  effect,  as  defined  in \nparagraph (a) of this section, even if the practice was not motivated by a \ndiscriminatory intent.” 24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  The regulations further provide \nthat “A practice has a discriminatory effect where it actually or predictably \nresults in a disparate impact on a group of persons or creates, increases, \nreinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race, color, \nreligion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.” Id. § 100.500(a).  \nFinally,  with  regard  to  the  burdens  of  proof  in  disparate  impact  housing \ndiscrimination cases, the regulations provide:  \n(1)  The charging party . . . has the burden of proving that a \nchallenged  practice  caused  or  predictably  will  cause  a \ndiscriminatory effect. \n(2)  Once the charging party or plaintiff satisfies the burden of \nproof  set  forth  in  paragraph  (c)(1)  of  this  section,  the \nrespondent or defendant has the burden of proving that the \nchallenged  practice  is  necessary  to  achieve  one  or  more \nsubstantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the \nrespondent or defendant. \n11 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 12     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 12 of 16   PageID 8652\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \n(3)  If the respondent or defendant satisfies the burden of proof \nset forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the charging \nparty or plaintiff may still prevail upon proving that the \nsubstantial,  legitimate,  nondiscriminatory  interests \nsupporting  the  challenged  practice  could  be  served  by \nanother practice that has a less discriminatory effect. \n24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c).  \nWe now adopt the burden-shifting approach found in 24 C.F.R. § 100.500 \nfor claims of disparate impact under the FHA. See 24 C.F.R. § 100.500.  First, \na plaintiff must prove a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that a \nchallenged practice causes a discriminatory effect, as defined by 24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.500(a).  24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(1).  If the plaintiff makes a prima facie \ncase, the defendant must then prove “that the challenged practice is necessary \nto achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests . . \n. .” Id. § 100.500(c)(2).  If the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff must \nthen show that the defendant’s interests “could be served by another practice \nthat has a less discriminatory effect.” Id. § 100.500(c)(3). \nThese standards are in accordance with disparate impact principles and \nprecedent.  While the approaches of our sister circuits have varied, the most \nrecent decisions have applied a similar three-step burden-shifting approach. \nMt.  Holly  Gardens,  658  F.3d  at  382;  Gallagher,  619  F.3d  at  834;  Graoch \nAssocs.,  508  F.3d  at  374.    Further,  the  three-step  burden-shifting  test \ncontained in the HUD regulations is similar to settled precedent concerning \nTitle VII disparate impact claims in employment discrimination cases.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k); Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 624 (2009) (describing \nthe disparate impact burdens of proof in Title VII employment discrimination \ncases).  Many courts interpreting the FHA recognize the similar purpose and \nlanguage of the statutes and borrow from Title VII precedent to interpret the \nFHA.  See, e.g., Graoch Assocs., 508 F.3d at 371-73; Kyles v. J.K. Guardian Sec. \n12 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 13     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 13 of 16   PageID 8653\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nServs., Inc., 222 F.3d 289, 295 (7th Cir. 2000) (“Courts have recognized that \nTitle VIII is the functional equivalent of Title VII and so the provisions of these \ntwo statutes are given like construction and application.”) (internal citations \nomitted)); Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 934-35.   \nGiven the complex record and fact-intensive nature of this case, and the \ndistrict court’s demonstrated expertise with those facts, we remand for the \ndistrict court to apply this legal standard to the facts in the first instance.  To \nbe clear, we do not hold that the district court must retry the case; we leave it \nto  the  sound  discretion  of  that  court  to  decide  whether  any  additional \nproceedings  are  necessary  or  appropriate.    Finally,  given  our  decision  to \nremand, we do not find it necessary to reach the additional arguments raised \nby Defendants in support of reversal.  \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons we have stated, we REVERSE and REMAND for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n13 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 14     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 14 of 16   PageID 8654\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \nJONES, Circuit Judge, specially concurring.\nAs a second-best result, I concur in the court’s judgment to reverse and \nremand this case for reconsideration under the recently promulgated HUD \nguidelines.  This is second-best, however, because on remand, the district court \nshould reconsider the State’s forceful argument that the appellees did not \nprove  a  facially  neutral  practice  that  caused  the  observed  disparity  in \nTDHCA’s allocation of LIHTC units to predominately “non-Caucasian” areas.  \nPerhaps the standard for proving a prima facie case of disparate impact in the \nfair housing context was uncertain before the HUD guidelines resolved circuit \nsplits.  In any event, because FHA cases will now be modeled closely upon the \nTitle VII formula, it is clear that the appellees could not rely on statistical \nevidence of disparity alone for their prima facie case.  See Smith v. City of \nJackson, 544 U.S. 228, 241, 125 S. Ct. 1536, 1545 (2005) (“[I]t is not enough to \nsimply allege that there is a disparate impact on workers.”); Pacheco v. Mineta, \n448 F.3d 783, 787 n.5 (5th Cir. 2003) (finding “Pacheco’s disparate impact \nallegations . . . wholly conclusional” because “[t]here is no suggestion of in what \nmanner the process operated so as to disadvantage Hispanics”); Simms v. First \nGibraltar Bank, 83 F.3d 1546, 1555 (5th Cir. 1996) (Fair Housing Act issue is \n“whether a policy, procedure, or practice specifically identified by the plaintiff \nhas a significantly greater discriminatory impact on members of a protected \nclass.”)  A plaintiff must specifically identify the facially neutral policy that \ncaused the disparity. \nThe appellees’ entire argument for disparate impact here assumed the \nconclusion:  there is a statistical “imbalance” in the location of LIHTC units \napproved by TDHCA, therefore there must be a disparate approval “practice” \nthat  causes  the  statistical  imbalance.    The  district  court  accepted  this \noversimplified  formulation.    But  under  disparate  impact  law,  the  State’s \nburden is NOT to justify the statistics, but only the facially neutral policy or \n14 \n\n      Case: 12-11211      Document: 00512570522     Page: 15     Date Filed: 03/24/2014\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 227   Filed 04/22/14    Page 15 of 16   PageID 8655\nNo. 12-11211 cons. w/13-10306 \npolicies that caused the statistics.  The State’s burden ensues only when a \nplaintiff isolates the policy that caused the disparity.  Without proof of an \noffending policy, alleged racial imbalance in and of itself is both the cause and \neffect of a violation.  This has not been the law for many years.  The Supreme \nCourt held in Wards Cove that: \n \n“[e]ven if on remand respondents can show that nonwhites are \nunderrepresented . . . in a [statistically correct] manner . . ., this \nalone will not suffice to make out a prima facie case of disparate \nimpact.    Respondents  will  also  have  to  demonstrate  that  the \ndisparity  they  complain  of  is  the  result  of  one  or  more  of  the \nemployment practices that they are attacking here, specifically \nshowing  that  each  challenged  practice  has  a  significantly \ndisparate  impact  on  employment  opportunities  for  whites  and \nnonwhites.  To hold otherwise would result in employers being \npotentially liable for ‘the myriad of innocent causes that may lead \nto statistical imbalances in the composition their work forces.’ ” \n \nWards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 657, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 2125 \n(1989)  (quoting  Watson  v.  Fort  Worth  Bank  &  Trust,  487  U.S.  977,  992, \n108 S. Ct. 2777, 2787 (1988)).  Put more bluntly, if the appellees’ framing of \ndisparate impact analysis is correct, then the NBA is prima facie liable for \ndisparate impact in the hiring of basketball players.   \nAs  the  district  court’s  opinions  demonstrate,  TDHCA's  policies  and \npractices for awarding LIHTC  grants  are anything but simple.  They are \ngoverned by federal and state statutes, which require satisfaction of numerous \ncriteria to ensure the integrity, financial viability, and effectiveness of the \nprojects.  One specific object of the federal tax credit provision is to advantage \nprojects  located  in  low  income  census  tracts  or  subject  to  a  community \nrevitalization plan.  26 U.S.C. § 42(m)(1)(B).  In essence, the appellees are \nseeking a larger share of a fixed pool of tax credits at the expense of other low-\nincome people who might prefer community revitalization.

Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, 2012 WL 3201401\n(N.D. Tex. Aug. 7, 2012) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (“Remedy Opinion”), it noted that its decision to\ndecline to include the “Revitalization Index” in the remedy “does not preclude TDHCA from\nfollowing its usual processes to include the ‘Revitalization Index’ in the QAP.”  Id. at *10\nn.16.  Defendants maintain that, despite this notation, the judgment “order[s] Defendants to\neliminate any other development location criteria.”  Ds. Mot. Alter or Amend Judg. 8.  They\nstate that, “[a]s a result, Defendants are unsure whether they are permitted to use the\nRevitalization Index, a development location criteri[on], in the Dallas metropolitan area if\n\nit was enacted as part of the QAP.”  Id.\nBecause, as noted in the Remedy Opinion, the court did not intend to “preclude\nTDHCA from following its usual processes to include the ‘Revitalization Index’ in the\nQAP,” the court amends the judgment to add the following provision at the end of § IV:\n“Nothing in this judgment precludes TDHCA from following its usual processes to include\nthe Revitalization Index, as set forth in the Plan at 10-11, in the QAP.”\nII\nDefendants maintain that the court should amend the judgment to make clear the\nportions that apply to 4% LIHTCs.  See Ds. Mot. Alter or Amend Judg. 9.  In the Remedy\nOpinion, the court noted “that the Plan [did] not address 4% LIHTC specifically,” but it\nconcluded that “ICP’s objection [did] not identify a specific deficiency in the remedial plan\nthat result[ed] from this omission.”  Inclusive Cmtys., 2012 WL 3201401, at *14.  The court\nalso pointed out that “[t]here are distinctions between 4% and 9% LIHTC in that 4% LIHTC\nare available to all who qualify.  Additionally, parts of the remedial plan would have the\neffect  of  promoting  4%  LIHTC  in  predominantly  Caucasian  areas  (e.g.,  criteria  for\ndisqualifying proposed sites with undesirable features).”  Id.  The court concluded that it\nwould “consider the adequacy of the remedial plan in relation to 4% LIHTC as part of its\nannual review process.”  Id.\nTo clarify that some components of the remedial plan may not apply to 4% LIHTC,\nthe court amends § IV of the judgment so that the part that reads “TDHCA shall, within a\nreasonable time after the entry of this judgment, implement the following affirmative actions\n- 2 -\n\nconcerning the awarding of 4% and 9% LIHTC in the Dallas metropolitan area” is amended\nto read “TDHCA shall, within a reasonable time after the entry of this judgment, implement\nthe following affirmative actions concerning the awarding of 9% LIHTC (and, to the extent\napplicable, 4% LIHTC) in the Dallas metropolitan area.”  As indicated in the Remedy\nOpinion, the court “will consider the adequacy of the remedial plan in relation to 4% LIHTC\nas part of its annual review process.”  Id.  If, for example, the revised language in § IV of the\namended judgment has the effect of permitting TDHCA to administer LIHTC in the Dallas\nmetropolitan area in a manner inconsistent with the FHA—which is expressly prohibited\nunder § III of the amended judgment—the court can revisit this provision and other issues\npertaining to 4% LIHTC as part the annual review process.\nIII\nDefendants maintain that the court should not have taxed costs as it did.  The court\nconcludes that § VIII of the judgment is incorrectly worded and should be revised in the\namended judgment.  \nThe court intended that defendants bear their own taxable costs of court and 50% of\nICP’s taxable costs of court, and that ICP bear the remaining 50% of its own taxable costs\nof court.  Accordingly, the judgment is amended so that § VIII provides: “Defendants shall\nbear their own taxable costs of court.  ICP shall recover 50% of its taxable costs of court, as\ncalculated by the clerk of court, from defendants and shall bear the remaining 50% of its own\ntaxable costs of court, as calculated by the clerk of court.”\n- 3 -\n\nIV\nExcept as granted in this memorandum opinion and order, defendants’ motion to alter\nor amend judgment or, alternatively, for new trial is denied.\n*     *     *\nDefendants’ September 4, 2012 motion to alter or amend judgment or, alternatively,\nfor new trial is granted in part and denied in part.\nSO ORDERED.\nNovember 8, 2012.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

ICP recognizes that in the event TDHCA is found \nliable, the defendants should be given the opportunity to propose a remedial plan for \nconsideration. \nICP objects to defendants’ attempt in its summary of defenses to reurge the 11th \nAmendment immunity issue that defendants have withdrawn from consideration. ICP suggests \nthat the Court decide the issue on the briefing and Appendix previously submitted by the parties. \nDefendants’ summary of defenses. \nThe Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (“TDHCA”) and several of its \ncurrent or former board members and its Executive Director, each sued only in their official \ncapacities (the “Individual Defendants”) (TDHCA and the Individual Defendants, may \nsometimes hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Defendants”), contend as follows: \nThe Defendants have not discriminated on the basis of the race either of the likely tenant \npopulation nor that of the surrounding community in their allocation of credits under the Low \nIncome Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) program established under Section 42 of the Internal \nRevenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 42.  Plaintiff ICP has not proved, nor will it be able to prove at trial, \nthat Defendants, in their administration of the LIHTC program have violated either §§ 3604(a) or \n3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), 3605(a).  Nor has ICP proved, nor will it \nbe able to prove at trial, that Defendants have violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 1982.   \n \n2 \n632283.1   \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 146   Filed 08/25/11    Page 3 of 12   PageID 5445\n \nSection 42 of the Internal Revenue Code directs each state’s housing credit agency (in \nthis case for the State of the Texas, the TDHCA) to establish a Qualified Allocation Plan (a \n“QAP”) for the allocation of LIHTC credits which, among other matters, must -  \n(i)  set[] forth selection criteria to be used to determine housing priorities of the \nhousing credit agency which are appropriate to local conditions,  \n(ii)  give[] preference in allocating housing credit dollar amounts among selected \nprojects to- \n(I)  projects serving the lowest income tenants,  \n(II)  projects obligated to serve qualified tenants for the longest periods, and  \n(III)  projects which are located in qualified census tracts (as defined in subsection \n(d)(5)(C)) and the development of which contributes to a concerted community revitalization \nplan. \n26 U.S.C. §42(m)(1)(B).  In Texas the Legislature has authorized and directed the \nTDHCA to propose on an annual basis a QAP, after an opportunity for public review and \ncomment, for approval by the Governor.  That authority has been set forth in the provisions of \nthe Texas Government Code (the “Code”), has been amended from time to time since the \ninception of the LIHTC program in 1986, and is currently found in the provisions of Subchapter \nDD of Chapter 2506 of the Code. \nPlaintiff, Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (“ICP”), does not challenge either \nTDHCA’s QAPs or the state and federal legislative choices reflected in those plans.  Further, \nICP has expressly stated that it does not base its complaints upon the provisions of 42 U.S.C. § \n3608(d) which generally obligate federal agencies in their housing programs to affirmatively \n \n3 \n632283.1   \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 146   Filed 08/25/11    Page 4 of 12   PageID 5446\n \nfurther fair housing goals.   \nConsidering these two important clarifications by ICP in its briefing before this Court, \nICP is left with its claim that the TDHCA has the discretion to allocate, and in the exercise of its \ndiscretion, is legally required to allocate more LIHTC credits to units or projects in \npredominately white areas, and in particular, in predominately white areas in the Dallas \nmetropolitan area in which ICP operates.  Contrary to ICP’s assertions, however, TDHCA does \nnot have unlimited discretion in the making of its LIHTC allocations.  First, by the nature of the \nprogram, the Defendants do not select the location of nor directly make available any housing to \nthe populations for whom the housing is developed.  Each of those functions or activities are in \nthe hands of private developers, and are also subject to a variety of local governmental \nrestrictions or involvement, such as zoning or land use regulations.  Second, the decisions on \nwhich projects will be allocated LIHTC credits are currently made, and have been since at least \n2001, under an objective point system set forth in each year’s QAP, but subject to various \nprovisions of the Code setting for factors which must be given priority and following under \napplicable opinions of the Texas Attorney General.  Moreover, the current version of the statutes \ngoverning TDHCA’s decisions date back to 2001, following a period in which ostensibly greater \ndiscretion led to allegations of corruption and actual convictions for criminal misconduct.  The \ncurrent legislative policy favors governmental interests of accountability, transparency and \npredictability in the application of the policies of both the Federal and State legislation governing \nthe LIHTC program. \nDespite the Court’s opinion on the partial summary judgment motions to the contrary, \nDefendants continue to contest that ICP has met its prima facie burdens under the causes of \n \n4 \n632283.1   \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 146   Filed 08/25/11    Page 5 of 12   PageID 5447\n \naction asserted.  The statistics, when critically viewed under appropriate statistical analysis do \nnot establish a disparate impact nor a discriminatory intent and do not support ICP’s claims \nunder the Fair Housing Act, the Fourteenth Amendment or 42 U.S.C. § 1982.  In this regard, \nDefendants reassert their challenges to ICP’s experts under Daubert, which this Court did not \nresolve in ruling upon the partial summary judgment motions. \nDefendants contend that the proof at trial will establish, among other matters, that over \n130 LIHTC projects have been approved and are currently in service in Walker Target Area \nTracts.  Walker Target Area Tracts are the census tracts in which ICP is mandated by the various \nsettlements in the Walker Litigation to attempt to place its clients.  Those tracts are deemed by \nthe applicable orders in the Walker Litigation to be predominately white for the remedial \npurposes of that litigation.  Moreover, and in contrast, ICP has alleged that only 27 projects in \nthat same area [and no projects were specifically identified as impermissibly denied in any other \nregion] were denied for racial reasons, and that, indeed, only 7 of those were denied in the period \nfollowing the 2001 amendments to the State Legislation, with none allegedly denied since 2006.  \nDefendants will also show that each QAP makes changes and that as either the Federal or State \nlegislation has been amended, especially in recent years, the QAPs, and hence the point scoring \nprovisions for the application for LIHTC credits, have increasing favored developments in what \nICP contends are high opportunity areas and have attempted to curtail further development of \nLIHTC projects in areas of high concentration. \nWith respect to ICP’s claim under the FHA, the evidence will show that, because the \ndemand for LIHTCs so greatly exceeds the supply, the TDHCA does not make housing \nunavailable by denying an application for LIHTCs.  Instead, the evidence will show, the TDHCA \n \n5 \n632283.1   \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 146   Filed 08/25/11    Page 6 of 12   PageID 5448\n \nmakes available the greatest amount of housing it can by awarding the greatest number of \nLIHTCs that TDHCA is authorized to award in each year.  ICP’s chief complaint is actually that \nthe TDHCA does not make housing available in the locations ICP and its clients prefer.  The \nevidence will show that the TDHCA makes housing available without any consideration of the \nrace of ICP’s clients or any other person who utilizes government-sponsored programs.  \nWherever LIHTC supported housing developments are located, people of any race are welcome \nto reside in such developments.  Accordingly, the TDHCA does not make housing unavailable, \nbe it based on race or otherwise.   \nAssuming for the sake of argument that ICP will satisfy its prima facie burden, ICP will \nnot be able to sustain its claims because no discriminatory impact or intent has been proved, and \nin any event, the Defendants’ actions have met compelling governmental interests and were \nimplemented without pretext.   \nAdditionally, Defendants contend that the applicable 2 year statutes of limitation bar any \nclaims for liability for allocation decisions made more than 2 years before the filing of this suit.  \nThus, any conduct prior to that 2 year period cannot be used as a basis for the mandatory, \ninjunctive relief sought by ICP.    \nFinally, TDHCA is immune from suit under the 11th Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \nLR 16.4.b. a statement of stipulated facts. \nNone. \nLR 16.4.c. a list of contested issues of fact. \nICP’s list of contested issues of fact. \n \n6 \n632283.1   \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 146   Filed 08/25/11    Page 7 of 12   PageID 5449\n \nThe only contested issues of fact for trial are: \nWhether the circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent establishes by a \npreponderance of the evidence that race was a determinative reason for the housing decisions by \nTDHCA that resulted in the present racially segregated pattern of the location of LIHTC units. \nWhether the defendants’ proffered reason or reasons for the racially segregated pattern of \nthe location of LIHTC units are pretextual. \nWhether, if the defendants assert a compelling governmental interest as a defense, the \ndefendants’ evidence establishes the facts necessary to support the elements of that defense: (1) \nwhether TDHCA’s actions in fact further  the governmental interest asserted; (2) whether the \npublic interest served by TDHCA’s actions is constitutionally permissible and is substantial \nenough to outweigh the private detriment caused by it; and (3) whether less drastic means are \navailable whereby the stated governmental interest may be attained. This issue also involves a \ndetermination of law. \nICP objects to the defendants’ attempt to make the fact issues determined as a matter of \nlaw in the summary judgment proceedings contested issues of fact. \nICP objects to the defendants attempt to raise a new defense, statute of limitations, as a \ncontested issue of fact.  \nDefendants’ list of contested issues of fact. \n1.  Whether the statistical proof and other evidence relied upon by the Court in its \nSeptember 28, 2010 Memorandum Opinion finding that ICP had met its prima facie burdens \nunder the causes of action asserted were accurate and support that determination? \n2.

In the event the Court determines any of issues 5 or 6 in favor Plaintiff, ICP, then \nwhether Defendants’ explanations regarding the reasons for such actions were pretextual? \n9.  In the event the Court determines any of issues 1 through 7 in favor of Plaintiff, \nICP, then whether any such actions giving rise to those findings occurred on or after March 28, \n2006 [2 years before the filing date]? \n \n8 \n632283.1   \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 146   Filed 08/25/11    Page 9 of 12   PageID 5451\n \nLR 16.4.d. a list of contested issues of law. \nICP’s list of contested issues of law. \nWhether facts established by the evidence show a violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3604(a) and § 3605, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, actionable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, and a violation of 42 U.S.C. §  1982. \nDefendants’ list of contested issues of law. \n1.  Whether Defendants have rebutted the prima facie finding by this Court in its \nSeptember 28, 2010 Order (see Order at fn. 15)? \n2.  Whether, if Plaintiff has met its prima facie burdens, Defendants have established \na compelling governmental interest for the actions they have taken? \n3.  Whether, if Plaintiff has met its prima facie burdens, Plaintiff has proven that \nDefendants’ explanations for the actions they have taken were pretextual? \n4.  Whether Plaintiff has proven that Defendants have taken race into account in the \ndecisions to allocate LIHTC credits in violation of Sections 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the Fair \nHousing Act or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as made actionable \nby 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or under 42 U.S.C. § 1982? \n5.  Even if Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination and offered \nevidence that Defendants’ justification is false, whether this Court, as a rational fact finder can \nconclude from the evidence adduced at trial that Defendants’ actions were discriminatory (see \nSeptember 28, 2010 Order at 33).? \n6.

Whether TDHCA is immune from suit under the 11th Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution? \n8.  Whether the remedy proposed by Plaintiff for Defendants alleged violations is \nsufficiently and narrowly tailored to meet the alleged violations? \n9.  Whether the remedy proposed by Plaintiff for Defendants’ alleged violations is an \nimpermissible and unconstitutional race conscious remedy? \n10.  Defendants contend that they only withdrew the immunity defense in connection \nwith their summary judgment motion and that the applicable statutes of limitations were pled in \nDefendants’ Answer. \nLR 16.4.e. an estimate of length of trial. \nICP’s estimate of length of trial \nICP estimates that the testimony of its witnesses including expert witnesses can be \ncompleted in two days. Additional time could be necessary depending on the objections to ICP’s \nevidence that require testimony to resolve. \nDefendants’ estimate of length of trial. \nDefendants believe that their case can be presented in two to two and one-half days, \ninclusive of anticipated cross examination of Defendants’ witnesses by Plaintiff. \nLR 16.4.f. a list of additional matters that might aid in the disposition of the case. \nICP’s statement of additional matters that might aid in the disposition of the case. \n \n10 \n632283.1   \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 146   Filed 08/25/11    Page 11 of 12   PageID 5453\n \nSome of ICP’s exhibits are summary exhibits that involve TDHCA or other government \ndata including U.S. Census information.

This could expedite the consideration of the \nadmissibility of the exhibits. \nDefendant’s statement of additional matters that might aid in the disposition of the case. \nDefendants acknowledge Plaintiff’s offer regarding interviews of its witnesses on matters \npredicate to the admissibility of certain documents.  Defendants will make a similar offer to \nPlaintiff should it so desire. \nDefendants believe the parties can fruitfully discuss further the possibility of stipulations \nas to both facts and certain documents to avoid duplication. \nDefendants also believe that an early pretrial conference may be useful in resolving any \nissues as to the order of proof given the Court’s findings in its September 28, 2010 Order. \nDefendants also seek a ruling on their renewed Daubert motion to be filed today. \nSO ORDERED. \n  August 25, 2011. \n_________________________________ \nSIDNEY A.

The parties\nthereafter tried the balance of the case in a bench trial.  In a memorandum opinion and order filed\nMarch 20, 2012, the court found in favor of ICP on its disparate impact claim under §§ 3604(a) and\n3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), and in favor of defendants on all other claims.  In a\nmemorandum opinion and order filed today, the court adopts a remedial plan for addressing the FHA\nviolation.\nFor the reasons set out in the memorandum opinions and orders filed September 28, 2010,\nMarch 20, 2012, and today, it is ordered and adjudged as follows:\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 2 of 29   PageID 7522\nII\nAs used in this judgment, the terms “TDHCA” and “defendants” mean, collectively,\ndefendants Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs and its Executive Director and\nboard members in their official capacities.

The term “LIHTC” means Low Income Housing Tax Credits awarded under a QAP.\nIII\nTDHCA, its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and all those in active\nconcert or participation with it who receive actual notice of this judgment by personal service or\notherwise, are enjoined from administering the LIHTC program in the Dallas metropolitan area in\na manner inconsistent with the FHA.\nIV\nTDHCA shall, within a reasonable time after the entry of this judgment, implement the\nfollowing affirmative actions concerning the awarding of 4% and 9% LIHTC in the Dallas\nmetropolitan area:\nA. include in the QAP as an additional below-the-line criteria the “Opportunity Index,”\nas set forth in the Plan at 6-7; \nB. include in the QAP the additional below-the-line criteria regarding the quality of\npublic education and anti-concentration, and remove all other “Development Location”\ncriteria, as set forth in the Plan at 7-8;\nC.  continue to include in the QAP a 130% basis boost for proposed developments in\n- 2  -\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 3 of 29   PageID 7523\nhigh opportunity areas (“HOAs”);\nD.  continue to include in the QAP criteria for disqualifying proposed development sites\nthat have undesirable features, as set forth in the Plan at 11-13, and incorporate the more\nrobust process of identifying and addressing other potentially undesirable site features, as\nset forth in the Plan at 13-14;\nE.  promulgate by rule a fair housing choice disclosure that must be given to prospective\ntenants and maintain a website providing information as to tax-credit assisted properties, as\nset forth in the Plan at 18;\nF. conduct an annual disparate impact analysis, as set forth in the Plan at 18-19;\nG.  provide  a  mechanism  to  challenge  public  comments  that  cause proposed\ndevelopments to receive negative points, as set forth in the Plan at 19, and include in the\nQAP the additional two-point below-the-line criterion regarding support or neutrality from\na neighborhood organization that previously opposed a development and an associated\ndebarment rule, as set forth in the Plan at 19-20;\nH. adopt a tie breaker, in the event of a tie in scoring a 9% application, that favors an\napplication proposing development in an HOA; and\nI. each calendar year, no later than 120 days after the TDHCA Board of Directors\nissues final commitments for allocations of LIHTC, file the annual report with the clerk of\ncourt, in accordance with the memorandum opinion and order filed today.\n- 3  -\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 4 of 29   PageID 7524\nV\nThe remedial plan adopted by this judgment shall be effective for a period of five years after\nthe first annual report is filed.  During this period, the court shall retain jurisdiction.  At such earlier\ntime, if any, that TDHCA or another party can demonstrate that, as to the Dallas metropolitan area, \nthe remedial plan adopted by this judgment has ensured that no future violations of the FHA will\noccur and has removed any lingering effects of past discrimination, it may move the court to\nterminate all or specific provisions of this judgment and/or the remedial plan.\nVI\nThe objections and supplement to objections of intervenor Frazier Revitalization Inc. to the\nPlan, as adopted by this judgment as components of the remedial plan, are denied.\nVII\nExcept for ICP’s disparate impact claim under the FHA, ICP’s claims against defendants are\ndismissed with prejudice.

Certain  clarifying  remarks  are \nprovided to explain to the Court and to the Plaintiff why certain propounded ways to provide \nremedial measures are not being offered in this Plan.  To the extent that some of these clarifying \nremarks relate to matters of public record which occurred after the closing of the record in these \nproceedings,  Defendant  Texas  Department  of  Housing  and  Community  Affairs  (the \n“Department”) is prepared to offer such support by way of affidavits of fact or sworn testimony \nas the Court may deem necessary.  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 1 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 7 of 29   PageID 7527\nIntroduction and Background \nWhen the Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP) for 2012 (the “2012 QAP”) was submitted to \nGovernor Perry to approve, reject, or modify and approve in accordance with Tex. Gov’t. Code, \n§2306.6724(b),  Governor  Perry  approved  the  2012  QAP  with  modifications.    Those \nmodifications clearly limited the use of discretion by the Department’s Governing Board by \ncurtailing the ability of the Department to make awards of forward commitments of low income \nhousing tax credits (LIHTCs) and by narrowing the conditions under which that Governing \nBoard could approve waivers under the 2012 QAP.  That signal was consistent with the limited \ndiscretion provided by statute, as confirmed by opinions issued by the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral.  Thus, with regard to the proposal of this Plan, Department staff has endeavored to \nstructure a proposal that strives to create a legally-supportable framework in which future QAPs \ncan achieve the objectives of race neutral dispersion of LIHTC assisted developments within the \nremedial plan area by fashioning clear requirements, which are reasonably calculated to yield the \nintended result.  Because this is a process with numerous variables, not least of which is the \ncomplex decision-making process that developers undergo in selecting their proposed sites, this \nPlan will require annual analysis and, as needed, recalibration.   \nIn addition to the limitations on discretion in the 2012 QAP, that rule took a new and \nsignificant policy direction towards the development and  intended successful implementation of \nmeasures  to    generate  a  greater  level  of  tax  credit-assisted  development  activity  in  high \nopportunity areas.  The results to date of these strong actions, actions already taken that set the \nstage for significant high opportunity activity in the area covered by these proceedings, are \npublicly  available.    On  the  Department’s  website  the  current  status  report  of  the  2012 \ncompetitive 9% tax credit round shows that a significant number of competitive applications in \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 2 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 8 of 29   PageID 7528\nhigh opportunity areas have been submitted in Urban Region 3 with 16 of the applications \nlocated in such areas, many of which indicate they are  top scoring applications.   \nThe graphic below shows compellingly that actions already taken by the Department \nhave  materially  changed  the  overall  character  of  the  competitive  LIHTC  round  in  2012, \npromoting overwhelming interest in high opportunity areas.   \n \nIn applicant-initiated appeals and requests for waivers the Board has taken seriously the \nlimitations placed on its discretion and deliberated extensively in publicly conducted, transcribed \nmeetings, leading to results that have closely followed the 2012 QAP.  The Board has considered \nwaivers only in truly exceptional and compelling circumstances where failure to grant the waiver \nwould result in a clear failure to make the opportunity to compete available throughout the state.  \nIt  is  the  Department’s  belief  that  this  proposed  Remedial  Plan  offers  meaningful \nimprovements on the path already forged in the 2012 QAP and creates concepts which, if \nsuccessful, can nurture and reinforce future QAPs.  The Plan embraces the notion of providing \nmaximum permissible incentives for areas that truly reflect the greatest opportunity, namely \nthose areas with the highest income, lowest poverty, and best public education opportunities.   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 3 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 9 of 29   PageID 7529\nAs set forth more fully in §12, captioned “Plan subject to statutory constraints,” the \nDepartment  operates  under  several  layers  of  complex  legal  requirements,  including  the \ncongressional  statement  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §42(m)  that  the  Department  must  give \npreference to “projects which are located in qualified census tracts (as defined in subsection \n(d)(5)(C)) and the development of which contributes to a concerted community revitalization \nplan…”.  Furthermore, the statutory schema for scoring of LIHTC competitive applications \nunder QAPs is driven largely by TEX. GOV’T. CODE, §2306.6710, which has not been questioned \nin these proceedings and, presumably, must be adhered to in developing and administering future \nQAPs.  Two of the key remedial tools proffered by the Plaintiff are the use of discretion, as \ndiscussed above, and the creation of set-asides.  With respect to set-asides, it is open to question \nwhether there is statutory authority for the Department to create set-asides in addition to those set \nforth  in  TEX.  GOV’T.  CODE,  Chapter  2306.    Even  if,  arguendo,  creating  set-asides  were \nauthorized, the suggestion to create a set-aside in the remedial area is problematic because that \narea is but a portion of a larger region pursuant to statute and to which the Department must \nregionally allocate LIHTCs.   \nAs a result of these limitations and premises, the Department is proposing a Plan which \nfocuses on: (1) according proposed developments located in defined high opportunity areas the \ngreatest incentives allowed by state law; and, (2) according developments in Qualified Census \nTracts (QCTs) that are part of true concerted revitalization plans co-equal incentives in order to \nprovide the preference created by Internal Revenue Code §42(m).  It is envisioned that the \nrevitalization incentive will set a very high threshold, making it unlikely to yield a number of \nsuccessful applicants in QCTs such that would perpetuate any discriminatory patterns found to \nhave occurred unintentionally.   \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 4 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 10 of 29   PageID 7530\nPlaintiff  has  requested  that  4%  non-competitive  LIHTCs  be  addressed  in  this  plan.   \nBecause of restrictions of federal law, states do not have the ability to designate the 130% basis \nboost for 4% LIHTC’s, and therefore the only 4% LIHTC’s eligible for the 130% basis boost are \ndevelopments in federally designated QCTs and difficult to develop areas (DDAs).  \nThe development and implementation of this Plan and the development of future QAPs in \naccordance with this Plan will be a matter to which the Department, in collaboration with \nPlaintiff, the Department’s oversight bodies, and the public, will continue to work to develop \nmore nuanced and effective ideas to achieve an optimal dispersion of LIHTC developments.  In \ndeveloping this remedial plan for the subject Dallas metro area, the Department intends to apply \nsome of these concepts, or similar concepts to the remainder of the state; however, certain other \nregions will need specifically tailored plans due to differing demographics and other factors. \n1.  Use of discretion - waivers.  \nIn approving the 2012 QAP, Governor Perry determined that the continuation of the \nability to make awards of forward commitments was not desirable and that in exercising its \ndiscretion to waive any aspect of the QAP the Board should only grant waivers when doing so \nwas necessary to further a purpose or policy enunciated in Tex. Gov’t. Code, Chapter 2306.  \n2.  Strengthened definition of a High Opportunity Area (HOA). \nIn the development of its 2012 QAP, the Department adopted a strengthened definition of \na high opportunity area; and, under the scoring criterion of development location, provided 4 \ncompetitive points for a development proposing a location in a HOA.  In order to qualify as \nbeing in an HOA, a development must be in a census tract that has BOTH a low incidence of \npoverty AND an above median income as well as being located in an area served by either \nrecognized  elementary  schools  or  having  a  significant  and  accessible  element  of  public \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 5 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 11 of 29   PageID 7531\ntransportation.  The  Department  currently  anticipates  that  the  highest  four  scoring  2012 \napplications in Urban Region 3 are located within the 5 county remedial area, are located in \nHOAs,  and  are  within  the  attendance  zones  of  recognized  or  exemplary  rated  elementary \nschools.  The Department further anticipates awards in Urban Region 3 will be limited to no \nmore than 6 applications due to the amount of 9% credits available for allocation. \nIn future QAPs, the Department is committed to continuing to strengthen the criteria for \nlocating developments within HOAs. The Department will create a new “Opportunity Index” in \norder  to  incentivize  applications  to  locate  developments  in  the  highest  income  and  lowest \npoverty areas of the remedial area. At the same time, applicants that propose projects in areas of \nhigh opportunity that do not meet the most stringent criteria will still be incentivized, albeit to a \nlesser degree. The proposed Opportunity Index is reflected in the following chart. The highest \n“below the line” (scoring items ranking lower than statutorily required scoring items) point value \nwill be assigned to the highest category within the Opportunity Index (actual point values may \nchange commensurate with changes in the above the line statutory scoring criteria). \nPoints  Population  Poverty Factor  Income Factor  School Quality \nServed  Factor \n7 Points  General use  <15% rate for all  Tract in top quartile of  “Exemplary” or \nindividuals  median household income  “Recognized” \nfor county or, for site in an  elementary \nMetropolitan Statistical  school \nArea (MSA), top quartile \nfor MSA \n5 Points  General use  <15% rate for all  Tract in top 2 quartiles of  “Exemplary” or \nindividuals  median household income  “Recognized” \nfor county or, for site in an  elementary \nMSA, top 2 quartiles for  school \nMSA \n5 Points  Any  <15% rate for all  Tract in top quartile of  “Exemplary” or \nindividuals  median household income  “Recognized” \nfor county or, for site in an  elementary \nMSA, top quartile for  school \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 6 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 12 of 29   PageID 7532\nMSA \n3 Points  Any  <15% rate for all  Tract in top quartile of  N/A \nindividuals  median household income \nfor county or, for site in an \nMSA, top quartile for \nMSA \n1 Point  Any  <15% rate for all  Tract in top 2 quartiles of  N/A \nindividuals  median household income \nfor county or, for site in an \nMSA, top 2 quartiles for \nMSA \nUp to 7 Points  Any  The proposed development site is located in a QCT for which there \nis in effect a concerted revitalization plan (consistent with the \nelements described in §5.  See Revitalization Index, §4, below.   \nThe  Department  will  utilize  data  from  the  5-year  American  Community  Survey  to \ndetermine  a  development  site’s  qualification  under  the  poverty  and  income  criteria.  For \ncategories requiring an “Exemplary” or “Recognized” elementary school, the development site \nmust be located within the school attendance zone that has the applicable academic rating, as of \nthe beginning of the Application Acceptance Period, or comparable rating if the rating system \nchanges  by  the  same  date  as  determined  by  the  Texas  Education  Agency.  An  elementary \nattendance zone does not include elementary schools with district-wide possibility of enrollment \nor no defined attendance zones, sometimes known as magnet schools. However, districts with \ndistrict-wide enrollment and only one elementary school are acceptable. \nThe following additional factors, indicative of educational quality and opportunity or lack \nof affordable housing, will be incorporated as new below-the-line criteria:  \na.  Location within the attendance zone of a public school with an academic rating of \n“Recognized” or “Exemplary” (or comparable rating) by the Texas Education Agency (up to 3 \npoints): \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 7 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 13 of 29   PageID 7533\nA.  1 points if it is both an elementary school, and either a middle school or high \nschool; or \nB.  3 points if it is an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school. \nb.  A municipality or, if outside of the boundaries of any municipality, a county that has \nnever received a competitive tax credit allocation.  The application must also comply with all \nother anti-concentration provisions (2 points for general use/family or supportive housing; 1 \npoint for elderly). \nAll other Development Location incentive criteria in the current QAP, such as incentives \nfor developments in central business districts, will be removed in future QAPs, unless required \nby statute, in order to maintain high incentives to target HOAs.   \n3.  130% basis boost for transactions in HOAs. \nUnder the authority granted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, P. L. \n110-289, the 2012 QAP offers a 130% basis boost for transactions assisted by 9% LIHTCs that \nare located in HOAs as defined in paragraph 2, above. \nThe Department will continue to include in its QAPs a 130% basis boost for applications \nthat are intended to be located in HOAs.  This requirement will not preclude or limit the \nDepartment’s ability to offer a lawful basis boost in other appropriate instances. The authority \nfor states to define criteria for a 130% boost  for non-competitive 4% housing tax credit or tax-\nexempt bond developments is not available under §42 of the Internal Revenue Code.  \n4.  The remedial balance and the Revitalization Index.   \nThe  Opportunity  Index  clearly  provides  the  greatest  point  incentives  for  HOA \ntransactions  that  serve  the  general  public,  including  families,  that  are  also  in  areas  of \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 8 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 14 of 29   PageID 7534\nsignificantly greater income, the top quartile.  While a proposed transaction in a second quartile \ntract,  a  proposed  transaction  in  the  top  quartile  serving  a  targeted,  albeit  legally  targeted, \npopulation rather than the general population, or even a proposed transaction in a second quartile \ntract serving an elderly population would be characterized as HOA, it is clear that in order to \nachieve the spirit and intent of the Plan, it is only that top quartile/general population plan should \nreceive that greatest level of recognition for competitive enhancement.  This Plan does propose a \nmechanism allowing for a similar prioritization for a proposed transaction in a qualified census \ntract (QCT) that is the subject of a concerted plan of community revitalization, as federally \nmandated by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) §42(m).  The Department contends that failure to \ngrant same preference for such transactions could be seen as inconsistent with federal law.  \nHowever, the Department is well aware of the fact that a significant level of continuing activity \nin  development  in  QCTs  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  remedial  objectives  of  this  Plan.   \nTherefore, it is critical to note that in developing this language, Department strongly believes that \nthe high thresholds established for revitalization plans will demand significant investments of \ntime, analysis, and local commitments of funding for non-housing activity from an applicant. \nAccordingly, these points are unlikely to achieve in the natal cycle after approval of a Remedial \nPlan, a significant number of applications that can demonstrably earn the maximum points for \nbeing in a QCT AND having in place a revitalization plan meeting the substantive criteria \nproposed.   \nAs the graphic below conveys, changes implemented in the 2012 QAP have clearly \nresulted in a virtual curtailment of QCT activity.  While such a curtailment might be viewed as \naccelerating a catch-up to restore a more balanced distribution of assisted developments in areas \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 9 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 15 of 29   PageID 7535\nof all income levels, it would not be consistent with a prospective race neutral distribution or the \ncongressionally expressed preferences set forth in the IRC.   \n \nTherefore, the Department believes that it is appropriate for an application in the area of \ngreatest opportunity to be given coequal incentives with an application achieving the greatest \nrevitalization purpose.  Without this balance the Plan would in effect be forsaking that sector of \nthe  community  in  greatest  need  of  this  federal  assistance.    However,  it  is  a  generally \nacknowledged  contention  that  tax  credit  developers  have  been  able  to  marshal  community \nsupport to validate the conclusions that they were meeting the objectives of IRC §42(m) possibly \nwhere meaningful non-housing revitalization activity was not occurring.  In order to assure that \nsuch efforts involve meaningful substance and do not create an unregulated opportunity to \ncharacterize  an  effort  as  revitalization  that  may  not  be  meaningful  and  substantive,  the \nDepartment has developed a concept similar to the Opportunity Index to address revitalization.    \nRevitalization index: \nPoints  Population  Criteria \nserved \n7 points  Any  The proposed development site is located in a QCT in which there is in effect a \nconcerted revitalization plan (consistent with the elements described in §5 and the \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 10 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 16 of 29   PageID 7536\nnon-housing costs, as reflected in the local government certified plan budget, \nexceed $25,000 per unit in the proposed development.    \n3 points  Any  The proposed development site is located in a QCT in which there is in effect a \nconcerted revitalization plan (consistent with the elements described in §5 and the \nnon-housing costs, as reflected in the local government certified plan budget, \nexceed $10,000 per unit but are less than $25,000 per unit.    \n2 points  Any   The proposed development site is not located in a QCT but there is in effect a \nconcerted revitalization plan (consistent with the elements described in §5 and the \nnon-housing costs, as reflected in the local government certified plan budget, \nexceed $10,000 per unit.    \nAn application seeking to receive points under the Revitalization Plan must provide the \nplan and plan budget for review at pre-application and provide substantiation of the budget \nthrough submittal of a local government certified copy of the plan and budget supporting the \nclaimed points at full application. \n5.  Strengthened  criteria  for  disqualifying  proposed  sites  that  have  undesirable \nfeatures.  \nIn the 2012 QAP, the Department included criteria for disqualifying proposed sites that \nhave undesirable features, as follows: \n(13) Development Sites with negative characteristics in subparagraphs \n(A)  -  (G)  of  this  paragraph  will  be  considered  ineligible.  If  Staff \nidentifies what it believes would constitute an unacceptable negative \nsite feature not covered by the those identified in subparagraphs (A) - \n(G) of this paragraph Staff may seek Board clarification and, after \nholding  a  hearing  before  the  Board,  the  Board  may  make  a  final \ndetermination as to whether that feature is unacceptable. Rehabilitation \n(excluding Reconstruction) Developments with ongoing and existing \nfederal  assistance  from  HUD  or  TRDO-USDA  are  exempt.  For \npurposes of this exhibit, the term 'adjacent' is interpreted as sharing a \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 11 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 17 of 29   PageID 7537\nboundary with the Development Site. The distances are to be measured \nfrom the nearest boundary of the Development Site to the boundary of \nthe negative characteristic. If none of these negative characteristics \nexist,  the  Applicant  must  sign  a  certification  to  that  effect.  The \nnegative characteristics include:  \n(A) developments located adjacent to or within 300 feet of junkyards;  \n(B) developments  located  adjacent  to  or  within  300  feet  of  active \nrailroad  tracks,  unless  the  Applicant  provides  evidence  that  the \ncity/community has adopted a Railroad Quiet Zone or the railroad in \nquestion is commuter or light rail (Developments located in a Central \nBusiness District are exempt);  \n(C) developments  located  adjacent  to  or  within  300  feet  of  heavy \nindustrial uses such as manufacturing plants, refinery blast zones, etc.;  \n(D) developments located adjacent to or within 300 feet of a solid \nwaste or sanitary landfills;  \n(E) developments where the buildings are located within the easement \nof  any  overhead  high  voltage  transmission  line  or  inside  the \nengineered  fall  distance  of  any  support  structure  for  high  voltage \ntransmission lines, radio antennae, satellite towers, etc. This does not \napply to local service electric lines and poles;  \n(F) developments where the buildings are located within the accident \nzones or clear zones for commercial or military airports; or  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 12 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 18 of 29   PageID 7538\n(G) development is located adjacent to or within 300 feet of a sexually-\noriented business. For purposes of this paragraph, a sexually-oriented \nbusiness  shall  be  defined  as  stated  in  §243.002  of  the  Texas \nGovernment Code.   \nAs a part of the Plan, the Department will continue to include the same or similar criteria \nin its QAPs for disqualifying proposed sites that have undesirable features. Additionally, the \nDepartment will incorporate a more robust process to identify and address other potentially \nundesirable  site  features  in  future  QAPs.  Under  this  criterion,  an  applicant  proposing \ndevelopment of multifamily housing with tax credits must disclose to the Department and may \nobtain the Department’s written notification of pre-clearance if the site involves any negative site \nfeatures at the proposed site or within 1000 feet of the proposed site such as the following: \na.  A history of significant or recurring flooding; \nb.  A hazardous waste site or a source of localized hazardous emissions, whether \nremediated or not; \nc.  Heavy industrial use; \nd.  Active railways (other than commuter trains); \ne.  Landing strips or heliports; \nf.  Significant presence of blighted structures; \ng.  Fire hazards which will increase the fire insurance premiums for the proposed \nsite; \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 13 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 19 of 29   PageID 7539\nh.  Locally known presence of gang activity, prostitution, drug trafficking, or other \nsignificant criminal activity that rises to the level of frequent police reports.  \nThe Department will develop a process for the efficient, timely resolution of the pre-\nclearance process.  The Department may require that disclosure occur on an expedited basis, \nincluding but not limited to during the pre-application process.  The Department will review \nthese matters as disclosed to them and will either issue or withhold a pre-clearance.  The \nstandard to be employed will be that the pre-clearance will be withheld if one or more of the \nfactors enumerated above are present at or within 1000 feet of the proposed site and are of a \nnature that would not be typical in a neighborhood that would qualify for HOA points under the \nOpportunity Index. An applicant providing disclosure will be encouraged to provide any plans \nfor mitigation of the present undesirable feature(s), which may include a concerted community \nrevitalization plan as described in §5.  \nIn  assessing  disclosures  the  Department  staff  may,  at  its  discretion,  conduct  a  site \ninspection.  Non-disclosure of any of the enumerated conditions if known or in the exercise of \nreasonable  diligence  could  have  been  ascertained  is  a  basis  for  withholding  pre-clearance.  \nWithholding or denial of pre-clearance may be appealed pursuant to the appeals process set forth \nin the applicable QAP. \nWith  respect  to  the  presence  or  absence  of  hazardous  waste  sites  or  emissions,  an \napplicant may rely on the required Phase I Environmental Site Assessment.  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 14 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 20 of 29   PageID 7540\n6.  Strengthening of incentives for applications in qualified census tracts where the \nhousing is part of a concerted community revitalization plan. \nConsistent with §42(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 2012 QAP offers incentives for \napplications in qualified census tracts and for applications in areas where the housing is a \nnecessary component of a community revitalization plan. In future QAPs, the Department will \nstrengthen the correlation between revitalization and development located in qualified census \ntracts and the requirements for establishing that true community revitalization is occurring and \nthat affordable housing is a necessary part of the revitalization and will continue to provide \nappropriate incentives for affordable rental housing developments meeting such strengthened \ncriteria.   \nBeginning with its 2013 QAP, the Department will establish a scoring criteria in which \nany application for low income housing tax credits located in a qualified census tract, as defined \nin §42(d)(5)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code, will be eligible for enhanced points, based on its \nlocation, if there is, as described below, a concerted revitalization plan that is in effect and to \nwhich the development will contribute.   \nA concerted community revitalization plan adopted by a municipality or county will be \ndeemed to exist based on the following: \na.  A community revitalization plan must have been adopted by the municipality or \ncounty in which the proposed development is intended to be located.  \nb.  The adopting municipality or county must have performed, in a process providing \nfor public input, an assessment of the factors in need of being addressed as a part of such \ncommunity revitalization plan.  Factors to be considered include the following: \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 15 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 21 of 29   PageID 7541\nA.  adverse environmental conditions, natural or manmade, that are material in \nnature  and  are  inconsistent  with  the  general  quality  of  life  in  typical  average  income \nneighborhoods.  By way of example, such conditions might include significant and recurring \nflooding, presence of hazardous waste sites or ongoing localized emissions not under appropriate \nremediation, nearby heavy industrial, uses or uses presenting significant safety or noise concerns \nsuch as major thoroughfares, nearby active railways (other than commuter trains), or landing \nstrips; significant and widespread (i.e., not localized to a small number of businesses or other \nbuildings)  rodent  or  vermin  infestation  acknowledged  to  present  health  risks  requiring  a \nconcerted effort; or fire hazards; \nB.  presence of blighted structures; \nC.  presence of inadequate transportation; \nD.  lack of accessibility to and/or presence of inadequate health care facilities, law \nenforcement  and  fire  fighting  facilities,  social  and  recreational  facilities,  and  other  public \nfacilities  comparable  to  those  typically  found  in  neighborhoods  containing  comparable  but \nunassisted housing;  \nE.  the presence of significant crime. \nF.  the presence, condition, and performance of public education; or  \nG.  the presence of local business providing employment opportunities.  \nH.  A municipality is not required to identify and address all such factors, but it \nmust set forth in its plan those factors that it has identified and determined it will address.   \nc.  The adopting municipality or county must have based its plan on the findings of \nthe foregoing assessment and must have afforded the public opportunity to provide input and \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 16 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 22 of 29   PageID 7542\ncomment on the proposed plan and the factors that it would address.  To the extent that issues \nidentified require coordination with other authorities, jurisdictions, or the like, such as school \nboards or hospitals, the adopting municipality should include coordination with such bodies in its \nplan and, to the extent feasible, secure their cooperation.   \nd.  The adopted plan, taken as a whole, must be a plan that can reasonably be \nexpected to revitalize the community and address in a substantive and meaningful way the \nmaterial factors identified.  The adopted plan must specifically address how the providing of \naffordable rental housing fits into the overall plan and is a necessary component thereof.   \ne.  The  adopted  plan  must  describe  the  planned  sources  and  uses  of  funds  to \naccomplish its purposes.   \nf.  For any application located in a qualified census tract at the time of application to \nbe eligible for enhanced points for this item based on its location, the revitalization plan must \nalready be in place as evidenced by as certification that:  \nA.  the  plan  was  duly  adopted  with  the  required  public  comment  processes \nfollowed;   \nB.  that funding and activity under the plan have already commenced; and  \nC.  the adopting municipality or county has no reason to believe that the overall \nfunding for the full and timely implementation of the plan will  be unavailable.   \nAt the time of any award of Low Income Housing Tax Credits the site and neighborhood \nof  any  unit  covered  by  the  award  and  must  conform  to  the  Department’s  rules  regarding \nunacceptable sites. \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 17 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 23 of 29   PageID 7543\nIt is recognized that municipalities and counties will need to devote time and effort to \nadopt a concerted revitalization plan that complies with the requirements of this remedial plan.  \nTherefore, for purposes of the first cycle of Low Income Housing Tax Credit awards following \nthe issuance of an Order adopting a remedial plan, the The Board of the Department may, in a \npublic meeting, determine that a revitalization plan substantively and meaningfully satisfies a \nrevitalization effort, notwithstanding one or more of the above factors not having been satisfied. \n7.  Promulgation of fair housing choice disclosure. \nThe Department will promulgate by rule a fair housing choice disclosure in a form \nsubstantially equivalent to that set out in Attachment A, advising prospective tenants in writing \nof a website or other method of contact where they can obtain information about alternative \nhousing and their rights under fair housing laws.  The Department will maintain a website \nproviding relevant information and identifying tax credit assisted properties searchable by ZIP \ncode, city, and/or county. The Department will require that no initial lease be entered into for a \nunit assisted with low income housing tax credits unless that disclosure has first been provided to \nthe prospective tenant.  \n8.  Annual  analysis  of  effectiveness  of  plan  and  continued  development  and \nenhancement of a policy of avoidance of over-concentration of low income housing units.  \nThe Department will annually conduct an analysis of the effects of its prior QAP to \ndetermine if that QAP was contributing to disparate impact; and will take appropriate and \nlawfully permitted measures to amend the next and subsequent QAPs (beginning with its 2013 \nQAP), to avoid present or potentially developing disparate impact in the allocation of low \nincome housing tax credits.  \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 18 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 24 of 29   PageID 7544\nAs each QAP is developed, the Department will analyze the distribution achieved under \nthe previous QAP.  It will take that analysis into account and use it to develop  (within the \nmeasures available to the Department under applicable law) changes in the incentives, threshold \nrequirements,  and  other  factors  to  address  any  potential  disparate  impact  and  to  achieve, \nprospectively, a broad and race neutral dispersion of low income housing tax credit assisted \nproperties.   \nThe QAP disparate impact analysis the Department performs will be made public.  The \npublic will be given opportunity to comment on the analysis, and the development of QAPs will \nalso be carried out in a public meeting or hearing with opportunity for review and comment by \nthe public, including the Plaintiff.  In order to achieve consistency on a statewide basis, the \nDepartment will endeavor to apply the principles and objectives in this Plan on a statewide basis.  \n9.  Review of challenged public input.  \nAny public comment that will be considered for negative scoring of applications, or as \nopposition to 4% non-competitive allocations, may be challenged if it is contrary to findings or \ndeterminations, including zoning determinations, of a municipality, county, school district, or \nother local governmental entity.  If any such comment is challenged, the party that made the \nchallenge will have to declare the basis for the challenge.  The party that made the comment will \nbe given seven (7) days to provide any support for the accuracy of its assertions.  All such \nmaterials and the analysis of the Department’s staff will be provided to a fact finder for a review \nand determination.  The Department’s determination will be final. \nAdditionally, applications in HOAs that receive statements of neutrality or support from a \nNeighborhood Organization that had provided a statement of opposition against a tax credit \ndevelopment in the last three years and for which the prior application was assigned the point \n \nDEFENDANTS’ PROPOSED REMEDIAL PLAN – PAGE 19 of 24 \n1070764.1     \n \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00546-D   Document 194   Filed 08/07/12    Page 25 of 29   PageID 7545\nvalue associated with opposition, will receive an additional two (2) points. The Department will \namend its debarment rules to provide that if an applicant is found to have worked to create \nopposition to their own or another’s application in any application round, they shall be subject to \ndebarment.  An applicant against whom debarment proceedings have been initiated in good faith \nby the Department shall not be eligible for these points.   \n10. Tie breakers. \nIn the event of a tie in scoring, the tie breaker will be a preference for the developments \nthat are located the greatest distance from the nearest development that is assisted by either 4% \nor 9% credits.  \n11. Transparency and openness of process.  \nThe Department will continue to make available on its website proposed and final QAPs \nwith comments and responses, applications, underwriting reports, application and award logs, \nscoring logs by subject, inventories, and appeal materials. Additionally, the Department will \nbeginning with the 2013 competitive tax credit cycle, post market studies, Phase I Environmental \nSite Assessments and property condition assessments on its website.  Nothing will require the \ndisclosure of any item which has been found to be confidential as a matter of law.   \n12. Plan subject to statutory constraints.  \nThis Plan acknowledges that as the Department considers and takes actions within its \nlawful powers, the implementation of such matters is an inherently deliberate and public process \nthat takes time.  Factors which must be addressed include adherence to the Texas Administrative \nProcedures Act; the Texas General Appropriations Act; Chapter 2306 of the Texas Government \nCode;  and  adherence  to  various  federal  requirements  regarding  the  administration  of  other \nsources of funding impacting the Department’s ability to address such matters.

(“FRI”) moves to intervene in this action as of right or\npermissively.  For the reasons that follow, the court grants the motion.  \nI\nThis action is the subject of two prior opinions;1 therefore, the background facts and\nprocedural history need not be discussed at length.  On March 20, 2012 the court found in\nfavor of plaintiff The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (“ICP”) on its disparate impact\nclaim under §§ 3604(a) and 3605(a) of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”).  See Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, ___ F.Supp.2d ____, 2012 WL 953696,\nat *1 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 20, 2012) (Fitzwater, C.J.).  The court directed that defendant Texas\n1See Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, ___\nF.Supp.2d ____, 2012 WL 953696 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 20, 2012) (Fitzwater, C.J.); Inclusive\nCmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 749 F.Supp.2d 486 (N.D. Tex.\n2010) (Fitzwater, C.J.).\n\nDepartment of Housing and Community Affairs (“TDHCA”) submit a remedial plan, and it\npermitted ICP to present objections to TDHCA’s proposal.  See id. at *13.  On April 30,\n2012, before TDHCA filed the remedial plan, FRI filed the instant motion to intervene under\nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) and (b)(2).  FRI seeks intervention to assist in developing a remedy\nfor the FHA violation and, if necessary, to assert objections and pursue an appeal of the\ncourt-ordered remedy.  ICP opposes FRI’s motion.  The court concludes that FRI has\nestablished that it is entitled to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)(2).2  \nII\nA party is entitled to an intervention of right under Rule 24(a)(2) if (1) the motion to\nintervene is timely, (2) the interest asserted by the potential intervenor is related to the action,\n(3) that interest may be impaired or impeded by the action, and (4) that interest is not\nadequately represented by the existing parties.  See, e.g., In re Lease Oil Antitrust Litig., 570\nF.3d 244, 247 (5th Cir. 2009); Sierra Club v. Espy, 18 F.3d 1202, 1204-05 (5th Cir. 1994)\n(citing New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 732 F2d 452, 463 (5th Cir.\n1984) (en banc)).  \n2Because the court holds that FRI is entitled to intervene as of right, it need not reach\nthe question whether FRI should be allowed to intervene permissively under Rule 24(b)(2).\n- 2 -\n\nIII\nThe first element—timeliness—is determined by examining (1) the length of time\nbetween the potential intervenor’s learning that its interest is no longer protected by the\nexisting parties and its motion to intervene, (2) the extent of prejudice to the existing parties\nfrom allowing late intervention, (3) the extent of prejudice to the potential intervenor if the\nmotion is denied, and (4) any unusual circumstances.  See, e.g., Lease Oil Antitrust Litig.,\n570 F.3d at 247-48. \nA\nRegarding the first element, although ICP asserts that FRI should have learned of this\nlawsuit  based  on  publicity  that  commenced  in  2008  and  from  TDHCA  reports  and\ndocuments, the first element of timeliness focuses on when the intervenor “became aware\nthat its interests would no longer be protected by the original parties,” not “the date on which\nthe would-be intervenor became aware of the pendency of the action.”  Sierra Club, 18 F.3d\nat 1206 (citing Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 264 (5th Cir. 1977)).  The earliest\nFRI could have learned that its interest was no longer protected by TDHCA was on March\n20, 2012, when the court issued its decision and TDHCA transitioned from defending its\nallocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (“LIHTC”) to presenting a remedial plan to\naddress the disparate impact violation of the FHA: a plan that could impair LIHTC\napplications by FRI.  See Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 2012 WL 953696, at *13.  FRI moved\nto intervene 41 days later, which is not unreasonable.  Cf. Edwards v. City of Hous., 78 F.3d\n983, 1000-01 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (collecting cases in support of proposition that delays\n- 3 -\n\nof 37 and 47 days were not unreasonable).  \nB\nConcerning the second element—the extent of prejudice to the existing parties from\nallowing late intervention—the court holds that the existing parties will not suffer prejudice\non this basis.  TDHCA does not oppose FRI’s intervention, and ICP does not present any\nmeritorious grounds for finding prejudice.  FRI moved to intervene soon after it became\naware that its interest was no longer protected and before TDHCA filed its remedial plan.\nCf. John Doe # 1 v. Glickman, 256 F.3d 371, 378 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding no prejudice under\nthis element because potential intervenor filed motion approximately one month after it\nbecame aware of stake, which was before trial and final judgment).  And while ICP asserts\nthat FRI is attempting to relitigate issues decided at trial, “no prejudice can come from [this]\nbecause an [intervenor] must accept the proceedings as [it] finds them.”  Id. (quoting Sierra\nClub, 18 F.3d at 1206 n.3) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nC\nAs to the third element—the extent of prejudice to the potential intervenor if the\nmotion is denied—the court concludes that FRI will incur prejudice if intervention is denied.\nAs a nonparty, FRI will be affected by the court-ordered remedy when TDHCA implements\nit against LIHTC applicants, but FRI will not be able to participate in developing the remedy\nor to appeal the ruling.  See id. at 379 (citing Edwards, 78 F.3d at 1002-03); see also Lease\nOil Antitrust Litig., 570 F.3d at 249-50 (“Intervening in the existing federal lawsuit is the\nmost efficient, and most certain, way for [the potential intervenor] to pursue its claim.”).  \n- 4 -\n\nD\nThe fourth element of timeliness—the presence of any unusual circumstances—does\nnot warrant denying FRI’s motion.\nIV\nThe second element for assessing a motion to intervene as of right considers whether\nthe interest asserted by FRI is related to this lawsuit.\nFRI has a direct, substantial, legally protectable interest in the subject of this action,\nwhich involves the allocation of LIHTC.  FRI is authorized to apply for LIHTC from\nTDHCA.  Cf. Edwards, 78 F.3d at 1004 (holding that potential interference with promotion\nopportunities could justify intervention, and that vested interest in promotion was not\nrequired) (quoting Black Fire Fighters Ass’n of Dall. v. City of Dall., Tex., 19 F.3d 992, 994\n(5th Cir. 1994); Howard v. McLucas, 782 F.2d 956, 959 (11th Cir. 1986)); Sierra Club, 18\nF.3d at 1207 (“[T]he ‘interest’ test is primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by\ninvolving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due\nprocess[.]”) (quoting Ceres Gulf v. Cooper, 957 F.2d 1199, 1203 n.10 (5th Cir. 1992)).  \n- 5 -\n\nV\nThe third factor assesses whether FRI’s interest may be impaired or impeded by the\naction.\nFRI’s interest may be impaired by this lawsuit because, if FRI is denied leave to\nintervene, it will be bound by the court-ordered remedy once TDHCA implements it, and this\nmay impair FRI’s ability to obtain LIHTC for its projects.  See, e.g., Edwards, 78 F.3d at\n1005; Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1207.  Although ICP contends that FRI is not impacted because\nFRI’s 2012 LIHTC application will likely receive an award, FRI’s interest is considerably\nbroader than a single application in a single application cycle; FRI seeks a court-ordered\nremedy that will not unnecessarily hinder the award of LIHTC to developments that\nrevitalize low-income areas, even if located in predominately minority areas.\nVI\nThe fourth element evaluates whether FRI’s interest is adequately represented by the\nexisting parties.  Contrary to ICP’s contentions, FRI is not adequately represented by the\nexisting parties.  TDHCA is a governmental agency that must represent the general public\ninterest, not the private interests of FRI.  See John Doe #1, 256 F.3d at 381.  And, as ICP and\nFRI recognize, they are asserting competing claims to the distribution of LIHTC. \n- 6 -\n\n*     *     *\nAccordingly, for the reasons explained, the court grants FRI’s April 30, 2012 motion\nto intervene. \nSO ORDERED. \nJune 12, 2012.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.

(“ICP”) has proved a prima facie case and may therefore proceed to the next sequential\nstep of its disparate impact claim under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq.\n(“FHA”).  For the reasons that follow,1 the court finds that ICP has not proved a prima facie\n1Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(1), the court sets out its findings of fact and\nconclusions  of  law  in  this  memorandum  opinion.    Although  the  court  has  carefully\nconsidered the record, this memorandum opinion has been written to comply with the level\nof detail required in this circuit for findings of fact and conclusions of law.  See, e.g., Century\nMarine Inc. v. United States, 153 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir. 1998) (discussing standards).  The\ncourt has not set out its findings and conclusions in punctilious detail, slavishly traced the\nclaims issue by issue and witness by witness, or indulged in exegetics, parsing or declaiming\nevery fact and each nuance and hypothesis.  It has instead written a memorandum opinion\nthat contains findings and conclusions that provide a clear understanding of the basis for the\ncourt’s decision.  See id.\n\ncase, and it dismisses ICP’s disparate impact claim.\nI\nThis is an action by ICP against defendants Texas Department of Housing and\nCommunity Affairs and its Executive Director and board members in their official capacities\n(collectively, “TDHCA”) challenging TDHCA’s allocation of Low Income Housing Tax\nCredits (“LIHTC”) in the Dallas metropolitan area.2  ICP sought relief for intentional\ndiscrimination based on race, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth\nAmendment (actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) and 42 U.S.C. § 1982.  Inclusive Cmtys.\nProject, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 860 F.Supp.2d 312, 313 (N.D. Tex.\n2012) (Fitzwater, C.J.) (“ICP III”), rev’d, 747 F.3d 275 (5th Cir. 2014), aff’d and remanded,\n___ U.S. ___, 135 S.Ct. 2507 (2015).  ICP also alleged that TDHCA was liable under §§\n3604(a) and 3605(a) of the FHA on a disparate impact theory.  Id.  Following the entry of\npartial summary judgment in ICP’s favor, and a bench trial, the court found in favor of ICP\non its FHA-based disparate impact claim and against ICP on all other claims.  Id. at 314.\nAt the time the court first decided this case on the merits, the Fifth Circuit had not\n“determined  the  legal  standards  that  should  be  applied  in  disparate  impact  housing\ndiscrimination cases.”  Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs,\n747 F.3d 275, 280-81 (5th Cir. 2014) (“ICP V”), aff’d and remanded, ___ U.S. ___, 135\nS.Ct. 2507 (2015).  Absent controlling precedent from the Supreme Court or the Fifth\n2Intervenor Frazier Revitalization Inc.—who is aligned with TDHCA—has obtained\nleave to intervene.\n- 2 -\n\nCircuit, this court essentially followed the approach of the Second Circuit in Huntington\nBranch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 939 (2d Cir.), aff’d in part, 488 U.S.\n15  (1988),  but  without  engaging  in  a  process  of  balancing  the  factors  identified  in\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283\n(7th Cir. 1977).  ICP III, 860 F.Supp.2d at 322 n.17.  Before trial, the court granted partial\nsummary judgment holding that ICP had made a prima facie showing that TDHCA had\nviolated the FHA based on ICP’s disparate impact theory.  Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v.\nTex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 749 F.Supp.2d 486, 499-500 (N.D. Tex. 2010)\n(Fitzwater, C.J.) (“ICP II”).  At trial, the court decided ICP’s disparate impact claim on the\nmerits using as a starting point its summary judgment ruling that ICP had established a prima\nfacie case. \nIn ICP II the court held that ICP was entitled to summary\njudgment establishing that it had made a prima facie showing of\ndisparate impact. . . .  Because ICP has made this showing, the\nburden has shifted to defendants to prove by a preponderance of\nthe  evidence  that  their  actions  were  in  furtherance  of  a\nlegitimate governmental interest.\nICP III, 860 F.Supp.2d at 322.  But as the court explains below, the court’s conclusion that\nICP had established a prima facie case beyond peradventure was reached without the benefit\nof the Supreme Court’s decision in this case, and rested on understandings such as that\nTDHCA “essentially [did] not contest ICP’s prima facie cases,” ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at\n498, that “ICP’s prima facie burden [was] not a heavy one,” id. at 499, and that “ICP ha[d]\nadduced evidence that [was] uncontested,” id. at 500. \n- 3 -\n\nOn appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded.  ICP V, 747 F.3d 275.  It held that\nthis court had “correctly noted [that a] violation of the FHA can be shown either by proof of\nintentional discrimination or by proof of disparate impact.”  Id. at 280.  But the Fifth Circuit\nalso noted that it had “not previously determined the legal standards that should be applied\nin disparate impact housing discrimination cases,” id. at 280-81; that other circuits “have\napplied multiple different legal standards to similar claims under the FHA,” id. at 281; and\nthat “after [this] court’s decision in this case, [the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (“HUD”)] issued regulations regarding disparate impact claims under the\nFHA,” id. at 282.  The panel adopted the burden-shifting approach of the new HUD\nregulations for disparate impact claims brought under the FHA, id. at 282, and it remanded\nthe case for this court “to apply this legal standard to the facts in the first instance,” id. at\n283.3\nThe Supreme Court then granted certiorari to decide whether disparate impact claims\nare cognizable under the FHA.  Affirming the judgment of the Fifth Circuit, the Supreme\nCourt held that disparate impact claims are cognizable.  Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs\nv. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 135 S.Ct. 2507 (2015) (“ICP VI”).  Following\nthe Supreme Court’s remand to the Fifth Circuit, the panel then “remand[ed] this case . . . for\nfurther proceeding consistent with [its] opinion and the opinion of the Supreme Court.” \n3The Fifth Circuit made clear that it was not requiring that this court “must retry the\ncase,” and that it was leaving “it to the sound discretion of [this] court to decide whether any\nadditional proceedings are necessary or appropriate.” ICP V, 747 F.3d at 283.  \n- 4 -\n\nInclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 795 F.3d 509 (5th Cir.\n2015) (per curiam).\nThis court, in turn, requested that the parties propose how the case should proceed on\nremand.  Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 2015 WL\n5916220, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 8, 2015) (Fitzwater, J.).  ICP maintained that the briefing\nshould commence at step two of the three-part burden-shifting approach—that TDHCA4\nshould be required to address the justification element, followed by ICP’s addressing the less\ndiscriminatory alternative element.  Id. at *3.  ICP “posit[ed] that the court should adhere to\nits summary judgment decision that ICP ha[d] established the first element (prima facie\ncase).”  Id.  TDHCA and intervenor Frazier Revitalization Inc. contended that “the court\nshould reconsider whether ICP ha[d] pleaded and proved a prima facie case,” and that\n“TDHCA should not be required to address the justification prong unless ICP meets its\nobligation to plead and prove a prima facie case.”  Id.\nThe court concluded “that the interests of justice and fundamental fairness require[d]\nthat [the court] first consider on the current (or a supplemented) trial record whether ICP\nha[d] established a prima facie case.”  Id.  This was so because, although the court had\ngranted partial summary judgment in ICP II holding that ICP had established a prima facie\ncase on its disparate impact claim, it had done so without the benefit of the Supreme Court’s\nopinion; it had not given the prima facie requirement the same emphasis that the Supreme\n4The court uses TDHCA to refer to defendants collectively.  ICP actually referred to\ndefendants.\n- 5 -\n\nCourt had given it—for example, the court had stated that ICP’s prima facie burden was not\na heavy one, and it had concluded that ICP need only provide evidence that raised an\ninference of discrimination; and the court arguably had “not analyze[d] ICP’s evidence\nthrough the prism of the ‘robust causality requirement’ envisioned by the Supreme Court.” \nId.  \nThe court also reasoned that TDHCA had not had the benefit of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision, and, therefore, “a pellucid sense of its importance in the equation of proving FHA\ndisparate impact liability.”  Id. at *4.  In ICP II the court pointed out that, in opposing ICP’s\nsummary judgment motion, defendants essentially had not contested ICP’s prima facie cases,\nand ICP had established a prima facie case based on evidence that was “uncontested.”  Id.\n(quoting ICP II, 749 F.Supp.2d at 500).  The court reasoned that TDHCA should therefore\nbe permitted to challenge ICP’s prima facie showing “based on a clearer understanding of\nthe requirements and consequences of ICP’s establishing a prima facie case.”  Id.\nFinally, the court concluded:\ngiven the significant developments in this case on appeal, . . .\nthe interests of justice and fundamental fairness require not only\nthat ICP’s disparate impact claim be decided anew under the\nburden-shifting regimen adopted by HUD and the Fifth Circuit,\nbut that the court start with whether ICP has established a prima\nfacie case. \nId.  \nThe parties have submitted their prima facie case briefing and have supplemented the\nrecord, and the court has heard oral argument.\n- 6 -\n\nII\nICP is a non-profit organization that seeks racial and socioeconomic integration in the\nDallas metropolitan area.  To that end, ICP assists low-income, predominantly African-\nAmerican families who are eligible for the Dallas Housing Authority’s Section 8 Housing\nChoice Voucher program (“Section 8”) in finding affordable housing in predominately\nCaucasian, suburban neighborhoods.  Because under the LIHTC program a development that\nreceives tax credits cannot refuse housing solely because a person is using a Section 8\nvoucher, it is important to ICP where the developments are located in the Dallas metropolitan\narea. \nUnder § 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (“I.R.C.”), the government provides tax\ncredits (here, LIHTC) that a state (here, Texas) distributes to developers through a designated\nstate agency (here, TDHCA).  See Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.053(b)(10) (West 2008). \nDevelopers apply to TDHCA for tax credits, which can be sold to finance construction of a\nhousing project.  ICP alleges that TDHCA’s allocation of LIHTC in the Dallas metropolitan\narea has a disparate impact on the location of low-income housing in the area.  ICP\ncomplains of TDHCA’s allocation of two different types of tax credits: the 4% credit, and\nthe 9% credit. \nNine  percent  tax  credits  are  distributed  on  an  annual  cycle  and  are  generally\noversubscribed.  Certain federal and state laws dictate, at least in part, how TDHCA selects\napplications for 9% tax credits.  First, I.R.C. § 42 requires that the designated state agency\nadopt a “Qualified Allocation Plan” (“QAP”) that prescribes the “selection criteria” for 9%\n- 7 -\n\ntax credits.  Id. at § 42(m)(1)(A)-(B).  The QAP must include, inter alia, certain criteria and\npreferences; otherwise, zero housing credit dollars will be provided.  § 42(m)(1)(A)-(C). \nSecond, the Texas Government Code regulates how TDHCA administers the LIHTC\nprogram: it requires that TDHCA adopt annually a QAP and corresponding manual, id. at\n§ 2306.67022, and sets out how TDHCA should evaluate applications, id. at § 2306.6710(a). \nFirst, TDHCA must “determine whether the application satisfies the threshold criteria” in the\nQAP.  Id. at § 2306.6710(a).  Applications satisfying the “threshold criteria” are then\n“score[d] and rank[ed]” by a point system that “prioritizes in descending order” ten listed\nstatutory criteria (also called “above-the-line criteria”), which directly affects TDHCA’s\ndiscretion in creating “selection criteria” in each QAP.  Id. at § 2306.6710(b).  TDHCA is\nalso permitted to consider other criteria and preferences (also called “below-the-line”\ncriteria), but it “lacks discretionary authority to intersperse other factors into the ranking\nsystem that will have greater points than” the statutory criteria.  Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. No. GA-\n0208, 2004 WL 1434796, at *6 (2004).  \nOnce the TDHCA adopts a QAP, it submits it to the Governor, who can “approve,\nreject, or modify and approve” it.  Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2306.6724(b)-(c) (West 2001). \nThe TDHCA staff then review applications, underwrite applications to determine their\nfinancial feasibility and appropriate level of tax credits, and submit recommendations to the\nTDHCA. § 2306.6710(b)(1)(A) & (d), § 2306.6724(e).  The TDHCA reviews the staff\nrecommendations and issues final commitments in accordance with the QAP.  Id. at §\n2306.6724(e)-(f).  \n- 8 -\n\nUnlike 9% tax credits, 4% tax credits are awarded according to non-competitive\ncriteria, available to applicants on a year-round basis, and generally are not oversubscribed. \nIn awarding a 4% tax credit, the TDHCA “reviews the application for threshold, eligibility\nand then the development is underwritten.”  P. Ex. 1 at 20; see also Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.\n§ 2306.67021 (West 2001).  Applications for the 4% tax credit are not subject to scoring\nunder the selection criteria and are not decided under a competitive scoring model.\nIII\nThe Supreme Court held in ICP VI that disparate impact claims are cognizable under\nthe FHA.  ICP VI, 135 S. Ct. at 2514-15.  The Court did not disturb the Fifth Circuit’s\nadoption of the HUD burden-shifting regimen, but it prescribed several limitations on\ndisparate impact liability, and it questioned whether ICP can prove liability in this case.  The\nCourt cautioned that disparate impact liability should not be established “based solely on a\nshowing of statistical disparity,” id. at 2522; and that it properly results in the removal of\n“artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers,” but does not eschew “valid governmental\npolicies,” id. \nAs a result of the Fifth Circuit’s decision adopting the HUD regulations, and the\nSupreme Court’s affirmance (without altering the burden-shifting approach), the following\nproof regimen now applies to ICP’s disparate impact claim under the FHA:  \n- 9 -\n\nWe now adopt the burden-shifting approach found in 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.500 for claims of disparate impact under the FHA. See 24\nC.F.R. § 100.500.  First, a plaintiff must prove a prima facie\ncase of discrimination by showing that a challenged practice\ncauses  a  discriminatory  effect,  as  defined  by  24  C.F.R.  §\n100.500(a). 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(1).  If the plaintiff makes a\nprima  facie  case,  the  defendant  must  then  prove  “that  the\nchallenged  practice  is  necessary  to  achieve  one  or  more\nsubstantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests . . . .”  Id. §\n100.500(c)(2).  If the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff\nmust then show that the defendant’s interests “could be served\nby another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.”  Id. §\n100.500(c)(3).\nICP V, 747 F.3d at 282.\nIn the first step of proving its prima facie case, ICP must “point to [TDHCA’s] policy\nor policies causing that [statistical] disparity.”  ICP VI, 135 S.Ct. at 2523.  “[A] one-time\n[housing] decision may not be a policy at all.”  Id. at 2523.  Importantly, “‘racial imbalance\n. . . does not, without more, establish a prima facie case of disparate impact.’”  Id. (quoting\nWards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 653 (1989)).  This “robust causality\nrequirement . . . protects defendants from being held liable for racial disparities they did not\ncreate.”  Id.  The Court noted that, in cases such as this one, “it may also be difficult to\nestablish causation because of the multiple factors that go into investment decisions about\nwhere to construct or renovate housing units.”  Id. at 2523-24.  Accordingly, this court must\n“examine with care whether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of disparate impact,\nand prompt resolution of these cases is important.”  Id. at 2523.  \n“A plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or produce statistical\nevidence demonstrating a causal connection cannot make out a prima facie case of disparate\n- 10 -\n\nimpact.”  Id.  The Court specifically noted Judge Jones’s specially concurring opinion in ICP\nV, in which she observed that “if the ICP cannot show a causal connection between the\nDepartment’s policy and a disparate impact—for instance, because federal law substantially\nlimits the Department’s discretion—that should result in dismissal of this case.”  Id. at 2524\n(citing ICP V, 747 F.3d at 283-84).  The Court cautioned that, “[u]nlike the heartland of\ndisparate-impact suits targeting artificial barriers to housing, the underlying dispute in this\ncase involves a novel theory of liability,” id. at 2522, and that “[t]his case, on remand, may\nbe seen simply as an attempt to second-guess which of two reasonable approaches a housing\nauthority should follow in the sound exercise of its discretion in allocating tax credits for\nlow-income housing.”  Id. at 2523.\nIV\nThe heart of ICP’s complaint is the allocation of 9% tax credits for low-income\nhousing developments.5  ICP alleges that the policy or practice of permitting the TDHCA to\nuse its discretion in allocating 9% tax credits perpetuates racial segregation, in violation of\nthe FHA.  ICP complains of the TDHCA’s exercise of discretion on the whole and in specific\nways.  Because ICP must identify a specific policy or practice that causes a statistically\nsignificant disparity in the location of low-income housing, see ICP VI, 135 S. Ct. 2507, the\ncourt will separately address ICP’s challenges to TDHCA’s discretion on the whole and in\n5The court addresses ICP’s challenges to the 4% program and the 9% program\nseparately because the allocation of each type of credits is done separately and the programs\nare administered in different ways.  \n- 11 -\n\nspecific contexts.  \nA\nThe court first decides whether TDHCA’s exercise of discretion in deciding how to\nallocate 9% tax credits is a specific, facially neutral policy sufficient to establish a prima\nfacie case of disparate impact liability.\n1\nICP alleges that the exercise of TDHCA’s discretion in the 9% tax credit program has\ncaused the exclusion of all but 6% of the LIHTC units from Caucasian areas in the City of\nDallas and all but 26% of the LIHTC units from Caucasian areas in the Dallas metropolitan\narea.  Between 1999 and 2008, applications for 9% tax credits for units located in minority\ntracts had a 41% approval rate, while applications for units located in Caucasian tracts had\na 21% approval rate.  As evidence of disparate impact, ICP points to TDHCA’s decisions to\ndeny or approve applications for specific applications for 9% tax credits between 1999 and\n2008.  ICP alleges that the use of TDHCA discretion in the aggregate resulted in an approval\nrate for units located in Caucasian areas of nearly half the approval rate for units located in\nminority areas.\nTDHCA responds that ICP has not identified a specific, facially-neutral policy that\ncaused a racially disparate impact sufficient to establish a prima facie case under the FHA.\nIt argues that discretion itself is not a policy; ICP has not accounted for the actions, policies,\nor preferences of third parties—such as Congress, the Texas Legislature, developers, and\nlocal communities—that impact the location of LIHTC units;  ICP relies on several specific\n- 12 -\n\nexercises of discretion—such as the use of set-asides for elderly units—but does not allege\nany facts demonstrating a statistical disparity caused by that use of discretion; and ICP\nchallenges statewide policies but claims only localized statistical disparity.  TDHCA also\nmaintains that ICP is not actually challenging TDHCA’s use of discretion; rather, ICP is\nseeking to require TDHCA to use its discretion in a specific way, that is, to provide\ndesegregated housing opportunities for ICP’s clients and to remedy historical housing\nsegregation.   \nICP replies that discretion can be a policy sufficient to state a disparate impact claim,\nand that federal laws establishing a preference for providing low-income housing in minority\nareas did not cause the statistical disparity in low-income housing.\n2\nTo prove a disparate impact claim, the plaintiff must first identify a facially-neutral\npolicy that has resulted in the disparate impact.  See ICP VI, 135 S.Ct. at 2522-24; see also\nCity of Miami v. Bank of Am. Corp., 2016 WL 1072488, at *4-5 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 17, 2016)\n(applying ICP VI).6  As the Supreme Court explained, disparate impact claims seek to\nremove impermissible barriers; therefore, ICP must identify a specific policy that has created\nbarriers to fair housing.  See City of Los Angeles v. Wells Fargo & Co., 2015 WL 4398858,\nat *8 (C.D. Cal. July 17, 2015) (applying ICP VI).  ICP must affirmatively identify a specific\n6As the Supreme Court explained, disparate impact cases “interpreting Title VII and\nthe ADEA provide essential background and instruction” in this case.  ICP VI, 135 S.Ct. at\n2518.  \n- 13 -\n\npolicy that produced a disparate impact, rather than point to a lack of policy that caused it. \nSee id.  Nor is it sufficient for ICP to point to a generalized policy that leads to a disparate\nimpact.  Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 554 U.S. 84, 100 (2008) (quoting Smith v.\nCity of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 241 (2005)).  This is not a “trivial burden.”  Id.  \nThe offending policy or practice must be specifically identified for at least two\nreasons.  First, the court cannot evaluate whether the offending policy caused a statistically\nsignificant disparity without knowing the offending policy with precision.  Meacham, 554\nU.S. at 100 (explaining that plaintiff must specifically identify the offending policy so that\nthe court can ensure that employers are not liable for “the myriad of innocent causes that may\nlead to statistical imbalances.”); Hanrahan v. Blank Rome LLP, 142 F.Supp.3d 349, 354\n(E.D. Pa. 2015) (dismissing disparate impact claim where plaintiff failed to identify and\nisolate a specific employment policy).  Especially where the defendant has combined\ndiscretionary or subjective decision-making with objective criteria, “the plaintiff is in our\nview responsible for isolating and identifying the specific . . . practices that are allegedly\nresponsible for any observed statistical disparities.”  Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 656; see also\nAnderson v. Douglas & Lomason Co., 26 F.3d 1277, 1283-85 (5th Cir. 1994).  If the plaintiff\ndoes not identify a specific policy or practice, the court cannot determine whether that policy\nor practice has created a barrier to fair housing or has resulted in a statistical disparity.  See\nWells Fargo, 2015 WL 4398858, at *8 (citing ICP VI, 135 S.Ct. at 2523).  In Anderson, an\nemployment discrimination case, the plaintiff asserted that the cumulative effects of the\ndefendant’s employment practices caused a racial disparity in promotions.  Anderson, 26\n- 14 -\n\nF.3d at 1284.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff’s disparate treatment\nimpact claim and noted that the plaintiff had failed to identify a specific policy that caused\nthe racial disparity.  Id.\nLikewise, ICP has failed to point to a specific, facially neutral policy that purportedly\ncaused a racially disparate impact.  By relying simply on TDHCA’s exercise of discretion\nin awarding tax credits, ICP has not isolated and identified the specific practice that caused\nthe disparity in the location of low-income housing.  Like the plaintiff in Anderson, ICP has\npointed to the “cumulative effects” of TDHCA’s decision-making process over a multi-year\nperiod.  ICP cannot rely on this generalized policy of discretion to prove disparate impact.\nIdentification of a specific policy or practice is also essential for determining how to\nremedy the disparate impact.  Although the court need not now decide what remedy, if any,\nis required in this case, consideration of the potential remedies for disparate impact claims\ndemonstrates what kinds of policies are offending.  The Supreme Court requires that\n“[r]emedial orders in disparate-impact cases . . . concentrate on the elimination of the\noffending practice, and courts should strive to design race-neutral remedies.”  ICP VI, 135\nS.Ct. at 2512.  The Court cautioned that lower courts should be careful not to “impose racial\ntargets or quotas,” because doing so “might raise difficult constitutional questions.”  Id.  In\nsum, any remedy must focus on removing the offending practices and must be race-neutral. \nICP has not identified any offending policy for which there exists a constitutionally-\nsound remedy.  To remedy disparate impact, the court must craft a race-neutral remedy that\nremoves the offending practice.  For example, if ICP complained that TDHCA’s use of bonus\n- 15 -\n\npoints for certain types of housing developments had a disparate impact, the court could\norder a remedy that adjusted how the TDHCA awarded such bonus points.  Here, ICP has\nnot identified any barriers to housing that the court can remove.  Although ICP complains\nof TDHCA’s exercise of discretion in housing decisions, it does not ask the court to prohibit\nTDHCA from using its discretion; rather, it asks the court to require that TDHCA exercise\nits discretion in a specific way: to desegregate housing.  For example, ICP implies that\nTDHCA  should  be  required  to  award  bonus  points  for  developments  that  provide\nopportunities for desegregation and to subtract points for developments in areas of slum and\nblight.7  Because ICP has not sufficiently identified a specific, facially-neutral policy that has\ncaused a statistical disparity, the court cannot fashion a remedy that removes that policy.\nB\nICP’s disparate impact claim must be dismissed for an additional reason: regardless\nof the label ICP places on its claim, it is actually complaining about disparate treatment, not\ndisparate impact.8  The purpose of disparate impact liability is to root out a facially neutral\npolicy that has an unintended discriminatory result.  Phillips v. Cohen, 400 F.3d 388, 398\n(6th Cir. 2005) (citing Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 986 (1988)).  But\n7Additionally, in response to TDHCA’s proposed remedial plan, ICP argued that\nTDHCA “can and should use its discretion to remedy the violation” to “accomplish the\nremedial purpose of the plan.”  ICP 6/18/12 Resp. to Ds. Proposed Remedial Plan at 10.\n8ICP originally asserted claims for disparate treatment and disparate impact, both\nrooted in the TDHCA’s allocation of tax credits for low-income housing.  The court ruled\nagainst ICP on its disparate treatment claim.  ICP III, 860 F.Supp.2d at 314.  \n- 16 -\n\na claim for intentional discrimination is evaluated under the disparate treatment framework,\nwhich requires a showing of targeted discrimination.  Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 666.  Where\nthe plaintiff establishes that a subjective policy, such as the use of discretion, has been used\nto achieve a racial disparity, the plaintiff has shown disparate treatment.  See, e.g., Johnson\nv. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 2008 WL 3163531, at *4-6 (M.D. Tenn.\nAug. 4, 2008) (citing Phillips and Wards Cove).  On the other hand, where the plaintiff\nestablishes that the existence of the policy itself, rather than how the policy is applied,\nresulted in a racial disparity, the plaintiff has shown disparate impact.  Id.  \nThese examples are illustrative.  In Johnson the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant-\nemployer applied a promotion method that had an adverse effect on white male employees. \nId.    Rather  than  challenge  the  method  itself,  plaintiffs  challenged  the  results  of  the\nemployer’s application of the method to them, and argued that the method was used to avoid\npromoting white male employees.  Id.  The court held that plaintiffs’ claim was one for\ndisparate  treatment  because  they  argued  that  the  method  was  used  to  intentionally\ndiscriminate against them, even if they did not label their claim as such.  \nSimilarly, in Reminder v. Roadway Express, Inc., 215 Fed. Appx. 481 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(per curiam), the plaintiff asserted a disparate impact claim, arguing that his employer’s\nmethod of downsizing resulted in a disproportionate termination of employees over age 40. \nId.  at  485.    The  Sixth  Circuit  held  that  the  plaintiff  “clearly”  asserted  a  disparate\ntreatment—not disparate impact—claim despite its label because the plaintiff did not identify\na specific neutral policy but rather the impact of the downsizing methods that targeted\n- 17 -\n\npersons over age 40.  Id.  \nICP likewise complains of disparate treatment.  Although ICP labels its claim as one\nfor disparate impact, a fair reading of ICP’s arguments reveals that it is complaining about\nthe results of TDHCA’s discretion, not the existence of the discretion.  See, e.g., ICP 2/25/16\nPrima Facie Reply Br. at 10 (“This longstanding result [of TDHCA’s decisions] is consistent\nwith the use of a race based cap on the percentage of LIHTC family units to be allowed in\nCaucasian areas.”); at 15-16 (arguing that TDHCA’s stated reasons for its decisions are\npretextual).  If ICP were challenging the existence of TDHCA’s discretion rather than how\nthe discretion is used, ICP would seek to enjoin that discretion and to mandate a points-only\nsystem or another wholly objective method of awarding tax credits.  Instead, ICP maintains\nthat TDHCA’s exercise of discretion should be the means to achieve a specific end: to\nprovide increased opportunities for desegregated low-income housing.  Because ICP is\nactually complaining of the results of TDHCA’s exercise of discretion rather than of the\nexistence of that discretion, ICP has not established a claim for disparate impact.\nC\nEven assuming arguendo that TDHCA’s use of discretion is a specific, facially neutral\npolicy, ICP has not established that the exercise of that discretion caused the disparity in the\nlocation of low-income housing. \n1\n“A disparate-impact claim relying on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff\ncannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that disparity.”  ICP VI, 135 S.Ct. at\n- 18 -\n\n2523.  This causality requirement is “robust” to ensure that “defendants do not resort to the\nuse of racial quotas” to avoid liability for statistical disparities.  Id.  The plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that the statistical disparity is caused by the defendant’s policy or policies, rather\nthan by other factors.  Id. (citing CFR § 100.500(c)(1) (2014)).  Accordingly, to establish a\nprima facie case of disparate impact, ICP must prove facts that plausibly demonstrate a\ncausal link between the challenged policy or practice and a statistical disparity.  Id.; see also\nEllis v. City of Minneapolis, 2015 WL 5009341, at *10 (D. Minn. Aug. 24, 2015) (applying\nICP VI ).  The use of discretion “should itself raise no inference of discriminatory conduct.” \nJohnson v. Uncle Ben’s, Inc., 965 F.2d 1363, 1369 (5th Cir. 1992) (citing Watson, 487 U.S.\n989).    \n2\nICP has not proved that TDHCA’s policy of allowing discretion in allocating 9 % tax\ncredits caused a statistically-significant disparity.  ICP has established that (1) TDHCA has\ndiscretion in how it allocates 9% tax credits and (2) as of 2008, 26% of LIHTC units in the\nDallas metropolitan area are located in Caucasian areas and 74% are located in minority\nareas.  ICP has not proved that it was TDHCA’s exercise of discretion—and not something\nelse—that caused the difference in the number of LIHTC units in each area.  Put differently,\nICP has not demonstrated that, had TDHCA not been permitted to exercise any discretion\nwhen allocating 9% tax credits, and had those decisions been made strictly by the points\nsystem, there would be no, or significantly less, disparity in the location of LIHTC units.  \nNor has ICP proved what the distribution of LIHTC units or the percentages of\n- 19 -\n\napproved 9% applications would have been had TDHCA awarded credits based strictly on\npoints—had it exercised no discretion.  It is therefore possible that, based strictly on points,\nthe statistical disparity would be the same, lesser, or even greater.  For example, ICP adduced\nevidence  that,  in  1999,  TDHCA  awarded  credits  to  the  Rosemont  at  Arlington  Park\ndevelopment, a family development with 100 units in a predominately minority area of\nDallas, with 92 points.  ICP 1/7/16 Prima Facie Br. App. at 728.  The highest scoring\napplication in 1999, with 95 points, was the Columbia Valley Townhomes, a family\ndevelopment with 160 units in a predominately minority area of Dallas.  Id.  Accordingly,\nhad the TDHCA awarded credits based strictly on points, it would have created a greater\ndisparity in the number of LIHTC units in minority areas and in Caucasian areas: it would\nhave awarded credits to 160 units in a minority area instead of 100 units. In 2005, the\nTDHCA’s awards would have been the same had it awarded credits based solely on points. \nId. at 738.  And as TDHCA explained at oral argument, from 2004 to 2008, TDHCA\napproved 12 applications for tax credits for low-income housing in minority areas and 12\napplications for tax credits for low-income housing in Caucasian areas.\nNor has ICP accounted for other potential causes of the statistical disparity.  TDHCA\nargues that “ICP does not account for the actions, policies, or preferences of third parties like\nCongress, the Texas Legislature, developers, and local communities that impact the location\nof LIHTC units.”  Ds. 2/4/16 Prima Facie Resp. Br. at 19.  It points to other potential causes\nof the statistical disparity: the preference under federal law for placement of LIHTC\nproperties in low-income communities and the corresponding “basis boost” received by\n- 20 -\n\napplications for tax credits for developments in low-income communities; the preference\nunder state law for financial feasibility and community participation; developers’ decisions\nregarding the locations of housing projects; and the decisions and preferences of local\ngovernments regarding zoning and approval of specific projects.\nICP replies that the existing statistical disparity cannot be caused by the federal\npreference for placement of LIHTC properties in low-income communities because the\nstatistical  disparity  predated  the  federal  preference.    And  according  to  ICP,  “[t]he\nuncontested facts rule out the possibility that either third parties or other factors are causing\nthe perpetuation of segregation.”  ICP 2/25/16 Prima Facie Reply Br. at 18.  ICP offers the\nexample of two applications for 9% tax credits for housing projects in Caucasian tracts that\nwere eligible for credits but denied.  ICP reasons that, because these two projects were not\neligible for the federal “basis boost,” TDHCA’s exercise of discretion was the only cause for\nthe denial of the applications.\nICP  has  not  proved  that  TDHCA’s  exercise  of  discretion—and  not  other\nfactors—caused the statistical disparity.  The Supreme Court recognized in ICP VI “[i]t may\nbe difficult [for ICP] to establish causation because of the multiple factors that go into\ninvestment decisions about where to construct or renovate housing units.”  ICP VI, 135 S.Ct.\nat 2524.  Therefore, “if the ICP cannot show a causal connection between [TDHCA’s] policy\nand a disparate impact—for instance, because federal law substantially limits [TDHCA’s]\ndiscretion—that should result in dismissal of this case.”  Id. (citing Jones, J., specially\nconcurring in ICP V, 747 F.3d at 283-84).  ICP has failed to demonstrate that local zoning\n- 21 -\n\nrules, community preferences, or developers’ choices did not contribute to the statistical\ndisparity.  For example, TDHCA asserted at oral argument, and ICP does not refute, that no\ndevelopers have applied for credits for developments in predominately Caucasian areas in\nthe City of Dallas since 1995.  Accordingly, TDHCA has neither granted nor denied any such\napplication, and it is not TDHCA’s discretion that has caused the lower number of LIHTC\nunits in the City of Dallas. \nICP also attempts to causally link to a cumulative statistical disparity TDHCA’s\nexercise of discretion in a case-by-case review during an annual-cycle over a multi-year\nperiod.  The facts belie ICP’s position.  Each year, TDHCA decides whether to approve or\ndeny applications for 9% tax credits submitted that year.  Because there is a fixed number\nof credits that TDHCA can award, it must compare the applications during each annual cycle\nand decide which ones to award.  TDHCA does not, however, compare applications\nsubmitted in one year to applications submitted in a different year.  In other words,\nTDHCA’s approval of an application in 2000 should have no effect on its denial of an\napplication in 2003, and vice versa.  Accordingly, ICP’s reliance on a statistical disparity that\nhas accumulated over a multi-year period is misplaced; the disparity cannot be causally\nlinked to the exercise of discretion in a single year.  \nFinally, ICP acknowledges that the discretion exercised by TDHCA has changed from\nyear to year.  In other words, the policy to which ICP attributes a cumulative disparity has\nin fact changed during that time period.  For example, from 1995 to 2011, the QAP permitted\nTDHCA to award forward commitments.  But TDHCA has not been authorized to award\n- 22 -\n\nforward commitments since 2011.  The point system set forth in the QAP has also changed\nfrom year to year.  Because the challenged policy has changed from year to year in each\nQAP, ICP cannot point to a specific policy that caused an aggregate statistical disparity over\na multi-year period.  See, e.g., City of Miami, 2016 WL 1072488, at *5 & n.3 (holding that\nplaintiff failed to demonstrate disparate impact where it “lump[ed] together eight years of\ndata” over which time period defendant’s policies had changed). \nD\nIn addition to challenging TDHCA’s general policy of exercising discretion in\nawarding tax credits, ICP also challenges several specific ways in which TDHCA exercises\nits discretion.  For the reasons explained supra at § IV(A)(2), the court holds that TDHCA’s\nuse of discretion is not a specific, facially neutral policy that can support a claim for disparate\nimpact.  But assuming arguendo that ICP can prove a disparate impact claim based on a\nspecific exercise of discretion, the court must still decide whether ICP has proved that the\nexercise of discretion has caused a statistically significant disparity in the approval of 9% tax\ncredits.  ICP relies on the following specific exercises of discretion: (1) “discretionary\nforward commitments in the 9% program”; (2) “other exercises of discretion in taking factors\nother than point totals into account in the 9% program”; (3) “discretion in the scoring of 9%\nselection criteria”; (4) “the discretionary decision to eliminate taking into account in\nindividual allocation decisions whether the project would provide desegregated housing\nopportunities in connection with court ordered desegregation remedies”; (5) “using discretion\nto allocate 9% tax credits for units restricted to elderly only residents”; (6) “discretion in\n- 23 -\n\nselecting groups of applications for guaranteed allocations through set asides”; and (7) “the\nexercise of discretion to approve rather than disapprove projects that would be located in\nareas marked by conditions of slum and blight, high crime rates, noxious industrial uses,\nadverse environmental conditions, and concentrations of LIHTC units.”  ICP 1/7/16 Prima\nFacie Br. at 2.\n1\nICP complains of TDHCA’s discretion to award forward commitments to applications\nseeking 9% tax credits.  According to ICP, each QAP from 1995 to 2011 permitted TDHCA\nto award any eligible 9% tax credit application an allocation of credits from the following\nyear’s allocation rather than from the current year’s allocation.  For example, TDHCA could\ndeny an application for tax credits in 1999 but commit to award the applicant tax credits in\n2000.  ICP alleges that, although no QAP from 2012 to the present expressly gives TDHCA\ndiscretion to award forward commitments, pertinent regulations governing the award of tax\ncredits permit TDHCA to exercise such discretion today.\nTDHCA responds that it used its discretion to award forward commitments on a case-\nby-case basis to award credits for projects that were “uniquely deserving” but that did not\nhave enough points to be awarded credits in the application year; the current QAP does not\nallow for forward commitments, and ICP’s complaint is moot; ICP has not identified a policy\nof awarding forward commitments sufficient to state a prima facie case; and ICP has not\nalleged facts demonstrating a statistical imbalance caused by the approval or denial of\nforward commitments.\n- 24 -\n\nICP has not satisfied the robust causality requirement.  Although ICP has proved that\nTDHCA gave forward commitments to several applications for 9% tax credits, ICP has not\nproved a statistical disparity caused by the forward commitments.  For example, ICP has not\nproved how many applications were awarded forward commitments that would not otherwise\nhave been awarded tax credits in their application years or in the following year, or what\napplications  would  have  been  awarded  had  the  applications  been  denied  instead  of\nforwarded.  ICP has not proved how the statistical disparity would have lessened if TDHCA\nhad no discretion to award forward commitments.9      \n2\nICP also complains of TDHCA’s discretion to take into account factors other than\npoint totals, and its discretion in scoring applications for tax credits.  TDHCA responds that\nICP has not isolated and identified a specific policy causing a disparity, as required by the\nSupreme Court, and that this court therefore cannot craft a remedial order eliminating the\noffending policy.  TDHCA also argues that what ICP is actually seeking is for the court to\nengineer a QAP so as to remedy racial imbalance in housing and to achieve ICP’s ideal\ndistribution of LIHTC units, and that the Supreme Court has cautioned that such remedies\nraise serious constitutional concerns.\nICP has not proved that TDHCA’s exercise of discretion in scoring or in taking other\nfactors into account has caused a statistically-significant disparity.  As discussed supra at §\n9TDHCA also argues that, because the QAP no longer grants TDHCA discretion to\naward forward commitments, there is nothing for the court to remedy.  The court agrees. \n- 25 -\n\nIV(A)(2), ICP has not demonstrated a specific policy that the court could remedy, or that\nTDHCA’s  discretion  to  consider  factors  other  than  points  has  caused  a  statistically-\nsignificant disparity. \n3\nICP complains of TDHCA’s decision not to consider whether a proposed development\nwould provide desegregated housing opportunities.  According to ICP, until 1994, TDHCA\nawarded additional points for developments located in Caucasian areas.  After 1994, TDHCA\ncould in its discretion award additional points for desegregated developments, but chose not\nto do so.\nTDHCA responds that ICP has failed to allege any facts demonstrating that, had\nTDHCA awarded additional points to applications for developments in Caucasian areas,\nthose applications would have been approved, or that approval of such applications would\nhave lessened the statistical disparity.\nICP has failed to prove that TDHCA’s decision not to award additional points for\nprojects that provide desegregated housing caused any statistical disparity.  In addition, ICP\ndoes not seek any constitutionally-sound remedy—i.e., the “elimination of the offending\npractice.”  ICP VI, 135 S.Ct. at 2524.  ICP does not seek to remove a specific barrier to fair\nhousing, but to impose on TDHCA the requirement that it award additional points for\nhousing that furthers desegregation.  The Supreme Court has made clear that such remedies\nare constitutionally suspect, and the court declines to impose such remedy.  See id.; see also\nWells Fargo, 2015 WL 4398858, at *8 (holding that absence of policy cannot form basis for\n- 26 -\n\ndisparate impact claim because there is nothing to remedy).  \n4\nICP challenges TDHCA’s discretion to allocate tax credits to units for elderly-only\nresidents and the use of set-asides for elderly-only units.  TDHCA has the discretion to “set\naside” certain types of applications and to score these applications in their subset, rather than\nagainst the general application pool.  From 2001 to 2003, TDHCA set aside a certain number\nof 9% tax credits for units for elderly residents.  ICP complains that TDHCA did not\nestablish a set-aside for applications for units located in Caucasian areas, and it challenges\nTDHCA’s use of elderly-only set-asides.\nTDHCA responds that ICP does not explain how TDHCA’s decision to set aside a\ncertain number of tax credits for elderly-only developments caused the placement of more\nLIHTC units in minority areas than in Caucasian areas, and that ICP has not proved that, had\nTDHCA not set aside any tax credits for elderly-only developments, the racial disparity\nwould have been lessened.\nICP has not proved that TDHCA’s use of set-asides or other allocation of LIHTC for\nelderly-only units has caused a statistically-significant disparity, and it has not proved how\ntax credits for elderly-only units in Caucasian areas contributes to racial disparity in housing. \nTo the extent ICP asks the court to require that TDHCA implement a new set-aside for\napplications for family units in Caucasian areas, such a remedy is not constitutionally sound,\ndoes not eliminate an offending practice, and may result in the use of racial quotas.  See ICP\nVI, 135 S.Ct. at 2524.  \n- 27 -\n\n5 \nFinally, ICP maintains that TDHCA has used its discretion to approve projects located\nin areas of slum and blight, with high crime rates, adverse environmental conditions, and\nwhere there is a high concentration of LIHTC units.  TDHCA responds that ICP’s concerns\nare exaggerated, and that ICP has not demonstrated that the decision to approve projects in\ncertain areas causes a statistically-significant disparity.\nICP has not established that TDHCA’s approval of projects in areas of slum and blight\ncaused a racially disparate impact, and ICP does not seek a constitutionally-permissible\nremedy.  ICP does not seek to restrict TDHCA’s discretion or to remove a challenged policy;\ninstead,  ICP  asks  the  court  to  preclude  the  TDHCA  from  granting  tax  credits  for\ndevelopments in areas with certain conditions.  For the reasons explained supra at §\nIV(A)(2), the court declines to grant such remedy. \nV \nThe court turns next to the question whether ICP has proved a prima facie case of\ndisparate impact with respect to the allocation of 4% tax credits.\nA\nICP contends that TDHCA exercised its discretion to implement specific discretionary\npolicies, practices, and decisions affecting the allocation of 4% tax credits, and that the\nexercise of discretion caused the perpetuation of racial segregation.  According to ICP,\nTDHCA consistently used its discretion to approve applications for 4% tax credits for units\nin minority areas that maintained racial disparity across the Dallas metropolitan area, already\n- 28 -\n\nhad a high concentration of LIHTC units, and were plagued by slum and blight.  ICP\ncomplains that, once in 1999 and once in 2003, the TDHCA exercised its discretion and\ndenied applications for 4% tax credits for projects located in Caucasian tracts in the Dallas\nmetropolitan area for reasons that were not applied to applications for 4% tax credits for\nsimilar projects located in minority areas.  ICP maintains that TDHCA’s exercise of\ndiscretion resulted in the approval of 4% tax credits for 4,896 of the 7,283 units in minority\nareas in the City of Dallas.\nTDHCA responds that discretion in and of itself is not a specific policy sufficient to\nprove disparate impact based on a violation of the FHA; each decision to approve or deny\na tax credit is the result of numerous individual policy decisions, many of which are outside\nTDHCA’s control; the 4% tax credit program is not oversubscribed, and ICP has not alleged\nthat TDHCA approved a 4% tax credit for a project in a minority area that required it to deny\na 4% tax credit for a project in a Caucasian area; ICP only identifies two projects for which\nTDHCA denied applications for 4% tax credits over a span of 17 years; and ICP has not\nacknowledged that, unless developers seek 4% tax credits for projects in Caucasian areas,\nTDHCA cannot allocate such credits.\nICP replies that TDHCA perpetuated racial segregation by using its discretion to\napprove applications for 4% tax credits in minority areas with undesirable site conditions,\nand by denying two applications for 4% tax credits for projects in Caucasian areas.\n- 29 -\n\nB\nEven assuming arguendo that ICP has proved that TDHCA had a facially neutral\npolicy or practice in allocating 4% tax credits—the use of discretion in the allocation of 4%\ntax credits—ICP has not proved that TDHCA’s exercise of discretion caused a statistically-\nsignificant disparity in the location of low-income housing. \nICP maintains that TDHCA in its discretion denied the applications of two projects\nfor 4% credits, even though the projects met the stated criteria for approval.  In 1999,\nTDHCA rejected an application for 4% credits for the Treymore at Duck Creek, a project in\na Caucasian tract in Garland, Texas.  TDHCA’s stated reasons for the denial were the\n“desires of the elected officials of the City of Garland,” i.e., that Garland had sufficient low-\nincome housing and did not need additional units.  ICP casts doubt on the TDHCA’s stated\nreason and alleges that the following year, TDHCA approved an application for 4% tax\ncredits for a low-income housing development in a minority tract in Garland.\nIn 2003, TDHCA exercised its discretion to deny an application for 4% tax credits for\nthe Primrose at Stonebrook, a housing development in Frisco, Texas.  The Stonebrook was\na proposed development of three-bedroom units located in a Caucasian area in Frisco, and\nTDHCA denied the project because it lacked diversity in the type of units.  ICP argues that\nTDHCA’s proffered reason is pretextual because TDHCA waived unit-mix requirements for\nother applications and approved other developments containing only three- or four-bedroom\nunits.\nICP has not satisfied the robust causality requirement of ICP VI.  See ICP VI, 135\n- 30 -\n\nS.Ct. at 2523.  ICP states, without explanation or supporting evidence, that TDHCA’s\ndiscretion in awarding 4% credits has resulted in the approval of 4,896 of the 7,283 units for\n4% tax credits located in minority areas in the Dallas metropolitan area.  Although ICP states\nthat “TDHCA did consistently use its discretion to approve 4% application[s] for units in\nminority areas that maintained the racial segregation,” ICP 1/7/16 Prima Facie Br. at 42, ICP\ndoes not explain how TDHCA’s exercise of discretion in denying two applications over a 17-\nyear period has maintained racial segregation.  \nICP has not established that TDHCA’s denial of two applications over a 17-year\nperiod is a “policy” that can cause a disparate impact.  See, e.g., ICP VI, 135 S.Ct. at 2523\n(noting that a “one-time decision may not be a policy at all”).  Nor has ICP proved that\nTDHCA’s denial of two applications for 4% tax credits over that time period has caused any\nstatistically-significant disparity in the location of low-income housing.  \nICP has also failed to prove that factors other than TDHCA’s discretion—such as\ndevelopers’ preferences for building projects in certain areas, local and state laws, and the\nexpressed needs of communities and local officials—have not caused or contributed to any\ndisparity in the location of housing developments receiving 4% tax credits.  Because TDHCA\nhas approved the vast majority of applications for 4% tax credits since 1999, any disparity\nis likely caused by factors other than TDHCA’s exercise of discretion.   \n- 31 -\n\n*     *     *\nFor the reasons explained, the court finds and concludes that ICP has failed to prove\na prima facie case of discrimination by showing that a challenged practice caused a\ndiscriminatory effect, as defined by 24 C.F.R. § 100.500(a).  Accordingly, the court\ndismisses ICP’s disparate impact claim and enters judgment today in favor of defendants.\nAugust 26, 2016.\n_________________________________\nSIDNEY A.
