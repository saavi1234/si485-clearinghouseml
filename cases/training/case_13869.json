    "summary": "<p>On May 30, 2014, the City of Los Angeles filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The City sued JP Morgan Chase Bank under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Fair Housing Act/Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA). The City sought damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the bank's lending practices were predatory, intentionally discriminated against minority borrowers, and had a disparate impact on minorities. </p><p>Specifically, the complaint alleged disparate impact claims, based on statistical data, that: 1) lending practices resulted in disproportionate number of foreclosures in minority neighborhoods; 2) minority homeowners received disproportionate number of predatory loans. It also alleged the bank intentionally discriminated against minorities by: 1) targeting minorities for predatory loans; 2) underwriting adjustable loan rates that borrowers could not afford; and 3) inducing foreclosures by refusing to offer refinancing or loan restructuring on fair terms. The City claimed it was injured as a result of the bank's practices through loss of property tax and decrease in property value.</p><p>The City also brought two other actions regarding discriminatory and predatory lending against Wells Fargo (City of Los Angeles v. Wells Fargo & Company, No. 2:13-cv-09007-ODW) and Citigroup (City of Los Angeles v. Citigroup, Inc., No. 2:13-cv-09009-ODW), respectively.</p><p>On June 25, 2014, the bank filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing and failure to state a claim. On August 5, 2014, Judge Otis D. Wright granted the motion to dismiss but gave the City 21 days to amend its complaint. 2014 WL 3854332 (N.D. Cal. 2014).</p><p>On August 26, 2014, the City filed an amended complaint that again alleged that the defendant had engaged in discriminatory and predatory lending practices, adding that minorities in fact received predatory loan terms from JP Morgan and that these loan terms led to rapid foreclosure. The complaint further alleged that the City had been injured by the bank's practices because it still had to provide costly municipal services for properties in minority neighborhoods that had became vacant as a direct result of discriminatory loans originated or purchased by the bank.</p><p>On November 14, 2014, Judge Wright denied JP Morgan's motion to dismiss, stating that the City's allegations were sufficient to withstand the pleading stage. Judge Wright found the City's allegations regarding causation to be sufficient to assert standing, and ruled that Chase's arguments for dismissing the case for failure to state a claim went to the weight of the evidence, not the sufficiency of the pleading. </p><p>In the related case against Wells Fargo, on July 17, 2015, the Court granted summary judgment against the City. 2015 WL 4398858 (C.D. Cal. July 17, 2015). As a result, on August 6, 2015, the City filed an ex parte application to stay this case pending appeal of the Wells Fargo action, in order to avoid duplicative litigation both in the trial court and on appeal. </p><p>However, on September 2, 2015, the court (Judge Otis D. Wright II) dismissed the case with prejudice, as stipulated between the parties. We do not know if the matter was settled, or if Los Angeles simply withdrew it.  No settlement papers are available. </p>",

ORDER GRANTING \n14 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.;  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO \n15 JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.; and  DISMISS WITH LEAVE TO AMEND\n16 CHASE MANHATTAN BANK USA,  [28] \n17 N.A., \n18     Defendants. \n19 I.  INTRODUCTION \n20   This action is the fourth installment of  the discriminatory lending suits brought \n21 by Plainti ff City of Los Angeles (“the City ”) against large lending insti tutions.  \n22 Defendants in this action are JPMorgan Ch ase & Co.; JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A.;  \n23 and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A. (collectively, “Chase”).  The City is seeking to \n24 recover damages under the federal Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601–19, \n25 for lost property-tax revenue and increas ed mu nicipal services stemming fro m \n26 foreclosures that are allegedly the result of discriminatory lending practices. \n27   But unlike the previous install ments—where m otions to dism iss have been \n28 denied—Chase raises a new ground for di smissal in its Motion to Dism iss, unique to \n\n  \n1 Chase, which the Court finds warrants a diffe rent result.  For th e reasons discussed \n2 below, the Court  GRANTS Defendan ts’ Motion to Dism iss  WITH LEAVE TO \n1\n3 AMEND.   (ECF No. 28.) \n4 II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5   The City filed the Co mplaint on May 30, 2014 ,  asserting  two  claims  for          \n6 (1) violating the FH A, and (2) co mmon-law restitution.  (ECF No. 1.)  According to \n7 the City, Chase has engaged in discriminatory lending practices that have resulted in a \n8 disparate number of foreclosures in minority areas of Los Angeles.  (See Compl. ¶ 2.)  \n9 The City is seeking t o recover lost property-tax revenue as well as expenses incurred \n10 for increased municipal services as  a result of these foreclosures.  ( See id. ¶ 155. )  \n11   There are three related cases in the Central District of California where the City \n12 has brought identical claim s against othe r large lending institu tions.  Motions to \n13 dismiss have already been denied in  each of the related cases.  ( City of L.A. v. Wells \n14 Fargo, No. 2:13-cv-9007-ODW(RZx), ECF No. 37;  City of L.A. v. Citigroup Inc. ,  \n15 No. 2:13-cv-9009-ODW(RZx), ECF No. 47;  City of L.A. v. Bank of Am.Corp.,  No. \n16 2:13-cv-9046-PA(AGRx), ECF No. 50.)   \n17   As in the related cases, the City a lleges here that Chase has engaged in \n18 “redlining” and “reverse redlining.”  (C ompl. ¶ 4.)  Red lining is the practice of \n19 denying credit to particular ne ighborhoods based on race.  ( Id. ¶ 4 n.2.)  Reverse \n20 redlining is the practice of flooding a m inority neighborhood with exploitative loan \n21 products.  (Id. ¶ 4 n.3.)  The lengthy Complaint also includes a regression analysis of \n22 loans allegedly issued by Chase in Los Angeles, and alleges numerous statistics based \n23 on this analysis.  ( See, e.g. , id. ¶¶ 101–06.)  In addition,  the Com plaint includes \n24 confidential witness statements from  former employees who describe how minorities \n25 were allegedly steered toward predatory loans.  (Id. ¶¶ 61–93.)   \n26 / / / \n27\n                                                           \n28 1 After carefully considering the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court \ndeems the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. \n \n2\n\n  \n1   But unique to this case is the rela tionship between Chase and Washington \n2 Mutual Bank (“WaMu”).  Th e City seeks to  hold Chase liable, in part, based on the \n3 discriminatory loans issued by WaMu.  (Id. ¶ 2 n.1, ¶ 29.)  WaMu failed in 2008 when \n4 the Office of Thrift Supervision seized  WaMu’s assets and operations, placing them \n5 into recei vership with the Federal Depos it Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  ( Id.        \n6 ¶ 26);  see also Benson v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 673 F.3d 1207, 1210 (9th     \n7 Cir. 2012).  The FDIC then transferred cer tain WaMu assets a nd liabilities to C hase \n8 under a Purchase and Assum ption Agreement.  (Com pl. ¶¶ 26–29);  see also Benson, \n2\n9 673 F.3d at 1210.   In the Complaint, the City alleges that “[t]he liabilities assumed by \n10 JPMorgan & Co. include the clai ms alleged by Los Angeles herein.”  (Compl. ¶ 26.)  \n11 Throughout the remainder of the Com plaint, the City does not disti nguish between \n12 loans originating from WaMu and loans originating from Chase.  (See id. ¶ 2 n.1.) \n13   On June 25, 2014, Chase filed the pres ent Motion to Dism iss.  (ECF No. 28.)   \n14 Chase raises the same grounds for dismissal  that were addressed in the three relat ed \n15 cases.  But Chase also rais es a new issue based on WaMu’s failure , the FDIC’s \n16 receivership, and Chase’s subsequent purchas e of WaMu’s assets.   Th e City timely \n17 opposed the Motion (ECF No. 32), and Chase filed a timely Reply (ECF No. 35.)  The \n18 Court took the matter under submission on July 28, 2014.   \n19 III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n20 A. Rule  12(b)(1) \n21 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1 ) provides for dismissal of a complaint \n22 for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.   Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attacks can be \n23 either facial or factual.  White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000).   \n24 When a motion to dismiss att acks subject-matter jurisdiction on the face of the \n25 complaint, the court assu mes the factual a llegations in the co mplaint are true an d \n26 draws all reasonable inferences  in the plaintiff’s favor.   Doe v. Holy S ee, 557 F.3d \n27\n                                                           \n28 2 The entire Purchase and Assumption Agreem ent is available o n the FDIC’s website at  \nwww.fdic.gov/about/freedom/Washington_Mutual_P_and_A.pdf. \n \n3\n\n  \n1 1066, 1073 (9th Cir. 2009).  Moreover, the standards set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \n2 Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), apply in \n3 equal force to facial challenges of subject-matter jurisdiction.  See Perez v. Nidek Co., \n4 711 F.3d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir. 2013);  Terenkian v. Republic of Iraq , 694 F.3d 1122, \n5 1131 (9th Cir. 2012).  Thus, in terms of Article III standing, the complaint must allege \n6 “sufficient factual matter, accep ted as true, to ‘state a clai m to relief that is plausible \n7 on its face.’”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).   \n8 On the other hand, with a factual Rule 12(b)(1) attack, a court may look beyond \n9 the complaint.  See White, 227 F.3d at 1242–43 (affirming judicial notice of matters of \n10 public record in Rul e 12(b)(1) factual at tack); see also Augustine v. U.S. , 704 F.2d \n11 1074, 1077 (9th Cir. 1983) (holding that a  district court is free to hear evidence \n12 regarding jurisdiction).  In a factual attack , a court need not presum e the truthfulness \n13 of the allegations in the com plaint.   White, 227 F.3d at 1242.  But courts should \n14 refrain from resolving factual issues where  “the jurisdictional issue and substa ntive \n15 issues are so intertwined that the question of jurisdiction is dependent on resolution of \n16 the factual issues going to the  merits.”   Augustine, 704 F.2d at 1077 (hol ding that \n17 resolution of factual issues going to the merits requires a court to employ the standard \n18 applicable to a motion for summary judgment).   \n19 B. Rule  12(b)(6) \n20 Under Rule 12(b)(6), a court may dism iss a complaint for lack of a cognizable \n21 legal theory or insufficient facts pleaded  to support an ot herwise cognizable legal \n22 theory.   Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t , 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Ci r. 1990).  To \n23 survive a dismissal motion, a complaint need only satisfy the minimal notice pleading \n24 requirements of Rul e 8(a)(2)—a short  and plain statement of the claim.   Porter v. \n25 Jones, 319 F.3d 483, 494 (9th Cir. 2003).  The f actual “allegations must be enough to \n26 raise a right to relief above the speculativ e level” and a claim  for relief m ust be \n27 “plausible on its face.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570.   \n28 / / / \n \n4\n\n  \n1   The determination whether a com plaint satisfies the plausibility standard is a  \n2 “context-specific task that requires the re viewing court t o draw on its judi cial \n3 experience and common sense.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S at 679.  A court is generally lim ited \n4 to the pleadings and m ust construe all “factual allegations set forth in the co mplaint     \n5 . . . as true and . . . in the light most favorable” to the plaintiff.  Lee v. City of L.A., 250 \n6 F.3d 668,  688 (9th Cir. 2001).  But  a c ourt need not blindl y accept conclusory \n7 allegations, unwarranted deductions of fact, and unreasonable inferences.  Sprewell v. \n8 Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9t h Cir. 2001 ).  Moreover, a court may \n9 take judicial notice of matters of public record without converting the motion into one \n10 for summary judgment.  E.g., Skilstaf, Inc. v. CVS  Caremark Corp., 669 F.3d 1005,  \n11 1016 n.9 (9th Cir. 2012). \n12   As a general rule, a court should freely give leave to amend a complaint that has \n13 been dismissed.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).   But a court may den y leave to amend when \n14 “the court determines that the allegation of other fa cts consistent with the challenged \n15 pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.”  Schreiber Distrib. Co. v. Serv-Well \n16 Furniture Co., 806 F.2d 1393, 1401 (9t h Cir.1986);  see Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d \n17 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000). \n18 IV.  DISCUSSION \n19   Chase moves to dism iss the Co mplaint on several fam iliar grounds.  Chase  \n20 contends that the City’s claims are barred by the statute of limitations and that the City \n21 lacks Article III and statutory standing.  In  addition, Chase argue s that the City has \n22 failed to state a claim  for e ither disparate treatment or dispa rate impact under t he \n23 FHA, and that the City’s restitution claim fails because no benefit has been conferred.  \n24 But unlike the m otions to dismiss in the re lated cases, Chase brings a new basis for \n25 dismissal, unique to this action: the jurisd ictional bar in the Fi nancial Institutions \n26 Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act  of 1989 (“FIRREA”), 12 U.S.C. § 1821.   \n27 For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that Chase’s FIRREA argument has \n28 merit, and it need not reach the remainder of Chase’s arguments in the Motion.  \n \n5\n\n  \n1 A.  FIRREA’S Jurisdictional Bar \n2   Chase argues that, under FIRREA, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to \n3 adjudicate the City’s claims that relate to WaMu’s origination of discriminatory loans \n4 before the bank’s failure in 2008.  (Mot.  3:25–6:2.)  Moreover, since the City makes \n5 no distinction between WaMu and Chase in the Complaint, the entire Complaint must \n6 be dism issed.  ( Id. at 8:15–12:13.)  But the City contends that Chase interprets \n7 FIRREA’s jurisdictional bar  too broadly and that Chase assum ed liability for the \n8 City’s claims in the Purchase and Assumption Agreement.  (Opp’n 3:18–11:11.)   \n9   Congress’s purpose in enacting FIRREA in  the late 1980s was “to enable the \n10 federal government to respon d swiftly and effectively to the declining financial  \n11 condition of the nation’s banks and savings institutions.”  Henderson v. Bank of New \n12 England, 986 F.2d 319, 320 (9th Cir. 1993).  The statute grants “the FDIC authority to \n13 act as receiver or conservator of a failed institution for the protection of depositors and \n14 creditors.”  Benson, 673 F.3d at 1211 (internal quotati ons and citations omitted).  The \n15 FDIC’s authority i ncludes de tailed procedures for consid ering clai ms ag ainst the \n16 receivership “to ensure that the assets of  a failed institution are distributed fairly and \n17 promptly among those with valid claim s against the institution, and to expeditiously \n18 wind up the affairs of failed banks.”   McCarthy v. FDIC, 348 F.3d 1073, 1079 (9th \n19 Cir. 2003) (i nternal quotatio ns and citations om itted);  see also  12 U.S.C. § \n20 1821(d)(3)–(10). \n21   In addition, FIRREA strips courts of jurisdiction over claims that have not been \n22 exhausted through the FDIC’s claims process: \n23 Except as otherwise provi ded in thi s subsection, no court  shall have \n24 jurisdiction over— \n25 (i) any clai m or action for pay ment from , or any action seeking a  \n26 determination of rights with respect  to, the assets of any depository \n27 institution for which the [FDIC] has  been appointed receiver, including \n28 assets which the [FDIC] may acquire from itself as such receiver; or \n \n6\n\n  \n1 (ii) any claim  relating to any act or  omission of such institution or the \n2 [FDIC] as receiver. \n3 12 U.S.C. § 1821(d)(13)(D). \n4   According to Chase, § 1821(d)(13)(D)(ii)  bars the City’s clai ms here to the \n5 extent that they include the allegedly disc riminatory lending practices of WaMu.  The \n6 Court agrees.  The Ninth Circuit has interp reted FIRREA’s jurisdictional bar broadly, \n7 holding that “§ 1821(d) extends to all claim s and actions against, and actions seeki ng \n8 determination of rights with respect to, th e assets of failed fina ncial institutions for \n9 which the FDIC ser ves as receiver . . . .”   McCarthy, 348 F.3d at 1079;  see also \n10 Rundgren v. Wash. Mut. Bank, FA , No. 12-15368, --- F.3d - --, 2014 WL 3720238,     \n11 at *3 (9th Cir. July 29, 201 4) (holding that §  1821(d)(13)(D) “is drafted broadly” to \n12 “preclude federal courts from  exercising  jurisdiction over non- exhausted claims by \n13 any claimant”).   \n14   Moreover, FIRREA does not distinguish  claims based on the identit y of the \n15 defendant, but rather on the f actual bases of the clai ms.   Benson, 673 F.3d at 1212.   \n16 Thus, courts are divested of jurisdiction  over claims against a purchasing bank—like \n17 Chase—when the claims are “based on t he conduct of a failed inst itution” such that \n18 the claims are “functionally, albeit not formally against a failed bank.”  Id. at 1214–15 \n19 (internal quotations omitted). \n20   Here, the City explicitly seeks to ho ld Chase liable for WaMu’s lending \n21 practices in the Complaint.  (See Compl. ¶ 2 n.1, ¶ 29.)  The City’s regression analysis \n22 includes loans that were originated betw een 2004 and 2008, when  WaMu was still in \n23 operation.  ( See id .  ¶¶ 101–02.)  In addition, some  of the confidential witness \n24 statements in the Complaint are from former WaMu employees (id. ¶ 61), and Chase \n25 has supplied judicially noticeable evidence  that a number of the “sam ple foreclosure \n26 properties” listed in the Complaint were issued by WaMu.  (Id. ¶ 145; ECF No. 30        \n27 / / / \n28 / / / \n \n7\n\n  \n3\n1 (“RJN”), Exs. 1–8.)   The Court finds that  the City has brought claim s related to \n2 WaMu’s acts or omi ssions.  Since the cl aims are b ased, at least in part, on a fail ed \n3 institution’s conduct, FIRREA’s jurisdictional bar is im plicated.   See Benson, 673 \n4 F.3d at 1214–15.   \n5   In its Opposition, the City attem pts to steer the Court away from  the Ninth  \n6 Circuit’s holdi ng i n  Benson, pointing to out-of-circuit case law an d subsequent \n7 unpublished decisions to m aintain its claim s against Chase that relate to WaMu’s \n8 lending activities.  (Opp’n 4:3–7:21.)  But th e Court finds no reason to stray from  the \n9 unambiguous holdi ng i n  Benson—despite its breadth—partic ularly in light of the \n10 Ninth Circuit’s most recent FIRREA opinion.   See Rundgren, 2014 WL 3720238,      \n11 at *7 (“A claim ant cannot circum vent  the exhaustion requirement by suing the \n12 purchasing bank based on the conduct of the failed institution.”). \n13   The City also argues that the holding in  Benson omits a necessary step in the \n14 analysis here—whether Chase assumed liability for the claims at issue in the Purchase \n15 and Assum ption Agreement.  (Opp’n 8:3–11: 11.)  The Ci ty contends that Chase \n16 assumed liability for WaMu’s conduct alleged in the Complaint, so the claims are not \n17 “susceptible of resol ution” under FI RREA’s administrative procedure.  ( Id.; Not. of \n18 Supp. Auth. at 1.)  However, the Court disagrees. \n19   First, the  Court is not convinced th at interpretation of the Purchase an d \n20 Assumption Agreement is necessary to dete rmine whether the claims are “susceptible \n21 of resolution” through the administrative claims procedure.   See McCarthy, 348 F.3d \n22 at 1081 (“FIRREA’s exhaustion requirement applies to any claim or action respecting \n23 the assets of a failed institution for which the FDIC is receiver.”).  Neither Benson nor \n24 Rundgren rely on interpretations of the Pu rchase and Assum ption Agreement in \n25\n                                                           \n26 3 The documents in Chase’s Request for Judicial No tice are deeds of trust for eight of the “sam ple \nforeclosure properties” listed in the Complaint.  The deeds of trust have all been recorded in the Los \n27\nAngeles County Recorder’s Office a nd list WaMu or a WaMu subsidiary as the lender.  The Court \n28 finds that they are not subject to reasonable di spute as  they are m atter of public record  and \nGRANTS the Request for Judicial Notice.  (ECF No. 30); Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). \n \n8\n\n  \n4\n1 holding that FIRREA barred the plaintiffs’ claims in district court.   In fact, the co urt \n2 in Rundgren explicitly held that  § 1821(d)(13)(D) “precludes courts from exercising \n3 jurisdiction over ‘any claim relating to any act or omission’ of a failed bank,  without \n4 respect to the identity of the claimant.”  2014 WL 3720238, at *3 (emphasis added).   \n5   But the Court acknowledges that bot h  Benson  and  Rundgren  involved \n6 borrowers, which distinguishes them  from the City’s claims here.  ( See Compl. ¶ 29 \n7 (“Los Angeles is not a borrower, it is not  pursuing a derivative claim on behalf of any \n8 borrower, and is not seeking damages on behalf of any borrower.”).)   However,  even \n9 under the Purchase and Assum ption Agreement, the Court finds t hat Chase did not  \n5\n10 assume liability for the City’s  claims relating to WaMu.   Thus, dism issal of the \n11 WaMu allegations would still be proper. \n12   Section 2.1 of the Purchase and  Assumption Agreement titled “Liabilities \n13 Assumed by Assuming Bank” provides: \n14 Subject to Sections 2.5 and 4. 8, the Assuming Bank [Chase] expressly \n15 assumes at Book Value (subject to ad justment pursuant to Article VIII) \n16 and agrees to pay, perform , and disc harge, all of the liabilities of the  \n17 Failed Bank [WaMu] which are reflect ed on the Books and Records of \n18 the Failed Bank as of Bank Closing, including the Assumed Deposits and \n19 all liabilities associated with an y and all employee benefit plans, except \n20 as listed on the attached Schedule 2.1,  and as otherwise provi ded in this \n21 Agreement (such liabilities referred  to as “Liabilities Assumed”).   \n22 Nothwithstanding Section 4.8, the  Assuming Bank specificall y assumes \n23 all mortgage servicing rights and obligations of the Failed Bank. \n24\n                                                           \n25 4 The court in  Rundgren did include Section 2.5 of the Purc hase and Assumption Agreement in a \nfootnote in its factual bac kground.  2014 W L 3720238, at *1.  But th e court never addressed the \n26\nPurchase and Assumption Agreement in its later analysis. \n5 The City specifically incorporates relevant sections of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement in \n27\nthe Complaint.  (Compl. ¶¶ 27–28.)  The Court may take judicial notice of the entire document since \n28 the Complaint necessarily relies on it, its au thenticity is not contes ted, and it is par t of the public \nrecord as the FDIC is a party to the Agreement.  Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d at 688–89.     \n \n9\n\n  \n1 Section 2.5 of the Purchase and Assum ption Agreement relates specifically to loans \n2 issued by WaMu and reads as follows: \n3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any liability \n4 associated with borrower claim s for pay ment of or liability to any \n5 borrower for monetary relief, or that  provide for any other form of relief \n6 to any borrower, whether or not such  liability is reduced to judgm ent, \n7 liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or  contingent, matured or unm atured, \n8 disputed or undi sputed, legal or equit able, judicial or extra-judicial, \n9 secured or unsecured, whether assert ed affirm atively or defensively, \n10 related in any way to any loan or commitment to lend made by the Failed \n11 Bank [WaMu] prior to failure, or to  any loan m ade by a third part y in \n12 connection with a loan which is or  was held by the Fail ed Bank, or \n13 otherwise arising in connection with  the Failed Bank’s lending or l oan \n14 purchase activities are specifically not assumed by the Assum ing Bank \n15 [Chase].  \n16   According to the City, these two sections  read together demonstrate that Chas e \n17 assumed liability for the City’s claim s relating to WaMu’s lending activities.  The \n18 City contends that Section 2.5 only appli es to borrower claims, and the City is not a \n19 borrower.  (Opp’n 10:3–11:11;  Compl. ¶ 29. )  The City then argues that Ch ase has \n20 only mounted a facial attack under Rule 12(b )(1), so the City’s allegations that Chase \n21 assumed liability under the Purchase and Assumption Agreement per Section 2.1 must \n22 be accepted as true .  (Opp’n 9:6–10:2;  Compl. ¶ 26 (“The  liabilities assum ed by  \n23 JPMorgan & Co. include the clai ms alle ged by Los Angeles he rein.”).)  Thus,  \n24 according to the City, the  claims are not “susceptible  of resolution” through the \n25 FDIC’s claims procedure and are properly brought against Chase.   \n26   However, the Court interprets the  plain language of  the Purchase and \n27 Assumption Agreement differently.  As  Chase points out,  Section 2.1 lim its the \n28 liabilities assumed in terms of where and when they must be listed—on the Books and \n \n10\n\n  \n1 Records of WaMU as of Septem ber 25, 2008,  when WaMU’s assets were seized.   \n2 (Reply 6:9–16.)  The City ca nnot allege that the liabilitie s at issue here were on \n3 WaMu’s Books and Records in 2008, because  the City did not file this lawsuit until \n4 more than five years after WaMu’s failure.  Moreover, little weight should be given to \n5 the last sentence of Section 2.1 regarding  the assumption of mortgage servicing rights \n6 and obligations.  This sentence does not use  the word “liabilities,” but rather states \n7 that Chase assumes t he “rights” and “obliga tions” of mortgage servicing.  The Court \n8 finds that  this sent ence merely require s Chase to conti nue performance under \n9 mortgage contracts issued by WaMu.  “Ri ghts” and “obl igations” are not synonyms  \n10 for “liability” in the Purchase and Assumption Agreement.  Furthermore, as discussed \n11 below, Chase expressly disclaims any liability associated with loans issued by WaMu. \n12   With respect to Section 2.5, the City focuses on the  word “borrower.”  But the \n6\n13 Court finds that Section 2.5 i s not limited to borrower claims.    The section’s plain \n14 language disclaims liability under four circumstances, all separated by the word “or”: \n15 (1) borrower claims for m onetary relief; (2 ) borrower clai ms for any other form  of \n16 relief; (3) clai ms associated with loans made by third pa rties in connection with a \n17 WaMu loan; and (4) “any liability associated  with borrower claim s . . . otherwise \n18 arising in connection with [WaMu’s]  lendi ng or loan activities . . . .”  The last \n19 circumstance is a catch-all provisi on which  anticipates non-borrower claims such as \n20 the claims brought by the City in this action.  This is the only interpretation that makes \n21 sense without producing absurd results.  Under the City’s interpretation of Section 2.5, \n22 Chase would be free of all clai ms for di scriminatory lending  brought by borrow ers, \n23 but could still be liable to the City for the same discriminatory lending practices.  \n24   The policy behind FIRREA’s provisions al so support the Court’s interpretation \n25 of the Purchase and Assum ption Agreement.  “[FIRREA’s] design facilitates the sale \n26\n                                                           \n6 The Court notes that Section 2.5’s heading read s “Borrower Claim s.”  But Section 13.2 of t he \n27\nPurchase and Assum ption Agreement states that  headings “are inserted for convenience only and \n28 shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof.”  Thus, the \nCourt declines to narrow Section 2.5’s scope to only borrower claims based on the section’s heading. \n \n11\n\n  \n1 of a failed institution’s assets (and thus he lps to minimize the government’s financial \n2 exposure) by allowing the [receiver] to ab sorb liabilities itself and guarantee potential \n3 purchasers that the assets they buy are  not encum bered by additional financial \n4 obligations.”   Payne v. Sec. Sav . & Loan Ass’n F.A. , 924 F.2d 109,  111 (7th Cir. \n5 1991) (holding that FIRREA directs that the  receiver “is the proper successor to the  \n6 liability” absent an express tra nsfer and assumption of liability); see also Williams v. \n7 FDIC, No. CIV 2:07-2418 W BS GGH, 2009  WL 5199237, at *5 (E.D. Cal. 2009) \n8 (“[A]n assuming bank would rarely be inclin ed to enter a P & A agreement with the \n9 FDIC knowing tha t it could be taking  on unidentified liab ilities of undefined \n10 dimensions that could arise at some uncertain date in the future.”). \n11   Finally, the Court turns to the City’s  contention that Chase has mounted only a \n12 facial attack under Rule 12(b)(1), requi ring this Court to accept as true the City’s \n13 allegation that Chase assu med liability for the  claims at issue.   The City’s argument \n14 fails for two reasons.  First, the Court is  not required to accept conclusory allegations \n15 as true.  Sprewell, 266 F.3d at 988.  Second, the Cour t is merely interpreting the plain \n16 language of the Purchase and Assum ption Agreement that the City explicitly \n17 incorporates into the Complaint.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 27–28.)  The Court’s analysis here \n18 does not extend beyond t he pleadings.  Theref ore, whether Chase  is facially or \n19 factually attacking jurisdiction, or both, is  irrelevant because the Court’s lim its its \n20 analysis to a facial attack on the Complaint.   \n21   For the reasons disc ussed above, the Court fi nds that FIRREA bars this Court  \n22 from hear ing the City’s claims  as they relate to WaMu ’s discrim inatory lending \n23 practices.  The City was requi red to exhaust its claim s relating to WaMu with FDIC, \n24 which the City has not allege d.  Accordingl y, the City’s allegations against Chase \n25 relating to WaMu’s conduct are DISMISSED. \n26 B. Leave  to Amend \n27   The Court’s analysis up to this point ha s focused on the City’s allegatio ns with \n28 respect to the conduct of WaMu.  But the  Complaint’s allegations are not lim ited to \n \n12\n\n  \n1 WaMu’s discriminatory lending.  The Com plaint also includes a llegations related to \n2 Chase’s own lending practices, duri ng and  after the purchase of WaMu’s assets.   \n3 Therefore, the Court must de termine whether the City has adequately stated a claim \n4 against Chase after excising all of the a llegations related to  WaMu’s conduct.   See \n5 Benson, 673 F.3d at 1216 (holding that when a plaintiff includes allegations of both a \n6 failed bank and a purc hasing bank, courts “frequently  dismiss those portions of a \n7 claim that are barred while perm itting the  remaining portion of  a claim  to go \n8 forward.”) \n9   The probl em here is that the Court ca nnot excise the allegations re lated to \n10 WaMu from the remainder of the allegati ons.  The City’s claim s are based on a \n11 detailed regression analysis t hat lum ps  loans issued by both Chase and WaMu  \n12 together.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 101–06.)  Consequently,  the statistics resulting from  that \n13 analysis take into account WaMu conduct ove r which thi s Court lacks jurisdicti on.  \n14 Moreover, the City also relies on five conf idential witness statements, but three of \n15 those confidential witnesses worked for Wa Mu, and two of those three worked for \n16 both Wa Mu and Chase.  (Com pl. ¶¶ 61–93. )  The City also i ncludes “sam ple \n17 foreclosure properties” in the Com plaint—eight of which invol ved loans issued by \n18 WaMu.  (Compl. ¶ 145; RJN Exs. 1–8.)   \n19   The aggregation of the regression analysis, the confidential witness statements, \n20 and even the sample foreclosure properties is  integral to this Court’s analysis of the \n21 remainder of Chase’s gr ounds for dismissal.  See City of L.A. v. Citigroup, Inc. , No. \n22 2:13-cv-9009-ODW(RZx), 2014 WL 257155 8 (C.D. Cal. June 9, 2014);  City of L.A. \n23 v. Wells Fargo & Co. , No. 2:13-cv-9007-ODW(RZx), 2014 WL 2206368 (C.D. Cal. \n24 May 28, 2014).  But these key aspects of the Complaint are tainted with allegations of \n25 conduct related to WaMu’s lending ac tivities.  Accordingly, the Court  DISMISSES \n26 the Complaint in its entirety, but  GRANTS LEAVE TO AMEND  so that the City  \n27 may attempt to excise any allegations related to WaMu’s lending practices. \n28 / / /   \n \n13\n\n  \n1 V.  CONCLUSION \n2 For the reasons discussed above, the Court  GRANTS Defendants’ Motion  to \n3 Dismiss  WITH LEAVE TO AM END.  (ECF No. 28.)  The Cit y shall file an \n4 amended complaint no later than 21 days from the date of this Order. \n5   IT IS SO ORDERED.   \n6           \n7 August 5, 2014 \n8  \n9            ____________________________________ \n                     OTIS D.

In accordance with Local \n4  Rule 7-19.1, the City conferred with Robert M. Swerdlow, counsel for JPMorgan \n5  Chase & Co.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A., \n6  (“JPMorgan”) on August 5, 2015, via telephone and provided notice of the City’s \n7  intent to seek ex parte relief.  See Declaration of Elaine Byszewski in support of \n8  Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application to Stay Case Pending Appeal of Related Action \n9  (“Byszewski Decl.”), ¶ 10.  Mr. Swerdlow’s contact information is as follows:  Robert \n10  M. Swerdlow, O’Melveny & Myers LLP, 400 South Hope Street, Los Angeles, CA \n11  90071, and Telephone:  (213) 430-6482, Email: RSwerdlow@omm.com.  \n12  Mr. Swerdlow informed the City that JPMorgan will oppose the City’s request.  Id. \n13  Three related actions brought by the City have been pending before this Court:  \n14  City of Los Angeles v. Wells Fargo & Company, et al., No. 2:13-cv-09007-ODW \n15  (RZx) (“the Wells Fargo action”); City of Los Angeles v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., et \n16  al., No. 2:14-cv-04168-ODW (RZx) (“the JPMorgan action”); and City of Los \n17  Angeles v. Citigroup, Inc., et al., No. 2:13-cv-09009-ODW (RZx) (“the Citi action”).1  \n18  On July 17, 2015, this Court entered summary judgment against the City in the Wells \n19  Fargo action. See ECF Dkt. No. 116. \n20  On July 20, 2015, JPMorgan requested that the City dismiss the case against it, \n21  because JPMorgan wanted to avoid the expense of filing a summary judgment motion \n22  similar to the one filed in the Wells Fargo action – a “me-too” motion, as counsel for \n23  the bank put it.  Byszewski Decl., ¶ 2.  JPMorgan also threatened to seek attorneys’ \n24  fees if the City did not dismiss its case outright and give up its appellate interests.  Id., \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n1 In addition to the three related cases before this Court, an additional related case entitled City of \nLos Angeles v. Bank of America Corporation, et al., No. 12:13-cv-09046-PA-AGR (“the Bank of \n27 \nAmerica action”) was pending in the Central District before Judge Percy Anderson, and the City is \nnow appealing the entry of summary judgment against it based on inadequate Article III standing. \n28 \n- 1 -\nPLAINTIFF’S EX PARTE APPLICATION TO STAY \nCASE PENDING APPEAL OF RELATED ACTION \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 66   Filed 08/06/15   Page 3 of 7   Page ID #:793\n \n1  ¶ 3.   On July 29, 2015, the City filed an appeal of the Wells Fargo action to the Ninth \n2  Circuit.  See ECF Dkt. No. 117. \n3  On July 30, 2015, the City declined JPMorgan’s proposal that the City dismiss \n4  the JPMorgan action; instead, the City proposed to JPMorgan that the parties stipulate \n5  to a stay of the JPMorgan action pending the City’s appeal of the Wells Fargo action.  \n6  Byszewski Decl., ¶ 4.  The City agrees that issues decided by this Court in the Wells \n7  Fargo action may very well dispose of the JPMorgan action.  Id., ¶ 5.  And the City \n8  shares JPMorgan’s interest in avoiding the inefficiency and wasted time and expense \n9  of a me-too summary judgment motion, but wants to preserve its appellate interests.  \n10  Id.,  ¶ 6.  On July 30, 2015, JPMorgan declined to enter into the stipulation, instead \n11  stating that it will seek summary judgment on grounds “substantially similar” to those \n12  argued in the Wells Fargo action and the Bank of America action.  Id., ¶ 7. \n13  Thus, to avoid wasting the resources of the Court and the parties in re-litigating \n14  issues already decided in the Wells Fargo action, the City respectfully requests that the \n15  Court stay the JPMorgan action pending the outcome of the City’s appeal of the Wells \n16  Fargo action.  “[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in \n17  every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time \n18  and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.”  Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. \n19  248, 254 (1936).  “In determining whether to stay proceedings, the district court \n20  should consider three factors: (1) conserving judicial resources and avoiding dupli-\n21  cative litigation; (2) hardship and inequity to the moving party if the action is not \n22  stayed; and (3) potential prejudice to the non-moving party if the action is stayed.”  \n23  Blalock v. DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., 2011 WL 6217540, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 14, \n24  2011) (citing Rivers v. Walt Disney Co., 980 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (C.D. Cal. 1997)).2  \n25  All of these factors weigh in favor of a stay here. \n26 \n                                                 \n27  2 In City of Miami v. JPMorgan, No. 1:14-CV-22205-WPD (S.D. Fla.), the district court granted \na stay of Miami’s action against JPMorgan pending appeal of related actions brought against other \n28  banks, over JPMorgan’s objection, because “a stay can avoid wasting the time and energy of the parties \n- 2 -\nPLAINTIFF’S EX PARTE APPLICATION TO STAY \nCASE PENDING APPEAL OF RELATED ACTION \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 66   Filed 08/06/15   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:794\n \n1  Moreover, the City seeks this relief on an ex parte basis, because JPMorgan \n2  intends to file its me-too motion for summary judgment on August 14, 2015, which \n3  means the parties will already be briefing that motion before this request for a stay – if \n4  now brought as a noticed motion – would be heard in the normal course.  Byszewski \n5  Decl., ¶¶ 9, 12.  If a noticed motion were filed today, it would not be heard until \n6  September 14, 2015, within days of the City’s opposition being due on September 18.3  \n7  Id., ¶ 13.  And much like opposing the summary judgment motion brought in the Wells \n8  Fargo action, preparing the summary judgment opposition papers in the JPMorgan \n9  action is likely to take over a hundred hours of attorney time and considerable expert \n10  expense, to create a record for purposes of appeal that is substantially similar to the \n11  record in the Wells Fargo action.  Id., ¶ 14.  Thus, the avoidance of both “duplicative \n12  litigation” and “hardship and inequity” to the City in unnecessarily opposing the me-\n13  too motion warrants entry of a stay at this time.  Rivers, 980 F. Supp. at 1360. \n14  And ex parte relief is particularly important here because JPMorgan has \n15  indicated that it will seek attorneys’ fees from the City in bringing its me-too summary \n16  judgment motion – although the City is willing to stay the JPMorgan action pending \n17  appeal of the Wells Fargo action – because the City did not agree to dismiss its case \n18  against JPMorgan.  Byszewski Decl., ¶¶ 9, 15.  But the City should not be expected to \n19  waive application in the JPMorgan action of any favorable Ninth Circuit ruling the \n20  City may obtain from appeal of the Wells Fargo action.  And JPMorgan may have \n21  already begun to incur such attorneys’ fees in preparing for its August 14 filing. \n22  JPMorgan opposes the stay because it does not want to wait for appeal of the \n23  Wells Fargo action for the case against it to be resolved, id., ¶ 9, but it will have to \n24  wait for an appeal, whether of the Wells Fargo action or its own.  So JPMorgan will \n25 \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n26  and the court, since determinations by the Eleventh Circuit could alter the course of this action or confirm \nthat dismissal is warranted without further litigation.”  See ECF No. 38 (Oct. 9, 2014). \n27 \n3  The City has proposed to JPMorgan that its opposition be due this day; JPMorgan proposed \nSeptember 4, and the parties continue to negotiate a briefing schedule. \n28 \n- 3 -\nPLAINTIFF’S EX PARTE APPLICATION TO STAY \nCASE PENDING APPEAL OF RELATED ACTION \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 66   Filed 08/06/15   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #:795\n \n1  suffer no prejudice based on the time for appeal of the Wells Fargo action.  Id., ¶ 16.  \n2  And a me-too appeal would waste the resources of the parties and the judicial system, \n3  just as a me-too summary judgment motion would waste such resources.  Id. \n4  For these reasons, the City respectfully requests that the Court stay the \n5  JPMorgan action pending the Ninth Circuit’s resolution of the City’s appeal of the \n6  Wells Fargo action. \n7 \nDATED:  August 6, 2015   \n8  By: /s/ Elaine T.

Disclosure and discovery activity in this Litigation are likely to involve \n8  production of confidential, proprietary, or private information of the parties and \n9  third-parties for which special protection from public disclosure and from use for any \n10  purpose other than prosecuting this Litigation is warranted.  The unrestricted \n11  disclosure of such information would cause undue damage to the parties, their \n12  businesses, and third-parties.  Accordingly, the parties in this action hereby stipulate \n13  to and petition the Court to enter the following Protective Order.  The parties \n14  acknowledge that this Order does not confer blanket protections on all disclosures or \n15  responses to discovery, and that the protections outlined herein extend only to the \n16  limited information or items that are entitled to treatment as confidential under \n17  applicable legal principles. \n18  2.  The parties further acknowledge, as set forth in paragraph 16, that this \n19  Protective Order creates no entitlement to file Confidential Information, as defined in \n20  paragraph 4, under seal.  Local 79-5.1 and the Pilot Project for the Electronic \n21  Submission and Filing of Under Seal Documents for the Central District of \n22  California, where applicable, set forth the procedures that must be followed, and \n23  reflect the standards that will be applied, when a party seeks permission from the \n24  Court to file material under seal. \n25  3.  This Order shall govern all materials produced as part of a party’s Initial \n26  Disclosures under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1), produced in connection \n27  with this Litigation, or produced in response to any discovery request in the \n28 \n  - 1 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  Litigation (including, but not limited to, documents, deposition transcripts, \n2  interrogatory responses, and responses to requests for admission) to any party or \n3  non-party subpoena; all information contained in those materials; and all copies, \n4  excerpts, or summaries of those materials (collectively, “Discovery Materials”).   \n5  DESIGNATING CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL \n6  4.  Any party or non-party may designate as confidential (by stamping the \n7  relevant page “Confidential” or as otherwise set forth herein) any Discovery \n8  Materials which that party or non-party (“Designating Party”) considers in good faith  \n9  are confidential because they include any of the following: (a) individual personal \n10  information that is protected from disclosure under state or federal law (including \n11  identifying personal financial information); (b) trade secrets; (c) confidential \n12  financial information that, if disclosed to the general public or competitors of the \n13  Designating Party, could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable, significant \n14  harm to the Designating Party; (d) confidential underwriting and pricing models or \n15  criteria; (e) competitive compensation structures or information regarding individual \n16  employee compensation; or (f) information that the Designating Party has a duty to a \n17  third-party or to the court to maintain as confidential (collectively, “Confidential \n18  Information”).  The parties respectfully submit that good cause exists to protect these \n19  narrow categories of information as confidential.  See, e.g., Foltz v. State Farm Mut. \n20  Auto. Ins. Co., 331 F.3d 1122, 1134 (9th Cir. 2003) (protective order appropriate to \n21  protect “trade secrets, financial information, and third-party medical or personnel \n22  information”); Humboldt Baykeeper v. Union Pac. R. Co., 244 F.R.D. 560, 563 \n23  (N.D. Cal. 2007) (protective order appropriate where “disclosure … would cause an \n24  identifiable, significant harm”); Duling v. Gristede’s Operating Corp., 266 F.R.D. \n25  66, 73 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (protective order appropriate to protect individuals’ personal \n26  information); Star Scientific, Inc. v. Carter, 204 F.R.D. 410, 415-16 (S.D. Ind. 2001) \n27  (protective order appropriate to protect “trade secrets and confidential information” \n28 \n  - 2 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  the “public dissemination” of which would cause “great economic harm”).  The \n2  parties also respectfully note that this showing of good cause is identical to that in \n3  the entered protective order in the related lawsuit, City of Los Angeles v. Wells Fargo \n4  & Co. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 13-cv-09007-ODW (RZx), in the Central \n5  District of California. \n6  5.  Where a document or response consists of more than one page, the first \n7  page and each page on which Confidential Information appears shall be so \n8  designated.  The parties agree, however, that confidentiality designations initially \n9  may be made at the document level, not the page level (each page of any documents \n10  so designated shall still be stamped “Confidential”).  If a party challenges all or any \n11  part of the confidentiality designation with respect to any Discovery Materials, or if a \n12  party provides notice that it intends to file any Discovery Materials, the Designating \n13  Party shall re-designate such Discovery Materials, as appropriate to address the non-\n14  disclosing party’s challenge or notice, on a page-by-page basis with respect to any \n15  portion to be designated “Confidential.”  If the Designating Party does not re-\n16  designate such Discovery Materials on a page-by-page basis within 15 business days \n17  of receiving the non-disclosing party’s challenge or notice of intent to file, then the \n18  confidentiality designation shall be deemed withdrawn.  If a party is producing a \n19  large volume of multi-page consumer loans documents likely to contain Confidential \n20  Information, in circumstances in which it may impose an undue burden to conduct a \n21  page-by-page or document-by-document review for Confidential Information, the \n22  Designating Party may designate all such documents as Confidential, subject to \n23  challenge and notice as set forth herein.   \n24  6.  The Designating Party may designate information disclosed by it during \n25  a deposition or in response to written discovery as “Confidential” by so indicating in \n26  said responses or on the record at the deposition.  Additionally the Designating Party \n27  may designate in writing, within 30 days after service of said responses or receipt of \n28 \n  - 3 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  the deposition transcript for which the designation is proposed, that specific pages of \n2  the transcript and/or specific responses be treated as Confidential Information.  Any \n3  other party may object to such proposal, in writing or on the record.  Deposition \n4  transcripts shall be treated in their entirety as Confidential Information for 30 days \n5  after receipt, unless a motion is due to be filed, in which case the 30-day period \n6  expires five days prior to the motion filing deadline.  If a transcript is received within \n7  five days prior to a motion filing deadline, the transcript shall be treated as \n8  Confidential Information until two court days prior to the motion filing deadline.  All \n9  parties shall affix the Confidential legend required by paragraph 4 on each page of \n10  the deposition transcript designated Confidential Information at the deposition or by \n11  subsequent written notice.   \n12  7.  In the event that a party believes that any Discovery Materials produced \n13  by a Designating Party contain its own Confidential information, such party (the \n14  “Designating Party”) may request, by notice in writing to the parties, that such \n15  documents be considered Confidential under the terms of this Protective Order.  \n16  Absent any challenges to said request, such documents shall be considered so \n17  designated.  Any challenges to such designation shall follow the procedure outlined \n18  below and shall in all respects be considered as if the Designating Party produced the \n19  material in the first instance with the designation.  \n20  8.  To the extent that information stored or recorded in the form of \n21  electronic or magnetic media (including information, files, databases, or programs \n22  stored on any digital or analog machine-readable device, computers, discs, networks \n23  or tapes) (“computerized material”) is produced in a native or other form such that it \n24  cannot be stamped as described in the preceding paragraphs, the Designating Party \n25  may designate such matter as Confidential by cover letter referring generally to such \n26  matter and by labeling such media accordingly.  \n27 \n28 \n  - 4 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  9.  If it comes to a Designating Party’s attention that information or items \n2  that it designated for protection do not qualify for protection at all, the Designating \n3  Party must promptly notify all other parties that it is withdrawing the mistaken \n4  designation. \n5  10.  A party or non-party’s inadvertent failure to timely designate any \n6  Discovery Materials as Confidential Information does not waive a party’s right to \n7  secure protection under this Order for such material.  At any time, the Designating \n8  Party may designate Discovery Materials as Confidential Information by providing \n9  written notice to the receiving party.  Upon receiving notification of the designation, \n10  the receiving party must make reasonable efforts to assure that the Confidential \n11  Information is treated in accordance with the provisions of this Order going forward. \n12  11.  A party or non-party’s failure to designate Discovery Materials as \n13  Confidential Information does not constitute forfeiture of a claim of confidentiality \n14  as to any other Discovery Materials. \n15  NONDISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n16  12.  Except with the prior written consent of the Designating Party, or as \n17  otherwise permitted pursuant to this Protective Order, Discovery Materials \n18  designated Confidential Information shall only be used for the purpose of this \n19  Litigation, the related lawsuit brought against Defendants in the Central District of \n20  California by the Los Angeles Unified School District (No. 14-cv-7369), and any \n21  lawsuit that the Court formally relates to this action (“Related Litigation”), including \n22  any direct appeals from such lawsuits, and not for any other present or future \n23  disputes, proceedings or litigation, or any other business, commercial, competitive, \n24  personal, private, public, or other purpose whatsoever.  Should additional litigation \n25  be filed against Defendants that a party believes should also be designated as related \n26  litigation in which Confidential Information may be used, the parties will meet and \n27  confer in good faith regarding the issue. \n28 \n  - 5 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  PERMISSIBLE DISCLOSURES \n2  13.  Discovery Materials designated Confidential Information in accordance \n3  with the terms of this Protective Order shall not be disclosed to any person other than \n4  the following, and only to the extent necessary in connection with this Litigation or \n5  Related Litigation, as defined in paragraph 12: \n6  a.  counsel for the parties to this Litigation or Related Litigation, \n7  including in-house counsel, co-counsel, and their associated attorneys, paralegals, \n8  and other professional personnel provided they are assisting such counsel with this \n9  Litigation or Related Litigation, are under the supervision or control of such counsel, \n10  and who have been advised by such counsel of their obligations hereunder; \n11  b.  persons or entities that provide litigation support services (e.g., \n12  photocopying; e-discovery processing and hosting vendors; videotaping; translating; \n13  preparing exhibits or demonstrations; organizing, storing, or retrieving data in any \n14  form or medium; etc.) and their employees and subcontractors, provided they are \n15  assisting with this Litigation or Related Litigation, and have been advised by such \n16  counsel of their obligation hereunder; \n17  c.  any officer, employee, or contractor of a party, to the extent \n18  deemed necessary by counsel for the prosecution or defense of this Litigation or \n19  Related Litigation; \n20  d.  outside consultants or expert witnesses retained or consulted in \n21  connection with this Litigation or Related Litigation and individuals employed or \n22  engaged by them, provided that each such person shall execute a copy of the \n23  certification annexed to this Protective Order as Exhibit A before being shown or \n24  given any Confidential Information; \n25  e.  other witnesses who may testify at a deposition, hearing, or at \n26  trial, provided that such witnesses shall execute a copy of the certification annexed to \n27 \n28 \n  - 6 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  this Protective Order as Exhibit A before being shown or given any Confidential \n2  Information; \n3  f.  an officer before whom a deposition is taken, including \n4  stenographic reports and any necessary secretarial, clerical, or other personnel of \n5  such officer; \n6  g.  the original authors or recipients of the Confidential Information;  \n7  h.  the Court, court personnel, and court reporters; and \n8  i.  any other person provided that (i) the Designating Party has \n9  consented in writing to disclosure to such other person(s) and (ii) such person(s) \n10  shall execute a copy of the certification annexed to this Protective Order as Exhibit A \n11  before being shown or given any Confidential Information. \n12  RESOLVING DISPUTED CLASSIFICATIONS \n13  14.   Should a party wish to object to a confidential designation of any \n14  Discovery Materials (the “Objecting Party”), the Objecting Party shall notify the \n15  Designating Party in writing of the basis for the dispute (the “Designation \n16  Objection”).  In its Designation Objection, the Objecting Party shall particularly \n17  identify the specific Discovery Materials as to which the designation is disputed (i.e., \n18  by document bates numbers, deposition transcript page and line reference, or other \n19  means sufficient to locate such materials).   \n20  a)  Within 10 business days of receiving the Designation Objection, \n21  the Designating Party and the Objecting Party shall meet and confer in good faith to \n22  attempt to resolve the dispute without involvement of the Court.   \n23  b)  If no resolution is reached, this Order shall be without prejudice \n24  to the right of the parties (i) to bring before the Court through a jointly filed \n25  stipulation, pursuant to Local Rules 37-1 and 37-2 governing discovery disputes, at \n26  any time the question of whether any particular document or information is \n27  confidential or whether its use should be restricted or (ii) to present a motion to the \n28 \n  - 7 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  Court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) for a separate protective order as to any particular \n2  document or information, including restrictions differing from those as specified \n3  herein.  This Order shall not be deemed to prejudice the parties in any way in any \n4  future application for modification of this Order.  \n5  c)  Pending a ruling by the Court, the disputed designation shall \n6  continue to be treated as Confidential Information under the terms of this Protective \n7  Order.  Nothing in this Protective Order shall be deemed to prevent the Designating \n8  Party from arguing during the determination process for limits on the use or manner \n9  of dissemination of Discovery Materials that is found to no longer constitute \n10  Confidential Information. \n11  SUBPOENA BY OTHER COURTS OR AGENCIES \n12  15.  If at any time any Confidential Information is subpoenaed by a court, \n13  administrative or legislative body, or by any other person or entity purporting to have \n14  authority to require the production of such information, the person to whom the \n15  subpoena is directed shall give written notice thereof to the Designating Party within \n16  five business days.  After receipt of the notice specified under this paragraph, the \n17  person seeking to maintain confidentiality shall have the sole responsibility for \n18  obtaining any order it believes necessary to prevent disclosure of the Confidential \n19  Information that has been subpoenaed.  If the person seeking to maintain \n20  confidentiality does not move for a protective order or other legal intervention within \n21  the time allowed for production by the subpoena (or within such time as a court may \n22  direct or as may be agreed upon between the designating person and the subpoenaing \n23  party) and give written notice of such action to the subpoenaing party and the person \n24  to whom the subpoena is directed, the person to whom the subpoena or other request \n25  is directed may commence production in response thereto. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  - 8 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  FILING DOCUMENTS UNDER SEAL \n2  16.  No Confidential Information shall be filed in the public record without \n3  the written permission of the Designating Party, or a court’s order.  The parties shall \n4  comply with L.R. 79-5.1 and the Pilot Project for the Electronic Submission and \n5  Filing of Under Seal Documents for the Central District of California, where \n6  applicable. \n7  17.  Copies of any pleading, brief, or other Discovery Materials containing \n8  Confidential Information which are served on opposing counsel shall be delivered in \n9  a sealed envelope stamped: \n10  CONFIDENTIAL PURSUANT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER \n11  and shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Protective Order. \n12  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AT TRIAL OR HEARINGS \n13  18.  The restrictions, if any, that will govern the use of Confidential Material \n14  at trial or hearings, will be determined at a later date by the Court, in consultation \n15  with the parties. \n16  INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n17  19.  If a party or its counsel inadvertently discloses Confidential Information \n18  to persons who are not authorized, pursuant to this Order, to use or possess the \n19  Confidential Information, the party who inadvertently disclosed the Confidential \n20  Information shall (i) provide prompt written notice of the disclosure to the \n21  Designating Party upon learning of its inadvertent disclosure; and (ii) seek the \n22  immediate return of the Confidential Information from the unauthorized party in \n23  possession of the Confidential Information or secure their agreement to abide by the \n24  protections of this Order. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  - 9 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  ACTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF \n2  PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION \n3  20.  In the event that the Court determines that there is an actual or \n4  threatened breach of this Order by a party who received Confidential Information \n5  that contains personally identifiable information (e.g., private contact information, \n6  personally identifiable financial information, etc.), the parties agree that the \n7  Designating Party would not have an adequate remedy at law regarding the \n8  unauthorized disclosure of such personally identifiable information and would be \n9  entitled to specific performance, and/or injunctive relief, to enforce the terms of this \n10  Order, in addition to any other remedy the party may be entitled at law or in equity. \n11  NON-TERMINATION \n12  21.  All provisions of this Protective Order restricting the communication or \n13  use of Confidential Information shall continue to be binding after the conclusion of \n14  this Litigation.  Upon the conclusion of the Litigation, including any appeals, a party \n15  in the possession of Confidential Information, other than that which is contained in \n16  pleadings, correspondence, work product, and deposition transcripts, shall either (a) \n17  return such documents no later than 60 days after conclusion of this action to counsel \n18  for the Designating Party, or (b) destroy such documents within 60 days, and certify \n19  in writing to the Designating Party that the documents have been destroyed.  \n20  Notwithstanding this provision, counsel are entitled to retain an archival copy of all \n21  pleadings, motion papers, transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence, or attorney \n22  work product, even if such materials contain Confidential Information.  Any such \n23  archival copies that contain or constitute Confidential Information remain subject to \n24  this Order for so long as the copies are maintained.  If any Confidential Information \n25  has been furnished under this Order to any expert or other third-party, counsel for the \n26  party furnishing the Confidential Information shall request in writing that all such \n27  Confidential Information, other than that which is contained in pleadings, \n28 \n  - 10 - \n[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER ON STPIULATION  \nREGARDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION \n\n \n1  correspondence, work product, and deposition transcripts, be returned to counsel or \n2  destroyed. \n3  MODIFICATION PERMITTED \n4  22.  Nothing in this Protective Order shall prevent any party or other person \n5  from seeking modification of this Protective Order. \n6  NO WAIVER OF OBJECTIONS \n7  23.  Nothing in this Protective Order shall constitute a waiver of a party’s \n8  right to object to any Discovery Materials on any grounds or to object to the \n9  admission in evidence of Discovery Materials at any motion hearing or trial.  \n10  Nothing in this Protective Order shall be deemed to expand or limit the permissible \n11  scope of discovery in this Litigation. \n12  RESPONSIBILITY OF ATTORNEYS \n13  24.  The counsel for the parties are responsible for employing reasonable \n14  measures, consistent with this Protective Order, to control duplication of, access to, \n15  and distribution of copies of Confidential Information. \n16  25.  The counsel for the parties are responsible for administering and \n17  keeping the executed original copy of Exhibit A pursuant to ¶¶ 10(d), (e), (f), and (i) \n18  above. \n19  SHIPPING PROTECTED MATERIAL \n20  26.

ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ \n15 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.;  MOTION TO DISMISS \n16 JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A.;  PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED \n17 CHASE MANHATTAN BANK USA,  COMPLAINT [43] \n18 N.A., \n19       Defendants. \n20 I.  INTRODUCTION \n21   Before the Court is Defendants JPMorgan Chase & Co.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, \n22 N.A;  and  Chase  Manhattan  Bank  USA,  N.A’s  (collectively,  “Chase”)  Motion  to \n23 Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.  (ECF No. 43.)  This action is one of \n24 four cases brought by Plaintiff the City of Los Angeles (“the City”) against large \n25 lending institutions.  The City is seeking damages under the federal Fair Housing Act \n26 (“FHA”),  42  U.S.C.  §§  3601–19,  for  lost  property-tax  revenue  and  increased \n27 municipal  services  stemming  from  foreclosures  that  are  allegedly  the  result  of \n28 discriminatory lending practices.  The present Motion largely mirrors similar motions \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 2 of 18   Page ID #:585\n  \n1 to dismiss brought in related cases.  The Court finds no reason to deviate from the \n2 rulings in the related cases.  Accordingly, for the reasons discussed below, the Court \n3 DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.1  (ECF No. 43.) \n4 II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5   The City filed suit against Chase on May 30, 2014, asserting two claims for   \n6 (1) violating the FHA, and (2) common-law restitution.  (ECF No. 1.)  This action is \n7 one  of  four  related  cases  brought  by  the  City  against  large  lending  institutions, \n8 alleging identical claims.  (City of L.A. v. Wells Fargo, No. 2:13-cv-9007-ODW(RZx); \n9 City of L.A. v. Citigroup Inc.,  No. 2:13-cv-9009-ODW(RZx); City of L.A. v. Bank of \n10 Am. Corp., No. 2:13-cv-9046-PA(AGRx).) \n11   Chase  moved  to  dismiss  the  original  Complaint,  and  the  Court  granted  the \n12 motion on August 5, 2014, finding that Chase is not liable for the conduct of the now-\n13 defunct Washington Mutual under the Federal Institutional Reform, Recovery, and \n14 Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”), 12 U.S.C. § 1821.  (ECF No. 40.)  The City \n15 was given leave to amend to excise the allegations relating to Washington Mutual, and \n16 the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed on August 26, 2014.  (ECF No. 41.) \n17   In the FAC, the City alleges that Chase has engaged in discriminatory lending \n18 practices that have resulted in a disparate number of foreclosures in minority areas of \n19 Los Angeles.  (See FAC ¶¶ 2–3.)  Specifically, the City alleges that Defendants have \n20 engaged in “redlining” and “reverse redlining.”  (Id. ¶ 4.)  Redlining is the practice of \n21 denying credit to particular neighborhoods based on race.  (Id. ¶ 4 n.2.)  Reverse \n22 redlining is the practice of flooding a minority neighborhood with exploitative loan \n23 products.  (Id. ¶ 4 n.3.)  The lengthy FAC includes a regression analysis based on \n24 Chase loans issued in Los Angeles.  (See id. ¶¶ 90–95.)  The City alleges numerous \n25 statistics based on this regression analysis.  One example is that from 2004 to 2011, an \n26 African-American borrower was 2.783 times more likely to receive a “predatory loan” \n27\n                                                           \n28 1 After carefully considering the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court \ndeems the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. \n \n2\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 3 of 18   Page ID #:586\n  \n1 as a white borrower with similar underwriting and borrower characteristics.  (Id. ¶ 91.)  \n2 Also in the FAC are confidential witness statements from former employees of Chase \n3 who describe how minority borrowers were treated differently than white borrowers in \n4 the loan process.  (See id. ¶¶ 58–82.) \n5   Based on publically available loan data, the City alleges that it has identified \n6 947 discriminatory loans issued by Chase in Los Angeles that resulted in the start of \n7 foreclosure proceedings.  (Id. ¶ 134.)  The City expects that number to rise during the \n8 course of discovery.  (Id. ¶ 134 n.42.)  According to the City, the discriminatory loans \n9 issued by Chase were more likely to result in foreclosure, which in turn diminished \n10 the City’s tax base and led to blight.  (Id. ¶¶ 119–33.)  The City is seeking to recover \n11 lost  property-tax  revenue  as  well  as  expenses  incurred  for  increased  municipal \n12 services as a result of these foreclosures.  (Id.) \n13   Chase filed the present Motion to Dismiss the FAC on September 12, 2014.  \n14 (ECF No. 43.)  The Motion is similar, if not identical, to motions to dismiss that have \n15 already  been  denied  in  the  three  related  cases.    (Wells  Fargo,  No.  2:13-cv-9007-\n16 ODW(RZx), ECF No. 37; Citigroup,  No. 2:13-cv-9009-ODW(RZx), ECF No. 47; \n17 Bank of Am., No. 2:13-cv-9046-PA(AGRx), ECF No. 50.)  Chase’s Motion is now \n18 before the Court for decision.  \n19 III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n20 A.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n21 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for dismissal of a complaint \n22 for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Article III case or controversy requirement \n23 limits a federal court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, which includes the requirement that \n24 plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims.  Chandler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \n25 Co., 598 F.3d 1115, 1121–22 (9th Cir. 2010).  When a motion to dismiss attacks \n26 subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) on the face of the complaint, the court \n27 assumes the factual allegations in the complaint are true and draws all reasonable \n28 inferences  in  the  plaintiff’s  favor.    Doe  v.  Holy  See,  557  F.3d  1066,  1073  (9th         \n \n3\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 4 of 18   Page ID #:587\n  \n1 Cir. 2009).  Moreover, the standards set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,     \n2 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009) apply in equal force \n3 to Article III standing when it is being challenged on the face of the complaint.  See \n4 Perez v. Nidek Co., 711 F.3d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir. 2013); Terenkian v. Republic of \n5 Iraq, 694 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir. 2012).  Thus, in terms of Article III standing, the \n6 complaint must allege “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to \n7 relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 \n8 U.S. at 570). \n9 B.  Rule 12(b)(6) \n10 Under Rule 12(b)(6), a court may dismiss a complaint for lack of a cognizable \n11 legal theory or insufficient facts pleaded to support an otherwise cognizable legal \n12 theory.  Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  To \n13 survive a dismissal motion, a complaint need only satisfy the minimal notice pleading \n14 requirements of Rule 8(a)(2)—a short and plain statement of the claim.  Porter v. \n15 Jones, 319 F.3d 483, 494 (9th Cir. 2003).  The factual “allegations must be enough to \n16 raise a right to relief above the speculative level” and a claim for relief must be \n17 “plausible on its face.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570.   \n18   The determination whether a complaint satisfies the plausibility standard is a \n19 “context-specific  task  that  requires  the  reviewing  court  to  draw  on  its  judicial \n20 experience and common sense.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S at 679.  A court is generally limited \n21 to the pleadings and must construe all “factual allegations set forth in the complaint     \n22 . . . as true and . . . in the light most favorable” to the plaintiff.  Lee v. City of L.A., 250 \n23 F.3d  668,  688  (9th  Cir.  2001).    But  a  court  need  not  blindly  accept  conclusory \n24 allegations, unwarranted deductions of fact, and unreasonable inferences.  Sprewell v. \n25 Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001). \n26 IV.  DISCUSSION \n27   Chase  moves  to  dismiss  the  FAC  for  lack  of  statutory  standing,  failure  to \n28 adequately allege causation, expiration of the statute of limitations, and overall failure \n \n4\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 5 of 18   Page ID #:588\n  \n1 to state a claim.  All of Chase’s grounds for dismissal are familiar to the Court, having \n2 ruled on similar motions in the related cases.  While Chase has raised some new \n3 arguments, the Court once again finds the City’s allegations sufficient to survive the \n4 pleadings stage of this litigation.2  \n5 A.  Causation \n6   The Court turns first to the issue of causation.  Chase argues that the City’s \n7 FHA claim should be dismissed because the City has failed to adequately allege that \n8 its harm—lost property-tax revenue and increased municipal services—was caused by \n9 Chase’s discriminatory lending practices.  (Mot. 18:3–22:17.)  The thrust of Chase’s \n10 causation  argument  is  that  the  connection  between  the  allegedly  discriminatory \n11 lending practices and the City’s alleged harm is too attenuated, requiring a series of \n12 speculative inferences.  (Id.)  This argument is nearly identical to those made in the \n13 related cases where this Court found that the City had adequately alleged causation for \n14 the purposes of Article III standing as well as proximate causation.  See Wells Fargo, \n15 No. 13-cv-9007-ODW(RZx), ECF No. 37; Citigroup, No. 13-cv-9009-ODW(RZx), \n16 ECF No. 47. \n17   While Chase does not explicitly refer to Article III standing in its Motion, its \n18 causation  arguments  invoke  principles  of  Article  III  standing.    A  requirement  for \n19 constitutional  standing  is  that  plaintiffs  “establish  a  ‘line  of  causation’  between \n20 defendants’ action and their alleged harm that is more than ‘attenuated.’”  Maya v. \n21 Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. \n22 737, 758 (1984)).  But a causal chain “does not fail simply because it has several \n23 ‘links,’ provided those links are ‘not hypothetical or tenuous’ and remain ‘plausible.’”  \n24 Id. (quoting Nat’l Audubon Soc’y, Inc. v. Davis, 307 F.3d 835, 849 (9th Cir. 2002)). \n25   In addition, to survive the instant Motion to Dismiss, the City must also have \n26 adequately alleged proximate causation.  See Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control \n                                                           \n27\n2 Chase filed a Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) in support of the instant Motion.  (ECF No. 44.)  \n28 The Court DENIES the RJN since it does not rely on any of the documents in its analysis.  Notably, \nneither does Chase since there is no reference or citation to the RJN in the Motion. \n \n5\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 6 of 18   Page ID #:589\n  \n1 Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1390 (Mar. 25, 2014).  A “damages action under \n2 the FHA sounds basically in tort—the statute merely defines a new legal duty, and \n3 authorizes the courts to compensate a plaintiff for the injury caused by the defendant’s \n4 wrongful breach.”  Garcia v. Brockway, 526 F.3d 456, 464 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  \n5 Accordingly, the City must allege that Chase’s “wrongful conduct was a substantial \n6 factor in bringing about the harm in question.”  Pac. Shores Props., LLC v. City of \n7 Newport Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1167–68 (9th Cir. 2013). \n8   First,  with  respect  to  Article  III,  the  Court  finds  that  the  City’s  causation \n9 allegations are sufficient.  The City relies on a regression analysis in its lengthy FAC \n10 to support its claims and theory of causation.  The regression analysis is based on \n11 publicly available loan data.  (FAC ¶ 90.)  Supporting the first “link” in the City’s \n12 causal chain—Chase’s discriminatory lending practices—are statistics such as from \n13 2004 to 2011 an African-American borrower was 2.783 times more likely to receive a \n14 predatory  loan  from  Chase  as  a  white  borrower  with  similar  underwriting  and \n15 borrower characteristics.  (Id. ¶ 91.)  As for the second “link”—discriminatory loans \n16 resulted  in  foreclosures—the  City  alleges,  for  example,  that  “a  [Chase]  loan  in  a \n17 predominantly African-American or Latino neighborhood is 5.174 times more likely \n18 to result in foreclosure as is a [Chase] loan in a predominantly white neighborhood.”  \n19 (Id. ¶ 98.)  Also, a predatory loan made to a Latino borrower was 4.339 times as likely \n20 to result in foreclosure as a non-predatory loan to a white borrower.  (Id. ¶ 108.)  \n21 These foreclosures are then alleged to have caused a reduction in property values that \n22 diminished the tax base (Id. ¶¶ 113–28) and created an increased need for city services \n23 (Id. ¶¶ 129–33), which demonstrate the final links in the City’s causal chain.  Cf. \n24 Gladstone Realtors v. Vill. of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 110–11 (1979) (“A significant \n25 reduction in property values directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax \n26 base, thus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government and provide \n27 services.”). \n28 / / / \n \n6\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 7 of 18   Page ID #:590\n  \n1   In support of its causation arguments, Chase references several district-court \n2 decisions in similar cases across the country.  (Mot. 18–20.)  The Court has analyzed \n3 these cases at length in ruling on the motions to dismiss in Wells Fargo and Citigroup.  \n4 The Court refers to and incorporates that analysis here.  See Wells Fargo, No. 13-cv-\n5 9007-ODW(RZx), ECF No. 37 at 7–9; Citigroup, No. 13-cv-9009-ODW(RZx), ECF \n6 No. 47 at 10–12.   \n7   Next,  with  respect  to  proximate  cause,  the  Court  also  finds  the  City’s \n8 allegations sufficient to meet the minimum pleading standards.  The Ninth Circuit \n9 uses the following three-factor “remoteness” test to assess proximate causation:     \n10 (1) whether there are more direct victims of the alleged wrongful conduct \n11 who can be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general; \n12 (2) whether it will be difficult to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff’s \n13 damages attributable to defendant’s wrongful conduct; and (3) whether \n14 the courts will have to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages to \n15 obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.   \n16 Oregon Laborers-Employers Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc.,   \n17 185 F.3d 957, 963 (9th Cir. 1999).   \n18   Turning  to  the  first  factor  of  Oregon  Laborers,  the  Court  finds  that  while \n19 mortgagors would certainly be more direct victims of Chase’s alleged conduct, the \n20 City’s  injuries  are  separate  and  distinct  from  the  injuries  of  the  mortgagors.  \n21 Moreover, the City alleges in the FAC that its injuries—just like the injuries suffered \n22 by  the  mortgagors—were  a  direct  and  foreseeable  result  of  predatory  lending \n23 practices.  (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 43–45, 106–07.)  Also, the City alleges in the FAC that \n24 Chase’s  contribution  to  the  City’s  harm—lost  property-tax  revenue  and  increased \n25 municipal services—can be calculated through Hedonic regression analysis, which \n26 distinguishes Chase’s conduct from other causes.  (See id. ¶¶ 123–28.)  This favors the \n27 City under the second factor of Oregon Laborers.  Furthermore, the Court also finds \n28 no danger of multiple recoveries—the third factor of Oregon Laborers.  This issue is \n \n7\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 8 of 18   Page ID #:591\n  \n1 not addressed in Chase’s Motion, but since the City’s harm is separate and distinct \n2 from the mortgagors, the Court sees no danger of multiple recoveries at this time. \n3   Since  the  Court’s  rulings  on  the  motions  to  dismiss  in  Wells  Fargo  and \n4 Citigroup, a district court in the Southern District of Florida has reached the opposite \n5 conclusion on proximate causation in similar actions brought by the City of Miami.  \n6 See City of Miami v. Bank of Am. Corp., No. 1:13-cv-24506-WPD, 2014 WL 3362348 \n7 (S.D. Fla. July 9, 2014).  Chase relies heavily on the City of Miami decision in its \n8 Motion.  But to the extent that this Court’s findings are inconsistent with City of \n9 Miami—which  applied  Eleventh  Circuit  case  law—this  Court  expressly  disagrees \n10 with that decision.   \n11   Lastly, with respect to causation, the Court finds that a large portion of Chase’s \n12 arguments delve too deeply into the merits of the case.  Pac. Shores, 730 F.3d at 1168 \n13 (“Causation is an intensely factual question that should typically be resolved by a \n14 jury.”)  For example, Chase disputes the City’s regression analysis and statistics, but \n15 these arguments are more appropriate for summary judgment or trial, with the benefit \n16 of expert opinion.  Chase is free to challenge causation throughout this litigation, and \n17 the Court expects it, but the City is not required to actually prove its claims at the \n18 motion-to-dismiss stage.   \n19   For these reasons, the Court finds that the allegations in the FAC meet the \n20 minimum pleading standards for the purposes of causation under Article III as well as \n21 proximate causation under the FHA. \n22 B.  Zone of Interests \n23   Chase argues that the City’s FHA claim must also be dismissed because the \n24 City lacks statutory standing.  Statutory standing looks at whether Congress intended \n25 to allow the City to recover for its alleged harm under the FHA.  See Lexmark, 134 S. \n26 Ct. at 1388.  It is “presume[d] that a statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs \n27 whose interests ‘fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.’” Id. \n28 (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 751).  The zone-of-interests test for statutory standing is \n \n8\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 9 of 18   Page ID #:592\n  \n1 “not especially demanding” and the benefit of the doubt goes to the plaintiff.  Id.       \n2 at 1389 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  “[T]he test ‘forecloses suit only \n3 when  a  plaintiff’s  interests  are  so  marginally  related  to  or  inconsistent  with  the \n4 purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that” Congress \n5 authorized  the  plaintiff  to  sue.    Id.  (quoting  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish  Band  of \n6 Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 132 S. Ct. 2119, 2210 (2012)).  Unlike Article III \n7 standing, statutory standing is an inquiry resolved under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Canyon \n8 Cnty. v. Syngenta Seeds, Inc., 519 F.3d 969, 974 n.7 (9th Cir. 2008); Cetacean Comm. \n9 v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1175 (9th Cir. 2004).   \n10   Here, Chase relies on Thompson v. North American Stainless, L.P., 131 S. Ct. \n11 863  (2011)  to  argue  that  the  City  falls  outside  of  the  FHA’s  zone  of  interests.  \n12 According  to  Chase,  the  FHA’s  purpose  is  only  to  provide  redress  to  victims  of \n13 housing discrimination and the City itself has not suffered discrimination.  (Mot. 4–6.)  \n14 Chase’s arguments are largely identical to the zone-of-interests arguments made by \n15 the defendants in the related cases, which this Court has already rejected.  See Wells \n16 Fargo, No. 13-cv-9007-ODW(RZx), ECF No. 37.   \n17   As in Wells Fargo, this Court relies on Supreme Court precedent holding that \n18 Congress intended standing under the FHA to be as broad as Article III standing.  See \n19 Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 372 (1982) (finding that statutory \n20 standing under the FHA is coextensive with Article III standing); Gladstone, 441 U.S. \n21 at 110 (holding that a municipality has standing under the FHA); Trafficante v. Metro \n22 Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 209 (1972) (stating that the language of the FHA is “broad \n23 and inclusive” and that Congress intended to define standing as broadly as permitted \n24 by  Article  III).    This  result  is  consistent  with  Lexmark,  which  does  not  require \n25 statutory standing to be narrower than Article III standing.  See Lexmark, 134 S. Ct. at \n26 1387–89.  Instead, the Supreme Court merely held that statutory standing is a separate \n27 inquiry that requires courts to consider congressional intent.  Id.  This Court finds that  \n28 / / / \n \n9\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 10 of 18   Page ID #:593\n  \n1 Havens Realty, Gladstone, and Trafficante considered congressional intent in holding \n2 that statutory standing under the FHA is coextensive with Article III standing. \n3   While Chase emphasizes the recent Supreme Court decision in Thompson, the \n4 case involves Title VII and not Title VIII, which encompasses the FHA.  Under the \n5 FHA,  an  “aggrieved  person”  is  defined  as  “any  person  who  claims  to  have  been \n6 injured by a discriminatory housing practice; or believes that such person will be \n7 injured  by  a  discriminatory  housing  practice  that  is  about  to  occur.”    42  U.S.C.           \n8 § 3602(i).  In Thompson, the Supreme Court interpreted the same “aggrieved person” \n9 language in the context of an employment-discrimination suit under Title VII to limit \n10 statutory standing by only allowing suit to be brought by employees.  131 S. Ct.         \n11 at 870.  Thus, Chase argues that Thompson alters the holdings in Havens Realty, \n12 Gladstone,  and  Trafficante.    But  the  Supreme  Court  explicitly  stated  otherwise.  \n13 Thompson, 131 S. Ct. at 869 (“[I]t is Title VII rather than Title VIII that is before us \n14 here  .  .  .  .”).    The  Court  in  Thompson  also  found  that  the  holding  in  Gladstone \n15 remained  consistent  with  its  analysis  of  the  “zone  of  interests”  limitation.    Id.  \n16 Therefore, the Court relies on Havens Realty, Gladstone, and Trafficante to find that \n17 the City’s claims fall within the FHA’s “zone of interests.” \n18   The City of Miami decision discussed above reached a different result on the \n19 zone-of-interest inquiry under the FHA as well.  See No. 1:13-cv-24506-WPD, 2014 \n20 WL 3362348, at *3–4.  But the Court is once again unpersuaded by City of Miami, \n21 which  relied  exclusively  on  Eleventh  Circuit  precedent  in  Nasser  v.  City  of \n22 Homewood, 671 F.2d 432 (11th Cir. 1982).  The court in City of Miami acknowledged \n23 that Nasser was the basis for its divergence from the City’s cases here.  See City of \n24 Miami, 2014 WL 3362348, at *3–4 n.2 (“Unlike the district court in City of Los \n25 Angeles, this Court is in the Eleventh Circuit so it is bound by the Eleventh Circuit’s \n26 opinion [Nasser] . . . . If it turns out that the zone of interests for the purposes of \n27 standing under the FHA is as broad as Article III standing, this court’s ruling may \n28 very well be different as to the zone of interests analysis . . . .”).  This Court is located \n \n10\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 11 of 18   Page ID #:594\n  \n1 in the Ninth Circuit and is in no way bound by Eleventh Circuit precedent.  Instead, \n2 this Court relies on precedent from the highest legal authority—the Supreme Court—\n3 to find that the zone of interests under the FHA is as broad as Article III standing.3  \n4 See Trafficante, 409 U.S. at 210 (discussing the FHA’s legislative history and holding \n5 that “[w]hile members of minority groups were damaged the most from discrimination \n6 in housing practices, the proponents of the legislation emphasized that those who were \n7 not direct objects of discrimination had an interest in ensuring fair housing, as they too \n8 suffered”). \n9   In its Reply, Chase also brings up the Ninth Circuit’s recent decision in El \n10 Dorado Estates v. City of Fillmore, 765 F.3d 1118, 1122 (9th Cir. Sept. 2, 2014).  \n11 Chase argues that the Ninth Circuit in El Dorado held “that statutory standing under \n12 the FHA is not coextensive with Article III standing.”  (Reply 2:11–14.)  But this is a \n13 mischaracterization of the El Dorado decision.  The Ninth Circuit never reached that \n14 question because it was not raised in the first instance at the district-court level.4  El \n15 Dorado, 786 F.3d at 1122. \n16   Since the Court finds that the City has Article III standing,5 the Court finds that \n17 the City also has statutory standing under the FHA.  \n18 C.  Statute of Limitations \n19   Chase also argues that the City’s FHA claim should be dismissed because it is \n20 barred by the statute of limitations.  (Mot. 22:20–23:14.)  Under the FHA, claims must \n                                                           \n21\n3 This Court also notes that the Supreme Court’s decision in Thompson—which expressly declined \n22 to limit the FHA’s zones of interests—was decided decades after the Eleventh Circuit decision in \nNasser.  See Thompson, 134 S. Ct. at 1388–89. \n23 4  In  its  Reply,  Chase  suggests  that  El  Dorado  at  least  warrants  certification  of  the  issue  for \ninterlocutory appeal.  But the Court disagrees because there is no substantial ground for difference of \n24\nopinion.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  The Ninth Circuit never weighed in on statutory standing in El \n25 Dorado, and inconsistent out-of-circuit, out-of-district decisions do not create a substantial ground \nfor difference of opinion.  See In re Thinkfilm, LLC, No. 12-cv-9795-PSG, 2013 WL 654010, at *2 \n26\n(C.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2013); Natural Res. Def. Council v. Cnty. of L.A., No. 08-cv-1467-AHM(PLAx), \n2011 WL 318543,  at *1 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 27, 2011). \n27\n5 The Court interprets Chase’s Motion as disputing only causation for the purposes of Article III \n28 standing.    But  the  Court  finds  the  allegations  in  the  FAC  sufficient  to  establish  injury  and \nredressability as well.  \n \n11\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 12 of 18   Page ID #:595\n  \n1 be  filed  “not  later  than  2  years  after  the  occurrence  or  termination  of  an  alleged \n2 discriminatory housing practice . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A).   \n3   Pursuant to a tolling agreement between the parties, the two-year limitations \n4 period in this case runs from November 25, 2011, to November 25, 2013.  (Mot. 23 \n5 n.6.)  According to Chase, the statute of limitations has run on the City’s FHA claim \n6 because the City has failed to allege any specific predatory lending activity within this \n7 limitations period.  (Mot. 22:20–23:14.)  But the City argues that the “continuing \n8 violations doctrine” applies because it has alleged an unbroken, eight-year pattern and \n9 practice  of  discrimination  with  respect  to  Chase’s  discriminatory  lending.          \n10 (Opp’n 14:18–17:6.)   \n11   The Court finds that the allegations in the FAC do not run afoul of the statute of \n12 limitations.  Where a plaintiff challenges not merely a single incident of conduct that \n13 violates the FHA, but rather a pattern or practice of discrimination, the statute of \n14 limitations  runs  from  the  last  asserted  occurrence.    See  Havens  Realty,  455  U.S.         \n15 at 380–81.  This is known as the “continuing violations doctrine.”  Id. at 380.  Here, \n16 the  City  repeatedly  alleges  that  Chase  has  engaged  in  an  “unlawful  pattern  and \n17 practice” of mortgage discrimination and that Chase has “adapted to changing market \n18 conditions”  while  continuing  to  discriminate  against  minority  borrowers  in  Los \n19 Angeles.  (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 3–4, 8–9, 136.)  Moreover, at least one of the City’s \n20 confidential witnesses, who alleges discriminatory conduct by Chase, worked at the \n21 bank from 2011 to 2012, which is within the limitations period.  (See id. ¶ 60.) \n22   Chase disputes the application of the continuing violations doctrine because the \n23 types of loans issued to minority borrowers changed over time.  (Mot. 23.)  Chase \n24 stopped issuing subprime loans by the time the limitations period began to run, and \n25 new loans issued during the limitations period—such as FHA and VA loans—are not \n26 “inherently predatory” like the previous loans.  (Id. (citing FAC ¶ 52 n.22).)  But the \n27 Court finds that while the exact type of loan issued to minority borrowers may have \n28 changed over time, the City alleges that the loans issued within the relevant time \n \n12\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 13 of 18   Page ID #:596\n  \n1 period remained high-risk and discriminatory.  (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 52 (“FHA and VA \n2 government loans are characterized as higher risk loans because they are typically \n3 more expensive for a borrower than conventional loans and include fees and costs not \n4 associated with conventional loans.”).)  The City’s allegations of discrimination under \n5 the FHA relate to Chase’s lending practices overall, not a specific type of loan issued.  \n6 The Court finds the allegations sufficient to apply the continuing violations doctrine.6  \n7 See O’Loghlin v. Cnty. of Orange, 229 F.3d 871, 875 (“[I]f a discriminatory act takes \n8 place within the limitations period and that act is related and similar to acts that took \n9 place outside the limitations period, all the related acts—including the earlier acts—\n10 are actionable as part of a continuing violation.”). \n11 D.  Failure to State a Claim Under the FHA \n12   Chase uses up considerable space in its Motion arguing that the FHA claim \n13 should also be dismissed because the City has failed to properly allege a pattern or \n14 practice of discrimination.  Chase argues that the City’s allegations are insufficient to \n15 recover under a theory of disparate treatment and a disparate-impact theory of liability \n16 is not available under the FHA.   \n17 1.  Disparate Treatment \n18   Discriminatory  intent  or  motive  is  a  necessary  element  of  any  disparate \n19 treatment claim under the FHA.  See Wood v. City of San Diego, 678 F.3d 1075, 1081 \n20 (9th Cir. 2012) (requiring allegations of discriminatory intent in a disparate treatment \n21 claim under Title VII); Gamble v. City of Escondido, 104 F.3d 300, 304–05 (9th     \n22 Cir. 1997) (holding that the elements of Title VII discrimination claims, including                  \n23 / / / \n24\n                                                           \n25 6 Chase makes an additional argument with respect to loans issued by Bear Stearns.  The City is \nseeking to hold Chase liable for loans issued by Bear Stearns at a time when Chase contends that \n26\nBear Stearns was a separate entity, and even a competitor.  Chase argues that these loans should not \nbe considered as part of the eight-year “unlawful pattern and practice” of mortgage discrimination \n27\nfor the purposes of the continuing violations doctrine.  (Mot. 23:15–24:5.)  But Chase provides no \n28 evidentiary support with respect to successor liability, or lack thereof.  This issue is more appropriate \nfor an early summary-judgment motion.   \n \n13\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 14 of 18   Page ID #:597\n  \n1 allegations  of  discriminatory  treatment,  are  the  same  as  the  elements  for  FHA \n2 discrimination under Title VIII).  \n3   According  to  Chase,  the  FAC  is  devoid  of  allegations  that  Chase’s \n4 discriminatory  lending  practices  were  intentional  or  racially  motivated.    (See         \n5 Mot. 7–14.)  But the Court finds no fault with the City’s ample allegations in the FAC \n6 under a theory of disparate treatment.  The FAC is rife with allegations that Chase \n7 targeted minority borrowers by offering unfair loan terms based on race or national \n8 origin.  (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 11, 66, 72, 74–76, 81.)  Moreover, a discriminatory pattern \n9 can be probative of motive, and the FAC contains sufficient allegations of statistical \n10 patterns of discrimination.  See Lowe v. City of Monrovia, 775 F.2d 998, 1008 (9th \n11 Cir. 1985) (stating that statistical evidence may be probative of motive).  \n12   While  Chase  attacks  the  confidential  witness  statements,  statistics,7  and  the \n13 predatory nature of the loans themselves, the Court finds that these arguments go to \n14 the weight of the evidence and not the sufficiency of the City’s pleading.  (See id.      \n15 at 9:22–13:28.)  The City will be put proof as this litigation progresses, but it is not \n16 required to prove its claims at this stage.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the City’s \n17 FHA claim under a theory of disparate treatment is sufficient at the motion-to-dismiss \n18 stage. \n19 2.  Disparate Impact \n20   Next, Chase argues that the Court should find that disparate impact is not a \n21 viable legal theory under the FHA.  (Mot. 14:26–17:27.)  Chase also argues that the \n22 City has not alleged a facially neutral policy, as required for a disparate-impact theory \n23 of liability.  (Id.)   \n24\n                                                           \n25 7  Chase  once  again  takes  issue  with  the  allegations  surrounding  the  conduct  of  Bear  Stearns.  \nAccording to Chase, Bear Stearns operated independently during much of the relevant time period \n26\nand any intentional discrimination on the part of Bear Stearns, while it operated independently from \nChase, should not be imputed.  (Mot. 11:23–12:12 n.3.)  But, as stated above with respect to the \n27\ncontinuing violations doctrine, Chase offers no evidentiary support and the Court must accept the \n28 allegations in the City’s FAC as true.  Chase can, and perhaps should, raise the issue at the \nsummary-judgment stage.  \n \n14\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 15 of 18   Page ID #:598\n  \n1   As discussed in the orders denying motions to dismiss in Wells Fargo and \n2 Citigroup,  the  Court  finds  the  plurality  opinion  in  Smith  v.  City  of  Jackson, \n3 Mississippi, 544 U.S. 228 (2005), unpersuasive on the disparate-impact issue.  The \n4 justices in Smith were squarely divided on the availability of a disparate-impact theory \n5 of liability.  Moreover, the case involved an Age Discrimination in Employment Act \n6 claim under Title VII, as opposed to an FHA claim under Title VIII.  The Ninth \n7 Circuit  has  also  explicitly  recognized  disparate-impact  claims  under  the  FHA \n8 subsequent to the Smith decision along with other circuits.  Ojo v. Farmers Grp., Inc., \n9 600  F.3d  1205,  1208  (9th  Cir.  2010);  see  also  Graoch  Assoc.  #33,  L.P.  v. \n10 Louisville/Jefferson Cnty. Metro Human Relations Comm’n, 508 F.3d 366, 392 (6th \n11 Cir. 2007); Reinhart v. Lincoln Cnty., 482 F.3d 1225, 1229 (10th Cir. 2007). \n12   After  this  Motion  was  taken  under  submission,  Chase  filed  a  Notice  of \n13 Supplemental Authority.  (ECF No. 48.)  In the Notice, Chase points out that the \n14 United  States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  very  recently  vacated  a \n15 regulation from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that provided for \n16 disparate-impact liability under the FHA.  See Am. Ins. Assoc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. \n17 & Urban Dev., No. 1:13-cv-00966-RJL, 2014 WL 5802283 (D.D.C. Nov. 7, 2014).  \n18 Moreover, the Court recognizes that the Supreme Court has granted certiorari on the \n19 availability of a disparate-impact theory of liability under the FHA.  See Texas Dep’t \n20 of  Hous.  &  Cmty.  Affairs  v.  The  Inslusive  Cmtys.  Project,  Inc.,  134  S.  Ct.  46         \n21 (Oct. 2, 2014).  But neither of these cases dictates a different result on disparate \n22 impact here.  This Court is bound by Ninth Circuit precedent on the availability of a \n23 disparate-impact theory of liability under the FHA.  See Ojo, 500 F.3d at 1208.  A \n24 district-court decision in another circuit does not alter the analysis.  The Supreme \n25 Court’s decision to take up the disparate-impact question in Texas Department of  \n26 / / / \n27 / / / \n28 / / / \n \n15\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 16 of 18   Page ID #:599\n  \n1 Housing also holds no sway over the FHA claim here, unless and until it holds that \n2 disparate-impact is not an available theory under the FHA.8 \n3   Chase also argues that a disparate-impact theory of liability requires the City to \n4 allege a facially neutral policy, which the City has failed to do in the FAC.  See \n5 Stockwell v. City & Cnty. of S.F., 749 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir. Apr. 24, 2014); \n6 Johnson  v.  United  Continental  Holdings,  Inc.,  No.  C-12-2730  MMC,  2013  WL \n7 1758760, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2013).  But the Court finds that the City has \n8 alleged several facially neutral policies.  For example, the City alleges that Chase \n9 targeted high-risk loans in neighborhoods with disproportionate minority populations \n10 and gave discretion to loan officers while incentivizing the issuance of high-risk loans.  \n11 (FAC ¶¶ 4–9, 11, 86, 96, 99, 139.)  The City also alleges that Chase abandoned \n12 meaningful underwriting review and failed to extend or maintain branch support in \n13 certain neighborhoods with disproportionate minority populations.  (Id. ¶¶ 4, 8, 11, 18, \n14 66–76,  98,  101,  105.)      These  alleged  policies  are  sufficient  at  this  stage  of  the \n15 litigation.  See NAACP v. Ameriquest Mortg. Co., 635 F. Supp. 2d 1096, 1104 (C.D. \n16 Cal. Jan. 12, 2009) (finding that the marketing of subprime loans, deployment of \n17 financial  incentives,  and  lack  of  meaningful  review  of  loan  applications  were \n18 sufficient policies for a disparate-impact claim). \n19   Overall, the Court finds that the City has adequately alleged its FHA claim \n20 under a disparate-impact theory. \n21 E.  Restitution \n22   Turning to the City’s second claim for restitution, Chase argues that the claim \n23 should  be  dismissed  because  the  City  has  not  conferred  a  benefit  on  Chase.          \n24 (Mot. 24:6–25:19.)  Chase urges the Court to reject the “externalities” approach that it \n25\n                                                           \n26 8  Chase  suggests  that  American  Insurance  and  Texas  Department  of  Housing  at  least  warrant \ninterlocutory review.  (Not. of Supp. Auth. 2:13–20.)  But the Court disagrees because the City has \n27\nsufficiently  alleged  a  disparate-treatment  claim  under  the  FHA;  thus,  an  appeal  of  the  City’s \n28 disparate-impact claim will not “materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.”  See \n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \n \n16\n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 49   Filed 11/14/14   Page 17 of 18   Page ID #:600\n  \n1 has taken in denying the motions to dismiss in Wells Fargo and Citigroup.  (Id.)  \n2 However, the Court finds no reason to diverge from its previous rulings on this issue. \n3   To seek restitution, the City must allege that Chase was unjustly enriched at the \n4 City’s expense.  See McBride v. Boughton, 123 Cal. App. 4th 379, 389 (2004). \n5 Under the law of restitution, an individual is required to make restitution \n6 if he or she is unjustly enriched at the expense of another.  A person is \n7 enriched if the person receives a benefit at another’s expense.  However, \n8 the fact that one person benefits another is not, by itself, sufficient to \n9 require restitution.  The person receiving the benefit is required to make \n10 restitution only if the circumstances are such that, as between the two \n11 individuals, it is unjust for the person to retain it. \n12 Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Durell v. Sharp Healthcare, \n13 183 Cal. App. 4th 1350, 1370 (2010) (quoting McBride).   \n14   Here, the City contends that the benefits it conferred upon Chase are the so-\n15 called “externalities”—the costs of harm caused by Chase’s discriminatory lending \n16 that the City has had to shoulder.  (Opp’n 17:19–19:8; FAC ¶¶ 129–33, 149.)  “Unjust \n17 enrichment arises not only where an expenditure by one party adds to the property of \n18 another, but also where the expenditure saves the other from expense or loss.”  White \n19 v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 97 F. Supp. 2d 816, 829 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 14, 2000).  This \n20 Court, in line with similar decisions from trial courts across the country, finds that the \n21 City has properly alleged a benefit to state a theory of recovery for restitution.

The parties in \n8 the related cases before this Court have been ordered to meet and confer on Monday, \n9 December  8,  2014.    The  Court  expects  Chase  to  formally  participate  in  that \n10 conference.9  As previously ordered, the City shall file a written status report no later \n11 than close of business Wednesday, December 10, 2014. \n12   IT IS SO ORDERED.   \n13            \n14 November 14, 2014 \n15  \n16            ____________________________________ \n                      OTIS D.

NATURE OF THE ACTION \n2  1.  It is axiomatic that banks should not make discriminatory loans.  Banks \n3  must extend credit to minorities on equal terms as they do to other similarly situated \n4  borrowers.  Banks should not target minority neighborhoods for loans that \n5  discriminate nor make loans to minorities on terms that are worse than those offered to \n6  whites with similar credit characteristics.  When banks engage in such discriminatory \n7  conduct, the misconduct has profound financial consequences for the cities in which \n8  mortgaged properties exist, and banks should be responsible for those financial \n9  consequences.  Banks should reimburse the City for lost tax revenues due to \n10  discriminatory lending.  And banks should pay the costs of repairing and maintaining \n11  properties that go into foreclosure due to discriminatory lending.  This lawsuit arises \n12  because JPMorgan breached these legally mandated obligations and foreseeably \n13  injured the City of Los Angeles. \n14  A.  JPMorgan Has Engaged in a Continuing Pattern of Discriminatory \nMortgage Lending Practices in Los Angeles Resulting in Foreclosures \n15 \n2.  This suit is brought pursuant to the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (“FHA”), as \n16 \namended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, et seq., by the City of Los Angeles (“Los Angeles” or \n17 \n“City”) to seek redress for injuries caused by JPMorgan’s1 (“JPMorgan” or “the \n18 \nBank”) pattern or practice of illegal and discriminatory mortgage lending.  \n19 \nSpecifically, Los Angeles seeks injunctive relief and damages for the injuries caused \n20 \nby foreclosures on JPMorgan’s loans in minority neighborhoods and to minority \n21 \n22                                                   \n1 Defendants collectively are referred to as “JPMorgan,” including:  JPMorgan \nChase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase, and Chase Manhattan \n23 \nBank USA, N.A.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the result of the combination of several \nlarge U.S. banking companies over the last decade including JPMorgan Manhattan \n24 \nBank, J.P. Morgan & Co., Bank One, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are also liable for residential home loans \n25 \nand lending operations acquired from, and/or sold by or through, Washington Mutual \nBank, Washington Mutual Bank F.A., Bear Stearns Residential Mortgage, Chase \n26 \nManhattan Mortgage Corporation, Encore Credit Corporation, Long Beach Mortgage \nCompany, Performance Credit Corporation, JPE Home Finance LLC, and Bravo Credit \n27 \nCorp. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 1 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 5 of 56   Page ID #:5\n \n1  borrowers that are the result of JPMorgan’s unlawful and discriminatory lending \n2  practices.  The unlawful conduct alleged herein consists of both intentional \n3  discrimination and disparate impact discrimination.   \n4  3.  JPMorgan has engaged in a continuous pattern and practice of mortgage \n5  discrimination in Los Angeles since at least 2004 by imposing different terms or \n6  conditions on a discriminatory and legally prohibited basis.  In order to maximize \n7  profits at the expense of the City of Los Angeles and minority borrowers, JPMorgan \n8  adapted its unlawful discrimination to changing market conditions. This unlawful \n9  pattern and practice is continuing through the present and has not terminated. \n10  Therefore, the operative statute of limitations governing actions brought pursuant to \n11  the Federal Fair Housing Act has not commenced to run. \n12  4.  The pattern and practice of lending discrimination engaged in by \n13  JPMorgan consists of traditional redlining2 and reverse redlining,3 both of which have \n14  been deemed to violate the FHA by federal courts throughout the country.  JPMorgan \n15  engaged in redlining, and continues to engage in said conduct, by refusing to extend \n16  mortgage credit to minority borrowers in Los Angeles on equal terms as offered to \n17  non-minority borrowers.  JPMorgan engaged in reverse redlining, and continues to \n18  engage in said conduct, by extending mortgage credit on predatory terms to minority \n19  borrowers in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles on the basis of the race or \n20  ethnicity of its residents.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently \n21  acknowledged these twin evils of mortgage discrimination and explained that both \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n2 Redlining is the practice of denying credit to particular neighborhoods based on \n26  race. \n3 Reverse redlining is the practice of flooding a minority community with \n27 \nexploitative loan products. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 2 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 6 of 56   Page ID #:6\n \n1  types of mortgage discrimination “continue to have particular significance to mortgage \n2  markets.”4    \n3  5.  Major banks such as JPMorgan have a long history of engaging in \n4  redlining throughout Los Angeles.  That practice began to change in the late 1990s, \n5  when JPMorgan adapted to changing market conditions and began to flood historically \n6  underserved minority communities with mortgage loans that consisted of a variety of \n7  high cost and abusive mortgage loan products with predatory terms as compared to the \n8  mortgage loans issued to white borrowers (reverse redlining). \n9  6.  JPMorgan’s discriminatory lending practices have the purpose and effect \n10  of placing vulnerable, underserved borrowers in loans they cannot afford.  Reverse \n11  redlining maximizes JPMorgan’s profit without regard to the borrower’s best interest, \n12  the borrower’s ability to repay, or the financial health of underserved minority \n13  neighborhoods.  Moreover, JPMorgan has averted any significant risk to itself by \n14  selling the vast majority of mortgage loans it originates or purchases on the secondary \n15  market (collectively “JPMorgan Loans”).  \n16  7.  Between 1996-2006, one category of discriminatory loan products – \n17  subprime loans – grew throughout the country from $97 billion to $640 billion.  These \n18  loans were frequently targeted to minorities.  Upon information and belief, the lack of \n19  accessible credit resulting from JPMorgan’s previous pattern and practice of redlining \n20  in the minority communities in Los Angeles created conditions whereby the Bank could \n21  easily target and exploit the underserved minority communities who due to traditional \n22  redlining had been denied credit. \n23  8.  Thereafter, following several years of issuing abusive, subprime \n24  mortgage loans throughout the minority communities of Los Angeles, commencing in \n25  or around 2007, JPMorgan once again adapted to changing market conditions while \n26                                                   \n4 Remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at the Operation HOPE \nGlobal Financial Dignity Summit, Atlanta, Georgia at pg. 10 (November 15, 2012) \n27 \navailable at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121115a.htm. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 3 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 7 of 56   Page ID #:7\n \n1  continuing its pattern and practice of issuing a variety of discriminatory loan products.  \n2  Simultaneously, JPMorgan also decided to curtail the issuance of mortgage credit to \n3  minority borrowers in Los Angeles.5  In other words, JPMorgan not only refused to \n4  extend credit to minority borrowers when compared to white borrowers, but when the \n5  Bank did extend credit, it did so on predatory terms.  This combination of reverse \n6  redlining and redlining represents a continuing and unbroken pattern and practice of \n7  mortgage lending discrimination in Los Angeles that still exists today.   \n8  9.  JPMorgan’s pattern and practice of reverse redlining has caused an \n9  excessive and disproportionately high number of foreclosures on the JPMorgan Loans \n10  it has made in the minority neighborhoods of Los Angeles.  Foreclosures on loans \n11  originated by JPMorgan are concentrated in these neighborhoods even though the bulk \n12  of JPMorgan’s lending in Los Angeles is in white neighborhoods.  A loan in a \n13  predominantly minority neighborhood is 2.190 times more likely to result in \n14  foreclosure than is a loan in a predominantly white neighborhood. \n15  10.  JPMorgan’s pattern and practice of traditional redlining has also caused \n16  an excessive and disproportionately high number of foreclosures in the minority \n17  neighborhoods of Los Angeles.  These foreclosures often occur when a minority \n18  borrower who previously received a predatory loan sought to refinance the loan, only \n19  to discover that JPMorgan refused to extend credit at all, or on equal terms as when \n20  refinancing similar loans issued to white borrowers.  The inevitable result of the \n21  combination of issuing a predatory loan, and then refusing to refinance the loan, was \n22  foreclosure.   \n23  11.  JPMorgan would have had comparable foreclosure rates in minority and \n24  white communities if it had properly and uniformly applied responsible underwriting \n25  practices in both areas.  JPMorgan possesses sophisticated underwriting technology \n26                                                   \n5 California Reinvestment Coalition, From Foreclosure to Re-Redlining (2010), at \n27  4 (available at http://www.community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-\nwealth.org/files/downloads/report-stein-gwynn.pdf). \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 4 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 8 of 56   Page ID #:8\n \n1  and data that allows it to predict with precision the likelihood of delinquency, default, \n2  or foreclosure.  The fact that JPMorgan’s foreclosures are so disproportionately \n3  concentrated in minority neighborhoods is not the product of random events.  To the \n4  contrary, it reflects and is fully consistent with JPMorgan’s practice of targeting \n5  minority neighborhoods and customers for discriminatory practices and predatory \n6  pricing and products.  It also reflects and is consistent with JPMorgan’s practice of \n7  failing to underwrite minority borrowers’ applications properly, and of putting these \n8  borrowers into loans which (1) have more onerous terms than loans given to similarly \n9  situated white borrowers, and (2) the borrowers cannot afford, leading to foreclosures.   \n10  12.  The Bank’s discriminatory lending practices are evidenced by \n11  information from confidential witness statements provided by former employees of \n12  JPMorgan (discussed further herein).  For example: \n13  a)  “If you wanted to target the Hispanic community you \nhad to have certain words in there that you’d want to \n14  use to attract [the borrowers].” Certain mortgage loan \nproducts, like negative amortization loans, were \n15  “tailored for minorities, but it was not specifically just \nfor them . . . It was easy to throw them into that \n16  [negative amortization] program and get them \napproved for that program at the one percent rate.” \n17  Loan officers did not always explain the \nrepercussions: “That’s where a lot of clients were \n18  misled. They thought it was a 1 percent fixed [rate].” \n“The [initial monthly] cost was bare minimum. But \n19  the possibilities were there that it could turn out to be \nthe worst case [scenario] for the borrowers, and that’s \n20  exactly what happened.” \n \n21  b)  “The loans just weren’t going through in that \n[minority neighborhood]. It wasn’t worth it [to the \n22  Bank] to have someone there.” \n \n23  c)  “The purpose of the [HAMP] program was to get \npeople out of these bad loans, and the banks refused to \n24  do it.  To find out “how they are discriminating, look \nat the position of the branches.  That’s going to show \n25  you.”  JPMorgan is opening “huge numbers” of \nbranches across California, “but none of this is \n26  happening in minority neighborhoods. That, in itself, \nis the biggest indication of discrimination that you can \n27  find.” “The redlining and stuff like that, that still goes \non.” \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 5 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 9 of 56   Page ID #:9\n \n1   \nd)  “The people who didn’t understand English and stuff \n2  like that” tended to face higher interest rates. “There \nwere a lot of things with which I didn’t agree” at the \n3  Bank.  “A lot of times there was no mercy,” pushing \nborrowers into foreclosure while loan modifications \n4  were pending.   \n \n5  13.  The reports of these witnesses are confirmed when Los Angeles data on \n6  JPMorgan loans is examined.  Such an examination reveals a widespread practice of \n7  discrimination.  For example, a regression analysis that controls for credit history and \n8  other factors demonstrates that an African-American JPMorgan borrower was 1.795 \n9  times more likely to receive a predatory loan than a white borrower, and a Latino \n10  borrower 1.576 times more likely.  The regression analysis confirms that African-\n11  Americans with FICO scores over 660 are 2.026 times more likely to receive a \n12  predatory JPMorgan loan than a white borrower, and a Latino borrower 1.796 times \n13  more likely. \n14  14.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of \n15  Governors of the Federal Reserve System brought an action alleging that certain large \n16  banks, including JPMorgan, engaged in mortgage lending related misconduct that \n17  induced a national foreclosure crisis.  In connection with that action, JPMorgan \n18  entered into a settlement agreement with the government pursuant to which JPMorgan \n19  will:  (a) make a cash payment of $753 million into a settlement fund for distribution \n20  to qualified borrowers; and (b) provide an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure \n21  prevention actions. \n22  15.  In 2012, JPMorgan Chase and four other large mortgage servicers agreed \n23  to a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of \n24  Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the \n25  state attorneys general.  The settlement relates to unethical mortgage origination and \n26  servicing activities similar to the activities alleged herein.  Under the settlement, \n27  JPMorgan will make cash payments of approximately $1.1 billion to 50 states (with a \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 6 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 10 of 56   Page ID #:10\n \n1  set aside to certain borrowers); offer approximately $500 million of refinancing to \n2  certain borrowers; and provide approximately $3.7 billion of additional payments for \n3  certain borrowers.   \n4  16.  The past several years have been highly profitable for JPMorgan.  \n5  According to recent press releases, the Bank generated a record amount of (i) net \n6  income ($19.9 billion) and (ii) diluted earnings per share ($5.22).

At the same time that JPMorgan achieved record financial success, the \n14 \nBank’s discriminatory practices and resulting foreclosures in the City’s minority \n15 \nneighborhoods have inflicted significant, direct, and continuing financial harm to the \n16 \nCity.  Since 2008, banks have foreclosed on approximately 1.7 million homes in \n17 \nCalifornia, and JPMorgan is responsible for a significant number of these foreclosures. \n18 \n18.  In addition to reverse redlining, JPMorgan has induced foreclosures since \n19 \n2009 by failing to extend branch support to minority neighborhoods, pulling existing \n20 \nBank support from minority neighborhoods, declining to offer refinancings or loan \n21 \nmodifications to minority customers on fair terms, and otherwise denying minority \n22 \nborrowers equal access to fair credit.  \n23 \n19.  One report6 has estimated the impact that the City of Los Angeles has \n24 \nsuffered due to discriminatory lending practices by all lenders as follows: \n25 \n26                                                   \n6 Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment and the California \n27  Reinvestment Coalition, The Wall Street Wrecking Ball:  What Foreclosures are \nCosting Los Angeles Neighborhoods (September 2011). \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 8 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 12 of 56   Page ID #:12\n \n1    Overall, Los Angeles homeowners are estimated to have \nlost $78.8 billion in home values as a direct result of the \n2 \n200,000 foreclosures for 2008-2012 alone. \n3 \n  Property tax revenue losses are estimated to be \n4 \n$481 million in the wake of the foreclosure crisis. \n5 \n  The typical foreclosure costs local governments more \n6 \nthan $19,000 for increased costs of safety inspections, \npolice and fire calls, trash removal, and property \n7 \nmaintenance.  In Los Angeles, these costs are estimated \n8 \nto be $1.2 billion. \n9 \n  Los Angeles has 79,029 homeowners underwater totaling \n10  $7.3 billion in loan value.  If banks wrote down those \nmortgages, it could pump $780 million into the local \n11 \neconomy and create 11,353 jobs. \n12 \n20.  In this action the City seeks damages for reduced property tax revenues \n13 \nbased on (a) the decreased value of the foreclosed properties themselves, and (b) the \n14 \ndecreased value of properties surrounding the foreclosed properties.  In addition, the \n15 \nCity seeks damages based on the expenditure of municipal services that will be \n16 \nrequired to remedy the blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions which exist at \n17 \nvacant properties that were foreclosed as a result of JPMorgan’s illegal lending \n18 \npractices. \n19 \n21.  Because of the multitude of analytic tools available to JPMorgan to \n20 \ndetermine the likelihood that a particular mortgage loan would result in default by the \n21 \nborrower, as well as the existence of various studies, reports, and other pertinent \n22 \nliterature specifically addressing the connection between mortgage loans and \n23 \nforeclosures, it was foreseeable that JPMorgan knew, or should have known, that a \n24 \npredatory or high risk loan issued to an African-American or Hispanic in certain \n25 \nneighborhoods in Los Angeles would result in default and subsequent foreclosure.  \n26 \nMoreover, because JPMorgan maintains numerous branch offices throughout Los \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 9 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 13 of 56   Page ID #:13\n \n1  Angeles, and has knowledge of the specific address for each loan it issued, it was \n2  foreseeable that JPMorgan knew, or should have known, of the condition of foreclosed \n3  properties corresponding to loans that it issued in Los Angeles regardless of whether it \n4  serviced the loan or subsequently sold the servicing rights to a third party. \n5  22.  According to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, “foreclosures can \n6  inflict economic damage beyond the personal suffering and dislocation that \n7  accompany them.  Foreclosed properties that sit vacant for months (or years) often \n8  deteriorate from neglect, adversely affecting not only the value of the individual \n9  property but the values of nearby homes as well.  Concentrations of foreclosures have \n10  been shown to do serious damage to neighborhoods and communities, reducing tax \n11  bases and leading to increased vandalism and crime.  Thus, the overall effect of the \n12  foreclosure wave, especially when concentrated in lower-income and minority areas, \n13  is broader than its effects on individual homeowners.”7   \n14  23.  The discriminatory lending practices at issue herein have resulted in what \n15  many leading commentators describe as the “greatest loss of wealth for people of color \n16  in modern US history.”  It is well-established that poverty and unemployment rates for \n17  minorities exceed those of whites, and therefore, home equity represents a \n18  disproportionately high percentage of the overall wealth for minorities.8  Indeed, \n19  between 2005-2009, the median wealth of Latino households decreased by 66 percent, \n20  and the median wealth of African-American households decreased by 53 percent, \n21  while the median wealth of white households decreased just 16 percent.9  As Federal \n22  Reserve Chairman Bernanke recently explained, as a result of the housing crisis, \n23 \n                                                 \n24  7 Bernanke, supra n.4 at pg. 4. \n8 Robert Schwemm and Jeffrey Taren, Discretionary Pricing, Mortgage \n25  Discrimination, and the Fair Housing Act, 45 HARVARD CIVIL RIGHTS-CIVIL \nLIBERTIES LAW REV. 375, 382 (2010).  \n26 \n9 Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, California in Crisis:  \n27  How Wells Fargo’s Foreclosure Pipeline is Damaging Local Communities (2013) \npg. 6 available at www.calorganize.org.  \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 10 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 14 of 56   Page ID #:14\n \n1  “most or all of the hard-won gains in homeownership made by low-income and \n2  minority communities in the past 15 years or so have been reversed.”10  The resulting \n3  impact of these practices represents “nothing short of the preeminent civil rights issue \n4  of our time, erasing, as it has, a generation of hard fought wealth accumulation among \n5  African Americans.”11  \n6  II.  PARTIES \n7  24.  Plaintiff City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation, organized \n8  pursuant to Article XI of the California Constitution.  The City is authorized by the \n9  City Council to institute suit to recover damages suffered by the City as described \n10  herein. \n11  25.  Defendant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan & Co.”), headquartered \n12  in New York, New York, operates under two brand names:  JPMorgan and \n13  J.P.Morgan.  The U.S. consumer and commercial banking businesses operate under \n14  the JPMorgan brand, and include its home finance and home equity loan business.  \n15  JPMorgan & Co., in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several \n16  large U.S. banking companies over the last decade including JPMorgan Manhattan \n17  Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., Bank One, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.  Upon \n18  information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that JPMorgan & Co. owns and/or operates \n19  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Manhattan Bank USA, N.A.  JPMorgan \n20  & Co.’s operates a Consumer & Community Banking segment, which includes a \n21  mortgage banking business (i.e., mortgage production, servicing, and real estate \n22  portfolios).  \n23  26.  On September 25, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision seized \n24  Washington Mutual’s (“WaMu”) assets and operations and placed them into \n25 \n                                                 \n10 Bernanke, supra n.2 at pg. 3. \n26 \n11 Charles Nier III and Maureen St. Cyr, A Racial Financial Crisis: Rethinking the \n27  Theory of Reverse Redlining to Combat Predatory Lending Under the Fair Housing \nAct, 83 TEMPLE LAW REV. 941, 942 (2011). \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 11 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 15 of 56   Page ID #:15\n \n1  receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  Pursuant to a \n2  Purchase and Assumption Agreement (“Agreement”), the FDIC later sold \n3  substantially all of WaMu’s assets and a significant amount of its liabilities to \n4  JPMorgan & Co for $1.9 billion.  The liabilities assumed by JPMorgan & Co. include \n5  the claims alleged by Los Angeles herein.   \n6  27.  Section 2.1 of the Agreement titled “Liabilities Assumed by Assuming \n7  Bank” provides as follows: \n8  Subject to Sections 2.5 and 4.8 the Assuming Bank [JPMorgan & Co.] \nChase] expressly assumes at Book Value (subject to adjustment pursuant \n9 \nto Article VIII) and agrees to pay, perform, and discharge, all of the \n10  liabilities of the Failed Bank [WaMu] which are reflected on the Books \nand Records of [WaMu] as of Bank Closing [September 25, 2008], \n11 \nincluding the Assumed Deposits and all liabilities associated with any and \n12  all employee benefit plans, except as listed on the attached Schedule 2.1, \nand as otherwise provided in this Agreement (such liabilities referred \n13 \nto as “Liabilities Assumed”).  Notwithstanding Section 4.8, [JPMorgan & \n14  Co.] specifically assumes all mortgage servicing rights and obligations of \n[WaMu]. \n15 \n \n16    28.  Section 2.5 of the Agreement titled “Borrower Claims” provides as \n17  follows: \n18    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any \n  liability associated with borrower claims for payment of or liability \n19 \n  to any borrower for monetary relief, or that provide for any other \n20    form of relief to any borrower, whether or not such liability is \n  reduced to judgment, liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or contingent, \n21 \n  matured or unmatured, disputed or undisputed, legal or equitable, \n22    judicial or extra-judicial, secured or unsecured, whether asserted \n  affirmatively or defensively, related in any way to any loan or \n23 \n  commitment to lend made by the Failed Bank [WaMu] prior to \n24    failure, or to any loan made by a third party in connection with a \n  loan which is or was held by [WaMu], or otherwise arising in \n25 \n  connection with [WaMu’s] lending or loan purchase activities are \n26    specifically not assumed by the Assuming Bank [JPMorgan & Co.]. \n  (emphasis added). \n27 \n \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 12 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 16 of 56   Page ID #:16\n \n1   29.  Los Angeles is not a borrower, it is not pursuing a derivative claim on \n2  behalf of any borrower, and is not seeking damages on behalf of any borrower.  \n3  Therefore, the exclusion for borrower claims set forth in Section 2.5 of the Agreement \n4  does not enable JPMorgan & Co. to avoid liability corresponding to claims pertaining \n5  to WaMu’s mortgage originations at issue herein.  Rather, in accordance with Section \n6  2.1, JPMorgan & Co. is liable for these mortgage originations. \n7  30.  According to JPMorgan’s 2012 10-K, “Mortgage Banking includes \n8  mortgage origination and servicing activities, as well as portfolios comprised of \n9  residential mortgages and home equity loans, including the purchased credit impaired \n10  (“PCI”) portfolio acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction.” \n11  31.  Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan Bank”) is organized \n12  as a national banking association under the laws of the United States.  Upon \n13  information and belief, its corporate headquarters are located in New York, New York.  \n14  It maintains multiple offices in the State of California and specifically in the City of \n15  Los Angeles, for the purposes of soliciting applications for and making residential \n16  mortgage loans and engaging in other business activities.  JPMorgan Bank also \n17  acquired JPMorgan Manhattan Bank USA, N.A. (“JPMorgan Manhattan”). \n18  32.  Defendant Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A. is headquartered in New \n19  York, New York.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that JPMorgan \n20  Manhattan engaged in residential mortgage lending in California and other states \n21  throughout the country. \n22  33.  The Defendants in this action are, or were at all relevant times, subject to \n23  Federal laws governing fair lending, including the FHA and the regulations \n24  promulgated under each of those laws.  The FHA prohibits financial institutions from \n25  discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, race, color, or national origin in their \n26  residential real estate-related lending transactions.   \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 13 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 17 of 56   Page ID #:17\n \n1  34.  The Defendants in this action are or were businesses that engage in \n2  residential real estate-related transactions in the City of Los Angeles within the \n3  meaning of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. § 3605. \n4  35.  Based on information reported pursuant to the Home Mortgage \n5  Disclosure Act, in addition to loans that JPMorgan originated directly, Defendants are \n6  responsible for residential home loans acquired from, and/or sold by or through, \n7  WaMu, JPE Home Finance LLC, Long Beach Mortgage Co., Encore Credit Corp., \n8  Bear Stearns Residential Mortgage, Performance Credit Corp., and Bravo Credit \n9  Corp. \n10  36.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiff alleges that each of the Defendants \n11  was and is an agent of the other Defendants.  Each Defendant, in acting or omitting to \n12  act as alleged in this Complaint, was acting in the course and scope of its actual or \n13  apparent authority pursuant to such agencies, and/or the alleged acts or omissions of \n14  each Defendant as agent were subsequently ratified and adopted by each agent as \n15  principal.  Each Defendant, in acting or omitting to act as alleged in this Complaint, \n16  was acting through its agents, and is liable on the basis of the acts and omissions of its \n17  agents. \n18  III.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19  37.  This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3613 \n20  and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, because the claims alleged herein arise under the laws \n21  of the United States. \n22  38.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because \n23  JPMorgan conducts business in this district and a substantial part of the events and \n24  omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 14 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 18 of 56   Page ID #:18\n \n1  IV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n2  A.  Background Regarding Discriminatory Loan Practices, Reverse Redlining, \nand Redlining \n3 \n39.  Prior to the emergence of subprime lending, most mortgage lenders made \n4 \nonly “prime” loans.  Prime lending offered uniformly priced loans to borrowers with \n5 \ngood credit, but individuals with lower credit were not eligible for prime loans. \n6 \n40.  Subprime lending developed and began growing rapidly in the mid-1990s \n7 \nas a result of technological innovations in risk-based pricing and in response to the \n8 \ndemand for credit by borrowers who were denied prime credit by traditional lenders.  \n9 \nAdvances in automated underwriting allowed lenders to predict with improved \n10 \naccuracy the likelihood that a borrower with lower credit will successfully repay a \n11 \nloan.  These innovations gave lenders the ability to adjust the price of loans to match \n12 \nthe different risks presented by borrowers whose credit records did not meet prime \n13 \nstandards.  Lenders found that they could now accurately price loans to reflect the \n14 \nrisks presented by a particular borrower.  When done responsibly, this made credit \n15 \navailable much more broadly than had been the case with prime lending. \n16 \n41.  Responsible subprime lending has opened the door to homeownership to \n17 \nmany people, especially low- to moderate-income and minority consumers, who \n18 \notherwise would have been denied mortgages.  At the same time, however, subprime \n19 \nlending has created opportunities for unscrupulous lenders to target minorities and \n20 \nengage in discriminatory, irresponsible lending practices that result in loans that \n21 \nborrowers cannot afford.  This, in turn, leads directly to defaults and foreclosures. \n22 \n42.  Enticed by the prospect of profits resulting from exorbitant origination \n23 \nfees, points, and related pricing schemes, some irresponsible subprime lenders took \n24 \nadvantage of a rapidly rising real estate market to convince borrowers to enter into \n25 \ndiscriminatory loans that had unfair terms that they could not afford.  Often this was \n26 \naccomplished with the help of deceptive practices and promises to refinance at a later \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 15 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 19 of 56   Page ID #:19\n \n1  date.  These abusive subprime lenders did not worry about the consequences of default \n2  or foreclosure to their business because, once made, a significant number of the loans \n3  were sold on the secondary market. \n4  43.  As the subprime market grew, the opportunities for abusive practices \n5  grew with it.  As a consequence, the federal government has found that abusive and \n6  predatory practices “are concentrated in the subprime mortgage market.”12  These \n7  practices, which in recent years have become the target of prosecutors, legislators, and \n8  regulators, include the following: \n9  a.  Placing borrowers in subprime loans even though they qualify for \n10  loans on better terms. \n11  b.  Failing to prudently underwrite hybrid adjustable rate mortgages \n12  (ARMs), such as 2/28s and 3/27s.13  After the borrower pays a low “teaser rate” for the \n13  first two or three years, the interest rate on these loans resets to a much higher rate that \n14  can continue to rise based on market conditions.  Subprime lenders often underwrite \n15  these loans based only on consideration of whether the borrower can make payments \n16  during the initial teaser rate period, without regard to the sharply higher payments that \n17  will be required for the remainder of a loan’s 30-year term.  Irresponsible lenders \n18  aggressively market the low monthly payment that the borrower will pay during the \n19  teaser rate period, misleading borrowers into believing that they can afford that same \n20  low monthly payment for the entire 30-year term of the loan, or that they can refinance \n21  their loan before the teaser rate period expires. \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n12 United States Department of Housing & Urban Development and United States \n24  Department of the Treasury, Curbing Predatory Home Mortgage Lending (2000), at 1 \n(available at http://www.huduser.org/Publications/pdf/treasrpt.pdf) (“HUD/Treasury \n25  Report”). \n26  13 In a 2/28 ARM, the “2” represents the number of years the mortgage will be fixed \nover the term of the loan, while the “28” represents the number of years the interest \n27  rate paid on the mortgage will be variable.

Failing to prudently underwrite refinance loans, where borrowers \n2  substitute unaffordable mortgage loans for existing mortgages that they are well-suited \n3  for and that allow them to build equity.  Such refinanced loans strip much or even all \n4  of that equity by charging substantial new fees, often hiding the fact that the high \n5  settlement costs of the new loan are also being financed.  Lenders that aggressively \n6  market the ability of the borrower to pay off existing credit card and other debts by \n7  refinancing all of their debt into one mortgage loan mislead borrowers into believing \n8  that there is a benefit to debt consolidation, while obscuring the predictable fact that \n9  the borrower will not be able to repay the new loan.  The refinanced loans are \n10  themselves often refinanced repeatedly with ever-increasing fees and higher interest \n11  rates, and with ever-decreasing equity, as borrowers seek to stave off foreclosure. \n12  d.  Allowing mortgage brokers to charge “yield spread premiums” for \n13  qualifying a borrower for an interest rate that is higher than the rate the borrower \n14  qualifies for and can actually afford. \n15  e.  Failing to underwrite loans based on traditional underwriting \n16  criteria such as debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, FICO score, and work \n17  history.  Properly applying these criteria ensure that a borrower is obtaining a loan that \n18  he or she has the resources and assets to repay, and ignoring them results in many \n19  loans that bear no relation to borrowers’ ability to repay them.  This allows the lender \n20  to make a quick profit from the origination, but sets the borrower up for default and \n21  foreclosure. \n22  f.  Requiring substantial prepayment penalties that prevent borrowers \n23  whose credit has improved from refinancing their subprime loan to a prime loan.  \n24  Prepayment penalties not only preclude borrowers from refinancing to a more \n25  affordable loan, but reduce the borrowers’ equity when a subprime lender convinces \n26  borrowers to needlessly refinance one subprime loan with another. \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 17 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 21 of 56   Page ID #:21\n \n1  g.  Charging excessive points and fees that are not associated with any \n2  increased benefits for the borrower. \n3  44.  The problem of predatory practices in mortgage lending is particularly \n4  acute in minority communities because of “reverse redlining.”  As used by Congress \n5  and the courts, the term “reverse redlining” refers to the practice of targeting residents \n6  in certain geographic areas for credit on unfair terms due to the racial or ethnic \n7  composition of the area.  This is in contrast to “redlining,” which is the practice of \n8  denying equal access to credit to specific geographic areas because of the racial or \n9  ethnic composition of the area.  Both practices have repeatedly been held to violate the \n10  Federal Fair Housing Act. \n11  45.  Following the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis, and after years of \n12  issuing abusive home loans in minority neighborhoods, the big bank lenders began to \n13  limit the issuance of mortgage credit to minority borrowers (i.e., refusing to refinance \n14  predatory loans).  At the same time, when the big banks did extend credit, they \n15  continued to do so on predatory terms.  \n16  V.  JPMORGAN ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATORY LENDING \nPRACTICES \n17 \nA.  JPMorgan’s Conduct Had a Disparate Impact on Minority Borrowers in \n18  Violation of the Fair Housing Act \n19  1.  Discriminatory lending results in a disproportionate number of \nforeclosures in minority areas. \n20 \n46.  Foreclosures are on the rise in many of the nation’s most vulnerable \n21 \nneighborhoods, particularly those with substantial concentrations of minority \n22 \nhouseholds.  The increase appears to stem from the growing presence of (1) non-\n23 \nconventional lending in these communities and (2) continuing discriminatory lending \n24 \npractices (e.g., steering minorities into loan products with more onerous terms – which \n25 \nhappen to be more profitable for JPMorgan). \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 18 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 22 of 56   Page ID #:22\n \n1  47.  A seminal report on foreclosure activity by Mark Duda and William \n2  Apgar documents the negative impact that rising foreclosures have on low-income and \n3  low-wealth minority communities, using Chicago as a case study.  Mr. Apgar is a \n4  Senior Scholar at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, and a \n5  Lecturer on Public Policy at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.  He \n6  previously served as the Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal Housing \n7  Commissioner at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and also \n8  Chaired the Federal Housing Finance Board.  Mr. Apgar holds a Ph.D. in Economics \n9  from Harvard University.  Mr. Duda is a Research Fellow at the Joint Center for \n10  Housing Studies.  The Apgar-Duda report has continually been cited by subsequent \n11  governmental, public sector, and private sector reports due to its clarity and \n12  thoroughness with respect to the negative impact foreclosures have on lower-income \n13  and minority neighborhoods.14 \n14  48.  This significant report highlights the foreseeability of foreclosures arising \n15  from predatory lending practices and their attendant harm, demonstrating that such \n16  foreclosures impose significant and predictable costs on borrowers, municipal \n17  governments, and neighboring homeowners. \n18  49.  Another report, by the Center for Responsible Lending, uses a national \n19  dataset to show that the foreclosure rate for low- and moderate-income African-\n20  Americans is approximately 1.8 times higher than it is for low- and moderate-income \n21  non-Hispanic whites.  The gap is smaller for Latinos, especially among low-income \n22  households, but even among low-income Latinos the foreclosure rate is 1.2 times that \n23  of low-income whites.  Racial and ethnic disparities in foreclosure rates cannot be \n24  explained by income, since disparities persist even among higher-income groups.  For \n25 \n                                                 \n26  14 See W. Apgar, M. Duda & R.

Overall, \n4  low- and moderate-income African-Americans and middle- and higher-income \n5  Latinos have experienced the highest foreclosure rates.15 \n6  50.  Nearly 20 percent of loans in high-minority neighborhoods have been \n7  foreclosed upon or are seriously delinquent, with significant implications for the long-\n8  term economic viability of these communities.16 \n9  2.  Minority neighborhoods are disproportionate recipients of predatory \nloans. \n10 \n51.  There is a substantial body of empirical evidence demonstrating the \n11 \nprevalence of reverse redlining in the subprime mortgage market.  These studies show \n12 \nthat, even after controlling for creditworthiness and other legitimate underwriting \n13 \nfactors, subprime loans and the predatory practices often associated with subprime \n14 \nlending are disproportionately targeted at minority neighborhoods.17 \n15 \n16 \n17                                                   \n15 Center for Responsible Lending, Lost Ground, 2011: Disparities in Mortgage \n18  Lending and Foreclosures (2011) (available at www.responsiblelending.org/-\nmortgage-lending/research-analysis/Lost-Ground-2011.pdf). \n19  16 Id. \n20  17 See Abt Associates, Using Credit Scores to Analyze High-Cost Lending in \nCentral City Neighborhoods (2008); Center for Responsible Lending, Lost Ground, \n21  2011:  Disparities in Mortgage Lending and Foreclosures (2011) (available at www.-\nresponsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/Lost-Ground-2011.pdf ); \n22  Center for Responsible Lending, Unfair Lending: The Effect of Race and Ethnicity on \nthe Price of Subprime Mortgages (2006) (available at \nhttp://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/rr011-\n23 \nUnfair_Lending-0506.pdf); Finance and Economics Discussion Series Divisions of \nResearch & Statistics and Monetary Affairs Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C, \n24 \nSubprime Mortgages: What, Where, and to Whom?

In general, as recently observed by the Federal Reserve in December \n2  2012, both African-American and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely (in fact, \n3  nearly twice as likely) to obtain higher-priced loans than were white borrowers.  These \n4  relationships hold both for home-purchase and refinance lending and for non-\n5  conventional loans.  These differences are reduced, but not eliminated, after \n6  controlling for lender and borrower characteristics.  “Over the years, analyses of \n7  HMDA data have consistently found substantial differences in the incidence of higher-\n8  priced lending [] across racial and ethnic lines, differences that cannot be fully \n9  explained by factors included in the HMDA data.”18 \n10  53.  African-Americans and Hispanics were much more likely to receive \n11  subprime loans and loans with features that are associated with higher foreclosures, \n12  specifically prepayment penalties and hybrid or option ARMs.  These disparities were \n13  evident even comparing borrowers within the same credit score ranges.  In fact, the \n14  disparities were especially pronounced for borrowers with higher credit scores.  For \n15  example, among borrowers with a FICO score of over 660 (indicating good credit), \n16  African-Americans and Latinos received a high interest rate loan more than three \n17  times as often as white borrowers.19 \n18  54.  In addition to receiving a higher proportion of higher-rate loans, African-\n19  Americans and Latinos also were much more likely to receive loans with other risky \n20  features, such as hybrid and option ARMs and prepayment penalties.  Disparities in \n21  the incidence of these features are evident across all segments of the credit spectrum.20 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  18 Federal Reserve Bulletin, The Mortgage Market in 2011: Highlights from the \nData Reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (Dec. 2012) (available at \nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/PDF/2011_HMDA.pdf ). \n25 \n19 Center for Responsible Lending, Lost Ground, 2011: Disparities in Mortgage \n26  Lending and Foreclosures (2011) (available at www.responsiblelending.org/-\nmortgage-lending/research-analysis/Lost-Ground-2011.pdf). \n27 \n20 Id. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 21 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 25 of 56   Page ID #:25\n \n1  55.  A 2010 Report from the California Reinvestment Coalition finds:  “[The] \n2  hardest-hit communities are racially concentrated, low to moderate income areas of \n3  African-Americans and Latinos that were saturated with high-cost, subprime lending \n4  since 2000.  Neighborhoods once redlined – where lenders refused to lend in \n5  neighborhoods of color without regard to the actual financial qualifications of \n6  residents – were flooded in the past decade with high-cost subprime loans and abusive \n7  option ARM loans.  These loans were often unaffordable and unsustainable for \n8  working class families, and inevitably led to large scale foreclosures.  In the past two \n9  years, borrowers and communities struggling to preserve their primary asset – their \n10  home – have found that banks are not willing to work with them to restructure their \n11  mortgages or to offer new loans.”21  Key findings from the 2010 Report include: \n12  (a)  In 2008, minority neighborhoods contained roughly \n63% of the housing in Los Angeles, but suffered over \n13  90% of the City’s foreclosures. \n14  (b)  While predatory and fraudulent lending helped \nprecipitate the foreclosure crisis, a wave of a resetting \n15  option ARM loans threatens to keep California \nimmobilized by foreclosure beyond 2010. \n16 \n(c)  California cities are more likely than the national \n17  average to be saturated with low documentation loans \n(e.g., stated income loans).  In Los Angeles, 74% of \n18  all loans in the sample were made with limited \ndocumentation, as compared to only 56% for all loans \n19  in the sample. \n20  (d)  Minority neighborhoods saw a dramatic decrease in \nlower cost prime loans in 2008.  The drop off from \n21  2006 to 2008 was stunning.  In Los Angeles, less than \n1/3rd as many prime loans were made available by big \n22  bank lenders in minority neighborhoods in 2008, as \ncompared to 2006.   \n23 \n(e)  In 2008, nearly one out of two African-Americans and \n24  Latinos seeking a home loan or refinance were denied, \nas compared to only about one in four whites. \n25 \n26                                                   \n21 California Reinvestment Coalition, From Foreclosure to Re-Redlining (2010) \n27  (available at http://www.community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-\nwealth.org/files/downloads/report-stein-gwynn.pdf ). \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 22 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 26 of 56   Page ID #:26\n \n1  (f)  Even though high-cost lending began to decrease \nsignificantly by 2008, when it occurred, it was still \n2  more likely to occur in minority neighborhoods as \ncompared to white neighborhoods.  The big bank \n3  lenders still were more than twice as likely to sell \nsubprime loans in minority neighborhoods in Los \n4  Angeles, as compared to white neighborhoods. \n5  (g)  In many cases, minority borrowers were overburdened \nnot only by subprime lending but by other onerous \n6  loan terms, such as prepayment penalties, yield spread \npremiums, option ARMs, and HELOCs, all of which \n7  have been conducive to foreclosures. \n8  (h)  In a March 2009 survey, two-thirds of housing \ncounselors reported that they believed borrowers of \n9  color were receiving worse foreclosure prevention \noutcomes than white borrowers. \n10 \n(i)  In the wake of the subprime meltdown, as \n11  underwriting tightened for all loans, higher cost FHA \nmortgage loans were the “only game in town” left for \n12  many new homebuyers. \n13  56.  Since 2008, as the data discussed below makes clear, there has been a \n14  shift in the types of loans issued – and not issued – by the Bank.  For example, the \n15  Bank shifted from offering new subprime loans toward issuing more Home Equity \n16  Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”) and higher cost FHA/VA loans.22  FHA and VA \n17  government loans are characterized as higher risk loans because (1) they are typically \n18  more expensive for a borrower than conventional loans and include fees and costs not \n19  associated with conventional loans, and (2) several of the government loan programs \n20  permit negative amortization.23  At the same time, in the last several years, the Bank \n21  tightened lending requirements in a manner that drastically limited the ability of \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  22 While FHA/VA loans are not inherently predatory, these loans have higher risk \nfeatures such as higher fees and higher interest rates.  When banks target minorities for \nFHA/VA loans and issue more of them to minorities, they are acting in a \n25 \ndiscriminatory manner. \n26  23 California Reinvestment Coalition, et al., Paying More for the American Dream \nVI, Racial Disparities in FHA/VA Lending (July 2012); www.fha.com/fha_loan_types; \n27 \nwww.benefits.va.gov/homeloans.\n \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 23 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 27 of 56   Page ID #:27\n \n1  minority borrowers to refinance or otherwise modify the subprime loans previously \n2  issued by the Bank. \n3  57.  A 2011 Report from the California Reinvestment Coalition found that, \n4  between 2008 and 2009, in Los Angeles, the number of conventional refinance loans \n5  made in predominantly white neighborhoods more than doubled (increasing by about \n6  200%), while conventional refinance loans declined in the City’s minority \n7  neighborhoods, where such refinancing was most desperately needed.24  \n8  58.  At the same time that conventional credit has contracted over the past five \n9  years, FHA lending has expanded dramatically.  During the subprime boom, FHA \n10  lending fell as subprime lenders targeted minority communities.  Now, with little or no \n11  subprime lending, and conventional credit restricted, FHA lending has shot up.  \n12  Overall, the share of loans with government backing went from 5% in 2005 to 26.6% \n13  in 2010.25 \n14  59.  For African-Americans, the share of mortgages used to purchase a home \n15  and backed by a government program increased to almost 80% in 2010; for Latinos \n16  the share increased to 73%.  But for whites, the share increased to only 49%.  At \n17  present, most minority borrowers cannot gain access to the conventional mortgage \n18  market, and instead, are relegated to more expensive FHA loans.26 \n19  60.  A 2012 Report from the California Reinvestment Coalition “shows that \n20  black and Latino borrowers and borrowers in communities of color received \n21  government-backed loans – insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or \n22                                                   \n24 California Reinvestment Coalition, et al., Paying More for the American Dream \n23  V: The Persistence and Evolution of the Dual Market (2011) (available at \nhttp://www.community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-\nwealth.org/files/downloads/report-crc-et-al.pdf). \n24 \n25 Center for Responsible Lending, The State of Lending in America & its Impact \n25  on U.S. Households (2012) (available at http://www.responsiblelending.org/state-of-\nlending/State-of-Lending-report-1.pdf). \n26 \n26 Center for Responsible Lending, The State of Lending in America & its Impact \n27  on U.S. Households (2012) (available at http://www.responsiblelending.org/state-of-\nlending/State-of-Lending-report-1.pdf). \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 24 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 28 of 56   Page ID #:28\n \n1  guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) – significantly more often \n2  than did white borrowers.

CW2 worked in the mortgage industry for about eight years; he worked \n4  for JPMorgan at multiple branch locations in the greater Los Angeles region as a \n5  mortgage loan originator in the 2011-2012 timeframe. \n6  64.  CW3 worked as an underwriter at the Bank’s corporate office in Los \n7  Angeles during the 2009-2011 timeframe.  She was previously employed at WaMu, \n8  where she was hired in 2002.  She worked at WaMu through the period when \n9  JPMorgan purchased it in 2009, and then she became a JPMorgan employee.  She \n10  worked as a loan modification underwriter with customers who were behind on their \n11  mortgage payments. \n12  65.  CW4 worked as a loss mitigation negotiator and underwriter at a \n13  JPMorgan branch in Los Angeles during the 2009-2010 timeframe.  He worked with \n14  customers who had missed mortgage payments, and he was responsible for making \n15  loan modifications for customers in the default process. \n16  66.  CW5 worked as a senior loan officer for WaMu in the 2003 to 2007 time \n17  frame, originating loans throughout the Los Angeles area.  During the course of his \n18  work, CW5 observed that WaMu targeted marketing materials and high-cost loan \n19  products for low-income minorities, and WaMu incentivized the sales force to make \n20  high-cost loans. \n21  67.  The CWs confirm that JPMorgan has engaged in predatory and otherwise \n22  discriminatory lending practices directly and through acquired lenders (including \n23  WaMu). \n24  1.

CW5 \n2  understood that certain mortgage loan products, like negative amortization loans, were \n3  tailored toward low-income minorities. “It was tailored for minorities, but it was not \n4  specifically just for them,” he added. \n5  69.  According to CW5, WaMu incentivized salespeople through \n6  commissions and bonuses to push applicants into negative amortization and other non-\n7  conventional loans. \n8  2.

CW3, who worked with customers who were behind on their mortgage \n10 \npayments, explained that most of these customers had received variable-rate loans that \n11 \nthey could no longer afford after the rates adjusted upward. \n12 \n71.  According to CW5, “a lot of [minorities] hold onto their cash instead of \n13 \nputting it in the bank.  That’s the client; we had a program for them. We would take \n14 \nnon-traditional credit.”  WaMu would qualify these minority borrowers for much more \n15 \nexpensive subprime loans and large negative amortization loans with extremely low \n16 \nintroductory monthly payments.  “At one point WaMu did not have a credit score \n17 \nrequirement,” he said.  “It was easy to throw them into that program and get them \n18 \napproved for that program at the one percent rate” – and loan officers and underwriters \n19 \nonly had to qualify the borrowers for the lowest monthly payment required during the \n20 \nintroductory period.  CW5 explained that loan officers did not always fully explain the \n21 \nonerous repercussions of such loans.  “That’s where a lot of clients were misled,” he \n22 \nsaid.  “They thought it was a 1 percent fixed (rate).”  \n23 \n72.  In CW5’s experience, loan officers tended to push negative amortization \n24 \nloans on low-income minorities.  He observed that many borrowers got into deep \n25 \nfinancial trouble after taking out these types of loans.  “The (initial monthly) cost was \n26 \nbare minimum” for the borrower, he said. “But the possibilities were there that it could \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 27 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 31 of 56   Page ID #:31\n \n1  turn out to be the worst case (scenario) for the borrowers, and that’s exactly what \n2  happened.” \n3  73.  JPMorgan (directly and through acquired lenders) does not properly \n4  underwrite these loans when made to minorities and in minority neighborhoods.  \n5  JPMorgan does not adequately consider the borrowers’ ability to repay these loans, \n6  especially after the teaser rate expires and the interest rate increases.  The fact that \n7  these loans would result in delinquency, default, and foreclosure for many borrowers \n8  was, or should have been, clearly foreseeable to JPMorgan at the time the loans were \n9  made. \n10  3.  JPMorgan tends to require prepayment penalties more often from \nminority borrowers. \n11 \n74.  Prepayment penalties typically make it more difficult for borrowers to \n12 \nrefinance into new and better loans.   \n13 \n75.  CW3 observed that JPMorgan tended to require prepayment penalties \n14 \nmore often from minority borrowers. \n15 \n76.  CW5 explained that WaMu incentivized sales people with big bonuses \n16 \nfor locking borrowers into loans with prepayment penalties. \n17 \n4.  JPMorgan induced foreclosures by failing to offer refinancing or \n18  loan modifications to minority customers on fair terms, and \notherwise limiting equal access to fair credit. \n19 \n77.  The CW statements show that JPMorgan induced foreclosures by failing \n20 \nto offer refinancing or loan modifications to minority customers on fair terms – which \n21 \nconstitutes a particularly egregious form of redlining, given that minority borrowers \n22 \nsought refinancing or loan modifications with respect to bad loans that the Bank \n23 \npreviously made to them.  \n24 \n78.  CW1 believes that JPMorgan adopted overly-stringent loan qualification \n25 \nrequirements that resulted in an unnecessarily high rate of refinancing rejections for \n26 \nminority borrowers.  She encountered months-long delays and very few successes \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 28 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 32 of 56   Page ID #:32\n \n1  when attempting to refinance minority customers.  She estimates that 90% of the \n2  minority borrowers who came to her branches desperate for refinancing would not \n3  qualify.  They usually did not have enough income or enough equity in their homes, \n4  she said. \n5  79.  CW1 explained that many minority borrowers who had previously \n6  received “no doc” loans were now asked to provide documentation of income and \n7  other assets, and could not.  She described seeing customers who only owed “$50,000 \n8  to $60,000” on a property worth $250,000 who could not refinance because they either \n9  didn’t have a job or did have a job but had insufficient documentation.  Many others \n10  had income but too little equity in their homes because of falling real estate values.   \n11  80.  CW1 said some of these customers were rejected even though she \n12  believed they should not have been rejected.  According to CW1, JPMorgan’s \n13  refinancing qualification guidelines became “much more conservative” than those set \n14  by federal guidelines.  “That was really heartbreaking,” she said. “Seeing people \n15  sitting there crying. … Those were kind of hard.” \n16  81.  According to CW1, borrowers who did not qualify for refinancing, and \n17  thus sought loan modifications, were essentially encouraged not to make payments on \n18  their homes at all.  She said the Bank informed them that a prerequisite for loan \n19  modification was missing payments.  This created more problems, she explained, \n20  because some of these same borrowers would follow the guidance, skip payments, but \n21  then not receive loan modifications.  After that, “they were just waiting for the sheriff \n22  to come around” and foreclose, she said.   \n23  82.  CW1 said that, when refinancing did take place in her minority \n24  neighborhood branches, it usually came with higher-than-usual interest rates that \n25  corresponded with rising LTV ratios. \n26  83.  During CW1’s employment, JPMorgan withdrew mortgage officers from \n27  both minority neighborhood branches where she worked because “it just wasn’t \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 29 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 33 of 56   Page ID #:33\n \n1  feasible to have a loan officer there,” she said.  “The loans just weren’t going through \n2  in that area,” she said.  “It wasn’t worth it to have someone there.” \n3  84.  CW2 said that JPMorgan has tightened its lending requirements since \n4  2008, making almost all loans “fully-doc’d” loans, setting higher standards \n5  (“overlays”) for refinancing than those established under HAMP.  “The banks said, \n6  ‘we’re not going to refinance you,’” he said.  “The purpose of the [HAMP] program \n7  was to get people out of these bad loans, and the banks refused to do it.  And this is \n8  still going on today.” \n9  85.  The Bank operated few, if any, branches in minority neighborhoods of \n10  Los Angeles; CW2 strongly believes that this evidenced an intentional form of \n11  minority “discrimination.”  In the last few years, it became increasingly difficult to \n12  serve minority customers given where the Bank chose to locate its branches, he \n13  explained.  To find out “how they are discriminating, look at the position of the \n14  branches,” he said.  “That’s going to show you.”   \n15  86.  JPMorgan is opening “huge numbers” of branches all across California, \n16  none of which are located in the inner city, according to CW2.  In the upper-middle-\n17  class neighborhood where he lives, JPMorgan is opening what he said appeared to be \n18  as many as seven branches, maybe more.  Another 300 are slated to open in Southern \n19  California, part of 2,000 that will be opening across the state, he said.  “But none of \n20  this is happening in minority neighborhoods,” he added.  “That, in itself, is the biggest \n21  indication of discrimination that you can find.” \n22  87.  CW2 confirmed that JPMorgan recorded minority status information in \n23  the loan application process.  CW2 believed that some of the minority borrowers he \n24  saw at JPMorgan should have qualified for refinancing, but they did not qualify for \n25  reasons that were unclear to him.  He suspected that minority status played a role in \n26  decision-making by JPMorgan on who to finance.  “The redlining and stuff like that, \n27  that still goes on.”  \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 30 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 34 of 56   Page ID #:34\n \n1  88.  CW2 explained that JPMorgan might offer some minority borrowers \n2  “subprime” refinancing, if they were ineligible for HAMP loan modifications.  Such \n3  loans typically offered interest rates that gradually increased over several years. \n4  89.  CW3 said:  “There were a lot of things with which I didn’t agree” at \n5  JPMorgan.  She said there were generally “a lot of policy changes … things that \n6  would happen that the customer wouldn’t know about.”  For example, she noted:  \n7  “Customers would send in their information and we would get it,” then documents \n8  would go missing.  “Everything was messy,” she said, due to the Bank’s “bad \n9  managers.”  As a result, she said, borrowers fell deeper behind on payments and into \n10  foreclosure.  “A lot of times there was no mercy,” she said, referring to the Bank’s \n11  practices of putting people into foreclosure while loan modifications were pending. \n12  90.  CW4 observed that JPMorgan denied minority borrowers loan \n13  modifications in large percentages in the City of Los Angeles because many who were \n14  in foreclosure under old stated-income mortgages were unable to get approved under \n15  the Bank’s new document-based income guidelines. \n16  5.  JPMorgan engages in other abusive lending practices. \n17  91.  The CW statements further demonstrate that the Bank increased the \n18  costliness of non-conventional loans at the expense of minority borrowers.   \n19  92.  CW3 estimated that about 35% of the borrowers she dealt with had been \n20  victims of unethical lending practices by JPMorgan.  CW3 also observed that minority \n21  borrowers tended to receive higher interest rates.  Addressing the type of minority \n22  borrowers that tended to face higher interest rates at JPMorgan, she said, “the people \n23  who didn’t understand English and stuff like that.” \n24  93.  CW3 also observed that smaller home loans at JPMorgan – somewhere \n25  between $75,000 and $100,000 and below – tended to come with much higher interest \n26  rates (e.g., 3%-4% higher), which inevitably impacted minority borrowers more than \n27  non-minority borrowers. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 31 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 35 of 56   Page ID #:35\n \n1  C.  Minorities in Fact Receive Predatory Loan Terms from JPMorgan \n2  94.  As discussed herein, JPMorgan’s predatory loans include:  high-cost \n3  loans (i.e., loans with an interest rate that was at least three percentage points above a \n4  federally-established benchmark), subprime loans, interest-only loans, balloon \n5  payment loans, loans with prepayment penalties, negative amortization loans, no \n6  documentation loans, and/or ARM loans with teaser rates (i.e., lifetime maximum rate \n7  > initial rate + 6%). \n8  95.  Data reported by the Bank and available through public databases shows \n9  that in 2004-2011, 26.3% of loans made by JPMorgan to African-American and \n10  Latino customers in Los Angeles were high cost, but only 7.4% of loans made to white \n11  customers in Los Angeles were high cost.  This data demonstrates a pattern of \n12  statistically significant28 differences in the product placement for high cost loans \n13  between minority and white borrowers.    \n14  96.  The following map of JPMorgan predatory loans originated in Los \n15  Angeles between 2004-2011 illustrates the geographic distribution of predatory loans \n16  in African-American and Latino neighborhoods and white neighborhoods in Los \n17  Angeles.  This map demonstrates that JPMorgan’s predatory loans are \n18  disproportionately located in minority neighborhoods. \n19   \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  28 Statistical significance is a measure of probability that an observed outcome \nwould not have occurred by chance.  As used in this Complaint, an outcome is \nstatistically significant if the probability that it could have occurred by chance is less \n27 \nthan 5%. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 32 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 36 of 56   Page ID #:36\n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15   \n \n16  97.  The fact that predatory loans involving all of JPMorgan’s loan products \n17  are more heavily concentrated in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles is consistent \n18  with the practice of reverse redlining and, upon information and belief, has contributed \n19  significantly to the disproportionately high rates of foreclosure in minority \n20  communities in Los Angeles.   \n21 \nD.  Minorities in Los Angeles Receive Such Predatory Loan Terms from \nJPMorgan Regardless of Creditworthiness \n22 \n98.  According to Discretionary Pricing, Mortgage Discrimination, and the \n23 \nFair Housing Act, 45 HARVARD CIVIL RIGHTS-CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW REV. 375, 398 \n24 \n(2010), several studies dating back to 2000 have established that minority borrowers \n25 \nwere charged higher interest rates/fees than similar creditworthy white borrowers. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 33 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 37 of 56   Page ID #:37\n \n1  99.  Likewise, according to A Racial Financial Crisis, 83 TEMPLE LAW REV. \n2  941, 947, 949 (2011), one study concluded that “even after controlling for \n3  underwriting variables, African-American borrowers were 6.1% to 34.3% more likely \n4  than whites to receive a higher rate subprime mortgage during the subprime boom.”  \n5  And another study found that significant loan pricing disparity exists among low risk \n6  borrowers – African-American borrowers were 65% more likely to receive a subprime \n7  home purchase loan than similar creditworthy white borrowers, and 124% more likely \n8  to receive a subprime refinance loan. \n9  100.  Similarly, the Center for Responsible Lending’s November 2011 Report, \n10  Lost Ground, 2011:  Disparities in Mortgage Lending and Foreclosures, stated that \n11  “racial and ethnic differences in foreclosure rates persist even after accounting for \n12  differences in borrower incomes.”  Further, the Center stated it is “particularly \n13  troublesome” that minorities received riskier loans “even within [similar] credit \n14  ranges.”  For example, among borrowers having FICO scores above 660, the incidence \n15  of higher rate loans among various groups was as follows:  whites – 6.2%; African-\n16  American – 21.4%; and Latino – 19.3%. \n17  101.  Moreover, data reported by the Bank and available through public \n18  databases shows that minorities in Los Angeles received predatory loan terms from \n19  JPMorgan more frequently than white borrowers, regardless of creditworthiness.   \n20  102.  A regression analysis of this data controlling for borrower race and \n21  objective risk characteristics such as credit history, loan to value ratio, and the ratio of \n22  loan amount to income demonstrates that, from 2004-2011, an African-American \n23  borrower in Los Angeles was 1.795 times more likely to receive a predatory loan than \n24  was a white borrower possessing similar underwriting and borrower characteristics.  \n25  The regression analysis further demonstrates that the odds that a Latino borrower in \n26  Los Angeles would receive a predatory loan were 1.576 times the odds that a white \n27  borrower possessing similar underwriting and borrower characteristics would receive a \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 34 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 38 of 56   Page ID #:38\n \n1  predatory loan.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant \n2  differences between African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and \n3  white borrowers.29   \n4  103.  The regression analysis also shows that these disparities persist when \n5  comparing only Los Angeles-based borrowers with FICO scores above 660.  An \n6  African-American borrower with a FICO score above 660 was 2.026 times more likely \n7  to receive a predatory loan than was a white borrower with similar underwriting and \n8  borrower characteristics.  A Latino borrower with a FICO score above 660 was 1.796 \n9  times more likely to receive a predatory loan than was a white borrower with similar \n10  underwriting and borrower characteristics.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of \n11  statistically significant differences between African-American and white borrowers \n12  and between Latino and white borrowers. \n13  104.  A similar regression analysis taking into account the racial makeup of the \n14  borrower’s neighborhood rather than the individual borrower’s race shows that \n15  borrowers in heavily minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles were more likely to \n16  receive predatory loans than borrowers in heavily white neighborhoods.  For example, \n17  a borrower in a heavily minority census tract (census tract consisting of at least 80% \n18  African-American or Latino households) was 2.261 times more likely than was a \n19  borrower with similar characteristics in a heavily white neighborhood (census tract \n20  with at least 80% white households) to receive a predatory loan.  These odds ratios \n21  demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant differences between African-\n22  American and white borrowers and between Latino and white borrowers. \n23  105.  This data also establishes that JPMorgan disproportionately issued \n24  government loans with higher risk features (FHA/VA) to African-American and \n25  Latino borrowers in Los Angeles from 2009-2011.  A regression analysis controlling \n26 \n                                                 \n27  29 As alleged throughout the Complaint, all references to the date range 2004-2011 \nare intended to include the time period up to and including December 31, 2011. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 35 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 39 of 56   Page ID #:39\n \n1  for borrower race and objective risk characteristics such as ratio of loan amount to \n2  income demonstrates that an African-American borrower was 2.660 times more likely \n3  to receive a higher risk government loan than was a white borrower possessing similar \n4  borrower and underwriting characteristics.  The regression analysis further \n5  demonstrates that a Latino borrower was 2.857 times more likely to receive a higher \n6  risk government loan than was a white borrower possessing similar borrower and \n7  underwriting characteristics.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically \n8  significant differences between African-American and white borrowers and between \n9  Latino and white borrowers in the City. \n10  106.  Thus, the disparities are not the result of, or otherwise explained by, \n11  legitimate non-racial underwriting criteria. \n12  E.  JPMorgan’s Targeting of Minorities who in Fact Receive Predatory Loan \nTerms Regardless of Creditworthiness Causes Foreclosures \n13 \n1.  Data shows that JPMorgan’s foreclosures are disproportionately \n14  located in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles. \n15  107.  JPMorgan has intentionally targeted predatory practices at African-\n16  American and Latino neighborhoods and residents.  Far from being a responsible \n17  provider of much-needed credit in minority communities, JPMorgan is a leading cause \n18  of stagnation and decline in African-American and Latino neighborhoods where its \n19  foreclosures are concentrated.  Specifically, since at least 2000, its foreclosures have \n20  been concentrated in neighborhoods with African-American or Latino populations \n21  exceeding 80%. \n22  108.  Although only 20.4% of JPMorgan’s loan originations in Los Angeles \n23  from 2004 to 2011 were in census tracts that are at least 80% African-American or \n24  Latino, 24.5% of loan originations that had entered foreclosure by February 2013 were \n25  in those census tracts.  Similarly, while only 36.0% of JPMorgan’s loan originations in \n26  Los Angeles from 2004 to 2011 occurred in census tracts that are at least 50% \n27  African-American or Latino, 43.3% of JPMorgan’s loan originations that had entered \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 36 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 40 of 56   Page ID #:40\n \n1  foreclosure by February 2013 were in those census tracts.  Moreover, while 39.4% of \n2  JPMorgan’s loan originations in Los Angeles from 2004 to 2011 occurred in census \n3  tracts that were less than 20% African-American or Latino, only 30.2% of JPMorgan’s \n4  loan originations that had entered foreclosure by February 2013 were in those census \n5  tracts.  This data demonstrates a pattern of statistically significant differences between \n6  African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and white borrowers.    \n7  109.  The following map represents the concentration of JPMorgan’s loan \n8  originations from 2004 through 2011 that had entered foreclosure by February 2013 in \n9  African-American and Latino neighborhoods.  In addition to the disproportionate \n10  distribution of JPMorgan foreclosures in African-American and Latino neighborhoods, \n11  disparate rates of foreclosure based on race further demonstrate JPMorgan’s failure to \n12  follow responsible underwriting practices in minority neighborhoods.  While 19.2% of \n13  JPMorgan’s loans in predominantly (greater than 80%) African-American or Latino \n14  neighborhoods result in foreclosure, the same is true for only 9.8% of its loans in \n15  predominantly (greater than 80%) white neighborhoods.  In other words, a JPMorgan \n16  loan in a predominantly African-American or Latino neighborhood is 2.190 times \n17  more likely to result in foreclosure as is a JPMorgan loan in a predominantly white \n18  neighborhood.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant \n19  differences between African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and \n20  white borrowers. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 37 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 41 of 56   Page ID #:41\n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n \n \n14 \n110.  Thus, JPMorgan’s discretionary lending policies and pattern or practice \n15 \nof targeting of minorities, who in fact receive predatory loan terms regardless of \n16 \ncreditworthiness, have caused and continue to cause foreclosures in Los Angeles. \n17 \n2.  Data shows that JPMorgan’s loans to minorities result in especially \n18  quick foreclosures. \n111.  A comparison of the time from origination to foreclosure of JPMorgan’s \n19 \nloans originated in Los Angeles shows a marked disparity with respect to the speed \n20 \nwith which loans to African-Americans and Latinos and whites move into foreclosure.  \n21 \nThe average time to foreclosure for African-American borrowers is 2.906 years, and \n22 \nfor Latino borrowers is 2.739 years.  By comparison, the average time to foreclosure \n23 \nfor white borrowers is 3.250 years.  These statistically significant disparities \n24 \ndemonstrate that JPMorgan aggressively moved minority borrowers into foreclosure \n25 \nas compared with how the Bank handled foreclosures for white borrowers. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 38 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 42 of 56   Page ID #:42\n \n1  112.  This disparity in time to foreclosure is further evidence that JPMorgan is \n2  engaged in lending practices consistent with reverse redlining.  The disparity in time \n3  to foreclosure demonstrates that JPMorgan is engaged in irresponsible underwriting in \n4  African-American and Latino communities that does not serve the best interests of \n5  borrowers.  If JPMorgan were applying the same underwriting practices in African-\n6  American and Latino neighborhoods and white neighborhoods in Los Angeles, there \n7  would not be a significant difference in time to foreclosure.  Were JPMorgan \n8  underwriting borrowers in both communities with equal care and attention to proper \n9  underwriting practices, borrowers in African-American and Latino communities \n10  would not find themselves in financial straits significantly sooner during the lives of \n11  their loans than borrowers in white communities.  The faster time to foreclosure in \n12  African-American and Latino neighborhoods is consistent with underwriting practices \n13  in minority communities that are less concerned with determining a borrower’s ability \n14  to pay and qualifications for the loan than they are in maximizing short-term profit. \n15  113.  The HUD/Treasury Report confirms that time to foreclosure is an \n16  important indicator of predatory practices:  “[t]he speed with which the subprime \n17  loans in these communities have gone to foreclosure suggests that some lenders may \n18  be making mortgage loans to borrowers who did not have the ability to repay those \n19  loans at the time of origination.”30 \n20  3.  Data shows that the discriminatory loan terms cause the foreclosures. \n21  114.  JPMorgan’s discriminatory lending practices cause foreclosures and \n22  vacancies in minority communities in Los Angeles. \n23  115.  Steering borrowers into loans that are less advantageous than loans for \n24  which they qualify, including steering borrowers who qualify for prime loans into \n25  subprime loans, can cause foreclosures because the borrowers are required to make \n26  higher loan payments.  The difference between what a borrower who is steered in this \n27                                                   \n30 HUD/Treasury Report at 25. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 39 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 43 of 56   Page ID #:43\n \n1  manner must pay and the lower amount for which the borrower qualified can cause the \n2  borrower to be unable to make payments on the mortgage.  In such instances, the \n3  borrower would have continued to make payments on the mortgage and remained in \n4  possession of the premises had JPMorgan made the loan without improperly steering \n5  the borrower into a subprime, or less advantageous loan.  Steering borrowers in this \n6  manner, therefore, causes foreclosures and vacancies. \n7  116.  Giving a loan to an applicant who does not qualify for the loan, especially \n8  a refinance or home equity loan, can also cause foreclosures and vacancies.  Some \n9  homeowners live in properties that they own subject to no mortgage.  Other \n10  homeowners live in properties with modest mortgages that they can comfortably \n11  afford to pay.  Where a lender, such as JPMorgan, solicits such a homeowner to take \n12  out a home equity loan on his or her property, or alternatively, to refinance his or her \n13  existing loan into a larger loan without proper underwriting to assure that the borrower \n14  can make the monthly payments for the new, larger loan, the result is likely to be that \n15  the borrower will be unable to make payments on the mortgage.  This is particularly \n16  true where the borrower is refinanced from a fixed-rate loan into an adjustable rate \n17  loan that the lender knows the borrower cannot afford should interest rates rise.  In \n18  some instances, the lender may refinance the borrower into a new loan that the lender \n19  knows the borrower cannot sustain, given the borrower’s present debt obligations and \n20  financial resources.  In such circumstances, the likely result of such practices is to \n21  cause homeowners who are otherwise occupying properties without a mortgage, or \n22  comfortably making payments on a modest existing mortgage, to be unable to make \n23  payment on a new, unaffordable loan.  This, in turn, causes foreclosures and \n24  vacancies.  If these unaffordable refinance and home equity loans had not been made, \n25  the subject properties would not have become vacant. \n26  117.

The regression analysis further demonstrates that a predatory loan in a \n4  heavily minority neighborhood (census tract consisting of at least 80% African-\n5  American and Latino households) is 2.946 times more likely to result in foreclosure as \n6  is a non-predatory loan with similar risk characteristics in a heavily white \n7  neighborhood (census tract with at least 80% white households).  These odds ratios \n8  demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant differences between African-\n9  American and white borrowers and between Latino and white borrowers. \n10  119.  The regression analysis also demonstrates that a predatory loan made to \n11  an African-American borrower was 1.657 times more likely to result in foreclosure as \n12  was a non-predatory loan made to a white borrower with similar borrower and \n13  underwriting characteristics.  A predatory loan made to a Latino borrower was 2.232 \n14  times as likely to result in foreclosure as was a non-predatory loan made to a white \n15  borrower with similar risk characteristics.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of \n16  statistically significant differences between African-American and white borrowers, \n17  and between Latino and white borrowers. \n18  120.  A regression analysis of government loans (FHA/VA) issued by \n19  JPMorgan in Los Angeles from 2009-2011, controlling for borrower race and \n20  objective risk characteristics such as ratio of loan amount to income, demonstrates that \n21  a government loan is 5.559 times more likely to result in foreclosure as is a non-\n22  government loan.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant \n23  differences between African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and \n24  white borrowers. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 41 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 45 of 56   Page ID #:45\n \n1  VI.  INJURY TO LOS ANGELES CAUSED BY JPMORGAN’S  \nDISCRIMINATORY LOAN PRACTICES  \n2 \n121.  Los Angeles has suffered financial injuries as a direct result of \n3 \nJPMorgan’s pattern or practice of reverse redlining and the resulting \n4 \ndisproportionately high rate of foreclosure on JPMorgan loans to African-Americans \n5 \nand Latinos in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  Los Angeles seeks redress for \n6 \nthese injuries.  The City does not seek redress in this action for injuries resulting from \n7 \nforeclosures on mortgages originated by lenders other than JPMorgan. \n8 \n122.  JPMorgan continues to engage in the discriminatory pattern or practice \n9 \ndescribed herein with similar and continuing deleterious consequences to the City. \n10 \n123.  The City seeks damages based on reduced property tax revenues based on \n11 \n(a) the decreased value of the foreclosed properties themselves, and (b) the decreased \n12 \nvalue of properties surrounding the foreclosed properties.  In addition, the City seeks \n13 \ndamages based on municipal services that it still must provide to remedy blight and \n14 \nunsafe and dangerous conditions which exist at vacant properties that entered \n15 \nforeclosure as a result of JPMorgan’s illegal lending practices. \n16 \nA.  Los Angeles has been Injured by a Reduction in Property Tax Revenues \n17  from Foreclosures Caused by Discriminatory Loans Issued by JPMorgan \n18  124.  As stated in a September 2011 Report by the Alliance of Californians for \n19  Community Empowerment and the California Reinvestment Coalition, entitled The \n20  Wall Street Wrecking Ball:  What Foreclosures are Costing Los Angeles \n21  Neighborhoods (“Cost to Los Angeles Report”), “[w]hen a home falls into foreclosure, \n22  it affects the property value of the foreclosed home as well as the values of other \n23  homes in the neighborhood.”  These decreased property values in turn reduce property \n24  tax revenues to the City. \n25  125.  “As property values drop an estimated $78.8 billion, Los Angeles \n26  communities could lose as much as $481 million in property tax revenue” from the \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 42 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 46 of 56   Page ID #:46\n \n1  decreased value of the foreclosed homes themselves and those in the surrounding \n2  neighborhoods.31 \n3  126.  To be clear, vacancies and short sales even prior to completion of \n4  foreclosure also result in diminished home values.  Indeed, “[i]n 12 states, including \n5  California, Florida, Arizona, New York and New Jersey, pre-foreclosure sales actually \n6  outnumbered REO sales.”32  Such distressed sales reduce property values.33 \n7  1.  The decreased value of the properties foreclosed by JPMorgan result \nin reduced property tax revenues. \n8 \n127.  The Cost to Los Angeles Report states that “[i]t is estimated that homes in \n9 \nforeclosure experience a 22% decline in value.”34 \n10 \n128.  For example, “[t]hat means the impact of the 200,000 foreclosures \n11 \nestimated for the period 2008 through 2011 will be more than $26 billion in lost home \n12 \nvalue in communities across Los Angeles.”35  A portion of this lost home value is \n13 \nattributable to homes foreclosed as a result of JPMorgan’s discriminatory loan \n14 \npractices. \n15 \n129.  The decreased property values of foreclosed homes in turn reduce \n16 \nproperty tax revenues to the City and constitute damages suffered by Los Angeles. \n17 \n2.  The decreased value of properties in the neighborhoods surrounding \n18  foreclosed properties results in reduced property tax revenues. \n19  130.  JPMorgan foreclosure properties and the problems associated with them \n20  likewise cause especially significant declines in surrounding property values because \n21  the neighborhoods become less desirable.  This in turn reduces the property tax \n22  revenues collected by Los Angeles. \n23                                                   \n31 Cost to Los Angeles Report at 3. \n24  32 See http://www.realtytrac.com/content/news-and-opinion/short-sales-increasing-\nin-2012--short-sale-process----realtytrac-7204. \n25 \n33 See http://www.realtytrac.com/content/foreclosure-market-report/us-foreclosure-\n26  sales-and-short-sales-report-q1-2013-7732. \n34 Id. \n27 \n35 Id. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 43 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 47 of 56   Page ID #:47\n \n1  131.  Property tax losses suffered by Los Angeles as a result of JPMorgan’s \n2  foreclosures are fully capable of empirical quantification. \n3  132.  Routinely maintained property tax and other data allow for the precise \n4  calculation of the property tax revenues lost by the City as a direct result of particular \n5  JPMorgan foreclosures.  Using a well-established statistical regression technique that \n6  focuses on effects on neighboring properties, the City can isolate the lost property \n7  value attributable to JPMorgan foreclosures from losses attributable to other causes, \n8  such as neighborhood conditions.  This technique, known as hedonic regression, when \n9  applied to housing markets, isolates the factors that contribute to the value of a \n10  property by studying thousands of housing transactions.  Those factors include the size \n11  of a home, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether the neighborhood is safe, \n12  whether neighboring properties are well-maintained, and more.  Hedonic analysis \n13  determines the contribution of each of these house and neighborhood characteristics to \n14  the value of a home. \n15  133.  The number of foreclosures in a neighborhood is one of the neighborhood \n16  traits that hedonic analysis can examine.  Hedonic analysis allows for the calculation \n17  of the impact on a property’s value of the first foreclosure in close proximity (e.g., ⅛ \n18  or ¼ of a mile), the average impact of subsequent foreclosures, and the impact of the \n19  last foreclosure. \n20  134.  Foreclosures attributable to JPMorgan in minority neighborhoods in Los \n21  Angeles can be analyzed through hedonic regression to calculate the resulting loss in \n22  the property values of nearby homes.  This loss can be distinguished from any loss \n23  attributable to non-JPMorgan foreclosures or other causes.  The loss in property value \n24  in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles attributable to JPMorgan’s unlawful acts \n25  and consequent foreclosures can be used to calculate the City’s corresponding loss in \n26  property tax revenues. \n27 \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 44 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 48 of 56   Page ID #:48\n \n1  135.  Various studies establish that hedonic regression can be used for this \n2  purpose.  A study published by the Fannie Mae Foundation, using Chicago as an \n3  example, determined that each foreclosure is responsible for an average decline of \n4  approximately 1.1% in the value of each single-family home within an eighth of a \n5  mile.36 \n6  136.  Other studies have focused on the impact of abandoned homes on \n7  surrounding property values.  A study in Philadelphia, for example, found that each \n8  home within 150 feet of an abandoned home declined in value by an average of \n9  $7,627; homes within 150 to 299 feet declined in value by $6,810; and homes within \n10  300 to 449 feet declined in value by $3,542.37 \n11  137.  These studies highlight the foreseeability of tax related harm to the City \n12  as the result of foreclosures arising from discriminatory loans. \n13  138.  And most recently, the Cost to Los Angeles Report stated, “[i]t is \n14  conservatively estimated that each foreclosed property will cause the value of \n15  neighboring homes within an eighth of a mile to drop 0.9%.”  Thus, “[i]n Los Angeles, \n16  impacted homeowners could experience property devaluation of $53 billion.”  This \n17  decreased property value of neighboring homes in turn reduces property tax revenues \n18  to the City. \n19  139.  Application of such Hedonic regression methodology to data regularly \n20  maintained by Los Angeles can be used to quantify precisely the property tax injury to \n21  the City caused by JPMorgan’s discriminatory lending practices and resulting \n22  foreclosures in minority neighborhoods. \n23   \n24 \n                                                 \n25  36 See Dan Immergluck & Geoff Smith, The External Costs of Foreclosure: The \nImpact of Single-Family Mortgage Foreclosures on Property Values, 17 HOUSING \n26  POLICY DEBATE 57 (2006) at 69. \n27  37 See Anne B.

Los Angeles Is Injured Because It Still Must Provide Costly Municipal \nServices for Properties in Minority Neighborhoods that Have Become \n2  Vacant as a Direct Result of Discriminatory Loans Originated or \nPurchased by JPMorgan \n3 \n140.  Vacant JPMorgan foreclosure properties cause direct costs to the City \n4 \nbecause the City is required to provide increased municipal services at these \n5 \nproperties.  Even prior to completion of the foreclosure process, data shows that 20% \n6 \nof homes are vacated.38  These increased municipal services would not have been \n7 \nnecessary if the properties were occupied. \n8 \n141.  For example, the City’s Police Department must send personnel and \n9 \npolice vehicles to vacant JPMorgan foreclosure properties to respond to public health \n10 \nand safety threats that arise at these properties because the properties are vacant.  \n11 \nBecause violent crime has been found to increase 2.33% for every 1% increase in \n12 \nforeclosures, among other services, LAPD must respond to calls reporting suspicious \n13 \nactivity at vacant properties, perform ongoing investigations involving criminal \n14 \nactivity, including gang activity, at vacant properties. \n15 \n142.  Likewise, the Code Enforcement Bureau of the Los Angeles Building and \n16 \nSafety Department (“Building and Safety Department”) must devote personnel time \n17 \nand out-of-pocket funds to inspect vacant properties and issue orders for violations of \n18 \nthe municipal code to be fixed.  When the municipal code violations are not fixed, the \n19 \nBuilding and Safety Department is required to perform certain services, including, but \n20 \nnot limited to, removing excess vegetation at vacant properties, hauling away trash \n21 \nand debris at vacant properties, boarding vacant property from casual entry, putting up \n22 \nfencing to secure vacant properties, putting up fencing to prevent access to swimming \n23 \npools by young children at vacant properties, coordinating with the Los Angeles \n24 \nCounty Health Department to chemically treat the pools at vacant properties to prevent \n25 \nmosquitos from breeding, painting and removing graffiti at vacant properties, \n26 \n                                                 \n27  38 See http://www.realtytrac.com/content/foreclosure-market-report/owner-vacated-\nforeclosure-update-7771. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 46 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 50 of 56   Page ID #:50\n \n1  condemning and demolishing vacant structures deemed an imminent hazard to public \n2  safety, and having vacant properties frequented by gangs declared a public nuisance \n3  and demolished on that basis. \n4  143.  As stated by the Cost to Los Angeles Report, “[l]ocal government \n5  agencies have to spend money and staff time on blighted foreclosed properties, \n6  providing maintenance, inspections, trash removal, increased public safety calls, and \n7  other code enforcement services …. Responding to these needs is a gargantuan task \n8  that involves multiple agencies and multiple levels of local government.”39 \n9  144.  Moreover, as discussed above, the Apgar-Duda report underscores the \n10  foreseeability of municipal costs as the result of foreclosures arising from \n11  discriminatory loans. \n12  VII.  SAMPLE FORECLOSURE PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF LOS \nANGELES \n13 \n145.  Plaintiff has already identified two thousand five hundred and sixty-four \n14 \n(2,564) discriminatory loans issued by JPMorgan in Los Angeles between 2004-2011 \n15 \nthat resulted in commencement of foreclosure proceedings.40  The City has already \n16 \nincurred, or will incur in the future, damages corresponding to each of these \n17 \nproperties.  A sample of property addresses corresponding to these foreclosures is set \n18 \nforth below: \n19 \n2814 Altura St., 90031 \n20 \n \n7411 S. Hoover St., 90044 \n21 \n \n22 \n3905 Wisconsin St., 90037 \n \n23 \n                                                 \n24  39 Id. at 3. \n40 Plaintiff anticipates that it will be able to identify significantly more foreclosures \n25 \nresulting from the issuance of discriminatory loans during this time period with the \nbenefit of discovery.  This conclusion derives from the fact that, because of certain \n26 \nreporting limitations, the publicly available mortgage loan databases utilized by \nPlaintiff are not as comprehensive as the mortgage loan databases maintained by and \n27 \nin the possession of an issuing bank.  \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 47 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 51 of 56   Page ID #:51\n \n1  1451 E. 54th St. 90011 \n \n2 \n5107 Alhambra Ave., 90032 \n3   \n238 E.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND CONTINUING VIOLATIONS \n11  DOCTRINE \n12  146.  As alleged herein, Defendant JPMorgan has engaged in a continuous \n13  pattern and practice of mortgage discrimination in Los Angeles since at least 2004 by \n14  imposing different terms or conditions on a discriminatory and legally prohibited \n15  basis.  In order to maximize profits at the expense of the City of Los Angeles and \n16  minority borrowers, JPMorgan adapted its unlawful discrimination to changing market \n17  conditions.  This unlawful pattern and practice conduct is continuing through the \n18  present and has not terminated.  Therefore, the operative statute of limitations \n19  governing actions brought pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Act has not \n20  commenced to run.  \n21  IX.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n22  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n23  (Violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, et seq.) \n24  147.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference all allegations contained in \n25  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n26  148.  The Fair Housing Act’s stated purpose is to provide, “within \n27  constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States.” \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 48 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 52 of 56   Page ID #:52\n \n1  149.  In contravention of that purpose, JPMorgan’s acts, policies, and practices \n2  as described constitute intentional lending discrimination on the basis of race.  \n3  JPMorgan has intentionally targeted residents of predominantly African-American and \n4  Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles for different treatment than residents of \n5  predominantly white neighborhoods in Los Angeles with respect to mortgage lending.  \n6  JPMorgan has intentionally targeted residents of these neighborhoods for high-cost \n7  loans without regard to their credit qualifications and without regard to whether they \n8  qualify for more advantageous loans, including prime loans.  JPMorgan has \n9  intentionally targeted residents of these neighborhoods for increased interest rates, \n10  points, and fees, and for other disadvantageous loan terms including, but not limited \n11  to, adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, and balloon payments.  JPMorgan has \n12  intentionally targeted residents of these neighborhoods for unfair and deceptive \n13  lending practices in connection with marketing and underwriting mortgage loans. \n14  150.  JPMorgan’s acts, policies, and practices have had an adverse and \n15  disproportionate impact on African-Americans and Latinos and residents of \n16  predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles as \n17  compared to similarly situated whites and residents of predominantly white \n18  neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  This adverse and disproportionate impact is the direct \n19  result of JPMorgan’s policies of providing discretion to loan officers and others \n20  responsible for mortgage lending; failing to monitor this discretion to ensure that \n21  borrowers were being placed in loan products on a nondiscriminatory basis when \n22  JPMorgan had notice of widespread product placement disparities based on race and \n23  national origin; giving loan officers and others responsible for mortgage lending large \n24  financial incentives to issue loans to African-Americans and Latinos that are costlier \n25  than better loans for which they qualify; otherwise encouraging and directing loan \n26  officers and others responsible for mortgage lending to steer borrowers into high-cost \n27  loans or loans with adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, or balloon payments \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 49 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 53 of 56   Page ID #:53\n \n1  without regard for whether they qualify for better loans; and setting interest rate caps.  \n2  These policies have caused African-Americans and Latinos and residents of \n3  predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles to receive \n4  mortgage loans from JPMorgan that have materially less favorable terms than \n5  mortgage loans given by JPMorgan to similarly situated whites and residents of \n6  predominantly white neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and that are materially more \n7  likely to result in foreclosure. \n8  151.  JPMorgan’s residential lending-related acts, policies, and practices \n9  constitute reverse redlining and violate the Fair Housing Act as: \n10  (a)  Discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in making \n11  available, or in the terms and conditions of, residential real estate-related transactions, \n12  in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a); and \n13  (b)  Discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in the terms, \n14  conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). \n15  152.  JPMorgan’s policies or practices are not justified by business necessity or \n16  legitimate business interests. \n17  153.  JPMorgan’s policies and practices are continuing. \n18  154.  The City is an “aggrieved person” as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 3602(i) and \n19  has suffered damages as a result of JPMorgan’s conduct. \n20  155.  The City’s damages include lost tax revenues and the need to provide \n21  increased municipal services.  The loss of tax revenues at specific foreclosure sites and \n22  at closely neighboring properties in predominantly minority neighborhoods of the City \n23  was a foreseeable consequence that was fairly traceable to JPMorgan’s discriminatory \n24  lending.  Likewise, the need to provide increased municipal services at blighted \n25  foreclosure sites in predominantly minority neighborhoods of the City was a \n26  foreseeable consequence that was fairly traceable to JPMorgan’s discriminatory \n27  lending. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 50 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 54 of 56   Page ID #:54\n \n1  156.  JPMorgan’s policies and practices, as described herein, have and has had \n2  the purpose and effect of discriminating on the basis of race or national origin.  These \n3  policies and practices were intentional, willful, or implemented with reckless disregard \n4  for the rights of African-American and Latino borrowers. \n5  157.  The City has a substantial interest in preventing discriminatory lending \n6  that causes disproportionately minority home foreclosures within its boundaries, in \n7  preventing segregated areas where minority loans are more likely to foreclose, and in \n8  holding banks accountable for damages arising from that discriminatory lending.  \n9  Accordingly, the City’s interests in obtaining injunctive relief to prevent such \n10  discrimination and in remedying the blight and recovering the lost property taxes \n11  resulting from the disproportionately minority home foreclosures in Los Angeles are \n12  directly related to ensuring “fair housing throughout the United States.” \n13  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n14  (Common Law Claim For Restitution Based On California Law) \n15  158.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference all allegations contained in \n16  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n17  159.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ predatory lending \n18  practices, Defendant has been enriched at Plaintiff’s expense.  Defendants have failed \n19  to remit those wrongfully obtained benefits or reimburse the City for their costs \n20  improperly caused by Defendants, and retention of the benefits by Defendants would \n21  be unjust without payment. \n22  160.  In addition, to its detriment the City has paid for the Defendants’ \n23  externalities, or Defendants’ costs of harm caused by its mortgage lending \n24  discrimination, in circumstances where Defendants are and have been aware of this \n25  obvious benefit and retention of such benefit would be unjust. \n26  161.  Accordingly, the Court should order restitution, disgorgement of profits, \n27  and/or any other equitable relief deemed appropriate by the Court. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF   - 51 -\nTHE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT \n010346-11  691167 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168   Document 1   Filed 05/30/14   Page 55 of 56   Page ID #:55\n \n1  DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \n2  Pursuant to Fed.

NATURE OF THE ACTION \n2  1.  It is axiomatic that banks should not make discriminatory loans.  Banks \n3  must extend credit to minorities on equal terms as they do to other similarly situated \n4  borrowers.  Banks should not target minority neighborhoods for loans that \n5  discriminate nor make loans to minorities on terms that are worse than those offered to \n6  whites with similar credit characteristics.  When banks engage in such discriminatory \n7  conduct, the misconduct has profound financial consequences for the cities in which \n8  mortgaged properties exist, and banks should be responsible for those financial \n9  consequences.  Banks should reimburse the City for lost tax revenues due to \n10  discriminatory lending.  And banks should pay the costs of repairing and maintaining \n11  properties that go into foreclosure due to discriminatory lending.  This lawsuit arises \n12  because JPMorgan breached these legally mandated obligations and foreseeably \n13  injured the City of Los Angeles. \n14  A.  JPMorgan Has Engaged in a Continuing Pattern of Discriminatory \nMortgage Lending Practices in Los Angeles Resulting in Foreclosures \n15 \n2.  This suit is brought pursuant to the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (“FHA”), as \n16 \namended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, et seq., by the City of Los Angeles (“Los Angeles” or \n17 \n“City”) to seek redress for injuries caused by JPMorgan’s1 (“JPMorgan” or “the \n18 \nBank”) pattern or practice of illegal and discriminatory mortgage lending.  \n19 \nSpecifically, Los Angeles seeks injunctive relief and damages for the injuries caused \n20 \nby foreclosures on JPMorgan’s loans in minority neighborhoods and to minority \n21 \nborrowers that are the result of JPMorgan’s unlawful and discriminatory lending \n22 \n                                                 \n23  1 Defendants collectively are referred to as “JPMorgan,” including:  JPMorgan \nChase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase, and Chase Manhattan \n24  Bank USA, N.A.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the result of the combination of several \nlarge U.S. banking companies over the last decade including JPMorgan Manhattan \n25  Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., Bank One, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are also liable for residential home loans \n26  and lending operations acquired from, and/or sold by or through, Bear Stearns \nResidential Mortgage, Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, Encore Credit \n27  Corporation, Performance Credit Corporation, JPE Home Finance LLC, and Bravo \nCredit Corp. \n28 \n- 1 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 5 of 53   Page ID #:350\n \n1  practices.  The unlawful conduct alleged herein consists of both intentional \n2  discrimination and disparate impact discrimination.   \n3  3.  JPMorgan has engaged in a continuous pattern and practice of mortgage \n4  discrimination in Los Angeles since at least 2004 by imposing different terms or \n5  conditions on a discriminatory and legally prohibited basis.  In order to maximize \n6  profits at the expense of the City of Los Angeles and minority borrowers, JPMorgan \n7  adapted its unlawful discrimination to changing market conditions.  This unlawful \n8  pattern and practice is continuing through the present and has not terminated. \n9  Therefore, the operative statute of limitations governing actions brought pursuant to \n10  the Federal Fair Housing Act has not commenced to run. \n11  4.  The pattern and practice of lending discrimination engaged in by \n12  JPMorgan consists of traditional redlining2 and reverse redlining,3 both of which have \n13  been deemed to violate the FHA by federal courts throughout the country.  JPMorgan \n14  engaged in redlining, and continues to engage in said conduct, by refusing to extend \n15  mortgage credit to minority borrowers in Los Angeles on equal terms as offered to \n16  non-minority borrowers.  JPMorgan engaged in reverse redlining, and continues to \n17  engage in said conduct, by extending mortgage credit on predatory terms to minority \n18  borrowers in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles on the basis of the race or \n19  ethnicity of its residents.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently \n20  acknowledged these twin evils of mortgage discrimination and explained that both \n21  types of mortgage discrimination “continue to have particular significance to mortgage \n22  markets.”4    \n23 \n                                                 \n24  2 Redlining is the practice of denying credit to particular neighborhoods based on \nrace. \n25 \n3 Reverse redlining is the practice of flooding a minority community with \n26  exploitative loan products. \n4 Remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at the Operation HOPE \n27  Global Financial Dignity Summit, Atlanta, Georgia at pg. 10 (November 15, 2012) \navailable at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20121115a.htm. \n28 \n- 2 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 6 of 53   Page ID #:351\n \n1  5.  Major banks such as JPMorgan have a long history of engaging in \n2  redlining throughout Los Angeles.  That practice began to change in the late 1990s, \n3  when JPMorgan adapted to changing market conditions and began to flood historically \n4  underserved minority communities with mortgage loans that consisted of a variety of \n5  high cost and abusive mortgage loan products with predatory terms as compared to the \n6  mortgage loans issued to white borrowers (reverse redlining). \n7  6.  JPMorgan’s discriminatory lending practices have the purpose and effect \n8  of placing vulnerable, underserved borrowers in loans they cannot afford.  Reverse \n9  redlining maximizes JPMorgan’s profit without regard to the borrower’s best interest, \n10  the borrower’s ability to repay, or the financial health of underserved minority \n11  neighborhoods.  Moreover, JPMorgan has averted any significant risk to itself by \n12  selling the vast majority of mortgage loans it originates or purchases on the secondary \n13  market (collectively “JPMorgan Loans”).  \n14  7.  Between 1996-2006, one category of discriminatory loan products – \n15  subprime loans – grew throughout the country from $97 billion to $640 billion.  These \n16  loans were frequently targeted to minorities.  Upon information and belief, the lack of \n17  accessible credit resulting from JPMorgan’s previous pattern and practice of redlining \n18  in the minority communities in Los Angeles created conditions whereby the Bank could \n19  easily target and exploit the underserved minority communities who due to traditional \n20  redlining had been denied credit. \n21  8.  Thereafter, following several years of issuing abusive, subprime \n22  mortgage loans throughout the minority communities of Los Angeles, commencing in \n23  or around 2007, JPMorgan once again adapted to changing market conditions while \n24  continuing its pattern and practice of issuing a variety of discriminatory loan products.  \n25  Simultaneously, JPMorgan also decided to curtail the issuance of mortgage credit to \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 3 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 7 of 53   Page ID #:352\n \n1  minority borrowers in Los Angeles.5  In other words, JPMorgan not only refused to \n2  extend credit to minority borrowers when compared to white borrowers, but when the \n3  Bank did extend credit, it did so on predatory terms.  This combination of reverse \n4  redlining and redlining represents a continuing and unbroken pattern and practice of \n5  mortgage lending discrimination in Los Angeles that still exists today.   \n6  9.  JPMorgan’s pattern and practice of reverse redlining has caused an \n7  excessive and disproportionately high number of foreclosures on the JPMorgan Loans \n8  it has made in the minority neighborhoods of Los Angeles.  Foreclosures on loans \n9  originated by JPMorgan are concentrated in these neighborhoods even though the bulk \n10  of JPMorgan’s lending in Los Angeles is in white neighborhoods.  A loan in a \n11  predominantly minority neighborhood is 5.174 times more likely to result in \n12  foreclosure than is a loan in a predominantly white neighborhood. \n13  10.  JPMorgan’s pattern and practice of traditional redlining has also caused \n14  an excessive and disproportionately high number of foreclosures in the minority \n15  neighborhoods of Los Angeles.  These foreclosures often occur when a minority \n16  borrower who previously received a predatory loan sought to refinance the loan, only \n17  to discover that JPMorgan refused to extend credit at all, or on equal terms as when \n18  refinancing similar loans issued to white borrowers.  The inevitable result of the \n19  combination of issuing a predatory loan, and then refusing to refinance the loan, was \n20  foreclosure.   \n21  11.  JPMorgan would have had comparable foreclosure rates in minority and \n22  white communities if it had properly and uniformly applied responsible underwriting \n23  practices in both areas.  JPMorgan possesses sophisticated underwriting technology \n24  and data that allows it to predict with precision the likelihood of delinquency, default, \n25  or foreclosure.  The fact that JPMorgan’s foreclosures are so disproportionately \n26 \n                                                 \n5 California Reinvestment Coalition, From Foreclosure to Re-Redlining (2010), at \n27  4 (available at http://www.community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-\nwealth.org/files/downloads/report-stein-gwynn.pdf). \n28 \n- 4 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 8 of 53   Page ID #:353\n \n1  concentrated in minority neighborhoods is not the product of random events.  To the \n2  contrary, it reflects and is fully consistent with JPMorgan’s practice of targeting \n3  minority neighborhoods and customers for discriminatory practices and predatory \n4  pricing and products.  It also reflects and is consistent with JPMorgan’s practice of \n5  failing to underwrite minority borrowers’ applications properly, and of putting these \n6  borrowers into loans which (1) have more onerous terms than loans given to similarly \n7  situated white borrowers, and (2) the borrowers cannot afford, leading to foreclosures.   \n8  12.  The Bank’s discriminatory lending practices are evidenced by \n9  information from confidential witness statements provided by former employees of \n10  JPMorgan (discussed further herein).  For example: \n11   \na)  “The loans just weren’t going through in that \n12  [minority neighborhood]. It wasn’t worth it [to the \nBank] to have someone there.” \n13   \nb)  “The purpose of the [HAMP] program was to get \n14  people out of these bad loans, and the banks refused to \ndo it.  To find out “how they are discriminating, look \n15  at the position of the branches.  That’s going to show \nyou.”  JPMorgan is opening “huge numbers” of \n16  branches across California, “but none of this is \nhappening in minority neighborhoods. That, in itself, \n17  is the biggest indication of discrimination that you can \nfind.” “The redlining and stuff like that, that still goes \n18  on.” \n \n19  c)  “The people who didn’t understand English and stuff \nlike that” tended to face higher interest rates. “There \n20  were a lot of things with which I didn’t agree” at the \nBank.  “A lot of times there was no mercy,” pushing \n21  borrowers into foreclosure while loan modifications \nwere pending.   \n22   \n13.  The reports of these witnesses are confirmed when Los Angeles data on \n23 \nJPMorgan loans is examined.  Such an examination reveals a widespread practice of \n24 \ndiscrimination.  For example, a regression analysis that controls for credit history and \n25 \nother factors demonstrates that an African-American JPMorgan borrower was 2.783 \n26 \ntimes more likely to receive a predatory loan than a white borrower, and a Latino \n27 \nborrower 2.656 times more likely.  The regression analysis confirms that African-\n28 \n- 5 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 9 of 53   Page ID #:354\n \n1  Americans with FICO scores over 660 are 2.389 times more likely to receive a \n2  predatory JPMorgan loan than a white borrower, and a Latino borrower 2.423 times \n3  more likely. \n4  14.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of \n5  Governors of the Federal Reserve System brought an action alleging that certain large \n6  banks, including JPMorgan, engaged in mortgage lending related misconduct that \n7  induced a national foreclosure crisis.  In connection with that action, JPMorgan \n8  entered into a settlement agreement with the government pursuant to which JPMorgan \n9  will:  (a) make a cash payment of $753 million into a settlement fund for distribution \n10  to qualified borrowers; and (b) provide an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure \n11  prevention actions. \n12  15.  In 2012, JPMorgan Chase and four other large mortgage servicers agreed \n13  to a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of \n14  Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the \n15  state attorneys general.  The settlement relates to unethical mortgage origination and \n16  servicing activities similar to the activities alleged herein.  Under the settlement, \n17  JPMorgan will make cash payments of approximately $1.1 billion to 50 states (with a \n18  set aside to certain borrowers); offer approximately $500 million of refinancing to \n19  certain borrowers; and provide approximately $3.7 billion of additional payments for \n20  certain borrowers.   \n21  16.  The past several years have been highly profitable for JPMorgan.  \n22  According to recent press releases, the Bank generated a record amount of (i) net \n23  income ($19.9 billion) and (ii) diluted earnings per share ($5.22). The following charts \n24  illustrate these results. \n25   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 6 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 10 of 53   Page ID #:355\n \n1  Net Income (millions) \n2 \n$20,000\n3 \n$18,000\n4 \n$16,000\n5 \n$14,000\n6 \n$12,000\n7 \n$10,000\n8 \n$8,000\n9 \n$6,000\n10 \n2009 2010 2011 2012\n11 \n \n12 \nEarnings per share \n13 \n14  $6.00\n15 \n$5.00\n16 \n$4.00\n17 \n$3.00\n18 \n19  $2.00\n20 \n$1.00\n21 \n$0.00\n22  2009 2010 2011 2012\n \n23 \n \n17.  At the same time that JPMorgan achieved record financial success, the \n24 \nBank’s discriminatory practices and resulting foreclosures in the City’s minority \n25 \nneighborhoods have inflicted significant, direct, and continuing financial harm to the \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 7 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 11 of 53   Page ID #:356\n \n1  City.  Since 2008, banks have foreclosed on approximately 1.7 million homes in \n2  California, and JPMorgan is responsible for a significant number of these foreclosures. \n3  18.  In addition to reverse redlining, JPMorgan has induced foreclosures since \n4  2009 by failing to extend branch support to minority neighborhoods, pulling existing \n5  Bank support from minority neighborhoods, declining to offer refinancings or loan \n6  modifications to minority customers on fair terms, and otherwise denying minority \n7  borrowers equal access to fair credit.  \n8  19.  One report6 has estimated the impact that the City of Los Angeles has \n9  suffered due to discriminatory lending practices by all lenders as follows: \n10    Overall, Los Angeles homeowners are estimated to have \nlost $78.8 billion in home values as a direct result of the \n11 \n200,000 foreclosures for 2008-2012 alone. \n12 \n  Property tax revenue losses are estimated to be \n13 \n$481 million in the wake of the foreclosure crisis. \n14 \n  The typical foreclosure costs local governments more \n15 \nthan $19,000 for increased costs of safety inspections, \npolice and fire calls, trash removal, and property \n16 \nmaintenance.  In Los Angeles, these costs are estimated \n17 \nto be $1.2 billion. \n18 \n  Los Angeles has 79,029 homeowners underwater totaling \n19  $7.3 billion in loan value.  If banks wrote down those \nmortgages, it could pump $780 million into the local \n20 \neconomy and create 11,353 jobs. \n21 \n20.  In this action the City seeks damages for reduced property tax revenues \n22 \nbased on (a) the decreased value of the foreclosed properties themselves, and (b) the \n23 \ndecreased value of properties surrounding the foreclosed properties.  In addition, the \n24 \nCity seeks damages based on the expenditure of municipal services that will be \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n6 Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment and the California \n27  Reinvestment Coalition, The Wall Street Wrecking Ball:  What Foreclosures are \nCosting Los Angeles Neighborhoods (September 2011). \n28 \n- 8 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 12 of 53   Page ID #:357\n \n1  required to remedy the blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions which exist at \n2  vacant properties that were foreclosed as a result of JPMorgan’s illegal lending \n3  practices. \n4  21.  Because of the multitude of analytic tools available to JPMorgan to \n5  determine the likelihood that a particular mortgage loan would result in default by the \n6  borrower, as well as the existence of various studies, reports, and other pertinent \n7  literature specifically addressing the connection between mortgage loans and \n8  foreclosures, it was foreseeable that JPMorgan knew, or should have known, that a \n9  predatory or high risk loan issued to an African-American or Hispanic in certain \n10  neighborhoods in Los Angeles would result in default and subsequent foreclosure.  \n11  Moreover, because JPMorgan maintains numerous branch offices throughout Los \n12  Angeles, and has knowledge of the specific address for each loan it issued, it was \n13  foreseeable that JPMorgan knew, or should have known, of the condition of foreclosed \n14  properties corresponding to loans that it issued in Los Angeles regardless of whether it \n15  serviced the loan or subsequently sold the servicing rights to a third party. \n16  22.  According to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, “foreclosures can \n17  inflict economic damage beyond the personal suffering and dislocation that \n18  accompany them.  Foreclosed properties that sit vacant for months (or years) often \n19  deteriorate from neglect, adversely affecting not only the value of the individual \n20  property but the values of nearby homes as well.  Concentrations of foreclosures have \n21  been shown to do serious damage to neighborhoods and communities, reducing tax \n22  bases and leading to increased vandalism and crime.  Thus, the overall effect of the \n23  foreclosure wave, especially when concentrated in lower-income and minority areas, \n24  is broader than its effects on individual homeowners.”7   \n25  23.  The discriminatory lending practices at issue herein have resulted in what \n26  many leading commentators describe as the “greatest loss of wealth for people of color \n27 \n                                                 \n7 Bernanke, supra n.4 at pg. 4. \n28 \n- 9 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 13 of 53   Page ID #:358\n \n1  in modern US history.”  It is well-established that poverty and unemployment rates for \n2  minorities exceed those of whites, and therefore, home equity represents a \n3  disproportionately high percentage of the overall wealth for minorities.8  Indeed, \n4  between 2005-2009, the median wealth of Latino households decreased by 66 percent, \n5  and the median wealth of African-American households decreased by 53 percent, \n6  while the median wealth of white households decreased just 16 percent.9  As Federal \n7  Reserve Chairman Bernanke recently explained, as a result of the housing crisis, \n8  “most or all of the hard-won gains in homeownership made by low-income and \n9  minority communities in the past 15 years or so have been reversed.”10  The resulting \n10  impact of these practices represents “nothing short of the preeminent civil rights issue \n11  of our time, erasing, as it has, a generation of hard fought wealth accumulation among \n12  African Americans.”11  \n13  II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n2  A.  Background Regarding Discriminatory Loan Practices, Reverse Redlining, \nand Redlining \n3 \n35.  Prior to the emergence of subprime lending, most mortgage lenders made \n4 \nonly “prime” loans.  Prime lending offered uniformly priced loans to borrowers with \n5 \ngood credit, but individuals with lower credit were not eligible for prime loans. \n6 \n36.  Subprime lending developed and began growing rapidly in the mid-1990s \n7 \nas a result of technological innovations in risk-based pricing and in response to the \n8 \ndemand for credit by borrowers who were denied prime credit by traditional lenders.  \n9 \nAdvances in automated underwriting allowed lenders to predict with improved \n10 \naccuracy the likelihood that a borrower with lower credit will successfully repay a \n11 \nloan.  These innovations gave lenders the ability to adjust the price of loans to match \n12 \nthe different risks presented by borrowers whose credit records did not meet prime \n13 \nstandards.  Lenders found that they could now accurately price loans to reflect the \n14 \nrisks presented by a particular borrower.  When done responsibly, this made credit \n15 \navailable much more broadly than had been the case with prime lending. \n16 \n37.  Responsible subprime lending has opened the door to homeownership to \n17 \nmany people, especially low- to moderate-income and minority consumers, who \n18 \notherwise would have been denied mortgages.  At the same time, however, subprime \n19 \nlending has created opportunities for unscrupulous lenders to target minorities and \n20 \nengage in discriminatory, irresponsible lending practices that result in loans that \n21 \nborrowers cannot afford.  This, in turn, leads directly to defaults and foreclosures. \n22 \n38.  Enticed by the prospect of profits resulting from exorbitant origination \n23 \nfees, points, and related pricing schemes, some irresponsible subprime lenders took \n24 \nadvantage of a rapidly rising real estate market to convince borrowers to enter into \n25 \ndiscriminatory loans that had unfair terms that they could not afford.  Often this was \n26 \naccomplished with the help of deceptive practices and promises to refinance at a later \n27 \ndate.  These abusive subprime lenders did not worry about the consequences of default \n28 \n- 13 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 17 of 53   Page ID #:362\n \n1  or foreclosure to their business because, once made, a significant number of the loans \n2  were sold on the secondary market. \n3  39.  As the subprime market grew, the opportunities for abusive practices \n4  grew with it.  As a consequence, the federal government has found that abusive and \n5  predatory practices “are concentrated in the subprime mortgage market.”12  These \n6  practices, which in recent years have become the target of prosecutors, legislators, and \n7  regulators, include the following: \n8  a.  Placing borrowers in subprime loans even though they qualify for \n9  loans on better terms. \n10  b.  Failing to prudently underwrite hybrid adjustable rate mortgages \n11  (ARMs), such as 2/28s and 3/27s.13  After the borrower pays a low “teaser rate” for the \n12  first two or three years, the interest rate on these loans resets to a much higher rate that \n13  can continue to rise based on market conditions.  Subprime lenders often underwrite \n14  these loans based only on consideration of whether the borrower can make payments \n15  during the initial teaser rate period, without regard to the sharply higher payments that \n16  will be required for the remainder of a loan’s 30-year term.  Irresponsible lenders \n17  aggressively market the low monthly payment that the borrower will pay during the \n18  teaser rate period, misleading borrowers into believing that they can afford that same \n19  low monthly payment for the entire 30-year term of the loan, or that they can refinance \n20  their loan before the teaser rate period expires. \n21  c.  Failing to prudently underwrite refinance loans, where borrowers \n22  substitute unaffordable mortgage loans for existing mortgages that they are well-suited \n23 \n                                                 \n12 United States Department of Housing & Urban Development and United States \n24 \nDepartment of the Treasury, Curbing Predatory Home Mortgage Lending (2000), at 1 \n(available at http://www.huduser.org/Publications/pdf/treasrpt.pdf) (“HUD/Treasury \n25 \nReport”). \n26  13 In a 2/28 ARM, the “2” represents the number of years the mortgage will be fixed \nover the term of the loan, while the “28” represents the number of years the interest \n27  rate paid on the mortgage will be variable.

Such refinanced loans strip much or even all \n2  of that equity by charging substantial new fees, often hiding the fact that the high \n3  settlement costs of the new loan are also being financed.  Lenders that aggressively \n4  market the ability of the borrower to pay off existing credit card and other debts by \n5  refinancing all of their debt into one mortgage loan mislead borrowers into believing \n6  that there is a benefit to debt consolidation, while obscuring the predictable fact that \n7  the borrower will not be able to repay the new loan.  The refinanced loans are \n8  themselves often refinanced repeatedly with ever-increasing fees and higher interest \n9  rates, and with ever-decreasing equity, as borrowers seek to stave off foreclosure. \n10  d.  Allowing mortgage brokers to charge “yield spread premiums” for \n11  qualifying a borrower for an interest rate that is higher than the rate the borrower \n12  qualifies for and can actually afford. \n13  e.  Failing to underwrite loans based on traditional underwriting \n14  criteria such as debt-to-income ratio, loan-to-value ratio, FICO score, and work \n15  history.  Properly applying these criteria ensure that a borrower is obtaining a loan that \n16  he or she has the resources and assets to repay, and ignoring them results in many \n17  loans that bear no relation to borrowers’ ability to repay them.  This allows the lender \n18  to make a quick profit from the origination, but sets the borrower up for default and \n19  foreclosure. \n20  f.  Requiring substantial prepayment penalties that prevent borrowers \n21  whose credit has improved from refinancing their subprime loan to a prime loan.  \n22  Prepayment penalties not only preclude borrowers from refinancing to a more \n23  affordable loan, but reduce the borrowers’ equity when a subprime lender convinces \n24  borrowers to needlessly refinance one subprime loan with another. \n25  g.  Charging excessive points and fees that are not associated with any \n26  increased benefits for the borrower. \n27 \n28 \n- 15 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 19 of 53   Page ID #:364\n \n1  40.  The problem of predatory practices in mortgage lending is particularly \n2  acute in minority communities because of “reverse redlining.”  As used by Congress \n3  and the courts, the term “reverse redlining” refers to the practice of targeting residents \n4  in certain geographic areas for credit on unfair terms due to the racial or ethnic \n5  composition of the area.  This is in contrast to “redlining,” which is the practice of \n6  denying equal access to credit to specific geographic areas because of the racial or \n7  ethnic composition of the area.  Both practices have repeatedly been held to violate the \n8  Federal Fair Housing Act. \n9  41.  Following the onset of the subprime mortgage crisis, and after years of \n10  issuing abusive home loans in minority neighborhoods, the big bank lenders began to \n11  limit the issuance of mortgage credit to minority borrowers (i.e., refusing to refinance \n12  predatory loans).  At the same time, when the big banks did extend credit, they \n13  continued to do so on predatory terms.  \n14  V.  JPMORGAN ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATORY LENDING \nPRACTICES \n15 \nA.  JPMorgan’s Conduct Had a Disparate Impact on Minority Borrowers in \n16  Violation of the Fair Housing Act \n17  1.  Discriminatory lending results in a disproportionate number of \nforeclosures in minority areas. \n18 \n42.  Foreclosures are on the rise in many of the nation’s most vulnerable \n19 \nneighborhoods, particularly those with substantial concentrations of minority \n20 \nhouseholds.  The increase appears to stem from the growing presence of (1) non-\n21 \nconventional lending in these communities and (2) continuing discriminatory lending \n22 \npractices (e.g., steering minorities into loan products with more onerous terms – which \n23 \nhappen to be more profitable for JPMorgan). \n24 \n43.  A seminal report on foreclosure activity by Mark Duda and William \n25 \nApgar documents the negative impact that rising foreclosures have on low-income and \n26 \nlow-wealth minority communities, using Chicago as a case study.  Mr. Apgar is a \n27 \nSenior Scholar at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, and a \n28 \n- 16 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 20 of 53   Page ID #:365\n \n1  Lecturer on Public Policy at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.  He \n2  previously served as the Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal Housing \n3  Commissioner at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and also \n4  Chaired the Federal Housing Finance Board.  Mr. Apgar holds a Ph.D. in Economics \n5  from Harvard University.  Mr. Duda is a Research Fellow at the Joint Center for \n6  Housing Studies.  The Apgar-Duda report has continually been cited by subsequent \n7  governmental, public sector, and private sector reports due to its clarity and \n8  thoroughness with respect to the negative impact foreclosures have on lower-income \n9  and minority neighborhoods.14 \n10  44.  This significant report highlights the foreseeability of foreclosures arising \n11  from predatory lending practices and their attendant harm, demonstrating that such \n12  foreclosures impose significant and predictable costs on borrowers, municipal \n13  governments, and neighboring homeowners. \n14  45.  Another report, by the Center for Responsible Lending, uses a national \n15  dataset to show that the foreclosure rate for low- and moderate-income African-\n16  Americans is approximately 1.8 times higher than it is for low- and moderate-income \n17  non-Hispanic whites.  The gap is smaller for Latinos, especially among low-income \n18  households, but even among low-income Latinos the foreclosure rate is 1.2 times that \n19  of low-income whites.  Racial and ethnic disparities in foreclosure rates cannot be \n20  explained by income, since disparities persist even among higher-income groups.  For \n21  example:  approximately 10 percent of higher-income African-American borrowers \n22  and 15 percent of higher-income Latino borrowers have lost their home to foreclosure, \n23  compared with 4.6 percent of higher income non-Hispanic white borrowers.  Overall, \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  14 See W. Apgar, M. Duda & R.

Nearly 20 percent of loans in high-minority neighborhoods have been \n4  foreclosed upon or are seriously delinquent, with significant implications for the long-\n5  term economic viability of these communities.16 \n6  2.  Minority neighborhoods are disproportionate recipients of predatory \nloans. \n7 \n47.  There is a substantial body of empirical evidence demonstrating the \n8 \nprevalence of reverse redlining in the subprime mortgage market.  These studies show \n9 \nthat, even after controlling for creditworthiness and other legitimate underwriting \n10 \nfactors, subprime loans and the predatory practices often associated with subprime \n11 \nlending are disproportionately targeted at minority neighborhoods.17 \n12 \n48.  In general, as recently observed by the Federal Reserve in December \n13 \n2012, both African-American and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely (in fact, \n14 \nnearly twice as likely) to obtain higher-priced loans than were white borrowers.  These \n15 \nrelationships hold both for home-purchase and refinance lending and for non-\n16 \n17 \n                                                 \n15 Center for Responsible Lending, Lost Ground, 2011: Disparities in Mortgage \n18  Lending and Foreclosures (2011) (available at www.responsiblelending.org/-\nmortgage-lending/research-analysis/Lost-Ground-2011.pdf). \n19 \n16 Id. \n20  17 See Abt Associates, Using Credit Scores to Analyze High-Cost Lending in \nCentral City Neighborhoods (2008); Center for Responsible Lending, Lost Ground, \n21  2011:  Disparities in Mortgage Lending and Foreclosures (2011) (available at www.-\nresponsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/Lost-Ground-2011.pdf ); \n22  Center for Responsible Lending, Unfair Lending: The Effect of Race and Ethnicity on \nthe Price of Subprime Mortgages (2006) (available at \n23  http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/rr011-\nUnfair_Lending-0506.pdf); Finance and Economics Discussion Series Divisions of \n24  Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C, \nSubprime Mortgages: What, Where, and to Whom?

These differences are reduced, but not eliminated, after \n2  controlling for lender and borrower characteristics.  “Over the years, analyses of \n3  HMDA data have consistently found substantial differences in the incidence of higher-\n4  priced lending [] across racial and ethnic lines, differences that cannot be fully \n5  explained by factors included in the HMDA data.”18 \n6  49.  African-Americans and Hispanics were much more likely to receive \n7  subprime loans and loans with features that are associated with higher foreclosures, \n8  specifically prepayment penalties and hybrid or option ARMs.  These disparities were \n9  evident even comparing borrowers within the same credit score ranges.  In fact, the \n10  disparities were especially pronounced for borrowers with higher credit scores.  For \n11  example, among borrowers with a FICO score of over 660 (indicating good credit), \n12  African-Americans and Latinos received a high interest rate loan more than three \n13  times as often as white borrowers.19 \n14  50.  In addition to receiving a higher proportion of higher-rate loans, African-\n15  Americans and Latinos also were much more likely to receive loans with other risky \n16  features, such as hybrid and option ARMs and prepayment penalties.  Disparities in \n17  the incidence of these features are evident across all segments of the credit spectrum.20 \n18  51.

These loans were often unaffordable and unsustainable for \n3  working class families, and inevitably led to large scale foreclosures.  In the past two \n4  years, borrowers and communities struggling to preserve their primary asset – their \n5  home – have found that banks are not willing to work with them to restructure their \n6  mortgages or to offer new loans.”21  Key findings from the 2010 Report include: \n7  (a)  In 2008, minority neighborhoods contained roughly \n63% of the housing in Los Angeles, but suffered over \n8  90% of the City’s foreclosures. \n9  (b)  While predatory and fraudulent lending helped \nprecipitate the foreclosure crisis, a wave of a resetting \n10  option ARM loans threatens to keep California \nimmobilized by foreclosure beyond 2010. \n11 \n(c)  California cities are more likely than the national \n12  average to be saturated with low documentation loans \n(e.g., stated income loans).  In Los Angeles, 74% of \n13  all loans in the sample were made with limited \ndocumentation, as compared to only 56% for all loans \n14  in the sample. \n15  (d)  Minority neighborhoods saw a dramatic decrease in \nlower cost prime loans in 2008.  The drop off from \n16  2006 to 2008 was stunning.  In Los Angeles, less than \n1/3rd as many prime loans were made available by big \n17  bank lenders in minority neighborhoods in 2008, as \ncompared to 2006.   \n18 \n(e)  In 2008, nearly one out of two African-Americans and \n19  Latinos seeking a home loan or refinance were denied, \nas compared to only about one in four whites. \n20 \n(f)  Even though high-cost lending began to decrease \n21  significantly by 2008, when it occurred, it was still \nmore likely to occur in minority neighborhoods as \n22  compared to white neighborhoods.

Since 2008, as the data discussed below makes clear, there has been a \n8 \nshift in the types of loans issued – and not issued – by the Bank.  For example, the \n9 \nBank shifted from offering new subprime loans toward issuing more Home Equity \n10 \nLines of Credit (“HELOCs”) and higher cost FHA/VA loans.22  FHA and VA \n11 \ngovernment loans are characterized as higher risk loans because they are typically \n12 \nmore expensive for a borrower than conventional loans and include fees and costs not \n13 \nassociated with conventional loans.23 Additionally, this fact is further corroborated by \n14 \nthe FHA/VA Mortgage Programs webpage for one of the defendant banks in the \n15 \nCity’s predatory lending cases – Wells Fargo.  According to Wells Fargo’s website: \n16 \n(a) “In many instances, you may find FHA to be a more expensive financing option \n17 \nand should be considered after thoroughly evaluating all other product options that \n18 \nmeet your credit qualifying and financial needs;” (b) “You typically have to pay \n19 \nupfront and monthly FHA mortgage insurance premiums;” and (c) “You typically \n20 \nhave to pay a one-time VA funding fee that can be financed into the loan amount.”24.   \n21 \n22                                                   \n22 While FHA/VA loans are not inherently predatory, these loans have higher risk \n23  features such as higher fees and higher interest rates.  When banks target minorities for \nFHA/VA loans and issue more of them to minorities, they are acting in a \n24  discriminatory manner. \n23 California Reinvestment Coalition, et al., Paying More for the American Dream \n25 \nVI, Racial Disparities in FHA/VA Lending (July 2012); www.fha.com/fha_loan_types; \n26  www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans. \n27 \n24 https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/loan-programs/fha-va-loans. \n28 \n- 21 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 25 of 53   Page ID #:370\n \n1  53.  At the same time, in the last several years, the Bank tightened lending \n2  requirements in a manner that drastically limited the ability of minority borrowers to \n3  refinance or otherwise modify the subprime loans previously issued by the Bank. \n4  54.  A 2011 Report from the California Reinvestment Coalition found that, \n5  between 2008 and 2009, in Los Angeles, the number of conventional refinance loans \n6  made in predominantly white neighborhoods more than doubled (increasing by about \n7  200%), while conventional refinance loans declined in the City’s minority \n8  neighborhoods, where such refinancing was most desperately needed.25  \n9  55.  While at the same time that conventional credit has contracted over the \n10  past five years, FHA lending has expanded dramatically.  During the subprime boom, \n11  FHA lending fell as subprime lenders targeted minority communities.  Now, with little \n12  or no subprime lending, and conventional credit restricted, FHA lending has shot up.  \n13  Overall, the share of loans with government backing went from 5% in 2005 to 26.6% \n14  in 2010.26 \n15  56.  For African-Americans, the share of mortgages used to purchase a home \n16  and backed by a government program increased to almost 80% in 2010; for Latinos \n17  the share increased to 73%.  But for whites, the share increased to only 49%.  At \n18  present, most minority borrowers cannot gain access to the conventional mortgage \n19  market, and instead, are relegated to more expensive FHA loans.27 \n20  57.

She was previously employed as a mortgage loan officer at \n24                                                   \n28 California Reinvestment Coalition, Paying More for the American Dream VI: \nRacial Disparities in FHA/VA Lending (2012) (available at \n25 \nhttp://calreinvest.org/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTIvMDcvMTgvMTZfMzVfMj\nNfMV9wYXlpbmdtb3JlVklfbXVsdGlzdGF0ZV9qdWx5MjAxMl9GSU5BTC5wZGY\n26 \niXV0/payingmoreVI_multistate_july2012-%20FINAL.pdf). \n27  29 The CW statements do not pertain to conduct involving Washington Mutual \nBank or Long Beach Mortgage Company. \n28 \n- 23 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 27 of 53   Page ID #:372\n \n1  WaMu for about a year before JPMorgan purchased WaMu.  She worked almost \n2  entirely with minority (largely Hispanic) customers, almost all of whom sought \n3  refinancing or loan modifications.  \n4  60.  CW2 worked in the mortgage industry for about eight years; he worked \n5  for JPMorgan at multiple branch locations in the greater Los Angeles region as a \n6  mortgage loan originator in the 2011-2012 timeframe. \n7  61.  CW3 worked as an underwriter at the Bank’s corporate office in Los \n8  Angeles during the 2009-2011 timeframe.  She was previously employed at WaMu, \n9  where she was hired in 2002.  She worked at WaMu through the period when \n10  JPMorgan purchased it in 2009, and then she became a JPMorgan employee.  She \n11  worked as a loan modification underwriter with customers who were behind on their \n12  mortgage payments. \n13  62.  CW4 worked as a loss mitigation negotiator and underwriter at a \n14  JPMorgan branch in Los Angeles during the 2009-2010 timeframe.  He worked with \n15  customers who had missed mortgage payments, and he was responsible for making \n16  loan modifications for customers in the default process. \n17  63.  The CWs confirm that JPMorgan has engaged in predatory and otherwise \n18  discriminatory lending practices. \n19  64.  CW3, who worked with customers who were behind on their mortgage \n20  payments, explained that most of these customers had received variable-rate loans that \n21  they could no longer afford after the rates adjusted upward. \n22  65.  CW3 also observed that JPMorgan tended to require prepayment \n23  penalties more often from minority borrowers. \n24  66.  The CW statements show that JPMorgan induced foreclosures by failing \n25  to offer refinancing or loan modifications to minority customers on fair terms – which \n26  constitutes a particularly egregious form of redlining, given that minority borrowers \n27 \n28 \n- 24 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 28 of 53   Page ID #:373\n \n1  sought refinancing or loan modifications with respect to bad loans that the Bank \n2  previously made to them.  \n3  67.  CW1 believes that JPMorgan adopted overly-stringent loan qualification \n4  requirements that resulted in an unnecessarily high rate of refinancing rejections for \n5  minority borrowers.  She encountered months-long delays and very few successes \n6  when attempting to refinance minority customers.  She estimates that 90% of the \n7  minority borrowers who came to her branches desperate for refinancing would not \n8  qualify.  They usually did not have enough income or enough equity in their homes, \n9  she said. \n10  68.  CW1 explained that many minority borrowers who had previously \n11  received “no doc” loans were now asked to provide documentation of income and \n12  other assets, and could not.  She described seeing customers who only owed “$50,000 \n13  to $60,000” on a property worth $250,000 who could not refinance because they either \n14  didn’t have a job or did have a job but had insufficient documentation.  Many others \n15  had income but too little equity in their homes because of falling real estate values.   \n16  69.  CW1 said some of these customers were rejected even though she \n17  believed they should not have been rejected.  According to CW1, JPMorgan’s \n18  refinancing qualification guidelines became “much more conservative” than those set \n19  by federal guidelines.  “That was really heartbreaking,” she said. “Seeing people \n20  sitting there crying. … Those were kind of hard.” \n21  70.  According to CW1, borrowers who did not qualify for refinancing, and \n22  thus sought loan modifications, were essentially encouraged not to make payments on \n23  their homes at all.  She said the Bank informed them that a prerequisite for loan \n24  modification was missing payments.  This created more problems, she explained, \n25  because some of these same borrowers would follow the guidance, skip payments, but \n26  then not receive loan modifications.  After that, “they were just waiting for the sheriff \n27  to come around” and foreclose, she said.   \n28 \n- 25 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 29 of 53   Page ID #:374\n \n1  71.  CW1 said that, when refinancing did take place in her minority \n2  neighborhood branches, it usually came with higher-than-usual interest rates that \n3  corresponded with rising LTV ratios. \n4  72.  During CW1’s employment, JPMorgan withdrew mortgage officers from \n5  both minority neighborhood branches where she worked because “it just wasn’t \n6  feasible to have a loan officer there,” she said.  “The loans just weren’t going through \n7  in that area,” she said.  “It wasn’t worth it to have someone there.” \n8  73.  CW2 said that JPMorgan has tightened its lending requirements since \n9  2008, making almost all loans “fully-doc’d” loans, setting higher standards \n10  (“overlays”) for refinancing than those established under HAMP.  “The banks said, \n11  ‘we’re not going to refinance you,’” he said.  “The purpose of the [HAMP] program \n12  was to get people out of these bad loans, and the banks refused to do it.  And this is \n13  still going on today.” \n14  74.  The Bank operated few, if any, branches in minority neighborhoods of \n15  Los Angeles; CW2 strongly believes that this evidenced an intentional form of \n16  minority “discrimination.”  In the last few years, it became increasingly difficult to \n17  serve minority customers given where the Bank chose to locate its branches, he \n18  explained.  To find out “how they are discriminating, look at the position of the \n19  branches,” he said.  “That’s going to show you.”   \n20  75.  JPMorgan is opening “huge numbers” of branches all across California, \n21  none of which are located in the inner city, according to CW2.  In the upper-middle-\n22  class neighborhood where he lives, JPMorgan is opening what he said appeared to be \n23  as many as seven branches, maybe more.  Another 300 are slated to open in Southern \n24  California, part of 2,000 that will be opening across the state, he said.  “But none of \n25  this is happening in minority neighborhoods,” he added.  “That, in itself, is the biggest \n26  indication of discrimination that you can find.” \n27 \n28 \n- 26 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 30 of 53   Page ID #:375\n \n1  76.  CW2 confirmed that JPMorgan recorded minority status information in \n2  the loan application process.  CW2 believed that some of the minority borrowers he \n3  saw at JPMorgan should have qualified for refinancing, but they did not qualify for \n4  reasons that were unclear to him.  He suspected that minority status played a role in \n5  decision-making by JPMorgan on who to finance.  “The redlining and stuff like that, \n6  that still goes on.”  \n7  77.  CW2 explained that JPMorgan might offer some minority borrowers \n8  “subprime” refinancing, if they were ineligible for HAMP loan modifications.  Such \n9  loans typically offered interest rates that gradually increased over several years. \n10  78.  CW3 said:  “There were a lot of things with which I didn’t agree” at \n11  JPMorgan.  She said there were generally “a lot of policy changes … things that \n12  would happen that the customer wouldn’t know about.”  For example, she noted:  \n13  “Customers would send in their information and we would get it,” then documents \n14  would go missing.  “Everything was messy,” she said, due to the Bank’s “bad \n15  managers.”  As a result, she said, borrowers fell deeper behind on payments and into \n16  foreclosure.  “A lot of times there was no mercy,” she said, referring to the Bank’s \n17  practices of putting people into foreclosure while loan modifications were pending. \n18  79.  CW4 observed that JPMorgan denied minority borrowers loan \n19  modifications in large percentages in the City of Los Angeles because many who were \n20  in foreclosure under old stated-income mortgages were unable to get approved under \n21  the Bank’s new document-based income guidelines. \n22  80.  The CW statements further demonstrate that the Bank increased the \n23  costliness of non-conventional loans at the expense of minority borrowers.   \n24  81.  CW3 estimated that about 35% of the borrowers she dealt with had been \n25  victims of unethical lending practices by JPMorgan.  CW3 also observed that minority \n26  borrowers tended to receive higher interest rates.  Addressing the type of minority \n27 \n28 \n- 27 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 31 of 53   Page ID #:376\n \n1  borrowers that tended to face higher interest rates at JPMorgan, she said, “the people \n2  who didn’t understand English and stuff like that.” \n3  82.  CW3 also observed that smaller home loans at JPMorgan – somewhere \n4  between $75,000 and $100,000 and below – tended to come with much higher interest \n5  rates (e.g., 3%-4% higher), which inevitably impacted minority borrowers more than \n6  non-minority borrowers. \n7  C.  Minorities in Fact Receive Predatory Loan Terms from JPMorgan \n8  83.  As discussed herein, JPMorgan’s predatory loans include:  high-cost \n9  loans (i.e., loans with an interest rate that was at least three percentage points above a \n10  federally-established benchmark), subprime loans, interest-only loans, balloon \n11  payment loans, loans with prepayment penalties, negative amortization loans, no \n12  documentation loans, and/or ARM loans with teaser rates (i.e., lifetime maximum rate \n13  > initial rate + 6%). \n14  84.  Data reported by the Bank and available through public databases shows \n15  that in 2004-2011, 31.5% of loans made by JPMorgan to African-American and \n16  Latino customers in Los Angeles were high cost, but only 8.1% of loans made to white \n17  customers in Los Angeles were high cost.  This data demonstrates a pattern of \n18  statistically significant30 differences in the product placement for high cost loans \n19  between minority and white borrowers.    \n20  85.  The following map of JPMorgan predatory loans originated in Los \n21  Angeles between 2004-2011 illustrates the geographic distribution of predatory loans \n22  in African-American and Latino neighborhoods and white neighborhoods in Los \n23  Angeles.  This map demonstrates that JPMorgan’s predatory loans are \n24  disproportionately located in minority neighborhoods. \n25 \n                                                 \n26  30 Statistical significance is a measure of probability that an observed outcome \nwould not have occurred by chance.  As used in this Complaint, an outcome is \n27  statistically significant if the probability that it could have occurred by chance is less \nthan 5%. \n28 \n- 28 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 32 of 53   Page ID #:377\n \n1   \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n \n17 \n86.  The fact that predatory loans involving all of JPMorgan’s loan products \n18 \nare more heavily concentrated in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles is consistent \n19 \nwith the practice of reverse redlining and, upon information and belief, has contributed \n20 \nsignificantly to the disproportionately high rates of foreclosure in minority \n21 \ncommunities in Los Angeles.   \n22 \nD.  Minorities in Los Angeles Receive Such Predatory Loan Terms from \nJPMorgan Regardless of Creditworthiness \n23 \n24  87.  According to Discretionary Pricing, Mortgage Discrimination, and the \n25  Fair Housing Act, 45 HARVARD CIVIL RIGHTS-CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW REV. 375, 398 \n26  (2010), several studies dating back to 2000 have established that minority borrowers \n27  were charged higher interest rates/fees than similar creditworthy white borrowers. \n28 \n- 29 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 33 of 53   Page ID #:378\n \n1  88.  Likewise, according to A Racial Financial Crisis, 83 TEMPLE LAW REV. \n2  941, 947, 949 (2011), one study concluded that “even after controlling for \n3  underwriting variables, African-American borrowers were 6.1% to 34.3% more likely \n4  than whites to receive a higher rate subprime mortgage during the subprime boom.”  \n5  And another study found that significant loan pricing disparity exists among low risk \n6  borrowers – African-American borrowers were 65% more likely to receive a subprime \n7  home purchase loan than similar creditworthy white borrowers, and 124% more likely \n8  to receive a subprime refinance loan. \n9  89.  Similarly, the Center for Responsible Lending’s November 2011 Report, \n10  Lost Ground, 2011:  Disparities in Mortgage Lending and Foreclosures, stated that \n11  “racial and ethnic differences in foreclosure rates persist even after accounting for \n12  differences in borrower incomes.”  Further, the Center stated it is “particularly \n13  troublesome” that minorities received riskier loans “even within [similar] credit \n14  ranges.”  For example, among borrowers having FICO scores above 660, the incidence \n15  of higher rate loans among various groups was as follows:  whites – 6.2%; African-\n16  American – 21.4%; and Latino – 19.3%. \n17  90.  Moreover, data reported by the Bank and available through public \n18  databases shows that minorities in Los Angeles received predatory loan terms from \n19  JPMorgan more frequently than white borrowers, regardless of creditworthiness.   \n20  91.  A regression analysis of this data controlling for borrower race and \n21  objective risk characteristics such as credit history, loan to value ratio, and the ratio of \n22  loan amount to income demonstrates that, from 2004-2011, an African-American \n23  borrower in Los Angeles was 2.783 times more likely to receive a predatory loan than \n24  was a white borrower possessing similar underwriting and borrower characteristics.  \n25  The regression analysis further demonstrates that the odds that a Latino borrower in \n26  Los Angeles would receive a predatory loan were 2.656 times the odds that a white \n27  borrower possessing similar underwriting and borrower characteristics would receive a \n28 \n- 30 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 34 of 53   Page ID #:379\n \n1  predatory loan.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant \n2  differences between African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and \n3  white borrowers.31   \n4  92.  The regression analysis also shows that these disparities persist when \n5  comparing only Los Angeles-based borrowers with FICO scores above 660.  An \n6  African-American borrower with a FICO score above 660 was 2.389 times more likely \n7  to receive a predatory loan than was a white borrower with similar underwriting and \n8  borrower characteristics.  A Latino borrower with a FICO score above 660 was 2.423 \n9  times more likely to receive a predatory loan than was a white borrower with similar \n10  underwriting and borrower characteristics.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of \n11  statistically significant differences between African-American and white borrowers \n12  and between Latino and white borrowers. \n13  93.  A similar regression analysis taking into account the racial makeup of the \n14  borrower’s neighborhood rather than the individual borrower’s race shows that \n15  borrowers in heavily minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles were more likely to \n16  receive predatory loans than borrowers in heavily white neighborhoods.  For example, \n17  a borrower in a heavily minority census tract (census tract consisting of at least 80% \n18  African-American or Latino households) was 4.098 times more likely than was a \n19  borrower with similar characteristics in a heavily white neighborhood (census tract \n20  with at least 80% white households) to receive a predatory loan.  These odds ratios \n21  demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant differences between African-\n22  American and white borrowers and between Latino and white borrowers. \n23  94.  This data also establishes that JPMorgan disproportionately issued \n24  government loans with higher risk features (FHA/VA) to African-American and \n25 \n                                                 \n26  31 As alleged throughout the Complaint, all references to the date range 2004-2011 \nare intended to include the time period up to and including December 31, 2011.  The \n27  data analysis does not include loans pertaining to Washington Mutual Bank or Long \nBeach Mortgage Company.  \n28 \n- 31 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 35 of 53   Page ID #:380\n \n1  Latino borrowers in Los Angeles from 2009-2011.  A regression analysis controlling \n2  for borrower race and objective risk characteristics such as ratio of loan amount to \n3  income demonstrates that an African-American borrower was 2.660 times more likely \n4  to receive a higher risk government loan than was a white borrower possessing similar \n5  borrower and underwriting characteristics.  The regression analysis further \n6  demonstrates that a Latino borrower was 2.857 times more likely to receive a higher \n7  risk government loan than was a white borrower possessing similar borrower and \n8  underwriting characteristics.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically \n9  significant differences between African-American and white borrowers and between \n10  Latino and white borrowers in the City. \n11  95.  Thus, the disparities are not the result of, or otherwise explained by, \n12  legitimate non-racial underwriting criteria. \n13  E.  JPMorgan’s Targeting of Minorities who in Fact Receive Predatory Loan \nTerms Regardless of Creditworthiness Causes Foreclosures \n14 \n1.  Data shows that JPMorgan’s foreclosures are disproportionately \n15  located in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles. \n16  96.  JPMorgan has intentionally targeted predatory practices at African-\n17  American and Latino neighborhoods and residents.  Far from being a responsible \n18  provider of much-needed credit in minority communities, JPMorgan is a leading cause \n19  of stagnation and decline in African-American and Latino neighborhoods where its \n20  foreclosures are concentrated.  Specifically, since at least 2000, its foreclosures have \n21  been concentrated in neighborhoods with African-American or Latino populations \n22  exceeding 80%. \n23  97.  Although only 34.7% of JPMorgan’s loan originations in Los Angeles \n24  from 2004 to 2011 occurred in census tracts that are at least 50% African-American or \n25  Latino, 51.0% of JPMorgan’s loan originations that had entered foreclosure by \n26  February 2013 were in those census tracts.  Moreover, while 39.1% of JPMorgan’s \n27  loan originations in Los Angeles from 2004 to 2011 occurred in census tracts that \n28 \n- 32 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 36 of 53   Page ID #:381\n \n1  were less than 20% African-American or Latino, only 29.5% of JPMorgan’s loan \n2  originations that had entered foreclosure by February 2013 were in those census tracts.  \n3  This data demonstrates a pattern of statistically significant differences between \n4  African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and white borrowers.    \n5  98.  The following map represents the concentration of JPMorgan’s loan \n6  originations from 2004 through 2011 that had entered foreclosure by February 2013 in \n7  African-American and Latino neighborhoods.  In addition to the disproportionate \n8  distribution of JPMorgan foreclosures in African-American and Latino neighborhoods, \n9  disparate rates of foreclosure based on race further demonstrate JPMorgan’s failure to \n10  follow responsible underwriting practices in minority neighborhoods.  While 18.1% of \n11  JPMorgan’s loans in predominantly (greater than 80%) African-American or Latino \n12  neighborhoods result in foreclosure, the same is true for only 4.1% of its loans in \n13  predominantly (greater than 80%) white neighborhoods.  In other words, a JPMorgan \n14  loan in a predominantly African-American or Latino neighborhood is 5.174 times \n15  more likely to result in foreclosure as is a JPMorgan loan in a predominantly white \n16  neighborhood.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant \n17  differences between African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and \n18  white borrowers. \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 33 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 37 of 53   Page ID #:382\n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n \n \n17 \n99.  Thus, JPMorgan’s discretionary lending policies and pattern or practice \n18 \nof targeting of minorities, who in fact receive predatory loan terms regardless of \n19 \ncreditworthiness, have caused and continue to cause foreclosures in Los Angeles. \n20 \n2.  Data shows that JPMorgan’s loans to minorities result in especially \nquick foreclosures. \n21 \n22  100.  A comparison of the time from origination to foreclosure of JPMorgan’s \n23  loans originated in Los Angeles shows a marked disparity with respect to the speed \n24  with which loans to African-Americans and Latinos and whites move into foreclosure.  \n25  The average time to foreclosure for African-American borrowers is 2.640 years, and \n26  for Latino borrowers is 2.553 years.  By comparison, the average time to foreclosure \n27  for white borrowers is 3.051 years.  These statistically significant disparities \n28 \n- 34 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 38 of 53   Page ID #:383\n \n1  demonstrate that JPMorgan aggressively moved minority borrowers into foreclosure \n2  as compared with how the Bank handled foreclosures for white borrowers. \n3  101.  This disparity in time to foreclosure is further evidence that JPMorgan is \n4  engaged in lending practices consistent with reverse redlining.  The disparity in time \n5  to foreclosure demonstrates that JPMorgan is engaged in irresponsible underwriting in \n6  African-American and Latino communities that does not serve the best interests of \n7  borrowers.  If JPMorgan were applying the same underwriting practices in African-\n8  American and Latino neighborhoods and white neighborhoods in Los Angeles, there \n9  would not be a significant difference in time to foreclosure.  Were JPMorgan \n10  underwriting borrowers in both communities with equal care and attention to proper \n11  underwriting practices, borrowers in African-American and Latino communities \n12  would not find themselves in financial straits significantly sooner during the lives of \n13  their loans than borrowers in white communities.  The faster time to foreclosure in \n14  African-American and Latino neighborhoods is consistent with underwriting practices \n15  in minority communities that are less concerned with determining a borrower’s ability \n16  to pay and qualifications for the loan than they are in maximizing short-term profit. \n17  102.  The HUD/Treasury Report confirms that time to foreclosure is an \n18  important indicator of predatory practices:  “[t]he speed with which the subprime \n19  loans in these communities have gone to foreclosure suggests that some lenders may \n20  be making mortgage loans to borrowers who did not have the ability to repay those \n21  loans at the time of origination.”32 \n22  3.  Data shows that the discriminatory loan terms cause the foreclosures. \n23  103.  JPMorgan’s discriminatory lending practices cause foreclosures and \n24  vacancies in minority communities in Los Angeles. \n25  104.  Steering borrowers into loans that are less advantageous than loans for \n26  which they qualify, including steering borrowers who qualify for prime loans into \n27 \n                                                 \n32 HUD/Treasury Report at 25. \n28 \n- 35 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 39 of 53   Page ID #:384\n \n1  subprime loans, can cause foreclosures because the borrowers are required to make \n2  higher loan payments.  The difference between what a borrower who is steered in this \n3  manner must pay and the lower amount for which the borrower qualified can cause the \n4  borrower to be unable to make payments on the mortgage.  In such instances, the \n5  borrower would have continued to make payments on the mortgage and remained in \n6  possession of the premises had JPMorgan made the loan without improperly steering \n7  the borrower into a subprime, or less advantageous loan.  Steering borrowers in this \n8  manner, therefore, causes foreclosures and vacancies. \n9  105.  Giving a loan to an applicant who does not qualify for the loan, especially \n10  a refinance or home equity loan, can also cause foreclosures and vacancies.  Some \n11  homeowners live in properties that they own subject to no mortgage.  Other \n12  homeowners live in properties with modest mortgages that they can comfortably \n13  afford to pay.  Where a lender, such as JPMorgan, solicits such a homeowner to take \n14  out a home equity loan on his or her property, or alternatively, to refinance his or her \n15  existing loan into a larger loan without proper underwriting to assure that the borrower \n16  can make the monthly payments for the new, larger loan, the result is likely to be that \n17  the borrower will be unable to make payments on the mortgage.  This is particularly \n18  true where the borrower is refinanced from a fixed-rate loan into an adjustable rate \n19  loan that the lender knows the borrower cannot afford should interest rates rise.  In \n20  some instances, the lender may refinance the borrower into a new loan that the lender \n21  knows the borrower cannot sustain, given the borrower’s present debt obligations and \n22  financial resources.  In such circumstances, the likely result of such practices is to \n23  cause homeowners who are otherwise occupying properties without a mortgage, or \n24  comfortably making payments on a modest existing mortgage, to be unable to make \n25  payment on a new, unaffordable loan.  This, in turn, causes foreclosures and \n26  vacancies.  If these unaffordable refinance and home equity loans had not been made, \n27  the subject properties would not have become vacant. \n28 \n- 36 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 40 of 53   Page ID #:385\n \n1  106.  A regression analysis of loans issued by JPMorgan in Los Angeles from \n2  2004-2011, controlling for objective risk characteristics such as credit history, loan to \n3  value ratio, and the ratio of loan amount to income demonstrates that a predatory loan \n4  is 2.473 times more likely to result in foreclosure than is a non-predatory loan. \n5  107.  The regression analysis further demonstrates that a predatory loan in a \n6  heavily minority neighborhood (census tract consisting of at least 80% African-\n7  American and Latino households) is 8.938 times more likely to result in foreclosure as \n8  is a non-predatory loan with similar risk characteristics in a heavily white \n9  neighborhood (census tract with at least 80% white households).  These odds ratios \n10  demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant differences between African-\n11  American and white borrowers and between Latino and white borrowers. \n12  108.  The regression analysis also demonstrates that a predatory loan made to \n13  an African-American borrower was 4.064 times more likely to result in foreclosure as \n14  was a non-predatory loan made to a white borrower with similar borrower and \n15  underwriting characteristics.  A predatory loan made to a Latino borrower was 4.339 \n16  times as likely to result in foreclosure as was a non-predatory loan made to a white \n17  borrower with similar risk characteristics.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of \n18  statistically significant differences between African-American and white borrowers, \n19  and between Latino and white borrowers. \n20  109.  A regression analysis of government loans (FHA/VA) issued by \n21  JPMorgan in Los Angeles from 2009-2011, controlling for borrower race and \n22  objective risk characteristics such as ratio of loan amount to income, demonstrates that \n23  a government loan is 5.559 times more likely to result in foreclosure as is a non-\n24  government loan.  These odds ratios demonstrate a pattern of statistically significant \n25  differences between African-American and white borrowers and between Latino and \n26  white borrowers. \n27 \n28 \n- 37 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 41 of 53   Page ID #:386\n \n1  VI.  INJURY TO LOS ANGELES CAUSED BY JPMORGAN’S  \nDISCRIMINATORY LOAN PRACTICES  \n2 \n110.  Los Angeles has suffered financial injuries as a direct result of \n3 \nJPMorgan’s pattern or practice of reverse redlining and the resulting \n4 \ndisproportionately high rate of foreclosure on JPMorgan loans to African-Americans \n5 \nand Latinos in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  Los Angeles seeks redress for \n6 \nthese injuries.  The City does not seek redress in this action for injuries resulting from \n7 \nforeclosures on mortgages originated by lenders other than JPMorgan. \n8 \n111.  JPMorgan continues to engage in the discriminatory pattern or practice \n9 \ndescribed herein with similar and continuing deleterious consequences to the City. \n10 \n112.  The City seeks damages based on reduced property tax revenues based on \n11 \n(a) the decreased value of the foreclosed properties themselves, and (b) the decreased \n12 \nvalue of properties surrounding the foreclosed properties.  In addition, the City seeks \n13 \ndamages based on municipal services that it still must provide to remedy blight and \n14 \nunsafe and dangerous conditions which exist at vacant properties that entered \n15 \nforeclosure as a result of JPMorgan’s illegal lending practices. \n16 \nA.  Los Angeles has been Injured by a Reduction in Property Tax Revenues \n17  from Foreclosures Caused by Discriminatory Loans Issued by JPMorgan \n18  113.  As stated in a September 2011 Report by the Alliance of Californians for \n19  Community Empowerment and the California Reinvestment Coalition, entitled The \n20  Wall Street Wrecking Ball:  What Foreclosures are Costing Los Angeles \n21  Neighborhoods (“Cost to Los Angeles Report”), “[w]hen a home falls into foreclosure, \n22  it affects the property value of the foreclosed home as well as the values of other \n23  homes in the neighborhood.”  These decreased property values in turn reduce property \n24  tax revenues to the City. \n25  114.  “As property values drop an estimated $78.8 billion, Los Angeles \n26  communities could lose as much as $481 million in property tax revenue” from the \n27 \n28 \n- 38 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 42 of 53   Page ID #:387\n \n1  decreased value of the foreclosed homes themselves and those in the surrounding \n2  neighborhoods.33 \n3  115.  To be clear, vacancies and short sales even prior to completion of \n4  foreclosure also result in diminished home values.  Indeed, “[i]n 12 states, including \n5  California, Florida, Arizona, New York and New Jersey, pre-foreclosure sales actually \n6  outnumbered REO sales.”34  Such distressed sales reduce property values.35 \n7  1.  The decreased value of the properties foreclosed by JPMorgan result \nin reduced property tax revenues. \n8 \n116.  The Cost to Los Angeles Report states that “[i]t is estimated that homes in \n9 \nforeclosure experience a 22% decline in value.”36 \n10 \n117.  For example, “[t]hat means the impact of the 200,000 foreclosures \n11 \nestimated for the period 2008 through 2011 will be more than $26 billion in lost home \n12 \nvalue in communities across Los Angeles.”37  A portion of this lost home value is \n13 \nattributable to homes foreclosed as a result of JPMorgan’s discriminatory loan \n14 \npractices. \n15 \n118.  The decreased property values of foreclosed homes in turn reduce \n16 \nproperty tax revenues to the City and constitute damages suffered by Los Angeles. \n17 \n2.  The decreased value of properties in the neighborhoods surrounding \n18  foreclosed properties results in reduced property tax revenues. \n19  119.  JPMorgan foreclosure properties and the problems associated with them \n20  likewise cause especially significant declines in surrounding property values because \n21  the neighborhoods become less desirable.  This in turn reduces the property tax \n22  revenues collected by Los Angeles. \n23 \n                                                 \n33 Cost to Los Angeles Report at 3. \n24 \n34 See http://www.realtytrac.com/content/news-and-opinion/short-sales-increasing-\n25  in-2012--short-sale-process----realtytrac-7204. \n35 See http://www.realtytrac.com/content/foreclosure-market-report/us-foreclosure-\n26  sales-and-short-sales-report-q1-2013-7732. \n36 Id. \n27 \n37 Id. \n28 \n- 39 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 43 of 53   Page ID #:388\n \n1  120.  Property tax losses suffered by Los Angeles as a result of JPMorgan’s \n2  foreclosures are fully capable of empirical quantification. \n3  121.  Routinely maintained property tax and other data allow for the precise \n4  calculation of the property tax revenues lost by the City as a direct result of particular \n5  JPMorgan foreclosures.  Using a well-established statistical regression technique that \n6  focuses on effects on neighboring properties, the City can isolate the lost property \n7  value attributable to JPMorgan foreclosures from losses attributable to other causes, \n8  such as neighborhood conditions.  This technique, known as hedonic regression, when \n9  applied to housing markets, isolates the factors that contribute to the value of a \n10  property by studying thousands of housing transactions.  Those factors include the size \n11  of a home, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether the neighborhood is safe, \n12  whether neighboring properties are well-maintained, and more.  Hedonic analysis \n13  determines the contribution of each of these house and neighborhood characteristics to \n14  the value of a home. \n15  122.  The number of foreclosures in a neighborhood is one of the neighborhood \n16  traits that hedonic analysis can examine.  Hedonic analysis allows for the calculation \n17  of the impact on a property’s value of the first foreclosure in close proximity (e.g., ⅛ \n18  or ¼ of a mile), the average impact of subsequent foreclosures, and the impact of the \n19  last foreclosure. \n20  123.  Foreclosures attributable to JPMorgan in minority neighborhoods in Los \n21  Angeles can be analyzed through hedonic regression to calculate the resulting loss in \n22  the property values of nearby homes.  This loss can be distinguished from any loss \n23  attributable to non-JPMorgan foreclosures or other causes.  The loss in property value \n24  in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles attributable to JPMorgan’s unlawful acts \n25  and consequent foreclosures can be used to calculate the City’s corresponding loss in \n26  property tax revenues. \n27 \n28 \n- 40 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 44 of 53   Page ID #:389\n \n1  124.  Various studies establish that hedonic regression can be used for this \n2  purpose.  A study published by the Fannie Mae Foundation, using Chicago as an \n3  example, determined that each foreclosure is responsible for an average decline of \n4  approximately 1.1% in the value of each single-family home within an eighth of a \n5  mile.38 \n6  125.  Other studies have focused on the impact of abandoned homes on \n7  surrounding property values.  A study in Philadelphia, for example, found that each \n8  home within 150 feet of an abandoned home declined in value by an average of \n9  $7,627; homes within 150 to 299 feet declined in value by $6,810; and homes within \n10  300 to 449 feet declined in value by $3,542.39 \n11  126.  These studies highlight the foreseeability of tax related harm to the City \n12  as the result of foreclosures arising from discriminatory loans. \n13  127.  And most recently, the Cost to Los Angeles Report stated, “[i]t is \n14  conservatively estimated that each foreclosed property will cause the value of \n15  neighboring homes within an eighth of a mile to drop 0.9%.”  Thus, “[i]n Los Angeles, \n16  impacted homeowners could experience property devaluation of $53 billion.”  This \n17  decreased property value of neighboring homes in turn reduces property tax revenues \n18  to the City. \n19  128.  Application of such Hedonic regression methodology to data regularly \n20  maintained by Los Angeles can be used to quantify precisely the property tax injury to \n21  the City caused by JPMorgan’s discriminatory lending practices and resulting \n22  foreclosures in minority neighborhoods. \n23   \n24 \n25                                                   \n38 See Dan Immergluck & Geoff Smith, The External Costs of Foreclosure: The \n26  Impact of Single-Family Mortgage Foreclosures on Property Values, 17 HOUSING \nPOLICY DEBATE 57 (2006) at 69. \n27  39 See Anne B.

Los Angeles Is Injured Because It Still Must Provide Costly Municipal \nServices for Properties in Minority Neighborhoods that Have Become \n2  Vacant as a Direct Result of Discriminatory Loans Originated or \nPurchased by JPMorgan \n3 \n129.  Vacant JPMorgan foreclosure properties cause direct costs to the City \n4 \nbecause the City is required to provide increased municipal services at these \n5 \nproperties.  Even prior to completion of the foreclosure process, data shows that 20% \n6 \nof homes are vacated.40  These increased municipal services would not have been \n7 \nnecessary if the properties were occupied. \n8 \n130.  For example, the City’s Police Department must send personnel and \n9 \npolice vehicles to vacant JPMorgan foreclosure properties to respond to public health \n10 \nand safety threats that arise at these properties because the properties are vacant.  \n11 \nBecause violent crime has been found to increase 2.33% for every 1% increase in \n12 \nforeclosures, among other services, LAPD must respond to calls reporting suspicious \n13 \nactivity at vacant properties, perform ongoing investigations involving criminal \n14 \nactivity, including gang activity, at vacant properties. \n15 \n131.  Likewise, the Code Enforcement Bureau of the Los Angeles Building and \n16 \nSafety Department (“Building and Safety Department”) must devote personnel time \n17 \nand out-of-pocket funds to inspect vacant properties and issue orders for violations of \n18 \nthe municipal code to be fixed.  When the municipal code violations are not fixed, the \n19 \nBuilding and Safety Department is required to perform certain services, including, but \n20 \nnot limited to, removing excess vegetation at vacant properties, hauling away trash \n21 \nand debris at vacant properties, boarding vacant property from casual entry, putting up \n22 \nfencing to secure vacant properties, putting up fencing to prevent access to swimming \n23 \npools by young children at vacant properties, coordinating with the Los Angeles \n24 \nCounty Health Department to chemically treat the pools at vacant properties to prevent \n25 \nmosquitos from breeding, painting and removing graffiti at vacant properties, \n26 \n                                                 \n27  40 See http://www.realtytrac.com/content/foreclosure-market-report/owner-vacated-\nforeclosure-update-7771. \n28 \n- 42 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 46 of 53   Page ID #:391\n \n1  condemning and demolishing vacant structures deemed an imminent hazard to public \n2  safety, and having vacant properties frequented by gangs declared a public nuisance \n3  and demolished on that basis. \n4  132.  As stated by the Cost to Los Angeles Report, “[l]ocal government \n5  agencies have to spend money and staff time on blighted foreclosed properties, \n6  providing maintenance, inspections, trash removal, increased public safety calls, and \n7  other code enforcement services …. Responding to these needs is a gargantuan task \n8  that involves multiple agencies and multiple levels of local government.”41 \n9  133.  Moreover, as discussed above, the Apgar-Duda report underscores the \n10  foreseeability of municipal costs as the result of foreclosures arising from \n11  discriminatory loans. \n12  VII.  SAMPLE FORECLOSURE PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF LOS \nANGELES \n13 \n134.  Plaintiff has already identified nine hundred and forty-seven  (947) \n14 \ndiscriminatory loans issued by JPMorgan in Los Angeles between 2004-2011 that \n15 \nresulted in commencement of foreclosure proceedings.42  The City has already \n16 \nincurred, or will incur in the future, damages corresponding to each of these \n17 \nproperties.  A sample of property addresses corresponding to these foreclosures is set \n18 \nforth below: \n19 \n15019 Oswald St., 91342 \n20 \n \n7360 Capps Ave., 91335 \n21 \n \n22 \n11435 Calvert St., 91606 \n \n23 \n24                                                   \n41 Id. at 3. \n25  42 Plaintiff anticipates that it will be able to identify significantly more foreclosures \nresulting from the issuance of discriminatory loans during this time period with the \n26  benefit of discovery.  This conclusion derives from the fact that, because of certain \nreporting limitations, the publicly available mortgage loan databases utilized by \n27  Plaintiff are not as comprehensive as the mortgage loan databases maintained by and \nin the possession of an issuing bank.  \n28 \n- 43 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 47 of 53   Page ID #:392\n \n1  1617 S.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND CONTINUING VIOLATIONS \nDOCTRINE \n11 \n12  135.  As alleged herein, Defendant JPMorgan has engaged in a continuous \n13  pattern and practice of mortgage discrimination in Los Angeles since at least 2004 by \n14  imposing different terms or conditions on a discriminatory and legally prohibited \n15  basis.  In order to maximize profits at the expense of the City of Los Angeles and \n16  minority borrowers, JPMorgan adapted its unlawful discrimination to changing market \n17  conditions.  This unlawful pattern and practice conduct is continuing through the \n18  present and has not terminated.  Therefore, the operative statute of limitations \n19  governing actions brought pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Act has not \n20  commenced to run.  \nIX.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n21 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \n \n(Violation of the Federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601, et seq.) \n23 \n24  136.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference all allegations contained in \n25  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n26  137.  The Fair Housing Act’s stated purpose is to provide, “within \n27  constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States.” \n28 \n- 44 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 48 of 53   Page ID #:393\n \n1  138.  In contravention of that purpose, JPMorgan’s acts, policies, and practices \n2  as described constitute intentional lending discrimination on the basis of race.  \n3  JPMorgan has intentionally targeted residents of predominantly African-American and \n4  Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles for different treatment than residents of \n5  predominantly white neighborhoods in Los Angeles with respect to mortgage lending.  \n6  JPMorgan has intentionally targeted residents of these neighborhoods for high-cost \n7  loans without regard to their credit qualifications and without regard to whether they \n8  qualify for more advantageous loans, including prime loans.  JPMorgan has \n9  intentionally targeted residents of these neighborhoods for increased interest rates, \n10  points, and fees, and for other disadvantageous loan terms including, but not limited \n11  to, adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, and balloon payments.  JPMorgan has \n12  intentionally targeted residents of these neighborhoods for unfair and deceptive \n13  lending practices in connection with marketing and underwriting mortgage loans. \n14  139.  JPMorgan’s acts, policies, and practices have had an adverse and \n15  disproportionate impact on African-Americans and Latinos and residents of \n16  predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles as \n17  compared to similarly situated whites and residents of predominantly white \n18  neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  This adverse and disproportionate impact is the direct \n19  result of JPMorgan’s policies of providing discretion to loan officers and others \n20  responsible for mortgage lending; failing to monitor this discretion to ensure that \n21  borrowers were being placed in loan products on a nondiscriminatory basis when \n22  JPMorgan had notice of widespread product placement disparities based on race and \n23  national origin; giving loan officers and others responsible for mortgage lending large \n24  financial incentives to issue loans to African-Americans and Latinos that are costlier \n25  than better loans for which they qualify; otherwise encouraging and directing loan \n26  officers and others responsible for mortgage lending to steer borrowers into high-cost \n27  loans or loans with adjustable rates, prepayment penalties, or balloon payments \n28 \n- 45 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 49 of 53   Page ID #:394\n \n1  without regard for whether they qualify for better loans; and setting interest rate caps.  \n2  These policies have caused African-Americans and Latinos and residents of \n3  predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles to receive \n4  mortgage loans from JPMorgan that have materially less favorable terms than \n5  mortgage loans given by JPMorgan to similarly situated whites and residents of \n6  predominantly white neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and that are materially more \n7  likely to result in foreclosure. \n8  140.  JPMorgan’s residential lending-related acts, policies, and practices \n9  constitute reverse redlining and violate the Fair Housing Act as: \n10  (a)  Discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in making \n11  available, or in the terms and conditions of, residential real estate-related transactions, \n12  in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a); and \n13  (b)  Discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in the terms, \n14  conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). \n15  141.  JPMorgan’s policies or practices are not justified by business necessity or \n16  legitimate business interests. \n17  142.  JPMorgan’s policies and practices are continuing. \n18  143.  The City is an “aggrieved person” as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 3602(i) and \n19  has suffered damages as a result of JPMorgan’s conduct. \n20  144.  The City’s damages include lost tax revenues and the need to provide \n21  increased municipal services.  The loss of tax revenues at specific foreclosure sites and \n22  at closely neighboring properties in predominantly minority neighborhoods of the City \n23  was a foreseeable consequence that was fairly traceable to JPMorgan’s discriminatory \n24  lending.  Likewise, the need to provide increased municipal services at blighted \n25  foreclosure sites in predominantly minority neighborhoods of the City was a \n26  foreseeable consequence that was fairly traceable to JPMorgan’s discriminatory \n27  lending. \n28 \n- 46 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 50 of 53   Page ID #:395\n \n1  145.  JPMorgan’s policies and practices, as described herein, have and has had \n2  the purpose and effect of discriminating on the basis of race or national origin.  These \n3  policies and practices were intentional, willful, or implemented with reckless disregard \n4  for the rights of African-American and Latino borrowers. \n5  146.  The City has a substantial interest in preventing discriminatory lending \n6  that causes disproportionately minority home foreclosures within its boundaries, in \n7  preventing segregated areas where minority loans are more likely to foreclose, and in \n8  holding banks accountable for damages arising from that discriminatory lending.  \n9  Accordingly, the City’s interests in obtaining injunctive relief to prevent such \n10  discrimination and in remedying the blight and recovering the lost property taxes \n11  resulting from the disproportionately minority home foreclosures in Los Angeles are \n12  directly related to ensuring “fair housing throughout the United States.” \n13  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n14  (Common Law Claim For Restitution Based On California Law) \n15  147.  Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference all allegations contained in \n16  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n17  148.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ predatory lending \n18  practices, Defendant has been enriched at Plaintiff’s expense.  Defendants have failed \n19  to remit those wrongfully obtained benefits or reimburse the City for their costs \n20  improperly caused by Defendants, and retention of the benefits by Defendants would \n21  be unjust without payment. \n22  149.  In addition, to its detriment the City has paid for the Defendants’ \n23  externalities, or Defendants’ costs of harm caused by its mortgage lending \n24  discrimination, in circumstances where Defendants are and have been aware of this \n25  obvious benefit and retention of such benefit would be unjust. \n26  150.  Accordingly, the Court should order restitution, disgorgement of profits, \n27  and/or any other equitable relief deemed appropriate by the Court. \n28 \n- 47 -\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nFOR VIOLATION OF THE FHA \n010346-13  714484 V1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 41   Filed 08/26/14   Page 51 of 53   Page ID #:396\n \n1  DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \n2  Pursuant to Fed.

To the extent any party identifies \n8  issues that it contends make compliance with any of the provisions of this Order \n9  impossible  or  overly  burdensome,  the  parties  shall  meet  and  confer  regarding  an \n10  appropriate and reasonable alternative. \n11   \n12  I.  DEFINITIONS \n13    A.  “Electronically stored information” or “ESI,” as used herein, means \n14  and refers to computer generated information or data of any kind. \n15    B.  “Native data format” means the file in its original creating application, \n16  i.e., including the format(s) in which the producing party has maintained ESI in the \n17  ordinary course of business.   \n18  C.  “Metadata”  means  and  refers  to  information  or  data  about  data,  and \n19  includes without limitation (i) information embedded in or associated with a native file \n20  that is not ordinarily viewable or printable from the application that generated, edited, \n21  or modified such native file which describes the characteristics, origins, and/or usage \n22  of the electronic file and/or (ii) information generated automatically by the operation \n23  of a computer or other information technology system when a native file is created, \n24  modified, transmitted, deleted or otherwise manipulated by a user of such system.   \n25    D.  “Static Image” means or refers to a representation of ESI produced by \n26  converting a native file into a standard image format capable of being viewed and \n27  printed on standard computer systems. \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 3 of 12   Page ID #:775\n \n1    E.  “Documents” includes writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, \n2  sound recordings, images, and other data, data records or data compilations — stored \n3  in any medium from which information can be obtained.  \n4    F.  “Media” means an object or device, real or virtualized, including but not \n5  limited to a disc, tape, computer or other device, on which data is or was stored. \n6  II.  FORMAT OF PRODUCTION \n7  A.  TIFF Image Files.  The Parties agree that all ESI will be produced as \n8  single-page, black-and-white Group IV TIFF image files of at least 300 dpi resolution, \n9  except as provided in section II.H.  Each image file shall be of the form: <Bates \n10  num>.tif where <Bates num> is the BATES number of the page.  Original document \n11  orientation as displayed in the native file should be maintained in the TIFF image \n12  (e.g., portrait to portrait and landscape to landscape).   \n13  B.  Text Files.  Accompanying these TIFF files shall be a multipage text \n14  (.TXT) file containing searchable text from the native file for nonredacted documents \n15  and OCR text for documents that have been redacted.  Each filename shall be of the \n16  form: <Bates num>.txt where <Bates num> is the BATES number of the first page of \n17  the document.  Text shall be encoded in UTF-8.  Load files of the static images should \n18  be created and produced together with their associated static images to facilitate the \n19  use of the produced images by a document management or litigation support database \n20  system (e.g., Opticon OPT or iPRO LFP image load files).  The parties shall meet and \n21  confer  to  the  extent  reasonably  necessary  to  facilitate  the  import  and  use  of  the \n22  produced materials with commercially available document management or litigation \n23  support software. \n24  C.  Production of Structured Data.  To the extent a response to discovery \n25  requires production of discoverable electronic information contained in a database, in \n26  lieu  of  producing  the  database,  the  parties  shall  meet  and  confer  to,  with  an \n27  understanding of which fields are relevant, agree upon a set of queries to be made for \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 4 of 12   Page ID #:776\n \n1  discoverable information and generate a report in a reasonably usable and exportable \n2  electronic  file  (e.g.,  Excel  or  CSV  format)  for  review  by  the  requesting  party  or \n3  counsel.  Upon review of the report(s), the requesting party may make reasonable \n4  requests  for  additional  information  to  explain  the  database  schema,  codes, \n5  abbreviations, and different report formats or to request specific data from identified \n6  fields.  \n7    D.  Production of Physical Documents.  Documents or records that either \n8  were originally generated as ESI but now only exist in physical hard-copy format, and \n9  documents or records that were originally generated in hard-copy format, shall be \n10  converted to a single page .TIFF file and produced following the same protocols set \n11  forth herein or otherwise agreed to by the parties.  OCR will be provided for such \n12  documents.  If, however, the Disclosing Party identifies documents or records for \n13  which OCR would be overly burdensome, the parties shall meet and confer regarding \n14  an appropriate and reasonable alternative.  \n15    E.  Native  Files.    In  accordance  with  section  II.A,  the  parties  agree  that \n16  Documents shall be produced as TIFF images.  The exception to this rule shall be \n17  presentation-application  files  (e.g.,  MS  PowerPoint),  spreadsheet-application  files \n18  (e.g., MS Excel),  multimedia audio/visual files such as voice and video recordings \n19  (e.g., .wav, .mpeg, and .avi files), and other files that are not convertible to a static \n20  image for which all ESI items shall be produced in native format.  Each native file \n21  shall be of the form: <Bates num>.ext where <Bates num> is the BATES number of \n22  the document and .ext is the original native file extension.  In the event a Document \n23  subject to this paragraph requires redaction, it shall be produced in TIFF in accordance \n24  with paragraph II.I below.  If upon review the receiving party believes the production \n25  of such files is inadequate, it shall meet and confer with the producing party regarding \n26  whether an alternate method of redaction would be appropriate. \n27  F.  Document Unitization.  All productions will include data load files and \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 5 of 12   Page ID #:777\n \n1  image  load  files  as  detailed  in  Section  II.L  below.    Each  party  will  designate  its \n2  preferred  format  for  receiving  production documents.    The  parties  shall  meet  and \n3  confer  if  either  believes  the  other’s  preferred  format  is  overly  burdensome, \n4  technologically unfeasible, or cost prohibitive.  The image load file shall reference \n5  each TIFF file in the corresponding production, and the total number of TIFF files \n6  referenced  in  the  load  file  shall  match  the  total  number  of  image  files  in  the \n7  production.  The total number of documents referenced in a production’s data load file \n8  should match the total number of designated document breaks in the corresponding \n9  image load file for that production.   \n10  Format for both plaintiff and defendant productions: \n11  OCR and Extracted Text Files (.TXT Files): \n12  Single text file per document containing all the document's pages  \n \n13  Filenames should be of the form: \n \n14  <Bates num>.txt  \n15  Where <Bates num> is the BATES number of the first page in the \n16  document. \n17  Text must be encoded in UTF-8.  \n \n18  Images Files:  \n19  Single page per image \n \n20  Single image per file  \n \n21   TIFF is default FORMAT unless the file is produced in native format per \n \n22  Section II.E or produced as color JPG or PNG per Section II.H. \n23  Filenames should be of the form: \n \n24  <Bates num>.<ext> \n25  Where <Bates num> is the BATES number of the page, and <ext> is the \n26  appropriate extension for the image format (.jpg, .tif, .png, etc.) \n27  Index Files: \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 6 of 12   Page ID #:778\n \n1  .DAT files (separated by standard Concordance delimiters) \n \n2  First line must contain the column/field names (set forth in Section II.L \n \n3  herein) \n4  Every row must have the same number of columns/fields (empty values \n \n5  are acceptable)   \n6  Text must be encoded in UTF-8  \n \n7  Values must be enclosed by Concordance standard delimiters  \n \n8   \n \n9    G.  Duplicates.    Removal  of  duplicate  documents  shall  be  performed  but \n10  shall only be done on exact duplicate documents on either a custodian basis or a global \n11  basis  (based  on  MD5  or  SHA-1  hash  values  at  the  document  level).    Duplicate \n12  documents will not be removed if they are attached to unique family members (e.g., \n13  where  two  different  e-mails  are  attached  to  the  same  document,  the  MD5  Hash \n14  duplicate attachment will not be removed, as it is attached to different cover e-mails).  \n15  The  producing  party  shall  inform  the  receiving  party  whether  de-duplication  was \n16  performed on a custodian basis or on a global basis.  In addition, the producing party \n17  shall provide a “duplicate custodian” field for each document produced—i.e., a list of \n18  every custodian of the Party who had that document.  \n19    H.  Color.    For  files  not  produced  in  their  native  format,  if  an  original \n20  document contains color, the producing party may produce black and white image(s).  \n21  At the request of the receiving party, the parties shall meet and confer to discuss \n22  production of color image(s) for specific documents. \n23  I.  Bates Numbering and Other Unique Identifiers.  For documents not \n24  produced  in  their  native  format,  each  page  of  a  produced  document  shall  have  a \n25  legible, unique page identifier (“Bates Number”) electronically affixed to the bottom \n26  right hand corner of the TIFF image in such a manner that information from the source \n27  document is not obliterated, concealed, or interfered with.  There shall be no other \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 7 of 12   Page ID #:779\n \n1  legend  or  stamp  placed  on  the  document  image  unless  a  document  qualifies  for \n2  confidential treatment pursuant to the terms of any Protective Order entered by this \n3  Court in this litigation, or has been redacted in accordance with applicable law or \n4  Court order.  In the case of confidential materials as defined in a Protective Order, or \n5  materials redacted in accordance with applicable law or Court order, a designation \n6  may be “affixed” onto the document’s image at the bottom left hand corner of the page \n7  or on top of the redacted text.  Each party should use a different production prefix.  \n8  For any ESI produced in native data format, the producing party shall produce a \n9  single-page TIFF slipsheet indicating that a native item was produced and reflecting \n10  the production Bates number, any confidential designation and text stating “Document \n11  Produced in Native Format.”  .   \n12  In cases where documents to be provided in native format are to be redacted and \n13  cannot be imaged in a readable manner (e.g., Excel spreadsheets), the producing party \n14  may redact the information from the native version of the document (but keeping a \n15  pristine non-redacted image intact and preserved) by replacing the redacted text in the \n16  appropriate  columns,  cells,  or  locations  with  a  black  box.    If  a  party  performs \n17  redactions on native copies of documents, it will notify the receiving party of the Bates \n18  numbers of the documents redacted in this manner in accordance with section II.L. \n19  J.  Production Media.  Documents shall be produced on CD-ROM, DVD, \n20  external hard drive (with standard PC compatible interface), or such other readily \n21  accessible computer or electronic media as the parties may hereafter agree upon (the \n22  “Production  Media”).    Each  item  of  Production  Media  shall  include:  (1)  text \n23  referencing  that  it  was  produced  in  this  lawsuit  (2)  the  production  date,  (3)  the \n24  production volume for the party; and (4) the Bates number range of the materials \n25  contained  on  such  Production  Media  item.    As  an  alternative,  documents  may  be \n26  produced electronically using secured file transport protocols (e.g., SFTP or SSL/TLS \n27  over HTTPS). \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 8 of 12   Page ID #:780\n \n1  K.  Electronic Text Files.  Text files for nonredacted produced documents \n2  shall be produced reflecting the full text that has been electronically extracted from the \n3  original,  native  electronic  files  (“Extracted  Text”).  The  Extracted  Text  shall  be \n4  provided in UTF-8 text format and shall be labeled and produced on Production Media \n5  in accordance with the provisions of paragraph II.J above, “Production Media”.  The \n6  text  files  will  be  named  with  the  unique  Bates  number  of  the  first  page  of  the \n7  corresponding document followed by the extension “.txt.” with the relative pathing to \n8  these text files included in the “index file” on the production media. \n9    L.  Metadata.  The production of Metadata produced will be provided in \n10  connection with native data format ESI requested, and includes without limitation, \n11  file,  application  and  system  metadata,  to  the  extent  reasonably  available.    The \n12  Metadata  fields  identified  below  will  be  extracted  and  produced  (to  the  extent \n13  reasonably available) in a flat delimited text file or .dat format with values enclosed by \n14  Concordance standard delimiters: \n15    Application Name; \n  AttachCount (number of attachments); \n16 \n  Beginning Bates Document Number; \n17    Ending Bates Document Number; \n  BegAttach (the Beginning Bates Document Number of the parent \n18 \ndocument); \n19    EndAttach (the Ending Bates Document Number of the last \nattachment); \n20 \n  Conversation Index; \n21    Custodian; \n  Confidentiality designation; \n22 \n  Redacted (populated “Yes” if document has been redacted); \n23    FileExt (the extension of the filename, e.g., “DOC” for an MS \nWord document); \n24 \n  Filename (the original filename); \n25    Folderpath; \n  FileSize (in KB); \n26 \n  Date and Time Created (“operating-system”-level metadata is \n27  volatile and may not reflect actual document creation date/time)); \n  Date and Time Last Modified; \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 9 of 12   Page ID #:781\n \n1    Author; \n  To/From/Cc/Bcc fields;  \n2 \n  Date and Time Sent; \n3    Date and Time Received; \n  Time Zone Processed (time zone set during data processing); \n4 \n  Email Subject; \n5    MD5 Hash; \n  MessageID (message ID of the email header); \n6 \n  Page Count; \n7    Path to Extracted Text files; \n  Path to Native files;  \n8 \n  Volume (indicative of production volume); and  \n9   \nThe parties are not obligated to populate manually any of these fields if such fields \n10 \ncannot be extracted from a document, with the exception that CUSTODIAN shall be \n11 \npopulated by the producing party to the extent that a custodian can be identified. \n12 \n  M.  Attachments.  Email attachments and embedded files or links must be \n13 \nmapped to their parent by the inclusion of the BegAttach and End Attach fields.  The \n14 \nBegAttach field should list the first page of the parent document and the End Attach \n15 \nfiled should list the last page of the last attachment.  \n16 \nN.  Compressed Files.  Compression file types (i.e., .CAB, .GZ, .TAR, .Z, \n17 \n.ZIP) shall be decompressed in a reiterative manner to ensure that a zip within a zip is \n18 \ndecompressed  into  the  lowest  possible  compression  resulting  in  individual  folders \n19 \nand/or files. \n20 \nIII.   OBJECTIONS TO ESI PRODUCTION \n21 \nA.  For responsive files not produced in their native format, documents that \n22 \npresent  imaging  or  format  production  problems  shall  be  promptly  identified  and \n23 \ndisclosed to the  requesting party; the parties shall then meet and confer to attempt to \n24 \nresolve the problems. \n25 \nB.  If  either  party  objects  to  producing  the  requested  information  on  the \n26 \ngrounds that such information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or \n27 \ncost, or because production in the requested format is asserted to be not reasonably \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 10 of 12   Page ID #:782\n \n1  accessible because of undue burden or cost, before asserting such an objection, the \n2  responding party will inform the requesting party of the format in which it is willing to \n3  produce it, the nature and location of the information claimed to not be reasonably \n4  accessible, and/or the reason(s) why the requested form of production would impose \n5  an undue burden or is unreasonably costly, and afford the requesting party opportunity \n6  to propose an alternative means of compliance with the request. Such proposal may \n7  include alternative cost estimates for ESI discovery production, may offer a proposal \n8  for ESI discovery cost allocation, or both.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein \n9  to the contrary, a producing party shall not produce ESI in a format not requested or \n10  designated by the requesting party unless (i) the parties have met and conferred, and, \n11  having been unable to resolve such format production conflict at such meet and confer \n12  session, (ii) prior to referral to and resolution of such issue by the court. \n13  C.  ESI of Limited Accessibility.  If a Producing Party contends that any \n14  responsive ESI, excluding back-up tapes or other long-term storage media that were \n15  created for use as a disaster recovery mechanism, is not reasonably accessible within \n16  the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(B), that Party shall timely identify such ESI \n17  with reasonable particularity and shall provide the Requesting Party with the basis for \n18  declining to produce such ESI, including but not limited to information about the \n19  nature  of  any  limitations  on  access,  an  estimate  of  the  likely  costs  that  might  be \n20  incurred in producing such ESI, the method used for storage of ESI (for example, the \n21  type of system used to store the ESI), and/or where such ESI is kept.  The parties agree \n22  that back-up tapes or other long-term storage media that were created for use as a \n23  disaster recovery mechanism are presumed not to be reasonably accessible within the \n24  meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(B) and, absent a particular discovery dispute \n25  concerning  such  materials,  do  not  need  to  be  identified  as  described  above.    The \n26  parties shall negotiate in good faith concerning the production of any such ESI.  If the \n27  Parties are unable to reach agreement, the Parties shall submit any dispute to the \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 11 of 12   Page ID #:783\n \n1  Court,  who  shall  determine  what  burden  may  be  imposed  upon  the  Producing  or \n2  Requesting Parties to resolve the dispute and whether or to what extent the costs of \n3  such production shall be borne by the Producing or Requesting Parties. \n4  IV.  CATEGORIES OF ESI DISCOVERABLE ONLY UPON A SHOWING \nOF GOOD CAUSE \n5 \nThe following categories of ESI are discoverable only upon a showing of good \n6 \ncause:  (1) “deleted,” “slack,” “fragmented,” or “unallocated” data on hard drives; (2) \n7 \nrandom access memory (RAM) or other ephemeral data; (3) on-line access data such \n8 \nas temporary internet files, history, cache, cookies, etc.; (4) data in metadata fields that \n9 \nare  frequently  updated  automatically,  such  as  last-opened  dates;  (5)  e-mails  and \n10 \nstructured data on systems no longer regularly in use by the Party in the normal course \n11 \nof  their  business,  provided  that  such  data  is  not  reasonably  accessible  within  the \n12 \nmeaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(B); and (6) data on backup tapes. \n13 \nV.  MISCELLANEOUS \n14 \nA.  Nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  to  affect  the  discoverability  or \n15 \nadmissibility  of  any  Document  or  data.    All  objections  to  the  discoverability  or \n16 \nadmissibility of any Document or data are preserved and may be asserted at any time. \n17 \nB.  The  enumeration  of  a  protocol  for  the  production,  processing,  or \n18 \ntreatment of ESI in any particular format or from any particular source of ESI shall not \n19 \nbe construed as a concession that such formats or sources of ESI contain reasonably \n20 \nretrievable or relevant data or that they must be searched in response to the document \n21 \nrequests or in response to any particular document request. \n22 \nC.  This  Stipulated  Order  is  not  intended  to  govern  any  protections  or \n23 \nrestrictions related to the production of privileged litigation material.  The Parties have \n24 \nseparately addressed the process for handling the production of privileged litigation \n25 \nmaterials in the Stipulated Protective Order. \n26 \nD.  Limited  28  U.S.C.  §  1920  Waiver.    While  neither  party  is  taking  a \n27 \nposition in this document that e-discovery costs under 18 U.S.C. § 1920 are taxable or \n28 \n   \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-04168-ODW-RZ   Document 62   Filed 03/24/15   Page 12 of 12   Page ID #:784\n \n1  not, the parties agree that if a party seeks e-discovery costs under 18 U.S.C. § 1920, \n2  that party will not seek the reimbursement of any costs relating to the production, \n3  storage, and maintenance of the ESI produced by that party in TIFF format over native \n4  format.  \n5  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n6   \n7  DATED: 3/24/15         By: ____________________________________ \n8              HONORABLE RALPH ZAREFSKY \n            UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n9 \n \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n   \n ",
