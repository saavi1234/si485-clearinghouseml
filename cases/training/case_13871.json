The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the TSA's administration and management of the \"No-Fly List\" violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Search and Seizure Clause of the Fourth Amendment. The TSA began implementing the No-Fly List in November 2001 and circulates the list to commercial airlines and security personnel with instructions to detain and question any passenger whose name matches or is similar to one on the No-Fly List. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that many innocent passengers were routinely stopped, questioned, and searched because of the list. The TSA and DHS would not reveal why individuals were on the list and passengers had no meaningful opportunity to clear their names.</p><p>On January 7, 2005, Judge Thomas S. Zilly granted the TSA and DHS's motion to dismiss because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction over all of the passengers' claims except for the Fifth Amendment Due Process claims as it related to the clearance procedures established by the TSA. However, Judge Zilly dismissed that remaining claim because the passengers failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Green v. Transportation Security Administration, 351 F.

Stone, Department of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, \nDefendants. \nORDER \nZILLY, District Judge. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThis matter comes before the Court on Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction and Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted, docket no. 15. The Court heard oral \nargument on these motions on November 4, 2004, and took the matter under \nadvisement. The Court now, being fully advised, enters the following Order. \n\nII. BACKGROUND \nThe Transportation Security Administration (\"TSA\"), an agency within the United \nStates Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for security in all modes of \ntransportation. Longmire Decl., docket 16, ¶ 3. As part of its statutory mandate with \nrespect to aviation security, the TSA is required to provide for the screening for \nweapons, explosives, and other destructive substances, of all passengers and \nproperty that will be carried on passenger aircraft. To further these purposes, the \nTSA has implemented regulations requiring each aircraft operator to adopt security \nprograms. When the TSA determines that additional security measures (in addition \nto the security programs) are necessary, it issues \"Security Directives\" to regulated \naircraft operators. Id. at ¶ 5. Compliance by air carriers with Security Directives and \nemergency amendments is mandatory. \nTSA has established Security Directives relating to two groups of individuals who \nhave been assessed to pose a risk to aviation safety. The first group, identified on a \n\"No-Fly List,\" consists of individuals who are prohibited from flying altogether. The \nsecond group, identified on a \"Selectee List,\" consists of individuals who must be \n\"selected\" by air carriers for additional screening before they are permitted to fly. The \nSecurity Directives also prescribe the procedures to be followed, and the specific \nsecurity measures to be taken by air carriers, when individuals identified on the No-\nFly or Selectee lists seek to board an aircraft. Id. at ¶ 7. In this Order, both the \"No-\nFly List\" and the \"Selectee List\" are collectively referred to as the \"No-Fly List.\" \nThe Defendants distribute updated versions of the No-Fly List, as attachments to \nSecurity Directives and Emergency Amendments, to commercial airlines \noperating1122*1122 within the United States. The No-Fly List is also distributed to \nairport security personnel, customs and immigration agents, and other federal law-\nenforcement agencies. For security reasons, the TSA will not divulge the specific \nsecurity measures followed by air carriers when they encounter an individual \nidentified on the No-Fly List. Longmire Decl., docket 16, ¶ 9. \nPlaintiffs commenced this action on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated \nindividuals to challenge TSA's adoption, maintenance, dissemination, administration, \nand management of both the No-Fly List and the Selectee List.[1] \nPlaintiffs allege they are innocent passengers with no links to terrorist activity, but \nhave names similar or identical to names on the No-Fly List. Compl., docket no. 1, ¶ \n3. Plaintiffs allege that when they travel by air, they are mistakenly identified by \n\nairport personnel, often in full view of co-workers and the general traveling public, as \nindividuals whose names actually appear on the No-Fly List. As a result, Plaintiffs \nallege that airline personnel subjected them to enhanced security screening, \nincluding physical pat-downs, wanding, and physical searches of luggage. Plaintiffs \nallege that they do not feel free to leave. To date, no named Plaintiff has missed a \nflight or been subjected to enhanced screening for more than one hour. \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants have failed to disclose basic questions such as the \ncriteria for placing names on or removing names from the No-Fly List, procedures for \namending information on the No-Fly List, or rules for maintaining or managing the \nNo-Fly List. \nThe TSA has instituted an ombudsman process whereby individuals can contest \ntheir placement on the No-Fly List. Defendants have submitted documents which \ndescribe the clearance process administered by the Office of the \nOmbudsman. SeeNotice of Filing, docket no. 26, Ex. A. However, Plaintiffs allege \nthat the ombudsman process is not publicized, and individuals who are mistakenly \nassociated with the No-Fly List are told that there is no recourse. \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants' actions in maintenance, management, and \ndissemination of the No-Fly list are unconstitutional. Plaintiffs specifically allege that \nthe Defendants have \"deprive[d] Plaintiffs of liberty and property interests protected \nby the Fifth Amendment\" and have \"subjected [Plaintiffs] to unreasonable searches \nand seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\" Compl., docket no. 1, pp. 26-27. \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the maintenance, management, and \ndissemination of the No-Fly List is unconstitutional, and seek to require Defendants \nto remedy the due process and Fourth Amendment defects of the No-Fly List. Id. at \np. 27. \nDefendants have moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction. Defendants contend that the Security Directives are final orders issued \nby the TSA, and that any action for judicial review must be filed with the Court of \nAppeals. In the alternative, Defendants have moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for \nfailure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. See D. Mot. to Dismiss, \ndocket no. 15. \n1123*1123 By Minute Order dated October 29, 2004, docket no. 25, the Court \nordered Defendants to submit for in camera and ex parte review the following: \n\n(a) A copy of the applicable Security Directives; \n(b) A copy of the ombudsman processes available for expunging innocent \npassengers' names from the No-Fly List; \n(c) A copy of the procedures used for processing Passenger Identity Verification \nForms. \nPursuant to the Court's Order, on November 2, 2004, Defendants submitted six \nSecurity Directives procedures, portions of the No-Fly List and Selectee List, the \nApplicable Policy Memorandum dated July 9, 2004 and April 22, 2003, and certain \nother materials. The Court has reviewed the Defendants' submissions in camera and \nthese documents have been filed under seal. \nIII. ANALYSIS OF JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES \n(A) Special Review Statutes for Orders under the Federal Aviation Act. \nCongress has enacted a special review statute for final orders of the Secretary of \nTransportation promulgated under the Federal Aviation Act. The applicable statute at \nissue, 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a), relating to judicial review, provides, in part, as follows: \n[A] person disclosing a substantial interest in an order issued by the Secretary of \nTransportation (or the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security with respect to \nsecurity duties and powers designated to be carried out by the Under Secretary or \nthe Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration with respect to aviation \nduties and powers designated to be carried out by the Administrator) in whole or in \npart under this part, part B, or subsection (l) or (s) of section 114 may apply for \nreview of the order by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United \nStates for the circuit in which the person resides or has its principal place of \nbusiness. The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is issued.[2] \nSection 46110(a) and its predecessor statute found at § 1486(a) are \"not to be given \na narrow, technical reading; instead it is to be interpreted expansively.\" San Diego \nAir Sports Center, Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 887 F.2d 966, 968 (9th \nCir.1989)(approving a similar interpretation of the predecessor statute by the Fourth, \nSeventh, Eighth and District of Columbia Circuits). The San Diego Air Sports court \nstated that it agreed with other courts that \"the purposes of special review statutes — \n\ncoherence and economy — are best served if courts of appeal exercise their \nexclusive jurisdiction over final agency actions.\" Id. (quoting Sima Prods. Corp. v. \nMcLucas, 612 F.2d 309, 313 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 908, 100 S.Ct. 1834, \n64 L.Ed.2d 260 (1980)) (emphasis added). Thus, \"the court of appeals' jurisdiction is \nexclusive with regard to review of final FAA action.\" Clark v. Busey, 959 F.2d 808, \n811 (9th Cir.1992). \nPlaintiffs raise two arguments in favor of district court jurisdiction. First, Plaintiffs \nargue that the Security Directives are not \"final orders\" within the meaning of § \n46110. Second, even if they constitute final orders, jurisdiction is proper because (a) \nthe agency decision did not consider the claims raised by Plaintiffs, and (b) Plaintiffs \nraise broad constitutional challenges. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that \nin 1124*1124 the event the Court considers the declaration of Lee Longmire, docket \nno. 16, regarding this Court's jurisdiction, the motion to dismiss should be converted \ninto a motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs further argue that in such event, \nPlaintiffs would be entitled to the following discovery, as outlined in the Shuford \ndeclaration, docket no. 19, before having to respond to the motion: \n• Investigation regarding whether the Longmire Affidavit accurately describes the \nSecurity Directives; \n• Investigation regarding whether the Security Directives address the problems \nasserted by plaintiffs regarding inaccurate listings or mistaken identity; \n• Investigation regarding the process used to create the Security Directives; \n• Investigation regarding the authorship of the Security Directives; \n• Investigation regarding what, if any, agency procedures were available to consider \nthe types of constitutional challenges asserted by plaintiffs; and \n• Investigation regarding whether there was notice and opportunity to be heard \nbefore defendants issued the Security Directives. \nSee Shuford Decl., docket no. 19, ¶ 3. \nWhen resolving a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the Court \nmay look beyond the Complaint to matters of public record without having to convert \nthe motion into one for summary judgment. White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th \n\nCir.2000). In this case, the Court has considered the declaration of Lee Longmire, \ndocket no. 16. The declaration contains substantial facts within the public \nrecord.See Longmire Decl., docket no. 16, ¶¶ 1-8. However, the declaration also \nstates that in view of the sensitive nature of the Security Directives, they cannot be \nfurther described on the public record. The Court has also reviewed the documents \nsubmitted by the government, at the Court's request, for in camera and ex \npartereview. The Court will not consider, for purposes of the motion to dismiss for \nlack of personal jurisdiction, the non-public records reviewed in camera. The \nPlaintiffs' motion to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary \njudgment, and to allow discovery, is DENIED. \n(B) The Security Directives and No-Fly Lists are final orders within the meaning of § \n46110(a). \nSection 46110 authorizes appellate review of \"orders,\" which has been interpreted in \nthe Ninth Circuit as follows: \n`Order' carries a note of finality, and applies to any agency decision which imposes \nan obligation, denies a right, or fixes some legal relationship. In other words, if the \norder provides a `definitive' statement of the agency's position, has a `direct and \nimmediate' effect on the day-to-day business of the party asserting wrongdoing, and \nenvisions `immediate compliance with its terms,' the order has sufficient finality to \nwarrant the appeal offered by section [46110]. \nCrist v. Leippe, 138 F.3d 801, 804 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting Mace v. Skinner, 34 F.3d \n854, 857 (9th Cir.1994)) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \nThe No-Fly List and the Selectee List are Security Directives issued by TSA \npursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 114(l)(2)(A), which authorizes the TSA to issue Security \nDirectives without providing notice or the opportunity for comment in order to protect \ntransportation security. These Security Directives provide a definitive statement of \nthe TSA position and have a direct and immediate effect on persons listed on the \nNo-Fly List, barring travel on commercial aircraft. Each aircraft operator is required \nby law to comply immediately 1125*1125 with Security Directives. 49 CFR § \n1544.305(b). \nPlaintiffs' argument that the Security Directives are not orders within the meaning of \nSection 46110 because the TSA has not created or published findings of fact or \notherwise created an administrative record is without merit. In San Diego Air \n\nSports,887 F.2d at 970, the court held a letter from the FAA providing that \nparachuting would not be allowed in the San Diego Terminal Control area was an \norder, even though the record consisted of little more than the letter. See \nalso Southern California Aerial Advertisers' Ass'n v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 881 F.2d \n672, 676 (9th Cir.1989) (letter from FAA prohibiting fixed wing aircraft over Los \nAngeles Airport was final order even though the entire administrative record in this \ncase consisted of the letter and the FAA proposal). To be deemed final, the Security \nDirectives need not result from lengthy administrative proceedings; rather, the \nSecurity Directives must only impose an obligation or define some legal right. \nFurthermore, § 46110(a) grants the courts of appeal exclusive jurisdiction over \norders that were issued without any form of adjudication. In 2003, Congress \namended § 46110 and authorized the courts of appeal to review orders so long as \nthe orders are promulgated \"under this part, part B, or subsection (l) or (s) of section \n114.\" 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a). See also Pub.L. No. 108-176, § 228, 117 Stat. 2490, \n2532 (Dec. 12, 2003). Section 114(l)(2)(A) allows the TSA to issue security \ndirectives \"without providing notice or an opportunity for comment.\" 49 U.S.C. § \n114(l) (2)(A). Thus, Congress clearly intended the courts of appeal to review Security \nDirectives issued absent any form of adjudication, and Plaintiffs' arguments to the \ncontrary are without merit. \nThe Security Directives are \"orders\" for the purposes of § 46110(a), and the courts of \nappeal have exclusive jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims relating to them. Clark,959 \nF.2d at 811.[3] Thus, to the extent these Security Directives establish a No-Fly List of \npersons who are prohibited from flying, or create a Selectee List resulting in persons \nwho will be selected for additional enhanced screening and resulting delays, this \nCourt has no subject matter jurisdiction. \nIn contrast, to the extent Plaintiffs challenge the procedures administered by the \nOffice of the Ombudsman, to allow plaintiffs with names identical or similar to names \non the No-Fly List to be cleared, the procedures are not \"orders\" within the meaning \nof § 46110(a). Rather, the clearance procedures are voluntary procedures which \nallow individuals who are delayed as a result of enhanced screening to attempt to \nexpedite future airline check-in procedures. These procedures allow interested \npersons, including Plaintiffs, to avoid the heightened screening procedures. Because \nthese procedures are not \"orders\" within the meaning of § 46110, the Court has \njurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment Due Process claims relative to \nthese procedures. \n\n(C) Plaintiffs' Broad Constitutional Challenges \nPlaintiffs contend that even if the Security Directives are \"orders\" within the meaning \nof § 46110, this Court also has jurisdiction because Plaintiffs raise broad \nconstitutional challenges to the Security Directives. The question presented is \nwhether Plaintiffs' claims are \"inescapably 1126*1126 intertwined\" with a review of \nthe procedures and merits surrounding the Security Directives, or raise broad \nconstitutional challenges which do not require a review of the procedures and merits \nof the Security Directives themselves. Crist, 138 F.3d at 803; Mace, 34 F.3d at 858. \nIf the challenge is inescapably intertwined with a review of the procedures and merits \nsurrounding the Security Directives, jurisdiction is solely with the courts of \nappeal.Greenwood v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 28 F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir.1994); Tur v. \nFed. Aviation Admin., 104 F.3d 290, 291-92 (9th Cir.1997).[4] On the other hand, if \nthe claims raise broad constitutional challenges that are not inescapably intertwined \nwith the Security Directives, this Court would have jurisdiction to consider the issues \nraised notwithstanding the fact that they constitute orders within the meaning of § \n46110. Crist, 138 F.3d at 803. The Ninth Circuit has clearly set forth the question to \nbe answered to determine jurisdiction for broad constitutional challenges. However, \nthe application of the guiding principles announced in these decisions is more \nproblematic. A close review of the Plaintiffs' claims is therefore necessary and \ninstructive. \n(1) Count I: Violation of Fifth Amendment Right to Due Process. \nPlaintiffs' Complaint raises a broad constitutional attack against the TSA's \nadministration and maintenance of the No-Fly List under the Fifth \nAmendment. SeeCompl., docket no. 1, ¶¶ 104-05. More specifically, Plaintiffs allege \nin Count I that individuals whose names are identical or similar to those on the No-\nFly List are \"stigmatized and subjected to interrogations, delays, enhanced body and \nluggage searches, detentions, and/or other travel impediments,\" and that these \n\"deprivations are without due process of law because Defendants have failed to \nprovide constitutionally adequate mechanisms for Plaintiffs to avoid being subjected \nto the stigma, interrogations, delays, enhanced searches, detentions, and/or other \ntravel impediments associated with having a name identical or similar to a name on \nthe No-Fly List.\" Id. at ¶¶ 104-05. As a result, Plaintiffs allege they have been \ndeprived of liberty and property interests protected by the Fifth Amendment. Id. at ¶ \n105. \n(2) Count II: Violation of the Fourth Amendment \n\nIn Count II, Plaintiffs allege that \"Defendants actions in administrating and \nmaintaining the No-Fly List cause plaintiffs to be subjected to unreasonable \nsearches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\" Id. at 27. \n(3) Relief Sought by Plaintiffs \nPlaintiffs' Complaint seeks broad equitable relief to modify the Security Directives in \na fashion to make them constitutional. However, at oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel \nsubstantially narrowed the remedy sought, as follows: Plaintiffs' counsel conceded \nthat (a) Plaintiffs do not challenge the adoption of the Security Directives or the \nprocedures followed before they were implemented, Transcript, docket no. 29, 42:5-\n9, or the government's right to issue a Security Directive that says certain people \nshould be on a No-Fly List, id. at 32:21-33:2; and (b) Plaintiffs do not challenge the \ngovernment's decision that, if someone has a name similar to someone who is on \nthe No-Fly List, \"that there 1127*1127 should be additional security to that \nperson.\" Id. at 33:4-10. \nThe gist of what Plaintiffs do challenge in this litigation is the enhanced scrutiny and \nresulting delays incurred by the Plaintiffs who have identical or similar names to \npersons on the No-Fly List. Plaintiffs' counsel stated this narrowed focus at oral \nargument as follows: \nwe are seeking some remedy that would allow Plaintiffs to avoid the ongoing and \nrepeated investigations, interrogations, detention, delays and enhanced searches \nthat they've experienced virtually every time they fly. \nId. at 28:6-13. \nA careful review of Plaintiffs' claims in their Complaint demonstrates that Plaintiffs \nadvance three basic challenges to the Security Directives: (1) the adoption, \nmaintenance, and dissemination of the No-Fly List violates the Fourth and Fifth \nAmendments; (2) the heightened security screening measures that Plaintiffs were \nsubjected to resulted in unconstitutional seizures in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment; and (3) that Defendants failed to provide constitutionally adequate \nremedial procedures in violation of the Fifth Amendment. \n(4) Analysis of Claims and Relief Sought \n\nPlaintiffs' challenge to the adoption, maintenance, and dissemination of the No-Fly \nList under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments is inescapably intertwined with a review \nof the procedures and merits surrounding the adoption of the No-Fly List. Plaintiffs' \nchallenge here, to the extent it remains after the concessions at oral argument, \nwould involve a direct challenge to the adoption and maintenance of the Security \nDirectives.Greenwood, 28 F.3d at 975; Crist, 138 F.3d at 803. As a result, this Court \ndoes not have jurisdiction to consider these alleged constitutional challenges. \nPlaintiffs' challenge to the heightened security measures under the Fourth \nAmendment is also inescapably intertwined with a review of the Security Directives. \nThe TSA is required to \"identify individuals on passenger lists who may be a threat to \ncivil aviation or national security,\" and when such an individual is identified, to \nprevent him or her \"from boarding an aircraft\" or \"take appropriate action....\" 49 \nU.S.C. § 114(h)(3). The TSA is authorized to issue Security Directives prescribing \nspecific security measures when such measures \"are necessary to respond to a \nthreat assessment or a specific threat against civil aviation.\" 49 C.F.R. § \n1544.305(a). Security Directives also include instructions to air carriers of the \nsecurity procedures to be followed when individuals identified on the No-Fly List \nattempt to board commercial aircraft. Longmire Decl., docket no. 16, ¶¶ 4-9. \nPlaintiffs allege that by having names similar or identical to names on the No-Fly \nList, they are subjected to unconstitutional searches and seizures, and Plaintiffs \nargue that their allegations are broad constitutional challenges to this agency action. \nHowever, Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claims are distinguishable from the claims \ninCrist and Mace, where the plaintiffs brought broad constitutional challenges that \nwere severable from the merits of the order revoking their licenses. Here, Plaintiffs \ndo not challenge agency procedures in promulgating the Security Directives. \nPlaintiff's Fourth Amendment claims challenge the merits of the security and \nscreening procedures mandated by the Security Directives, and any adjudication of \nPlaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claims is inescapably intertwined with a review of the \nSecurity Directives. Furthermore, Plaintiffs ask this Court to remedy \nthe 1128*1128 alleged Fourth Amendment defects in the No-Fly List by issuing an \ninjunction requiring Defendants to modify or amend the challenged security and \nscreening procedures. Compl., docket no. 1, at 27. Thus, Plaintiffs' Fourth \nAmendment claims necessarily would involve a review of the security and screening \nprocedures mandated by the Security Directives, and jurisdiction to challenge these \nissues is exclusively limited to the courts of appeal pursuant to statute. 49 U.S.C. § \n46110; Crist, 138 F.3d at 803. \n\nFinally, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have failed to provide constitutionally \nadequate remedial procedures in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs \ncorrectly argue that the TSA Ombudsman Clearance Procedures do not constitute \n\"orders\" for the purposes of § 46110. The Ombudsman Clearance Procedures have \nestablished a voluntary procedure whereby individuals may attempt to expedite \nfuture check-in procedures. Thus, the Court has jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' \nFifth Amendment due process claim. \nAs a result, and for the reasons stated in this Order, this Court does not have \njurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' claims in Count I relating to the administering and \nmaintaining of the No-Fly List, or any resulting liberty or property interest protected \nby the Fifth Amendment. Similarly, this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider \nPlaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claims in Count II of the Complaint. Defendants' motion \nto dismiss these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is GRANTED. However, \nto the extent Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim challenges the Ombudsman \nClearance Procedures, this Court does have subject matter jurisdiction because \nsuch procedures do not constitute orders. It will therefore be necessary to address \nDefendants' Second Motion to Dismiss this remaining claim for failure to state a \nclaim on which relief can be granted. \nIV. DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM \nThe Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall be deprived of a liberty or \nproperty interest without due process of law. U.S. CONST. Amend V. Plaintiffs \ncontend they have been deprived of a constitutionally protected liberty and property \ninterest. Plaintiffs contend that \"the government stigmatized plaintiffs by identifying \nthem on the No-Fly Lists, and, as a result, plaintiffs were treated as suspected \nterrorists.\" Opposition brief, docket no. 18, at 10. Plaintiffs complain that adequate \nprocess is not available to provide clearance for persons who have been mistakenly \nidentified in the No-Fly Lists. Although Defendants have instituted an ombudsman \nprocess to provide clearance, Plaintiffs allege these procedures do not provide \nadequate notice or a meaningful opportunity to clear their names. Complaint, docket \nno. 1, ¶¶ 30, 34, 50, 64-66. Defendants have served and filed publicly available \ndocuments that describe the expedited No-Fly List and Selectee List Clearance \nProcess, administered by the Office of the Ombudsman of the TSA. See Notice of \nSubmission, docket no. 26. Defendants have submitted evidence that three of the \nnamed Plaintiffs have been \"cleared\" through the TSA Ombudsman process. \nSeveral other Plaintiffs have failed to use the procedures established by the \n\nOmbudsman process. All Plaintiffs allege the procedures are inadequate and violate \nthe Fifth Amendment. \nPlaintiffs raise a constitutional challenge to the procedures after the No-Fly Lists \nhave been promulgated. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have \"failed to provide \nconstitutionally adequate mechanisms for 1129*1129 Plaintiffs to avoid being \nsubjected to the stigma, interrogations, delays, enhanced searches, detentions, \nand/or other travel impediments associated with having a name identical or similar to \na name on the No-Fly List,\" Complaint, docket no. 1, ¶ 105. Thus, Plaintiffs have \nalleged a violation of their due process rights.[5] \nDefendants contend that unless Plaintiffs can establish a protected \"property\" or \n\"liberty\" interest protected by the Fourth Amendment, the Court need not address \nwhether the government procedures comport with due process. To make out a claim \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Plaintiffs must show: (1) a \ndeprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest; and (2) a denial \nof adequate procedural protections. Hufford v. McEnaney, 249 F.3d 1142, 1150 (9th \nCir.2001). \"The first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the plaintiff \nhas been deprived of a protected interest in `property' or `liberty.'\" American Mfr. \nMut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 59, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999). \nPlaintiffs do not argue that they were deprived of a property interest. Instead, \nPlaintiffs argue that the alleged searches and seizures deprived them of liberty \ninterests protected by the Fourth Amendment. To the extent Plaintiffs base their Fifth \nAmendment claim on the heightened security measures prescribed by the Security \nDirectives, the Court does not have jurisdiction to consider the claim. However, \nPlaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim is also based on the stigma-plus doctrine. \nTo prevail on a claim under the stigma-plus doctrine, Plaintiffs must show (1) public \ndisclosure of a stigmatizing statement by the government, the accuracy of which is \ncontested; plus (2) the denial of some more tangible interest such as employment,' \nor the alteration or a right or status recognized by state law. Ulrich v. City & County \nof San Francisco, 308 F.3d 968, 982 (9th Cir.2002) (citing Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. \n693, 701, 711, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976)). \"[T]he `plus' must be a \ndeprivation of a liberty or property interest by the state that directly affects the \nplaintiffs' rights.\"Miller v. Cal. Dep't of Soc. Services, 355 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th \nCir.2004). \nPlaintiffs sufficiently plead that there have been stigmatizing statements made by \ngovernment officials, the accuracy of which is uncontested. When a statement \"might \n\nseriously damage [the Plaintiffs'] standing and associations in [their] community,\" it is \nsufficiently stigmatizing for the purpose of a stigma-plus analysis. Vanelli v. Reynolds \nSch. Dist. No. 7, 667 F.2d 773, 777 n. 5 (9th Cir.1982). Plaintiffs all allege that they \nhave been publicly associated with the No-Fly List. See Compl., docket no. 1, ¶¶ 23, \n41, 54, 60, 62, 72, 81, 86, 89, 90, 94. As Plaintiffs point out, there can be little doubt \nthat association with a government terrorist watch-list \"might seriously damage \n[Plaintiffs'] standing and associations in [their] community,\" Vanelli, 667 F.2d at 777 \nn. 5, and Defendants have not argued otherwise. \nHowever, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the \"plus\" prong of the stigma-plus \ndoctrine. 1130*1130The \"plus\" prong is \"the denial of `some more tangible interest[ ] \nsuch as employment,' or the alteration of a right or status recognized by state \nlaw.\" Ulrich,308 F.3d at 982 (quoting Paul, 424 U.S. at 701, 711, 96 S.Ct. 1155). \nPlaintiffs argue that the \"plus\" factor need not amount to a constitutional violation. \nIndeed, courts have found the \"plus\" factor satisfied in a variety of contexts. \nIn Soranno's Gasco, Inc. v. Morgan, 874 F.2d 1310, 1316-17 (9th Cir.1989), the \ncourt found the \"plus\" factor satisfied when an individual's business was injured as a \nresult of a stigmatizing statement by government officials. In Ulrich, the court found \nthe \"plus\" factor satisfied when an employer refused to rehire an individual, even \nwhen the individual had no enforceable right, under either state or federal law, to \nreinstatement.308 F.3d at 982-83. In Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, \n435, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971), the Supreme Court found a due process \nviolation under the stigma-plus theory where the stigma resulted in the individual's \ninability to purchase alcohol. However, all the cases applying the stigma-plus \ndoctrine are accompanied by some additional deprivation of liberty or property. Thus, \nthe \"plus\" \"must be a deprivation of liberty or property ... that directly affects the \n[Plaintiffs'] rights.\" Miller v. Cal. Dept. of Soc. Services, 355 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th \nCir.2004). \nPlaintiffs, in the present matter, argue that their status has been altered because \nthey are no longer able to travel like other airline passengers because of their \nalleged association with the No-Fly List. While Plaintiffs have a right to travel \nthroughout the United States \"uninhibited by statutes, rules, and regulations which \nunreasonably burden or restrict movement,\" Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 499, 119 \nS.Ct. 1518, 143 L.Ed.2d 689 (1999), it is also true that \"burdens on a single mode of \ntransportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel.\" Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d \n1202, 1205. Thus, Plaintiffs do not have a right to travel without any impediments \n\nwhatsoever. Indeed, Plaintiffs do not allege that they have suffered impediments \ndifferent than the general traveling public. \nPlaintiffs also argue that their status has been altered because they have been \npublicly associated with the No-Fly List in full view of co-workers and the general \ntraveling public. See Compl., docket no. 1, ¶¶ 23, 41, 54, 60, 62, 72, 81, 86, 89, 90, \n94. However, \"injury to reputation alone is insufficient to establish a deprivation of a \nliberty interest protected by the Constitution.\" Ulrich, 308 F.3d at 982. Plaintiffs have \nnot alleged any tangible harm to their personal or professional lives that is \nattributable to their association with the No-Fly List, and which would rise to the level \nof a Constitutional deprivation of a liberty right. Furthermore, Plaintiffs have not \nalleged any injury to a property interest as a result of the disclosure of allegedly \nstigmatizing statements. Plaintiffs have not plead any tangible harm that satisfies the \n\"plus\" prong. Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed to state a stigma-plus Fifth Amendment \nclaim. \nV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated in this Order, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction is GRANTED, except for the Fifth Amendment Due Process claim as it \nrelates to the clearance procedures established by the TSA. However, Plaintiffs have \nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted as to that claim. As a result, \nPlaintiffs' Complaint must be dismissed, without prejudice, for the reasons set forth in \nthis Order. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n[1] Although Plaintiffs' Complaint is broadly worded, Plaintiffs do not challenge the government's right to \ncreate or maintain either a No-Fly List or a Selectee List. Plaintiffs' counsel, at oral argument, stated the \nlawsuit does not in any way challenge the government's right to issue a Security Directive that says certain \npeople should be on a No-Fly List, and in fact counsel said \"we applaud that.\" Transcript, docket no. 29, \n32:21-33:2. \n[2] 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a) was previously codified at 49 U.S.C. § 1486(a). \n[3] At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs conceded that the Security Directives would be an order \"until \nsuch time comes about where we may have the opportunity to find out more about them specifically.\" \nTranscript, docket no. 29, 27:20-23. \n[4] At oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel conceded that to the extent the challenges are inescapably \nintertwined with the review of procedure and merits of the Security Directives, this Court would not have \njurisdiction. Transcript, docket no. 29, 31:19. \n[5] Defendants argue on the merits that \"the procedural protections afforded by the Government fully \nconform with due process requirements.\" Reply Br., docket no. 22, p. 12. The Government notes that all \n\nPlaintiffs have been offered an opportunity to establish they are not on the No-Fly List and do not pose a \nthreat to civil aviation, through the procedures established. The Court will not consider the merits of the \nDefendants' arguments in connection with a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a \nclaim. Jacobson v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 105 F.3d 1288, 1292 (9th Cir.1997). Defendants' arguments on the \nmerits can only be evaluated at summary judgment or trial. \n\t\r  ",

For several years prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 20011 the federal \n15  govcrrunent issuoo directives identifying persons who were decmed to pc..)se a threat to civil \n16  aviation.  Wheo the Transportation Security Administration was created in 2001, it assumed \n17  responsibility for compiling and administering thesc directives.  Today, Defendant~ the DI-lS, \ntM  Tom Ridge, the TSA, and David M. Stone adrnini~ter and maintain systems of records \n19  c()mprising at least two watch lists ofindiv-iduals perceived to he threats to aviation security: \n20  (1) a \"no-Ily\" list and (2) a \\\\se1ectec\" list.  On intim11ation and beliet~ these lists contain \n21  hundreds ifnot thousands of names.  The ''no-fly''liljt contains names ofpt':nplc whom air \nor \n22  carriers are prohihited from transporting.  TIlC \"selectee\" list contains names  passengers who \n23  mU11t go through additional security screening prior to boarding. This Complaint Uij~ the term \n24  \"NO-Fly List\" to refer to both the \"no-t1y'~ list and the \"seleo;..iee\" list. \n25  IR.  The No-Fly Li8t has been the subject of -intense media scrutiny.

Despite this request and a \n4  sub~equent lawsuit filed under FOIA, as well as thc intense public interest in the No-Fly List, \nS  Defendants refuse to disclose important information regarding the No-Fly List, although \n6  Defendants did disclose some inlhrmation. The infonnation Defendants disclosed fails to \n7  answer basic questio11s such as the criteria fOT placing names on or removi[lg names from the No \nS  Fly List, procedures lor amending jnformation on the NO-Fly List, or rules for maintaining or \n9  managing the No~Fly List.  Derendants continue to implement the No-Fly List to stop, \n'10  interrogate dctain, and search ilmocent passengers. \nj \n11  19.  Bccause Detendants have refused to provide any information regarding the \n12  creation, maintenance, and implementation of the NO-Fly List, Dcfendants muld be using race, \n13  teligion, ethnicity, national origin, or the exercise of First Almmdmcnt protected rights as iaetors \n14  in the No-Fly List. \n15  20.

Upon further infonnation and be1ict~ \n4  Defendants instruct recipients of the No-Fly I.ist to detain and interrogate any individual who \n5  checks in IllT OT deplanes from a flight whose name is similar or identical to a name dud appears \n6  on the No-Fly List.  Dettmdants do not make reasonable efforts to ensure sufficient accllf8cy, \n7  relevance, timeliness, or completeness to guarantee fairness to innocent passengers. who arc \n8  flaggoo by the No-Ply List. \n9  22.  On infonnation and beliet~ Defendants require airlines to install computer \n10  programs to match the names of passengers to the No-Fly List.  When a passenger with  name \nIi \n'II  similar or identical to a name on the No-Fly List attempts to eheck in, the airline's c(1mputcr \n12  prevents further processing of the passenger's boarding pass.  The computer program alerts \n13  airline personnel to contact ~ecllrity and/or law enforcement agents. \n14  23.  Innocent passenger~ at this point arc sometimes illti..1rmoo, in full view of other \n15  passengers waiting in line, that their names arc on a federal security list.  This results in \n16  signiticftl\"lt embarrassment and hwniliati(1n to the passenger, as fellow passengers and the \n17  traveling public subsequently regard the innocent passenger with suspicion or teaT.  In many \n18  instances, al\"l aiTlil\"le agent takes the passenger's identilication documents to a back room.  The \n19  passcnger is not free to leave, a.~ the agent has his or her driver's liCe-molC or passpOlt.  After a \n20  delay of up h) thrty~ftve minutes, the airline agent refums:. \n21  24.  In other instances airlit\"le agents summon law entoTCtlment or secmity peIl'onnel \nl \n22  to question the innocent passenger.  The passenger typically is not free to leave and is prevented \n23  Ih)m proceeding on his or her flight until the interrogation is completed.  Often, this \n24  interrogation occurs within full view of other passengers.  On some ou.::asions, unlfonncd \n25  security personnel or law enforcement threaten the innocent passenger with arrest a.nd/or e~clJtt \n26  thc passenger through the !lirport to a separate interrogation area, causing signilkant \n27  emharrassment and humiliation to the passenger. \nCOMPLAINT-CLASS ACnON -6  AMERICAN CIVIL I.IBERTIES UNiON \nOF WASHINGTON \n70S SECOND AVF.N!

The interrogation of ilU10cent passengers who arc stopped as a result ofllie No-\n2  Fly List has taken up to three hours.  During these interrogations, the innocent passenger's body \n3  and luggage aTC usually s~<lrchcd. Officers thoroughly review all of the documents in the \n4  passenger's possession, sometimes making copit$ ofthcm, and hand-search the passenger's \n5  luggage.  Unifonned officers question the innocent passenger about residel.1<;t;':; travel plans, \n6  occupation, and other pcrsoll!ll inthnnatioll.  The otl'tcers frequently employ a hostile and \n7  nc.:cLlsatory tone and treat the passenger as a suspected terrorist. \n8  Eventually, when the innocent passenger succeeds in persuading the airline aget\\t \n9  and/or security personnel and/or law enforcement of his or her identity, a boarding pass is issued. \n'10  These boarding passes, however, usually are ~tamped with a mark to indicate that the passenger \n11  must be subjected to enhanced s(\"-recning procedures, also referred tn as \"secondaTY screening.\" \n12  When an innocent No-Fly List passenger approaches the security line l('1r ordinary passengers, he \n13  or she is directed to a separate line t(n rut enhanced seaTch.  This search includes a body search, \n14  usually involving a wand and/or physical pat-down, and a htmd-search of allllfthe items in the \n15  passenger's luggage.  This scarch is signifi.cantly more intrusive Ihan the searches to which other \n16  individuals are subject  These innocent passengers are not seledcd foI' these enhanced searches \n17  randun\"lly.  Rather, they are selected because they arc flagged in connection with the No-Fly List. \n1M  27.  ltlllocent passengers subjected to this trcatment are stigmatizcd and subject to \n19  interrogations, ddays, enhanced searches, detentions, and/or other travel impediments when they \n20  fly.

Some are told that they were \n9  selected for this treatment randomly, even when they are selected. virtually every time they fly. \n10  30.  For innocent passengers who are told that they have been identified in connection \nII  with the No-Fly List, Defendants have not instituted. u unifonn policy thr informing them of \n12  procedufes available to contcs.t their placement on the No-Fly List.  The TSA docs not publici:£c \n13  its ombudsman process at airports or elsewhere.  As a. result, some innocent passengers wl:U) \n14  inquire a'> to why they were placed on the No-Fly List are told that there is no avallable recourse \n15  and that they will IXmtinuc to be flagged every time they fly.

Tn olher cases, the TSA processes the PIYF and then issues a letter that the \n9  pU8~erlgcr can show to airline personnel in an effort to persuade them that he or !She has been \n10  cleared by the TSA.  Typically, 1he letter sent to the passenger contains the following \n11  quali fication:  \"While TSA cannot ensure that your travel will be delay free. these procedures \n12  should streamline Y(.lUr check-in process.
