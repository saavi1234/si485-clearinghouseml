    "summary": "<p>For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">special collection</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On January 17, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence authorized the declassification and public release of numerous orders approving the National Security Agency's (\"NSA\") so-called \"Bulk Telephony Metadata Program\" under Section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (\"FISA\"), commonly referred to as Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. Press release available <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210320220434/https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2014/item/1002-statement-from-dni-james-r-clapper-on-intelligence-reforms-announced-today-by-president-obama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Under the program, the NSA has collected records from large telecommunication companies about, apparently, virtually all domestic telephone calls. These records, termed \"telephony metadata,\" include the phone numbers placed and received; the date, time and duration of calls; some location identifiers; and calling card numbers. The records, however, apparently do not include the parties' names, addresses or financial information or the call's content. Once collected, the records are stored for several years and may be queried, used, and disseminated only in accordance with \"minimization rules\" proposed by the government and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\"). The most basic aspect of the minimization rules has been that the metadata records can be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulated facts, that the identifier that will be used as the basis for the query is associated with specified foreign terrorist organizations.</p>\r\n<p>The program began under executive authority alone, following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Subsequently, in 2006, the federal government first sought approval of the program from the FISC under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. This Section 215 order must be reviewed and reapproved by the FISC essentially every 90 days. It has been approved dozens of times by many different federal judges, on the FISC, since its initial approval on May 24, 2006 by the FISC. (See <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13069\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BR 06-05).</a></p>\r\n<p>This matter is a continuation of the Section 215 program from June 19, 2014, to September 12, 2014. On June 19, 2014, FISC Judge James B. Zagel issued the primary order authorizing the collection under specified procedures. The previous order was <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BR 14-67.</a>&nbsp;As usual, this order includes \"minimization\" procedures that impose a variety of limits on the NSA's use of the telephony metadata. The minimization procedures enumerated in this order are the same as those in the previous order.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Zagel wrote in his order that his approval of this application meant that he agreed with previous decisions of the FISC in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BR 13-158</a>, which held that under the controlling precedent of Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), the production of call detail records in this matter did not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. With respect to the statutory requirements for the issuance of orders for the collection of bulk telephony metadata, Judge Zagel adopted the analysis put forth by Judge Claire Eagan in her August 29 Opinion in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211201012824/https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BR 13-109</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On June 26, 2014, FISC Judge Thomas F. Hogan ordered the publication of the June 19 Memorandum Opinion and Primary Order after the government reviewed and redacted the document.</p>\r\n<p>The next FISC order dealing with the 215 bulk telephony metadata program is <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BR 14-125.</a></p>",

      "text": "TOP SECRETl/Sl/fNOFORN \nUNITED STA TES \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT \nWASHINGTON, D. C. \nIN RE APPUCATION OF THE FEDERAL \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION FOR AN \nORDER REQUIRING TIIE PRODUCTION \nOF TANGIBLE TIIlNGS FRO \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThe Court has today issued the Primary Order appended hereto granting the \n\"Application of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for an Order Requiring the \nTOP SECRET#SJ//NOFORN \n\nTOP SECRETlfSJ//NOFORN \nProduction of Tangible Things\" ('1 Application\" or \"~e instant Application\"), which was \nsubmitted to the Court on June 19, 2014, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"). \nThe Application requested the issuance of orders pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §1861, as \namended (also known as Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act), requiring the ongoing \ndaily production to the National Security Agency (\"NSA\") of certain telephone call \ndetail records in bulk (''bulk telephony metadata\"). \nOn August 29, 2013, Judge Claire V. Eagan of this Court issued an Amended \nMemorandum Opinion in Docket Number BR 13-109, offering sound reasons for \nauthorizing an application for orders requiring the production of bulk telephony \nmetadata (\"August 29 Opinion\"). On September 17, 2013, following a declassification \nreview by the Executive Bran~ the Court published its redacted August 29 Opinion \nand the Primary Order issued in Docket Number BR 13-109. On October 11, 2013, \nJudge Mary A. McLaughlin of this Court granted the FBI' s application to renew the \nauthorities approved in Docket Number BR 13-109, issued a Memorandum adopting \nJudge Eagan's  statutory and constitutional analyses, and provided additional analysis \non whether the production of bulk telephony metadata violates the Fourth Amendment \n(\"October 11_O pinion\"). Both judges of this Court held_t hat the compelled production \nof such records does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. Judge \nTOP SECRET/JSJl/NOFORN \n2 \n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \nMcLaughlin further found that the Supreme Court's decision in United v. Jones,_ U.S. \n132 S. Ct. 945 (2012) neither mandates nor supports a different conclusion. \n_J \nFollowing a declassification review by the Executive Branch, the Court published the \nOctober 11 Opinion and the Primary Order issued in Docket Number BR 13-158 in \nredacted form a week later on October 18, 2013.  Since the date of Judge McLaughlin's \nre-authorization of the bulk telephony metadata collection in Docket Number BR 13-\n158, the government has sought on three occasions renewed authority for this \ncollection. The Court has approved those applications in Docket Numbers BR 14-01 (on \nJanuary 3, 2014), BR 14-67 (on March 28, 2014), and the instant Application. \nIn approving the instant Application, I fully agree with and adopt the \nconstitutional and statutory analyses contained in the August 29 Opinion and the \nOctober 11 Memorandum. In particular, with respect to the constitutional analysis, I \nconcur with Judges Eagan and McLaughlin that under the controlling precedent of \nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), the production of call detail records in this matter \ndoes not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. With respect to the \nstatutory requirements for the issuance of orders for the collection of bulk telephony \nmetadata, I adopt the analysis put forth by Judge Eagan in her August 29 Opinion, and \nin particular, I note her discussion on the issue of relevance: \nTOP SECRET//Sl//NOFORN \n3 \n\nTOP SBCRET!/Sil/NOFORN \nThe government must demonstrate \"facts showing that there are reasonable \ngrounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation.\"  50 U.S.C. 1861(b)(2)(A).  The fact that international terrorist \noperatives are using telephone communications, and that it is necessary to obtain \nthe bulk collection of a telephone company's metadata to determine those \nconnections between known and unknown international terrorist operatives as \npart of authorized investigations, is sufficient to meet the low statutory hurdle \nset out in Section 215 to obtain a production of records.  Furthermore, it is \nimportant to remember that the relevance finding is only one part of a whole \nprotective statutory scheme.  Within the whole of this particular statutory \nscheme, the low relevance standard is counter-balanced by significant post-\nproduction  minimization  procedures  that  must  accompany  such  an \nauthorization and an available mechanism for an adversarial challenge in this \nCourt by the record holder. [. ..]  Without the minimization procedures set out \nin detail in this Court's Primary Order, for example, no Orders for production \nwould issue from this Court.  ~Primary Ord. at 4-17.  Taken together, the \nSection 215 provisions are designed to permit the government wide latitude to \nseek the information it needs to meet its national security responsibilities, but \nonly in combination with specific procedures for the protection of U.S. person \ninformation that are tailored to the production and with an opportunity for the \nauthorization  to  be challenged.  The  Application  before  this  Court fits \ncomfortably within this statutory framework. \nAugust 29 Opinion at 22-23. \nSince the issuance of the August 29 Opinion and October 11 Memorandum, there \nhave been changes to the minimization procedures .applied to the bulk telephony \nmetadata collection. These were requested by the government and approved by this \nCourt. Moreover, the legality of the bulk telephony metadata collection has been \nchallenged in litigation throughout the country and considered by four U.S. District \nTOP SBCRBT//Sl//NOFORN \n4 \n\nTOP Sli:CRETNSl//NOFORN \nCourt judges. Lastly, on December 18, 2013, in an order entered in BR 13-158, Judge \nMcLaughlin granted leave to the Center for National Security Studies (\"the Center\") to \nfile an amicus curiae brief on why 50 U.S.C. §1861 does not authorize the collection of \ntelephony metadata records in bulk. The Center filed its amicus brief on April 3, 2014, \nafter the most recent authorization of this collection in Docket Number BR 14-67. Prior \nto making a decision to grant the instant Application, I considered each of these \ndevelopments, which I briefly note below. \nChanges to Minimization Procedures \nPursuant to 50 U.S.C. §1861(g), the bulk telephony metadata collected pW-suant \nto orders granting the instant Applicatiol\\ as well as all predecessor applications, are \nsubject to minimizations procedures. The statutory requirements for minimization \nprocedures under 50 U.S.C. §1861(g) are discussed in the August 29 Opinion. August \n29 Opinion at 11. On February 5, 2014, the Court granted the government's Motion for \nAmendment to Primary Order in Docket Number BR 14-01, which amended the \nminimization procedures required by the Primary Order in that case in two significant \nrespects. First, the amended procedures preclude the government (except in emergency \ncircumstances) from querying the bulk telephony metadata without first having \nTOP 5ECKET1/SJ1/NOPORN \n5 \n\nTOP SECRET//Sl//NOFORN \nobtained, by motion, a determination from this Court that reasonable, articulable \nsuspicion (RAS) exists to believe that the selection term (e.g., a telephone number) to be \nused for querying is associated with an international terrorist organization named in the \nPrimary Order requiring the production of the bulk telephony metadata.1  Second, the \namended procedures require that queries of the bulk telephony metadata be limited so \nas to identify only that metadata found within two \"hops\" of an approved selection \ntenn.2  The government has requested, and the Court has approved, the same \nlimitations in orders accompanying the two subsequent applications for this collection \nfiled with this Court (i.e., Docket Number BR 14-67 and the instant Application). \nOn February 25, 2014, the government filed a Motion for Second Amendment to \nPrimary Order in Docket Number BR 14-01, through which it sought further to modify \nthe minimization procedures (\"February 25 Motion\"). Specifically, the government \nsought relief from the requirement that it destroy bulk telephony metadata after five \n1 Previously, the minimization procedures allowed for this RAS determination to be made by one \nof a limited set of high-ranking NSA personnel. \n2 The first uhop\" would include metadata associated with the set of numbers directly in contact \nwith the approved selection term, and the second \"hop\" would include meta data associated with the set \nof numbers directly in contact with the first \"'hop\" numbers. Previously, the minimization procedures \nallowed the government to query the bulk telephony metadata to identify metadata within three ''hops\" \nof an approved selection term. \nTOP SECRET//Sl//NOFORN \n6 \n\nTOP SECRETl/Sl//NOFORN \nyears, based on the government's common law preservation obligations in pending civil \nlitigation.  In seeking relief from the five-year destruction requirement, the government \nproposed a number of additional restrictions on access to and use of the data, all \ndesigned to ensure that collected metadata that was more than five years old could only \nbe used for the relevant civil litigation purposes. Although this Court initially denied \nthe February 25 Motion without prejudice, the Court granted a second motion for the \nsame relief on March 12, 2014 (\"March 12 Order and Opinion\"), that the government \nsought in order to comply with a preservation order that had been issued by the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California after this Court's denial of the \nFebruary 25 Motion. The March 12 Order and Opinion required that the bulk telephony \nmetadata otherwise required to be destroyed under the five year limitation on retention \nbe preserved and/or stored \"[p]ending resolution of the preservation issues raised ... \nbefore the United States District Court for the Northern District of California[.\"] March \n12 Opinion and Order at 6.  The March 12 Order and Opinion prohibited NSA \nintelligence analysts from accessing or using such data for any purpose; permitted NSA \npersonnel to access the data only for the purpose of ensuring continued compliance \nwith the government's preservation obligations; and prohibited any further accesses of \nBR metadata for civil litigation purposes without prior written notice to this Court.

Finally, the March 12 Opinion and Order required the government promptly to \nnotify this Court of any additional material developments in civil litigation pertaining to \nthe BR metadata, including the resolution of the preservation issues in the proceedings \nin the Northern District of California. Id. at 7. The preservation issues raised in the \nNorthern District of California have not yet been resolved. As a result, the government \nhas requested and the Court has approved the same exemption from the five year \nlimitation on retentio~ subject to the same restrictions on access and use, in Docket \nNumber BR 14-67 and the instant Application.  \n. ·. .. \nPrior to deciding whether to re-authorize the bulk telephony metadata collection \nthrough the appended Primary Order, I considered with care the stated changes to the \nminimization procedtires. As described, the first set of changes approved in the \nFebruary 5 Order provide enhanced protections for the bulk telephony metada~. \nWhile the March 12 Opinion and Order allows the government to retain bulk telephony \nmetadata beyond five years, it allows the government to do so for the sole purpose of \nmeeting preservation obligations in civil litigation pending against it. \nTOP SECRETHSI/INOFORN \n8 \n\nTOP SECRET//SU/NOFORN \nU.S. District Court Cases \nIn recent months, the legality of the bulk telephony metadata collection has been \nchallenged on both statutory and constitutional grounds in proceedings throughout the \ncountry, and four U.S. District Court judges have issued opinions on these challenges. \nSmith v. Obama, No. 2:13-CV-257-BLW, 2014 WL 2506421 (D. Idaho June 3, 2014); \nA.C.L.U. v. Clapper, 959 F. Supp. 2d 724 (S.D.N.Y. 2013); Klayman v. Obama, 957 F. Supp. \n2d 1 (D.D.C. 2013); and U.S. v. Moalin, No. 10cr4246 JM, 2013 WL 6079518 (S.D. Cal. \nNovember 18, 2013).  In three of the four cases in which judges have issued opinions \n(i.e., all but the Klayman case), they have rejected plaintiffs' challenges to this collection. \nIn particular, with respect to Fourth Amendment challenges raised by plaintiffs, the \njudges in Smith, Clapper and Moalin recognized that the Supreme Court's decision in \nSmith v. Maryland is controlling and does not support a finding that the bulk telephony \nmetadata collection is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. \nIn Kl.ayman, Judge Richard J. Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia alone held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the \nbulk telephony metadata collection was an unreasonable search under the Fourth \nAmendment. Klayman, 957 F. Supp. 2d at 41.  Judge Leon ordered the government to \nTOPSECRET//SY/NOFORN \n9 \n\nTOP 5ECRET/fSI//NOFORN \ncease collection of any telephony metadata associated with [the plaintiffs'] personal \nVerizon accounts\" and destroy any such metadata in its possession, but he stayed the \norder pending appeal. Id. at 43. \nOn January 22, 2014, a recipient of a production order in Docket Number BR 14-\n01 filed a Petition (\"January 22 Petition\") pursuant to 50U.S.C.§1861(£)(2)(A} and Rule \n33 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") Rules of Procedure, asking \nthis Court \"to vacate, modify, or reaffirm\" the production order issued to it.3  According \nto the Petitioner, the Petition arose \"entirely from the effect on [the recipient] of Judge \nLeon's Memorandum [Opinion],\" and specifically, that Judge's conclusion that the \nSupreme Court's decision in Smith v. Maryland is \"inapplicable to the specific activities \nmandated by the [Section} 1861 order at issue in the Klayman litigation.\" January 22 \nPetition at 3-4. Pursuant to the requirements of 50 U.S.C. § 1861(£), Judge Rosemary M. \nCollyer of this Court issued an Opinion and Order on March 20, 2014 (\"March 20 \nOpinion and Order\"), finding that the Petition provided no basis for vacating or \n3 Following a declassification review by the Executive Branch, the Court published the January 22 \nPetition filed in Docket Nwnber BR 14-01 in redacted form on April 25, 2014. \nTOP SECRET//51//NOFORN \n10 \n\nTOP SJ!CltETllSitfNO:FORN \nmodifying the relevant production order issued in Docket Number BR 14-01.4 In her \nMarch 20 Opinion and Order, Judge Collyer engaged in an extensive analysis of Judge \nLeon's opinion in Klayman, ultimately disagreeing with his conclusion that Smith v. \nMaryland is inapplicable to the collection of bulk telephony metadata. \nIn issuing the Primary Order appen~ed hereto which re-authorizes the bulk \ntelephony metadata collection, I have carefully examined the noted U.S. District Court \nopinions, and I agree with Judge Collyer's analysis and opinion of the Klayman holding. \nAmicus Curiae Brief \nOn April 3, 2014, the Center for National Security Studies filed an amicus curiae \nbrief explaining why it believes that 50 U.S.C. §1861 does not authorize the collection of \nbulk telephony metadata. The amicus brief made a number of thoughtful points, the \nmerits of which I have analyzed. Notwithstanding the Center's arguments, I find the \nauthority requested by the FBI through the instant Application meets the requirements \nof the statute, and that the collection of bulk telephony metadata may be authorized \nunder the terms of the statute. \n4  Following a declassification review by the Executive Branch, the Court published the March 20 \nOpinion and Order issued in Docket Number BR 14-01 in redacted form on April 25, 2014 . \n. TOP SECRET/ISI//NOFORN \n11 \n\nTOP SECRET//-61//NOFORN \nConclusion \nThe unauthorized disclosure of the bulk telephony metadata collection more \nthan a year ago led to many written and oral expressions of opinions about the legality \nof collecting telephony metadata. Congress is well aware that this Court has \ninterpreted the provisions of 50 U.S.C. § 1861 to permit this particular collection, and \ndiverse views about the collection have been expressed by individual members of \nCongress. In recent months, Congress has contemplated a number of changes to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a few of which would specifically prohibit this \ncollection.  Congress could enact statutory changes that would prohibit this collection \ngoing forward, but under the existing statutory framework, I find that the requested \nauthority for the collection of bulk telephony metadata should be granted. Courts must \nfollow the law as it stands until the Congress or the Supreme Court changes it. \nIn light of the public interest in this particular collection and the government's \ndeclassification of related materials, including substantial portions of Judge Eagan's \nAugust 29 Opinion, Judge McLaughlin's October 11 Memorandum, and Judge Collyer's \nMarch 20 Opinion and Order, I request pursuant to FISC Rule 62 that this \nMemorandum Opinion and Accompanying Primary Order also be published, and I \nTOP SECRETl/51//NOFORN \n12 \n\nTOP SECRETf/Sl://NOFORN \ndirect such request to the Presiding Judge as required by the Rule. \nJo\\ \nENTERED this/f day of June, 2014. \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n13 \n\nTOP SECRET//511/NOFORN \nUNITED STATES \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT \nWASHINGTON, D.

There are reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things sought are \nrelevant to authorized investigations (other than threat assessments) being conducted \nby the FBI under guidelines approved by the Attorney General under Executive Order \n12333 to protect against international terrorism, which investigations are not being \nconducted solely upon the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. [50 U.S.C. § 1861(c)(l)] \n2.  The tangible things sought could be obtained with a subpoena duces tecum \nissued by a court of the United States in aid of a grand jury investigation or with any \nother order issued by a court of the United States directing the production of records or \n1 The Honorable Rosemary M. Collyer issued an Opinion and Order finding that, under Smith v. \nMaryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), this bulk production of non-content call detail records does not \ninvolve a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment. See FISC docket no. BR 14-01, \nOpinion and Order issued on March 20, 2014 (under seal and pending consideration for \nunsealing, declassification, and release). Tilis authorization relies on that analysis of the Fourth \nAmendment issue. In addition, the Court has carefully considered opinions issued by Judges \nEagan and McLaughlin in docket numbers BR 13-109 and BR 13-158, respectively, as well as the \ndecision in Smith v.
