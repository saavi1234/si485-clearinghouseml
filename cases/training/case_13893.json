    "summary": "<p>On December 13, 2013, Wheaton College, a Christian school, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The college sued the Department of Health and Human Services under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.). The college, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the Final Mandate of the Affordable Care Act, which requires the college to offer health insurance plans that provide free coverage of contraceptives that the college views as abortifacients, violates the RFRA; the APA; the Free Exercise, Free Speech, and Establishment Clauses of the 1st Amendment; and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 5th Amendment. The college had previously filed this suit in the District of the District of Columbia, where it was dismissed as moot by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on August 13, 2013 <a href=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12681>Wheaton College v. Sebelius</a>.</p><p>Specifically, Wheaton claimed that its identity as a Christian liberal arts college forbids it from providing access to abortion, including what it views as abortifacient drugs or devices. The college claimed that these religious beliefs preclude it from participating in the ACA's regulatory scheme to provide and subsidize these drugs and devices. Nor can the college participate in the accommodation offered by the government, which would still require it to designate an agent to pay for the objected-to services on Wheaton's behalf, as well as to take steps to trigger the coverage; the accommodation itself violates the school's religious beliefs, Wheaton argued.</p><p>The Final Mandate was set to go into effect on July 1, 2014. </p><p>On June 23, 2014, the district court (Judge Robert M. Dow, Jr.) denied Wheaton's motion for a preliminary injunction of the Final Mandate. 50 F.Supp.3d 939.  The court held that Wheaton had no likelihood of success in establishing a substantial burden on its religious exercise, given the accommodation that the government offered it.</p><p>On June 30, 2014, the day before the regulations took effect, Wheaton filed an emergency motion for reconsideration, which the court denied based in part on the <i> Hobby Lobby </i> decision handed down by the Supreme Court that same day. Nothing in that decision, the court said, overruled controlling 7th Circuit precedent regarding the sufficiency of the government's accommodation. 2014 WL 3034010. </p><p>That same day, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit (Judge Richard Posner) also denied Wheaton's emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, stating that <i> Hobby Lobby </i> emphasized that the accommodation provision \"constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government's aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.\" 791 F.3d 792.</p><p>However, the Supreme Court granted a temporary injunction on June 30, 2014, over the dissents of Justices Breyer and Sotomayor. 573 U.S. 943. On July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court ordered that the injunction remain, pending appeal, so long as Wheaton informed the Secretary of HHS of its religious objections in writing. In other words, the college did not have to follow the accommodation's procedures. Justices Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Kagan dissented. 573 U.S. 958. </p><p>On July 1, 2015, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court’s denial of Wheaton’s request for a preliminary injunction. On December 2, 2015, the District Court issued a minute entry granting the parties’ joint motion to stay the case until the ruling in <a href=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13143>Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell</a>, consolidated as <a href=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12038>Zubik v. Burwell</a>, so that the parties could evaluate the case following that ruling. On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam order remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals, ordering the lower courts to give the parties time to come to agreement on an approach that \"accommodates petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans 'receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.'\" 136 S.Ct 1557. The Court took no position on the merits of this case. </p><p>This case them resumed activity as the parties entered into settlement discussions, which continued through 2017. On January 18, 2018, following the election of Donald Trump and a drastic shift in administration, Wheaton moved for permanent injunction, stating that because the government had \"now admitted that this mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”),\"and that the court should issue an injunction and end the litigation. The court granted the motion and issued a permanent injunction on February 22, 2018. </p><p>On September 7, 2018, Wheaton filed a motion for attorney's fees in which they requested $1,178,135.30. On December 20, 2018, Wheaton withdrew its motion without explanation. There has been no substantive docket activity since and the case is presumed closed. </p>",

Wheaton College is a liberal arts \ncollege in Illinois that although not owned by or affiliated \nwith any church (in other words, it is nondenominational) is \ndeeply  committed  to  evangelical  Protestantism.  Although \nWheaton hires faculty and staff from a variety of Christian \ntraditions, and admits students of varied faiths, it requires \nall members of the college community, which is to say all \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 2 of 18 PageID #:26656\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\n2  No. 14-2396 \nemployees and all students, to sign a “Community Cove-\nnant” that among other things requires them to “uphold the \nGod-given  worth  of  human  beings,  from  conception  to \ndeath.” (Despite the centrality of the covenant to the col-\nlege’s argument, its lawyers did not bother to include it in \nthe appellate record. We found it online, at Wheaton Col-\nlege,  “Community  Covenant,”  www.wheaton.edu/about-\nwheaton/community-covenant  (visited  June  17,  2015,  as \nwere the other websites cited in this opinion).) The Covenant \ndoes not mention contraception, but the passage we quoted \nimplies, and Wheaton believes, that what is called “emer-\ngency contraception,” which means contraception after in-\ntercourse, is forbidden on religious grounds if it can destroy \na fertilized ovum. Wheaton also opposes intrauterine devic-\nes (IUDs) that whether inserted before or after intercourse \nmay prevent the implantation of a fertilized ovum. The col-\nlege  implements  its  belief  about  emergency  contraception \nand IUDs  by excluding coverage of them from its health \nplans. \nContraception that prevents fertilization rather than de-\nstroying a fertilized ovum is referred to by the college as \n“traditional contraception,” and the college has made clear \nthat it does not oppose such contraception. Of the 20 types of \nfemale contraceptive approved by the Food and Drug Ad-\nministration  the  college  disapproves  only  emergency-\ncontraceptive drugs and certain IUDs. \nThe college brought this suit against the federal govern-\nment complaining that the Affordable Care Act is infringing \nits religious rights—in violation of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1, as well as the First \nAmendment—by  making  it  complicit  in  the  provision  of \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 3 of 18 PageID #:26657\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\nNo. 14-2396  3 \nemergency-contraceptive coverage to its employees and stu-\ndents. The suit is pending in the district court; before us is \nthe college’s appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunc-\ntion. \nThe  Introduction  to  the  college’s  opening  brief  begins \nwith the following inaccurate statement: “This case arises \nfrom  the  government’s  effort  to  use  Wheaton  College’s \nhealth plans to distribute emergency contraceptive drugs.” \nAnd the first sentence of the reply brief states in like vein \nthat “Wheaton has benefit plans, and the government wants \nto use them.” At oral argument the college’s lawyer insisted \nthat  the  government  was  “using  our  plan”  and  “putting \n[additional terms] into our contract.” If Wheaton College is \nwrong, and the government is not trying to “use” the col-\nlege’s health plans to provide insurance coverage for emer-\ngency contraceptives (of which the best known are “morning \nafter” pills), or to add terms to those plans, the college has \nno case. This point is underscored by the fact that the only \narticulated relief it seeks in this court is a “remand with an \ninjunction [we assume the college means a preliminary in-\njunction]  prohibiting  the  government’s  efforts  to  use \nWheaton’s plans.” True, it says it also wants “an injunction \nagainst the government during the pendency of this appeal \nrequiring it to treat Wheaton as an exempt ‘religious em-\nployer’” (it means an injunction requiring such treatment, \nnot an injunction against the government’s requiring such \ntreatment); but at the oral argument the college’s lawyer in-\ndicated that the college’s only objection is to the govern-\nment’s “using” Wheaton’s health plans to get around the \ncollege’s  objection  to  emergency  contraception.  Actually \nthere  are  no  efforts  by  the  government  to  take  over \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 4 of 18 PageID #:26658\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\n4  No. 14-2396 \nWheaton’s health plans, as Wheaton contends. Acts cannot \nbe enjoined that are neither actuality nor threat. \nThe contraception provisions of the federal Act and its \nimplementing regulations do not alter or annex college or \nother institutional health plans that fail to provide coverage \nfor some or all contraceptives. In the case of religious objec-\ntors to such coverage, the Act requires providers of health \ninsurance (to the objectors’ staff, students, etc., and third-\nparty administrators, which usually are also insurance com-\npanies) to cover certain preventive services without cost to \nthe insured. The services include “all Food and Drug Ad-\nministration  approved  contraceptive  methods.”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4);  45  C.F.R.  § 147.130(a)(1)(iv);  Health  Re-\nsources  &  Services  Administration,  “Women’s  Preventive \nServices  Guidelines,”  www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines. \nThe college does not challenge the government’s authority to \nrequire that all approved methods of contraception be avail-\nable to women at no cost to them. What it challenges is the \nrequirement that it notify its insurers or the government that \nit is claiming a religious exemption and that it give the gov-\nernment the insurers’ names so that the government can di-\nrect the insurers to provide emergency-contraception cover-\nage. \nWe  should  note  that  in  its  May  2014  response  to  the \n“Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material Facts,” the gov-\nernment emphatically denied that it has approved any abor-\ntifacient contraceptive; it said that “no FDA-approved con-\ntraceptive methods cause the demise of an early embryo as \npart of their mechanism of action.” True, the government \ndefines abortion as the termination of a pregnancy, and de-\nfines pregnancy as (beginning) the moment an embryo is \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 5 of 18 PageID #:26659\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\nNo. 14-2396  5 \nimplanted in the wall of the uterus (see 45 C.F.R. § 46.202(f)), \nwhereas Wheaton defines “conception,” which it regards as \nthe first stage in a pregnancy, as the creation of a fertilized \novum. It takes about five or six days for a fertilized ovum to \ntravel down a fallopian tube and begin the process of im-\nplantation  in  the  uterine  wall.  See  UCSF Medical  Center, \n“Conception:  How  it  Works,”  www.ucsfhealth.org/educa\ntion/conception_how_it_works/.  Wheaton  considers  any \ndrug that kills the fertilized ovum by preventing implanta-\ntion to be an abortifacient. \nThe FDA’s “Birth Control Guide” says in apparent con-\nformity with Wheaton College’s view that two emergency \ncontraceptives, Plan B and ella, may prevent implantation of \na fertilized egg. The government has not disputed (which is \nnot to say that it necessarily accepts) this view, but scientific \nstudies dispute it. According to The Emergency Contraception \nWebsite  (operated  by  the  Office  of  Population  Control  of \nPrinceton University and the Association of Reproductive \nHealth Professionals), “How Does Emergency Contraception \nPrevent Pregnancy?,” http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ecw\nork.html, “There is no evidence to suggest that either of the \nFDA-approved emergency contraceptive options, levonorg-\nestrel (LNG, such as Plan B One-Step, Take Action, Next Choice \nOne Dose or My Way) or ulipristal acetate (UPA, such as ella) \nworks after an egg is fertilized.” See also James Trussell, \nElizabeth G.

The government, while it denies that the emergency \ncontraceptives approved by the FDA and hence subject to \nthe  contraception-coverage  provisions  of  the  Affordable \nCare  Act  are  abortifacients,  has  not  made  an  issue  of \nWheaton’s religious sincerity.  Moreover, the scientific litera-\nture does not challenge the capacity of IUDs to prevent im-\nplantation, so Wheaton’s religious objection to those devices, \nat least, is not affected by scientific controversy. \nAs explained in too many cases to warrant citation, the \nAffordable Care Act requires college health insurance plans \n(including  plans  in  which  an  insurance  company  merely \nadministers a plan insured by the college itself and is there-\nfore a third-party administrator rather an insurer) to cover \nthe 20 types of FDA-approved contraceptives. But a college \ncan refuse to include in its health plans coverage of drugs of \nwhich it disapproves on sincere religious grounds. To exer-\ncise this right of refusal the college has only to notify its \nhealth insurers, or if it prefers the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, of its unwillingness to provide coverage. \nThe insurers are then obligated by the Affordable Care Act \nto provide the coverage directly to requesting students, fac-\nulty, and staff. The college and its health plans are thus by-\npassed. \nSo  when  Wheaton  College  tells  us  that  it  is  being \n“forced” to allow “use” of its health plans to cover emergen-\n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 7 of 18 PageID #:26661\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\nNo. 14-2396  7 \ncy contraceptives, it is wrong. It’s being “forced” only to no-\ntify  its  insurers  (including  third-party  administrators), \nwhether directly or by notifying the government (which will \nforward the notification to the insurers), that it will not use \nits health plans to cover emergency contraception, that it is \nout of the loop, that the insurers will have to deal directly \nwith the students, faculty, and staff, bypassing the college \nhealth plans, which remain in force, so far as contraceptive \ncoverage is concerned, only for the contraceptives that the \ncollege does not disapprove of on religious grounds. The col-\nlege doesn’t even have to inform the insurers of their obliga-\ntion to provide coverage; the government as we said does \nthat if the college has told the government that it refuses to \nprovide the coverage. \nOnce informed by the government of the college’s objec-\ntion, the insurers are required by the Affordable Care Act \nand implementing regulations to notify the members of the \ncollege community of their right to coverage by the insurers. \nIn deference to religious sensibilities the government directs \nthe insurers to separate notification to the community mem-\nbers from the insurers’ communications with them concern-\ning the college’s health plans, and to include a statement that \nthe college is not funding or administering contraceptive (in \nWheaton’s case just emergency-contraceptive) coverage. 29 \nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(d). Call this \n“using”  the  health  plans?  We  call  it  refusing  to  use  the \nhealth plans. \nThe upshot is that the college contracts with health insur-\ners  for  contraceptive  coverage  exclusive  of  coverage  for \nemergency  contraceptives,  and  the  Department  of  Health \nand Human Services contracts with those insurers to cover \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 8 of 18 PageID #:26662\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\n8  No. 14-2396 \nemergency-contraceptive  benefits.  The  latter  contracts  are \nnot part of the college’s health plans, and so the college is \nmistaken when it tells us that the government is “interfer-\ning” with the college’s contracts with its insurers. The con-\ntracts, which do not require coverage of emergency contra-\nception, are unchanged. New contracts are created, to which \nthe college is not a party, between the government and the \ninsurers. \nAfter the district court denied the preliminary injunction \nsought by Wheaton College and we denied a temporary in-\njunction pending appeal, the college sought relief from the \nSupreme Court. In a brief per curiam order the Court said \nthat if the college notified the Department of Health and \nHuman  Services  in  writing  of  its  religious  objection  to \nproviding coverage for certain types of contraceptives, the \nDepartment could rely on the notice “to facilitate the provi-\nsion of full contraceptive coverage under the Act”—in other \nwords, to notify the insurers that they would be obligated to \nprovide, to the members of the Wheaton College communi-\nty, “without cost, the full range of FDA approved contracep-\ntives.” Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014). The \nDepartment notifies the insurers of their obligation to pro-\nvide contraceptive coverage in the college’s stead without \ncost to, or any involvement of, the college. \nThe college argues that it remains involuntarily complicit \nin the provision of emergency contraception because its noti-\nfication to the Department that it objects to the provision of \ncontraception on religious grounds serves as the “trigger” of \nthe Department’s ordering the insurers to cover emergency \ncontraception. It says as the trigger-puller or facilitator the \ncollege shares responsibility for the extension of such cover-\n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 9 of 18 PageID #:26663\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\nNo. 14-2396  9 \nage to its students, faculty, and staff. That also is incorrect. \nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to provide cover-\nage for FDA-approved emergency as well as traditional con-\ntraception to Wheaton’s students and employees, and to pick \nup the tab for that coverage (which the government reim-\nburses)  should  Wheaton  decide  to  opt  out  of  paying  for \nemergency-contraception coverage on religious grounds. As \nwe explained in University of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d \n606, 614–15 (7th Cir. 2015), it is the law, not any action on the \npart of the college, that obligates insurers “to pick up the ball \nif [the college] decides, as is its right, to drop it. [The col-\nlege’s notification to the government] no more ‘triggers’ [the \ninsurer’s] obligation to provide contraceptive services than a \ntortfeasor’s  declaring  bankruptcy  ‘triggers’  his  co-\ntortfeasors’ joint and several liability for damages. [The in-\nsurer] must provide the services no matter what; [by notify-\ning the government, the college] simply shifts the financial \nburden from the university to the government, as desired by \nthe university.” Wheaton College does not want to be in-\nvolved in the provision of emergency contraceptives; pursu-\nant to its wishes, it no longer is involved. \nIt doesn’t claim any right to prevent its students or em-\nployees  (not  to  mention  dependents  of  those  employees, \nwho are also covered by Wheaton’s health plans) from ob-\ntaining access to emergency contraceptives covered by the \nAffordable Care Act. But it seeks to make that access diffi-\ncult. For supposing that the college has no obligation to noti-\nfy the government or the insurers that it doesn’t want to \ncover  emergency  contraception,  how  are  the  government \nand the insurers to find this out? Are they required to inves-\ntigate every college?

Would that \nsatisfy Wheaton? It hasn’t told us, but we suspect not, be-\ncause in Wheaton’s view its notice to the government would \nstill “trigger” the provision of emergency-contraception to \nits students and employees by its insurers, albeit not pursu-\nant to its contracts with them. Wheaton’s antipathy is to hav-\ning  any  contractual  relations  with  insurers  who  provide \nemergency contraception to members of the Wheaton Col-\nlege community. Because they are “its” insurers, someone \nnot in the know might think it “complicit” in the insurers’ \nprovision of a type of coverage that offends Wheaton’s reli-\ngious views. But where’s the complicity? \nEven with a strong case Wheaton could not obtain an in-\njunction against the insurers when it hasn’t named them as \ndefendants in its complaint. They now have a contract with \nthe government obliging them to insure the members of the \nWheaton community for emergency contraception. The con-\ntract provides them with generous reimbursement. See Uni-\nversity of Notre Dame v. Burwell, supra, 786 F.3d at 613.

In any event, termination of the contracts would give \nWheaton only temporary relief, since the government would \nnotify any new insurers hired by Wheaton of their legal ob-\nligation to provide emergency-contraceptive coverage. \nAt oral argument Wheaton’s lawyer said that his client \nhas no objection to the government’s using the college’s in-\nsurers to provide emergency-contraceptive coverage as long \nas it’s not “using” Wheaton’s contract with the insurers or \nrequiring them to provide contraceptives to Wheaton’s stu-\ndents because Wheaton has chosen to opt out. The two condi-\ntions are inconsistent; it’s because Wheaton has opted out that \nthe government is ordering the insurers to provide coverage \nin  lieu  of  Wheaton  rather  than  to  continue  insuring \nWheaton. The first condition, standing alone, would imply \nthat if the government had a contract with an insurer to pro-\nvide  emergency-contraception  coverage  to  all  college  stu-\ndents, or to all college students who sought coverage be-\ncause they were not getting it through their university plans, \nWheaton would be content. (We wonder.) \nWe can’t order the U.S. government not to ask particular \ninsurers  to  insure  Wheaton’s  students  and  employees—\nespecially the insurers that are experienced in dealing with \nthe members of the Wheaton community. As for Wheaton’s \napparent preference that the government discover through \nits own research the names of Wheaton’s insurers, we cannot \nimagine that insistence on this roundabout path to imparting \nessential information to the government could justify a pre-\nliminary injunction, at least in the absence of any explana-\ntion by Wheaton of why it thinks the difference between di-\nrect and roundabout identification of its insurers pertinent to \nits religious commitments.  \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 13 of 18 PageID #:26667\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\nNo. 14-2396  13 \n Wheaton’s complaint, which it has never tried to amend, \nwas filed back in 2013 and sought relief only against having \nto opt out of emergency-contraception coverage by notifying \nthe insurers. That was the only method of opting out author-\nized by federal law at the time. The alternative of being al-\nlowed to notify the government instead of the insurers came \nlater. The college objects emphatically to that alternative as \nwell,  yet  hasn’t  indicated  how  it  thinks  the  government \nwould have learned of its objections had it not sued. It does \nargue that the government has alternatives to making the \ncollege’s  insurers  cover  emergency  contraception,  such  as \ntelling the students and employees to find their own insur-\nance through government-run health exchanges or arrang-\ning  coverage  itself  (maybe  by  creating  an  Emergency-\nContraception  Bureau  in  the  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services). But as we discussed in the Notre Dame \ncase, these alternatives would “involve cumbersome admin-\nistrative machinery and at the same time impose a burden \non [the college’s] female students and employees who want \nto obtain contraceptives.” 786 F.3d at 617. And we don’t un-\nderstand how a government program to provide contracep-\ntion directly to Wheaton’s students and employees would \nrelieve the college of its “complicity” in the provision of the \nforbidden contraceptives: “Were [the college] to hire an un-\nemployed person who, by virtue of becoming employed by \n[the college], obtained contraception coverage for the first \ntime, would not the university be ’triggering’ the new em-\nployee’s access to contraception?” Id.  \nWheaton relies on its Community Covenant, which we \nquoted from and which all students and employees are re-\nquired to sign, for the proposition that its students and em-\nployees share Wheaton’s belief about emergency contracep-\n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 14 of 18 PageID #:26668\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\n14  No. 14-2396 \ntives and so the government has no interest in ensuring their \naccess  to  emergency-contraceptive  coverage.  Remember, \nhowever,  that  the  covenant  does  not  mention  emergency \ncontraception, or for that matter “traditional” contraception \n(which Wheaton does not disapprove); it states merely that \nthe covenant’s signers must “uphold the God-given worth of \nhuman beings, from conception to death.” Wheaton as we \nknow interprets this to prohibit the use of emergency con-\ntraceptives, but do all its students and employees interpret \nthis broad statement in the same way? Must they? And what \nabout the dependents of members of the college community? \nThey don’t have to sign the Community Covenant and may \nnot share Wheaton’s religious beliefs. We haven’t been told \nwhat happens to their coverage of emergency contraception \nif the college prevails in its suit.  \nIf the college is correct that the government has no real \nstake in the provision of such coverage to members of the \nWheaton College community because they’re all signers of \nthe covenant, this actually undermines its case, by suggest-\ning that its insurers are never asked to provide such cover-\nage to members of the college community, making the col-\nlege’s  complaints  academic.  Queried  at  oral  argument \nwhether  any  member  of  the  community  has  ever  been \nknown to violate any of the conditions in the Community \nCovenant, or been expelled or otherwise punished for such a \nviolation, Wheaton’s lawyer said he was unaware of any. \n(The  college’s  student  handbook,  59  pages  of  fine  print, \nwhich is not in the appellate record but is available online at \nwww.wheaton.edu/~/media/Files/Student-Life/StudentHand\nbook-2014-15.pdf, makes clear that students are required to \nadhere to the Community Covenant and describes a wide \nrange of sanctions, but the covenant does not mention con-\n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 15 of 18 PageID #:26669\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\nNo. 14-2396  15 \ntraceptives or contraception coverage.) If the implicit prohi-\nbition of emergency contraception is totally effective—and \nWheaton  College  has  presented  no  evidence,  or  even  al-\nleged, that it is not—the terms of its contracts with its insur-\ners are indeed academic. It’s as if the Affordable Care Act \nhad entitled sterile women to emergency contraceptives. \nThe college refers in its brief to a hypothetical “dissatis-\nfied Wheaton employee who wants” insurance coverage for \nemergency contraceptives. It doesn’t say there are any such \nemployees, however, and implies there are not; for it says \nthat “Wheaton’s employees and students choose to work at \nor attend Wheaton because they share its religious beliefs \nand  wish  to  help  Wheaton  further  its  mission.  Wheaton \nwould violate  their implicit trust in the organization and \ndetrimentally alter its relationship with them if it were to vi-\nolate its religious beliefs regarding abortion.” No one is ask-\ning Wheaton to violate its religious beliefs. Besides, if such a \n“violation” would distress its staff and students, this implies \nthat they indeed adhere to the Community Covenant, and if \nso Wheaton College need have no fear that any of them will \never use the forbidden contraceptives. So far as we know it \nhas no such fear—its “dissatisfied” employee is a chimera. \nThe college tells us as we said that it has no objection \neven to universal coverage by the government of emergency \ncontraception. Yet as that would give the college’s students \nand employees access to the forbidden contraceptives free of \ncharge, the impact on Wheaton would be unaltered from \nwhat it is now. \nThe college advances secondary grounds for the relief \nthat it seeks. One is that the government is discriminating \nagainst the college because churches have been exempted \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 16 of 18 PageID #:26670\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\n16  No. 14-2396 \nfrom the contraception provisions in the Affordable Care Act \nand therefore do not have to notify anyone of their unwill-\ningness  to  provide  their  employees  or  parishioners  with \ncoverage for contraception. Part of the relief it seeks is “re-\nquiring [the government] to treat Wheaton as an exempt ‘re-\nligious employer.’” But Wheaton College does not claim to \nbe a church, or explain how without some notification to the \ngovernment, or to its insurers, an organization that is not, \nlike a church, automatically exempt becomes known to the \ngovernment as having religious views that clash with, and \nentitle it to opt out of, the federal law. At oral argument we \nasked the college’s lawyer whether the college could incor-\nporate itself as a religious organization; he said he didn’t \nknow. \nWheaton further argues that requiring it to ask for an ex-\nemption and to provide the government with the name of its \ninsurer violates its First Amendment rights by compelling it \nto say something that it does not want to say. That would be \nthe equivalent of entitling a tax protester to refuse on First \nAmendment grounds to fill out a 1099 form and mail it to \nthe Internal Revenue Service. Wheaton remains free to voice \nits opposition to the use of emergency contraceptives. “Re-\nquiring Plaintiffs to give notice that they wish to opt out of \nthe  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  no  more  compels \ntheir speech in violation of the First Amendment than does \ndemanding  that  a  conscientious  objector  self-identify  as \nsuch.” Priests for Life v. U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, \n772 F.3d 229, 271 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  \nThe  college  argues  that  the  government  is  violating \nERISA  by  designating  a  third-party  administrator  of \nWheaton College’s health plans to be the plan administrator \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 93 Filed: 08/24/15 Page 17 of 18 PageID #:26671\nCase:C 1a4s-e2:3 1946- 2   3  9D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 28569  2  6  1  4       F   il e  d  :  F0i7le/0d1: /0280/1254 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a1g8es: 18\nNo. 14-2396  17 \nfor  coverage  of  emergency  contraception.  As  we  know, \nwhen notified that a provider of health insurance has reli-\ngious objections to providing (through insurance companies \nor directly) coverage for some government-approved medi-\ncal procedure, the government directs the insurer(s) to pro-\nvide the coverage itself. This direction constitutes what is \ntermed a “plan instrument,” and section 402(a) of ERISA, 29 \nU.S.C. § 1102(a), requires that every employee benefit plan \nbe established and maintained pursuant to a written instru-\nment that must designate one or more named fiduciaries to \nadminister the plan. The plan instrument designates the plan \nadministrator;  the  governmental  plan  instrument  in  this \ncase—the government’s direction to the insurer—designates \nthe  insurer  as  the  plan  administrator.  29  U.S.C. \n§ 1002(16)(A)(i). What had been Wheaton’s plan, so far as \nemergency  contraception  was  concerned,  the  Affordable \nCare Act made the government’s plan when Wheaton re-\nfused to comply with the Act’s provision on contraception \ncoverage. \n  Last the college argues that the government conduct that \nit asks us to enjoin “violates the Administrative Procedure \nAct because it is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.” \nBut this just relabels the grounds for relief that we’ve dis-\ncussed; there is no additional argumentation. \nQuite  apart  from  the  merits  of  its  arguments,  or  lack \nthereof, Wheaton College has failed to satisfy two basic re-\nquirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction. It \nhas failed to show that delaying a judgment in its favor to \nthe conclusion of proceedings in the district court would do \nthe college any harm.

Action No. ___________ \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT   \nOF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES;   \nTHOMAS PEREZ, Secretary    Jury Demanded \nof the United States Department of Labor;   \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nLABOR; \nJACOB LEW, Secretary of the United  \nStates Department of the Treasury; and  \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF   \nTHE TREASURY, \n \n    Defendants. \n \n \n \nCOMPLAINT \nComes now Plaintiff, Wheaton College, by and through its attorneys, and states as \nfollows: \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  This is a challenge to regulations issued under the 2010 “Affordable Care Act” \nthat force employee and student health insurance plans to provide free coverage of \ncontraceptives, sterilizations, and drugs and devices that cause early abortions (the “Final \nMandate”).   \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 2 of 48 PageID #:2\n2.  Plaintiff, Wheaton College (“Wheaton”), is a Christian liberal arts college located \nin Wheaton, Illinois. Wheaton’s religious beliefs forbid it from participating in, providing access \nto, paying for, designating others to pay for, training others to engage in, or otherwise supporting \nabortion. Wheaton is among the many American religious organizations that hold these beliefs.  \n3.  In light of these religious beliefs, Wheaton cannot participate in the government’s \nregulatory scheme to promote, encourage, and subsidize the use of drugs and devices that cause \nabortions.  Under the Final Mandate, however, Wheaton faces millions of dollars in fines for this \nreligious exercise. \n4.  Defendants have exempted thousands of plans, covering tens of millions of \nemployees, from the Final Mandate.  These exemptions have been granted for a wide variety of \nreasons, from the purely secular exemption for plans in existence before a certain date \n(“grandfathered plans”) to a narrow religious exemption for certain “religious employers.”   \n5.  Despite its obvious religious nature, Wheaton does not qualify for any \nexemptions.  While “religious employers” are exempted, Defendants have limited that exemption \nto protect only “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of \nchurches” and “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” That is because, in the \neyes of the government, Wheaton’s work educating students “For Christ and His Kingdom” is \nnot an “exclusively religious activity.” \n6.  The regulations do offer Wheaton and other non-exempt religious organizations \nwhat Defendants have labeled an “accommodation.” But the “accommodation” still requires \nWheaton to play a central role in the government’s scheme, because it must designate an agent to \npay for the objectionable services on Wheaton’s behalf, and it has to take steps to trigger and \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  2 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 3 of 48 PageID #:3\nfacilitate that coverage. Wheaton cannot take these actions to facilitate this coverage without \nviolating its religious beliefs. \n7.  The supposed “accommodation” also continues to treat Wheaton as a second-class \nreligious organization, not entitled to the same religious freedom rights as other religious \norganizations, including any religious schools that are “integrated auxiliaries” of churches.  \n8.  The “accommodation” also creates administrative hurdles and other difficulties \nfor Wheaton, forcing it to seek out and contract with companies willing to provide the very drugs \nand services it speaks out against. \n9.  If Wheaton does not compromise its religious convictions and comply with the \nregulations, however, it faces severe penalties that could exceed $25.7 million each year. \n10.  By placing Wheaton in this impossible position, Defendants have violated the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, as well as the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free \nSpeech Clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, The Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. \n11.  Wheaton therefore respectfully requests declaratory and permanent injunctive \nrelief. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and \n§ 1361. This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. This Court has \njurisdiction to render declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000bb-1. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  3 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 4 of 48 PageID #:4\n13.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). A substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district, and Plaintiff resides in \nthis district. \nIDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff Wheaton College is a liberal arts college in Wheaton, Illinois. Founded in \n1860 by abolitionist Jonathan Blanchard, Wheaton’s mission is to “serve[] Jesus Christ and \nadvance[] his kingdom through excellence in liberal arts and graduate programs that educate the \nwhole person to build the church and benefit society worldwide.”  Wheaton’s motto is “For \nChrist and His Kingdom.” \n15.  Defendants are appointed officials of the United States government and the \nUnited States governmental agencies responsible for issuing the Mandate.   \n16.  Defendant Kathleen Sebelius is the Secretary of the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Services (“HHS”). In this capacity, she has responsibility for the operation \nand management of HHS. Sebelius is sued in her official capacity only. \n17.  Defendant HHS is an executive agency of the United States government and is \nresponsible for the promulgation, administration, and enforcement of the Mandate. \n18.  Defendant Thomas Perez is the Secretary of the United States Department of \nLabor. In this capacity, he has responsibility for the operation and management of the \nDepartment of Labor. Perez is sued in his official capacity only. \n19.  Defendant Department of Labor is an executive agency of the United States \ngovernment and is responsible for the promulgation, administration, and enforcement of the \nMandate.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  4 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 5 of 48 PageID #:5\n20.  Defendant Jacob Lew is the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury. In this \ncapacity, he has responsibility for the operation and management of the Department of the \nTreasury. Lew is sued in his official capacity only. \n21.  Defendant Department of Treasury is an executive agency of the United States \ngovernment and is responsible for the promulgation, administration, and enforcement of the \nMandate.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Wheaton’s Religious Beliefs and Practices Related to Insurance for Abortion \n22.  Wheaton is a liberal arts college located in Wheaton, Illinois. It was founded in \n1860 by abolitionist Jonathan Blanchard.  \n23.  Today, Wheaton “is an institution of higher learning, a rigorous academic \ncommunity that takes seriously the life of the mind.” See http://www.wheaton.edu/About-\nWheaton/Community-Covenant. Wheaton offers 59 undergraduate degree programs and 22 \ngraduate degree programs, including five doctoral programs. \n24.  Faith is central to the education mission of Wheaton. Wheaton aspires “to live, \nwork, serve, and worship together as an educational community centered around the Lord Jesus \nChrist.” Wheaton College, Community Covenant, http://www.wheaton.edu/about-\nwheaton/community-covenant. \n25.  Wheaton’s purpose is expressed in its mission statement: “Wheaton College \nserves Jesus Christ and advances his kingdom through excellence in liberal arts and graduate \nprograms that educate the whole person to build the church and benefit society worldwide.”  \n26.  Wheaton’s motto is “For Christ and His Kingdom.”  \n27.  In order to further its mission, Wheaton has a longstanding conviction that \nappropriate “institutional standards” help to “foster the kind of campus atmosphere most \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  5 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 6 of 48 PageID #:6\nconductive to becoming the Christian community of living, learning, and serving that Wheaton \nCollege aspires to be.” \n28.  Each year, all Wheaton students and full-time employees voluntarily commit \nthemselves to this community by signing Wheaton’s Community Covenant.   \n29.  In addition to signing the Community Covenant, Wheaton’s Board of Trustees, \nfaculty, and staff annually reaffirm Wheaton’s doctrinal statement, which provides a summary of \nbiblical doctrine that is consonant with Evangelical Christianity. See \nhttp://www.wheaton.edu/About-Wheaton/Statement-of-Faith-and-Educational-Purpose. \n30.  Wheaton’s Community Covenant recognizes that Scripture condemns the taking \nof innocent life. (Wheaton College, Community Covenant, http://www.wheaton.edu/about-\nwheaton/community-covenant.) \n31.  Wheaton holds religious beliefs that include traditional Christian teachings on the \nsanctity of life. Wheaton believes and teaches that each human being bears the image and \nlikeness of God, and therefore that all human life is sacred and precious, from the moment of \nconception. Wheaton therefore believes and teaches that abortion ends a human life and is a sin. \n32.  Wheaton is registered as a tax-exempt organization under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3). \n33.  Wheaton is not a church, an integrated auxiliary of a church, or a convention or \nassociation of churches as defined by 26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i). \n34.  Wheaton is not a religious order as defined by 26 U.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(iii). \n35.  Wheaton is not a church or a convention or association of churches as defined by \n26 U.S.C. § 414(e).  \n36.  Wheaton has about 2,400 undergraduate and 600 graduate students.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  6 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 7 of 48 PageID #:7\n37.  Wheaton has about 709 full-time and 161 part-time employees as of December 2, \n2013.   \n38.  As part of its religious convictions, Wheaton promotes the well-being and health \nof its students and employees. This includes provision of generous health services and health \ninsurance for its students and employees.  \n39.  Wheaton’s religious beliefs prohibit it from deliberately providing insurance \ncoverage for drugs, procedures, or services inconsistent with its faith, in particular abortion-\ninducing drugs, abortion procedures, and related services. \n40.  It is similarly a violation of Wheaton’s religious beliefs to deliberately provide \nhealth insurance that would facilitate access to abortion-causing drugs, abortion procedures, and \nrelated services, even if those items were paid for by an insurer or a plan administrator and not \nby Wheaton.  \n41.  Wheaton has no religious objection to providing coverage for contraceptive drugs \nand devices that prevent conception (as opposed to interfering with the continued survival of a \nhuman embryo).  \n42.  Wheaton’s employees and students choose to work at or attend Wheaton because \nthey share its religious beliefs and wish to help Wheaton further its mission. Wheaton would \nviolate their implicit trust in the organization and detrimentally alter its relationship with them if \nit were to violate its religious beliefs regarding abortion. \n43.  Wheaton has expended significant resources working with its insurers and plan \nadministrators to ensure that its health insurance policies reflect Wheaton’s religious beliefs.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  7 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 8 of 48 PageID #:8\n44.  On September 27, 2011, Wheaton submitted public comments on the Interim \nFinal Rule on Preventative Services published on August 3, 2011 (76 Fed. Reg. 46621).1 \nWheaton’s comments expressed its concern that the interim final rule failed to recognize it as a \nreligious employer and that the rule violates Wheaton’s rights of conscience.  \n45.  On June 19, 2012, Wheaton submitted public comments on the Advance Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking on Preventative Services published on March 21, 2012 (77 Fed. Reg. \n16501). Wheaton’s comments reiterated its concerns about the interim final rule, particularly \nDefendants’ refusal to provide it and similar religious employers with the same exemption \nafforded to churches.   \n46.  The plan year for Wheaton’s employee insurance plans began on July 1, 2013 and \na new plan year will begin on July 1, 2014. \n47.  Wheaton made certain changes to its employee insurance plans effective April 1, \n2012, that render Wheaton healthcare plans ineligible for grandfathered status. See 45 C.F.R. § \n147.140(a)(1)(i), 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a)(1)(i). In \nparticular, Wheaton removed coverage for prescription drugs from two of its employee insurance \nplans and created new drug benefit plans for employees. None of these plans are grandfathered. \nII.  The Affordable Care Act and Preventive Care Mandate \n48.  In March 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148 (March 23, 2010), and the Health \nCare and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub. L. 111-152 (March 30, 2010), collectively known \nas the “Affordable Care Act.” \n                                                 \n1  Letter from President Philip G. Ryken, President, Wheaton College, to IRS Commissioner \nDouglas H. Shulman (Sept. 27, 2011), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=IRS-\n2010-0017-0975.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  8 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 9 of 48 PageID #:9\n49.  The Affordable Care Act regulates the national health insurance market by \ndirectly regulating “group health plans” and “health insurance issuers.” \n50.  One provision of the Act mandates that any “group health plan” or “health \ninsurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage” must provide coverage \nfor certain preventive care services. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a). \n51.  The services required to be covered include medications, screenings, and \ncounseling given an “A” or “B” rating by the United States Preventive Services Task Force;2 \nimmunizations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention; and “preventive care and screenings” specific to \ninfants, children, adolescents, and women, as to be “provided for in comprehensive guidelines \nsupported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(1)-\n(4).  \n52.  The statute specifies that all of these services must be provided without “any cost \nsharing.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a).  \n                                                 \n2 The list of services that currently have an “A” or “B” rating include medications like aspirin for \npreventing cardiovascular disease, vitamin D, and folic acid; screenings for a wide range of conditions \nsuch as depression, certain cancers and sexually-transmitted diseases, intimate partner violence, obesity, \nand osteoporosis; and various counseling services, including for breastfeeding, sexually-transmitted \ndiseases, smoking, obesity, healthy dieting, cancer, and so forth. See U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, \nUSPSTF A and B Recommendations, \nhttp://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsabrecs.htm (last visited Dec. 2, 2013) (Ex. A); \nsee also 75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41740 (2010). \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  9 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 10 of 48 PageID #:10\n    The Interim Final Rule \n53.  On July 19, 2010, HHS3 published an interim final rule promulgating directives \nconcerning the Affordable Care Act’s requirement for coverage of preventive services without \ncost sharing. 75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41728 (2010).  \n54.  The interim final rule was enacted without prior notice of rulemaking or \nopportunity for public comment, because Defendants determined for themselves that “it would \nbe impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay putting the provisions . . . in place \nuntil a full public notice and comment process was completed.” 75 Fed. Reg. at 41730. \n55.  Although Defendants suggested in the Interim Final Rule that they would solicit \npublic comments after implementation, they stressed that “provisions of the Affordable Care Act \nprotect significant rights” and therefore it was expedient that “participants, beneficiaries, \ninsureds, plan sponsors, and issuers have certainty about their rights and responsibilities.” Id. \n56.  Defendants stated they would later “provide the public with an opportunity for \ncomment, but without delaying the effective date of the regulations,” demonstrating their intent \nto impose the regulations regardless of the legal flaws or general opposition that might be \nmanifest in public comments. Id. \n57.  In addition to reiterating the Affordable Care Act’s preventive services coverage \nrequirements, the Interim Final Rule provided further guidance concerning the Act’s restriction \non cost sharing. \n58.  The Interim Final Rule made clear that “cost sharing” refers to “out-of-pocket” \nexpenses for plan participants and beneficiaries. 75 Fed. Reg. at 41730. \n                                                 \n3 For ease of reading, references to “HHS” in this Complaint refer to all Defendants, unless \ncontext indicates otherwise. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  10 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 11 of 48 PageID #:11\n59.  The Interim Final Rule acknowledged that, without cost sharing, expenses \n“previously paid out-of-pocket” would “now be covered by group health plans and issuers” and \nthat those expenses would, in turn, result in “higher average premiums for all enrollees.” Id.; see \nalso id. at 41737 (“Such a transfer of costs could be expected to lead to an increase in \npremiums.”). \n60.  In other words, the prohibition on cost-sharing was simply a way “to distribute the \ncost of preventive services more equitably across the broad insured population.” 75 Fed. Reg. at \n41730. \n61.  After the Interim Final Rule was issued, numerous commenters warned against \nthe potential conscience implications of requiring religious individuals and organizations to \ninclude certain kinds of services—specifically contraception, sterilization, and abortion \nservices—in their health care plans. \n62.  HHS directed a private health policy organization, the Institute of Medicine \n(IOM), to make recommendations regarding which drugs, procedures, and services should be \nconsidered in comprehensive guidelines for preventive care for women.  \n63.  IOM was not tasked with making insurance coverage recommendations and \nexplicitly excluded cost considerations and other considerations relevant to coverage \nrecommendations from its determinations regarding effective preventive care for women. \n64.  In developing its guidelines, IOM invited a select number of groups to make \npresentations on the preventive care that should be mandated by all health plans. These were the \nGuttmacher Institute, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), John \nSantelli, the National Women’s Law Center, National Women’s Health Network, Planned \nParenthood Federation of America, and Sara Rosenbaum.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  11 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 12 of 48 PageID #:12\n65.  No religious groups or other groups that opposed government-mandated coverage \nof contraception, sterilization, abortion, and related education and counseling were among the \ninvited presenters. \n66.  On July 19, 2011, the IOM published its preventive care guidelines for women, \nincluding a recommendation that preventive services include all “Food and Drug Administration \napproved contraceptive methods [and] sterilization procedures.” Institute of Medicine, Clinical \nPreventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps, at 102-10 and Recommendation 5.5 (2011). \n67.  FDA-approved contraceptive methods include birth-control pills; prescription \ncontraceptive devices such as IUDs; Plan B (also known as the “morning-after pill”); ulipristal \n(also known as “ella” or the “week-after pill”); and other drugs, devices, and procedures.  \n68.  Some of these drugs and devices—including the “emergency contraceptives” Plan \nB, ella, and certain IUDs—are known abortifacients, in that they can cause the death of an \nembryo by preventing it from implanting in the wall of the uterus.  \n69.  Indeed, the FDA’s own Birth Control guide states that both Plan B and ella can \nwork by “preventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus).”4  \n70.  Although it mentioned emergency contraceptives in passing, the IOM Report \nincluded no separate analysis of known abortifacients like Plan B and ella. See generally Institute \nof Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps, at 102-10 and \nRecommendation 5.5 (2011). \n71.  The conditions under which the IOM Report was prepared prompted one member \nof the drafting committee to file a dissent, in which he stated that “the committee process for \nevaluation of the evidence lacked transparency and was largely subject to the preferences of the \n                                                 \n4 FDA, Birth Control: Medicines to Help You, http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ \nByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/ucm313215.htm  (last visited Dec. 2, 2013) (Ex. B). \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  12 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 13 of 48 PageID #:13\ncommittee’s composition. Troublingly, the process tended to result in a mix of objective and \nsubjective determinations filtered through a lens of advocacy.” Institute of Medicine, Clinical \nPreventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps, at 232-233 (2011). The dissent deemed the \nevidence evaluation process a “fatal flaw” and concluded that “the committee erred [in] their zeal \nto recommend something despite the time constraints and a far from perfect methodology” and \n“failed to demonstrate [transparency and strict objectivity] in the Report.” Id.  \n72.  On August 1, 2011, thirteen days after IOM issued its recommendations, HHS’s \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) issued guidelines adopting them in \nfull.5  \nThe “Religious Employers” Exemption \n73.  That same day, HHS promulgated an additional Interim Final Rule. 76 Fed. Reg. \n46621 (published Aug. 3, 2011). \n74.  This Second Interim Final Rule granted HRSA “discretion to exempt certain \nreligious employers from the Guidelines where contraceptive services are concerned.” 76 Fed. \nReg. 46621, 46623 (emphasis added). The term “religious employer” was restrictively defined as \none that (1) has as its purpose the “inculcation of religious values”; (2) “primarily employs \npersons who share the religious tenets of the organization”; (3) “serves primarily persons who \nshare the religious tenets of the organization”; and (4) “is a nonprofit organization as described \nin section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \nas amended.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 46626.  \n                                                 \n5 HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, http://www.hrsa.gov/ womensguidelines (last \nvisited Dec. 2, 2013) (Ex. C). \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  13 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 14 of 48 PageID #:14\n75.  The fourth of these requirements refers to “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, \nand conventions or associations of churches” and the “exclusively religious activities of any \nreligious order.” 26 U.S.C.A. § 6033.  \n76.  Thus, the “religious employers” exemption was severely limited to formal \nchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and religious orders whose purpose is to inculcate faith and \nthat hire and serve primarily people of their own faith tradition. \n77.  HRSA exercised its discretion to grant an exemption for religious employers via a \nfootnote on its website listing the Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines. The footnote states \nthat “guidelines concerning contraceptive methods and counseling described above do not apply \nto women who are participants or beneficiaries in group health plans sponsored by religious \nemployers.”6   \n78.  Although religious organizations like Wheaton share the same religious beliefs \nand concerns as objecting churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and objecting religious orders, \nHHS deliberately ignored the regulation’s impact on their religious liberty, stating that the \nexemption sought only “to provide for a religious accommodation that respects the unique \nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.” 76 Fed. \nReg. at 46623. \n79.   Thus, thousands of religious organizations that cannot comply with the mandate \nfor religious reasons were excluded from the “religious employers” exemption.  \n80.  Like the original Interim Final Rule, the Second Interim Final Rule was made \neffective immediately, without prior notice or opportunity for public comment.  \n                                                 \n6 HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines, http://www.hrsa.gov/ womensguidelines (Ex. \nC). \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  14 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 15 of 48 PageID #:15\n81.  Defendants acknowledged that “while a general notice of proposed rulemaking \nand an opportunity for public comment is generally required before promulgation of \nregulations,” they had “good cause” to conclude that public comment was “impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest” in this instance. 76 Fed. Reg. at 46624. \n82.  Upon information and belief, after the Second Interim Final Rule was put into \neffect, over 100,000 comments were submitted opposing the narrow scope of the “religious \nemployers” exemption and protesting the contraception mandate’s gross infringement on the \nrights of religious individuals and organizations. \n83.  HHS did not take into account the concerns of religious organizations in the \ncomments submitted before the Second Interim Rule was issued.  \n84.  Instead the Second Interim Rule was unresponsive to the concerns, including \nclaims of statutory and constitutional conscience rights, stated in the comments submitted by \nreligious organizations. \nThe Safe Harbor \n85.  The public outcry for a broader religious employer exemption continued for many \nmonths and, on January 20, 2012, HHS issued a press release acknowledging “the important \nconcerns some have raised about religious liberty” and stating that religious objectors would be \n“provided an additional year . . . to comply with the new law.”7  \n86.  On February 10, 2012, HHS formally announced a “safe harbor” for non-exempt \nnonprofit religious organizations that objected to the Mandate. See HHS Center for Consumer \nInformation and Insurance Oversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for \nCertain Employers (Feb. 10, 2012); see also HHS Center for Consumer Information and \n                                                 \n7 Press Release, A Statement by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary \nKathleen Sebelius (Jan. 20, 2012), http://www.hhs.gov/news/press /2012pres/01/20120120a.html (Ex. D). \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  15 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 16 of 48 PageID #:16\nInsurance Oversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain \nEmployers (Aug. 15, 2012) (changing the safe harbor eligibility criteria). \n87.  Under the safe harbor, HHS agreed it would not take any enforcement action \nagainst an eligible organization during the safe harbor, which would remain in effect until the \nfirst plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2013. HHS later extended the safe harbor to the \nfirst plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2014. HHS Center for Consumer Information and \nInsurance Oversight, Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain \nEmployers (June 28, 2013). \n88.  HHS also indicated it would develop and propose changes to the regulations to \naccommodate the objections of non-exempt, nonprofit religious organizations following August \n1, 2013.  \n89.  Despite the safe harbor and HHS’s accompanying promises, on February 15, \n2012, HHS published a final rule “finaliz[ing], without change,” the contraception and \nabortifacient mandate and narrow religious employers exemption. 77 Fed. Reg. 8725-01 \n(published Feb. 15, 2012).  \nThe Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n90.  On March 21, 2012, HHS issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n(ANPRM), presenting “questions and ideas” to “help shape” a discussion of how to “maintain \nthe provision of contraceptive coverage without cost sharing,” while accommodating the \nreligious beliefs of non-exempt religious organizations. 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503 (2012).  \n91.  The ANPRM conceded that forcing religious organizations to “contract, arrange, \nor pay for” the objectionable contraceptive and abortifacient servicers would infringe their \n“religious liberty interests.” Id. (emphasis added).  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  16 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 17 of 48 PageID #:17\n92.  In vague terms, the ANPRM proposed that the “health insurance issuers” for \nobjecting religious employers could be required to “assume the responsibility for the provision of \ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing.” Id.  \n93.  For self-insured plans, the ANPRM suggested that third party plan administrators \n“assume this responsibility.” Id.  \n94.  For the first time, and contrary to the earlier definition of “cost sharing,” \nDefendants suggested in the ANPRM that insurers and third party administrators could be \nprohibited from passing along their costs to the objecting religious organizations via increased \npremiums. See id.  \n95.  “[A]pproximately 200,000 comments” were submitted in response to the \nANPRM. 78 Fed. Reg. 8456, 8459 (published February 6, 2013). Many of these comments \nreiterated previous comments that the ANPRM’s proposals would not resolve conscientious \nobjections, because the objecting religious organizations, by providing a health care plan in the \nfirst instance, would still be coerced to arrange for and facilitate access to religiously-\nobjectionable drugs and services. \nThe Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n96.  On February 1, 2013, HHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) \npurportedly addressing the comments submitted in response to the ANPRM. 78 Fed. Reg. 8456. \n97.  The NPRM proposed two changes to the then-existing regulations. 78 Fed. Reg. \n8456, 8458-59. \n98.  First, it proposed revising the religious employers exemption by eliminating the \nrequirements that religious employers have the purpose of inculcating religious values and \nprimarily employ and serve only persons of their same faith. 78 Fed. Reg. at 8461 \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  17 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 18 of 48 PageID #:18\n99.  Under this proposal a “religious employer” would be one “that is organized and \noperates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or [](iii) of the \nInternal Revenue Code.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 8474.  \n100.  HHS emphasized, however, that this proposal “would not expand the universe of \nemployer plans that would qualify for the exemption beyond that which was intended in the 2012 \nfinal rules.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 8461.  \n101.  In other words, religious organizations like Wheaton that are not formal churches \nwould continue to be excluded from the exemption.  \n102.  Second, the NPRM reiterated HHS’s intention to “accommodate” non-exempt, \nnonprofit religious organizations by making them “designate” their insurers to provide plan \nparticipants and beneficiaries with free access to contraceptive and abortifacient drugs and \nservices. \n103.  The proposed “accommodation” did not resolve the concerns of religious \norganizations like Wheaton because it continued to force them to deliberately provide health \ninsurance and take actions that would trigger access to religiously-objectionable drugs and \nrelated education and counseling. \n104.  In issuing the NPRM, HHS requested comments from the public by April 8, 2013. \n78 Fed. Reg. at 8457. \n105.  “[O]ver 400,000 comments” were submitted in response to the NPRM, 78 Fed. \nReg. 39870, 39871 (published July 2, 2013), with religious organizations again overwhelmingly \ndecrying the proposed accommodation as a gross violation of their religious liberty because it \nwould conscript their health care plans as the main cog in the government’s scheme for \nexpanding access to contraceptive and abortifacient services. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  18 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 19 of 48 PageID #:19\n106.  Wheaton submitted comments on the NPRM, stating essentially the same \nobjections stated in this complaint.8  \n107.  On April 8, 2013, the same day the notice-and-comment period ended, Defendant \nSecretary Sebelius answered questions about the contraceptive and abortifacient services \nrequirement in a presentation at Harvard University. \n108.  In her remarks, Secretary Sebelius stated:  \nWe have just completed the open comment period for the so-called \naccommodation, and by August 1st of this year, every employer will be covered \nby the law with one exception. Churches and church dioceses as employers are \nexempted from this benefit. But Catholic hospitals, Catholic universities, other \nreligious entities will be providing coverage to their employees starting August \n1st. . . . [A]s of August 1st, 2013, every employee who doesn’t work directly for a \nchurch or a diocese will be included in the benefit package.9 \n109.  It is clear from the timing of these remarks that Defendants gave no consideration \nto the comments submitted in response to the NPRM’s proposed “accommodation.” It is also \nclear that the Secretary recognizes that even under the accommodation, “religious entities” like \nWheaton “will be providing coverage” for the drugs required by the Mandate.  \nThe Final Mandate \n110.  On June 28, 2013, Defendants issued a final rule (the “Final Mandate”), which \nignores the objections repeatedly raised by religious organizations and continues to co-opt \nobjecting religious employers into the government’s scheme of expanding free access to \ncontraceptive and abortifacient services. 78 Fed. Reg. 39870. \n                                                 \n8 Letter from President Philip G. Ryken, President, Wheaton College, to HHS Secretary Kathleen \nSebelius (April 8, 2013) (Ex. E). \n9 The Forum at Harvard School of Public Health, A Conversation with Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Apr. 8, 2013, \nhttp://theforum.sph.harvard.edu/events/conversation-kathleen-sebelius (last visited Dec. 2, 2013) (from \n51:20 to 53:56) (emphases added) . A permanent link to the relevant section of Sec. Sebelius’ remarks is \navailable here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py6aSwQl-2g&feature=youtu.be (last visited Dec. 2, \n2013). \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  19 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 20 of 48 PageID #:20\n111.  Under the Final Mandate, the discretionary “religious employers” exemption, \nwhich is still implemented via footnote on the HRSA website, Ex. C, remains limited to formal \nchurches and religious orders “organized and operate[d]” as nonprofit entities and “referred to in \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. \n112.  All other religious organizations, including Wheaton, are excluded from the \nexemption.  \n113.  The Final Mandate creates a separate “accommodation” for certain non-exempt \nreligious organizations. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. \n114.  An organization is eligible for the accommodation if it (1) “[o]pposes providing \ncoverage for some or all of the contraceptive services required”; (2) “is organized and operates \nas a nonprofit entity”; (3) “holds itself out as a religious organization”; and (4) “self-certifies that \nit satisfies the first three criteria.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. \n115.  The self-certification must be executed “prior to the beginning of the first plan \nyear to which an accommodation is to apply.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39875.  \n116.  The Final Rule extends the current safe harbor through the end of 2013. 78 Fed. \nReg. at 39889; see also HHS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, \nGuidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers (June 28, 2013) \n(extending the safe harbor to the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2014).  \n117.  Thus, an eligible organization would need to execute the self-certification prior to \nits first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2014, and deliver it to the organization’s \ninsurer or, if the organization has a self-insured plan, to the plan’s third party administrator. 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39875. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  20 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 21 of 48 PageID #:21\n118.  By the terms of the accommodation, Wheaton will be required to execute the self-\ncertification and deliver it to its insurers and plan administrators before July 1, 2014. \n119.  By delivering its self-certification to its insurers and third-party administrators, \nWheaton would trigger their obligations to “provide[] payments for contraceptive services,” \nincluding abortion-causing contraceptives like Plan B and Ella. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39876 (insurers) \nsee also id. at 39879 (third party administrators). \n120.  In the case of its self-insured plan, Wheaton’s self-certification acts as “a \ndesignation of the third party administrator(s) as plan administrator and claims administrator for \ncontraceptive benefits pursuant to section 3(16) of ERISA.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39879.   \n121.  The administrator or insurer would be required to “provide payments for \ncontraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39876 (insurers); \nsee also id. at 39879 (third-party administrators).  \n122.  In order for this obligation to be effective, Wheaton would have to identify its \nemployees to the insurer or third-party administrator for the distinct purpose of enabling the \ngovernment’s scheme to facilitate free access to contraceptive and abortifacient services. \n123.  The insurer’s obligation to make direct payments for contraceptive and abortion \nservices would continue only “for so long as the participant or beneficiary remains enrolled in \nthe plan.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39876. \n124.  Thus Wheaton would have to coordinate with its insurer or third-party \nadministrator regarding when it was adding or removing employees and beneficiaries from its \nhealthcare plan and, as a result, from the abortifacient services payment scheme. \n125.  Insurers and third-party administrators would be required to notify plan \nparticipants and beneficiaries of the contraceptive payment benefit “contemporaneous with (to \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  21 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 22 of 48 PageID #:22\nthe extent possible), but separate from, any application materials distributed in connection with \nenrollment (or re-enrollment) in coverage . . . .” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39880 (third-party \nadministrators); see also id. at 39876 (insurers).  \n126.  This would also require Wheaton to coordinate the notices with its insurers and \nadministrators. \n127.  Thus, even under the accommodation, Wheaton and every other non-exempt \nobjecting religious organization would continue to play a central role in facilitating free access to \nabortifacient drugs. \n128.  The insurer would be required to provide the contraceptive benefits “in a manner \nconsistent” with the provision of other covered services. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39876-77.  \n129.  Thus, any payment or coverage disputes presumably would be resolved under the \nterms of Wheaton’s existing plan documents. \n130.  Under the accommodation, group health insurance issuers “may not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any \npremium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible \norganization.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39896 (emphasis added). \n131.  For all other preventive services, including non-contraceptive preventive services \nfor women, only cost-sharing (i.e., out-of-pocket expense) is prohibited. There is no restriction \non passing along costs via premiums or other charges. \n132.  Defendants state that they “continue to believe, and have evidence to support,” \nthat providing payments for contraceptive and abortifacient services will be “cost neutral for \nissuers,” because “[s]everal studies have estimated that the costs of providing contraceptive \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  22 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 23 of 48 PageID #:23\ncoverage are balanced by cost savings from lower pregnancy-related costs and from \nimprovements in women’s health.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39877.  \n133.  On information and belief, the studies Defendants rely upon to support this claim \nare severely flawed.  \n134.  Nevertheless, even if the payments were—over time—to become cost neutral, it is \nundisputed that there will be up-front costs for making the payments. See, e.g., 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39877-78, 39880 (addressing ways insurers and administrators can cover up-front costs). \n135.  Moreover, if cost savings arise that make insuring an employer’s employees \ncheaper, the savings would have to be passed on to employers through reduced premiums, not \nretained by insurance issuers. \n136.  HHS suggests that, to maintain cost neutrality, issuers may simply ignore this fact \nand “set the premium for an eligible organization’s large group policy as if no payments for \ncontraceptive services had been provided to plan participants.” 78 Fed. Reg. at 39877.  \n137.  This encourages issuers to artificially inflate the eligible organization’s premiums.  \n138.  Under this methodology—even assuming its legality—the eligible organization \nwould still bear the cost of the required payments for contraceptive, sterilization, and \nabortifacient services in violation of its conscience, as if the accommodation had never been \nmade. \n139.  Defendants have suggested that “[a]nother option” would be to “treat the cost of \npayments for contraceptive services . . . as an administrative cost that is spread across the \nissuer’s entire risk pool, excluding plans established or maintained by eligible organizations.” 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39878.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  23 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 24 of 48 PageID #:24\n140.  There is no legal authority for forcing third parties to pay for services provided to \neligible organizations under the accommodation. \n141.  Furthermore, under the Affordable Care Act, Defendants lack authority in the first \nplace to coerce insurers to directly purchase contraceptive, sterilization, and abortifacient \nservices for an eligible organization’s plan participants and beneficiaries.  \n142.  Thus, the accommodation fails to protect objecting religious organizations for \nlack of statutory authority. \n143.  Currently, Wheaton operates a self-insured prescription drug plan administered by \nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. Because under the Affordable Care Act Wheaton would be \nrequired to identify and designate an administrator willing to administer the abortifacient \nservices, Wheaton’s religious beliefs preclude it from complying with the accommodation. \n144.  For all these reasons, the accommodation does nothing to relieve non-exempt \nreligious organizations—such as Wheaton—from being co-opted as the central cog in the \ngovernment’s scheme to expand access to free abortifacient services.  \n145.  The Final Rule sets forth complex means through which a third party \nadministrator may seek to recover its costs incurred in making payments for contraceptive and \nabortifacient services.  \n146.  The third party administrator must identify an issuer who participates in the \nfederal exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act and who would be willing to make \npayments on behalf of the third party administrator.  \n147.  Cooperating issuers would then be authorized to obtain refunds from the user fees \nthey have paid to participate in the federal exchange as a means of being reimbursed for making \npayments for contraceptive and abortifacient services on behalf of the third party administrator.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  24 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 25 of 48 PageID #:25\n148.   Issuers would be required to pay a portion of the refund back to the third party \nadministrator to compensate it for any administrative expenses it has incurred. \n149.  These machinations, ostensibly employed only to shift the cost of the Final \nMandate, are severely flawed.  \n150.  There is no way to ensure that the cost of administering the contraceptive and \nabortifacient services would not be passed on to religious organizations through the third party \nadministrator’s fees.  \n151.  Moreover, taking the user fees intended for funding the federal exchanges and \nusing them to provide contraceptive and abortifacient services to employees not participating in \nthe federal exchanges would violate the statute authorizing the user fees. See 78 Fed. Reg. \n15410, 15412 (published March 11, 2013); 31 U.S.C. § 9701.  \n152.  In sum, for non-exempt religious organizations like Wheaton, the accommodation \nis nothing more than a shell game that attempts to disguise the religious organization’s role as the \ncentral cog in the government’s scheme for expanding access to abortifacient services. \n153.  Despite the accommodation’s convoluted machinations, a religious organization’s \ndecision to offer health insurance and its self-certification continue to serve as the sole triggers \nfor creating access to free abortifacient services.  \n154.  Wheaton cannot participate in or facilitate the government’s scheme in this \nmanner without violating its religious convictions. \nWheaton’s Health Care Plan and Its Religious Objections \n155.  The plan year for Wheaton’s student healthcare plan begins on July 1 of each \nyear. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  25 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 26 of 48 PageID #:26\n156.  Wheaton’s student health care plan consists of an insured plan issued by \nCompanion Life Insurance Company. \n157.  The Final Mandate declares that the rules concerning contraceptive, sterilization, \nand abortifacient services will “apply to student health insurance coverage arranged by an \neligible organization that is an institution of higher education in a manner comparable to that in \nwhich they apply to group health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health \nplan established or maintained by an eligible organization that is an employer.” 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39897. \n158.  Thus, beginning on or about July 1, 2014, Wheaton faces the choice of either \nincluding free coverage for abortifacient services in its student health plan or else forcing its \ninsurance issuer to provide the exact same services. \n159.  The next plan year for Wheaton’s employee healthcare plan begins on July 1, \n2014. Wheaton provides three health insurance plans to its full-time employees. Those plans \ninclude two HMO plans offered through BlueCross/BlueShield of Illinois and one PPO plan, \nwhich is self-funded and administered by BlueCross/BlueShield of Illinois. As a supplement to \nthe HMO plans, Wheaton now offers two self-funded prescription drug plans. \n160.  Wheaton’s self-insured PPO insurance plan has not changed significantly since \nMarch 23, 2010, and meets the definition of a “grandfathered” plan. See 45 C.F.R. § \n147.140(a)(1)(i); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251(a)(1)(i).  \n161.  However, Wheaton’s insured HMO plans and its self-funded prescription drug \nplans have changed significantly since March 23, 2010, and due to the changes they have not \nincluded the statements regarding grandfathered status required under federal law.  Thus, \nWheaton’s insured HMO healthcare plans do not meet the definition of a “grandfathered” plan. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  26 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 27 of 48 PageID #:27\nSee 45 C.F.R. § 147.140(a)(1)(i); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T(a)(1)(i); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-\n1251(a)(1)(i). \n162.  Thus, beginning on or about July 1, 2014, Wheaton faces the choice of either \nincluding free coverage for abortifacient services in its insured HMO employee health plans and \nits self-funded prescription drug plans or else designating its administrator to provide the exact \nsame services. \n163.  Wheaton has no objection to including, and already does include, free coverage \nfor women’s preventive services such as mammograms. It also has no conscientious objection to \nproviding access contraceptives that do not inhibit implantation of an embryo, and currently \ncovers those drugs.  \n164.  However, Wheaton’s religious convictions forbid it from including free coverage \nfor abortifacient drugs in any of its healthcare plans. \n165.  Wheaton’s religious convictions equally forbid it from hiring or designating its \ninsurer to provide free access to abortifacient drugs. \n166.  From Wheaton’s perspective, there is little difference between forcing its \ninsurance issuer to provide free access to abortifacient drugs and directly providing that access. \n167.  Wheaton’s religious convictions forbid it from participating in any way in the \ngovernment’s scheme to promote and provide free access to abortifacient drugs through \nWheaton’s health care plans. \n168.  Wheaton is not eligible for the religious employers exemption because it is not an \norganization “described in section 6033(a)(1) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 46626. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  27 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 28 of 48 PageID #:28\n169.  Because Wheaton is unable to comply with the Final Mandate as a result of its \nreligious beliefs, and because it is unable to force its insurer to carry out the Final Mandate by \nsubmitting a self-certification, it faces crippling fines of $100 each day, for “each individual to \nwhom such failure relates.” 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b)(1). \n170.  Dropping its insurance plans would unfairly and severely burden Wheaton’s \nemployees and students, and would place Wheaton at a severe competitive disadvantage in its \nefforts to recruit and retain employees and students. \n171.  Wheaton would also face fines of $2000 per year for each of its employees for \ndropping its insurance plans. \n172.  Although the government has recently announced that it will postpone \nimplementing the annual fine of $2000 per employee for organizations that drop their insurance \naltogether, the postponement is only for one year, until 2015. This postponement does not delay \nthe crippling daily fines under 26 U.S.C. § 4980D. \n173.  Wheaton’s Christian faith compels it to promote the spiritual and physical well-\nbeing of its students and employees by providing them with generous health services. \n174.  The Final Mandate forces Wheaton to violate its religious beliefs or incur \nsubstantial fines for either excluding objectionable coverage without forcing its insurance issuer \nto provide the same coverage, or terminating its employee and student health insurance coverage \naltogether. \n175.  The Final Mandate forces Wheaton to deliberately provide health insurance that \nwould facilitate free access to abortifacient drugs regardless of the ability of insured persons to \nobtain these drugs and services from other sources. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  28 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 29 of 48 PageID #:29\n176.  The Final Mandate forces Wheaton to facilitate government-dictated education \nand counseling concerning abortion-causing drugs that are incompatible with its religious beliefs \nand teachings. \n177.  Facilitating this government-dictated speech is incompatible and irreconcilable \nwith the express speech and messages concerning the sanctity of life that Wheaton seeks to \nconvey. \nThe Lack of a Compelling Government Interest \n178.  The government lacks any compelling interest in coercing Wheaton to facilitate \naccess to abortifacient drugs. \n179.  The required abortifacient drugs are already widely available at non-prohibitive \ncosts. \n180.  There are multiple ways in which the government could provide access without \nco-opting religious employers and their insurance plans in violation of their religious beliefs. \n181.  For example, the government could pay for the objectionable services through its \nexisting network of family planning services funded under Title X, through direct government \npayments, or through tax deductions, refunds, or credits. \n182.  The government could also simply exempt all religious organizations, just as it \nhas already exempted nonprofit religious employers referred to in Section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or \n(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n183.  HHS claims that its “religious employers” exemption does not undermine its \ncompelling interest in making abortifacient services available for free to women because “houses \nof worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious \ngrounds are more likely than other employers to employ people who are of the same faith and/or \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  29 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 30 of 48 PageID #:30\nadhere to the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other people to use \ncontraceptive services even if such services were covered under their plan.” 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39887. \n184.  Wheaton’s employees and students commit to further its mission of serving \n“Christ and his kingdom,” and its students and faculty members voluntarily sign its community \ncovenant, which affirms their shared commitment to “uphold the God-given worth of human \nbeings, from conception to death, as the unique image-bearers of God (Gen. 1:27; Psalm 8:3-8; \n139:13-16).”  \n185.  Because of Wheaton’s religious obligation under its Community Covenant to \nproclaim Christian teaching regarding the sanctity of life, the students and employees that have \nchosen to join the Wheaton community are just as likely as employees of exempt organizations \nto adhere to the same values, and thus are less likely than other people to use the objectionable \ndrugs. \n186.  In one form or another, the government also provides exemptions for (1) \ngrandfathered plans, 42 U.S.C. § 18011; 75 Fed. Reg. 41726, 41731 (2010); (2) small employers \nwith fewer than 50 employees, 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2)(A); and (3) certain religious \ndenominations, 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii) (individual mandate does not apply to \nmembers of “recognized religious sect or division” that conscientiously objects to acceptance of \npublic or private insurance funds); 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(d)(2)(b)(ii) (individual mandate does not \napply to members of “health care sharing ministry” that meets certain criteria). \n187.  These broad exemptions further demonstrate that the government has no \ncompelling interest in refusing to include religious organizations like Wheaton within its \nreligious employers exemption. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  30 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 31 of 48 PageID #:31\n188.  Employers who follow HHS guidelines may continue to use grandfathered plans \nindefinitely. \n189.  Indeed, HHS has predicted that a majority of large employers, employing more \nthan 50 million Americans, will continue to use grandfathered plans through at least 2014, and \nthat a third of medium-sized employers with between 50 and 100 employees may do likewise. 75 \nFed. Reg. 34538 (published June 17, 2010).10  \n190.  According to the administration, 96% of American employers are exempt from \nthe employer mandate because they employ fewer than 50 people.11 \n191.  The government’s recent decision to postpone the mandatory insurance \nrequirement of the Affordable Care Act—i.e., the annual fine of $2000 per employee for not \noffering any insurance—also demonstrates that there is no compelling interest in coercing \nuniversal compliance with the Final Mandate concerning contraceptive and abortifacient \nservices, since employers can now simply drop their insurance without any penalty, at least for \none additional year. \n192.  These broad exemptions also demonstrate that the Final Mandate is not a \ngenerally applicable law entitled to judicial deference, but rather is constitutionally flawed.  \n193.  The government’s willingness to exempt various secular organizations and \npostpone the employer mandate, while adamantly refusing to provide anything but the narrowest \n                                                 \n10 See also Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Amendment to Regulation on \n“Grandfathered” Health Plans under the Affordable Care Act, https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/ \nResources/Files/factsheet_grandfather_amendment.html (noting that amendment to regulations “will \nresult in a small increase in the number of plans retaining their grandfathered status relative to the \nestimates made in the grandfathering regulation”) (last visited Dec. 2, 2013) (Ex.

Indeed, the Final Mandate was promulgated by government officials, and \nsupported by non-governmental organizations, who strongly oppose Wheaton’s religious \nteachings and beliefs regarding marriage and family. \n195.  Defendant Sebelius, for example, has long been a staunch supporter of abortion \nrights and a vocal critic of religious teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and contraception. \n196.  On October 5, 2011, six days after the comment period for the original interim \nfinal rule ended, Defendant Sebelius gave a speech at a fundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice \nAmerica. She told the assembled crowd that “we are in a war.”12 \n197.  On July 16, 2013, Secretary Sebelius further compared opponents of the \nAffordable Care Act generally to people who opposed civil rights legislation in the 1960s, stating \nthat upholding the Act requires the same action as was shown “in the fight against lynching and \nthe fight for desegregation.”13  \n198.  Consequently, on information and belief, Wheaton alleges that the purpose of the \nFinal Mandate, including the restrictively narrow scope of the religious employers exemption, is \nto discriminate against religious organizations that oppose abortion. \n                                                 \n12 William McGurn, The Church of Kathleen Sebelius, Wall St. J., Dec. 13, 2011, available at \nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/ SB10001424052970203518404577094631979925326 (Ex.

Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n200.  Wheaton’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from deliberately providing \nhealth insurance that would facilitate access to abortifacients, or to related education and \ncounseling. Wheaton’s compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. \n201.  The Final Mandate creates government-imposed coercive pressure on Wheaton to \nchange or violate its religious beliefs. \n202.  The Final Mandate chills Wheaton’s religious exercise. \n203.  The Final Mandate exposes Wheaton to substantial fines for its religious exercise. \n204.

Wheaton’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from deliberately providing \nhealth insurance that would facilitate access to abortifacients, or to related education and \ncounseling. Wheaton’s compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. \n213.  Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Final Mandate is neutral. \n214.  Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Final Mandate is generally applicable. \n215.  Defendants have created categorical exemptions and individualized exemptions to \nthe Final Mandate. \n216.  The Final Mandate furthers no compelling governmental interest. \n217.  The Final Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ \nstated interests. \n218.

The Final Mandate is not narrowly tailored to any compelling governmental \ninterest. \n224.  The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate \nviolate Wheaton’s rights secured to it by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution.  \n225.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nIntentional Discrimination \n \n226.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n227.  Wheaton’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from deliberately providing \nhealth insurance that would facilitate access to abortifacients, or to related education and \ncounseling. Wheaton’s compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise. \n228.  Despite being informed in detail of these beliefs beforehand, Defendants designed \nthe Final Mandate and the religious employer exemption to the Final Mandate to target religious \norganizations like Wheaton because of their religious beliefs. \n229.  Defendants promulgated both the Final Mandate and its religious employer \nexemption in order to suppress the religious exercise of Wheaton and others. \n230.  The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate \nthus violate Wheaton’s rights secured to it by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment \nof the United States Constitution.  \n231.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  35 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 36 of 48 PageID #:36\nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise and Establishment Clauses \nDiscrimination Among Religions and Religious Institutions \n \n232.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n233.  The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause of the First Amendment \nmandate the equal treatment of all religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or \npreference. \n234.  This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n235.  The Final Mandate’s narrow exemption for “religious employers” but not others \ndiscriminates among religions and religious institutions on the basis of religious views or \nreligious status. \n236.  The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate \nthus violate Wheaton’s rights secured to it by the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  \n237.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT V \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nSelective Burden (Larson v. Valente) \n \n238.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n239.  By design, Defendants imposed the Final Mandate on some religious \norganizations but not on others, resulting in a selective burden on Wheaton. \n240.  The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate \ntherefore violate Wheaton’s rights secured to it by the First Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  36 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 37 of 48 PageID #:37\n241.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \n242.  The Final Mandate vests HRSA with unbridled discretion in deciding whether to \nallow exemptions to some, all, or no organizations meeting the definition of “religious \nemployers.” \nCOUNT VI \n \nInterference in Matters of Internal Religious Governance \nFree Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause \n \n243.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n244.  The Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause protect the freedom of \nreligious organizations to decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of internal \ngovernance as well as those of faith and doctrine. \n245.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decisions concerning the organization’s religious structure, leadership, or \ndoctrine. \n246.  Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious \norganization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the \norganization itself. \n247.  Wheaton has made an internal decision, dictated by its Christian faith, that any \nhealth plans it makes available to its employees and students may not subsidize, provide, or \nfacilitate access to abortifacient drugs or related services. \n248.  The Final Mandate interferes with Wheaton’s internal decisions concerning its \nstructure and mission by requiring it to subsidize, provide, and facilitate practices that directly \nconflict with its Christian beliefs. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  37 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 38 of 48 PageID #:38\n249.  The Final Mandate’s interference with Wheaton’s internal decisions affects its \nfaith and mission by requiring it to subsidize, provide, and facilitate practices that directly \nconflict with its religious beliefs. \n250.  Because the Final Mandate interferes with Wheaton’s internal decision making in \na manner that affects its faith and mission, it violates the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise \nClause of the First Amendment. \n251.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed.   \nCOUNT VII \nReligious Discrimination \nViolation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nEstablishment Clause and Due Process \n \n252.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n253.  By design, Defendants imposed the Final Mandate on some religious \norganizations but not on others, resulting in discrimination among religious objectors. \n254.  Religious liberty is a fundamental right. \n255.  The “religious employer” exemption protects many religious objectors, but not \nWheaton. \n256.  The “accommodation” provides no meaningful protection for Wheaton. \n257.  The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate \ntherefore violate Wheaton’s rights secured to it by the Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \n258.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  38 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 39 of 48 PageID #:39\nCOUNT VIII \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nDue Process and Equal Protection \n \n259.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n260.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment mandates the equal treatment of \nall religious faiths and institutions without discrimination or preference. \n261.  This mandate of equal treatment protects organizations as well as individuals. \n262.  The Final Mandate’s narrow exemption for “religious employers” but not others \ndiscriminates among religions on the basis of religious views or religious status. \n263.  The Final Mandate and Defendants’ threatened enforcement of the Final Mandate \nthus violate Wheaton’s rights secured to it by the Fifth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution.  \n264.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT IX \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech \nCompelled Speech and Compelled Silence \n \n265.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n266.  Wheaton teaches that abortion and contraception that interferes with the survival \nof a human embryo violate its religious beliefs. \n267.  The Final Mandate would compel Wheaton to subsidize activities that Wheaton \nteaches are violations of its religious beliefs. \n268.  The Final Mandate would compel Wheaton to provide education and counseling \nrelated to abortifacients. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  39 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 40 of 48 PageID #:40\n269.  Defendants’ actions thus violate Wheaton’s right to be free from compelled \nspeech as secured to it by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n270.  The Final Mandate also prevents Wheaton from speaking to its third-party \nadministrator about its religious beliefs and preference that the administrator not provide the \nservices at issue. \n271.  The Final Mandate’s speech restrictions are not narrowly tailored to a compelling \ngovernmental interest. \n272.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed.    \nCOUNT X \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFreedom of Speech \nExpressive Association \n \n273.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n274.  Wheaton teaches that contraception, sterilization, and abortion violate its religious \nbeliefs.  \n275.  The Final Mandate would compel Wheaton to facilitate activities that Wheaton \nteaches are violations of its religious beliefs. \n276.  The Final Mandate would compel Wheaton to facilitate access to government-\ndictated education and counseling related to abortifacients. \n277.  Defendants’ actions thus violate Wheaton’s right of expressive association as \nsecured to it by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n278.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed.   \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  40 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 41 of 48 PageID #:41\nCOUNT XI \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause and Freedom of Speech \nUnbridled Discretion \n \n279.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n280.  By stating that HRSA “may” grant an exemption to certain religious groups, the \nFinal Mandate vests HRSA with unbridled discretion over which organizations can have its First \nAmendment interests accommodated. \n281.  Defendants have exercised unbridled discretion in a discriminatory manner by \ngranting an exemption via footnote in a website for a narrowly defined group of “religious \nemployers” but not for other religious organizations like Wheaton. \n282.  Defendants have further exercised unbridled discretion by indiscriminately \nwaiving enforcement of some provisions of the Affordable Care Act while refusing to waive \nenforcement of the Final Mandate, despite its conflict with the free exercise of religion. \n283.  Defendants’ actions therefore violate Wheaton’s right not to be subjected to a \nsystem of unbridled discretion when engaging in speech or when engaging in religious exercise, \nas secured to it by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.    \n284.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XII \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nLack of Good Cause, Failure to Follow Notice and  \nComment Rulemaking, and Improper Delegation \n \n285.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  41 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 42 of 48 PageID #:42\n286.  The Affordable Care Act expressly delegates to HRSA, an agency within \nDefendant HHS, the authority to establish guidelines concerning the “preventive care” that a \ngroup health plan and health insurance issuer must provide. \n287.  Given this express delegation, Defendants were required to engage in formal \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law before issuing the guidelines \nwith which group health plans and insurers must comply. Proposed regulations were required to \nbe published in the Federal Register and interested persons were required to be given an \nopportunity to participate in the rulemaking through the submission of written data, views, or \narguments. \n288.  Defendants promulgated the “preventive care” guidelines without engaging in \nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking in a manner prescribed by law. Defendants, instead, \nwholly delegated their responsibilities for issuing preventive care guidelines to a non-\ngovernmental entity, the IOM.  \n289.  The IOM did not permit or provide for the broad public comment otherwise \nrequired under the APA concerning the guidelines that it would recommend. The dissent to the \nIOM report noted both that the IOM conducted its review in an unacceptably short time frame, \nand that the review process lacked transparency. \n290.  Within two weeks of the IOM issuing its guidelines, Defendant HHS issued a \npress release announcing that the IOM’s guidelines were required under the Affordable Care Act. \n291.  Defendants have never explained why they failed to enact these “preventive care” \nguidelines through notice-and-comment rulemaking as required by the APA. \n292.  Defendants’ stated reasons that public comments were unnecessary, impractical, \nand opposed to the public interest are false and insufficient, and do not constitute “good cause.”  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  42 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 43 of 48 PageID #:43\n293.  Without proper notice and opportunity for public comment, Defendants were \nunable to take into account the full implications of the regulations by completing a meaningful \n“consideration of the relevant matter presented.” This failure prejudiced Wheaton.  \n294.  Defendants did not consider or respond to the voluminous comments they \nreceived in opposition to the interim final rule or the NPRM.  \n295.  Therefore, Defendants have taken agency action not in observance with \nprocedures required by law, and Wheaton is entitled to relief pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n296.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed. \nCOUNT XIII \n \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nArbitrary and Capricious Action \n \n297.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n298.  In promulgating the Final Mandate, Defendants failed to consider the \nconstitutional and statutory implications of the Final Mandate on Wheaton and similar \norganizations. \n299.  Defendants’ explanation for its decision not to exempt Wheaton and similar \nreligious organizations from the Final Mandate runs counter to the evidence submitted by \nreligious organizations during the comment period.  \n300.  Defendant Secretary Sebelius, in remarks made at Harvard University on April 8, \n2013, essentially conceded that Defendants completely disregarded the religious liberty concerns \nsubmitted by thousands of religious organizations and individuals. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  43 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 44 of 48 PageID #:44\n301.  Thus, Defendants’ issuance of the interim final rule was arbitrary and capricious \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) because the rules fail to consider the full extent of \ntheir implications and they do not take into consideration the evidence against them. \n302.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Final Mandate, Wheaton has \nbeen and will continue to be harmed.  \nCOUNT XIV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \nAgency Action Without Statutory Authority \n \n303.  Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n304.  Defendants’ authority to enact regulations under the Affordable Care Act is \nlimited to the authority expressly granted them by Congress. \n305.  Defendants lack statutory authority to coerce insurance issuers and third party \nadministrators to pay for contraceptive and abortifacient services for individuals with whom they \nhave no contractual or fiduciary relationship. \n306.  Defendants lack statutory authority to prevent insurance issuers and third party \nadministrators from passing on the costs of providing contraceptive and abortifacient services via \nhigher premiums or other charges that are not “cost sharing.” \n307.  Defendants lack statutory authority to allow user fees from the federal exchanges \nto be used to purchase contraceptive and abortifacient services for employees not participating in \nthe exchanges.  \n308.  Because the Final Mandate’s “accommodation” for non-exempt, nonprofit \nreligious organizations lacks legal authority, it is arbitrary and capricious and provides no \nlegitimate protection of objecting organization’s First Amendment rights.  \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  44 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 45 of 48 PageID #:45\n309.

Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n311.  The Final Mandate is contrary to the provisions of the Weldon Amendment of the \nConsolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act of 2009, Pub. L. \n110-117, 123 Stat. 3034 (Dec. 16, 2009).14 \n312.  The Weldon Amendment provides that “[n]one of the funds made available in this \nAct [making appropriations for Defendants Department of Labor and Health and Human \nServices] may be made available to a Federal agency or program . . . if such agency, program, or \ngovernment subjects any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination on the \nbasis that the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for \nabortions.” \n313.  The Final Mandate requires issuers, including Wheaton, to deliberately provide \nhealth insurance that facilitates access to all Federal Drug Administration-approved \ncontraceptives. \n314.  Some FDA-approved contraceptives cause abortions. \n315.  As set forth above, the Final Mandate violates RFRA and the First Amendment. \n                                                 \n14 Available at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/ConscienceProtect/ \npublaw111_117_123_stat_3034.pdf (Ex.

Wheaton incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  \n319.  The Final Mandate is contrary to the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.  \n320.  Section 1303 of the Affordable Care Act states that “nothing in this title”—i.e., \ntitle I of the Act, which includes the provision dealing with “preventive services”—“shall be \nconstrued to require a qualified health plan to provide coverage of [abortion] services . . . as part \nof its essential health benefits for any plan year.” \n321.  Section 1303 further states that it is “the issuer” of a plan that “shall determine \nwhether or not the plan provides coverage” of abortion services.  \n322.  Under the Affordable Care Act, Defendants do not have the authority to decide \nwhether a plan covers abortion; only the issuer does. \n323.  The Final Mandate requires group health plans to provide coverage of all Federal \nDrug Administration-approved contraceptives. \n324.  The Final Mandate requires third-party administrators, like Wheaton’s, to provide \nor contract to provide coverage of all Federal Drug Administration-approved contraceptives. \n325.  Some FDA-approved contraceptives cause abortions. \nCH01DOCS\\257406.2  46 \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 1 Filed: 12/13/13 Page 47 of 48 PageID #:47\n326.

Wheaton College is a liberal arts \ncollege in Illinois that although not owned by or affiliated \nwith any church (in other words, it is nondenominational) is \ndeeply  committed  to  evangelical  Protestantism.  Although \nWheaton hires faculty and staff from a variety of Christian \ntraditions, and admits students of varied faiths, it requires \nall members of the college community, which is to say all \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n2  No. 14-2396 \nemployees and all students, to sign a “Community Cove-\nnant” that among other things requires them to “uphold the \nGod-given  worth  of  human  beings,  from  conception  to \ndeath.” (Despite the centrality of the covenant to the col-\nlege’s argument, its lawyers did not bother to include it in \nthe appellate record. We found it online, at Wheaton Col-\nlege,  “Community  Covenant,”  www.wheaton.edu/about-\nwheaton/community-covenant  (visited  June  17,  2015,  as \nwere the other websites cited in this opinion).) The Covenant \ndoes not mention contraception, but the passage we quoted \nimplies, and Wheaton believes, that what is called “emer-\ngency contraception,” which means contraception after in-\ntercourse, is forbidden on religious grounds if it can destroy \na fertilized ovum. Wheaton also opposes intrauterine devic-\nes (IUDs) that whether inserted before or after intercourse \nmay prevent the implantation of a fertilized ovum. The col-\nlege  implements  its  belief  about  emergency  contraception \nand IUDs by excluding coverage of them from its health \nplans. \nContraception that prevents fertilization rather than de-\nstroying a fertilized ovum is referred to by the college as \n“traditional contraception,” and the college has made clear \nthat it does not oppose such contraception. Of the 20 types of \nfemale contraceptive approved by the Food and Drug Ad-\nministration  the  college  disapproves  only  emergency-\ncontraceptive drugs and certain IUDs. \nThe college brought this suit against the federal govern-\nment complaining that the Affordable Care Act is infringing \nits religious rights—in violation of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1, as well as the First \nAmendment—by  making  it  complicit  in  the  provision  of \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  3 \nemergency-contraceptive coverage to its employees and stu-\ndents. The suit is pending in the district court; before us is \nthe college’s appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunc-\ntion. \nThe  Introduction  to  the  college’s  opening  brief  begins \nwith the following inaccurate statement: “This case arises \nfrom  the  government’s  effort  to  use  Wheaton  College’s \nhealth plans to distribute emergency contraceptive drugs.” \nAnd the first sentence of the reply brief states in like vein \nthat “Wheaton has benefit plans, and the government wants \nto use them.” At oral argument the college’s lawyer insisted \nthat  the  government  was  “using  our  plan”  and  “putting \n[additional terms] into our contract.” If Wheaton College is \nwrong, and the government is not trying to “use” the col-\nlege’s health plans to provide insurance coverage for emer-\ngency contraceptives (of which the best known are “morning \nafter” pills), or to add terms to those plans, the college has \nno case. This point is underscored by the fact that the only \narticulated relief it seeks in this court is a “remand with an \ninjunction [we assume the college means a preliminary in-\njunction]  prohibiting  the  government’s  efforts  to  use \nWheaton’s plans.” True, it says it also wants “an injunction \nagainst the government during the pendency of this appeal \nrequiring it to treat Wheaton as an exempt ‘religious em-\nployer’” (it means an injunction requiring such treatment, \nnot an injunction against the government’s requiring such \ntreatment); but at the oral argument the college’s lawyer in-\ndicated that the college’s only objection is to the govern-\nment’s “using” Wheaton’s health plans to get around the \ncollege’s  objection  to  emergency  contraception.  Actually \nthere  are  no  efforts  by  the  government  to  take  over \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n4  No. 14-2396 \nWheaton’s health plans, as Wheaton contends. Acts cannot \nbe enjoined that are neither actuality nor threat. \nThe contraception provisions of the federal Act and its \nimplementing regulations do not alter or annex college or \nother institutional health plans that fail to provide coverage \nfor some or all contraceptives. In the case of religious objec-\ntors to such coverage, the Act requires providers of health \ninsurance (to the objectors’ staff, students, etc., and third-\nparty administrators, which usually are also insurance com-\npanies) to cover certain preventive services without cost to \nthe insured. The services include “all Food and Drug Ad-\nministration  approved  contraceptive  methods.”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13(a)(4);  45  C.F.R.  § 147.130(a)(1)(iv);  Health  Re-\nsources  &  Services  Administration,  “Women’s  Preventive \nServices  Guidelines,”  www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines. \nThe college does not challenge the government’s authority to \nrequire that all approved methods of contraception be avail-\nable to women at no cost to them. What it challenges is the \nrequirement that it notify its insurers or the government that \nit is claiming a religious exemption and that it give the gov-\nernment the insurers’ names so that the government can di-\nrect the insurers to provide emergency-contraception cover-\nage. \nWe  should  note  that  in  its  May  2014  response  to  the \n“Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material Facts,” the gov-\nernment emphatically denied that it has approved any abor-\ntifacient contraceptive; it said that “no FDA-approved con-\ntraceptive methods cause the demise of an early embryo as \npart of their mechanism of action.” True, the government \ndefines abortion as the termination of a pregnancy, and de-\nfines pregnancy as (beginning) the moment an embryo is \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  5 \nimplanted in the wall of the uterus (see 45 C.F.R. § 46.202(f)), \nwhereas Wheaton defines “conception,” which it regards as \nthe first stage in a pregnancy, as the creation of a fertilized \novum. It takes about five or six days for a fertilized ovum to \ntravel down a fallopian tube and begin the process of im-\nplantation  in  the  uterine  wall.  See  UCSF Medical  Center, \n“Conception:  How  it  Works,”  www.ucsfhealth.org/educa\ntion/conception_how_it_works/.  Wheaton  considers  any \ndrug that kills the fertilized ovum by preventing implanta-\ntion to be an abortifacient. \nThe FDA’s “Birth Control Guide” says in apparent con-\nformity with Wheaton College’s view that two emergency \ncontraceptives, Plan B and ella, may prevent implantation of \na fertilized egg. The government has not disputed (which is \nnot to say that it necessarily accepts) this view, but scientific \nstudies dispute it. According to The Emergency Contraception \nWebsite  (operated  by  the  Office  of  Population  Control  of \nPrinceton University and the Association of Reproductive \nHealth Professionals), “How Does Emergency Contraception \nPrevent Pregnancy?,” http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ecw\nork.html, “There is no evidence to suggest that either of the \nFDA-approved emergency contraceptive options, levonorg-\nestrel (LNG, such as Plan B One-Step, Take Action, Next Choice \nOne Dose or My Way) or ulipristal acetate (UPA, such as ella) \nworks after an egg is fertilized.” See also James  Trussell, \nElizabeth G. Raymond, and Kelly Cleland, “Emergency Con-\ntraception: A Last Chance to Prevent Unintended Pregnan-\ncy,”  http://ec.princeton.edu/questions/ec-review.pdf.  For  a \nlucid review of the scientific evidence, see Pam Belluck, “No \nAbortion Role Seen for Morning-After Pill,” New York Times, \nJune 6, 2012, p. A1. Asked about this at oral argument, how-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n6  No. 14-2396 \never, Wheaton College’s lawyer acknowledged ignorance of \nthe scientific literature. \nWhether emergency contraceptives prevent implantation \nis relevant to whether Wheaton has any religious basis for \nopposing them, given its acceptance of what it calls tradi-\ntional contraception, but does not affect the outcome of this \nappeal.  The government, while it denies that the emergency \ncontraceptives approved by the FDA and hence subject to \nthe  contraception-coverage  provisions  of  the  Affordable \nCare  Act  are  abortifacients,  has  not  made  an  issue  of \nWheaton’s religious sincerity.  Moreover, the scientific litera-\nture does not challenge the capacity of IUDs to prevent im-\nplantation, so Wheaton’s religious objection to those devices, \nat least, is not affected by scientific controversy. \nAs explained in too many cases to warrant citation, the \nAffordable Care Act requires college health insurance plans \n(including  plans  in  which  an  insurance  company  merely \nadministers a plan insured by the college itself and is there-\nfore a third-party administrator rather an insurer) to cover \nthe 20 types of FDA-approved contraceptives. But a college \ncan refuse to include in its health plans coverage of drugs of \nwhich it disapproves on sincere religious grounds. To exer-\ncise this right of refusal the college has only to notify its \nhealth insurers, or if it prefers the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, of its unwillingness to provide coverage. \nThe insurers are then obligated by the Affordable Care Act \nto provide the coverage directly to requesting students, fac-\nulty, and staff. The college and its health plans are thus by-\npassed. \nSo  when  Wheaton  College  tells  us  that  it  is  being \n“forced” to allow “use” of its health plans to cover emergen-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  7 \ncy contraceptives, it is wrong. It’s being “forced” only to no-\ntify  its  insurers  (including  third-party  administrators), \nwhether directly or by notifying the government (which will \nforward the notification to the insurers), that it will not use \nits health plans to cover emergency contraception, that it is \nout of the loop, that the insurers will have to deal directly \nwith the students, faculty, and staff, bypassing the college \nhealth plans, which remain in force, so far as contraceptive \ncoverage is concerned, only for the contraceptives that the \ncollege does not disapprove of on religious grounds. The col-\nlege doesn’t even have to inform the insurers of their obliga-\ntion to provide coverage; the government as we said does \nthat if the college has told the government that it refuses to \nprovide the coverage. \nOnce informed by the government of the college’s objec-\ntion, the insurers are required by the Affordable Care Act \nand implementing regulations to notify the members of the \ncollege community of their right to coverage by the insurers. \nIn deference to religious sensibilities the government directs \nthe insurers to separate notification to the community mem-\nbers from the insurers’ communications with them concern-\ning the college’s health plans, and to include a statement that \nthe college is not funding or administering contraceptive (in \nWheaton’s case just emergency-contraceptive) coverage. 29 \nC.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(d); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(d). Call this \n“using”  the  health  plans?  We  call  it  refusing  to  use  the \nhealth plans. \nThe upshot is that the college contracts with health insur-\ners  for  contraceptive  coverage  exclusive  of  coverage  for \nemergency  contraceptives,  and  the  Department  of  Health \nand Human Services contracts with those insurers to cover \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n8  No. 14-2396 \nemergency-contraceptive  benefits.  The  latter  contracts  are \nnot part of the college’s health plans, and so the college is \nmistaken when it tells us that the government is “interfer-\ning” with the college’s contracts with its insurers. The con-\ntracts, which do not require coverage of emergency contra-\nception, are unchanged. New contracts are created, to which \nthe college is not a party, between the government and the \ninsurers. \nAfter the district court denied the preliminary injunction \nsought by Wheaton College and we denied a temporary in-\njunction pending appeal, the college sought relief from the \nSupreme Court. In a brief per curiam order the Court said \nthat if the college notified the Department of Health and \nHuman  Services  in  writing  of  its  religious  objection  to \nproviding coverage for certain types of contraceptives, the \nDepartment could rely on the notice “to facilitate the provi-\nsion of full contraceptive coverage under the Act”—in other \nwords, to notify the insurers that they would be obligated to \nprovide, to the members of the Wheaton College communi-\nty, “without cost, the full range of FDA approved contracep-\ntives.” Wheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014). The \nDepartment notifies the insurers of their obligation to pro-\nvide contraceptive coverage in the college’s stead without \ncost to, or any involvement of, the college. \nThe college argues that it remains involuntarily complicit \nin the provision of emergency contraception because its noti-\nfication to the Department that it objects to the provision of \ncontraception on religious grounds serves as the “trigger” of \nthe Department’s ordering the insurers to cover emergency \ncontraception. It says as the trigger-puller or facilitator the \ncollege shares responsibility for the extension of such cover-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  9 \nage to its students, faculty, and staff. That also is incorrect. \nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurers to provide cover-\nage for FDA-approved emergency as well as traditional con-\ntraception to Wheaton’s students and employees, and to pick \nup the tab for that coverage (which the government reim-\nburses)  should  Wheaton  decide  to  opt  out  of  paying  for \nemergency-contraception coverage on religious grounds. As \nwe explained in University of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d \n606, 614–15 (7th Cir. 2015), it is the law, not any action on the \npart of the college, that obligates insurers “to pick up the ball \nif [the college] decides, as is its right, to drop it. [The col-\nlege’s notification to the government] no more ‘triggers’ [the \ninsurer’s] obligation to provide contraceptive services than a \ntortfeasor’s  declaring  bankruptcy  ‘triggers’  his  co-\ntortfeasors’ joint and several liability for damages. [The in-\nsurer] must provide the services no matter what; [by notify-\ning the government, the college] simply shifts the financial \nburden from the university to the government, as desired by \nthe university.” Wheaton College does not want to be in-\nvolved in the provision of emergency contraceptives; pursu-\nant to its wishes, it no longer is involved. \nIt doesn’t claim any right to prevent its students or em-\nployees  (not  to  mention  dependents  of  those  employees, \nwho are also covered by Wheaton’s health plans) from ob-\ntaining access to emergency contraceptives covered by the \nAffordable Care Act. But it seeks to make that access diffi-\ncult. For supposing that the college has no obligation to noti-\nfy the government or the insurers that it doesn’t want to \ncover  emergency  contraception,  how  are  the  government \nand the insurers to find this out? Are they required to inves-\ntigate every college? All that the government requires of an \nopt out like Wheaton—and it isn’t much—is that  \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n10  No. 14-2396 \nWhen a notice is provided to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, the notice must include the name \nof the eligible organization and the basis on which it \nqualifies for an accommodation; its objection based on \nsincerely held religious beliefs to coverage of some or \nall contraceptive services (including an identification of \nthe subset of contraceptive services to which coverage \nthe eligible organization objects, if applicable); the plan \nname and type (i.e., whether it is a student health in-\nsurance plan within the meaning of 45 CFR 147.145(a) \nor a church plan within the meaning of ERISA section \n3(33)); and the name and contact information for any  \nof the plan’s third party administrators and health in-\nsurance issuers. If there is a change in any of the in-\nformation required to be included in the notice, the or-\nganization must provide updated information to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. The Depart-\nment of Labor (working with the Department of Health \nand Human Services), shall send a separate notification \nto each of the plan’s third party administrators inform-\ning the third party administrator that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has received a notice un-\nder paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and describing \nthe obligations of the third party administrator under \n§ 2510.3–16 of this chapter and this section. \n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(ii)(B). This is hardly a burden-\nsome requirement; nor does it leave the provider—the opt \nout—with  any  residual  involvement  in  the  coverage  of \ndrugs or devices of which it sincerely disapproves on reli-\ngious grounds. \nAt oral argument Wheaton College’s lawyer told us that \nthe college does not object to having to inform the Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services that it is a religious in-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  11 \nstitution unwilling to provide emergency-contraception cov-\nerage, but that it does object to identifying its health insurers \nto the government. It claims the right to tell the government \nno more than that “we’re Wheaton College and we object to \ncoverage of emergency contraception for our students or our \nemployees and by the way we won’t give you the names of \nour students or employees or insurers to make it easier for \nyou to arrange alternative coverage for such contraception.” \nThe government could, though at some expense, discover \nwho they were without being told by Wheaton. Would that \nsatisfy Wheaton? It hasn’t told us, but we suspect not, be-\ncause in Wheaton’s view its notice to the government would \nstill “trigger” the provision of emergency-contraception to \nits students and employees by its insurers, albeit not pursu-\nant to its contracts with them. Wheaton’s antipathy is to hav-\ning  any  contractual  relations  with  insurers  who  provide \nemergency contraception to members of the Wheaton Col-\nlege community. Because they are “its” insurers, someone \nnot in the know might think it “complicit” in the insurers’ \nprovision of a type of coverage that offends Wheaton’s reli-\ngious views. But where’s the complicity? \nEven with a strong case Wheaton could not obtain an in-\njunction against the insurers when it hasn’t named them as \ndefendants in its complaint. They now have a contract with \nthe government obliging them to insure the members of the \nWheaton community for emergency contraception. The con-\ntract provides them with generous reimbursement. See Uni-\nversity of Notre Dame v. Burwell, supra, 786 F.3d at 613. We \ndon’t know what the contracts’ duration is or whether or in \nwhat circumstances they are terminable by Wheaton College \nbefore their expiration date. All that is clear is that the insur-\ners have an interest in this case yet have not been made par-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n12  No. 14-2396 \nties. In any event, termination of the contracts would give \nWheaton only temporary relief, since the government would \nnotify any new insurers hired by Wheaton of their legal ob-\nligation to provide emergency-contraceptive coverage. \nAt oral argument Wheaton’s lawyer said that his client \nhas no objection to the government’s using the college’s in-\nsurers to provide emergency-contraceptive coverage as long \nas it’s not “using” Wheaton’s contract with the insurers or \nrequiring them to provide contraceptives to Wheaton’s stu-\ndents because Wheaton has chosen to opt out. The two condi-\ntions are inconsistent; it’s because Wheaton has opted out that \nthe government is ordering the insurers to provide coverage \nin  lieu  of  Wheaton  rather  than  to  continue  insuring \nWheaton. The first condition, standing alone, would imply \nthat if the government had a contract with an insurer to pro-\nvide  emergency-contraception  coverage  to  all  college  stu-\ndents, or to all college students who sought coverage be-\ncause they were not getting it through their university plans, \nWheaton would be content. (We wonder.) \nWe can’t order the U.S. government not to ask particular \ninsurers  to  insure  Wheaton’s  students  and  employees—\nespecially the insurers that are experienced in dealing with \nthe members of the Wheaton community. As for Wheaton’s \napparent preference that the government discover through \nits own research the names of Wheaton’s insurers, we cannot \nimagine that insistence on this roundabout path to imparting \nessential information to the government could justify a pre-\nliminary injunction, at least in the absence of any explana-\ntion by Wheaton of why it thinks the difference between di-\nrect and roundabout identification of its insurers pertinent to \nits religious commitments.  \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  13 \n Wheaton’s complaint, which it has never tried to amend, \nwas filed back in 2013 and sought relief only against having \nto opt out of emergency-contraception coverage by notifying \nthe insurers. That was the only method of opting out author-\nized by federal law at the time. The alternative of being al-\nlowed to notify the government instead of the insurers came \nlater. The college objects emphatically to that alternative as \nwell,  yet  hasn’t  indicated  how  it  thinks  the  government \nwould have learned of its objections had it not sued. It does \nargue that the government has alternatives to making the \ncollege’s  insurers  cover  emergency  contraception,  such  as \ntelling the students and employees to find their own insur-\nance through government-run health exchanges or arrang-\ning  coverage  itself  (maybe  by  creating  an  Emergency-\nContraception  Bureau  in  the  Department  of  Health  and \nHuman Services). But as we discussed in the Notre Dame \ncase, these alternatives would “involve cumbersome admin-\nistrative machinery and at the same time impose a burden \non [the college’s] female students and employees who want \nto obtain contraceptives.” 786 F.3d at 617. And we don’t un-\nderstand how a government program to provide contracep-\ntion directly to Wheaton’s students and employees would \nrelieve the college of its “complicity” in the provision of the \nforbidden contraceptives: “Were [the college] to hire an un-\nemployed person who, by virtue of becoming employed by \n[the college], obtained contraception coverage for the first \ntime, would not the university be ’triggering’ the new em-\nployee’s access to contraception?” Id.  \nWheaton relies on its Community Covenant, which we \nquoted from and which all students and employees are re-\nquired to sign, for the proposition that its students and em-\nployees share Wheaton’s belief about emergency contracep-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n14  No. 14-2396 \ntives and so the government has no interest in ensuring their \naccess  to  emergency-contraceptive  coverage.  Remember, \nhowever,  that  the  covenant  does  not  mention  emergency \ncontraception, or for that matter “traditional” contraception \n(which Wheaton does not disapprove); it states merely that \nthe covenant’s signers must “uphold the God-given worth of \nhuman beings, from conception to death.” Wheaton as we \nknow interprets this to prohibit the use of emergency con-\ntraceptives, but do all its students and employees interpret \nthis broad statement in the same way? Must they? And what \nabout the dependents of members of the college community? \nThey don’t have to sign the Community Covenant and may \nnot share Wheaton’s religious beliefs. We haven’t been told \nwhat happens to their coverage of emergency contraception \nif the college prevails in its suit.  \nIf the college is correct that the government has no real \nstake in the provision of such coverage to members of the \nWheaton College community because they’re all signers of \nthe covenant, this actually undermines its case, by suggest-\ning that its insurers are never asked to provide such cover-\nage to members of the college community, making the col-\nlege’s  complaints  academic.  Queried  at  oral  argument \nwhether  any  member  of  the  community  has  ever  been \nknown to violate any of the conditions in the Community \nCovenant, or been expelled or otherwise punished for such a \nviolation, Wheaton’s lawyer said he was unaware of any. \n(The  college’s  student  handbook,  59  pages  of  fine  print, \nwhich is not in the appellate record but is available online at \nwww.wheaton.edu/~/media/Files/Student-Life/StudentHand\nbook-2014-15.pdf, makes clear that students are required to \nadhere to the Community Covenant and describes a wide \nrange of sanctions, but the covenant does not mention con-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  15 \ntraceptives or contraception coverage.) If the implicit prohi-\nbition of emergency contraception is totally effective—and \nWheaton  College  has  presented  no  evidence,  or  even  al-\nleged, that it is not—the terms of its contracts with its insur-\ners are indeed academic. It’s as if the Affordable Care Act \nhad entitled sterile women to emergency contraceptives. \nThe college refers in its brief to a hypothetical “dissatis-\nfied Wheaton employee who wants” insurance coverage for \nemergency contraceptives. It doesn’t say there are any such \nemployees, however, and implies there are not; for it says \nthat “Wheaton’s employees and students choose to work at \nor attend Wheaton because they share its religious beliefs \nand  wish  to  help  Wheaton  further  its  mission.  Wheaton \nwould violate their implicit trust in the organization and \ndetrimentally alter its relationship with them if it were to vi-\nolate its religious beliefs regarding abortion.” No one is ask-\ning Wheaton to violate its religious beliefs. Besides, if such a \n“violation” would distress its staff and students, this implies \nthat they indeed adhere to the Community Covenant, and if \nso Wheaton College need have no fear that any of them will \never use the forbidden contraceptives. So far as we know it \nhas no such fear—its “dissatisfied” employee is a chimera. \nThe college tells us as we said that it has no objection \neven to universal coverage by the government of emergency \ncontraception. Yet as that would give the college’s students \nand employees access to the forbidden contraceptives free of \ncharge, the impact on Wheaton would be unaltered from \nwhat it is now. \nThe college advances secondary grounds for the relief \nthat it seeks. One is that the government is discriminating \nagainst the college because churches have been exempted \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n16  No. 14-2396 \nfrom the contraception provisions in the Affordable Care Act \nand therefore do not have to notify anyone of their unwill-\ningness  to  provide  their  employees  or  parishioners  with \ncoverage for contraception. Part of the relief it seeks is “re-\nquiring [the government] to treat Wheaton as an exempt ‘re-\nligious employer.’” But Wheaton College does not claim to \nbe a church, or explain how without some notification to the \ngovernment, or to its insurers, an organization that is not, \nlike a church, automatically exempt becomes known to the \ngovernment as having religious views that clash with, and \nentitle it to opt out of, the federal law. At oral argument we \nasked the college’s lawyer whether the college could incor-\nporate itself as a religious organization; he said he didn’t \nknow. \nWheaton further argues that requiring it to ask for an ex-\nemption and to provide the government with the name of its \ninsurer violates its First Amendment rights by compelling it \nto say something that it does not want to say. That would be \nthe equivalent of entitling a tax protester to refuse on First \nAmendment grounds to fill out a 1099 form and mail it to \nthe Internal Revenue Service. Wheaton remains free to voice \nits opposition to the use of emergency contraceptives. “Re-\nquiring Plaintiffs to give notice that they wish to opt out of \nthe  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  no  more  compels \ntheir speech in violation of the First Amendment than does \ndemanding  that  a  conscientious  objector  self-identify  as \nsuch.” Priests for Life v. U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, \n772 F.3d 229, 271 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  \nThe  college  argues  that  the  government  is  violating \nERISA  by  designating  a  third-party  administrator  of \nWheaton College’s health plans to be the plan administrator \n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\nNo. 14-2396  17 \nfor  coverage  of  emergency  contraception.  As  we  know, \nwhen notified that a provider of health insurance has reli-\ngious objections to providing (through insurance companies \nor directly) coverage for some government-approved medi-\ncal procedure, the government directs the insurer(s) to pro-\nvide the coverage itself. This direction constitutes what is \ntermed a “plan instrument,” and section 402(a) of ERISA, 29 \nU.S.C. § 1102(a), requires that every employee benefit plan \nbe established and maintained pursuant to a written instru-\nment that must designate one or more named fiduciaries to \nadminister the plan. The plan instrument designates the plan \nadministrator;  the  governmental  plan  instrument  in  this \ncase—the government’s direction to the insurer—designates \nthe  insurer  as  the  plan  administrator.  29  U.S.C. \n§ 1002(16)(A)(i). What had been Wheaton’s plan, so far as \nemergency  contraception  was  concerned,  the  Affordable \nCare Act made the government’s plan when Wheaton re-\nfused to comply with the Act’s provision on contraception \ncoverage. \n  Last the college argues that the government conduct that \nit asks us to enjoin “violates the Administrative Procedure \nAct because it is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.” \nBut this just relabels the grounds for relief that we’ve dis-\ncussed; there is no additional argumentation. \nQuite  apart  from  the  merits  of  its  arguments,  or  lack \nthereof, Wheaton College has failed to satisfy two basic re-\nquirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction. It \nhas failed to show that delaying a judgment in its favor to \nthe conclusion of proceedings in the district court would do \nthe college any harm. In the absence of any evidence or even \nallegation that any member of the college community is vio-\n\nCase: 14-2396      Document: 86            Filed: 07/01/2015      Pages: 18\n18  No. 14-2396 \nlating or is expected to violate or believed likely to violate \nthe college’s prohibition of emergency contraception, there is \nno reason to think that even if the college’s merely notifying \nthe government of its objection to emergency contraception \ncould “trigger” emergency-contraception coverage it would \ndo  so  while  this  case  was  pending.  The  college  has  also \nfailed to match the relief it seeks to the illegalities it alleges. \nAlmost the entire weight of its case falls on attempting to \nshow that the government is trying to “use” the college’s \nhealth plans, and it is this alleged use that it primarily asks \nus to enjoin. But the government isn’t using the college’s \nhealth  plans,  as  we  have  explained  at  perhaps  excessive \nlength.  And  the  relief  sought  has  no  connection  to \nWheaton’s complaints about allegedly forced speech and the \nalleged violation of ERISA and the APA; nor has Wheaton \noffered support for its claim to be treated as if it were a \nchurch. \nThe denial of a preliminary injunction is therefore \nAFFIRMED.

Dow, Jr. \n              )  \n  Defendants.     ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n  Plaintiff Wheaton College is a Christian liberal arts college that provides health insurance \nbenefits to its employees and students and opposes abortion and abortifacient contraceptives on \nreligious grounds.  Plaintiff alle ges that its religious beliefs will be i mpermissibly and \nsubstantially burdened by regulations prom ulgated pursu ant to th e Patien t Protection and  \nAffordable Care Act (“ACA”) that require grou p health insurance plans to cover “all Food and \nDrug Adm inistration-approved con traceptive met hods, sterilization p rocedures, and patient \neducation and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.”  78 Fed. Reg. 39870, 39870 \n(July 2, 2013) (“the Mandate”).  Plaintiff is elig ible for an accommodation that would excuse it \nfrom complying with the Mandate, but alleges that it should be e ligible for an exemption rather \nthan an accommodation and, moreover, that complying with the procedures necessary to obtain \nan accommodation – namely, completing and submitting to its third-party administrator “EBSA \nForm 700—Certification” – will  “make it morally com plicit in  the wrongful destruction of \nhuman life.”  Plaintiff argues that the Mandate violates the First Amendment and the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) and was en acted in violation of  the Adm inistrative \nProcedures Act (“APA”).  Plaintiff has request ed a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants  \n\nfrom enforcing the Mandate, which Defendants m ay enforce against Plaintiff as early as July 1,  \n2014.  \n  Defendants (“the Governm ent”) moved to  dismiss all sixteen co unts of Plaintiff’s \ncomplaint or, in the alternative, f or summary judgment.  See [25].  Pl aintiff cross-moved for \nsummary judgment on six counts,  see [41], [44], and also sought addition al discovery under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) in the even t that its cross-motion were denied.  See [43].   \nThe parties fully brief ed these m otions, and  the Court has taken their submissions under \nadvisement.  Because (1) the Mandate will take effect for Plaintiff on July 1, 2014, and (2) two \ncases currently pending before the United States Suprem e Court,  Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby \nStores, Inc., No. 13-354, and  Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius , No. 13-356, m ay \naffect the ultim ate resolution of at least som e of Plaintiff’s claim s, Plaintiff has moved for a \npreliminary injunction with resp ect to each of the six coun ts on which it has cross -moved for \nsummary judgment.  See [57], [58].  The Government opposes the motion [59].1    \n  For the reasons stated below, the Court  respectfully deni es Plai ntiff’s mot ions for  \npreliminary injunction [ 57], [58].  To the ex tent that Hobby Lobby  and Conestoga call into \nquestion any material aspect of the Seventh Circuit’s controlling decision in University of Notre \nDame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014), any party m ay file a motion for reconsideration \nof this order.  This order is also subject to reconsideration on the Court’s own motion. \n  This matter is set for a telephonic status conference on 6/30/2014 at 10:00 a.m.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Briefing on the motions was delayed until after the Seventh Circuit issued its decision in University of \nNotre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014), and thus  was not co mplete until May 19.  The \nCourt convened a conference call with counsel on June 9 to discuss how to proceed in light of the fact that \nthe Supreme Court had not yet issued its rulings in the  Hobby Lobby and Conestoga cases.  During that \ncall, the parties agreed to an expedited schedule for the filing of the briefs in support of and in opposition \nto the preliminary injunction motion.   \n2 \n \n\nI. Background    \n  Plaintiff is a Chris tian liberal arts colleg e located in Wheaton, Illinois.  Plaintiff is not \naffiliated or associated with any one particul ar church, th ough it characterizes its beliefs as \n“Evangelical Protestant.”  [41] at 10.   All m embers of Plaintiff’s “community,”  i.e., its \nemployees and students, “assent to  [Plaintiff’s] religious beliefs, including its be liefs about the \nsanctity of life.”   Id. at 3.  Pursuant to its beliefs about  the sanctity of life, Plaintiff opposes \ncontraceptive m ethods that “m ay act by k illing a hum an em bryo,” including em ergency \ncontraception like Plan B and ella.  Id.  “As part of its religious convictions, [Plaintiff] prom otes \nthe well-being and health of its  students and employees * * * [by]  provi[ding] generous health \nservices and health insurance.”  [1] ¶ 38.  The  health insurance that Plaintiff currently offers \ncovers some contraceptives but not those to which Plaintiff is religiously opposed.  See [41] at 5.   \nPlaintiff offers its health insurance pursuant to six plans:  two insured HMO plans, a PPO plan, 2 \ntwo self-funded prescription dr ug plans, and an insured st udent health plan.  See  id. at 4.  The \n“plan year” for Plaintiff’s insurance plans begins on July 1, 2014.  [1] ¶¶ 46, 155.  \n  The Seventh Circuit recently provided a co mprehensive discussion of the genesis and \nmechanics of the ACA, the Mandate, and the ex emption and accomm odation at issue here in \nUniversity of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014).  As the parties are fa miliar \nwith – and generally in  agreement about – these m atters, and the Court anticip ates addressing \nthem more robustly in its upcom ing summ ary  judgment ruling, the Court incorporates the \nSeventh Circuit’s discussion by reference and in cludes here only those background details m ost \npertinent to the resolution of the instant motion.   \n \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff’s PPO plan is “ grandfathered” for p urposes of the ACA, such that it is  not subject to the \nMandate.   \n3 \n \n\n  The ACA requires em ployers with 50 or m ore full-time employees to provide health \ninsurance for their full-tim e employees or pay  a penalty on their federal tax return.  See 26 \nU.S.C. § 4980H.   The ACA also requires that n on-exempt group health plans offer coverage for \ncertain preventive services without cost-sharing requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13.  These \npreventive servic es in clude “with  respec t to  wom en, such additiona l preventive care and \nscreenings * * * as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration [HRSA].”  42 U. S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).   The HRSA’s guidelines \ninclude “[a]ll Food and Drug Adm inistration a pproved contraceptive m ethods, sterilization \nprocedures, and patient educati on and counseling for all wom en with reproductive capacity.”   \nHHS, Women’s Preventive Health Services Guidelines, http://www.hrsa.gov/womenshealthguid \nelines.  Failure to provide the required coverage for contraception results in a variety of negative \ntax consequences to the employer, including a daily tax of $100 per day per individual “to whom \nsuch failure relates.”  26 U.S.C. §§ 4980D(a),  (b)(1).  Employers who do not provide insurance  \nat all (despite being required to do so) face an annual tax of $2,000 per full-time employee.  See \n26 U.S.C. § 4980H.  Plaintiff avers that it faces up to $34.8 million in annual tax penalties under \nthese provisions.  \n  As the Seventh Circuit explained in Notre Dame, “the government, some months after the \nenactment of the Affordable Care Act, created  by administrative regulation an exemption from \nthe guidelines.”   Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 550.  The exem ption applies only to “religious \nemployers,” those that are “organized and operate[] as a non-profit entity and [are] referred to in \nsection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”  45 C.F.R. § \n147.131(a).  After some pushback from religious entities that did not fall within the scope of the \nnarrow exem ption, the Governm ent promulgated new regulations im plementing the \n4 \n \n\naccommodation at issue here.  See 78 Fed.  Reg. 39870, 39875-90 (July  2, 2013); 29 C.F.R. §  \n2590.715-2713A(a); 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b).  Per those  regulations, which Plaintiff alleges were \npromulgated in contravention of the APA, relig ious organizations that  do not f all within th e \nambit of the exemption may seek an accommodation from the Mandate on religious grounds.  An \norganization seeking the accommodation must satisfy four requirements: \n  (1) The organization opposes providi ng coverage for som e or all of any \ncontraceptive services required to  be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on \naccount of religious objections. \n  (2) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity. \n  (3) The organization holds itself out as a religious organization. \n  (4) The organization self-certifies, in a form and manner specified by the \nSecretary, that it satisfies  the criteria in paragraphs  (b)(1) through (3) of this \nsection, and makes such self-certification available for examination upon request \nby the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) \nof this section app lies.  The self-cer tification m ust be executed by a person \nauthorized to m ake the certification on be half of the organization, and m ust be \nmaintained in m anner consistent with  the record retenti on requirements under \nsection 107 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. \n \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b).  There is no  dispute that Plaintiff satisf ies requirements (1)-(3); its \nobjection is to the self-certification required by 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b)(4).   \n  Employers seeking the accommodation m ust  execute th e self-certification form and \nfurnish a copy to their health in surance issuers or third-party  administrators.  T he recipient \n“issuers” “may not require any  documentation other than the copy  of the self-certification from \nthe eligible organization regarding its status as such.”  45  C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1).  The recipient \nissuers are required to “[e]xpr essly exclude contraceptive c overage from  the group health \ninsurance coverage provided in connection with  the group health plan; and [p]rovide separate \npayments for any contraceptive services requ ired to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) for \nplan participants and benefi ciaries so long as they rem ain enrolled in the plan.”   Id. § \n147.131(c)(2)(i).  Additionally, issuers are barred  from imposing any cost-sharing requirements \n5 \n \n\n“on the eligible organization, the  group health plan, or plan partic ipants or beneficiaries,” and \nmust “segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used \nto provide paym ents for c ontraceptive s ervices.”   Id. § 147.131(c)(2)(ii).  The regulations  \nprohibit accommodated entities from “(1) [d]irectly  or indirectly interf ering with a  third pa rty \nadministrator’s efforts to provide or arrange se parate payments for con traceptive services for \nparticipants or beneficiaries in the plan and (2) di rectly or indirectly seeking to influence a third \nparty administrator’s decision to provide or arrange such payments,” 78 Fed. Reg. 39870, 39879-\n80 (July 2, 2013); a footnote clarifie s that “[n]othing in these fi nal regulations prohibits an \neligible organization from expressing its  opposition to the use of  contraceptives.”  Id. at 39880 \nn.41.   \n  Plaintiff contends that “signing and the delivering EBSA Form 700 to its insurer and TPA \n[third-party adm inistrator] w ould m ake it m orally com plicit in  the wrongful destruction of \nhuman life.”  [41] at 6.  Plainti ff further contends that the self-certification form would give its \nTPA “the legal authority to provide contraceptiv es to W heaton’s employees at no costs” and \nwould undermine the contract between Plaintiff  and its TPA because Plaintiff “is the plan \nadministrator and fiduciary, and Wheaton’s TPA has no authority to change the terms of the plan \nwithout Wheaton’s express permission.”  [41] at 5.  Plaintiff also argues that complying with the \nregulations barring it from  interfering with o r seeking to in fluence the TPA’s provision of \ncontraception, which Plaintiff term s the “gag  rule,” “would prevent Wheaton from  speaking \nfreely about its objectio ns to lif e-ending emergency contraceptives or instru cting its TPA t o \nprovide some contraceptives but not others.”  Id. at 6.  Yet, if Plaintiff does not comply with the \nMandate and associated regulations, or com plete and sub mit to its T PA the self -certification \nform, Plaintiff will be subject to a sizeable tax.  Plaintiff seeks preliminary injunctive relief from \n6 \n \n\nthis conundrum  under the Religious Freedom   and Res toration Act (“RFRA”), the First \nAmendment’s religion and free speech clauses, and the Administrative Procedure Act.  \nII. Legal  Standard \n  “To obtain a prelim inary injunction, the m oving party m ust show that it has ‘(1) no \nadequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is denied and \n(2) some likelihood of success on th e merits.’”  Wis. Right to Life, Inc. v. Barland , --- F.3d ---, \n2014 WL 1929619, at *23 (7th Ci r. May 14, 2014) (quoting Ezell v. City of Chi., 651 F.3d 684, \n694 (7th Cir. 2011)).   The thresho ld for establishing likelihood of success is relatively low.   \nMich. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 667 F.3d 765, 782 (7th Cir. 2011).  The moving party must \nonly “present a claim  plausible  enough that (if the othe r preliminary injunction f actors cut in \ntheir favor), the entry of a preliminary injunction would be an appropriate step.”  Id. at 783.  \n   “If this showing is m ade, ‘the court weighs the competing harms to the par ties if an \ninjunction is granted or denied and al so considers the public interest.’”  Wis. Right to Life, 2014 \nWL 1929619, at *23 (quoting  Korte v. S ebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 665 (7th Ci r. 2013)).  “The  \n‘equitable balancing proceeds on a sliding-scale analysis; the greater the likelihood of success on \nthe merits, the le ss heavily the balance of  harms must tip in the  moving party’s favor.’”   Id. \n(quoting Korte, 735 F.3d at 665).  In First Am endment cases such as this one, the likelihood of  \nsuccess on the merits is usually the determinative factor.  Id. at *24.  The loss or impingement of \nfreedoms protected by the First Amendment “unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,” Am. \nCivil Liberties Union of Ill. v. A lvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 589 (7th  Cir. 2012) (quoting  Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion )), and “injunctions  protecting First  \nAmendment freedoms are always  in the public interest.”   Id. at 590 (quoting  Christian Legal \n7 \n \n\nSoc’y v. Walker, 453 F.3d 853, 859 (7th Cir. 2006)); see also  Smith v. Executive Director of Ind. \nWar Mem’ls Comm’n, 742 F.3d 282, 286 (7th Cir. 2014).   \nIII. Analysis   \n  A.   Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  1.  RFRA  \n  Under RFRA, the federal governm ent “may substantially burden a person’s exercise of \nreligion only if it de monstrates that application of the burden to the person (1) is in furtherance \nof a compelling governmental interest; and (2)  is  the least restrictive means of furthering that \ncompelling governmental interest.”  42 U.S.C.  § 2000bb-1(b).  A plaintiff  states a prima facie \ncase under RFRA by dem onstrating that governmental action substa ntially burdens its sincere \nreligious exercise.  See  Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita  Beneficente Uniao de Vegetal , 546 U.S. \n418, 428 (2006);  Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554.  If the plainti ff clears that hurdle, the burden \nshifts to the government to demonstrate that the challenged action  was taken in furtherance of a \ncompelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.  See Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654, 685 (7th Cir. 2013).   \n  Here, Plaintiff contends that its sincere religious exercise will be substantially burdened if \nit is required to complete the EBSA Form 700.  Plaintiff argues that it “cannot execute the self-\ncertification form the government has provided without making  itself morally complicit in the \ngovernment’s schem e,” [41] at 20, because d oing so would “facilitate use of em ergency \ncontraceptives in violation  of its s incere beliefs,”  id. at 22, and would m aterially alter its \ncontractual relationship with its T PA by i mposing upon the TPA a duty to becom e a plan \nadministrator with resp ect to the o bjected-to contraceptives. See  id. at 22-23.  Plaintiff also \n8 \n \n\ncontends that the Government cannot shoulder its burden of de monstrating that enforcement of \nthe Mandate is the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling governmental interest.   \n  Although there is no dispute th at Plaintiff’s religious beli efs are sincere, the C ourt \nconcludes that Plaintiff  has no  likelihood of success in establishi ng a substantial burden on its \nreligious exercise, at least as the law in this and the only other circuit to  have directly engaged \nthe issue currently stands.  In Notre Dame, the Seventh Circuit squarely rejected the University \nof Notre Dam e’s contention that “filling out  the form and sending it to the com panies * * * \n‘triggers’ their coverage of the contracep tion costs of the univers ity’s female employees and \nstudents, and that this m akes the univers ity an accomplice in the p rovision of con traception.”  \nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554.  As the Seventh Circuit explained, “[f]ederal law, not the religious \norganization’s signing and mailing the form, requires health-care insurers, along with third-party \nadministrators of self-insur ed health plans, to cover contraceptiv e services.”   Id.  The Sixth \nCircuit recently came to the sam e conclusion in  Michigan Catholic Conference & Catholic  \nFamily Services v. Burwell, --- F.3d ---, 2014  WL 2596753, at *8- 10 (6th Cir. June 11, 2014).   \nThese cases strongly suggest that, unl ess the Suprem e Court’s rulings in  Hobby Lobby  or \nConestoga significantly change the legal landscape, Pl aintiff’s likelihood of dem onstrating that \nthe accommodation process substantially burdens its religious exercise is insufficient to meet the \nthreshold required to warrant a preliminary injunction on this basis.3   \n  The Court is not persuaded at this juncture  that Plaintiff’s situation (or legal arguments) \nare distinguishable from those rejected in  Notre Dame  and Michigan Catholic Conference .  \n                                                 \n3 The Court is aware that the Notre Dame panel decision was not unanimous and that Judge Flaum filed a \nwell-reasoned dissenting opinion explaining why he  would  have granted a preli minary injunction \nforbidding t he governm ent from  penalizing the  university fo r refusing t o com ply with the self-\ncertification requirement.  See Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 562 (Flaum , J., dissenting).  However, because \nthat view did not prevail with the panel majority and the petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc was \ndenied, Plaintiff is swimming against the tide of controlling law in this circuit, which this Court is dut y-\nbound to apply. \n9 \n \n\nPlaintiff rightly points out that , unlike Notre Dam e, it has not yet signed the EBSA For m 700.  \nBut that is  of  little m oment, sinc e Plaintif f’s theory r ises and f alls on the app eals court’s \nconclusion that federal law, not Plaintiff’s execution of the EBSA Form 700, is the source of the \nTPA’s and health insurer’s obligations.  Plaintiff  is distinguishable from Notre Dame in that it \nhas furnished the Court with (excerpts of) its insurance contracts and argues that the provisions \nof the contracts would be materially altered if it executes and delivers the self-certification.  See \n[41-4]; Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 555.  However, even  though the S eventh Circuit did not \ncomprehensively address the contract argument in Notre Dame due to Notre Dam e’s forfeiture \nand failure to presen t evidence “th at its contract  with Meritain forbids the la tter to be a plan  \nfiduciary,” the court nonetheless pronounced  Notre Dam e’s argument “unconvincing.”   Notre \nDame, 743 F.3d at 555.  In reach ing this conclusion,  the Seventh Circuit explained that “the \nuniversity has not been told to name Meritain as a plan fiduciary.  Rather, the signed form ‘shall \nbe treated [by the governm ent] as a designation of the third pa rty administrator as the p lan \nadministrator under section 3(16) of ERISA for  any contraceptive servic es required to be \ncovered.’”  Id. (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b)).  The Se venth Circuit appears to have been \ndrawing a distinction between tre ating an ins urer or TPA as a p lan administrator for so me \npurposes and formally imbuing the entity with full fiduciary responsibilities. The Court finds this \ndistinction persuasive, particularly  in light of the dearth of au thority in support of Plaintiff’s \nargument and the broader principle that partie s in many circumstances cannot contract around \nstatutory obligations.  See  United States v. Lupton, 620 F.3d 790, 800 (7th Cir. 2010) (“Parties \ncannot con tract aroun d definitio ns provided in crim inal statutes .”);  Equal Employment \nOpportunity Comm’n v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co. , 256 F.3d 516, 532 (7th Cir.  2001) (en banc) (Flaum, \nC.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part ) (“It is uncontested that em ployers cannot use  \n10 \n \n\ncollective bargaining agreements to contract ar ound anti-discrimination laws like Title VII. ”).  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not established a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of its RFRA claim at this time.   \n   2.  First Amendment Religion Clauses \n  Plaintiff next contends  that “[t]he Manda te violates the Religion Clauses becau se it \nimpermissibly discr iminates am ong re ligious in stitutions asser ting th e exac t s ame religiou s \nobjection.  Som e favored ‘relig ious em ployers’ are exem pt from the Mandate and the  \nrequirement to execute EBSA For m 700.  Yet othe rs like Wheaton, who wish to engage in the \nexact same religious ex ercise as ‘relig ious employers,’ are forced to com ply or pay m assive \npenalties.”  [41] at 9.  Plain tiff asserts that the Government’s implementation of the exemption \nand accom modation d raws “exp licit and deliberate  distinctions between different religiou s \norganizations” and “violate[s] both the Free  Exercise and Establishment Clause.”   Id. (quoting \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 246 n. 23 (1982)).   \n  The Seventh Circuit expressly rejected Plaintiff’s argument in Notre Dame. There, Notre \nDame argued that the exemption violated the Establishment Clause by “favor[ing] c ertain types \nof religious organizations (churches or other houses of worship) over others (like Notre Dame).”  \nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 560.  The Seventh Circuit obser ved that “religious employers, defined \nas in the cited regulation, have long enjoyed a dvantages (notably tax advantages) over other \nentities without these advantages being thought  to violate the establishm ent clause.”   Id. \n(citations omitted).  The court further noted that the distinction was not based on denom ination, \nand held that the Establishment Clause “does not require the government to equalize the burdens \n(or benefits) that laws of general appli cability impose on religious ins titutions.”  Id.  The Sixth \nCircuit likewise rejected a sim ilar challenge to the exemption and accommodation in Michigan \n11 \n \n\nCatholic Conference.  See 2014 WL 2596753, at *16-17.   The Sixth Circuit quoted the sam e \nSupreme Court case that Plaintiff does here for  the proposition that “[t]he clearest command o f \nthe Establishment Clause is that  one religious denom ination cannot be officially preferred over \nanother,” id. at *16 (quoting  Larson, 456 U.S. at 244), and conclude d that “[t]he line that the \nexemption and accommodation fra mework draws between eligibility for the exemption and fo r \nthe accommodation is b ased on organizational form and purpose, not religious deno mination.”  \nId.  The Sixth Circuit also  persuasively distinguished Colorado Christian University v. Weaver, \n534 F.3d 1245 (10th Cir. 2008), on whic h Plaintiff relies here.  See  Michigan Catholic \nConference, 2014 WL 2596753, at *16; [41] at 9-10; [52]  at 5-6.  The Court  finds particularly \ncompelling the Sixth Circuit’s observation that  some of the Catholic plaintiffs i n Michigan \nCatholic Conference were eligible for the exemption and some for the accommodation; this is a \nclear indication that denom ination is not th e relevant metric for the exemption.  See  Michigan \nCatholic Conference, 2014 WL 2596753, at *16.   \n  The “constitutional prohibition of denom inational preferences is in extricably connected \nwith the continuing vitality of the Free Exercise Clause.”   Larson, 456 U.S. at 245. And here, \nPlaintiff does not separate out its Religion Clause  contentions.  See [41]  at 9-12.  To the extent \nthat Plaintiff is alleging that the Mandate is not neutral or generally ap plicable, the Court finds \npersuasive the Sixth Circuit’s contrary conclusion.  See Michigan Catholic Conferenc, 2014 WL \n2596753, at *14-16.  Plaintiff also makes the additional argument that the Government violated \nits First Amendment rights by “press[ing] ahead with its narrow church-focused exemption in the \nface of” evidence from Plaintiff  and other religious colleges  that their full-time administrators \n12 \n \n\nand faculty4 share the faith of the institutions.  See [41] at 12.  Notre Dame raised essentially the \nsame point, however, see University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, Case No. 13-3853, Dkt. No. 20, \nat 15 (7th Cir. Jan. 13, 2014), and the Seventh Circuit implicitly concluded that this fact “add[ed] \nnothing to [Notre Dame’s] RFRA arguments” and did not “warrant discussion.”   Notre Dame, \n743 F.3d at 560.  The Court finds it self constrained by controlling circuit precedent to reach the \nsame conclusion at this juncture.  \n     3. APA   \n  The APA authorizes f ederal cour ts to se t  aside agency action s that are “arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discreti on, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A).  Plaintiff contends that the Government’s enactment of the Mandate, exemption, and \naccommodation framework should be set aside as  violative of the APA  because it “ignored key \naspects of the problem before them, relied on misinterpretations of the facts and laws, and relied \non false assum ptions about the religious belief s of e mployees at Evangelical Protestant \ninstitutions like W heaton.”  [41] at 13-14.  N amely, Plaintiff argues  that the Mandate was \nenacted in contravention of the APA because the Government declined to widen the scope of the \nexemption to include Plaintiff even after Plain tiff informed the Government that its em ployees \n(its faculty and administrators, at least) embrace its religious views.  See id. at 13-14.   \n  Plaintiff’s APA argument is not persuasive.  First, as Plaintiff recognizes in its brief, see \n[41] at 12, the APA argum ent is very closely re lated to the religion clauses argum ent discussed \nabove.  Both theories fundamentally challenge the line that the Government has drawn between \nthe exemption and the accomm odation. (Notably, however, Plaintiff does not directly contend  \nthat the Mandate violates the APA because it is unconstitutional.  See [41] at 12-14.)  In light of \n                                                 \n4  The statement from  the Council f or Christian Co lleges and  Universities  said nothi ng about  the \nuniversities’ lower-level employees or students necessarily sharing their religious beliefs.  See [41] at 12; \n[41-11].   \n13 \n \n\nthe Seventh Circuit’s clear rejection of the constitutional argument, it is dif ficult to envision a \nscenario in which Plaintiff could prevail on its  closely related APA argument, which affords the \nGovernment a significantly m ore deferential sta ndard of review.  Sec ond, to the extent that \nPlaintiff’s APA argument  is distinct f rom its re ligion c lauses argum ents, the Court is not  \nconvinced at this tim e that it has any likelihoo d of success on the m erits.  Plaintiff essentially  \ncontends that because the Government ignored or  failed to consider a single p iece of evidence \nwhen drafting regulations, the resultant regulations necessarily are contrary to the evidence.  This \nargument conflates a sin gle piece of evidence with  “the evidence” as a whole.  In most every \ncontentious case or rule-m aking process, the d ecision-maker is p resented with  conflicting  \nevidence and is tasked with rendering a decisio n in accordance with the evidence overall, no t \nmerely a single piece.  Here, Plaintiff asserts  that the Government disregarded its evidence and  \nrelied instead on a purportedly faulty assum ption that the “church-focused religious em ployer \nexemption was justified because church employees were more likely than the employees of other \nreligious non-profits to agree with their em ployers’ religious views.”  [ 41] at 13.  Plaintiff’s  \nevidence may have supported the contrary conclusion (at least as  to high-level employees at the \nsignatory colleges), but there is n o indication at th is time that the b ulk of other subm itted \nevidence did as well.  The Government is required only to provide a “concise general statement” \nof a rule’s basis and purpose, 5 U.S.C. § 553(c ), not to furnish a detailed exp lanation that \nspecifically addresses every sing le evidentiar y subm ission m ade to it during a notice-and-\ncomment period.  Acco rdingly, Plaintiff has not  demonstrated a likelih ood of success on the \nmerits of its APA claim.   \n \n \n14 \n \n\n    4.  First Amendment Free Speech Clause   \n  Plaintiff contends th at the Mandate violates th e First Am endment’s free speech clause \nbecause the Mandate “forces Wheaton to speak against its will, and in a way that co ntradicts its \nbeliefs.”  [41] at 14.  The firs t prong of Plaintiff’s argum ent is that the requirem ent that it \ncomplete the self-certification form is tantam ount to the Governm ent mandating speech th at \nPlaintiff otherwise would not m ake.  See  id. (citing Entm’t Software Ass’n v. Blagojevich, 469 \nF.3d 641, 651 (7th Cir. 2006)).  Plaintiff asserts th at the EBSA Form 700 “triggers payments for \nthe use of abortifacient drugs and services, including for ‘education and counseling’ about those \nproducts to Wheaton’s plan participants.”   Id.  As discussed above,  the Seventh Circuit has \nsquarely rejected the “trigg er” theory.  Ind eed, both the Seventh and Sixth C ircuits have \nconcluded that the self-certificat ion form “triggers the entities’  disassociation from what they \ndeem to be objectionable coverage.”  Michigan Catholic Conference, 2014 WL 2596753, at *13; \nsee Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 557-58.  To the extent that  Plaintiff’s free speech argum ent is \npredicated on the “trigger” theory, it cannot succeed absent a change in the controlling law. \n  Plaintiff also contends that th e so-called  “gag rule” vio lates its free speech rights by \nprohibiting it from  “request[ing]  that its TP As not use its  plans to provide em ergency \ncontraceptives.”  [41] at 17.  Plaintiff rightly points out that the Seventh Circuit’s ruling in Notre \nDame does not foreclose this argum ent.  To t he contrary, the Seventh Circuit recognized that \n“most speech or writing intended to influence someone else’s decision – to persuade someone to \ndo or not do som ething – is protected” by the First Am endment, Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 560, \nand was “troubled by the seeming vagueness of the regulation as drafted and as further muddied \nin the f ootnote in the c ommentary.”   Id. at 561.  The Seventh Circui t did not provide further \nguidance, however, because “the p arties have failed to p lace the issu e in focus.”   Id.  The \n15 \n \n\nSeventh Circuit noted that Notre Dam e “hasn’t to ld us what it wants to say but fears to say \n(except that it at least wants to be able to tell Meritain not to provide c ontraceptive coverage at \nall – which sounds like urging civi l disobedience) and the governm ent hasn’t clearly embraced \nan interpretation of the regulation that would gi ve rise to the concer ns we’ve expressed.”   Id.  \nThe Sixth Circuit found similar impediments to making a merits ruling on this point in Michigan \nCatholic Conference.  See Michigan Catholic Conference, 2014 WL 2596753, at *14.  Plaintiff \nhere has spelled out in som e detail the contours of what it wishes  to say but fears that it cannot \nwithout running afoul of the regulation. \n  The Government responds that the “gag rul e” is “meant only to prevent a self-certifying \norganization from using its economic power into  not fulfilling its legal  obligation to provide \ncontraceptive coverage.”  [49] at 13.  Plainti ff and the Governm ent each have pointed to one \ndistrict court case supp orting their view.  See  Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. \nSebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2013 WL 6729515, at *38 (D.D.C. Dec. 20, 2013) (Plain tiff); \nMichigan Catholic Conference v. Sebelius, --- F. Supp. 2d ---, 2013 WL 6838707, at *11 (W.D. \nMich. Dec. 27, 2013) (Government).   \n  Based on the reco rd curren tly b efore it,  the Court concludes  that Pl aintiff has \ndemonstrated some likelihood of success on the m erits of its “gag rule” cl aim.  That being said, \nhowever, it is clear from Plaintiff’s briefing and its proposed order that what it seeks in the way \nof immediate and preliminary relief is an injunction barring the  Government from enforcing the \nMandate and requiring Plaintiff to  sign the EBSA Form  700.  It is  unclear to the Court how an \ninjunction as to enforcement of the “gag rule” could give Plaintiff this relief; it would still need \nto fill out the for m.  The Court will explo re with counsel at the nex t status h earing whether \nPlaintiff wishes to pursue prelim inary injunc tive relief on the “gag rule” asp ects of the  \n16 \n \n\nregulations or whether it is  content to await the Court’s fo rthcoming summary judgment ruling \non that issue.  In either case, the Court may request supplemental briefing to ascertain the parties’ \nviews on the content of any injunction order to which Plaintiff may be entitled on this issue.  See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(B) (requiring courts to state terms of an injunction order “specifically”). \nB. Remaining  Factors \n  Because the majority opinion in Notre Dame stands squarely in the path of the principal \nrelief that Plaintiff seeks, Pl aintiff cannot demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success on th e \nmerits of its claims. Accordingly, the m otion for preliminary injunction m ust be denied. See, \ne.g., Cox v. City of Chi. , 868 F.2d 217, 223 (7th Cir. 1989).  In the interest of completeness, \nhowever, the Court will briefly address the other  factors that are considered at the prelim inary \ninjunction stage. \n  The other two threshold elem ents that Plaintiff must prove to suppo rt the issuance of a \npreliminary injun ction are  tha t it (1)  has  n o adequate rem edy at law and  (2) will suffer \nirreparable harm if the injunc tion is not issu ed. These two requirem ents tend to m erge. See \nRoland Mach. Co. v. Dr esser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 387 (7th Cir. 1984). “The question is \nthen whether the plaintiff will be m ade whole  if he p revails on the m erits and is award ed \ndamages.”  Id.  An injury is “irreparable” when it is of such a nature that the injured party cannot \nbe adequately compensated in damages or when damages cannot be measured by any pecuniary \nstandard. Meridian Mut. Ins. Co. v.  Meridian Ins. Grp., Inc. , 128 F.3d 1111, 1120 (7th Cir. \n1997).  Here, there is no question that Plain tiff has made these showings. The loss or \nimpingement of freedom s protected by the Fi rst Am endment “unq uestionably constitutes \nirreparable injury,” Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ill. v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 589 (7th Cir. 2012) \n17 \n \n\n(quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)), and such an injury cannot \nbe remedied by the receipt of damages.  \nThe Court likewise concludes that at least in the short term – that is, between today and \nthe time by which the C ourt will be in position  to rule on the summ ary judgment motions with \nthe benefit of the parties’ views on Hobby Lobby and Conestoga – the balance of harms strongly \nweighs in P laintiff’s favor.  See  Korte, 735 F.3d at 665 (“[ T]he court weights the com peting \nharms to the parties if an injunction is granted or denied and also considers the public interest.”).  \nThe potential harm s to Plaintiff are substan tial.  If  Hobby Lobby  and  Conestoga  do not  \nsubstantially change the  legal lands cape, Plaintiff will be faced with the Hobson’s choice of \nadhering to its religious beliefs or being subjected to steep fina ncial penalties.  The short-run \ncosts to the Government, on the other hand, are purely financial and will be minimal in the time \nframe referenced above.  The Governm ent would  at most lose for a short period of tim e its \nability to collect tax penalties from Plaintiff, an ability that it currently lacks as to many similarly \nsituated entities whose insurance “p lan years” happen to begin later in  the year.  S ee 78 Fed. \nReg. 39872.  Nonetheless, these considerations do  not come into play in light of Plaintiff’s \ncurrent inability to demonstrate that it is likely to prevail on the merits of its claims.   \n   \n18 \n \n\nIV. Conclusion \n  For the reasons stated above, the Court re spectfully denies Plai ntiff’s m otions for  \npreliminary injunction [ 57], [58].  To the ex tent that Hobby Lobby  and Conestoga call into \nquestion any material aspect of the Seventh Circuit’s controlling decision in University of Notre \nDame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014), any party m ay file a motion for reconsideration \nof this order.  This order is  also subject to rec onsideration on the Court’s own m otion.  This \nmatter is set for a telephonic status conference on 6/30/2014 at 10:00 a.m.  \n \n \nDated:  June 23, 2014         ___________________________________ \n       Robert  M.

At  the  time  that  Wheaton’s  request  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction first came before the Court [see 58], the Seventh Circuit’s controlling decision in \nUniversity of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014), mandated a decision in favor \nof Defendants.  As the Court observed in its opinion denying Wheaton’s motion, in Notre Dame, \n“Judge Flaum filed a well-reasoned dissenting opinion explaining why he would have granted a \npreliminary injunction forbidding the government from penalizing the university for refusing to \ncomply  with  the  self-certification  requirement”  imposed  under  the  ACA’s  implementing \nregulations.  [See 62, at 9 n.3 (citing Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 562 (Flaum, J., dissenting)).]  Yet, \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 119 Filed: 02/22/18 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:26741\nthe Court further acknowledged that it was “duty-bound to apply” the decision of the panel \nmajority [see id.], while inviting any party to “file a motion for reconsideration of this order” \nshould any decision of the Supreme Court “call into question any material aspect of the Seventh \nCircuit’s controlling decision” in Notre Dame [see id. at 2].  On appeal of this Court’s ruling, the \nSeventh Circuit affirmed.  Wheaton College v. Burwell, 791 F.3d 792 (7th Cir. 2015).  This case \nwas then stayed pending the Supreme Court’s consideration of Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 \n(2016). \n  In the intervening years, the law has changed along the lines suggested by Judge Flaum.  \nFollowing oral argument in Zubik, the Supreme Court vacated the decisions of several circuits \nand remanded the cases so that the parties could be “afforded an opportunity to arrive at an \napproach going forward” that both “accommodates [the religious employers’] religious exercise” \nand ensures that “women covered by [their] health plans ‘receive full and equal health coverage, \nincluding contraceptive coverage.’”  136 S. Ct. at 1560.  After reconsideration of their position, \nDefendants  now  agree  that  enforcement  of  the  currently  operative  rules  regarding  the \n“contraceptive  mandate”  against  employers  with  sincerely  held  religious  objections  would \nviolate RFRA, and thus do not oppose Wheaton’s renewed motion for injunctive and declaratory \nrelief.  Defendants have simply requested certain limitations [see 117, at 2] on the scope of the \nrelief  requested  by  Wheaton,  to  which  Wheaton  has  no  objection  [see  118,  at  1].    After \nconsidering the parties’ briefs submitted on the motion for a permanent injunction, including \nDefendants’ concessions on the merits of Wheaton’s claims, the Court agrees that Wheaton is \nentitled to a permanent injunction.  \n  In particular, the Court concludes that the Wheaton has met the standards necessary for \ninjunctive relief:  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 119 Filed: 02/22/18 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:26742\n●  Wheaton  has  demonstrated,  and  Defendants  now  concede,  that \nenforcement  of  the  contraceptive  mandate  against  Wheaton  would  violate \nWheaton’s  rights  under  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act  (RFRA),  42 \nU.S.C. § 2000bb; \n \n●  Wheaton will suffer irreparable harm to its ability to practice its religious \nbeliefs, harm that is the direct result of Defendants’ conduct, unless Defendants \nare enjoined from further interfering with Wheaton’s practice of its religion; \n \n●  The threatened injury to Wheaton outweighs any injury to Defendants \nresulting from this injunction; and \n \n●  The public interest in the vindication of religious freedom favors the entry \nof an injunction.  \n \n  The Court therefore orders that Defendants, their agents, officers, and employees are \nenjoined and restrained from any effort to apply or enforce the substantive requirements imposed \nin  42  U.S.C.  §  300gg-13(a)(4)  as  those  requirements  relate  to  provision  of  contraceptive \ncoverage services which violate Wheaton College’s conscience, and are enjoined and restrained \nfrom pursuing, charging, or assessing penalties, fines, assessments, or any other enforcement \nactions for noncompliance related thereto, including those found in 26 U.S.C. §§ 4980D, 4980H, \nand 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1185d and including, but not limited to, penalties for failure to offer or \nfacilitate access to religiously-objectionable contraceptives, procedures, and related education \nand counseling, against Wheaton College and its insurers and third-party administrators, as their \nconduct relates to Wheaton College’s health plans. \n \n \nDate: February 22, 2018                    \n              Robert M. Dow, Jr. \n              United States District Judge     \n   \n \n3 \n ",

On the basis of this court's decision in Notre Dame v.\nSebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014), we believe that the appellant has not shown\nthat it is likely to prevail on the merits. And the decision today by the United States\nSupreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., −−−U.S.−−−, slip op.

SYLVIA BURWELL,   \nSECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN   \nSERVICES, ET  AL.  \nON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION  \n[July 3, 2014] \n  The application for an injunction having been submitted\nto JUSTICE KAGAN and by her referred to the Court, the \nCourt  orders:  If  the  applicant  informs  the  Secretary   of \nHealth and Human Services in writing that  it is a non-\nprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and \nhas religious objections to providing coverage for contra-\nceptive services, the respondents are enjoined from enforc-\ning against the applicant the challenged provisions of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related  \nregulations pending final disposition of appellate review. \nTo meet the condition for injunction pending appeal, the \napplicant need not use the form prescribed by the Gov-\nernment, EBSA Form 700, and need not send copies to \nhealth insurance issuers or third-party administrators. \n  The Circuit Courts have divided on whether to enjoin\nthe requirement that religious nonprofit organizations use \nEBSA Form 700.  Such division is a traditional ground for \ncertiorari.  See S. Ct. Rule 10(a).  \n  Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the\napplicant’s employees and students to obtain, without cost, \nthe full range of FDA approved contraceptives.  The Gov-\nernment contends that the applicant’s health insurance \nissuer  and  third-party  administrator  are  required  by \nfederal law to provide full contraceptive coverage regard-\nless  whether  the  applicant  completes  EBSA  Form  700.  \n\n2  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nThe applicant contends, by contrast, that the obligations of \nits health insurance issuer and third-party administrator \nare dependent on their receipt of notice that the applicant \nobjects to the contraceptive coverage requirement.  But  \nthe  applicant  has  already  notified  the  Government—\nwithout  using  EBSA  Form  700—that  it  meets  the  re-\nquirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement on religious grounds.  Nothing in this order\nprecludes the Government from relying on this notice, to \nthe extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provi-\nsion of full contraceptive coverage under the Act. \n  In light of the foregoing, this order should not be con-\nstrued as an expression of the Court’s views on the merits. \nJUSTICE SCALIA concurs in the result. \nJUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR,  with  whom  JUSTICE   GINSBURG  \nand JUSTICE  KAGAN join, dissenting. \n  The  Patient  Protection  and  Affordable  Care  Act,  124 \nStat. 119, through its implementing regulations, requires \nemployer group health insurance plans to cover contracep-\ntive services without cost sharing.  Recognizing that peo-\nple of religious faith may sincerely oppose the provision of \ncontraceptives, the Government has created certain excep-\ntions  to  this  requirement.  Churches  are  categorically  \nexempt.  Any religious nonprofit is also exempt, as long as \nit signs a form certifying that it is a religious nonprofit \nthat objects to the provision of contraceptive services, and \nprovides a copy of that form to its insurance issuer or \nthird-party administrator.  The form is simple.  The front \nasks the applicant to attest to the foregoing representa-\ntions; the back notifies third-party administrators of their \nregulatory obligations. \n  The matter before us is an application for an emergency \ninjunction filed by Wheaton College, a nonprofit liberal\narts college in Illinois.  There is no dispute that Wheaton \nis entitled to the religious-nonprofit exemption from the \n\n  Cite as:  573 U. S. ____ (2014)  3 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \ncontraceptive  coverage  requirement.    Wheaton  nonethe-\nless asserts that the exemption itself impermissibly bur-\ndens Wheaton’s free exercise of its religion in violation of\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), \n107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq., on the theory\nthat its filing of a self-certification form will make it com-\nplicit in the provision of contraceptives by triggering the \nobligation  for  someone  else   to  provide  the  services  to \nwhich it objects.  Wheaton has not stated a viable claim  \nunder RFRA.  Its claim ignores that the provision of con-\ntraceptive coverage is triggered not by its completion of \nthe self-certification form, but by federal law.\n  Even assuming that the accommodation somehow bur-\ndens Wheaton’s religious exercise, the accommodation is \npermissible under RFRA because it is the least restrictive \nmeans of furthering the Government’s compelling inter-\nests in public health and women’s well-being.  Indeed, just\nearlier this week in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \nante, at ___, the Court described the accommodation as “a  \nsystem that seeks to respect the religious liberty of reli-\ngious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the em-\nployees of these entities have precisely the same access to \nall [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]-approved con-\ntraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have \nno religious objections to providing such coverage.”  Ante,  \nat 3.  And the Court concluded that the accommodation \n“constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Gov-\nernment’s aims while providing  greater respect for reli-\ngious liberty.”  Ibid.  Those who are bound by our decisions \nusually believe they can take us at our word.  Not so to-\nday.  After  expressly  relying  on  the  availability  of  the\nreligious-nonprofit accommodation to hold that the contra-\nceptive coverage requirement violates RFRA as applied to \nclosely held for-profit corporations, the Court now, as the \ndissent in Hobby Lobby feared it might, see ante, at 29–30  \n(GINSBURG,   J.,   dissenting),  retreats  from  that  position.  \n\n4  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nThat action evinces disregard for even the newest of this \nCourt’s  precedents  and  undermines  confidence  in  this \ninstitution. \n  Even  if  one  accepts  Wheaton’s  view  that  the  self-\ncertification  procedure  violates  RFRA,  that  would  not  \njustify  the  Court’s  action  today.  The  Court  grants \nWheaton a form of relief as rare as it is extreme: an inter-\nlocutory injunction under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \n§1651, blocking the operation of a duly enacted law and \nregulations, in a case in which the courts below have not \nyet adjudicated the merits of the applicant’s claims and in \nwhich  those  courts  have  declined  requests  for  similar \ninjunctive  relief.  Injunctions  of  this  nature  are  proper \nonly  where  “the  legal  rights  at  issue  are  indisputably \nclear.”  Turner  Broadcasting  System,  Inc.   v.  FCC,  507  \nU. S. 1301, 1303 (1993) (Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Yet the Court today \norders this extraordinary relief even though no one could \ncredibly  claim  Wheaton’s  right  to  relief  is  indisputably \nclear. \n  The sincerity of Wheaton’s deeply held religious beliefs \nis beyond refute.  But as a legal matter, Wheaton’s appli-\ncation  comes  nowhere  near  the  high  bar  necessary  to \nwarrant an emergency injunction from this Court.  For  \nthat reason, I respectfully dissent. \nI  \nA  \n  The  Affordable  Care  Act  requires  certain  employer \ngroup health insurance plans to cover a number of preven-\ntative-health services without cost sharing.  These services \ninclude “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration . . . approved \ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and pa-\ntient education and counseling for all women with repro-\nductive capacity, as prescribed by a provider.”  77 Fed. \nReg. 8725 (2012) (brackets and internal quotation marks \n\n  Cite as:  573 U. S. ____ (2014)  5 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nomitted).  As a practical matter, the provision ensures that \nwomen  have  access  to  contraception  at  no  cost  beyond \ntheir insurance premiums.  Employers that do not comply \nwith the mandate are subject to civil penalties. \n  Recognizing that some religions disapprove of contra-\nceptives,  the  Government  has  sought  to  implement  the \nmandate  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  freedom  of \nconscience.  It  has  categorically  exempted  any  group \nhealth plan of a “religious employer,” as defined by refer-\nence to the Tax Code provision governing churches.  See  \n45 CFR §147.131(a); http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (as \nvisited July 2, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case \nfile).  And it has extended a further accommodation to  \nreligious  nonprofits  that  do  not  satisfy  the  categorical \nexemption.  All agree that Wheaton qualifies as a religious \nnonprofit.\n  To invoke the accommodation and avoid civil penalties, \na religious nonprofit need only file a self-certification form \nstating (1) that it “opposes providing coverage for some or \nall of any contraceptive services required to be covered \nunder [the regulation] on account of religious objections,” \n(2) that it “is organized and operates as a nonprofit en-\ntity,” and (3) that it  “holds itself out as a  religious organiza- \ntion.”  §147.131(b).  The form is reprinted in an appendix \nto this opinion.  Any organization that completes the form\nand provides a copy to its insurance issuer or third-party \nadministrator1 need not “contract,  arrange, pay, or refer \nfor contraceptive coverage” to which it objects.  78 Fed.  \nReg. 39874 (2013); see 29 CFR §2590.715–2713A(b)(1) and \n(c)(1).  Instead, the insurance issuer or third-party admin-\n—————— \n1Typically, an employer contracts to pay a health insurer to provide \n \ncoverage; the insurer both covers the cost of medical claims  and man-\nages  the  process  for  administering  those  claims.    Employers  who \nmaintain self-insured plans cover the cost of claims for medical treat-\nment directly.  Such employers often contract with third-party adminis-\ntrators to administer  the claims process. \n\n6  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nistrator must provide contraceptive coverage for the organ-\nization’s employees and may not charge the organization \nany premium or other fee related to those services. The\nback  of  the  self-certification  form  reminds  third-party \nadministrators that receipt of the form constitutes notice \nthat they must comply with their regulatory obligations.  \nSee Appendix, infra. \nB \n  Rather than availing itself of this simple accommoda-\ntion,  Wheaton  filed  suit,  asserting  that  completing  the \nform  and  submitting  it  to  its  third-party  administrator \nwould make it complicit in the provision of contraceptive \ncoverage,  in  violation  of  its  religious  beliefs.    On  that \nbasis, it sought a preliminary injunction, claiming that the \nlaw and regulations at issue violate RFRA, which provides \nthat  the  Government  may  not  “substantially  burden  a \nperson’s exercise of religion” unless the application of that \nburden  “is  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  [a] \ncompelling governmental interest.”  42 U. S. C. §§2000bb– \n1(a) and (b).2  \n  The District Court denied a preliminary injunction on\nthe ground that the regulations exempting Wheaton from \nthe contraceptive coverage requirement do not substan-\ntially burden its exercise of religion.  App. to Emergency\nApplication for Injunction Pending Appellate Review 1–20.  \nUnder Circuit precedent, the court reasoned, Wheaton’s \nact of “filling out the form and sending it to the [third-\nparty  administrator]”  in  no  way  “triggers”  coverage  of \ncontraception costs.  Id., at 9 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The Seventh Circuit in turn denied Wheaton’s  \nmotion for an injunction pending appeal.  See Order in No.  \n14–2396 (CA7, June 30, 2014).  In doing so, it relied on  \n—————— \n2Wheaton also raised claims under the First Amendment and the  \n \nAdministrative Procedure Act.  Because it does not press those claims \nin this Court as a basis for injunctive relief, I do not discuss them.  \n\n  Cite as:  573 U. S. ____ (2014)  7 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nthis  Court’s  pronouncement  in  Hobby  Lobby  “that  the \naccommodation provision (applicable in this case) ‘consti-\ntutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government’s \naims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.’” \n \nIbid.  \n  Wheaton applied to JUSTICE KAGAN, in her capacity as \nCircuit Justice for the Seventh Circuit, for an emergency \ninjunction against enforcement of the law and regulations \npending resolution of its legal challenge.  She referred the  \nmatter  to  the  Conference,  which  entered  a  temporary \ninjunction and called for a response from the Government.  \nSee ante, at ___.  After receipt of the Government’s re-\nsponse, the Court today enters an order granting injunc-\ntive relief. \nII   \nA  \n  I  disagree  strongly  with  what  the  Court  has  done.  \nWheaton asks us to enjoin the enforcement of a duly en-\nacted  law  and  duly  promulgated  regulations  before  the \ncourts below have passed on the merits of its legal chal-\nlenge.  Relief of this nature is extraordinary and reserved \nfor the rarest of cases.  With good reason.  The only source \nof authority for this Court to issue an injunction pending \nreview  in  the  lower  courts  is  the  All  Writs  Act,  which \nprovides that this Court “may issue all writs necessary or \nappropriate in aid of [its] . . . jurisdictio[n] and agreeable \nto the usages and principles of law.”  28 U. S. C. §1651(a).  \nThis grant of equitable power is a failsafe, “to be used \n‘sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent cir-\ncumstances.’”    Ohio  Citizens  for  Responsible  Energy,  \n \nInc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA,  J., in  \nchambers).\n  Under  our  precedents,  “[a]n  injunction  is  appropriate \nonly if (1) it is necessary or appropriate in aid of our juris-\ndiction, and (2) the legal rights  at issue are indisputably \n\n8  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nclear.”  Turner Broadcasting System,  507 U. S., at 1303  \n(brackets, internal quotation marks, and citations omit-\nted).3  To understand how high a bar that second prong is, \nconsider that this Court has previously pointed to differ-\nences of opinion among lower courts as proof positive that \nthe standard has not been met.  See Lux v. Rodrigues, 561 \nU. S.  1306,  1308  (2010)  (ROBERTS,   C. J.,  in  chambers) \n(observing that “the courts of appeals appear to be reach-\ning divergent results” respecting the applicant’s claim, and \nthat, “[a]ccordingly, . . . it cannot be said that his right to \nrelief is ‘indisputably clear’”).  Neutral application of this\n \nprinciple would compel the denial  of Wheaton’s application \nwithout any need to examine the merits, for two Courts of \nAppeals that have addressed similar claims have rejected \nthem.  See Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F. 3d 547 (CA7\n2014); Michigan Catholic Conference and Catholic Family  \nServices v.  Burwell, ___ F. 3d ___, 2014 WL 2596753 (CA6, \nJune  11,  2014).4    Remarkably,  the  Court  uses  division \n—————— \n3Indeed, some of my colleagues who act to grant relief in this case \n \nhave  themselves  emphasized  the  exceedingly  high  burden  that  an \napplicant must surmount to obtain an  interlocutory injunction under \nthe All Writs Act.  See Lux v. Rodrigues, 561 U. S. 1306, 1307 (2010)  \n(ROBERTS, C. J., in chambers) (an applicant must demonstrate that “the \nlegal rights at issue are indisputably clear” in order to obtain such \ninjunctive relief) (internal quotation marks omitted); Respect Maine  \nPAC v. McKee, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (unlike a stay of a lower court’s \norder, a request for an injunction against the enforcement of a law \n“ ‘does not simply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo but \n \ngrants judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower courts’ ”) \n \n(quoting Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v.  NRC, 479 U. S.  \n1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers)). \n4To be sure, two other Courts of Appeals have recently granted tem-\n \nporary injunctions similar to the one Wheaton seeks here.  See Order in \nEternal  Word  Television  Network,  Inc.  v.  Secretary,  U. S.  Dept.  of  \nHealth and Human Services, No. 14–12696–CC (CA11, June 30, 2014) \n(granting injunction pending appeal); Order in Diocese of Cheyenne v. \nBurwell, No. 14–8040 (CA10, June 30, 2014) (same).  Although denying \nthe injunction in this case would produce a different outcome, the \nGovernment could of course move to vacate those injunctions were we \n\n  Cite as:  573 U. S. ____ (2014)  9 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \namong the Circuits as  a justification for the issuance of its \norder,  noting  that  “division  is  a  traditional  ground  for \ncertiorari.”  Supra, at 1.  But a petition for writ of certio- \nrari is not before us.  Rather, given the posture of this appli- \ncation—for an emergency injunction under the All Writs \nAct—division of authority is reason not to grant relief. \nB \n  Wheaton’s  RFRA  claim  plainly  does  not  satisfy  our \ndemanding standard for the extraordinary relief it seeks. \n  For one thing, the merits of this case are not before this \nCourt for full review; adjudication of the merits is still \npending in the District Court.  So nothing necessitates \nintervention in order to “‘aid . . . our jurisdiction,’” Turner \n   \nBroadcasting System,  507 U. S., at 1301 (alterations omit-\nted), over any eventual certiorari petition from a decision \nrendered below.  If the Government is allowed to enforce \nthe law, either Wheaton will file the self-certification form, \nor it will not.  Either way, there will remain a live contro-\nversy that this Court could adjudicate after the case is \ndecided on the merits below.  And either way, if Wheaton \nis correct in its challenge to the law, its rights will be \nvindicated and it will obtain the relief it seeks. \n  As to the merits, Wheaton’s claim is likely to fail under \nany standard, let alone the standard that its entitlement \nto relief be “‘indisputably clear,’” ibid.  Wheaton asserts  \n   \nthat  filing  the  self-certification  form  might  ultimately\nresult  in  the  provision  of  contraceptive  services  to  its \nemployees, thereby burdening its religious exercise.  And \nit points out that if it does not file the form, it will face \ncivil penalties.  But it is difficult to understand how these \narguments make out a viable RFRA claim. \n  RFRA requires Wheaton to show that the accommoda-\n——————  \nto deny this one.  Moreover, while uniformity certainly is important,  \nuniform error  is not.  \n\n10  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \ntion process “substantially burden[s] [its] exercise of reli-\ngion.”  §2000bb–1(a).  “Congress no doubt meant the modi-\nfier ‘substantially’ to  carry weight.”   Hobby Lobby, 573  \nU. S., at ___ (GINSBURG,  J.,  dissenting) (slip op., at 20).  \nWheaton, for religious reasons, categorically opposes the \nprovision of contraceptive services.  The Government has  \ngiven it a simple means to opt out of the contraceptive \ncoverage mandate—and thus avoid any civil penalties for \nfailing  to  provide  contraceptive  services—and  a  simple \nmeans to tell its third-party administrator of its claimed \nexemption.\n  Yet Wheaton maintains that taking these steps to avail \nitself of the accommodation would substantially burden its \nreligious  exercise.  Wheaton  is  “religiously  opposed  to \nemergency contraceptives because they may act by killing \na human embryo.”  Emergency Application for Injunction \nPending Appellate Review 11.  And it “believes that au-\nthorizing its [third-party administrator] to provide these \ndrugs in [its] place makes it complicit in grave moral evil.”  \nIbid.  Wheaton is mistaken—not as a matter of religious \nfaith, in which it is undoubtedly sincere, but as a matter of\nlaw: Not every sincerely felt “burden” is a “substantial” \none, and it is for courts, not litigants, to identify which  \nare.  See Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___ (GINSBURG,  J.,  \ndissenting) (slip op., at 21–22).   Any provision of contra-\nceptive coverage by Wheaton’s third-party administrator \nwould not result from any action by Wheaton; rather, in \nevery meaningful sense, it would result from the relevant \nlaw and regulations.  The law and regulations require, in  \nessence, that some entity provide contraceptive coverage.  \nA religious nonprofit’s choice not to be that entity may \nleave someone else obligated to provide coverage instead—\nbut the obligation is created by the contraceptive coverage \nmandate imposed by law, not by the religious nonprofit’s  \n\n  Cite as:  573 U. S. ____ (2014)  11  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nchoice to opt out of it.5  \n  Let me be absolutely clear: I do not doubt that Wheaton \ngenuinely believes that signing the self-certification form \nis  contrary  to  its  religious  beliefs.    But  thinking  one’s \nreligious  beliefs  are  substantially  burdened—no  matter \nhow sincere or genuine that belief may be—does not make \nit so.  \n  An analogy used by the Seventh Circuit may help to \nexplain why Wheaton’s complicity theory cannot be legally \nsound: \n“Suppose it is wartime, there is a draft, and a Quaker \nis called up.  Many Quakers are pacifists, and their\npacifism  is  a  tenet  of  their  religion.  Suppose  the \nQuaker who’s been called up tells the selective service \nsystem that he’s a conscientious objector.  The selec-\ntive service officer to whom he makes this pitch ac-\ncepts the sincerity of his refusal to bear arms and ex-\ncuses him.  But as the Quaker leaves the selective \nservice office, he’s told: ‘you know this means we’ll \nhave to draft someone in place of you’—and the Quaker \nreplies  indignantly  that  if  the  government  does \nthat, it will be violating his religious beliefs.  Because \nhis  religion  teaches  that  no  one  should  bear  arms,  \ndrafting another person in his place would make him \nresponsible for the military activities of his replace-\nment, and by doing so would substantially burden his \nown sincere religious beliefs.  Would this mean that \nby exempting him the government had forced him to \n—————— \n5Wheaton notes that the back of the self-certification form provides \n \nthird-party administrators  with notice of their regulatory obligations.  \nSee Emergency Application for Injunction Pending Appellate Review 8; \nsee also Appendix, infra.  That notice is merely an instruction to third-\nparty administrators; it is  not a part of any of the representations \nrequired on the front of the form.  No statement to  which Wheaton \nmust assent in any way reflects agreement with or endorsement of the \nnotice.  \n\n12  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \n‘trigger’ the drafting of a replacement who was not a \nconscientious objector, and that the Religious Free-\ndom Restoration Act would require a draft exemption \nfor  both  the  Quaker  and  his  non‐Quaker  replace-\nment?”  Notre Dame, 743 F. 3d, at 556. \n  Here, similarly, the filing of the self-certification form \nmerely indicates to the third-party administrator that  a \nreligious  nonprofit  has  chosen  to  invoke  the  religious \naccommodation.  If a religious nonprofit chooses not to pay \nfor contraceptive services, it is true that someone else may \nhave a legal obligation to pay for them, just as someone \nmay have to go to war in place of the conscientious objec-\ntor.  But the obligation to provide contraceptive services, \nlike the obligation to serve in the Armed Forces, arises not \nfrom the filing of the form but from the underlying law \nand regulations. \n  It may be that what troubles Wheaton is that it must \nparticipate in any process the end result of which might be \nthe provision of contraceptives to its employees.  But that \nis far from a substantial burden on its free exercise of \nreligion. \n  Even if one were to conclude that Wheaton meets the \nsubstantial  burden  requirement,  the  Government  has \nshown that application of the burden is “the least restric-\ntive means” to further a “compelling governmental inter-\nest,”  §2000bb–1(b)(2).  The  contraceptive  coverage  re-\nquirement plainly furthers compelling interests in public \nhealth and women’s well-being.  See Hobby Lobby, ante, at \n2 (KENNEDY,  J.  concurring).  And it is the “least restrictive \nmeans” of furthering those interests.  Indeed, as justifica-\ntion  for  its  decision  in  Hobby  Lobby—issued  just  this\nweek—the very Members of the Court that now vote to \ngrant injunctive relief concluded that the accommodation \n“constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Gov-\nernment’s aims while providing  greater respect for reli-\n\n  Cite as:  573 U. S. ____ (2014)  13  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \ngious liberty.”  Ante, at 3 (majority opinion); see also ante,  \nat 4 (“The effect of the [Dept. of Health and Human Ser-\nvices (HHS)]-created accommodation on the women em-\nployed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved \nin these cases would be precisely zero.  Under that ac-\ncommodation, these women would still be entitled to all  \nFDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing”); ante,  \nat 44 (“At a minimum . . . [the accommodation] does not \nimpinge on the plaintiffs’ religious belief that providing \ninsurance  coverage  for  the  contraceptives  at  issue  here \nviolates their religion, and it serves HHS’s stated interests \nequally well”); see also ante, at 4 (KENNEDY,  J.,  concur-\nring) (“[I]t is the Court’s understanding that an accommo-\ndation may be made to the employers without imposition \nof a whole new program or burden on the Government.  As \nthe Court  makes clear, this is not a case where it can be  \nestablished that it is difficult to accommodate the govern-\nment’s interest, and in fact the mechanism for doing so is \nalready in place”).  Today’s grant of injunctive relief sim- \nply does not square with the Court’s reasoning in Hobby  \nLobby. \n  It should by now be clear just how far the Court has \nstrayed in granting Wheaton an interlocutory injunction \nagainst the enforcement of the law and regulations before \nthe courts below have adjudicated Wheaton’s RFRA claim.  \nTo warrant an injunction under the All Writs Act, the \nCourt must have more than a bare desire to suspend the \nexisting state of affairs; Wheaton’s entitlement to relief \nmust  be  indisputably  clear.    While  Wheaton’s  religious\nconviction is undoubtedly entitled to respect, it does not\ncome close to affording a basis for relief under the law. \nC \n  The  Court’s  approach  imposes  an  unwarranted  and \nunprecedented  burden  on  the  Government’s  ability  to\nadminister an important regulatory scheme.  The Execu-\n\n14  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \ntive  is  tasked  with   enforcing  Congress’  mandate  that \npreventative care be available to citizens at no cost beyond \nthat of insurance.  In providing the accommodation for \nwhich Wheaton is eligible, the Government has done a \nsalutary  thing:  exempt  religious  organizations  from  a \nrequirement that might otherwise burden them.  Wheaton  \nobjects, however, to the minimally burdensome paperwork \nnecessary  for  the  Government  to  administer  this  ac- \ncommodation.  If  the  Government  cannot  require  or- \nganizations to attest to their views by way of a simple \nself-certification form and notify their third-party admin-\nistrators of their claimed exemption, how can it ever iden-\ntify the organizations eligible for the accommodation and \nperform the administrative tasks necessary to make the \naccommodation work?  The self-certification form is the  \nleast intrusive way for the Government to administer the \naccommodation.  All that a religious organization must do \nis attest to the views that it holds and notify its third-\nparty administrator that it is exempt.  The Government  \nrightly accepts that attestation at face value; it does not \nquestion whether an organization’s views are sincere.  It is \nnot at all clear to me how the Government could adminis-\nter  the  religious  nonprofit  accommodation  if  Wheaton \nwere to prevail.\n  The Court has different ideas, however.  Stepping into \nthe shoes of HHS, the Court sets out to craft a new admin-\nistrative regime.  Its order grants injunctive relief so long \nas Wheaton “informs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices in writing that it is a non-profit organization that \nholds itself out as religious and has religious objections to \nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.”  Supra, at  \n1.  And it goes further—“[t]o meet the condition for injunc-\ntion pending appeal,” the Court continues, Wheaton “need \nnot  use  the  [self-certification]  form  prescribed  by  the \nGovernment . . . and need not send copies to health insur-\nance issuers or third-party administrators.”   Ibid.  This \n\n  Cite as:  573 U. S. ____ (2014)  15  \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nCourt  has  no  business  rewriting  administrative  regula-\ntions.  Yet, without pause, the Court essentially does just  \nthat.6  \n  It is unclear why the Court goes to the lengths it does to \nrewrite HHS’s regulations.  Presumably the Court intends \nto leave to the agency the task of forwarding whatever \nnotification it receives to the respective insurer or third-\nparty administrator.  But the Court does not even require \nthe religious nonprofit to identify its third-party adminis-\ntrator, and it neglects to explain how HHS is to identify \nthat entity.  Of course, HHS is aware of Wheaton’s third-\nparty administrator in this case.  But what  about other  \ncases?  Does the Court intend for HHS to rely on the filing \nof lawsuits by every entity claiming an exemption, such \nthat  the  identity  of  the  third-party  administrator  will \nemerge in the pleadings or in discovery?  Is HHS to under-\ntake the daunting—if not impossible—task of creating a \ndatabase that tracks every employer’s insurer or third-\n—————— \n6This case is crucially unlike Little Sisters of the Poor  v.  Sebelius, 571  \n \nU. S. ___ (2014).  There, the Court issued a comparable order “based on \nall the circumstances of the case”—in particular, the fact that the \napplicants’ third-party administrator was a “church plan” that had no \nlegal obligation or intention to provide contraceptive coverage.  See \nLittle Sisters of the Poor v.  Sebelius, 2013 WL 6839900, *10–*11, *13 (D  \nColo., Dec. 27, 2013).  As a consequence, whatever the merits of that \nunusual order, it did not affect any individual’s access  to contraceptive \ncoverage.  Not so here.  Wheaton’s third-party administrator bears the \nlegal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a \nvalid self-certification.  See 26 CFR §54.9815–2713A(b)(2) (2013); 29 \nCFR §2510.3–16(b) (2013).  Today’s injunction thus risks depriving \nhundreds of  Wheaton’s employees and students of their legal entitle-\nment  to  contraceptive  coverage.    In  addition,  because  Wheaton  is \nmaterially indistinguishable from other nonprofits that object to the \nGovernment’s accommodation, the issuance of an injunction in this case \nwill presumably entitle hundreds or thousands of other objectors to the \nsame remedy.  The Court has no reason to think that the administra-\ntive scheme it foists on the Government today is workable or effective \non a national scale. \n\n16  WHEATON COLLEGE v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  \nparty administrator nationwide?  And, putting that aside, \nwhy wouldn’t Wheaton’s claim be exactly the same under \nthe Court’s newly-fashioned system?  Either way, the end \nresult will be that a third-party administrator will provide \ncontraceptive coverage.  Surely the Court and Wheaton \nare not just objecting to the use of one stamp instead of \ntwo in order to avail itself of the accommodation. \n  The Court’s actions in this case create unnecessary costs \nand layers of bureaucracy, and they ignore a simple truth: \nThe  Government  must  be  allowed  to  handle  the  basic \ntasks of public administration in a manner that comports \nwith common sense.  It is not the business of this Court to \nensnare itself in the Government’s ministerial handling of \nits affairs in the manner it does here. \n*    *    * \n  I have deep respect for religious faith, for the important \nand  selfless  work  performed  by  religious  organizations, \nand for the values of pluralism protected by RFRA and the \nFree Exercise Clause.  But the Court’s grant of an injunc-\ntion in this case allows Wheaton’s beliefs about the effects  \nof its actions to trump the democratic interest in allowing \nthe Government to enforce the law.  In granting an injunc-\ntion  concerning  this  religious  nonprofit  accommodation, \nthe availability of which served as the premise for the \nCourt’s decision in Hobby Lobby,  the Court cannot possibly \nbe applying our longstanding requirement that a party’s \nentitlement to relief be indisputably clear. \n  Our jurisprudence has over the years drawn a careful \nboundary between majoritarian democracy and the right \nof every American to practice his or her religion freely.  \nWe should not use the extraordinary vehicle of an injunc-\ntion under the All Writs Act to work so fundamental a \nshift in that boundary.  Because Wheaton cannot justify\nthe  relief  it  seeks,  I  would  deny  its  application  for  an \ninjunction,  and  I  respectfully  dissent  from  the  Court’s  \nrefusal to do so. \n\n  Cite as:  573 U.

Sebelius, 743 \nF.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014).2  After careful consideration of the expedited briefing [64, 68, 71] and \nsupplemental authority [69] on  Plaintiff’s motion, the Court  respectfully disagrees.  In \nrecognition of the difficult circum stances in which Plaintiff finds itself, the Court issues this \nabbreviated opinion setting forth in summary fashion its reas ons for denying Plaintiff’s m otion \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 The Court is aware that Plaintiff has filed a notice  of appeal of the June 23 order. See Seventh Circuit \nCase No. 14-2396.  The Court understands Plaintiff to have appealed under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), not § \n1291.  Accordingly, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c) suggests that the Co urt may rule on a motion \nseeking reconsideration of its prior or der denying injunctive relief.  In addit ion, Plaintiff has invoked \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8 in bringing its alternative request for an injunction pending appeal \nto the district court in the first instance. \n\t\n2 Plaintiff also contends that the Court need not consider  Notre Dame controlling because the panel itself \ndescribed its discussion of the  merits of the university’s claim as “tentative.”  In this Court’ s view, the \nCourt of Appeals used “tentative” to emphasize that its views were subject to being revisited on a fuller \nrecord – gi ven that the “ evidentiary record [was] virtually a b lank.”   Notre Dame, 743  F.3d at  552.  \nHowever, this Court does  not read the panel’s decision as expressing a “tentative” view of the law as it \napplies to the facts of record at the time.  In considering Plaintiff’s claims here, this Court has endeavored \nto point  out sim ilarities and differences in the  state of the record, but conc ludes that Plaintiff’ s \ncircumstances are not dist inguishable from Notre Dame’s in a  way that would allow Plaintiff to escape  \nNotre Dame’s controlling ambit.  \n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 72 Filed: 06/30/14 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:26611\nso that Plaintiff m ay promptly seek em ergency relief in the Seven th Circuit if Plaintiff so \nchooses. \n \nIn regard to Plaintiff’s second “direct path ” argument – namely, its “compelled speech” \nclaim – the Court stan ds by the analysis in  its June 23 Order [62 at 15-17] and has nothing \nfurther to add at this time. \n \nPlaintiff’s first “direct path” argum ent on what Plaintiff calls the “gag rule” im posed by \nthe ACA’s implementing regulations requires a longer discussion.  At the status hearing held on \nJune 24, the Court asked the parties to address more  of the specifics in re gard to what Plaintiff \nwanted to say and whether Defendants would a ttempt to stop Plain tiff from speaking as it \ndesires.  At that tim e, and subsequently in  its briefs on the reconsid eration motion, Plaintiff \nspelled out with specificity the m essage that  it wishes to convey ag ainst the contraceptive \nmandate and both its and its TPA’s perceived ro le in carrying it out.   Government counsel \nstressed, both orally and in wr iting, that the Governm ent does  not believe that its regulations \nrestrict speech; rather, all that  is restricted (in the Government ’s view) is cert ain conduct that \ndoes not warrant First Amendment protection in any event.  As example, the Government cites to \na labor case involv ing the exten t to which an  employer can lawfully ex press its opposition to \nefforts to unionize.  [68 at 8] (citing NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 617-18 (1969)).   \n \nIn posing the questions that it  asked counsel to address both  at the status hearing and i n \ntheir briefs, the Court was attempting to pin down the extent to which the parties disagree on the \nscope of permissible speech and/or conduct under the regulations.  Both the Government and the \ncourts are obliged, if at all possible, to construe statutes and regulations in a manner that avoids \nconstitutional infirmities.  See,  e.g., Chowdhury v. Ashcroft, 241 F.3d 848, 853 (7th Cir. 2001) \n(“Just as we would construe a statute in a way th at avoids a constitutio nal problem, if that is \nfairly possible, both we and the  Board should interpret and apply administrative procedures in a \nway that avoids constitutional issues.”)  In addition, it is well established that “an administrative \nagency may be influenced by cons titutional considerations in the way  it in terprets or applies \nstatutes.”   Branch v. FCC , 824 F.3d 37, 47 (D.C.  Cir. 1987) (Bork, J.).  Furtherm ore, the \nSupreme Court has explained that courts m ust give some deference to agency constructions of \nregulations, even if the agency’s explanation is set forth in a brief, as is the case here.  See  Auer \nv. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461-63 (1997).  As in Auer, given the steady stream of litigation across \nthe country on the very issues now before this  Court and the attention that the issue undoubtedly \nis receiving at the highest levels of the relevant executive branch departments, “[t]here is simply \nno reason to suspect th at the inte rpretation does not reflect the ag ency’s fair an d considered \njudgment on the m atter in question.”   Id. at 62.  In these circum stances, the Court finds it \nappropriate to consider the Governm ent’s or al and w ritten statem ents as providing its \nconstruction of ambiguous language in a regulation.   As the Supreme Court has stressed, “[a] \nrule requiring the Secretary to construe his ow n regulations narrowly woul d make little sense, \nsince he is free to write the regulations as br oadly as he wishes, subject only to the lim its \nimposed by the statute. ”  Id. at 63.  And there is no reason  to think that the Secretary cannot \nconstrue (and likewise could not rewrite) the existing regulations to narrow their scope as well.3 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n3 Plaintiff contends that deference to the Govern ment’s proffered  construction of the regulation is not  \nappropriate in this instance because the regulation is not ambiguous, and thus the Government is engaged \nin “creating  de facto a new regulation.”  The Court respectfully  disagrees.  The critical ter ms in the \n2 \n\t\n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 72 Filed: 06/30/14 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:26612\n  The upshot of the foregoing analysis is th at, on the current reco rd, the Court is not \npersuaded to issue a prelim inary injunction proh ibiting the Government from interfering with \nPlaintiff’s First Amendment rights.  As the C ourt reads the Governm ent’s representations, the \nGovernment will step in  only if Plaintiff engage s in conduct that is not protected by  the First \nAmendment.  Should that reading be inaccurate as the case moves forward, Plaintiff m ay return \nat once to seek appropriate relief. \n \n  In addition, at least for  present purposes, it is worth no ting tha t even if  (a ) the \nGovernment and the Court were no t obligated to construe the regulation to avoid constitutional \nproblems and (b) the Court cou ld not accept  the narrowing cons truction s et out in  the \nGovernment’s brief, the Court would not be in pos ition to enter the broad injunctive relief that \nPlaintiff seeks at this time in any event.  For, when a portion of a statute or regulation is found to \nbe constitutionally infirm, there is a presum ption that the offending portion can be severed from \nthe remainder unless Congress or the agency provided evidence to the contrary.  See, e.g., Regan \nv. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. 641, 653 (1984).  Here, the Court  sees no indication that the regulation \nbarring organizations like Plaintiff from seeking to “interfere with” or “influence” their TPP was \nso fundamental to the overall scheme as to be non-severable if it were infirm. \n \n  Finally, today’s decisions in  Hobby Lobby and Conestoga do not provide any basis for  \nthis Court either to grant reconsideration or an injunction pending appeal.  Although the Justices \ndiscussed the accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious objections (see Burwell \nv. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , --- U.S. ---, s lip op. at 43 -44 (opinion of the Co urt); id. at 3 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring); id. at 29-30 & n.27 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)), the Court expressly did \nnot “decide today whether an app roach of this  type com plies with RFRA for purposes of all \nreligious claims” (id. at 44 (opinion of the Court); see also  id. at 10 n.9).  Most significantly for  \ntoday’s purposes, at least in the district court,  nothing in the Supreme Court’s ruling expressly \noverrules or abrogates  Notre Dame, which thus rem ains binding on this  Court.  It is solely the  \nprovince of the Seventh Circuit to decide whether to revisit  Notre Dame today or at any other \ntime in the future in light of new guidance from the Supreme Court and/or to issue an injunction \npending appeal for that or any other reason.   Cf. Gacy v. Wellborn, 994 F.2d 305, 310 (7th Cir. \n1993) (“A district judge who thi nks that new evidence or better  argument ‘refutes’ one of our \ndecisions should report his conclusions while applying the existing law of the circuit.”); Todd v. \nSociete Bic, S.A., 21 F.3d 1402, 1415 (7th Cir. 1994) (Flaum, J ., dissenting) (“In a hierarchical \njudiciary, judges of inferi or courts may not limit de cisions of superior cour ts.”).  To the extent \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nregulation – “interfere” and “influence” – have many definitions and could be read narrowly, broadly, or \nanywhere in between.  As noted abo ve, both the Government and the courts  are obliged  to give those \nterms a construction that would avoid constitutional infirmity.  Although it is impossible to set out precise \nboundaries, the First Amendment jurisprudence is abundant and the Government must be careful to give \nPlaintiff the First Amendment breathi ng space to  which it is entitled.  The labor case t o which the  \nGovernment cites in its leading example of conduc t that may  not be enti tled to First  Amendment \nprotection does not provide a perfect analogy – the TPAs likely are in far different circumstances than the \nemployees seeking to unionize for the first time, in  that the market for the TPAs’ services likely would \nenable Plaintiff’ s TPA to surviv e a  decision by Plaintiff to take  its business else where while the  \nemployees in  Gissel Packing faced a  much stronger incentive to  knuckle under to  their employer’s \npressure.  Regardless, the existing law provides myriad First Amendment decisions on which the parties  \ncan rely in shaping their conduct and the courts are available to mediate any disputes on that score. \n3 \n\t\n\nCase: 1:13-cv-08910 Document #: 72 Filed: 06/30/14 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:26613\nthat Plaintiff believes that th e circumstances are appropriate for an injunction pending appeal, \nsuch as that granted by the Supreme Court in Little Sisters of the Poor or by the Third Circuit last \nweek in the case submitted by Plaintiff as supplemental authority, Plaintiff must ask the Seventh \nCircuit for that relief, as this Court is bound to apply Notre Dame as it stands. \n \n \n\t\n\t\nDated:  June 30, 2014            \n       ______________________________ \n       Robert  M.

Dow\nThe following is before the court: WHEATON COLLEGE’S EMERGENCY\nMOTION FOR INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL - RELIEF REQUESTED BY\nJUNE 30, 2014, filed on June 26, 2014, by counsel for Appellant Wheaton College. \nOn the basis of this court's decision in Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir.\n2014), we believe that the appellant has not shown that it is likely to prevail on the\nmerits. And the decision today by the United States Supreme Court in Burwell v.\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., ---U.S.---, slip op. (June 30, 2014), emphasizes that the\naccommodation provision (applicable in this case) \"constitutes an alternative that\nachieves all of the Government's aims while providing greater respect for religious\nliberty.\" Id. at 3.\n\nNo. 14-2396                                                                                                                       Page 2\nIT IS ORDERED that the emergency motion for injunction pending appeal is\ntherefore DENIED.\nform name: c7_Order_3J(form ID: 177)",
