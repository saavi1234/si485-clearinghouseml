Bryant, Lewis Devon Bridges, Angela Showers, Eric Bridges and Lesonya Bryant, are \n  black minor residents of Lawrence County and are students enrolled in the schools of the Lawrence County School \nDistrict. The suit is brought by their parents and next friends, Eugene Bryant, Lewis Bridges, Billy Showers, Amos \nBridges and Willie Lee Funches. \nThe United States investigated the allegations raised in plaintiff-intervenors’ complaint and is negotiating with \nLawrence County to resolve issues regarding employment and student transfer policies which, in the opinion of the \nUnited States, violate the 1969 orders. The United States did not participate in the trial. \n \n4  The defendant proposes to use the bond issue proceeds to construct a new air-conditioned elementary school at \n  Monticello; a new vocational-technical center on the Monticello High School campus; a new air-conditioned \nclassroom  at  New  Hebron;  new  class rooms,  band  hall,  kitchen  and  cafetorium  at Topeka-Tilton;  and  new \nclassrooms at Beulah Williams. \n \n5  In its opinion, the Fifth Circuit stated: \n \nWe are unable to determine whether [the 1974 order] meant that the school district was on the way to \ndischarging its constitutional duty by complying with the court orders or whether at that time it had fulfilled its \nconstitutional duty to disestablish the dual system. \nThe Fifth Circuit’s opinion stated that, if the school system were not unitary, the building program and the Board’s \nplan should have been designed “to promote integration rather than to avoid reinstating segregation.” (emphasis \noriginal). But see Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 21, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1278–79, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 \n(1971) (non-unitary school obligated to “see to it that further school construction and abandonment is not used and \ndoes not serve to perpetuate or re-establish the dual system); Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Ed., 584 F.2d 78, 81 (5th \nCir.1978) (non-unitary school has duty “to take no actions which would reinstitute a dual school system ...”); United \nStates v. Lawrence County School District, 5th Cir., 1969 order (“All school construction, school consolidation and \nsite selection ... shall be done in a manner which will prevent the recurrence of the dual school structure ...”). \n \n6  Plaintiff-intervenors, prior to trial, filed a motion for certification of class. By agreement of the parties, the motion is \n  held in abeyance. \n \n7  The defendant offered no reason for the closing of the Silver Creek school which, before it was destroyed by fire, \n  was located near Beulah Williams. Plaintiff-intervenors apparently do not object to the closing. \n \n8  The defendant has never sought approval of any of these deviations from the court-ordered plan and apparently \n  does not do so now. \n \n9  Plaintiff-intervenors contend that New Hebron, which has a 35.5% black student body, is racially identifiable. The \n  percentage of black students at New Hebron, however, varies by only 8.3 percentage points from the district-wide \nratio. In his opinion of June 25, 1984, Judge Russell stated that “[t]he school which was traditionally white, New \nHebron, remains so ...,” relying on enrollment figures at New Hebron for the 1982–83 school year. At that time New \n  5 \n \n\nHebron was only 31.8% black. \n \n10  According to the October 1985 report to the court, the racial populations of the county schools were as follows: \n \n  Black  White  % Black \n     \nMonticello High  175  180  49.3 \n       \nMcCullough Jr. High  351  328  51.7 \n       \nMonticello Elementary  304  234  56.5 \n       \nNew Hebron  172  313  35.5 \n       \nTopeka Tilton  51  443  10.3 \n       \nBeulah Williams  164  66  71.3 \n       \n       \nTOTAL-DISTRICT  1217  1564  43.8 \n       \n11   The court recognizes that, while such factors are to be considered in formulating a desegregation plan, “they do not \n  work to relieve the Board of its constitutional responsibilities.” Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Bd., 721 F.2d \n1425, 1435 (5th Cir.1983). \n \n12    % Black-1970  % Black-1985 \n \n   \nMonticello High  50.6  49.3 \n     \nMcCullough  46.6  51.7 \n  6 \n \n\n     \nMonticello Elementary  38.9  56.5 \n     \nNew Hebron  38.3  35.5 \n     \nTopeka Tilton  19.2  10.3 \n     \nBeulah Williams  48.4  71.3 \n     \n     \nTOTAL DISTRICT  41.3  43.7 \n     \n13   Since Judge Russell ordered compliance with the zone lines, the proportion of whites at New Hebron has already \n  decreased by 3.7 percentage points, bringing the black-white ratio at the school nearer to that of the district. \n \n14  Judge Russell’s May 18, 1970 opinion rejecting a consolidation plan found that the preservation of New Hebron and \n  Topeka Tilton \npreserved these two schools as the heart of their respective communities, affords a closer relationship between \nthe school and their patrons, eliminates increased travel time up to an added hour and one-half per day for many \nstudents, and permits a broader base for student participation in class and team effort than afforded by one high \nschool. \nThis court acknowledges that neighborhood schools promote “worthy community values”, but its approval of the \npresent attendance zones is based on the plan’s effectiveness in furthering the “constitutional imperative of \ndesegregation.” Valley v. Rapides Parish School Bd., 702 F.2d 1221, 1229 (5th Cir.1983). \n \n15  Plaintiff-intervenors’ complaint sought strict enforcement of the present zone lines. \n \nDefendant’s argument that the doctrine of res judicata bars litigation of plaintiff-intervenors’ claims regarding \nconsolidation requires little discussion as it is without merit. A school district has a continuing obligation to seek \nmeans of eradicating the vestiges of a dual system, a duty which may not be satisfied by rigorous adherence to a \nprevious court order. See Taylor v. Quachita Parish School Bd., 648 F.2d 959, 968 n. 10 (5th Cir.1981). Bronson v. \nBoard of Ed., 525 F.2d 344 (6th Cir.1975) does not hold otherwise as it deals with a previous finding that the school \ndistrict was not in violation of the constitution and not with the question of remedy which is at issue here. \n \n16  Superintendent  Deavers  testified  that  the  state  would  not  fund  the  duplicative  bussing  involved  in  partial \n \n  7 \n \n\nconsolidation. \n \n17  Superintendent Deavers testified that the Board considered total consolidation of the system and consolidation of \n  the high schools but found the cost of additional facilities and bussing to be prohibitive. The Board also considered a \nplan for two county schools, one on either side of the Pearl River, but determined that such a plan would result in \nsevere racial imbalance. \n \n18  In  Tasby,  the school superintendent stated  that race was considered  by the board but that the overriding \n  consideration in developing the construction plan was providing facilities for students in the established attendance \nzones. The Fifth Circuit found this to be inadequate because the zones had been previously used to implement the \n“neighborhood school concept” which resulted in perpetuation of the vestiges of a dual school system. Tasby, 517 \nF.2d at 106. Therefore, because race was merely a factor and not the overriding consideration in the deliberations of \nthe Lawrence County School Board, that Board did not satisfy its constitutional obligations as set out in Tasby and \nthe plan must be reviewed by this court under the proper standard. \n \n19  In addition to this responsibility, the Board was also bound by the school construction provision of the 1969 orders, \n  the relevant text of which is reprinted at footnote 5. \n \n20  Plaintiff intervenors stipulated that the present Monticello Elementary School is in poor condition and should be \n  replaced, but presented evidence, without objection by defendants, that renovation of the present facility should be \nconsidered. The evidence showed overwhelmingly that the location of Monticello Elementary School, which is \ncomprised of four unconnected buildings, at the intersection of two major roadways in downtown Monticello \nprovides a poor and unsafe educational environment to the point of interfering with proper operation of the school. \nAdditionally, the present buildings do not qualify for insurance required by the state. \nPlaintiff-intervenors also object to defendant’s proposal to build the Vocational Technical Center on the Monticello \nHigh campus, but offered no evidence on that point. Final site selection for the center has not been made. \n \n21  According to Mississippi Highway Department plans, the land may soon be traversed by a highway. The District’s \n  architect has developed plans, however, which allow for the building in the event the highway is constructed across \nthe property. \n \n22  Defendant offered affidavits of owners of the sites proposed by plaintiff-intervenors stating that the sites are not for \n  sale. One of the landowners stated by affidavit dated December 12, 1985 that he was unwilling to sell and by \naffidavit offered by plaintiff-intervenors that he was. Neither party attempted to explain the conflict and the court \ncannot conclude that the land was actually available for sale. Even if the owner were willing to sell when the District \nneeded to purchase the property, the court is of the opinion that selection of that location would not further \ndesegregation any more than the site chosen. Plaintiff-intervenors have not provided the court with sufficient facts \nfrom which to find the desegregative superiority of their choice. The court is influenced by the fact that the subzone \nwhich Monticello Elementary serves is not large or densely populated. \n  8 \n \n\n \n23  The factors considered by this court are those considered by the court in Brewer, 397 F.2d at 42 which was cited \n  with approval by the Fifth Circuit in Tasby, 517 F.2d at 105–06. The court approved similar factors in Copeland v. \nLincoln Parish School Bd., 598 F.2d 977, 981 (5th Cir.1979). \n \n24  Deavers testified that the Board makes repairs depending on the need and available funding and does not \n  discriminate against any schools. \nPlaintiff-intervenors also argue that the defendant discriminates against predominantly or historically black schools \nin the funding of curriculum enhancements. Until this suit was initiated, Beulah Williams did not offer band, chorus \nor gifted programs which are provided through most of the other schools. Whatever the reason for the previous \ninequity in programming, the enriched curriculum is now in place at Beulah Williams and presumably will continue. \nIt should be noted that the students at Beulah Williams, which is over 70% black, consistently score higher on the \nCalifornia Achievement Test than other students in the county. \n \n25  Plaintiff-intervenors contend that the district is creating excess capacity to ensure continued use of the present \n  configuration of schools in the county. Dr. William B. Field visited the schools and concluded that most of the \nclassroom space to be added by 1984 bond issue proceeds is unnecessary. Because Field’s data relied on having the \nmaximum number of students in each class all day without considering the necessity or advantages of smaller \nclasses, the court finds that usable capacity does not substantially exceed the district’s needs. Both Dr. Field and Dr. \nMichael Stolee, a desegregation expert, recommended different scheduling methods to make more efficient use of \navailable capacity. The court is of the opinion that decisions regarding scheduling are educational questions and, to \nthe extent they are severable from constitutional issues, are best left to the discretion of the District. Furthermore, \nthe use of stored capacity for a segregative purpose presupposes that families of a particular race will move into the \nzone from other parts of the county to take advantage of the excess capacity, evidence of which was not presented. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  9 \n ",

Carr v.

The report does not even suggest that anyone could \nconsider McCullough racially identifiable. \n \n5  The district court expressly stated that the defendants’ reliance on the doctrine of res judicata was without merit \n  because “[a] school district has a continuing obligation to seek means of eradicating the vestiges of a dual system, a \n  27 \n \n\n \nduty which may not be satisfied by rigorous adherence to a previous court order.” (emphasis in original) (citation \nomitted). \n \n6  The district court found that the “geographic separation of the races was not shown to be caused by any prior \n  discriminatory acts on the part of the defendant.” Without so much as an allusion to the record or the district \ncourt’s contrary finding, the majority says that “the very demographic factors that separate residential areas by race \nare in part a vestige of past segregative practices by the Board, for it is patent that in the de jure segregation era, \nschools were built to accomodate students by race in areas where a single race predominated and reasonably \ninferrable that, as a result, parents then chose to reside near the racially segregated neighborhood schools.” I do not \nknow how we know this. Such plausible assumptions about social phenomena are not the certain stuff of judicial \nnotice. Because we are not a legislative committee, our sources must come from the record. The pronouncement \nthat “We know” is bereft of content, not worthy of consideration, and is no answer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  28 \n ",
