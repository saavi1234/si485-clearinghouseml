Based on an evaluation of the information and data provided by the District. the \nUnited States advised Lhe District that, in its view, the District has fulfi lied its affirmative \ndesegregation obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable federal law, entitling \nthe District to a declaration of unitary status.  As indicated by the signatures of counsel below, \nthe parties respectfully request that the Court approve this Agreed Order of Dismissal, declaring \nthat the District has achieved unitary \"tatus and dismissing this case\" \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis school desegregation suit was initiated by the United States against The Union \nPublic School District and several other Mississippi school districts on July 9,1970, On the \nsame day, the District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered an order requiring \nthe United States and the Union Public School District to collaboratively prepare a desegregation \n/67'-\nVI-\n<f'3 \nP,A2 \n\nj -(lJlJ  r. UUJ/UUb  I'-tl~b \nplllIl for the Disnict.  The district court subsequently approved the parties' proposed \ndesegregation plan and in:orporated the plan in an order entered on September 11, 1970 \n(\"desegregation order\").  The desegregation order required the closure of the all-black school in \nthe District and directed the District to assign all students to one consolidated school system.  In \npertinent part, the desegregation order also included provisions mmdating equitable faculty \nassignment, transportation, facilities, and participation in extracurricular activities. \nIn 2006, to assess the status of the District's deseb'Tegation efforts, the United States \ninitiated a review of the case, eliciting information from the District regarding student \nassignment, inter-district transfers, faculty and staff assignment, facilities, extracurricular \nactivities, and transportation.  The United States also considered U.S. Census and other historical \ndata relating to Union Public School District. \nII.  STIPULATED FACTS \nStudent Assignment:  Pric.r to 1970, the District operated three schools: Union High \nSchool (grades 8-(2), Union Elementary School (1-7), and Carver Elementary (1-8).  Union High \nand Elementary Schools enrolled only white srudents, and Carver Elementary School enrolled \nonly black students.  The District transferred black high school students to Boler High School in \nDecatur, Mississippi.  After the desegregation order, however, the District enrolled all of its \nstudents in a single, integrated school system (i.e., one elementary, middle, and high school), As \nihe following table illustrates, the District has since mair,tained stable enrollment: \n1970-71  623 (70%)  267 (30%)  o  890 \n1978-79  571  (72%)  218(28%)  o  789 \n1989-90  595 (69.3%)  257 (30.0%)  6 (0.7%)  858 \n2005-06  604 (70.2%)  248 (28.8%)  9 (1.0%)  861 \n2 \n~JG-30-2007  04:55  P.0.3 \n\nAUGc30-I007  01:56PM  FROM-\n.' \nJlacultylStaff Assignment:  The  desegregation  order mandated  racially  proportional \nassignment of faculty and stafflo all District schools and forbade the use ofrace as a factor in future \nfaculty  and  staff employment  decisions.  The  District subsequently  has  eliminated racially \nidentifiable personnel assignment  To illustrate this compliance, tlie following table reports the \nnumber of faculty and staff employed by the District as of August 2006: \nPrincipals  0  2 (100%)  2 \nTeachers  2 (4%)  52 (96%)  54 \nCertified Staff  0  3 (l00%)  3 \nNon-Certified Staff  11 (25%)  33 (75%)  44 \nTOTAL  13 (13%)  90 (87%)  103 \nTransportation:  The desegregation order requires that the District design bus routes \"to \ninsure the participation of all e:igible pupils on a non-segregated and otherwise non-discriminatory \nbasis:\" The District now operates an integrated student transportation system, bussing students of \nall races together. \nExtra-Curricular Activities: As mandated by the desegregation order, the District provides \nall students an equal  opportunity to pa:cticipMe in 5P-:lrts, ztudent government, extra-curricular \nactivities, and other programs. \nFacilities:  There  IS  no  evidence  lhat  the  District  operates  any school  facility  in  a \ndiscriminatory manner. \n3 \nP.04 \n\n\"\"\"b ....  ~'''. I \nIII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nThe stondard ~stablished by the Supreme Court for determining whether aschool disuicl has \nachieved Wlitary status, thus warranting termination of judicial supervision, is: (I) whethcr the \nschool district has fully and satisfactorily complied with The court's desegregation orders for a \nreasonable period of time; (2) whether the school district has eliminated The vestiges of past de jure \ndiscrimination to the extent practicable; and (3) whether the school disuict has demonstrated a good \nfaith commitment to the whole of the court's order and to those provisions of the law ond the \nConstitution that predicated judicial intervention.  See Missouri v,  Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 87-89 \n(1995); Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491-92, 498 (1992); Bd. ofEduc. of Okla. City Pub. Schs. \nv. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237,248-50 (1991). \nThe Supreme Court has identified six areas, commonly known as the \"Green factors,\" which \nmust be addressed to evaluate whether a school district has fulfilled its duties and eliminated vestiges \nof the prior dual school system to the extent practicable: (1) student assignment; (2) faculty; (3) staff; \n(4) transportation; (5) extracurricular activities; and, (6) facilities.

The Green factors, however, \nare not intended to be a \"rigid framework\"; the Stl.preme Court has also approved consideration of \nother indicia, such as \"quality of education,\" \"':; import.allt fac:ors in determining whether the District \nhas satisfied its desegregation obligations. ~ee Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93. \nBased on the information provided by the District and the surrounding facts, this Court \nconcludes that the District has fully and satisfactorily complied with the Court's desegregation orders \nfor a reasonable period oftime, and has eliminated the vestiges of past de jtue discrimination to the \nextent practicable.  Freeman, 503 U. S. at 491-92, 498.

The \nCourt thus concludes that the Union Public School District has met  its  legal  obligations for a \ndeclaration of unitary status and is entiLied to dismissal of this action. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that all prior injunctions in this case are DISSOLVED, \njurisdiction is TERMINATED, and this case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \n-u.;  /.lb\"lA;} \nENTERED THIS  2'-1  DAY OF ---v----~' 2007. \nUNIT~CT \nJUDGE \nAPPROVED: \nFOR THE UNITED STATES:  FOR  THE  UNION  PUBLIC  SCHOOL \nDISTRlCT: \nKIM \nWAN 1. \nAssistant Attorney General \ne~ \nJE~L1s;Jz=:--\n-, \nREX GORDdJ-iNr -JR-.,-E-SQ-.---\nAMY 1.
