    "summary": "<p>This is a school desegregation case arising out of Starkville, Mississippi. Plaintiffs, black students and their families, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi and alleged that Starkville maintained a dual educational system that was segregated on the basis of race. They sought injunctive relief from the court to eliminate the dual system. </p><p>The case was first filed in 1969 as <i>Bell v. Starkville Municipal School District</i>, and given the docket number 69-37a. The claims against the City of Starkville and Oktibbeha County were severed into two discrete cases: <i>Harris v. Oktibbeha County School District</i> and <i>Montgomery v. Starkville Separate School District</i>. </p><p>On August 7, 1969, District Judge Orma R. Smith entered an order directing Starkville to prepare a desegregation plan to be filed with the court for the 1970-71 school year. This plan was disapproved by Judge Smith and Starkville was instructed to submit a new plan in January 1970. Permanent injunctive relief was granted to the plaintiffs in February 1970. The court ordered that Starkville officials work to immediately begin operating a unitary school system as required by the Supreme Court in <i>Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education</i>, 396 U.S. 19 (1969) and <i>Carter v. West Feliciana School Board</i>, 396 U.S. 290 (1970). Prior to this date, Starkville had two high schools (one white and one black), two junior high/middle schools (one white and one black), and four elementary schools (two white and two black). The teachers and school administrators were also almost completely segregated. After this order, students and faculty in Starkville were reassigned to achieve desegregation. </p><p>According to a 1987 opinion, the plaintiffs asked the court for additional injunctive relief approximately a year after desegregation commenced. The plaintiffs asked that Starkville file semi-annual reports with the court to monitor Starkville's compliance with the 1970 order. This motion was sustained on November 29, 1971. </p><p>There was an additional case filed in the Northern District of Mississippi in 1971 related to this matter entitled <i>Armstead v. Starkville Municipal Separate School District</i>, which dealt with Starkville's discrimination against its black teachers. Relief was granted to the teachers and Starkville was ordered to stop its discriminatory practices of denying black teachers reemployment at a higher rate than their white peers. 325 F. Supp. 560 (N.D. Miss. 1971). </p><p>Starkville filed a motion to dissolve the injunctions in 1978. This motion was withdrawn by Starkville three years later after the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) withheld complete approval of the system. OCR got involved with the case after the NAACP filed a complaint with them in 1979 and alleged that Starkville's student grouping practices were being used to maintain a dual education system. After the complaint was filed, OCR recommended a number of changes that were implemented by Starkville. As a result, OCR cleared Starkville of all claims brought in the NAACP complaint in 1982. </p><p>The plaintiffs filed another request for relief in 1983 and alleged that Starkville had not achieved a unitary school system. (At this point the case was given a new docket number, 1:83-cv-00293-MPM.) District Judge L.T. Senter, Jr. held that the plaintiffs did not establish that Starkville teachers were unequally compensated based on race; plaintiffs did not establish that Starkville has dismissed or demoted teachers based on race; plaintiffs did not establish that Starkville recruited new teachers based on race; Starkville did not maintain a dual system through its practice of achievement grouping even though its use of achievement grouping was deemed to be statistically abnormal; and Starkville's program for creative students was not discriminatory. However, the court held that Starkville did not rebut an inference of discrimination in a program for gifted students. As a result, the court ordered that Starkville create new entrance requirement procedures for this program and the court had to approve the procedures before they were implemented. 665 F. Supp. 487 (N.D. Miss. 1987). </p><p>The plaintiffs then appealed the district court's decision to the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision and held that Starkville's achievement grouping system and gifted programs were not discriminatory. 854 F.2d 127 (5th Cir. 1988). Attorneys' fees were awarded to the plaintiffs in the amount of $23,537.50 in 1989. The plaintiffs also received expert witness fees for $8707.17 for a total award of $32,244.67. The parties cross-appealed, but later dismissed their motions.</p><p>In 1988, the United States intervened in a case against Oktibbeha County School District. The United States interpleaded Starkville because there were allegations that Starkville was allowing students living in the Oktibbeha County School District to jump district lines and attend school in Starkville. Starkville was dismissed from the case by Judge Senter after discovery turned up no proof that these allegations were true. The United States continued to be involved in the case as of March 2017. </p><p>Starkville submitted annual reports to the court throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. On November 14, 2014, Starkville filed a joint motion with the Oktibbeha County School District to consolidate their desegregation cases. The Mississippi State Legislature passed a law mandating that the two school districts be consolidated, so the districts wanted their cases consolidated in order to submit a joint desegregation plan so the districts could continue to be in compliance with their respective desegregation orders. This motion was granted by District Judge Michael P. Mills on January 14, 2015. </p><p>On March 17, 2015, the districts filed a motion for the court to approve their desegregation plan for the new, consolidated school district. The parties, working with the U.S. Department of Justice, submitted a joint desegregation order for the consolidated school district. The desegregation order assigned students to schools within the new Starkville-Oktibbeha Consolidated School District, set out provisions for faculty and would assignments, described how school construction/site selection will be carried out to prevent a recurrence of a dual school system, contained transportation provisions describing bus transportation within the district, implemented a majority-to-minority transfer policy, described inter-district transfer policies, addressed integration of extracurricular activities, established a biracial advisory committee, pledged to use Mississippi State Department of Education screening guidelines to identify academically gifted students, and agreed to continue filing annual reports with the court. Judge Mills approved this desegregation order on July 13, 2015.</p><p>An amended desegregation order was signed by Judge Mills on March 3, 2016. It included many provisions similar to the 2015 order, but expanded some of its provisions and added details about how the parties would resolve disputes amongst themselves before seeking the court's assistance and how the court would continue to monitor the case until the district achieved unitary status. </p><p>Since then, yearly reports were submitted on behalf of the Starkville Municipal Separate School District on June 22, 2016, June 30, 2017, and June 29, 2018, in compliance with the 2015 desegregation order. The reports included the following information for all public schools operated by the District:</p><p>1. The total number and percentage of students, by race/ethnicity and grade level,  assigned to each school. </p><p>2. Information on class enrollment for each classroom and its demographics</p><p>3. The total number and information of students who have requested intra-district transfers</p><p>4. The total number and percentage of teachers and administrators, by race/ethnicity and position, assigned to each school</p><p>5. The total number and percentage of non-certified staff, by race/ethnicity and position, assigned to each school. </p><p>6. The total number and percentage of employees, by race/ethnicity and position, assigned to the central office. </p><p>7. For all hiring: the vacancy filled (i.e., position, school), the date of the hiring decision, and the race of the individual hired. </p><p>8. A brief description of any present or proposed plan to site or construct new facilities or expand existing facilities and the projected racial impact of the proposal. </p><p>9. Information on whether the transportation system in the Consolidated District was desegregated to the extent that black and white students are transported daily on the same buses. </p><p>10. Copies of yearbooks for each school in the District if applicable</p><p>11. Whether there was a Biracial Advisory Committee, and information on the Committee</p><p>As of 2019, the case is ongoing.</p><p><u>Available Opinions</i></p><p>Montgomery v. Starkville Mun.

House Bill 716.  The legislation established a seven-member Commission on Starkville \nConsolidated School District Structure (the “Commission”) to review the existing structure of the \ntwo districts and to recommend “future actions for the provision and transition of services of the \nconsolidated school district in order to improve both the quality of education and the efficiency \nwith which it is delivered.”  Id.  \nOn January 24, 2014, the Commission filed its Report to the Governor of Mississippi, the \nMississippi Legislature, and the Mississippi Board of Education (the “Report”).

That proposed order was filed on July 7, 2015.  [25].  The United States \nexpressly reserved and did not waive any objections that it raised in its Response.  [20].

[25]. \n  On July 13, 2015, the Court approved a desegregation order for SOCSD to govern the \nConsolidated District for the 2015-16 school year.  [26].  Since the entry of that order, the Parties \nhave worked in good faith to develop a desegregation plan for the Consolidated District.

Background \n  On February 5, 1970, and February 6, 1970, this Court entered orders requiring the \nStarkville Municipal Separate School District and the Oktibbeha County School District, \nrespectively, to immediately cease operation of dual school systems and to immediately begin to \noperate unitary school systems as required by the Supreme Court of the United States in \nAlexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19 (1969).  These Orders required the \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:83-cv-00293-MPM Doc #: 26 Filed: 07/13/15 2 of 18 PageID #: 620\n \nDistricts to immediately implement non-segregative policies in the following areas of operation: \nstudent assignment; faculty and staff; facilities, and; transportation.   \nIn the 2013 session, the Mississippi Legislature passed, and the Governor approved, \nHouse Bill 716, which mandated consolidation of the two Districts, effective July 1, 2015.  \nHouse Bill 716.   The legislation established a seven-member Commission on Starkville \nConsolidated School District Structure (the “Commission”) to review the existing structure of the \ntwo Districts and to make recommendations on future actions for the provision and transition of \nservices of the consolidated school district in order to improve both the quality of education and \nthe efficiency with which it is delivered.1   \nOn January 24, 2014, the Commission filed its Report to the Governor of Mississippi, the \nMississippi Legislature, and the Mississippi Board of Education (the “Report”).  The Report \nincludes the Commission’s proposed plan for consolidation of the Districts.     \nIn its 2014 session, the Mississippi Legislature passed, and the Governor approved, \nSenate Bill 2818, which, among other things, named the new consolidated school district the \n“Starkville-Oktibbeha Consolidated School District” and added funding options for the new \nconsolidated district.   \nWith respect to the Districts’ desegregation obligations, the Districts filed a Joint Motion \nto Consolidate Cases on November 14, 2014, followed by their Motion to Approve New \n                                                            \n1   The Commission held public meetings sixteen times over a period of eight months: May 15, June \n6, July 16, August 22, September 5, September 18, October 3, October 22, October 29, November 6, \nNovember 7, November 21, December 23, 2013, and on January 14 and January 24, 2014.  In addition, \nthe Commission held two public forums on August 22 and September 5, 2013, to which the general \npublic was provided notice so anyone could attend.  On November 5, 2013, Parents for Public Schools \nheld a twitter town hall regarding consolidation and a twitter student meeting on December 17, 2013.   \nFurther, on December 13, 2013, some members of the Commission met with citizens calling themselves \nthe Education Association of East Oktibbeha County Schools to discuss the consolidation.   On October \n22, 2013, the Commission met in executive session with counsel for both Districts to discuss the \nDistricts’ desegregation obligations with respect to consolidation. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:83-cv-00293-MPM Doc #: 26 Filed: 07/13/15 3 of 18 PageID #: 621\n \nDesegregation Order.  [Doc. # 10]  The Court granted the Motion to consolidate the two federal \ndesegregation cases.  [Doc. # 13]   \nOn May 22, 2015, the United States filed its Response, objecting to certain provisions of \nthe Districts’ proposed plan.  [Doc. # 20]  On June 5, 2015, the Districts filed their Joint Reply to \nthe Response of the United States.  [Doc. #23]  \nPursuant to a conference with this Court on July 1, 2015, the parties agreed to work \ntogether to finalize and submit a proposed desegregation order for the Consolidated District to be \neffective as of the date of this Order and to govern the Consolidated District for the 2015-16 \nschool year.   \nThe United States expressly reserves and does not waive any objections that it raised in \nits Response.

In making assignments, \nthe District shall consider, as appropriate, faculty seniority, areas of certification, and experience. \nC.  Staff members who work directly with children and professional staff who work \non the administrative level will be hired, assigned, promoted, paid, demoted, dismissed, and \notherwise treated without regard to race, color, or national origin. \nD.

If a reduction in force is initiated, the District shall use non-racial objective \ncriteria in selecting the staff member(s) dismissed or demoted2.  These criteria shall be available \nfor public inspection and shall be retained by the District.  The District shall also record and \npreserve the evaluation of staff members under the criteria.  Such evaluation shall be made \navailable upon request to the dismissed or demoted employee. \n                                                            \n2   “Demotion” includes any reassignment (1) under which the staff member receives less pay or has less \nresponsibility than under the assignment held previously, (2) which requires a lesser degree of skill than did the \nassignment he/she held previously, or (3) under which the staff member is asked to teach a subject or grade other \nthan one for which he/she is certified or for which he/she has had substantial experience within a reasonably current \nperiod.  In general and depending upon the subject matter involved, five years is such a reasonable period. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:83-cv-00293-MPM Doc #: 26 Filed: 07/13/15 6 of 18 PageID #: 624\n \nG.

The principal at each school will \nrecommend faculty and staff to the Superintendent and ultimately to the Board.   \nIV.  School Construction and Site Selection \n  All school construction, school consolidation, and site selection (including the location of \nany temporary classrooms) in the system shall be done in a manner which will prevent the \nrecurrence of the dual school structure. \nV.
