The plaintiffs (which included the NAACP) alleged that the PPST was racially discriminatory and violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act, and the contract between the United States and the State of Texas guaranteeing equal opportunity in higher education. The case was filed on March 23, 1971, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

As we demonstrate in this reply brief, however,\nnone of these alternative grounds for affirmance withstand\nscrutiny.\n\n-2-\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE ABSENCE OF JURISDICTION UNDER THE\nSTATE OF TEXAS DECREE REQUIRES REVERSAL\nOF THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION\nIn our opening brief, we argued (Br. 16-22) that the\ndistrict court's authority to enforce the State of Texas\ndecree did not give it jurisdiction to decide appellees' challenge\nto the State's use of the PPST. Appellees contend that even\nassuming the United States is correct on this point, it\nshould not lead to reversal of the district court's decision.\nAppellees make two arguments in support of this contention.\nNeither is persuasive.\nAppellees first argue that since appellate review\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1) extends only to those parts of\nthe court's order that relate to its grant of an injunction,\nthis Court should decline any consideration of jurisdiction\n(LULAC Br. 43-44). It is well established, however, that\n\"[a]n appellate federal court must satisfy itself not only\nof its own jurisdiction, but also of that of the lower courts\nin a cause under review.\" Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U.S.\n237, 244 (1934). This duty applies in all cases, including\nappeals from grants of preliminary injunctions. As the\nSupreme Court has held, \"[t]he right to remedial relief falls\nwith an injunction which events prove was erroneously issued,\n* * * and a fortiori when the injunction or restraining\norder was beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\" United\nStates v. Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 295 (1947). Thus,\n\n-3-\nthis Court is required to determine whether the district\ncourt had jurisdiction over appellees' claims.\nAppellees alternatively contend that since they could\nfile a separate suit against the Commissioner of Education\nunder Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), the absence of\njurisdiction under the State of Texas decree should not\nmatter (LULAC Br. 43). The fact is, however, that appellees\nhave not filed such a suit. Had they done so, it presumably\nwould have been assigned randomly. By filing a motion to\nenforce the State of Texas decree, appellees could effectively\nselect the judge of their choice. But neither the judicial\ncode nor the rules of procedure allow the plaintiff to select\nthe judge. Accordingly, if, as we argue, the district court\ndid not have jurisdiction under the State of Texas decree,\nthis Court should reverse and remand with directions to\ndismiss appellees' motion. Such a disposition would leave\nappellees free to file a separate suit challenging the State's\nuse of the PPST and thereby return them to the position they\nwould have been in had they not improperly invoked jurisdiction\nin this case.\n\n-4-\nII\nTHERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS THAT\nWOULD SUPPORT AFFIRMANCE OF THE DISTRICT\nCOURT'S HOLDING THAT APPELLEES WERE LIKELY\nTO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS\nIn our opening brief, we argued that the district court\nerred in holding that appellees were likely to prevail on the\nmerits. In particular, we showed that the district court was\nmistaken in concluding that appellees were likely to prevail\non their claims that (1) the State's use of the PPST reflected\nintentional discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause (Br. 22-31); (2) the State failed to give adequate notice\nof the test in violation of the Due Process Clause (Br. 31-36);\n(3) the State's use of the test reflected intentional discrimination\nin violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n2000d (Br. 37); and (4) the State's use of the test perpetuated\nthe effects of prior segregation in violation of Section 204(b)\nof the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), 20 U.S.C.\n1703(b) (Br. 38-43).\nAppellees have now raised five additional theories of\nliability not relied on by the district court. As we demonstrate\nbelow, none of them provide a basis for affirming the district\ncourt's decision.\n\n-5-\nA. The State's use of the PPST as an absolute condition for\nadmission into teacher education programs does not violate\nthe Due Process Clause\nAppellees contend (NAACP Br. 20-24) that the State's\nuse of the PPST as an absolute condition for admission into\nteacher education programs violates the Due Process Clause.\nThis contention is without merit.\nState educational decisions violate the Due Process\nClause only if they are shown to be without any rational basis.\nMahavongsanan v. Hall, 529 F.2d 448, 449 (5th Cir. 1976).\nAppellees have fallen far short of showing that the State's\nuse of the PPST fails to satisfy this baseline requirement.\nAppellees are apparently of the view that the use of\nmultiple factors, including a student's grades, would be a\nbetter way to measure basic skills. But the State could\ncertainly conclude that because of grade inflation and the\nvariation in grading standards from institution to institution,\nthe use of a student's grades would be neither reliable nor\nfair (Tr. 1588-1589). More fundamentally, as this Court explained\nin Tyler v. Vickery, 517 F.2d 1089, 1102 (1975), \"the focus\nof the rational relationship test is not whether the state\nhas superior means available to accomplish its objectives,\nbut whether the means it has chosen is a reasonable one.\"\nSince the PPST is undeniably a reasonable way to assess\nbasic skills, the possibility that there may be other ways\n\n- 6 -\n1/\nfor the State to achieve this goal is constitutionally irrelevant.\nIn any event, as we pointed out in our opening brief,\nthe State Board adopted the PPST only after concluding on\nthe basis of a thorough validation study that it measured\nthe basic skills needed to absorb teacher training and to\nperform adequately as a teacher (Br. 27). This validation\nstudy was more than sufficient to give the State a rational\n2/\nbasis for using the PPST.\n1/ Contrary to appellees' claim (NAACP Br. 20), Armstead v.\nStarkville Municipal Separate School District, 461 F.2d 276\n(5th Cir. 1972), did not hold that tests used as an absolute\ncondition of employment must be subjected to strict scrutiny.\nTo the contrary, Armstead held that such tests must be upheld\nunless they are \"without any reasonable basis.\" Id. at 280.\nApplying this standard, this Court struck down a school\ndistrict's use of the GRE as a basis for teacher hiring, but\nonly because it was undisputed that the test \"was not designed\nto and could not measure the competency of a teacher or even\nindicate future teacher effectiveness.\" Ibid. As discussed\nabove, in this case, the State acted on the basis of substantial\nevidence that the PPST measures skills that are needed to\nabsorb teacher training and to perform successfully as a\nteacher. Accordingly, to the extent that Armstead is relevant\nat all, it supports the constitutionality of the State's\ndecision here.\n2/ While appellees have attacked the State's validation study on\nnumerous technical grounds (NAACP Br. 38-44), they do not and\ncannot contend that the study's conclusions that the test measures\nskills that are needed to absorb teacher training and to perform\nadequately as a teacher are wholly irrational. In citing the\nState's validation study as evidence of the rationality of the\nState's decision to use the PPST, we do not suggest that a state\nmust perform a validation study before using a test. As long\nas a state's use of a test is rationally related to a permissible\npurpose, the Due Process inquiry is at an end.\n\n-7-\nB. The State's failure to provide remedial programs specifically\ndirected at the PPST does not violate the Due Process Clause\nAppellees argue (NAACP Br. 27-36) that the State has\na duty under the Due Process Clause to provide students who\nfail the PPST with remedial programs specifically designed to\nhelp them pass that test. Appellees rely on this Court's\ndecision in Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397 (1981), as the\nsource of this extraordinary obligation. Appellees' reliance\non Debra P. is misplaced.\nIn Debra P., this Court held that a state may not use\na test as a high school graduation requirement unless it tests\nwhat has been taught. 644 F.2d at 404-406. This Court's\ndecision did not in any way suggest, however, that a state\nhas a general duty under the Due Process Clause to provide\nremedial education to those who fail state-administered\ntests. To be sure, the Eleventh Circuit subsequently alluded\nto Florida's remedial efforts in sustaining the constitutionality\nof that state's graduation test. Debra P. v. Turlington,\n730 F.2d 1405, 1410-1412 (1984) (Debra P. II). But those\nremedial efforts were simply regarded as evidence that the\ngraduation exam tested material that had been taught. Ibid.\nProperly viewed, Debra P. lends no support to appellees\nhere. To begin with, the district court found that appellees\nhad failed to show that they were likely to prevail on their\nclaim that the PPST tests material that has not been taught\n(Memo. Op. 38). Appellees do not attack this finding as\nclearly erroneous.\n\n- 8 -\nMore fundamentally, Debra P. did not hold that a\nstate can never test material that has not been taught.\nDebra P. dealt only with a high school graduation test, and the\nCourt carefully limited its holding to that kind of test. 644 F.2d at\n404-406. Nothing in Debra P. implies that its holding encompasses\ntests used for admission into professional schools and ultimately\ninto the profession itself. A state has a legitimate -- indeed,\ncompelling -- interest in preventing those who lack basic\nskills from entering the teaching profession. That interest\ndoes not disappear simply because the reason that particular\nindividuals lack basic skills is that they have not been\ntaught them. For this reason, a state is tree under the Due\nProcess Clause to give a basic skills test as a condition of\nentry into a teacher training program regardless of whether\nthe test covers material that certain students have not been\n3/\ntaught. Nothing in Debra P. suggests otherwise.\n3/ To buttress all their Due Process claims, appellees assert\nthat the PPST not only interferes with their liberty interest in\npursuing the profession of their choice, but also with their\nproperty interest in fair access to teacher education programs\n(NAACP Br. 16-17). As the district court properly held, however,\nState law does not give students any entitlement to teacher\neducation training (Memo. Op. 34-35). It may be, as appellees\nsuggest (NAACP Br. 17), that many students had hoped they would\nbe able to enter teacher education programs without having to\npass a basic skills test. But as the Supreme Court has\nheld, \"[tJo have a property interest in a benefit, a person\nclearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.\nHe must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must,\ninstead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" Board\nof Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). In any event,\neven assuming appellees had a property interest in entry into\nteacher education programs, Due Process would be violated\nonly if the State's removal of that interest was arbitrary\nor capricious. Debra P., supra, 644 F.2d at 404. As we\nhave already discussed, the State's decision to use the PPST\nwas neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n\n-9-\nC. This Court should not reach the question whether the State's\nuse of the PPST violates the Title VI effects test regulation\nWe pointed out in our opening brief (Br. 37, n. 7) that\nthe district court did not reach the question whether appellees\nwere likely to succeed on their claim that the PPST has \"the\neffect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\" in violation\nof the Title VI effects test regulation (34 C.F.R. 100.3(b)(2)).\nWe therefore urged this Court to refrain from deciding that\nissue (Br. 37, n. 7). Appellees now make the remarkable suggestion\nthat the district court did decide that they were likely to\nprevail on their claim under the Title VI effects test regulation\n(NAACP Br. 37, n. 8). According to appellees, this conclusion\nfollows from \"a fair reading of the Opinion as a whole\" (ibid.).\nWe submit that whether this Court reads the district court's\nopinion page by page, or whether it reads it \"as a whole,\"\nit will not find a single word in it that remotely suggests\nthat the district court found that appellees were likely to\nprevail on their Title VI regulation claim.\nAppellees are correct in stating (NAACP Br. 38, n. 8)\nthat as a general rule, this Court may affirm on a ground\nnot relied on by the district court. Bickford v. Int'l\nSpeedway Corp., 654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir. 1981). But\nfor two reasons this is not an appropriate occasion for\ninvoking that principle.\nFirst, appellees' Title VI regulation claim presents\na substantial unresolved legal issue concerning the nature of\na recipient's burden in justifying a practice that has a\ndisproportionate impact on members of a racial minority.\n\n- 10 -\nAppellees have simply assumed (NAACP Br. 37) that the validation\nprinciples established under Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e, apply with full force to a\nTitle VI regulation claim. Although this is one possible\nway to structure a recipient's burden, it is not the only\none. For example, a showing of a disproportionate impact\nmay simply shift the burden to the recipient to show \"that\nits decision was the product of a rational decision-making\nprocess.\" Bryan v. Koch, 627 F.2d 612, 621 (2d Cir. 1980)\n(Kearse, concurring in part and dissenting in part). Since\nthe Title VI effects test regulation applies to all programs\nreceiving federal financial assistance, the resolution of\nthis issue will have far-reaching consequences. A decision\nof this importance should not be made on an appeal from the\ngrant of a preliminary injunction. See University of Texas\nv. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 394-395 (1981).\nMore fundamentally, an appellate court can affirm on\na ground not relied on by the district court only when the\ndistrict court's factual findings permit it. Estate of\nWhitt v. C.I.R., 751 F.2d 1548, 1558 (11th Cir. 1985).(cid:9) In\nthis case, the parties introduced extensive and conflicting\nevidence on the validity of the PPST (Tr. 251-403, 579-821,\n1191-1332, 1349-1398; Hilliard deposition; Pltfs. Ex. 26).\nIn response, the district court discussed only the evidence\nbearing on instructional validity and found that appellees\nwere unlikely to prevail on this issue (Memo. Op. 38-41).\n\n- 11 -\nThe court simply did not address most of the validation\nevidence. Thus, even accepting appellees' contention that\nthe effects test regulation incorporates Title  VII validation\nstandards, the district court's findings do not permit this\nCourt to determine whether the State satisfied those standards.\nUndaunted by the absence of district court findings,\nappellees have invited this Court to resolve the conflicts\nin the evidence and to make its own findings of fact (NAACP\nBr. 38-44). For example, appellees introduced evidence\nthat the State failed to perform a proper analysis of\nwhat skills were needed to absorb teacher training (Tr. 278-279).\nThe State, on the other hand, presented evidence that its\nanalysis was adequate (Tr. 650-651). Appellees now ask this\nCourt to resolve this conflict in their favor (NAACP Br. 40).\nSimilarly, appellees presented evidence that the State failed\nto conduct a sufficient item analysis (Tr. 316-317). In\nresponse, the State offered evidence that a sufficient item\nanalysis had been performed (Tr. 1219-1221, 1359-1369).\nAppellees urge this Court to rule in their favor on this factual\nissue as well (NAACP Br. 43). These are only two of the numerous\nfactual issues bearing on validity that appellees would have\nthis Court decide.\nAs the Supreme Court has made clear, however, the\nresolution of factual issues is not a proper function for an\nappellate court. Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273\n(1982). Indeed, the principle that an appellate court may\nnot assume the role of fact finder has particular force in\n\n- 12 -\npreliminary injunction appeals. Thus, when the propriety of\ninjunctive relief depends on the resolution of factual issues\nand the district court has failed to make the necessary\nfindings, an appellate court must reverse rather than find\nthe facts itself. First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. v. Camp,\n432 F.2d 481, 484 (4th Cir. 1970). That is the course this\nCourt should follow here.\nIn sum, it would be inappropriate for this Court to\naddress appellees' Title VI regulation claim. Appellees'\narguments to the contrary are without merit.\nD. The State's use of the PPST does not violate Section 204(d)\nof the EEOA\nAppellees contend (NAACP Br. 47-48) that the State's\nuse of the PPST violates Section 204(d) of the EEOA, 20 U.S.C.\n1703(d), which prohibits \"discrimination by an educational\nagency * * * in the employment, employment conditions, or\nassignment to schools of its faculty.\" This argument ignores\nthe fact that the PPST is used as a basis for admission into\nteacher education programs, not as a basis for hiring. Its\nuse, therefore, does not implicate Section 204(d).\nIn any event, Section 204(d) prohibits only purposeful\ndiscrimination. Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1000-1001\n(5th Cir. 1981). As we explained in our opening brief, there\nis no evidence that the State's use of the PPST reflects\nintentional discrimination (Br. 26-31). For this reason as\nwell, its use does not violate Section 204(d).\n\n- 13 -\nE. The State's use of the PPST does not violate Section 204(f)\nof the EEOA\nAppellees finally contend (NAACP Br. 48) that the\nState's use of the PPST violates Section 204(f) of the EEOA,\n20 U.S.C. 1703(f), which requires an educational agency to\n\"take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that\nimpede equal participation by its students in its instructional\nprograms.\" Regardless of the effect of the PPST, however,\nthe State's educational agencies remain under an obligation\nto provide Mexican-American students with the personnel they\nneed to secure equal educational opportunity. The district\ncourt did not find, and the evidence does not support a\nfinding, that the PPST will disable the State's educational\nagencies from fulfilling this responsibility.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed in this brief as well as those\ndiscussed in our opening brief, the district court's decision\nshould be reversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

As we demonstrate in this reply brief, however,\nnone of these alternative grounds for affirmance withstand\nscrutiny.\n\n-2-\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE ABSENCE OF JURISDICTION UNDER THE\nSTATE OF TEXAS DECREE REQUIRES REVERSAL\nOF THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION\nIn our opening brief, we argued (Br. 16-22) that the\ndistrict court's authority to enforce the State of Texas\ndecree did not give it jurisdiction to decide appellees' challenge\nto the State's use of the PPST. Appellees contend that even\nassuming the United States is correct on this point, it\nshould not lead to reversal of the district court's decision.\nAppellees make two arguments in support of this contention.\nNeither is persuasive.\nAppellees first argue that since appellate review\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1) extends only to those parts of\nthe court's order that relate to its grant of an injunction,\nthis Court should decline any consideration of jurisdiction\n(LULAC Br. 43-44). It is well established, however, that\n\"[a]n appellate federal court must satisfy itself not only\nof its own jurisdiction, but also of that of the lower courts\nin a cause under review.\" Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U.S.\n237, 244 (1934). This duty applies in all cases, including\nappeals from grants of preliminary injunctions. As the\nSupreme Court has held, \"[t]he right to remedial relief falls\nwith an injunction which events prove was erroneously issued,\n* * * and a fortiori when the injunction or restraining\norder was beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\" United\nStates v. Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 295 (1947). Thus,\n\n-3-\nthis Court is required to determine whether the district\ncourt had jurisdiction over appellees' claims.\nAppellees alternatively contend that since they could\nfile a separate suit against the Commissioner of Education\nunder Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), the absence of\njurisdiction under the State of Texas decree should not\nmatter (LULAC Br. 43). The fact is, however, that appellees\nhave not filed such a suit. Had they done so, it presumably\nwould have been assigned randomly. By filing a motion to\nenforce the State of Texas decree, appellees could effectively\nselect the judge of their choice. But neither the judicial\ncode nor the rules of procedure allow the plaintiff to select\nthe judge. Accordingly, if, as we argue, the district court\ndid not have jurisdiction under the State of Texas decree,\nthis Court should reverse and remand with directions to\ndismiss appellees' motion. Such a disposition would leave\nappellees free to file a separate suit challenging the State's\nuse of the PPST and thereby return them to the position they\nwould have been in had they not improperly invoked jurisdiction\nin this case.\n\n-4-\nII\nTHERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS THAT\nWOULD SUPPORT AFFIRMANCE OF THE DISTRICT\nCOURT'S HOLDING THAT APPELLEES WERE LIKELY\nTO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS\nIn our opening brief, we argued that the district court\nerred in holding that appellees were likely to prevail on the\nmerits. In particular, we showed that the district court was\nmistaken in concluding that appellees were likely to prevail\non their claims that (1) the State's use of the PPST reflected\nintentional discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause (Br. 22-31); (2) the State failed to give adequate notice\nof the test in violation of the Due Process Clause (Br. 31-36);\n(3) the State's use of the test reflected intentional discrimination\nin violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n2000d (Br. 37); and (4) the State's use of the test perpetuated\nthe effects of prior segregation in violation of Section 204(b)\nof the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), 20 U.S.C.\n1703(b) (Br. 38-43).\nAppellees have now raised five additional theories of\nliability not relied on by the district court. As we demonstrate\nbelow, none of them provide a basis for affirming the district\ncourt's decision.\n\n-5-\nA. The State's use of the PPST as an absolute condition for\nadmission into teacher education programs does not violate\nthe Due Process Clause\nAppellees contend (NAACP Br. 20-24) that the State's\nuse of the PPST as an absolute condition for admission into\nteacher education programs violates the Due Process Clause.\nThis contention is without merit.\nState educational decisions violate the Due Process\nClause only if they are shown to be without any rational basis.\nMahavongsanan v. Hall, 529 F.2d 448, 449 (5th Cir. 1976).\nAppellees have fallen far short of showing that the State's\nuse of the PPST fails to satisfy this baseline requirement.\nAppellees are apparently of the view that the use of\nmultiple factors, including a student's grades, would be a\nbetter way to measure basic skills. But the State could\ncertainly conclude that because of grade inflation and the\nvariation in grading standards from institution to institution,\nthe use of a student's grades would be neither reliable nor\nfair (Tr. 1588-1589). More fundamentally, as this Court explained\nin Tyler v. Vickery, 517 F.2d 1089, 1102 (1975), \"the focus\nof the rational relationship test is not whether the state\nhas superior means available to accomplish its objectives,\nbut whether the means it has chosen is a reasonable one.\"\nSince the PPST is undeniably a reasonable way to assess\nbasic skills, the possibility that there may be other ways\n\n- 6 -\n1/\nfor the State to achieve this goal is constitutionally irrelevant.\nIn any event, as we pointed out in our opening brief,\nthe State Board adopted the PPST only after concluding on\nthe basis of a thorough validation study that it measured\nthe basic skills needed to absorb teacher training and to\nperform adequately as a teacher (Br. 27). This validation\nstudy was more than sufficient to give the State a rational\n2/\nbasis for using the PPST.\n1/ Contrary to appellees' claim (NAACP Br. 20), Armstead v.\nStarkville Municipal Separate School District, 461 F.2d 276\n(5th Cir. 1972), did not hold that tests used as an absolute\ncondition of employment must be subjected to strict scrutiny.\nTo the contrary, Armstead held that such tests must be upheld\nunless they are \"without any reasonable basis.\" Id. at 280.\nApplying this standard, this Court struck down a school\ndistrict's use of the GRE as a basis for teacher hiring, but\nonly because it was undisputed that the test \"was not designed\nto and could not measure the competency of a teacher or even\nindicate future teacher effectiveness.\" Ibid. As discussed\nabove, in this case, the State acted on the basis of substantial\nevidence that the PPST measures skills that are needed to\nabsorb teacher training and to perform successfully as a\nteacher. Accordingly, to the extent that Armstead is relevant\nat all, it supports the constitutionality of the State's\ndecision here.\n2/ While appellees have attacked the State's validation study on\nnumerous technical grounds (NAACP Br. 38-44), they do not and\ncannot contend that the study's conclusions that the test measures\nskills that are needed to absorb teacher training and to perform\nadequately as a teacher are wholly irrational. In citing the\nState's validation study as evidence of the rationality of the\nState's decision to use the PPST, we do not suggest that a state\nmust perform a validation study before using a test. As long\nas a state's use of a test is rationally related to a permissible\npurpose, the Due Process inquiry is at an end.\n\n-7-\nB. The State's failure to provide remedial programs specifically\ndirected at the PPST does not violate the Due Process Clause\nAppellees argue (NAACP Br. 27-36) that the State has\na duty under the Due Process Clause to provide students who\nfail the PPST with remedial programs specifically designed to\nhelp them pass that test. Appellees rely on this Court's\ndecision in Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397 (1981), as the\nsource of this extraordinary obligation. Appellees' reliance\non Debra P. is misplaced.\nIn Debra P., this Court held that a state may not use\na test as a high school graduation requirement unless it tests\nwhat has been taught. 644 F.2d at 404-406. This Court's\ndecision did not in any way suggest, however, that a state\nhas a general duty under the Due Process Clause to provide\nremedial education to those who fail state-administered\ntests. To be sure, the Eleventh Circuit subsequently alluded\nto Florida's remedial efforts in sustaining the constitutionality\nof that state's graduation test. Debra P. v. Turlington,\n730 F.2d 1405, 1410-1412 (1984) (Debra P. II). But those\nremedial efforts were simply regarded as evidence that the\ngraduation exam tested material that had been taught. Ibid.\nProperly viewed, Debra P. lends no support to appellees\nhere. To begin with, the district court found that appellees\nhad failed to show that they were likely to prevail on their\nclaim that the PPST tests material that has not been taught\n(Memo. Op. 38). Appellees do not attack this finding as\nclearly erroneous.\n\n- 8 -\nMore fundamentally, Debra P. did not hold that a\nstate can never test material that has not been taught.\nDebra P. dealt only with a high school graduation test, and the\nCourt carefully limited its holding to that kind of test. 644 F.2d at\n404-406. Nothing in Debra P. implies that its holding encompasses\ntests used for admission into professional schools and ultimately\ninto the profession itself. A state has a legitimate -- indeed,\ncompelling -- interest in preventing those who lack basic\nskills from entering the teaching profession. That interest\ndoes not disappear simply because the reason that particular\nindividuals lack basic skills is that they have not been\ntaught them. For this reason, a state is tree under the Due\nProcess Clause to give a basic skills test as a condition of\nentry into a teacher training program regardless of whether\nthe test covers material that certain students have not been\n3/\ntaught. Nothing in Debra P. suggests otherwise.\n3/ To buttress all their Due Process claims, appellees assert\nthat the PPST not only interferes with their liberty interest in\npursuing the profession of their choice, but also with their\nproperty interest in fair access to teacher education programs\n(NAACP Br. 16-17). As the district court properly held, however,\nState law does not give students any entitlement to teacher\neducation training (Memo. Op. 34-35). It may be, as appellees\nsuggest (NAACP Br. 17), that many students had hoped they would\nbe able to enter teacher education programs without having to\npass a basic skills test. But as the Supreme Court has\nheld, \"[tJo have a property interest in a benefit, a person\nclearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.\nHe must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must,\ninstead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" Board\nof Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). In any event,\neven assuming appellees had a property interest in entry into\nteacher education programs, Due Process would be violated\nonly if the State's removal of that interest was arbitrary\nor capricious. Debra P., supra, 644 F.2d at 404. As we\nhave already discussed, the State's decision to use the PPST\nwas neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n\n-9-\nC. This Court should not reach the question whether the State's\nuse of the PPST violates the Title VI effects test regulation\nWe pointed out in our opening brief (Br. 37, n. 7) that\nthe district court did not reach the question whether appellees\nwere likely to succeed on their claim that the PPST has \"the\neffect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\" in violation\nof the Title VI effects test regulation (34 C.F.R. 100.3(b)(2)).\nWe therefore urged this Court to refrain from deciding that\nissue (Br. 37, n. 7). Appellees now make the remarkable suggestion\nthat the district court did decide that they were likely to\nprevail on their claim under the Title VI effects test regulation\n(NAACP Br. 37, n. 8). According to appellees, this conclusion\nfollows from \"a fair reading of the Opinion as a whole\" (ibid.).\nWe submit that whether this Court reads the district court's\nopinion page by page, or whether it reads it \"as a whole,\"\nit will not find a single word in it that remotely suggests\nthat the district court found that appellees were likely to\nprevail on their Title VI regulation claim.\nAppellees are correct in stating (NAACP Br. 38, n. 8)\nthat as a general rule, this Court may affirm on a ground\nnot relied on by the district court. Bickford v. Int'l\nSpeedway Corp., 654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir. 1981). But\nfor two reasons this is not an appropriate occasion for\ninvoking that principle.\nFirst, appellees' Title VI regulation claim presents\na substantial unresolved legal issue concerning the nature of\na recipient's burden in justifying a practice that has a\ndisproportionate impact on members of a racial minority.\n\n- 10 -\nAppellees have simply assumed (NAACP Br. 37) that the validation\nprinciples established under Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e, apply with full force to a\nTitle VI regulation claim. Although this is one possible\nway to structure a recipient's burden, it is not the only\none. For example, a showing of a disproportionate impact\nmay simply shift the burden to the recipient to show \"that\nits decision was the product of a rational decision-making\nprocess.\" Bryan v. Koch, 627 F.2d 612, 621 (2d Cir. 1980)\n(Kearse, concurring in part and dissenting in part). Since\nthe Title VI effects test regulation applies to all programs\nreceiving federal financial assistance, the resolution of\nthis issue will have far-reaching consequences. A decision\nof this importance should not be made on an appeal from the\ngrant of a preliminary injunction. See University of Texas\nv. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 394-395 (1981).\nMore fundamentally, an appellate court can affirm on\na ground not relied on by the district court only when the\ndistrict court's factual findings permit it. Estate of\nWhitt v. C.I.R., 751 F.2d 1548, 1558 (11th Cir. 1985).(cid:9) In\nthis case, the parties introduced extensive and conflicting\nevidence on the validity of the PPST (Tr. 251-403, 579-821,\n1191-1332, 1349-1398; Hilliard deposition; Pltfs. Ex. 26).\nIn response, the district court discussed only the evidence\nbearing on instructional validity and found that appellees\nwere unlikely to prevail on this issue (Memo. Op. 38-41).\n\n- 11 -\nThe court simply did not address most of the validation\nevidence. Thus, even accepting appellees' contention that\nthe effects test regulation incorporates Title  VII validation\nstandards, the district court's findings do not permit this\nCourt to determine whether the State satisfied those standards.\nUndaunted by the absence of district court findings,\nappellees have invited this Court to resolve the conflicts\nin the evidence and to make its own findings of fact (NAACP\nBr. 38-44). For example, appellees introduced evidence\nthat the State failed to perform a proper analysis of\nwhat skills were needed to absorb teacher training (Tr. 278-279).\nThe State, on the other hand, presented evidence that its\nanalysis was adequate (Tr. 650-651). Appellees now ask this\nCourt to resolve this conflict in their favor (NAACP Br. 40).\nSimilarly, appellees presented evidence that the State failed\nto conduct a sufficient item analysis (Tr. 316-317). In\nresponse, the State offered evidence that a sufficient item\nanalysis had been performed (Tr. 1219-1221, 1359-1369).\nAppellees urge this Court to rule in their favor on this factual\nissue as well (NAACP Br. 43). These are only two of the numerous\nfactual issues bearing on validity that appellees would have\nthis Court decide.\nAs the Supreme Court has made clear, however, the\nresolution of factual issues is not a proper function for an\nappellate court. Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273\n(1982). Indeed, the principle that an appellate court may\nnot assume the role of fact finder has particular force in\n\n- 12 -\npreliminary injunction appeals. Thus, when the propriety of\ninjunctive relief depends on the resolution of factual issues\nand the district court has failed to make the necessary\nfindings, an appellate court must reverse rather than find\nthe facts itself. First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. v. Camp,\n432 F.2d 481, 484 (4th Cir. 1970). That is the course this\nCourt should follow here.\nIn sum, it would be inappropriate for this Court to\naddress appellees' Title VI regulation claim. Appellees'\narguments to the contrary are without merit.\nD. The State's use of the PPST does not violate Section 204(d)\nof the EEOA\nAppellees contend (NAACP Br. 47-48) that the State's\nuse of the PPST violates Section 204(d) of the EEOA, 20 U.S.C.\n1703(d), which prohibits \"discrimination by an educational\nagency * * * in the employment, employment conditions, or\nassignment to schools of its faculty.\" This argument ignores\nthe fact that the PPST is used as a basis for admission into\nteacher education programs, not as a basis for hiring. Its\nuse, therefore, does not implicate Section 204(d).\nIn any event, Section 204(d) prohibits only purposeful\ndiscrimination. Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1000-1001\n(5th Cir. 1981). As we explained in our opening brief, there\nis no evidence that the State's use of the PPST reflects\nintentional discrimination (Br. 26-31). For this reason as\nwell, its use does not violate Section 204(d).\n\n- 13 -\nE. The State's use of the PPST does not violate Section 204(f)\nof the EEOA\nAppellees finally contend (NAACP Br. 48) that the\nState's use of the PPST violates Section 204(f) of the EEOA,\n20 U.S.C. 1703(f), which requires an educational agency to\n\"take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that\nimpede equal participation by its students in its instructional\nprograms.\" Regardless of the effect of the PPST, however,\nthe State's educational agencies remain under an obligation\nto provide Mexican-American students with the personnel they\nneed to secure equal educational opportunity. The district\ncourt did not find, and the evidence does not support a\nfinding, that the PPST will disable the State's educational\nagencies from fulfilling this responsibility.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed in this brief as well as those\ndiscussed in our opening brief, the district court's decision\nshould be reversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

As we demonstrate in this reply brief, however,\nnone of these alternative grounds for affirmance withstand\nscrutiny.\n\n-2-\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE ABSENCE OF JURISDICTION UNDER THE\nSTATE OF TEXAS DECREE REQUIRES REVERSAL\nOF THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION\nIn our opening brief, we argued (Br. 16-22) that the\ndistrict court's authority to enforce the State of Texas\ndecree did not give it jurisdiction to decide appellees' challenge\nto the State's use of the PPST. Appellees contend that even\nassuming the United States is correct on this point, it\nshould not lead to reversal of the district court's decision.\nAppellees make two arguments in support of this contention.\nNeither is persuasive.\nAppellees first argue that since appellate review\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1) extends only to those parts of\nthe court's order that relate to its grant of an injunction,\nthis Court should decline any consideration of jurisdiction\n(LULAC Br. 43-44). It is well established, however, that\n\"[a]n appellate federal court must satisfy itself not only\nof its own jurisdiction, but also of that of the lower courts\nin a cause under review.\" Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U.S.\n237, 244 (1934). This duty applies in all cases, including\nappeals from grants of preliminary injunctions. As the\nSupreme Court has held, \"[t]he right to remedial relief falls\nwith an injunction which events prove was erroneously issued,\n* * * and a fortiori when the injunction or restraining\norder was beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\" United\nStates v. Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 295 (1947). Thus,\n\n-3-\nthis Court is required to determine whether the district\ncourt had jurisdiction over appellees' claims.\nAppellees alternatively contend that since they could\nfile a separate suit against the Commissioner of Education\nunder Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), the absence of\njurisdiction under the State of Texas decree should not\nmatter (LULAC Br. 43). The fact is, however, that appellees\nhave not filed such a suit. Had they done so, it presumably\nwould have been assigned randomly. By filing a motion to\nenforce the State of Texas decree, appellees could effectively\nselect the judge of their choice. But neither the judicial\ncode nor the rules of procedure allow the plaintiff to select\nthe judge. Accordingly, if, as we argue, the district court\ndid not have jurisdiction under the State of Texas decree,\nthis Court should reverse and remand with directions to\ndismiss appellees' motion. Such a disposition would leave\nappellees free to file a separate suit challenging the State's\nuse of the PPST and thereby return them to the position they\nwould have been in had they not improperly invoked jurisdiction\nin this case.\n\n-4-\nII\nTHERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS THAT\nWOULD SUPPORT AFFIRMANCE OF THE DISTRICT\nCOURT'S HOLDING THAT APPELLEES WERE LIKELY\nTO PREVAIL ON THE MERITS\nIn our opening brief, we argued that the district court\nerred in holding that appellees were likely to prevail on the\nmerits. In particular, we showed that the district court was\nmistaken in concluding that appellees were likely to prevail\non their claims that (1) the State's use of the PPST reflected\nintentional discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause (Br. 22-31); (2) the State failed to give adequate notice\nof the test in violation of the Due Process Clause (Br. 31-36);\n(3) the State's use of the test reflected intentional discrimination\nin violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n2000d (Br. 37); and (4) the State's use of the test perpetuated\nthe effects of prior segregation in violation of Section 204(b)\nof the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), 20 U.S.C.\n1703(b) (Br. 38-43).\nAppellees have now raised five additional theories of\nliability not relied on by the district court. As we demonstrate\nbelow, none of them provide a basis for affirming the district\ncourt's decision.\n\n-5-\nA. The State's use of the PPST as an absolute condition for\nadmission into teacher education programs does not violate\nthe Due Process Clause\nAppellees contend (NAACP Br. 20-24) that the State's\nuse of the PPST as an absolute condition for admission into\nteacher education programs violates the Due Process Clause.\nThis contention is without merit.\nState educational decisions violate the Due Process\nClause only if they are shown to be without any rational basis.\nMahavongsanan v. Hall, 529 F.2d 448, 449 (5th Cir. 1976).\nAppellees have fallen far short of showing that the State's\nuse of the PPST fails to satisfy this baseline requirement.\nAppellees are apparently of the view that the use of\nmultiple factors, including a student's grades, would be a\nbetter way to measure basic skills. But the State could\ncertainly conclude that because of grade inflation and the\nvariation in grading standards from institution to institution,\nthe use of a student's grades would be neither reliable nor\nfair (Tr. 1588-1589). More fundamentally, as this Court explained\nin Tyler v. Vickery, 517 F.2d 1089, 1102 (1975), \"the focus\nof the rational relationship test is not whether the state\nhas superior means available to accomplish its objectives,\nbut whether the means it has chosen is a reasonable one.\"\nSince the PPST is undeniably a reasonable way to assess\nbasic skills, the possibility that there may be other ways\n\n- 6 -\n1/\nfor the State to achieve this goal is constitutionally irrelevant.\nIn any event, as we pointed out in our opening brief,\nthe State Board adopted the PPST only after concluding on\nthe basis of a thorough validation study that it measured\nthe basic skills needed to absorb teacher training and to\nperform adequately as a teacher (Br. 27). This validation\nstudy was more than sufficient to give the State a rational\n2/\nbasis for using the PPST.\n1/ Contrary to appellees' claim (NAACP Br. 20), Armstead v.\nStarkville Municipal Separate School District, 461 F.2d 276\n(5th Cir. 1972), did not hold that tests used as an absolute\ncondition of employment must be subjected to strict scrutiny.\nTo the contrary, Armstead held that such tests must be upheld\nunless they are \"without any reasonable basis.\" Id. at 280.\nApplying this standard, this Court struck down a school\ndistrict's use of the GRE as a basis for teacher hiring, but\nonly because it was undisputed that the test \"was not designed\nto and could not measure the competency of a teacher or even\nindicate future teacher effectiveness.\" Ibid. As discussed\nabove, in this case, the State acted on the basis of substantial\nevidence that the PPST measures skills that are needed to\nabsorb teacher training and to perform successfully as a\nteacher. Accordingly, to the extent that Armstead is relevant\nat all, it supports the constitutionality of the State's\ndecision here.\n2/ While appellees have attacked the State's validation study on\nnumerous technical grounds (NAACP Br. 38-44), they do not and\ncannot contend that the study's conclusions that the test measures\nskills that are needed to absorb teacher training and to perform\nadequately as a teacher are wholly irrational. In citing the\nState's validation study as evidence of the rationality of the\nState's decision to use the PPST, we do not suggest that a state\nmust perform a validation study before using a test. As long\nas a state's use of a test is rationally related to a permissible\npurpose, the Due Process inquiry is at an end.\n\n-7-\nB. The State's failure to provide remedial programs specifically\ndirected at the PPST does not violate the Due Process Clause\nAppellees argue (NAACP Br. 27-36) that the State has\na duty under the Due Process Clause to provide students who\nfail the PPST with remedial programs specifically designed to\nhelp them pass that test. Appellees rely on this Court's\ndecision in Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397 (1981), as the\nsource of this extraordinary obligation. Appellees' reliance\non Debra P. is misplaced.\nIn Debra P., this Court held that a state may not use\na test as a high school graduation requirement unless it tests\nwhat has been taught. 644 F.2d at 404-406. This Court's\ndecision did not in any way suggest, however, that a state\nhas a general duty under the Due Process Clause to provide\nremedial education to those who fail state-administered\ntests. To be sure, the Eleventh Circuit subsequently alluded\nto Florida's remedial efforts in sustaining the constitutionality\nof that state's graduation test. Debra P. v. Turlington,\n730 F.2d 1405, 1410-1412 (1984) (Debra P. II). But those\nremedial efforts were simply regarded as evidence that the\ngraduation exam tested material that had been taught. Ibid.\nProperly viewed, Debra P. lends no support to appellees\nhere. To begin with, the district court found that appellees\nhad failed to show that they were likely to prevail on their\nclaim that the PPST tests material that has not been taught\n(Memo. Op. 38). Appellees do not attack this finding as\nclearly erroneous.\n\n- 8 -\nMore fundamentally, Debra P. did not hold that a\nstate can never test material that has not been taught.\nDebra P. dealt only with a high school graduation test, and the\nCourt carefully limited its holding to that kind of test. 644 F.2d at\n404-406. Nothing in Debra P. implies that its holding encompasses\ntests used for admission into professional schools and ultimately\ninto the profession itself. A state has a legitimate -- indeed,\ncompelling -- interest in preventing those who lack basic\nskills from entering the teaching profession. That interest\ndoes not disappear simply because the reason that particular\nindividuals lack basic skills is that they have not been\ntaught them. For this reason, a state is tree under the Due\nProcess Clause to give a basic skills test as a condition of\nentry into a teacher training program regardless of whether\nthe test covers material that certain students have not been\n3/\ntaught. Nothing in Debra P. suggests otherwise.\n3/ To buttress all their Due Process claims, appellees assert\nthat the PPST not only interferes with their liberty interest in\npursuing the profession of their choice, but also with their\nproperty interest in fair access to teacher education programs\n(NAACP Br. 16-17). As the district court properly held, however,\nState law does not give students any entitlement to teacher\neducation training (Memo. Op. 34-35). It may be, as appellees\nsuggest (NAACP Br. 17), that many students had hoped they would\nbe able to enter teacher education programs without having to\npass a basic skills test. But as the Supreme Court has\nheld, \"[tJo have a property interest in a benefit, a person\nclearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.\nHe must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must,\ninstead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" Board\nof Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). In any event,\neven assuming appellees had a property interest in entry into\nteacher education programs, Due Process would be violated\nonly if the State's removal of that interest was arbitrary\nor capricious. Debra P., supra, 644 F.2d at 404. As we\nhave already discussed, the State's decision to use the PPST\nwas neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n\n-9-\nC. This Court should not reach the question whether the State's\nuse of the PPST violates the Title VI effects test regulation\nWe pointed out in our opening brief (Br. 37, n. 7) that\nthe district court did not reach the question whether appellees\nwere likely to succeed on their claim that the PPST has \"the\neffect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\" in violation\nof the Title VI effects test regulation (34 C.F.R. 100.3(b)(2)).\nWe therefore urged this Court to refrain from deciding that\nissue (Br. 37, n. 7). Appellees now make the remarkable suggestion\nthat the district court did decide that they were likely to\nprevail on their claim under the Title VI effects test regulation\n(NAACP Br. 37, n. 8). According to appellees, this conclusion\nfollows from \"a fair reading of the Opinion as a whole\" (ibid.).\nWe submit that whether this Court reads the district court's\nopinion page by page, or whether it reads it \"as a whole,\"\nit will not find a single word in it that remotely suggests\nthat the district court found that appellees were likely to\nprevail on their Title VI regulation claim.\nAppellees are correct in stating (NAACP Br. 38, n. 8)\nthat as a general rule, this Court may affirm on a ground\nnot relied on by the district court. Bickford v. Int'l\nSpeedway Corp., 654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir. 1981). But\nfor two reasons this is not an appropriate occasion for\ninvoking that principle.\nFirst, appellees' Title VI regulation claim presents\na substantial unresolved legal issue concerning the nature of\na recipient's burden in justifying a practice that has a\ndisproportionate impact on members of a racial minority.\n\n- 10 -\nAppellees have simply assumed (NAACP Br. 37) that the validation\nprinciples established under Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e, apply with full force to a\nTitle VI regulation claim. Although this is one possible\nway to structure a recipient's burden, it is not the only\none. For example, a showing of a disproportionate impact\nmay simply shift the burden to the recipient to show \"that\nits decision was the product of a rational decision-making\nprocess.\" Bryan v. Koch, 627 F.2d 612, 621 (2d Cir. 1980)\n(Kearse, concurring in part and dissenting in part). Since\nthe Title VI effects test regulation applies to all programs\nreceiving federal financial assistance, the resolution of\nthis issue will have far-reaching consequences. A decision\nof this importance should not be made on an appeal from the\ngrant of a preliminary injunction. See University of Texas\nv. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 394-395 (1981).\nMore fundamentally, an appellate court can affirm on\na ground not relied on by the district court only when the\ndistrict court's factual findings permit it. Estate of\nWhitt v. C.I.R., 751 F.2d 1548, 1558 (11th Cir. 1985).(cid:9) In\nthis case, the parties introduced extensive and conflicting\nevidence on the validity of the PPST (Tr. 251-403, 579-821,\n1191-1332, 1349-1398; Hilliard deposition; Pltfs. Ex. 26).\nIn response, the district court discussed only the evidence\nbearing on instructional validity and found that appellees\nwere unlikely to prevail on this issue (Memo. Op. 38-41).\n\n- 11 -\nThe court simply did not address most of the validation\nevidence. Thus, even accepting appellees' contention that\nthe effects test regulation incorporates Title  VII validation\nstandards, the district court's findings do not permit this\nCourt to determine whether the State satisfied those standards.\nUndaunted by the absence of district court findings,\nappellees have invited this Court to resolve the conflicts\nin the evidence and to make its own findings of fact (NAACP\nBr. 38-44). For example, appellees introduced evidence\nthat the State failed to perform a proper analysis of\nwhat skills were needed to absorb teacher training (Tr. 278-279).\nThe State, on the other hand, presented evidence that its\nanalysis was adequate (Tr. 650-651). Appellees now ask this\nCourt to resolve this conflict in their favor (NAACP Br. 40).\nSimilarly, appellees presented evidence that the State failed\nto conduct a sufficient item analysis (Tr. 316-317). In\nresponse, the State offered evidence that a sufficient item\nanalysis had been performed (Tr. 1219-1221, 1359-1369).\nAppellees urge this Court to rule in their favor on this factual\nissue as well (NAACP Br. 43). These are only two of the numerous\nfactual issues bearing on validity that appellees would have\nthis Court decide.\nAs the Supreme Court has made clear, however, the\nresolution of factual issues is not a proper function for an\nappellate court. Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273\n(1982). Indeed, the principle that an appellate court may\nnot assume the role of fact finder has particular force in\n\n- 12 -\npreliminary injunction appeals. Thus, when the propriety of\ninjunctive relief depends on the resolution of factual issues\nand the district court has failed to make the necessary\nfindings, an appellate court must reverse rather than find\nthe facts itself. First-Citizens Bank & Trust Co. v. Camp,\n432 F.2d 481, 484 (4th Cir. 1970). That is the course this\nCourt should follow here.\nIn sum, it would be inappropriate for this Court to\naddress appellees' Title VI regulation claim. Appellees'\narguments to the contrary are without merit.\nD. The State's use of the PPST does not violate Section 204(d)\nof the EEOA\nAppellees contend (NAACP Br. 47-48) that the State's\nuse of the PPST violates Section 204(d) of the EEOA, 20 U.S.C.\n1703(d), which prohibits \"discrimination by an educational\nagency * * * in the employment, employment conditions, or\nassignment to schools of its faculty.\" This argument ignores\nthe fact that the PPST is used as a basis for admission into\nteacher education programs, not as a basis for hiring. Its\nuse, therefore, does not implicate Section 204(d).\nIn any event, Section 204(d) prohibits only purposeful\ndiscrimination. Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1000-1001\n(5th Cir. 1981). As we explained in our opening brief, there\nis no evidence that the State's use of the PPST reflects\nintentional discrimination (Br. 26-31). For this reason as\nwell, its use does not violate Section 204(d).\n\n- 13 -\nE. The State's use of the PPST does not violate Section 204(f)\nof the EEOA\nAppellees finally contend (NAACP Br. 48) that the\nState's use of the PPST violates Section 204(f) of the EEOA,\n20 U.S.C. 1703(f), which requires an educational agency to\n\"take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that\nimpede equal participation by its students in its instructional\nprograms.\" Regardless of the effect of the PPST, however,\nthe State's educational agencies remain under an obligation\nto provide Mexican-American students with the personnel they\nneed to secure equal educational opportunity. The district\ncourt did not find, and the evidence does not support a\nfinding, that the PPST will disable the State's educational\nagencies from fulfilling this responsibility.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons discussed in this brief as well as those\ndiscussed in our opening brief, the district court's decision\nshould be reversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM.

Whether the district court lacked jurisdiction?\n2. Whether the district court erred in holding that\nappellees were likely to prevail on their claims under the Equal\nProtection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act\nof 1974.\n\n- 2 -\nSTATEMENT\nA. Backaround\nIn 1981, the Texas Legislature enacted a law that requires\nstudents to pass a test on basic skills as a condition of admission\ninto a State approved teacher education program (Texas Education\nCode, Section 13.032). In January 1982, the State Board of Education\nadopted a rule specifying that this requirement would take effect\n1/\non May 1, 1984 (Veselka Dep. 18). In the summer of 1982, the\nState Board decided that the basic skills tested should include\nreading, writing, and arithmetic and that the Pre-Professional Skills\nTest (PPST) should be used to measure these skills provided that\nit could be validated for this purpose (id. at 19-20).\nIn October 1982, the State Board contracted with IOX Associates\nto perform such a validation study (id. at 23). One year later,\nIOX issued its final report concluding that the PPST was valid\n(id. at 24). In February 1984, the State Board formally approved\nthe use of the PPST and established the scores that would be necessary\nto pass the test (id. at 24-25). In March 1984, the test was\ngiven for the first time (id. at 25).\nUnder the Board's regulations, the test is given three times\nevery year, and students are permitted to take the test as many\ntimes as they wish (id. at 27, 29). If a student fails any one of\nl/ \"Dep.\" refers to Deposition; \"Mem.\" refers to the district court's\nMemorandum Opinion; \"Tr.\" refers to Transcript; \"Ex.\" refers to\nExhibit.\n\n-3-\nthe sections of the test, however, he can take no more than six\ncredits of education courses until he passes the test (id. at 79).\nStudents generally begin taking education courses in their junior\nyear.\nThe PPST is designed to test basic skills at the 12th grade\nlevel (Tr. 1182-1183). During the first year of its use, 73% of\nthe whites, 34% of the Hispanics, and 23% of the blacks who took\nthe test passed it (Pltfs,Ex. 10).\nB. Proceedings in the district court\nIn July 1985, appellees (LULAC, GI Forum, NAACP, and a\nnumber of Hispanic and black college students) filed a motion to\nenforce the statewide desegregation decree in United States v.\nState of Texas, 447 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1971) (Motion to Enforce\nDecree filed on July 19, 1985). That case began in 1971 as a suit\nto desegregate nine all-black school districts. The case was then\nexpanded and resulted in a decree requiring the State to assume\nresponsibility for the desegregation of public schools throughout\nTexas.\nIn their motion, appellees alleged that the State's use of\nthe PPST violated provisions in the decree that required the State\nto provide Hispanic and black students in the public schools with\naccess to minority teachers (id. at 1-2). In addition, appellees\nalleged that the use of the test violated the rights of students\nseeking admission into teacher education programs under the Equal\nProtection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil\n\n-4-\nRights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d), the Equal Educational Oppor-\ntunities Act (20 U.S.C. 1703), and the contract between the United\nStates and the State of Texas guaranteeing equal education oppor-\ntunity in higher education (id. at 2-3).\nAppellees immediately moved for a preliminary injunction\npreventing the State from using the test as a barrier to admission\nto teacher education programs. After a hearing, the district\ncourt granted this motion (Memorandum Opinion filed on August 27,\n1985).\nC. The district court's decision\n1. Jurisdiction\nThe court first determined that its authority to enforce\nthe decree in United States v. State of Texas gave it jurisdiction\nto resolve appellees' motion. The court acknowledged that its\nprevious orders \"did not deal specifically with the adoption of\nthe PPST\" (Mem. 14). The court concluded, however, that the\nState's use of the PPST could frustrate the purpose of that decree.\nAccording to the court, the purpose of the decree was to enforce\nthe State's obligation to create a unitary system and this obligation\nincludes a duty to provide minority children with \"minority role\nmodels\" (id. at 14-16). Since the court found \"[a]mple evidence\"\nthat the use of the PPST would \"greatly diminish[]\" the number of\nminority teachers, the court was convinced that it had jurisdiction\nto consider the merits of appellees' attack on it (id. at 16-17).\n\n-5--\nThe court also concluded that the PPST issue fell within\nthe confines of its previous order requiring local school districts\nto use \"non-racial, non-ethnic criteria in hiring\" (id. at 17).\nThe court pointed out that if a local school district had adopted\nthe PPST as a prerequisite to hiring, the court clearly would\nhave had jurisdiction to consider whether the local district\nhad violated this provision (id. at 18-19). The court reasoned\nit should make no difference for purposes of jurisdiction that\nthe PPST requirement is State rather than locally imposed (id. at 19).\nBased on this analysis, the court not only assumed jurisdic-\ntion over appellees' claim that the State had violated the terms\nof the decree, it also assumed jurisdiction over appellees' claims\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI,\nand the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (id. at 19). The court\nrefused to consider appellees' claim that the State had violated\nits agreement to provide equal education opportunity in higher\neducation, however (id. at 19). The court explained that \"[t]he\nprogress of the State of Texas in ensuring equal educational oppor-\ntunity in colleges and universities is, jurisdictionally speaking,\nnot a concern of this court\" (id. at 20).\n2. The merits of the motion\nIn deciding to grant a preliminary injunction against use\nof the PPST, the court considered four factors: (1) the harm to\nappellees in denying an injunction; (2) the harm to the State in\n\n-6-\ngranting an injunction; (3) the public interest; and (4) the proba-\nbility that appellees would prevail on the merits (id. at 20 citing\nCamenisch v. University of Texas, 616 F.2d 127, 130 (5th Cir.\n1980)).\n'The court first found that unless an injunction were issued,\nmany students would have to postpone completion of their education\ncourses for at least six months to one year (id. at 21). This, in\nturn, would deprive students in public schools of minority teachers\n\"at a time when the state is experiencing a significant teacher\nshortage\" (ibid.). For this reason, the court concluded, appellees\nhad established irreparable harm (id. at 22).\nOn the other hand, the court found that the State would not\nsuffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction were granted.\nThe State argued that an injunction would permit students without\nthe necessary skills to take courses, would negatively affect public\nperception, and would be unfair to students who take courses only to\nfind out later that they must still pass the PPST (id. at 22). In\nthe court's view, \"none of these 'harms' [was] persuasive\" (id. at\n23). The court found that students who failed the PPST would be\nable to learn the material in their courses, that negative\npublic perception was irrelevant, and that students could make an\ninformed choice on whether to take education courses knowing that\nthey still might have to pass the PPST (id. at 23-24).\n\n-7-\nThe court concluded that the public interest also weighed\nin favor of granting an injunction. The court explained that\nsince its injunction would only permit students to enroll in courses\nand would not permit them to become certified, the public's interest\nin competent teachers was not implicated (id. at 24-25). In contrast,\nthe court found that the public's interest in alleviating the\nteacher shortage would be served by granting an injunction (id. at\n25).\nThe court finally determined that appellees were likely\nto prevail on the merits. The court recognized that to prevail on\ntheir Equal Protection claim, appellees were required to show that\nthe State had adopted the PPST with a racially discriminatory\npurpose (id. at 26). in the court's view, however, \"the most\nreliable way to determine discriminatory intent in a school desegre-\ngation case is to look at the reasonably foreseeable results of the\nactions being challenged\" (id. at 32). The court therefore viewed\nthe State's awareness that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact on black and Hispanic students as proof of discriminatory\nintent (id. at 27, 32).\nThe court also relied on several other factors as evidence\nof discriminatory intent. The court found that \"the historical\nbackground of [the] decision [was] one of repeated and recent instances\nof intentional segregation, particularly in areas of South Texas\nwhere there is a substantial Mexican-American population\" (id. at\n27). The court also found it significant that the State had failed\n\n-8-\nto attempt \"to discover whether the test itself was the source of\nthe impact or whether alternative tests existed\" (ibid.). The\ncourt was especially critical of the State's failure to \"organize\nany sort of remediation program specifically directed at preparing\nminority students for the PPST\" (id. at 27-28). In the court's\nview, \"[t]he state's passivity seem[ed] particularly callous in the\nface of the almost heroic efforts made by colleges and universities\nwith heavy minority concentrations hastily to devise makeshift\nremediation programs of their own\" (id. at 31-32).\nIn addition, the court found it \"[p]articularly disturbing\"\nthat the State had instituted an alternative certification procedure\nin response to teacher shortages resulting from the PPST (id. at\n29). Under this procedure, those graduating from college and\npassing the PPST will be allowed to teach without any courses in\nteacher education. According to the court, \"[t]he choice to sacri-\nfice the requirement of two years of training specifically directed\nat being a teacher, * * * rather than change the PPST preclusionary\nscores or petition the Legislature to allow waiver of the PPST\nrequirement, was one of the strongest indications of racial intent\npresented at the hearing\" (id. at 29).\nAs the court viewed the testimony of the State's witnesses,\nthe State's conduct seemed to have \"sprung from an attitude that\nminority students were themselves to blame for their poor performance\"\n(id. at 30-31). That attitude, the court found, was evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent (id. at 31). Finally, the court found it\n\n-9-\n\"extremely significant\" that the State Board was composed of 27\nmembers, with only one black and three Hispanic members (id. at\n32-33). As the court saw it, \"[t]his factor adds weight to [appel-\nlees'] claims of intentional discrimination, for these minority\nmembers could get no more response to their concerns about minority\nimpact than the appointment of an apparently powerless committee\nwhich met once and dissolved\" (id. at 33). The court concluded\nthat the evidence \"strongly suggests\" that the State acted with\ndiscriminatory intent in adopting the PPST and that appellees were\ntherefore likely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Protection\nClause (id. at 34).\nThe court also held that appellees were likely to prevail\non their Due Process claim. The court understood that to\nestablish a violation of the Due Process Clause, appellees were\nrequired to establish a protected liberty or property interest\n(id. at 34). The court found it unlikely that appellees would be\nable to establish a protected property interest (ibid.). The\ncourt held that since colleges and universities have always had a\nlarge measure of discretion to determine their own admission and\ncertification standards, the State had not created any property\ninterest in becoming certified as a teacher (id. at 35). The court\nconcluded, however, that the students did have a constitutionally\nprotected liberty interest \"in being able to pursue the occupation\nof their choice\" and that this interest was implicated since the\n\"[f]ailure to pass the PPST unequivocally deprives a student of\nthe opportunity to teach in Texas\" (id. at 35-36).\n\n- 10 -\nThe court held that although the scope of this Due Process\nright was unclear, it necessarily included a right to \"reasonable\nnotice of the state's requirement\" (id. at 36). The court found\nthat \"the students and teacher education programs were given very\nlittle notice of the PPST requirement and the proposed preclusionary\nscores,\" and \"no materials to help prepare for the PPST beyond a\npamphlet\" (id. at 37). For this reason, the court concluded that\nappellees were \"likely to prove that the [State] deprived them of\ntheir right to teach in Texas, without sufficient notice concerning\nthe nature and imminence of the PPST\" (id. at 38).\nThe court held that the Due Process Clause also required the\nState to show that \"students in Texas had been taught the materials\ncovered in the PPST\" (ibid. citing Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d\n397, 404 (5th Cir. 1981)). After reviewing the State's effort to\nmake this showing, as well as appellees' criticisms of that attempt,\nthe court concluded that \"insufficient evidence ha[d] been presented\non which to decide the likelihood of [appellees'] success on [this\nissue]\" (id. at 38-41).\nThe court next considered appellees' claim that the use of\nthe PPST violated the prohibition in Title VI against discrimina-\ntion in federally assisted programs. The court held that since\nthe teacher education programs receive federal financial assistance\nand Title VI affords individuals a private right of action, appellees\ncould attack the PPST under Title VI (id. at 41-45). After noting\n\n- 11 -\nthat appellees had shown a likelihood of success on their constitu-\ntional claim, the court held that \"this likelihood extends to their\ncause of action under [Title VI]\" (id. at 45).\nFinally, the court considered appellees' claim that the\nState had failed \"to take affirmative steps * * * to remove the\nvestiges of a dual school system\" as required by the Equal Educa-\ntional Opportunities Act (ibid.). As the court understood this provi-\nsion, the State could not use the PPST to prevent students who\nstill suffered the effects of the dual system from entering teacher\neducation programs (id. at 46-47). The court found that the limited\nevidence introduced at the hearing on this issue indicated that\nthe test was being applied to such students (id. at 47). The\ncourt therefore concluded that appellees had shown \"a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits of this claim\" (id. at 46-47).\nBased on its findings under the four factors (harm to\nappellees, harm to the State, the public interest, and likelihood\nof success), the district court issued a preliminary injunction\nrequiring the State to \"permit colleges and universities in the\nState of Texas to admit those students, regardless of race, to\ncourses in their Education Departments who would have been qualified\nto enroll in those courses but for their failing the [PPST]\"\n(Preliminary Injunction filed on August 27, 1985). From this\norder, the State of Texas and the United States have appealed.\n\n- 12 -\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nAppellees have challenged the State's authority to use a\nbasic skills test (the PPST) as a condition of admission into\nteacher education programs. After a hearing, the district court\ngranted appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction against\nfurther use of the test. We believe the district court erred in\ntwo important ways.\n1. Most fundamentally, the district court lacked jurisdiction\nover appellees' challenge. Appellees asserted jurisdiction under\nthe statewide desegregation decree in United States v. State of\nTexas, and the district court assumed jurisdiction entirely on that\nbasis. The State of Texas decree only requires the State to take\nresponsibility for the desegregation of elementary and secondary\nschools, however. It does not limit the State's authority in the\nfield of higher education. Since the PPST is used in colleges and\nuniversities and not in the elementary and secondary schools, the\nState of Texas decree did not give the district court jurisdiction\nto review appellees' challenge to it.\nThe district court held that minority students in the\nelementary and secondary schools have a constitutional right to\nminority teachers and that the PPST indirectly affects that right.\nBut this Court has repeatedly held that minority students have no\nsuch right. And while it is true that the PPST may ultimately\naffect the number of minority teachers, that is not a basis for\nexercising jurisdiction over a claim of discrimination in college\nadmissions. School desegregation remedies are necessarily limited\n\n- 13 -\nto eliminating discrimination that actually occurs in the public\nschools. They cannot embrace State action that occurs elsewhere\nsimply because it may indirectly affect the students in those\nschools.\n2. The district court also erred in holding that appellees\nwere likely to \nprevail on the merits. To establish a violation of\nEqual Protection, appellees were required to prove that the State's\nuse of the PPST was motivated by racially discriminatory intent.\nWhile the district court purported to follow this principle, it\nheld that the most reliable way to determine intent was to examine\nthe reasonably foreseeable results of the State's action. That\nstandard is inconsistent with controlling Supreme Court decisions\nwhich hold that it is improper to equate intent with foreseeability.\nThe available evidence does not permit an inference of\ndiscriminatory intent. The State legislation requiring competency\ntesting of basic skills was designed to improve teacher quality,\nnot to diminish the number of minority teachers. And the State\nBoard's adoption and implementation of the PPST was motivated by an\nintent to faithfully carry out the legislative mandate. Indeed,\nthe State Board did not finally approve the use of the PPST until\nit received a report that the test was a valid measure of the\nskills needed for success in teacher training and for success as a\nteacher. The evidence cited by the district court merely shows\nthat the State knew that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact and that it decided to use it anyway. That is not a\nsufficient basis for an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n- 14 -\nThe court's holding that appellees were likely to show\nthat the State deprived them of their liberty interest in pursuing\nthe occupation of their choice without adequate notice is also in\nerror. This Court has held that general standards of uniform\napplication do not ordinarily trigger any requirement of individual\nnotice and opportunity to be heard. Moreover, this Court has held\nthat procedural Due Process, although applicable to university\ndecisions concerning student misconduct, is not fully applicable\nto academic decisions. Finally, this Court has held that while\nthere is a liberty interest in pursuing an occupation, that interest\nis not significantly implicated when there is an opportunity to\nretake the test. Although requirements that are wholly arbitrary\nor capricious violate Due Process, the district court failed to\narticulate why it would be arbitrary or capricious to give college\nstudents a test on 12th grade level basic skills without prior\nnotice. In any event, the legislation itself, the Board's\nregulations implementing the statute, and the colleges' catalogues\nall gave notice of the testing requirement long before the test\nwas first given.\nThe district court also erred in holding that appellees were\nlikely to prevail on their Title VI claim. The court's Title VI\nholding is based entirely on its prior finding of a probable Equal\nProtection violation. Since the court's Title VI analysis tracks\nits Equal Protection analysis, it suffers from the same errors.\n\n- 15 -\nFinally, \nthe district court erred in holding that appellees\nwere likely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Educational\nOpportunities Act (\"EEOA\"). The EEOA's remedial obligations extend\nonly to elementary and secondary schools. While 20 U.S.C. 1703(b),\non which the court relied, requires the dismantling of dual systems\n\"root and branch,\" it imposes no duty upon higher educational auth-\norities to compensate students for the academic deficiencies which\nmay be vestiges of past segregation in the first twelve grades.\nIndeed, colleges and universities are not required, either by the\nConstitution or by the EEOA, to lower their entrance standards to\naccommodate those students whose failure to meet minimum standards\nmay be, in part, a consequence of past discrimination in elementary\nor secondary education.\nThe court's reliance on Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d\nCir. \n397 (5th  1981), is misplaced. In that case, this Court held\nthat students who complete a high school course to the satisfaction\nof their own schools are normally entitled to expect to receive a\ndiploma. For this reason, this Court concluded, the state that\npracticed segregation during the school-life of these students\nshould not permit the consequences of that segregation to stand\nbetween the students and their diplomas. But this has no bearing\non the present case.\nEntrance into a professional school is not part of the\nnormal expectations of all students who complete high school.\nMoreover, if the district court's logic were accepted, it -would\nmean that any state that practiced segregation in the past could\nnot set minimum standards for entry into any profession. All such\nstandards could be said to penalize the victims of prior segregation.\n\n- 16 -\nThe application of Debra P. to professional standards for teachers\nis particularly inappropriate. Here what arguably may be fair\nto would-be teachers is unfair to those who will be taught. If\nthe state is required to accept into the teaching profession those\nwho cannot satisfy minimum standards, it will not remedy but perpet-\nuate the effects of past discrimination (if any) by allowing academic\ndeficiency to be passed from one generation to the next.\nIn any event, there is no evidence from which a court could\nconclude that there has been widespread school segregation in\nTexas upon which current academic deficiencies could be blamed.\nAnd even if there were, Debra P. held that a test having disparate\nimpact traceable to past discrimination can be justified if it\nhas a remedial function. Where students are spurred by the test\nto upgrade their skills, the test vindicates its usefulness. That\nis ultimately what happened in Debra P.; there is ample evidence\nthat the same is true in the present case.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT LACKED JURISDICTION\nTO CONSIDER APPELLEES' CHALLENGE TO THE\nSTATE'S USE OF THE PPST\nAppellees have challenged the State's use of the PPST\nas a condition of admission into teacher education programs.\nAppellees did not file a complaint attacking the State's require-\nment, however. Instead, they filed a motion to enforce the state-\nwide desegregation decree in United States v. State of Texas. The\ndistrict court concluded that appellees' motion fell within its\n\n- 17 -\nauthority to enforce that decree and assumed jurisdiction over\nappellees' claims entirely on that basis. As we argued below,\nappellees' challenge to the State's use of the PPST does not impli-\ncate the decree in United States v. State of Texas. The district\ncourt should therefore have dismissed appellees' motion for lack\nof jurisdiction.\nAs this Court recently explained, United States v. State\nof Texas began as a suit to desegregate nine all-black school\ndistricts (680 F.2d 356, 358 (1982)). The case was then expanded\nand resulted in a decree directing the State to assume responsibility\nfor the desegregation of public schools throughout Texas (ibid.).\nWhile this decree is undeniably broad, it is limited to curing the\nviolation identified in that case -- racial segregation in the\nelementary and secondary schools throughout the State. United\nStates v. State of Texas did not involve allegations of discrimina-\ntion against black and Hispanic students in colleges and universities,\nand the decree therefore does not purport to circumscribe the State's\nauthority in that area. Nor could it. Under well established\nprinciples, judicial remedial authority can \"extend no farther\nthan required by the nature and extent of th[e] violation.\" General\nBuilding Contractors Assn. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 399\n(1982). Since the violation identified in United States v. State\nof Texas concerned the elementary and secondary schools, the\nremedy was required to be similarly limited.\n\n- 18 -\nThe district court's assumption of jurisdiction is inconsis-\ntent with this understanding of the United States v. State of\nTexas decree. Appellees' challenge to the State's use of the PPST\nthreatens the State's authority over colleges and universities,\nnot its authority over the public schools. The PPST is used as a\ncondition of admission into college and university education programs;\nit is not used in the State's elementary and secondary schools.\nIf the State's use of the PPST violates anyone's rights, it is the\nrights of college students seeking admission into teacher education\nprograms, not those of students attending elementary and secondary\nschools. In these circumstances, the district court had no basis\nfor asserting jurisdiction under the United States v. State of\nTexas decree.\nIn reaching a contrary conclusion, the district court\nheld that the State's use of the PPST might undermine one of the\npurposes of its decree. According to the court, one purpose of\nits decree was to enforce the State's constitutional obligation to\nprovide minority children with \"minority role models\" (Mem. 14-16).\nSince the court found that the PPST would have the effect of\ndiminishing the number of minority teachers, it felt compelled to\nconsider appellees' attack on it.\nThis reasoning is fundamentally flawed. To be sure, this\nCourt has held that discrimination in the assignment and hiring of\nteachers violates the constitutional rights of students, and\nhas insisted that desegregation remedies include a prohibition\nagainst that kind of discrimination. See Singleton v. Jackson\n\n- 19 -\nMunicipal Separate School District, 419 F.2d 1211, 1218 (1970).\nBut this Court has repeatedly held that students do not have a\nconstitutional right to minority teachers per se. Fort Bend Indepen-\ndent School District v. Stafford, 651 F.2d 1133, 1139-1140 (1981)\n(citing cases). And it has never come close to suggesting that\nstudents in the public schools have a constitutional right to have\ncollege students admitted into teacher education programs on a\nnondiscriminatory basis. To take that leap now would stretch\nthe principle involved in Singleton beyond recognition.\nIt is true that if minority students are excluded from\nteacher education programs in disproportionate numbers, it may\nreduce the number of minority teachers in the public schools and\nthis, in turn, may affect the minority students attending those\nschools. But that is not a proper basis for exercising jurisdiction\nover appellees' claims. The remedy in a school desegregation case\nmust be designed to eliminate racial discrimination that actually\noccurs in the public schools. Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\n433 U.S. 406, 419-420 (1977) (Dayton I). School desegregation cases\nare not general forums for reviewing all claims of racial discrimi-\nnation that can be said to have some effect on students attending\nthose schools.\nIndeed, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1, 22 (1971), the Supreme Court expressly rejected that\nkind of expansive notion of the role of a federal court in a school\n\n- 20 -\ndesegregation case. The Court explained that (id. at 22):\nWe are concerned in these cases with the elimina-\ntion of the discrimination inherent in the dual\nschool systems, not with myriad factors of human\nexistence which can cause discrimination in a\nmultitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic\ngrounds. The target of the cases from Brown I\nto the present was the dual school system. \nThe\nelimination of racial discrimination in public\nschools is a large task and one that should not\nbe retarded by efforts to achieve broader purposes\n* * *• One vehicle can carry only a limited amount\nof baggage. It would not serve the important\nobjective of Brown I to seek to use school dese-\ngregation cases for purposes beyond their scope.\nThe Court went on to stress that the objective in a school\ndesegregation case \"is to see that school authorities exclude no\npupil of a racial minority from any school, directly or indirectly,\non account of race; it does not and cannot embrace all the problems\nof racial prejudice, even when those problems contribute to\ndisproportionate racial concentrations in some schools. Id. at 23\n(emphasis added).\nThe principles established in Swann are controlling here.\nAt its core, appellees' complaint is that the State's use of the\nPPST violates the rights of college students seeking admission\ninto teacher education programs. The State's policy will admittedly\nhave an indirect effect on minority students attending public\nschools. But this fact alone cannot transform a higher education\ncase into a public school desegregation case.\nAt one point, the district court recognized that it had no\nauthority over the State's activities in the field of higher\neducation. In refusing to exercise jurisdiction over appellees'\n\n- 21 -\nclaim that the State's use of the PPST violated its agreement to\nprovide equal education opportunity in higher education, the court\nexplained that \"[t]he progress of the State of Texas in ensuring\nequal educational opportunity in colleges and universities is,\njurisdictionally speaking, not a concern of this court\" (Mem. 20).\nThis statement is exactly right. Rather than simply leading the\ncourt to refuse jurisdiction over appellees' claim that the State\nhad breached its higher education agreement, however, it should\nhave led the court to decline jurisdiction over all of appellees'\nclaims.\nThis Court has recently noted that under the authority of\nthe United States v State of Texas decree, the district court\nhas engaged in a \"general undertaking to supervise broad aspects\nof Texas' educational system and policy.\" United States v. •State\nof Texas, supra, 680 F.2d at 358. While this Court approved\nthe court's authority to continue to enforce outstanding orders,\nit cautioned the district court to avoid extending its authority\ninto new areas that do not come within the specific terms of the\ndecree. Id. at 374. the district court failed to heed this caution.\nIn sum, the district court's authority to enforce its decree\nin United States v. State of Texas did not give it jurisdiction\nto decide the merits of appellees' attack on the State's use of\nthe PPST. This Court should therefore vacate the district court's\npreliminary injunction and remand with directions to dismiss\n\n- 22 -\n2/\nappellees' motion to enforce the decree.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT\nAPPELLEES WERE LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE\nMERITS\nEven assuming the district court had jurisdiction, it should\nnot have granted appellees' motion for preliminary relief. To\nprevail on their motion, appellees were required to show: (1) a\nsubstantial likelihood that they would prevail on the merits; (2)\nthat they would suffer irreparable injury; (3) that this injury\noutweighed any harm to the State; and (4) that a preliminary\ninjunction would serve the public interest. Canal Authority of the\nState of Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir. 1974).\nWhether or not appellees carried their burden on the other factors,\nthey most assuredly did not establish a likelihood of success on\nthe merits. While the district court held that appellees had\nshown probable violations of the Equal Protection Clause, the Due\nProcess Clause, Title VI, and the Equal Educational Opportunities\nAct, those holdings are in error.\n2/ As an alternative ground for assuming jurisdiction, the district\ncourt held that the PPST issue fell within its order requiring\nnon-racial, non-ethnic criteria to be used in hiring (Mem. 17).\nThis conclusion is incorrect. The order referred to by the court\nsimply directs the State to \"require each county or local educational\nagency [applying for State funds] to include * * * a list of objec-\ntive, non-racial, and non-ethnic criteria * * * by which it will\njudge prospective employees for faculty and staff positions.\"\nState of Texas, supra, 447 F.2d at 446. The order thus concerns\nthe kind of criteria local districts must use in making hiring\ndecisions. It has nothing to do with the kind of criteria the\nState must use in formulating college admission standards.\n\n- 23 -\nA. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their claim under the Eaual Protection Clause\nIn the first year of its administration, 73% of the whites,\n34% of the Hispanics, and 23% of the blacks who took the PPST passed\nit. These statistics lie at the heart of appellees' claim that the\n3/\nState's use of PPST violates the Equal Protection Clause.\nOf course, it is now well established that a law or other\nofficial act will not be held unconstitutional solely because it has\na racially disproportionate impact. Personnel Administrator v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426\nU.S. 229, 239 (1976). A violation of equal protection can be found\nonly if the impact \"can be traced to a racially discriminatory\npurpose.\" Feeney, supra, 442 U.S. at 272. In Davis, the Supreme\nCourt upheld a police department's employment test, even though it\nscreened out four times as many blacks as whites. In Arlington\nHeights, the Court upheld a municipality's zoning decision even\nthough it tended to perpetuate racially segregated housing patterns.\nAnd in Feeney, a case involving an allegation of sex rather than race\ndiscrimination, the Court upheld a state's veterans preference\neven though it made all but 2% of the women in the state ineligible\nfor state civil service jobs.\n3(cid:9) During the past year, there has been significant improvement in\nblack and Hispanic pass rates (Tr. 827, 1516). This trend can be\nexpected to continue. Indeed, one educator from a predominantly\nminority institution predicted that 70% of this year's freshmen would\neventually pass the test (Tr. 828). Thus, while the PPST may\ncontinue to have a disparate effect for some time, the statistics\ncited above considerably overstate the likely magnitude of that\neffect.\n\n- 24 -\nThe district court purported to follow the principle\ninvolved in these cases. Thus, the district court stated that\n\"[in order to prevail on their claim that the imposition of the\nPPST and the determination of preclusionary scores violated the\nEqual \nProtection clause [appellees] must show that [the State]\nacted with discriminatory intent or purpose\" (Mem. 26).(cid:9) The\ndistrict court went on to hold, however, \"that the most reliable\nway to determine discriminatory intent in a school desegregation\ncase is to look at the reasonably foreseeable results of the actions\nbeing challenged\" (id. at 32).\nThis holding is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision\nin Feeney . In that case, the lower court, relying on the same fore-\nseeability standard applied by the district court here, found that\nthe state's veterans preference reflected intentional discrimination\nagainst women. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the lower\ncourt had applied the wrong legal standard. The Court explained\nthat discriminatory purpose \"implies more than intent as volition\nor intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the\ndecisionmaker * * •} selected or reaffirmed a particular course of\naction at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,'\nits adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" 442 U.S. at 279.\nIn adopting a foreseeability standard for determining\ndiscriminatory intent, the district court relied on this Court's\ndecision in United States v. Texas Education Agency, 579 F.2d 910\n913-914 (1978). That decision, however, came before the Supreme\nCourt's decision in Feeney. To the extent that language in that\n\n- 25 -\nopinion suggests that it would be appropriate to equate intent\nwith foreseeability, it is inconsistent with Feeney and should not\nbe followed.\nAppellees appear to suggest that Feeney does not apply to\nrace discrimination cases (Response to Stay Motion 11). But in\nFeeney itself, the Court made clear that the same standard of\nintent governs both sex and race discrimination cases.\n442 U.S. at 273-274. And the Court has since applied the Feeney\ntest of intent in a race discrimination case. Washington v.\nSeattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 471 (1982).\nThe decisions in Columbus Board of Education v. Penick,\n443 U.S. 449 (1979) and Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\n443 U.S. 526 (1979)(Dayton II), cited by appellees, are not con-\ntrary. Indeed, in Dayton II, the Court expressly rejected the\nSixth Circuit's holding that a presumption of segregative purpose\narises from proof that actions have had a foreseeably segregative\neffect. 443 U.S. at 536 n.9. The Court explained that (ibid.):\n(w)e have never held that as a general proposition\nthe foreseeability of segregative consequences\nmakes out a prima facie case of purposeful racial\ndiscrimination and shifts the burden of producing\nevidence to the defendants if they are to escape\njudgment; and even more clearly there is no warrant\nin our cases for holding that such foreseeability\nroutinely shifts the burden of persuasion to the\ndefendants.\nOf course, as the Supreme Court has made clear, foresee-\nability of disparate impact is one kind of relevant evidence on the\nissue of discriminatory purpose. Dayton II, 443 U.S. at 536 n.9;\n\n- 26 -\nColumbus, 443 U.S. at 464-465. But that is far different from\nsaying, as the district court did, that foreseeability is tantamount\nto, or is the most reliable way to determine, discriminatory intent.\nThus, to establish a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause, appellees were required to show that the State adopted\nand implemented the PPST \"because of\" rather than merely \"in spite\nof\" its effect on black and Hispanic students seeking admission\ninto teacher education programs. The fact that the State knew\nfrom its pilot testing that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact on black and Hispanic students, while relevant on this\nissue, is far from proof of such a purpose.\nThe district court never found that appellees were likely to\nshow that the State's use of the PPST reflected intentional discrimina-\ntion in the sense demanded by Feeney. Nor is such a finding possible.\nThe State Board's adoption of the PPST was a direct response\nto legislation requiring that students pass a test on basic skills\nas a condition of admission into teacher education programs. The\nlegislature acted against the background of reports that the quality\nof students entering the teaching profession had been declining\nover time and that many now lacked the basic skills necessary to\nperform satisfactorily as teachers (Kirby Dep.'8-9). By requiring\ncompetency testing, the legislature sought to reverse this trend\nand to insure that the State's future teachers would have the\nnecessary basic skills (ibid.). The legislature's rationale for\nrequiring students to pass the test before entering teacher education\n\n- 27 -\nprograms was that students not only need basic skills to become\nsuccessful teachers, they also need them to profit from teacher\neducation courses (id. at 18-19). The legitimacy of these legisla-\ntive judgments is beyond dispute.\nAppellees have never suggested otherwise. Instead, appellees\nclaim that while the legislature's decision to impose competency\ntesting may have been motivated by a legitimate desire to improve\nteacher quality, the State Board's adoption and implementation\nof the PPST was motivated by an intent to diminish the number of\nminority teachers. The record does not support this claim.\nThe undisputed evidence shows that the State Board responded\nto the legislature's mandate as follows: The Board first determined\nthat the basic skills tested should include reading, writing and\narithmetic (Veselka Dep. 19). After considering a number of possible\ntests to measure these skills (id. at 19-20), the Board tentatively\nselected the PPST because it was the only test on the market speci-\nfically designed to test these skills at the level needed for\nentry into teacher education programs (id. at 60-61). Thereafter,\nthe Board hired IOX Associates to determine whether the PPST was\nvalid for its intended purpose (id. at 23). After IOX Associates\nissued a detailed report concluding that the PPST did measure\nskills needed for successful training and job performance, the\nBoard formally approved its use (id. at 24-25; Pltfs. Ex. 1, pp.\n24-27). At the same time, the Board adopted passing scores of\n51% for the math section, 55% for the reading section, and 58%\n\n- 28 -\nfor the writing section (Pltfs. Ex. 4;). Finally, the Board estab-\nlished a rule that students could take the test an unlimited number\nof times (Veselka Dep. 28-29). Nothing in this sequence of events\nremotely suggests that the Board's actions were governed by a\ndesire to prevent blacks \nand Hispanics from becoming teachers.\nThe district court found that the historical background of\nthe decision was one of \"repeated and recent instances of intentional\nsegregation, particularly in areas of South Texas where there is a\nsubstantial Mexican-American population\" (Mein. 27). The court did\nnot cite any evidence, however, to support this finding. The court\ndid cite two of this Court's decisions as support for its conclusion:\nUnited States v. Texas Education Agency, 679 F.2d 1104 (5th Cir.\n1982) (Port Arthur) and United States v. Texas Education Agency\n647 F.2d 504 (5th Cir. 1981) (South Park). But these cases involved\nallegations that local school districts had failed to fully desegre-\ngate their black students: Neither of these cases involved allega-\ntions of purposeful segregation against Mexican-Americans and\nneither case implicated the State in any way. The district court's\nfinding on this point is therefore clearly erroneous.\nThe district court also found that the Board's failure to\nconsider alternative tests after it learned that the PPST would\nhave a disproportionate impact was evidence of discriminatory intent.\nBut the proper inquiry is whether the test selected by the Board\nwas prompted by a legitimate purpose. Having selected a test\nthat was designed to measure the skills it thought necessary,\n\n- 29 -\nand having received a report that the test in fact measured those\nskills, the Board had no obligation to search for a test that\nwould maximize the minority pass rate. See Furnco Const.\nCorp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577-578 (1978).\t Moreover, the\nBoard had already considered a wide range of alternative tests\nbefore adopting the PPST and had rejected them because they were\nnot designed to measure the skills needed for entry into teacher\neducation programs (Veselka Dep. 60-61). In any event, appellees\nintroduced no evidence that there was another test in existence\nthat could measure the skills the Board thought necessary without\nproducing a similar disproportionate effect. See Albemarle Paper\nCo. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975). Thus, the Board's decision\nto proceed with the PPST, rather than considering other tests,\nclearly does not constitute proof of purposeful discrimination.\nThe district court also concluded that the State's failure\nto develop a remedial program specifically directed at preparing\nminority students for the PPST raised an inference of discriminatory\npurpose. The State's obligation under the Equal Protection Clause,\nhowever, is to establish legitimate standards that are adopted and\nadministered without regard to race. It has no general duty to\nengage in affirmative action to help those who have been unable to\nsatisfy those standards. A state may, of course, voluntarily\nundertake such efforts; to hold that its failure to do so raises an\ninference of discriminatory intent, however, would impose indirectly\nan obligation the court may not impose directly.\n\n- 30 -\nIn any event, the State of Texas maintains a full network\nof junior colleges that offer remedial instruction in basic skills.\nWhile these programs were not specifically designed to help students\npass the PPST, they do attempt to teach the basic skills that it\ntests. These programs may not be as effective as those devised by\nsome of the senior colleges. But whatever their shortcomings,\nthey are not evidence of discriminatory intent.\nThe district court found it \"particularly disturbing\" that\nin responding to a teacher shortage, the State decided to\nallow college graduates who pass the PPST to become teachers without\nhaving to take teacher training. The State could certainly conclude,\nhowever, that it was more important for prospective teachers to\nhave basic skills than formal teacher training. Such a bona fide\neducational decision made by competent state officials cannot be\nevidence of discriminatory intent.\nThe district court found that the State had displayed an\nattitude that minorities had only themselves to blame for their\npoor performance. In support of this finding, the district court\ncited the testimony of Dr. Bergin, the Deputy Commissioner of Educa-\ntion. In her testimony, Dr. Bergin did not attempt to explain the\nreason for the disparity in performance among racial groups. Instead,\nshe offered her views on why people of all races have failed the\ntest (Tr. 1629). As the district court found, she gave three reasons:\nlack of intellectual ability, failure to work hard in class, and\nteachers' lack of basic skills (ibid.). These three reasons may not\n\n- 31 -\nexhaust the universe of possible explanations for failure on the\ntest. But they certainly do not supply \nany reason to believe that\nDr. Bergin's support for \nthe PPST was motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\nFinally, the district court found it \"extremely significant\"\nthat at the time the Board adopted the PPST, it consisted of 27\nmembers, only one of whom was black and only three of whom were\nHispanic. There is no basis in law or logic, however, for\npresuming that a legislative or administrative body that is\npredominantly of one race has acted with discriminatory intent.\nCf. Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 499 (1977).(cid:9) Indeed, if\nthe racial composition of a legislative or administrative body\nwere a sufficient reason for an inference of discriminatory intent,\nfew decisions could survive judicial review.\nIn sum, none of the evidence relied upon by the district\ncourt suggests that appellees will be able to show that the Board\nadopted and implemented the PPST requirement with discriminatory\nintent. The district court's finding that the evidence \"strongly\nsuggests\" that the Board acted with discriminatory intent is based\non an improper legal standard and is clearly erroneous.\nB. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their Due Process claim\nTo invoke the protection of the Due Process Clause, appellees\nwere required to show that the State's use of the PPST deprived\nthem of either a \"liberty\" or \"property\" interest. Board of Regents\n\n- 32 -\nv. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972). The district court held that\nappellees had a liberty interest in pursuing the occupation of\ntheir choice and that the State's use of the PPST deprived them of\nthat interest. According to the court, appellees' liberty interest\nentitled them to adequate notice of the PPST requirement. Finding\nthat the State had given appellees little notice and no materials\non the nature of the requirement other than a pamphlet, the court\nconcluded that appellees were likely to prevail on their Due Process\nclaim. The court's analysis is seriously deficient.\nTo begin with, the district court's reasoning fails to take\ninto account that when a state adopts a uniform standard of general\napplicability, such as a competency test of basic skills, it does\nnot ordinarily trigger any requirement that procedural due process\nbe accorded to each affected person individually. It is only when\nthe standards are structured to require more individualized deter-\nminations in their application -- such as findings of good character\n-- that individual notice and an opportunity to be heard are required.\nIn Nolan v. Ramsey, 597 F.2d 577 (5th Cir. 1979), this\nCourt applied this principle in rejecting a Due Process challenge\nto a state commission's decision to replace stenomask reporters\nwith stenographers. This Court explained that procedural due\nprocess only applies \"where an individual is singled out and denied\nthe right to pursue a profession or occupation based upon personal\ncharacteristics.\" Id. at 580. Since the commission's decision\napplied uniformly to all stenomask reporters, this Court held,\nprocedural Due Process was not required. Ibid.\n\n- 33 -\nSecond, the district court's reasoning ignores the distinction\nthis Court has drawn between \"a court's power to review disciplinary\nactions by educational institutions on the one hand, and academic\ndecisions on the other hand.\" Mahavongsanan V. Hall, 529 F.2d\n448, 449 (1976). \nIn Mahavongsanan, this Court expressly upheld a\nstate university's decision to deny a master's degree to an individ-\nual who had failed a comprehensive examination, even though the\nuniversity had failed to give her notice and an opportunity to be\nheard. This Court explained that while prior decisions recognized\nthat students were entitled to certain procedural Due Process\nprotections, those cases \"have been carefully limited to disciplinary\ndecisions.\" Id. at 449. The Court went on to state that \"'[we] know\nof no case which holds that colleges and universities are subject\nto the supervision or review of the courts in the uniform application\nof their academic standards.'\" Id. at 449-450 (quoting Wright v.\nTexas Southern University, 392 F.2d 728, 729 (5th Cir. 1968)).\nThird, while this Court has held that \"a person has a liberty\ninterest in pursuing an occupation\" (Phillips v. Vandygriff, 711\nF.2d 1217, 1222 (5th Cir. 1983)(citing cases)), the PPST requirement\ndoes not significantly deprive appellees of this interest. As the\ndistrict court found, students can retake the PPST an unlimited\nnumber of times. Accordingly, failure on the PPST does not\nabsolutely deprive appellees of the opportunity to teach in Texas;\n4/\nit merely means that they must take the test again.\n4/ Of course, some students may fail the test no matter how many\ntimes they take it. As to those students, however, notice is not\nan issue.\n\nThis Court's decision in Tyler v. Vickery, 517 F.2d 1089\n(1975), demonstrates the importance of this distinction. In that\ncase, this Court held that although \"[t]he safeguards of the due\nprocess clause are * * * available to a failing bar applicant,\" a\nstate is not required to give such an applicant a hearing. Id. at\n1103. In reaching this conclusion, this Court attached critical\nsignificance to the fact that the state gave those who failed the\nexam an unqualified right to retake it six months later. Id. at\n1103-1105. The Court specifically explained its decision as\nfollows (id. at 1104-1105):\n[F]ailure on a bar examination does not stigmatize\nan individual as 'incompetent,' but merely indicates\nthat he did not demonstrate minimal competence on a\nparticular examination. Upon reexamination, such an\nindividual is entitled to have his paper graded by\nthe same standards as those of everyone else, and if\nhe passes, to be admitted on precisely the same basis\nas an applicant who had not previously taken the exami-\nnation.\nFor these reasons, this Court concluded, \"the 'liberty interest'\na failing examinee has at stake [is] a minor, if not a non-existent\none.\" Id. at 1105.\nThis Court held in Mahavongsanan, 529 F.2d at 449, that a court\nmay review decisions concerning academic standards if they are \"shown\nto be clearly arbitrary or capricious.\" But as the Supreme Court\nindicated in Board of Curators of the University of Missouri v.\nHorowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 92 (1978), courts \"are particularly ill-\nequipped to evaluate [such decisions]\" and this consideration \"warn[s]\nagainst any such judicial intrusion into academic decisionmaking.\"\nHere, the district court never identified precisely why it would\n\n- 35 -\nbe arbitrary or capricious for a state to give college students\na 12th grade level test on basic skills without advance notice,\nparticularly since the state gives those students an unlimited\nopportunity to retake the test. After all, the purpose of this\ntest is to determine whether college students possess basic skills\nat the high school level.\nIn any event, the legislation passed in 1981 expressly\nprovided that students seeking admission into teacher education\nprograms would have to pass a test on \"basic skills\" (Texas Educa-\ntion Code, Section 13.032). In January 1982, the State Board\npublished a rule specifying that this requirement would take effect\non May 1, 1984 and sent copies of the rule to all colleges and\nuniversities (Veselka Dep. 18, 96). In the same year, the State\nBoard required all colleges and universities to include notice of\nthe testing requirement in their catalogues (Tr. 1163). Thus,\neven assuming the Due Process Clause required some kind of notice\nof the testing requirement, the State fulfilled this requirement.\nMoreover, in the spring of 1983, the State Board sent a\npamphlet to all college students notifying them of the testing\nrequirement (id. at 95-96; Deft. Ex. 10). That pamphlet explained\nthat the test would cover basic skills in reading, writing and\narithmetic, and gave descriptions of the content that would be\ncovered on each section (Deft. Ex. 10). It also informed students\nto contact their local institutions or the Texas Education Agency\nfor additional information about the test (ibid.).(cid:9) While we\ndo not believe these additional steps were required, they surely\nrefute any possible suggestion that the State failed to provide\nappellees with adequate notice.\n\n- 36 -\nThe district court apparently believed that the State\nshould have given students additional preparation materials, such as\nskill \nsample test questions and a more detailed list of the  areas\n5/\ncovered by the test.(cid:9) obviously, information of this kind would\nhave been helpful. But it would trivialize the Due Process Clause\nto hold that a state is constitutionally precluded from giving\ncollege students a 12th grade level test on basic skills in reading,\nwriting, and arithmetic unless it provides them with sample test\nquestions first.\nIn sum, appellees are unlikely to prevail on their claim\nthat the State's imposition of the PPST requirement violated their\nrights under the Due Process Clause. The district court's contrary\n6/\nholding is based on a misapplication of the governing legal standards.\n5/ The State did supply this kind of material upon request to some\nstudents and many institutions (Tr. 1171; Veselka Dep. 96-98, 100-102;\nDeft. Ex. 11). It did not systematically provide such information\nto all students and all institutions, however (Veselka Dep. 98).\n6/ Appellees also claim that the PPST violates Due Process because\nit tests material they have not been taught. Citing this Court's\ndecision in Debra P. V. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397, 404 (1981), the\ndistrict court held that if the PPST tests skills the State has\nnot taught, its use would violate Due Process (Mem. 38). The\ncourt found, however, that insufficient evidence had been presented\nto decide the likelihood of appellees' prevailing on this factual\nissue. The district court erred in extrapolating from Debra P. a\nuniversal rule that a test covering material not previously taught\nviolates Due Process. Debra P. dealt with a high school graduation\ntest. Nothing in Debra P. suggests that this principle applies\nto tests used for admission into professional schools and ultimately\ninto the profession itself. A state has a legitimate interest in\npreventing those who lack basic skills from becoming teachers.\nThat interest does not disappear simply because the reason particular\nindividuals lack basic skills is that they have not been taught\nthem. It may seem unfair to test students on material they have\nnot been taught. It is more unfair, however, to impose on young\nchildren teachers who lack basic skills. Because the district\ncourt premised its finding of a probable Due Process violation on\nlack of adequate notice and did not reach appellees' alternative\nDue Process claim, this Court need not decide this issue now.\n\n- 37 -\nC. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their Title VI claim\nThe district court held that appellees were also likely to\nprevail on their claim under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d), which prohibits discrimination in federally\nassisted programs. The district court premised this holding entirely\non its previous conclusion that appellees were likely to prevail\non their claim that the State's use of the PPST was motivated by\ndiscriminatory intent in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\nAs we have discussed, the district court's finding on intent\nis based on an improper legal standard and is clearly erroneous.\nSince the court's analysis under Title VI simply tracks its\nanalysis under the Equal Protection Clause, it suffers from precisely\n7/\nthe same errors.\n7/Appellees claim that the State's use of the PPST also violates\na Title VI regulation that prohibits a recipient of federal\nfinancial assistance from using \"criteria or methods of\nadministration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to\ndiscrimination * * *.\" 34 C.E.R. 100.3(b)(2). Because the district\ncourt refrained from addressing whether appellees were likely\nto prevail on this claim, that issue is not before this Court\non this appeal.\n\n- 38 -\nD. The district court erred in holding that appellees were\nlikely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Educational\nOpportunity Act\nThe district court held (Mem. 45-47) that there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that appellees will prevail on their\nclaim that the PPST violates the Equal Educational Opportunities\nAct of 1974 (EEOA). Specifically, the court relied upon the\nsection which provides that no State shall deny equal educational\nopportunity by its failure to \"take affirmative steps * * * to\nremove the vestiges of a dual school system\" (20 U.S.C. 1703(b)).\nTaking \"judicial notice of its own findings regarding the nature\nof the Texas school systems over the years * * *\" (Mem. 46), the\ncourt reasoned that many students now seeking to become teachers\nmust have received some years of their education in imperfectly-\ndesegregated schools. It follows, the court held, that the\ndisproportionate failure rate was, itself, a vestige of past\ndiscrimination. This analysis is fundamentally flawed for several\nreasons.\nFirst, the EEOA does not impose any obligations upon higher\neducation systems or authorities. It is limited in effect to\nthe activities of state and local educational agencies at the\nelementary and secondary levels. See 20 U.S.C. 1720(a) and\n(b); 20 U.S.C. 881(f) and (k). Accordingly, the EEOA imposes\nno obligations, remedial or otherwise on the higher education\nsystem in Texas. Acceptance of the District Court's holding\nwould constitute an unwarranted extension of the Debra P. rule\n\n- 39 -\nto govern admission to systems of higher education which receive\nsome or most of their students from non-unitary systems. Such\nan extension of Debra P. conflicts with basic principles of\nfederal remedial authority and Equal Protection analysis.\nHigher education systems, even in formerly de jure states,\nhave no constitutional or statutory obligation to suspend or\nlower perfectly valid academic standards to accommodate high\nschool students who may be ill-prepared because of prior con-\nstitutional violations by local and elementary school systems.\nAs previously noted, the Supreme Court cases delineating the\nfundamental limitations on federal remedial authority in\ndesegregation cases make clear that imposing such an obligation\non a higher education system would be impermissible because\nthe scope of such remedies necessarily exceeds the \"nature\nand extent of the violation,\" General Building Contractors\nAssn., supra, 458 U.S. at 399. Accord, Swann, supra, 402 U.S.\nat 22-23; Pasadena Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 436\n(1976); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 746-747 (1974)\n(Milliken I). The higher education entities in this case\ncannot be required to correct discrimination by other entities\nin Texas any more than the suburban school districts in Milliken\nI could be required to correct Detroit's segregative practices.\nTo conclude otherwise would mean that a state that once practiced\nschool segregation may not set minimum standards for any trade\nthat involves state licensing -- even those not related to\n\n- 40 -\neducation -- e.g., barbers and plumbers. All standard-setting,\nby this reckoning, superimposes penalties on the victims of\npast discrimination.\nMoreover, wholly apart from the question of whether\nfederal courts can require such \"remedial\" action, we submit\nthat a prohibition against otherwise valid academic standards\nin this context does not, in any meaningful way, counteract the\neffects of past segregation -- indeed such a rule will serve to\nperpetuate such effects. No one disputes the unfortunate fact\nthat past racial discrimination in public schools (and other\nareas) has adversely affected the educational achievement levels\nof minority students in formerly segregated (and other) schools.\nBut it clearly makes no sense, from a constitutional perspective,\nto \"solve\" that problem by enjoining or fundamentally altering\notherwise valuable academic programs that serve an essential\neducational function. It is difficult to conceive of what\n\"advantage\" is secured to the purported beneficiaries of a\ndoctrine which prohibits universities from applying to them the\nsame valid academic standards imposed on their colleagues. It\nis only a most otiose -- if not perverse -- notion of equality\nthat prevents such neutral inquiry into whether students possess\nthe basic school skills required of others in the professions\nthey seek to enter. Any educational deficiencies suffered by\nminority students in elementary and secondary schools are not\ncorrected by such a scheme, they are simply enshrined in\n\nmow\nperpetuity. In short, adoption of such a doctrine would be to\n\"celebrate and perpetuate the hollow certification that accom-\npanied black graduation pre-Brown [v. Board of Education, 347\nU.S. 483 (1954)].\" Debra P. V. Turlington, 654 F.2d 1079, 1085\n(5th Cir. 1981) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from denial of rehear-\ning en banc).\nBut even assuming the would-be teachers benefit from not\nbeing held to generally applicable academic requirements, such\na rule surely will have no such beneficial effect on their\nfuture students. The state is surely not required to impose on\nfuture generations the stunting effects of past discrimination.\nPermitting people to teach who themselves lack basic skills\nwould do exactly that. Moreover, far from supplying students\nwith genuine \"minority role models,\" disallowing an examination\nof whether minority teachers possess basic skills can only have\na stigmatizing effect on them and a deleterious effect on those\nwhom they teach. It is presumably for this reason that this\nCourt has permitted school districts that are in the process of\ndesegregating to utilize examinations among the objective and\nnonracial criteria for hiring, promotion, and demotion of\nteachers. 8/ Thus, the state's effort to upgrade its certified\n8/ See, e.g., Moore v. Tangipohoa Parish School Board, 594\nF.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1979); Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Educ.\n(Sumter County), 463 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1972). Of course,\nwhere the test is being used as one instrumentality of demons-\ntrable racially discriminatory purpose, the court did not\npermit it. See, e.g., Baker v. Columbus Municipal Separate\nSchool District, 462 F.2d 1112 (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n- 42 -\nteachers is a legitimate measure to correct the effects of all\nthose past practices that may have depressed the level of\nscholastic achievement in Texas.\nMoreover, there is an additional reason why application\nof the Debra P. rule is inappropriate here. State action can\nonly violate the EEOA if it directly affects some facet of\nelementary or secondary education. The student's \"expectation\"\nof a diploma may make the diploma an intrinsic perquisite or\nterm and condition of secondary education. But entrance to a\nprofessional school is not part of the normal expectation of\nall students who complete a high school curriculum. on the\ncontrary, one would think it assumed that not every high school\ngraduate is qualified to become a teacher. Nor is it part of\nthe implicit bargain between the state and its young people\nthat completion of high school will render all of them qualified\nto enter any particular trade or institution of higher learning.\nIn any event, Debra P. would be inapposite even if it\napplied. There is no evidence in the record of this case that\nwould support a finding that there has been widespread segre-\ngation in Texas' elementary and secondary schools in the past\ndecade. The first order in this case was entered in 1971, and\nthere is no basis for saying that there has been significant\nnoncompliance with that order.\n\n- 43 -\nFinally, the court failed to take account of the evidence\nshowing that the PPST is, in fact, serving a remedial purpose.\nThe record reflects that there is ample provision for remedial\neducation in the state's junior and community colleges. The\ndistrict court itself found, moreover, that the students who\nfailed the PPST have not given up, and have worked to improve\ntheir skills so that the proportion of those passing has greatly\nincreased in the last year (Mem. 21, n. 15; Tr. 1516).\nCONCLUSION\nThe district court's decision should be reversed and the\ncase should be remanded with directions to dismiss appellees'\nmotion for lack of jurisdiction. In the alternative, the\ndistrict court's decision should be reversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM ._J AD rs DLaZ(cid:9) DS\nAssistant Attorney General\nBRIAN K.

Whether the district court lacked jurisdiction?\n2. Whether the district court erred in holding that\nappellees were likely to prevail on their claims under the Equal\nProtection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act\nof 1974.\n\n- 2 -\nSTATEMENT\nA. Backaround\nIn 1981, the Texas Legislature enacted a law that requires\nstudents to pass a test on basic skills as a condition of admission\ninto a State approved teacher education program (Texas Education\nCode, Section 13.032). In January 1982, the State Board of Education\nadopted a rule specifying that this requirement would take effect\n1/\non May 1, 1984 (Veselka Dep. 18). In the summer of 1982, the\nState Board decided that the basic skills tested should include\nreading, writing, and arithmetic and that the Pre-Professional Skills\nTest (PPST) should be used to measure these skills provided that\nit could be validated for this purpose (id. at 19-20).\nIn October 1982, the State Board contracted with IOX Associates\nto perform such a validation study (id. at 23). One year later,\nIOX issued its final report concluding that the PPST was valid\n(id. at 24). In February 1984, the State Board formally approved\nthe use of the PPST and established the scores that would be necessary\nto pass the test (id. at 24-25). In March 1984, the test was\ngiven for the first time (id. at 25).\nUnder the Board's regulations, the test is given three times\nevery year, and students are permitted to take the test as many\ntimes as they wish (id. at 27, 29). If a student fails any one of\nl/ \"Dep.\" refers to Deposition; \"Mem.\" refers to the district court's\nMemorandum Opinion; \"Tr.\" refers to Transcript; \"Ex.\" refers to\nExhibit.\n\n-3-\nthe sections of the test, however, he can take no more than six\ncredits of education courses until he passes the test (id. at 79).\nStudents generally begin taking education courses in their junior\nyear.\nThe PPST is designed to test basic skills at the 12th grade\nlevel (Tr. 1182-1183). During the first year of its use, 73% of\nthe whites, 34% of the Hispanics, and 23% of the blacks who took\nthe test passed it (Pltfs,Ex. 10).\nB. Proceedings in the district court\nIn July 1985, appellees (LULAC, GI Forum, NAACP, and a\nnumber of Hispanic and black college students) filed a motion to\nenforce the statewide desegregation decree in United States v.\nState of Texas, 447 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1971) (Motion to Enforce\nDecree filed on July 19, 1985). That case began in 1971 as a suit\nto desegregate nine all-black school districts. The case was then\nexpanded and resulted in a decree requiring the State to assume\nresponsibility for the desegregation of public schools throughout\nTexas.\nIn their motion, appellees alleged that the State's use of\nthe PPST violated provisions in the decree that required the State\nto provide Hispanic and black students in the public schools with\naccess to minority teachers (id. at 1-2). In addition, appellees\nalleged that the use of the test violated the rights of students\nseeking admission into teacher education programs under the Equal\nProtection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil\n\n-4-\nRights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d), the Equal Educational Oppor-\ntunities Act (20 U.S.C. 1703), and the contract between the United\nStates and the State of Texas guaranteeing equal education oppor-\ntunity in higher education (id. at 2-3).\nAppellees immediately moved for a preliminary injunction\npreventing the State from using the test as a barrier to admission\nto teacher education programs. After a hearing, the district\ncourt granted this motion (Memorandum Opinion filed on August 27,\n1985).\nC. The district court's decision\n1. Jurisdiction\nThe court first determined that its authority to enforce\nthe decree in United States v. State of Texas gave it jurisdiction\nto resolve appellees' motion. The court acknowledged that its\nprevious orders \"did not deal specifically with the adoption of\nthe PPST\" (Mem. 14). The court concluded, however, that the\nState's use of the PPST could frustrate the purpose of that decree.\nAccording to the court, the purpose of the decree was to enforce\nthe State's obligation to create a unitary system and this obligation\nincludes a duty to provide minority children with \"minority role\nmodels\" (id. at 14-16). Since the court found \"[a]mple evidence\"\nthat the use of the PPST would \"greatly diminish[]\" the number of\nminority teachers, the court was convinced that it had jurisdiction\nto consider the merits of appellees' attack on it (id. at 16-17).\n\n-5--\nThe court also concluded that the PPST issue fell within\nthe confines of its previous order requiring local school districts\nto use \"non-racial, non-ethnic criteria in hiring\" (id. at 17).\nThe court pointed out that if a local school district had adopted\nthe PPST as a prerequisite to hiring, the court clearly would\nhave had jurisdiction to consider whether the local district\nhad violated this provision (id. at 18-19). The court reasoned\nit should make no difference for purposes of jurisdiction that\nthe PPST requirement is State rather than locally imposed (id. at 19).\nBased on this analysis, the court not only assumed jurisdic-\ntion over appellees' claim that the State had violated the terms\nof the decree, it also assumed jurisdiction over appellees' claims\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI,\nand the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (id. at 19). The court\nrefused to consider appellees' claim that the State had violated\nits agreement to provide equal education opportunity in higher\neducation, however (id. at 19). The court explained that \"[t]he\nprogress of the State of Texas in ensuring equal educational oppor-\ntunity in colleges and universities is, jurisdictionally speaking,\nnot a concern of this court\" (id. at 20).\n2. The merits of the motion\nIn deciding to grant a preliminary injunction against use\nof the PPST, the court considered four factors: (1) the harm to\nappellees in denying an injunction; (2) the harm to the State in\n\n-6-\ngranting an injunction; (3) the public interest; and (4) the proba-\nbility that appellees would prevail on the merits (id. at 20 citing\nCamenisch v. University of Texas, 616 F.2d 127, 130 (5th Cir.\n1980)).\n'The court first found that unless an injunction were issued,\nmany students would have to postpone completion of their education\ncourses for at least six months to one year (id. at 21). This, in\nturn, would deprive students in public schools of minority teachers\n\"at a time when the state is experiencing a significant teacher\nshortage\" (ibid.). For this reason, the court concluded, appellees\nhad established irreparable harm (id. at 22).\nOn the other hand, the court found that the State would not\nsuffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction were granted.\nThe State argued that an injunction would permit students without\nthe necessary skills to take courses, would negatively affect public\nperception, and would be unfair to students who take courses only to\nfind out later that they must still pass the PPST (id. at 22). In\nthe court's view, \"none of these 'harms' [was] persuasive\" (id. at\n23). The court found that students who failed the PPST would be\nable to learn the material in their courses, that negative\npublic perception was irrelevant, and that students could make an\ninformed choice on whether to take education courses knowing that\nthey still might have to pass the PPST (id. at 23-24).\n\n-7-\nThe court concluded that the public interest also weighed\nin favor of granting an injunction. The court explained that\nsince its injunction would only permit students to enroll in courses\nand would not permit them to become certified, the public's interest\nin competent teachers was not implicated (id. at 24-25). In contrast,\nthe court found that the public's interest in alleviating the\nteacher shortage would be served by granting an injunction (id. at\n25).\nThe court finally determined that appellees were likely\nto prevail on the merits. The court recognized that to prevail on\ntheir Equal Protection claim, appellees were required to show that\nthe State had adopted the PPST with a racially discriminatory\npurpose (id. at 26). in the court's view, however, \"the most\nreliable way to determine discriminatory intent in a school desegre-\ngation case is to look at the reasonably foreseeable results of the\nactions being challenged\" (id. at 32). The court therefore viewed\nthe State's awareness that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact on black and Hispanic students as proof of discriminatory\nintent (id. at 27, 32).\nThe court also relied on several other factors as evidence\nof discriminatory intent. The court found that \"the historical\nbackground of [the] decision [was] one of repeated and recent instances\nof intentional segregation, particularly in areas of South Texas\nwhere there is a substantial Mexican-American population\" (id. at\n27). The court also found it significant that the State had failed\n\n-8-\nto attempt \"to discover whether the test itself was the source of\nthe impact or whether alternative tests existed\" (ibid.). The\ncourt was especially critical of the State's failure to \"organize\nany sort of remediation program specifically directed at preparing\nminority students for the PPST\" (id. at 27-28). In the court's\nview, \"[t]he state's passivity seem[ed] particularly callous in the\nface of the almost heroic efforts made by colleges and universities\nwith heavy minority concentrations hastily to devise makeshift\nremediation programs of their own\" (id. at 31-32).\nIn addition, the court found it \"[p]articularly disturbing\"\nthat the State had instituted an alternative certification procedure\nin response to teacher shortages resulting from the PPST (id. at\n29). Under this procedure, those graduating from college and\npassing the PPST will be allowed to teach without any courses in\nteacher education. According to the court, \"[t]he choice to sacri-\nfice the requirement of two years of training specifically directed\nat being a teacher, * * * rather than change the PPST preclusionary\nscores or petition the Legislature to allow waiver of the PPST\nrequirement, was one of the strongest indications of racial intent\npresented at the hearing\" (id. at 29).\nAs the court viewed the testimony of the State's witnesses,\nthe State's conduct seemed to have \"sprung from an attitude that\nminority students were themselves to blame for their poor performance\"\n(id. at 30-31). That attitude, the court found, was evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent (id. at 31). Finally, the court found it\n\n-9-\n\"extremely significant\" that the State Board was composed of 27\nmembers, with only one black and three Hispanic members (id. at\n32-33). As the court saw it, \"[t]his factor adds weight to [appel-\nlees'] claims of intentional discrimination, for these minority\nmembers could get no more response to their concerns about minority\nimpact than the appointment of an apparently powerless committee\nwhich met once and dissolved\" (id. at 33). The court concluded\nthat the evidence \"strongly suggests\" that the State acted with\ndiscriminatory intent in adopting the PPST and that appellees were\ntherefore likely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Protection\nClause (id. at 34).\nThe court also held that appellees were likely to prevail\non their Due Process claim. The court understood that to\nestablish a violation of the Due Process Clause, appellees were\nrequired to establish a protected liberty or property interest\n(id. at 34). The court found it unlikely that appellees would be\nable to establish a protected property interest (ibid.). The\ncourt held that since colleges and universities have always had a\nlarge measure of discretion to determine their own admission and\ncertification standards, the State had not created any property\ninterest in becoming certified as a teacher (id. at 35). The court\nconcluded, however, that the students did have a constitutionally\nprotected liberty interest \"in being able to pursue the occupation\nof their choice\" and that this interest was implicated since the\n\"[f]ailure to pass the PPST unequivocally deprives a student of\nthe opportunity to teach in Texas\" (id. at 35-36).\n\n- 10 -\nThe court held that although the scope of this Due Process\nright was unclear, it necessarily included a right to \"reasonable\nnotice of the state's requirement\" (id. at 36). The court found\nthat \"the students and teacher education programs were given very\nlittle notice of the PPST requirement and the proposed preclusionary\nscores,\" and \"no materials to help prepare for the PPST beyond a\npamphlet\" (id. at 37). For this reason, the court concluded that\nappellees were \"likely to prove that the [State] deprived them of\ntheir right to teach in Texas, without sufficient notice concerning\nthe nature and imminence of the PPST\" (id. at 38).\nThe court held that the Due Process Clause also required the\nState to show that \"students in Texas had been taught the materials\ncovered in the PPST\" (ibid. citing Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d\n397, 404 (5th Cir. 1981)). After reviewing the State's effort to\nmake this showing, as well as appellees' criticisms of that attempt,\nthe court concluded that \"insufficient evidence ha[d] been presented\non which to decide the likelihood of [appellees'] success on [this\nissue]\" (id. at 38-41).\nThe court next considered appellees' claim that the use of\nthe PPST violated the prohibition in Title VI against discrimina-\ntion in federally assisted programs. The court held that since\nthe teacher education programs receive federal financial assistance\nand Title VI affords individuals a private right of action, appellees\ncould attack the PPST under Title VI (id. at 41-45). After noting\n\n- 11 -\nthat appellees had shown a likelihood of success on their constitu-\ntional claim, the court held that \"this likelihood extends to their\ncause of action under [Title VI]\" (id. at 45).\nFinally, the court considered appellees' claim that the\nState had failed \"to take affirmative steps * * * to remove the\nvestiges of a dual school system\" as required by the Equal Educa-\ntional Opportunities Act (ibid.). As the court understood this provi-\nsion, the State could not use the PPST to prevent students who\nstill suffered the effects of the dual system from entering teacher\neducation programs (id. at 46-47). The court found that the limited\nevidence introduced at the hearing on this issue indicated that\nthe test was being applied to such students (id. at 47). The\ncourt therefore concluded that appellees had shown \"a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits of this claim\" (id. at 46-47).\nBased on its findings under the four factors (harm to\nappellees, harm to the State, the public interest, and likelihood\nof success), the district court issued a preliminary injunction\nrequiring the State to \"permit colleges and universities in the\nState of Texas to admit those students, regardless of race, to\ncourses in their Education Departments who would have been qualified\nto enroll in those courses but for their failing the [PPST]\"\n(Preliminary Injunction filed on August 27, 1985). From this\norder, the State of Texas and the United States have appealed.\n\n- 12 -\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nAppellees have challenged the State's authority to use a\nbasic skills test (the PPST) as a condition of admission into\nteacher education programs. After a hearing, the district court\ngranted appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction against\nfurther use of the test. We believe the district court erred in\ntwo important ways.\n1. Most fundamentally, the district court lacked jurisdiction\nover appellees' challenge. Appellees asserted jurisdiction under\nthe statewide desegregation decree in United States v. State of\nTexas, and the district court assumed jurisdiction entirely on that\nbasis. The State of Texas decree only requires the State to take\nresponsibility for the desegregation of elementary and secondary\nschools, however. It does not limit the State's authority in the\nfield of higher education. Since the PPST is used in colleges and\nuniversities and not in the elementary and secondary schools, the\nState of Texas decree did not give the district court jurisdiction\nto review appellees' challenge to it.\nThe district court held that minority students in the\nelementary and secondary schools have a constitutional right to\nminority teachers and that the PPST indirectly affects that right.\nBut this Court has repeatedly held that minority students have no\nsuch right. And while it is true that the PPST may ultimately\naffect the number of minority teachers, that is not a basis for\nexercising jurisdiction over a claim of discrimination in college\nadmissions. School desegregation remedies are necessarily limited\n\n- 13 -\nto eliminating discrimination that actually occurs in the public\nschools. They cannot embrace State action that occurs elsewhere\nsimply because it may indirectly affect the students in those\nschools.\n2. The district court also erred in holding that appellees\nwere likely to \nprevail on the merits. To establish a violation of\nEqual Protection, appellees were required to prove that the State's\nuse of the PPST was motivated by racially discriminatory intent.\nWhile the district court purported to follow this principle, it\nheld that the most reliable way to determine intent was to examine\nthe reasonably foreseeable results of the State's action. That\nstandard is inconsistent with controlling Supreme Court decisions\nwhich hold that it is improper to equate intent with foreseeability.\nThe available evidence does not permit an inference of\ndiscriminatory intent. The State legislation requiring competency\ntesting of basic skills was designed to improve teacher quality,\nnot to diminish the number of minority teachers. And the State\nBoard's adoption and implementation of the PPST was motivated by an\nintent to faithfully carry out the legislative mandate. Indeed,\nthe State Board did not finally approve the use of the PPST until\nit received a report that the test was a valid measure of the\nskills needed for success in teacher training and for success as a\nteacher. The evidence cited by the district court merely shows\nthat the State knew that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact and that it decided to use it anyway. That is not a\nsufficient basis for an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n- 14 -\nThe court's holding that appellees were likely to show\nthat the State deprived them of their liberty interest in pursuing\nthe occupation of their choice without adequate notice is also in\nerror. This Court has held that general standards of uniform\napplication do not ordinarily trigger any requirement of individual\nnotice and opportunity to be heard. Moreover, this Court has held\nthat procedural Due Process, although applicable to university\ndecisions concerning student misconduct, is not fully applicable\nto academic decisions. Finally, this Court has held that while\nthere is a liberty interest in pursuing an occupation, that interest\nis not significantly implicated when there is an opportunity to\nretake the test. Although requirements that are wholly arbitrary\nor capricious violate Due Process, the district court failed to\narticulate why it would be arbitrary or capricious to give college\nstudents a test on 12th grade level basic skills without prior\nnotice. In any event, the legislation itself, the Board's\nregulations implementing the statute, and the colleges' catalogues\nall gave notice of the testing requirement long before the test\nwas first given.\nThe district court also erred in holding that appellees were\nlikely to prevail on their Title VI claim. The court's Title VI\nholding is based entirely on its prior finding of a probable Equal\nProtection violation. Since the court's Title VI analysis tracks\nits Equal Protection analysis, it suffers from the same errors.\n\n- 15 -\nFinally, \nthe district court erred in holding that appellees\nwere likely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Educational\nOpportunities Act (\"EEOA\"). The EEOA's remedial obligations extend\nonly to elementary and secondary schools. While 20 U.S.C. 1703(b),\non which the court relied, requires the dismantling of dual systems\n\"root and branch,\" it imposes no duty upon higher educational auth-\norities to compensate students for the academic deficiencies which\nmay be vestiges of past segregation in the first twelve grades.\nIndeed, colleges and universities are not required, either by the\nConstitution or by the EEOA, to lower their entrance standards to\naccommodate those students whose failure to meet minimum standards\nmay be, in part, a consequence of past discrimination in elementary\nor secondary education.\nThe court's reliance on Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d\nCir. \n397 (5th  1981), is misplaced. In that case, this Court held\nthat students who complete a high school course to the satisfaction\nof their own schools are normally entitled to expect to receive a\ndiploma. For this reason, this Court concluded, the state that\npracticed segregation during the school-life of these students\nshould not permit the consequences of that segregation to stand\nbetween the students and their diplomas. But this has no bearing\non the present case.\nEntrance into a professional school is not part of the\nnormal expectations of all students who complete high school.\nMoreover, if the district court's logic were accepted, it -would\nmean that any state that practiced segregation in the past could\nnot set minimum standards for entry into any profession. All such\nstandards could be said to penalize the victims of prior segregation.\n\n- 16 -\nThe application of Debra P. to professional standards for teachers\nis particularly inappropriate. Here what arguably may be fair\nto would-be teachers is unfair to those who will be taught. If\nthe state is required to accept into the teaching profession those\nwho cannot satisfy minimum standards, it will not remedy but perpet-\nuate the effects of past discrimination (if any) by allowing academic\ndeficiency to be passed from one generation to the next.\nIn any event, there is no evidence from which a court could\nconclude that there has been widespread school segregation in\nTexas upon which current academic deficiencies could be blamed.\nAnd even if there were, Debra P. held that a test having disparate\nimpact traceable to past discrimination can be justified if it\nhas a remedial function. Where students are spurred by the test\nto upgrade their skills, the test vindicates its usefulness. That\nis ultimately what happened in Debra P.; there is ample evidence\nthat the same is true in the present case.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT LACKED JURISDICTION\nTO CONSIDER APPELLEES' CHALLENGE TO THE\nSTATE'S USE OF THE PPST\nAppellees have challenged the State's use of the PPST\nas a condition of admission into teacher education programs.\nAppellees did not file a complaint attacking the State's require-\nment, however. Instead, they filed a motion to enforce the state-\nwide desegregation decree in United States v. State of Texas. The\ndistrict court concluded that appellees' motion fell within its\n\n- 17 -\nauthority to enforce that decree and assumed jurisdiction over\nappellees' claims entirely on that basis. As we argued below,\nappellees' challenge to the State's use of the PPST does not impli-\ncate the decree in United States v. State of Texas. The district\ncourt should therefore have dismissed appellees' motion for lack\nof jurisdiction.\nAs this Court recently explained, United States v. State\nof Texas began as a suit to desegregate nine all-black school\ndistricts (680 F.2d 356, 358 (1982)). The case was then expanded\nand resulted in a decree directing the State to assume responsibility\nfor the desegregation of public schools throughout Texas (ibid.).\nWhile this decree is undeniably broad, it is limited to curing the\nviolation identified in that case -- racial segregation in the\nelementary and secondary schools throughout the State. United\nStates v. State of Texas did not involve allegations of discrimina-\ntion against black and Hispanic students in colleges and universities,\nand the decree therefore does not purport to circumscribe the State's\nauthority in that area. Nor could it. Under well established\nprinciples, judicial remedial authority can \"extend no farther\nthan required by the nature and extent of th[e] violation.\" General\nBuilding Contractors Assn. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 399\n(1982). Since the violation identified in United States v. State\nof Texas concerned the elementary and secondary schools, the\nremedy was required to be similarly limited.\n\n- 18 -\nThe district court's assumption of jurisdiction is inconsis-\ntent with this understanding of the United States v. State of\nTexas decree. Appellees' challenge to the State's use of the PPST\nthreatens the State's authority over colleges and universities,\nnot its authority over the public schools. The PPST is used as a\ncondition of admission into college and university education programs;\nit is not used in the State's elementary and secondary schools.\nIf the State's use of the PPST violates anyone's rights, it is the\nrights of college students seeking admission into teacher education\nprograms, not those of students attending elementary and secondary\nschools. In these circumstances, the district court had no basis\nfor asserting jurisdiction under the United States v. State of\nTexas decree.\nIn reaching a contrary conclusion, the district court\nheld that the State's use of the PPST might undermine one of the\npurposes of its decree. According to the court, one purpose of\nits decree was to enforce the State's constitutional obligation to\nprovide minority children with \"minority role models\" (Mem. 14-16).\nSince the court found that the PPST would have the effect of\ndiminishing the number of minority teachers, it felt compelled to\nconsider appellees' attack on it.\nThis reasoning is fundamentally flawed. To be sure, this\nCourt has held that discrimination in the assignment and hiring of\nteachers violates the constitutional rights of students, and\nhas insisted that desegregation remedies include a prohibition\nagainst that kind of discrimination. See Singleton v. Jackson\n\n- 19 -\nMunicipal Separate School District, 419 F.2d 1211, 1218 (1970).\nBut this Court has repeatedly held that students do not have a\nconstitutional right to minority teachers per se. Fort Bend Indepen-\ndent School District v. Stafford, 651 F.2d 1133, 1139-1140 (1981)\n(citing cases). And it has never come close to suggesting that\nstudents in the public schools have a constitutional right to have\ncollege students admitted into teacher education programs on a\nnondiscriminatory basis. To take that leap now would stretch\nthe principle involved in Singleton beyond recognition.\nIt is true that if minority students are excluded from\nteacher education programs in disproportionate numbers, it may\nreduce the number of minority teachers in the public schools and\nthis, in turn, may affect the minority students attending those\nschools. But that is not a proper basis for exercising jurisdiction\nover appellees' claims. The remedy in a school desegregation case\nmust be designed to eliminate racial discrimination that actually\noccurs in the public schools. Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\n433 U.S. 406, 419-420 (1977) (Dayton I). School desegregation cases\nare not general forums for reviewing all claims of racial discrimi-\nnation that can be said to have some effect on students attending\nthose schools.\nIndeed, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1, 22 (1971), the Supreme Court expressly rejected that\nkind of expansive notion of the role of a federal court in a school\n\n- 20 -\ndesegregation case. The Court explained that (id. at 22):\nWe are concerned in these cases with the elimina-\ntion of the discrimination inherent in the dual\nschool systems, not with myriad factors of human\nexistence which can cause discrimination in a\nmultitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic\ngrounds. The target of the cases from Brown I\nto the present was the dual school system. \nThe\nelimination of racial discrimination in public\nschools is a large task and one that should not\nbe retarded by efforts to achieve broader purposes\n* * *• One vehicle can carry only a limited amount\nof baggage. It would not serve the important\nobjective of Brown I to seek to use school dese-\ngregation cases for purposes beyond their scope.\nThe Court went on to stress that the objective in a school\ndesegregation case \"is to see that school authorities exclude no\npupil of a racial minority from any school, directly or indirectly,\non account of race; it does not and cannot embrace all the problems\nof racial prejudice, even when those problems contribute to\ndisproportionate racial concentrations in some schools. Id. at 23\n(emphasis added).\nThe principles established in Swann are controlling here.\nAt its core, appellees' complaint is that the State's use of the\nPPST violates the rights of college students seeking admission\ninto teacher education programs. The State's policy will admittedly\nhave an indirect effect on minority students attending public\nschools. But this fact alone cannot transform a higher education\ncase into a public school desegregation case.\nAt one point, the district court recognized that it had no\nauthority over the State's activities in the field of higher\neducation. In refusing to exercise jurisdiction over appellees'\n\n- 21 -\nclaim that the State's use of the PPST violated its agreement to\nprovide equal education opportunity in higher education, the court\nexplained that \"[t]he progress of the State of Texas in ensuring\nequal educational opportunity in colleges and universities is,\njurisdictionally speaking, not a concern of this court\" (Mem. 20).\nThis statement is exactly right. Rather than simply leading the\ncourt to refuse jurisdiction over appellees' claim that the State\nhad breached its higher education agreement, however, it should\nhave led the court to decline jurisdiction over all of appellees'\nclaims.\nThis Court has recently noted that under the authority of\nthe United States v State of Texas decree, the district court\nhas engaged in a \"general undertaking to supervise broad aspects\nof Texas' educational system and policy.\" United States v. •State\nof Texas, supra, 680 F.2d at 358. While this Court approved\nthe court's authority to continue to enforce outstanding orders,\nit cautioned the district court to avoid extending its authority\ninto new areas that do not come within the specific terms of the\ndecree. Id. at 374. the district court failed to heed this caution.\nIn sum, the district court's authority to enforce its decree\nin United States v. State of Texas did not give it jurisdiction\nto decide the merits of appellees' attack on the State's use of\nthe PPST. This Court should therefore vacate the district court's\npreliminary injunction and remand with directions to dismiss\n\n- 22 -\n2/\nappellees' motion to enforce the decree.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT\nAPPELLEES WERE LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE\nMERITS\nEven assuming the district court had jurisdiction, it should\nnot have granted appellees' motion for preliminary relief. To\nprevail on their motion, appellees were required to show: (1) a\nsubstantial likelihood that they would prevail on the merits; (2)\nthat they would suffer irreparable injury; (3) that this injury\noutweighed any harm to the State; and (4) that a preliminary\ninjunction would serve the public interest. Canal Authority of the\nState of Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir. 1974).\nWhether or not appellees carried their burden on the other factors,\nthey most assuredly did not establish a likelihood of success on\nthe merits. While the district court held that appellees had\nshown probable violations of the Equal Protection Clause, the Due\nProcess Clause, Title VI, and the Equal Educational Opportunities\nAct, those holdings are in error.\n2/ As an alternative ground for assuming jurisdiction, the district\ncourt held that the PPST issue fell within its order requiring\nnon-racial, non-ethnic criteria to be used in hiring (Mem. 17).\nThis conclusion is incorrect. The order referred to by the court\nsimply directs the State to \"require each county or local educational\nagency [applying for State funds] to include * * * a list of objec-\ntive, non-racial, and non-ethnic criteria * * * by which it will\njudge prospective employees for faculty and staff positions.\"\nState of Texas, supra, 447 F.2d at 446. The order thus concerns\nthe kind of criteria local districts must use in making hiring\ndecisions. It has nothing to do with the kind of criteria the\nState must use in formulating college admission standards.\n\n- 23 -\nA. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their claim under the Eaual Protection Clause\nIn the first year of its administration, 73% of the whites,\n34% of the Hispanics, and 23% of the blacks who took the PPST passed\nit. These statistics lie at the heart of appellees' claim that the\n3/\nState's use of PPST violates the Equal Protection Clause.\nOf course, it is now well established that a law or other\nofficial act will not be held unconstitutional solely because it has\na racially disproportionate impact. Personnel Administrator v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426\nU.S. 229, 239 (1976). A violation of equal protection can be found\nonly if the impact \"can be traced to a racially discriminatory\npurpose.\" Feeney, supra, 442 U.S. at 272. In Davis, the Supreme\nCourt upheld a police department's employment test, even though it\nscreened out four times as many blacks as whites. In Arlington\nHeights, the Court upheld a municipality's zoning decision even\nthough it tended to perpetuate racially segregated housing patterns.\nAnd in Feeney, a case involving an allegation of sex rather than race\ndiscrimination, the Court upheld a state's veterans preference\neven though it made all but 2% of the women in the state ineligible\nfor state civil service jobs.\n3(cid:9) During the past year, there has been significant improvement in\nblack and Hispanic pass rates (Tr. 827, 1516). This trend can be\nexpected to continue. Indeed, one educator from a predominantly\nminority institution predicted that 70% of this year's freshmen would\neventually pass the test (Tr. 828). Thus, while the PPST may\ncontinue to have a disparate effect for some time, the statistics\ncited above considerably overstate the likely magnitude of that\neffect.\n\n- 24 -\nThe district court purported to follow the principle\ninvolved in these cases. Thus, the district court stated that\n\"[in order to prevail on their claim that the imposition of the\nPPST and the determination of preclusionary scores violated the\nEqual \nProtection clause [appellees] must show that [the State]\nacted with discriminatory intent or purpose\" (Mem. 26).(cid:9) The\ndistrict court went on to hold, however, \"that the most reliable\nway to determine discriminatory intent in a school desegregation\ncase is to look at the reasonably foreseeable results of the actions\nbeing challenged\" (id. at 32).\nThis holding is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision\nin Feeney . In that case, the lower court, relying on the same fore-\nseeability standard applied by the district court here, found that\nthe state's veterans preference reflected intentional discrimination\nagainst women. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the lower\ncourt had applied the wrong legal standard. The Court explained\nthat discriminatory purpose \"implies more than intent as volition\nor intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the\ndecisionmaker * * •} selected or reaffirmed a particular course of\naction at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,'\nits adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" 442 U.S. at 279.\nIn adopting a foreseeability standard for determining\ndiscriminatory intent, the district court relied on this Court's\ndecision in United States v. Texas Education Agency, 579 F.2d 910\n913-914 (1978). That decision, however, came before the Supreme\nCourt's decision in Feeney. To the extent that language in that\n\n- 25 -\nopinion suggests that it would be appropriate to equate intent\nwith foreseeability, it is inconsistent with Feeney and should not\nbe followed.\nAppellees appear to suggest that Feeney does not apply to\nrace discrimination cases (Response to Stay Motion 11). But in\nFeeney itself, the Court made clear that the same standard of\nintent governs both sex and race discrimination cases.\n442 U.S. at 273-274. And the Court has since applied the Feeney\ntest of intent in a race discrimination case. Washington v.\nSeattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 471 (1982).\nThe decisions in Columbus Board of Education v. Penick,\n443 U.S. 449 (1979) and Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\n443 U.S. 526 (1979)(Dayton II), cited by appellees, are not con-\ntrary. Indeed, in Dayton II, the Court expressly rejected the\nSixth Circuit's holding that a presumption of segregative purpose\narises from proof that actions have had a foreseeably segregative\neffect. 443 U.S. at 536 n.9. The Court explained that (ibid.):\n(w)e have never held that as a general proposition\nthe foreseeability of segregative consequences\nmakes out a prima facie case of purposeful racial\ndiscrimination and shifts the burden of producing\nevidence to the defendants if they are to escape\njudgment; and even more clearly there is no warrant\nin our cases for holding that such foreseeability\nroutinely shifts the burden of persuasion to the\ndefendants.\nOf course, as the Supreme Court has made clear, foresee-\nability of disparate impact is one kind of relevant evidence on the\nissue of discriminatory purpose. Dayton II, 443 U.S. at 536 n.9;\n\n- 26 -\nColumbus, 443 U.S. at 464-465. But that is far different from\nsaying, as the district court did, that foreseeability is tantamount\nto, or is the most reliable way to determine, discriminatory intent.\nThus, to establish a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause, appellees were required to show that the State adopted\nand implemented the PPST \"because of\" rather than merely \"in spite\nof\" its effect on black and Hispanic students seeking admission\ninto teacher education programs. The fact that the State knew\nfrom its pilot testing that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact on black and Hispanic students, while relevant on this\nissue, is far from proof of such a purpose.\nThe district court never found that appellees were likely to\nshow that the State's use of the PPST reflected intentional discrimina-\ntion in the sense demanded by Feeney. Nor is such a finding possible.\nThe State Board's adoption of the PPST was a direct response\nto legislation requiring that students pass a test on basic skills\nas a condition of admission into teacher education programs. The\nlegislature acted against the background of reports that the quality\nof students entering the teaching profession had been declining\nover time and that many now lacked the basic skills necessary to\nperform satisfactorily as teachers (Kirby Dep.'8-9). By requiring\ncompetency testing, the legislature sought to reverse this trend\nand to insure that the State's future teachers would have the\nnecessary basic skills (ibid.). The legislature's rationale for\nrequiring students to pass the test before entering teacher education\n\n- 27 -\nprograms was that students not only need basic skills to become\nsuccessful teachers, they also need them to profit from teacher\neducation courses (id. at 18-19). The legitimacy of these legisla-\ntive judgments is beyond dispute.\nAppellees have never suggested otherwise. Instead, appellees\nclaim that while the legislature's decision to impose competency\ntesting may have been motivated by a legitimate desire to improve\nteacher quality, the State Board's adoption and implementation\nof the PPST was motivated by an intent to diminish the number of\nminority teachers. The record does not support this claim.\nThe undisputed evidence shows that the State Board responded\nto the legislature's mandate as follows: The Board first determined\nthat the basic skills tested should include reading, writing and\narithmetic (Veselka Dep. 19). After considering a number of possible\ntests to measure these skills (id. at 19-20), the Board tentatively\nselected the PPST because it was the only test on the market speci-\nfically designed to test these skills at the level needed for\nentry into teacher education programs (id. at 60-61). Thereafter,\nthe Board hired IOX Associates to determine whether the PPST was\nvalid for its intended purpose (id. at 23). After IOX Associates\nissued a detailed report concluding that the PPST did measure\nskills needed for successful training and job performance, the\nBoard formally approved its use (id. at 24-25; Pltfs. Ex. 1, pp.\n24-27). At the same time, the Board adopted passing scores of\n51% for the math section, 55% for the reading section, and 58%\n\n- 28 -\nfor the writing section (Pltfs. Ex. 4;). Finally, the Board estab-\nlished a rule that students could take the test an unlimited number\nof times (Veselka Dep. 28-29). Nothing in this sequence of events\nremotely suggests that the Board's actions were governed by a\ndesire to prevent blacks \nand Hispanics from becoming teachers.\nThe district court found that the historical background of\nthe decision was one of \"repeated and recent instances of intentional\nsegregation, particularly in areas of South Texas where there is a\nsubstantial Mexican-American population\" (Mein. 27). The court did\nnot cite any evidence, however, to support this finding. The court\ndid cite two of this Court's decisions as support for its conclusion:\nUnited States v. Texas Education Agency, 679 F.2d 1104 (5th Cir.\n1982) (Port Arthur) and United States v. Texas Education Agency\n647 F.2d 504 (5th Cir. 1981) (South Park). But these cases involved\nallegations that local school districts had failed to fully desegre-\ngate their black students: Neither of these cases involved allega-\ntions of purposeful segregation against Mexican-Americans and\nneither case implicated the State in any way. The district court's\nfinding on this point is therefore clearly erroneous.\nThe district court also found that the Board's failure to\nconsider alternative tests after it learned that the PPST would\nhave a disproportionate impact was evidence of discriminatory intent.\nBut the proper inquiry is whether the test selected by the Board\nwas prompted by a legitimate purpose. Having selected a test\nthat was designed to measure the skills it thought necessary,\n\n- 29 -\nand having received a report that the test in fact measured those\nskills, the Board had no obligation to search for a test that\nwould maximize the minority pass rate. See Furnco Const.\nCorp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577-578 (1978).\t Moreover, the\nBoard had already considered a wide range of alternative tests\nbefore adopting the PPST and had rejected them because they were\nnot designed to measure the skills needed for entry into teacher\neducation programs (Veselka Dep. 60-61). In any event, appellees\nintroduced no evidence that there was another test in existence\nthat could measure the skills the Board thought necessary without\nproducing a similar disproportionate effect. See Albemarle Paper\nCo. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975). Thus, the Board's decision\nto proceed with the PPST, rather than considering other tests,\nclearly does not constitute proof of purposeful discrimination.\nThe district court also concluded that the State's failure\nto develop a remedial program specifically directed at preparing\nminority students for the PPST raised an inference of discriminatory\npurpose. The State's obligation under the Equal Protection Clause,\nhowever, is to establish legitimate standards that are adopted and\nadministered without regard to race. It has no general duty to\nengage in affirmative action to help those who have been unable to\nsatisfy those standards. A state may, of course, voluntarily\nundertake such efforts; to hold that its failure to do so raises an\ninference of discriminatory intent, however, would impose indirectly\nan obligation the court may not impose directly.\n\n- 30 -\nIn any event, the State of Texas maintains a full network\nof junior colleges that offer remedial instruction in basic skills.\nWhile these programs were not specifically designed to help students\npass the PPST, they do attempt to teach the basic skills that it\ntests. These programs may not be as effective as those devised by\nsome of the senior colleges. But whatever their shortcomings,\nthey are not evidence of discriminatory intent.\nThe district court found it \"particularly disturbing\" that\nin responding to a teacher shortage, the State decided to\nallow college graduates who pass the PPST to become teachers without\nhaving to take teacher training. The State could certainly conclude,\nhowever, that it was more important for prospective teachers to\nhave basic skills than formal teacher training. Such a bona fide\neducational decision made by competent state officials cannot be\nevidence of discriminatory intent.\nThe district court found that the State had displayed an\nattitude that minorities had only themselves to blame for their\npoor performance. In support of this finding, the district court\ncited the testimony of Dr. Bergin, the Deputy Commissioner of Educa-\ntion. In her testimony, Dr. Bergin did not attempt to explain the\nreason for the disparity in performance among racial groups. Instead,\nshe offered her views on why people of all races have failed the\ntest (Tr. 1629). As the district court found, she gave three reasons:\nlack of intellectual ability, failure to work hard in class, and\nteachers' lack of basic skills (ibid.). These three reasons may not\n\n- 31 -\nexhaust the universe of possible explanations for failure on the\ntest. But they certainly do not supply \nany reason to believe that\nDr. Bergin's support for \nthe PPST was motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\nFinally, the district court found it \"extremely significant\"\nthat at the time the Board adopted the PPST, it consisted of 27\nmembers, only one of whom was black and only three of whom were\nHispanic. There is no basis in law or logic, however, for\npresuming that a legislative or administrative body that is\npredominantly of one race has acted with discriminatory intent.\nCf. Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 499 (1977).(cid:9) Indeed, if\nthe racial composition of a legislative or administrative body\nwere a sufficient reason for an inference of discriminatory intent,\nfew decisions could survive judicial review.\nIn sum, none of the evidence relied upon by the district\ncourt suggests that appellees will be able to show that the Board\nadopted and implemented the PPST requirement with discriminatory\nintent. The district court's finding that the evidence \"strongly\nsuggests\" that the Board acted with discriminatory intent is based\non an improper legal standard and is clearly erroneous.\nB. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their Due Process claim\nTo invoke the protection of the Due Process Clause, appellees\nwere required to show that the State's use of the PPST deprived\nthem of either a \"liberty\" or \"property\" interest. Board of Regents\n\n- 32 -\nv. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972). The district court held that\nappellees had a liberty interest in pursuing the occupation of\ntheir choice and that the State's use of the PPST deprived them of\nthat interest. According to the court, appellees' liberty interest\nentitled them to adequate notice of the PPST requirement. Finding\nthat the State had given appellees little notice and no materials\non the nature of the requirement other than a pamphlet, the court\nconcluded that appellees were likely to prevail on their Due Process\nclaim. The court's analysis is seriously deficient.\nTo begin with, the district court's reasoning fails to take\ninto account that when a state adopts a uniform standard of general\napplicability, such as a competency test of basic skills, it does\nnot ordinarily trigger any requirement that procedural due process\nbe accorded to each affected person individually. It is only when\nthe standards are structured to require more individualized deter-\nminations in their application -- such as findings of good character\n-- that individual notice and an opportunity to be heard are required.\nIn Nolan v. Ramsey, 597 F.2d 577 (5th Cir. 1979), this\nCourt applied this principle in rejecting a Due Process challenge\nto a state commission's decision to replace stenomask reporters\nwith stenographers. This Court explained that procedural due\nprocess only applies \"where an individual is singled out and denied\nthe right to pursue a profession or occupation based upon personal\ncharacteristics.\" Id. at 580. Since the commission's decision\napplied uniformly to all stenomask reporters, this Court held,\nprocedural Due Process was not required. Ibid.\n\n- 33 -\nSecond, the district court's reasoning ignores the distinction\nthis Court has drawn between \"a court's power to review disciplinary\nactions by educational institutions on the one hand, and academic\ndecisions on the other hand.\" Mahavongsanan V. Hall, 529 F.2d\n448, 449 (1976). \nIn Mahavongsanan, this Court expressly upheld a\nstate university's decision to deny a master's degree to an individ-\nual who had failed a comprehensive examination, even though the\nuniversity had failed to give her notice and an opportunity to be\nheard. This Court explained that while prior decisions recognized\nthat students were entitled to certain procedural Due Process\nprotections, those cases \"have been carefully limited to disciplinary\ndecisions.\" Id. at 449. The Court went on to state that \"'[we] know\nof no case which holds that colleges and universities are subject\nto the supervision or review of the courts in the uniform application\nof their academic standards.'\" Id. at 449-450 (quoting Wright v.\nTexas Southern University, 392 F.2d 728, 729 (5th Cir. 1968)).\nThird, while this Court has held that \"a person has a liberty\ninterest in pursuing an occupation\" (Phillips v. Vandygriff, 711\nF.2d 1217, 1222 (5th Cir. 1983)(citing cases)), the PPST requirement\ndoes not significantly deprive appellees of this interest. As the\ndistrict court found, students can retake the PPST an unlimited\nnumber of times. Accordingly, failure on the PPST does not\nabsolutely deprive appellees of the opportunity to teach in Texas;\n4/\nit merely means that they must take the test again.\n4/ Of course, some students may fail the test no matter how many\ntimes they take it. As to those students, however, notice is not\nan issue.\n\nThis Court's decision in Tyler v. Vickery, 517 F.2d 1089\n(1975), demonstrates the importance of this distinction. In that\ncase, this Court held that although \"[t]he safeguards of the due\nprocess clause are * * * available to a failing bar applicant,\" a\nstate is not required to give such an applicant a hearing. Id. at\n1103. In reaching this conclusion, this Court attached critical\nsignificance to the fact that the state gave those who failed the\nexam an unqualified right to retake it six months later. Id. at\n1103-1105. The Court specifically explained its decision as\nfollows (id. at 1104-1105):\n[F]ailure on a bar examination does not stigmatize\nan individual as 'incompetent,' but merely indicates\nthat he did not demonstrate minimal competence on a\nparticular examination. Upon reexamination, such an\nindividual is entitled to have his paper graded by\nthe same standards as those of everyone else, and if\nhe passes, to be admitted on precisely the same basis\nas an applicant who had not previously taken the exami-\nnation.\nFor these reasons, this Court concluded, \"the 'liberty interest'\na failing examinee has at stake [is] a minor, if not a non-existent\none.\" Id. at 1105.\nThis Court held in Mahavongsanan, 529 F.2d at 449, that a court\nmay review decisions concerning academic standards if they are \"shown\nto be clearly arbitrary or capricious.\" But as the Supreme Court\nindicated in Board of Curators of the University of Missouri v.\nHorowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 92 (1978), courts \"are particularly ill-\nequipped to evaluate [such decisions]\" and this consideration \"warn[s]\nagainst any such judicial intrusion into academic decisionmaking.\"\nHere, the district court never identified precisely why it would\n\n- 35 -\nbe arbitrary or capricious for a state to give college students\na 12th grade level test on basic skills without advance notice,\nparticularly since the state gives those students an unlimited\nopportunity to retake the test. After all, the purpose of this\ntest is to determine whether college students possess basic skills\nat the high school level.\nIn any event, the legislation passed in 1981 expressly\nprovided that students seeking admission into teacher education\nprograms would have to pass a test on \"basic skills\" (Texas Educa-\ntion Code, Section 13.032). In January 1982, the State Board\npublished a rule specifying that this requirement would take effect\non May 1, 1984 and sent copies of the rule to all colleges and\nuniversities (Veselka Dep. 18, 96). In the same year, the State\nBoard required all colleges and universities to include notice of\nthe testing requirement in their catalogues (Tr. 1163). Thus,\neven assuming the Due Process Clause required some kind of notice\nof the testing requirement, the State fulfilled this requirement.\nMoreover, in the spring of 1983, the State Board sent a\npamphlet to all college students notifying them of the testing\nrequirement (id. at 95-96; Deft. Ex. 10). That pamphlet explained\nthat the test would cover basic skills in reading, writing and\narithmetic, and gave descriptions of the content that would be\ncovered on each section (Deft. Ex. 10). It also informed students\nto contact their local institutions or the Texas Education Agency\nfor additional information about the test (ibid.).(cid:9) While we\ndo not believe these additional steps were required, they surely\nrefute any possible suggestion that the State failed to provide\nappellees with adequate notice.\n\n- 36 -\nThe district court apparently believed that the State\nshould have given students additional preparation materials, such as\nskill \nsample test questions and a more detailed list of the  areas\n5/\ncovered by the test.(cid:9) obviously, information of this kind would\nhave been helpful. But it would trivialize the Due Process Clause\nto hold that a state is constitutionally precluded from giving\ncollege students a 12th grade level test on basic skills in reading,\nwriting, and arithmetic unless it provides them with sample test\nquestions first.\nIn sum, appellees are unlikely to prevail on their claim\nthat the State's imposition of the PPST requirement violated their\nrights under the Due Process Clause. The district court's contrary\n6/\nholding is based on a misapplication of the governing legal standards.\n5/ The State did supply this kind of material upon request to some\nstudents and many institutions (Tr. 1171; Veselka Dep. 96-98, 100-102;\nDeft. Ex. 11). It did not systematically provide such information\nto all students and all institutions, however (Veselka Dep. 98).\n6/ Appellees also claim that the PPST violates Due Process because\nit tests material they have not been taught. Citing this Court's\ndecision in Debra P. V. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397, 404 (1981), the\ndistrict court held that if the PPST tests skills the State has\nnot taught, its use would violate Due Process (Mem. 38). The\ncourt found, however, that insufficient evidence had been presented\nto decide the likelihood of appellees' prevailing on this factual\nissue. The district court erred in extrapolating from Debra P. a\nuniversal rule that a test covering material not previously taught\nviolates Due Process. Debra P. dealt with a high school graduation\ntest. Nothing in Debra P. suggests that this principle applies\nto tests used for admission into professional schools and ultimately\ninto the profession itself. A state has a legitimate interest in\npreventing those who lack basic skills from becoming teachers.\nThat interest does not disappear simply because the reason particular\nindividuals lack basic skills is that they have not been taught\nthem. It may seem unfair to test students on material they have\nnot been taught. It is more unfair, however, to impose on young\nchildren teachers who lack basic skills. Because the district\ncourt premised its finding of a probable Due Process violation on\nlack of adequate notice and did not reach appellees' alternative\nDue Process claim, this Court need not decide this issue now.\n\n- 37 -\nC. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their Title VI claim\nThe district court held that appellees were also likely to\nprevail on their claim under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d), which prohibits discrimination in federally\nassisted programs. The district court premised this holding entirely\non its previous conclusion that appellees were likely to prevail\non their claim that the State's use of the PPST was motivated by\ndiscriminatory intent in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\nAs we have discussed, the district court's finding on intent\nis based on an improper legal standard and is clearly erroneous.\nSince the court's analysis under Title VI simply tracks its\nanalysis under the Equal Protection Clause, it suffers from precisely\n7/\nthe same errors.\n7/Appellees claim that the State's use of the PPST also violates\na Title VI regulation that prohibits a recipient of federal\nfinancial assistance from using \"criteria or methods of\nadministration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to\ndiscrimination * * *.\" 34 C.E.R. 100.3(b)(2). Because the district\ncourt refrained from addressing whether appellees were likely\nto prevail on this claim, that issue is not before this Court\non this appeal.\n\n- 38 -\nD. The district court erred in holding that appellees were\nlikely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Educational\nOpportunity Act\nThe district court held (Mem. 45-47) that there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that appellees will prevail on their\nclaim that the PPST violates the Equal Educational Opportunities\nAct of 1974 (EEOA). Specifically, the court relied upon the\nsection which provides that no State shall deny equal educational\nopportunity by its failure to \"take affirmative steps * * * to\nremove the vestiges of a dual school system\" (20 U.S.C. 1703(b)).\nTaking \"judicial notice of its own findings regarding the nature\nof the Texas school systems over the years * * *\" (Mem. 46), the\ncourt reasoned that many students now seeking to become teachers\nmust have received some years of their education in imperfectly-\ndesegregated schools. It follows, the court held, that the\ndisproportionate failure rate was, itself, a vestige of past\ndiscrimination. This analysis is fundamentally flawed for several\nreasons.\nFirst, the EEOA does not impose any obligations upon higher\neducation systems or authorities. It is limited in effect to\nthe activities of state and local educational agencies at the\nelementary and secondary levels. See 20 U.S.C. 1720(a) and\n(b); 20 U.S.C. 881(f) and (k). Accordingly, the EEOA imposes\nno obligations, remedial or otherwise on the higher education\nsystem in Texas. Acceptance of the District Court's holding\nwould constitute an unwarranted extension of the Debra P. rule\n\n- 39 -\nto govern admission to systems of higher education which receive\nsome or most of their students from non-unitary systems. Such\nan extension of Debra P. conflicts with basic principles of\nfederal remedial authority and Equal Protection analysis.\nHigher education systems, even in formerly de jure states,\nhave no constitutional or statutory obligation to suspend or\nlower perfectly valid academic standards to accommodate high\nschool students who may be ill-prepared because of prior con-\nstitutional violations by local and elementary school systems.\nAs previously noted, the Supreme Court cases delineating the\nfundamental limitations on federal remedial authority in\ndesegregation cases make clear that imposing such an obligation\non a higher education system would be impermissible because\nthe scope of such remedies necessarily exceeds the \"nature\nand extent of the violation,\" General Building Contractors\nAssn., supra, 458 U.S. at 399. Accord, Swann, supra, 402 U.S.\nat 22-23; Pasadena Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 436\n(1976); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 746-747 (1974)\n(Milliken I). The higher education entities in this case\ncannot be required to correct discrimination by other entities\nin Texas any more than the suburban school districts in Milliken\nI could be required to correct Detroit's segregative practices.\nTo conclude otherwise would mean that a state that once practiced\nschool segregation may not set minimum standards for any trade\nthat involves state licensing -- even those not related to\n\n- 40 -\neducation -- e.g., barbers and plumbers. All standard-setting,\nby this reckoning, superimposes penalties on the victims of\npast discrimination.\nMoreover, wholly apart from the question of whether\nfederal courts can require such \"remedial\" action, we submit\nthat a prohibition against otherwise valid academic standards\nin this context does not, in any meaningful way, counteract the\neffects of past segregation -- indeed such a rule will serve to\nperpetuate such effects. No one disputes the unfortunate fact\nthat past racial discrimination in public schools (and other\nareas) has adversely affected the educational achievement levels\nof minority students in formerly segregated (and other) schools.\nBut it clearly makes no sense, from a constitutional perspective,\nto \"solve\" that problem by enjoining or fundamentally altering\notherwise valuable academic programs that serve an essential\neducational function. It is difficult to conceive of what\n\"advantage\" is secured to the purported beneficiaries of a\ndoctrine which prohibits universities from applying to them the\nsame valid academic standards imposed on their colleagues. It\nis only a most otiose -- if not perverse -- notion of equality\nthat prevents such neutral inquiry into whether students possess\nthe basic school skills required of others in the professions\nthey seek to enter. Any educational deficiencies suffered by\nminority students in elementary and secondary schools are not\ncorrected by such a scheme, they are simply enshrined in\n\nmow\nperpetuity. In short, adoption of such a doctrine would be to\n\"celebrate and perpetuate the hollow certification that accom-\npanied black graduation pre-Brown [v. Board of Education, 347\nU.S. 483 (1954)].\" Debra P. V. Turlington, 654 F.2d 1079, 1085\n(5th Cir. 1981) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from denial of rehear-\ning en banc).\nBut even assuming the would-be teachers benefit from not\nbeing held to generally applicable academic requirements, such\na rule surely will have no such beneficial effect on their\nfuture students. The state is surely not required to impose on\nfuture generations the stunting effects of past discrimination.\nPermitting people to teach who themselves lack basic skills\nwould do exactly that. Moreover, far from supplying students\nwith genuine \"minority role models,\" disallowing an examination\nof whether minority teachers possess basic skills can only have\na stigmatizing effect on them and a deleterious effect on those\nwhom they teach. It is presumably for this reason that this\nCourt has permitted school districts that are in the process of\ndesegregating to utilize examinations among the objective and\nnonracial criteria for hiring, promotion, and demotion of\nteachers. 8/ Thus, the state's effort to upgrade its certified\n8/ See, e.g., Moore v. Tangipohoa Parish School Board, 594\nF.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1979); Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Educ.\n(Sumter County), 463 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1972). Of course,\nwhere the test is being used as one instrumentality of demons-\ntrable racially discriminatory purpose, the court did not\npermit it. See, e.g., Baker v. Columbus Municipal Separate\nSchool District, 462 F.2d 1112 (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n- 42 -\nteachers is a legitimate measure to correct the effects of all\nthose past practices that may have depressed the level of\nscholastic achievement in Texas.\nMoreover, there is an additional reason why application\nof the Debra P. rule is inappropriate here. State action can\nonly violate the EEOA if it directly affects some facet of\nelementary or secondary education. The student's \"expectation\"\nof a diploma may make the diploma an intrinsic perquisite or\nterm and condition of secondary education. But entrance to a\nprofessional school is not part of the normal expectation of\nall students who complete a high school curriculum. on the\ncontrary, one would think it assumed that not every high school\ngraduate is qualified to become a teacher. Nor is it part of\nthe implicit bargain between the state and its young people\nthat completion of high school will render all of them qualified\nto enter any particular trade or institution of higher learning.\nIn any event, Debra P. would be inapposite even if it\napplied. There is no evidence in the record of this case that\nwould support a finding that there has been widespread segre-\ngation in Texas' elementary and secondary schools in the past\ndecade. The first order in this case was entered in 1971, and\nthere is no basis for saying that there has been significant\nnoncompliance with that order.\n\n- 43 -\nFinally, the court failed to take account of the evidence\nshowing that the PPST is, in fact, serving a remedial purpose.\nThe record reflects that there is ample provision for remedial\neducation in the state's junior and community colleges. The\ndistrict court itself found, moreover, that the students who\nfailed the PPST have not given up, and have worked to improve\ntheir skills so that the proportion of those passing has greatly\nincreased in the last year (Mem. 21, n. 15; Tr. 1516).\nCONCLUSION\nThe district court's decision should be reversed and the\ncase should be remanded with directions to dismiss appellees'\nmotion for lack of jurisdiction. In the alternative, the\ndistrict court's decision should be reversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM ._J AD rs DLaZ(cid:9) DS\nAssistant Attorney General\nBRIAN K.

Whether the district court lacked jurisdiction?\n2. Whether the district court erred in holding that\nappellees were likely to prevail on their claims under the Equal\nProtection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act\nof 1974.\n\n- 2 -\nSTATEMENT\nA. Backaround\nIn 1981, the Texas Legislature enacted a law that requires\nstudents to pass a test on basic skills as a condition of admission\ninto a State approved teacher education program (Texas Education\nCode, Section 13.032). In January 1982, the State Board of Education\nadopted a rule specifying that this requirement would take effect\n1/\non May 1, 1984 (Veselka Dep. 18). In the summer of 1982, the\nState Board decided that the basic skills tested should include\nreading, writing, and arithmetic and that the Pre-Professional Skills\nTest (PPST) should be used to measure these skills provided that\nit could be validated for this purpose (id. at 19-20).\nIn October 1982, the State Board contracted with IOX Associates\nto perform such a validation study (id. at 23). One year later,\nIOX issued its final report concluding that the PPST was valid\n(id. at 24). In February 1984, the State Board formally approved\nthe use of the PPST and established the scores that would be necessary\nto pass the test (id. at 24-25). In March 1984, the test was\ngiven for the first time (id. at 25).\nUnder the Board's regulations, the test is given three times\nevery year, and students are permitted to take the test as many\ntimes as they wish (id. at 27, 29). If a student fails any one of\nl/ \"Dep.\" refers to Deposition; \"Mem.\" refers to the district court's\nMemorandum Opinion; \"Tr.\" refers to Transcript; \"Ex.\" refers to\nExhibit.\n\n-3-\nthe sections of the test, however, he can take no more than six\ncredits of education courses until he passes the test (id. at 79).\nStudents generally begin taking education courses in their junior\nyear.\nThe PPST is designed to test basic skills at the 12th grade\nlevel (Tr. 1182-1183). During the first year of its use, 73% of\nthe whites, 34% of the Hispanics, and 23% of the blacks who took\nthe test passed it (Pltfs,Ex. 10).\nB. Proceedings in the district court\nIn July 1985, appellees (LULAC, GI Forum, NAACP, and a\nnumber of Hispanic and black college students) filed a motion to\nenforce the statewide desegregation decree in United States v.\nState of Texas, 447 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1971) (Motion to Enforce\nDecree filed on July 19, 1985). That case began in 1971 as a suit\nto desegregate nine all-black school districts. The case was then\nexpanded and resulted in a decree requiring the State to assume\nresponsibility for the desegregation of public schools throughout\nTexas.\nIn their motion, appellees alleged that the State's use of\nthe PPST violated provisions in the decree that required the State\nto provide Hispanic and black students in the public schools with\naccess to minority teachers (id. at 1-2). In addition, appellees\nalleged that the use of the test violated the rights of students\nseeking admission into teacher education programs under the Equal\nProtection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI of the Civil\n\n-4-\nRights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d), the Equal Educational Oppor-\ntunities Act (20 U.S.C. 1703), and the contract between the United\nStates and the State of Texas guaranteeing equal education oppor-\ntunity in higher education (id. at 2-3).\nAppellees immediately moved for a preliminary injunction\npreventing the State from using the test as a barrier to admission\nto teacher education programs. After a hearing, the district\ncourt granted this motion (Memorandum Opinion filed on August 27,\n1985).\nC. The district court's decision\n1. Jurisdiction\nThe court first determined that its authority to enforce\nthe decree in United States v. State of Texas gave it jurisdiction\nto resolve appellees' motion. The court acknowledged that its\nprevious orders \"did not deal specifically with the adoption of\nthe PPST\" (Mem. 14). The court concluded, however, that the\nState's use of the PPST could frustrate the purpose of that decree.\nAccording to the court, the purpose of the decree was to enforce\nthe State's obligation to create a unitary system and this obligation\nincludes a duty to provide minority children with \"minority role\nmodels\" (id. at 14-16). Since the court found \"[a]mple evidence\"\nthat the use of the PPST would \"greatly diminish[]\" the number of\nminority teachers, the court was convinced that it had jurisdiction\nto consider the merits of appellees' attack on it (id. at 16-17).\n\n-5--\nThe court also concluded that the PPST issue fell within\nthe confines of its previous order requiring local school districts\nto use \"non-racial, non-ethnic criteria in hiring\" (id. at 17).\nThe court pointed out that if a local school district had adopted\nthe PPST as a prerequisite to hiring, the court clearly would\nhave had jurisdiction to consider whether the local district\nhad violated this provision (id. at 18-19). The court reasoned\nit should make no difference for purposes of jurisdiction that\nthe PPST requirement is State rather than locally imposed (id. at 19).\nBased on this analysis, the court not only assumed jurisdic-\ntion over appellees' claim that the State had violated the terms\nof the decree, it also assumed jurisdiction over appellees' claims\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, Title VI,\nand the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (id. at 19). The court\nrefused to consider appellees' claim that the State had violated\nits agreement to provide equal education opportunity in higher\neducation, however (id. at 19). The court explained that \"[t]he\nprogress of the State of Texas in ensuring equal educational oppor-\ntunity in colleges and universities is, jurisdictionally speaking,\nnot a concern of this court\" (id. at 20).\n2. The merits of the motion\nIn deciding to grant a preliminary injunction against use\nof the PPST, the court considered four factors: (1) the harm to\nappellees in denying an injunction; (2) the harm to the State in\n\n-6-\ngranting an injunction; (3) the public interest; and (4) the proba-\nbility that appellees would prevail on the merits (id. at 20 citing\nCamenisch v. University of Texas, 616 F.2d 127, 130 (5th Cir.\n1980)).\n'The court first found that unless an injunction were issued,\nmany students would have to postpone completion of their education\ncourses for at least six months to one year (id. at 21). This, in\nturn, would deprive students in public schools of minority teachers\n\"at a time when the state is experiencing a significant teacher\nshortage\" (ibid.). For this reason, the court concluded, appellees\nhad established irreparable harm (id. at 22).\nOn the other hand, the court found that the State would not\nsuffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction were granted.\nThe State argued that an injunction would permit students without\nthe necessary skills to take courses, would negatively affect public\nperception, and would be unfair to students who take courses only to\nfind out later that they must still pass the PPST (id. at 22). In\nthe court's view, \"none of these 'harms' [was] persuasive\" (id. at\n23). The court found that students who failed the PPST would be\nable to learn the material in their courses, that negative\npublic perception was irrelevant, and that students could make an\ninformed choice on whether to take education courses knowing that\nthey still might have to pass the PPST (id. at 23-24).\n\n-7-\nThe court concluded that the public interest also weighed\nin favor of granting an injunction. The court explained that\nsince its injunction would only permit students to enroll in courses\nand would not permit them to become certified, the public's interest\nin competent teachers was not implicated (id. at 24-25). In contrast,\nthe court found that the public's interest in alleviating the\nteacher shortage would be served by granting an injunction (id. at\n25).\nThe court finally determined that appellees were likely\nto prevail on the merits. The court recognized that to prevail on\ntheir Equal Protection claim, appellees were required to show that\nthe State had adopted the PPST with a racially discriminatory\npurpose (id. at 26). in the court's view, however, \"the most\nreliable way to determine discriminatory intent in a school desegre-\ngation case is to look at the reasonably foreseeable results of the\nactions being challenged\" (id. at 32). The court therefore viewed\nthe State's awareness that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact on black and Hispanic students as proof of discriminatory\nintent (id. at 27, 32).\nThe court also relied on several other factors as evidence\nof discriminatory intent. The court found that \"the historical\nbackground of [the] decision [was] one of repeated and recent instances\nof intentional segregation, particularly in areas of South Texas\nwhere there is a substantial Mexican-American population\" (id. at\n27). The court also found it significant that the State had failed\n\n-8-\nto attempt \"to discover whether the test itself was the source of\nthe impact or whether alternative tests existed\" (ibid.). The\ncourt was especially critical of the State's failure to \"organize\nany sort of remediation program specifically directed at preparing\nminority students for the PPST\" (id. at 27-28). In the court's\nview, \"[t]he state's passivity seem[ed] particularly callous in the\nface of the almost heroic efforts made by colleges and universities\nwith heavy minority concentrations hastily to devise makeshift\nremediation programs of their own\" (id. at 31-32).\nIn addition, the court found it \"[p]articularly disturbing\"\nthat the State had instituted an alternative certification procedure\nin response to teacher shortages resulting from the PPST (id. at\n29). Under this procedure, those graduating from college and\npassing the PPST will be allowed to teach without any courses in\nteacher education. According to the court, \"[t]he choice to sacri-\nfice the requirement of two years of training specifically directed\nat being a teacher, * * * rather than change the PPST preclusionary\nscores or petition the Legislature to allow waiver of the PPST\nrequirement, was one of the strongest indications of racial intent\npresented at the hearing\" (id. at 29).\nAs the court viewed the testimony of the State's witnesses,\nthe State's conduct seemed to have \"sprung from an attitude that\nminority students were themselves to blame for their poor performance\"\n(id. at 30-31). That attitude, the court found, was evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent (id. at 31). Finally, the court found it\n\n-9-\n\"extremely significant\" that the State Board was composed of 27\nmembers, with only one black and three Hispanic members (id. at\n32-33). As the court saw it, \"[t]his factor adds weight to [appel-\nlees'] claims of intentional discrimination, for these minority\nmembers could get no more response to their concerns about minority\nimpact than the appointment of an apparently powerless committee\nwhich met once and dissolved\" (id. at 33). The court concluded\nthat the evidence \"strongly suggests\" that the State acted with\ndiscriminatory intent in adopting the PPST and that appellees were\ntherefore likely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Protection\nClause (id. at 34).\nThe court also held that appellees were likely to prevail\non their Due Process claim. The court understood that to\nestablish a violation of the Due Process Clause, appellees were\nrequired to establish a protected liberty or property interest\n(id. at 34). The court found it unlikely that appellees would be\nable to establish a protected property interest (ibid.). The\ncourt held that since colleges and universities have always had a\nlarge measure of discretion to determine their own admission and\ncertification standards, the State had not created any property\ninterest in becoming certified as a teacher (id. at 35). The court\nconcluded, however, that the students did have a constitutionally\nprotected liberty interest \"in being able to pursue the occupation\nof their choice\" and that this interest was implicated since the\n\"[f]ailure to pass the PPST unequivocally deprives a student of\nthe opportunity to teach in Texas\" (id. at 35-36).\n\n- 10 -\nThe court held that although the scope of this Due Process\nright was unclear, it necessarily included a right to \"reasonable\nnotice of the state's requirement\" (id. at 36). The court found\nthat \"the students and teacher education programs were given very\nlittle notice of the PPST requirement and the proposed preclusionary\nscores,\" and \"no materials to help prepare for the PPST beyond a\npamphlet\" (id. at 37). For this reason, the court concluded that\nappellees were \"likely to prove that the [State] deprived them of\ntheir right to teach in Texas, without sufficient notice concerning\nthe nature and imminence of the PPST\" (id. at 38).\nThe court held that the Due Process Clause also required the\nState to show that \"students in Texas had been taught the materials\ncovered in the PPST\" (ibid. citing Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d\n397, 404 (5th Cir. 1981)). After reviewing the State's effort to\nmake this showing, as well as appellees' criticisms of that attempt,\nthe court concluded that \"insufficient evidence ha[d] been presented\non which to decide the likelihood of [appellees'] success on [this\nissue]\" (id. at 38-41).\nThe court next considered appellees' claim that the use of\nthe PPST violated the prohibition in Title VI against discrimina-\ntion in federally assisted programs. The court held that since\nthe teacher education programs receive federal financial assistance\nand Title VI affords individuals a private right of action, appellees\ncould attack the PPST under Title VI (id. at 41-45). After noting\n\n- 11 -\nthat appellees had shown a likelihood of success on their constitu-\ntional claim, the court held that \"this likelihood extends to their\ncause of action under [Title VI]\" (id. at 45).\nFinally, the court considered appellees' claim that the\nState had failed \"to take affirmative steps * * * to remove the\nvestiges of a dual school system\" as required by the Equal Educa-\ntional Opportunities Act (ibid.). As the court understood this provi-\nsion, the State could not use the PPST to prevent students who\nstill suffered the effects of the dual system from entering teacher\neducation programs (id. at 46-47). The court found that the limited\nevidence introduced at the hearing on this issue indicated that\nthe test was being applied to such students (id. at 47). The\ncourt therefore concluded that appellees had shown \"a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits of this claim\" (id. at 46-47).\nBased on its findings under the four factors (harm to\nappellees, harm to the State, the public interest, and likelihood\nof success), the district court issued a preliminary injunction\nrequiring the State to \"permit colleges and universities in the\nState of Texas to admit those students, regardless of race, to\ncourses in their Education Departments who would have been qualified\nto enroll in those courses but for their failing the [PPST]\"\n(Preliminary Injunction filed on August 27, 1985). From this\norder, the State of Texas and the United States have appealed.\n\n- 12 -\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nAppellees have challenged the State's authority to use a\nbasic skills test (the PPST) as a condition of admission into\nteacher education programs. After a hearing, the district court\ngranted appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction against\nfurther use of the test. We believe the district court erred in\ntwo important ways.\n1. Most fundamentally, the district court lacked jurisdiction\nover appellees' challenge. Appellees asserted jurisdiction under\nthe statewide desegregation decree in United States v. State of\nTexas, and the district court assumed jurisdiction entirely on that\nbasis. The State of Texas decree only requires the State to take\nresponsibility for the desegregation of elementary and secondary\nschools, however. It does not limit the State's authority in the\nfield of higher education. Since the PPST is used in colleges and\nuniversities and not in the elementary and secondary schools, the\nState of Texas decree did not give the district court jurisdiction\nto review appellees' challenge to it.\nThe district court held that minority students in the\nelementary and secondary schools have a constitutional right to\nminority teachers and that the PPST indirectly affects that right.\nBut this Court has repeatedly held that minority students have no\nsuch right. And while it is true that the PPST may ultimately\naffect the number of minority teachers, that is not a basis for\nexercising jurisdiction over a claim of discrimination in college\nadmissions. School desegregation remedies are necessarily limited\n\n- 13 -\nto eliminating discrimination that actually occurs in the public\nschools. They cannot embrace State action that occurs elsewhere\nsimply because it may indirectly affect the students in those\nschools.\n2. The district court also erred in holding that appellees\nwere likely to \nprevail on the merits. To establish a violation of\nEqual Protection, appellees were required to prove that the State's\nuse of the PPST was motivated by racially discriminatory intent.\nWhile the district court purported to follow this principle, it\nheld that the most reliable way to determine intent was to examine\nthe reasonably foreseeable results of the State's action. That\nstandard is inconsistent with controlling Supreme Court decisions\nwhich hold that it is improper to equate intent with foreseeability.\nThe available evidence does not permit an inference of\ndiscriminatory intent. The State legislation requiring competency\ntesting of basic skills was designed to improve teacher quality,\nnot to diminish the number of minority teachers. And the State\nBoard's adoption and implementation of the PPST was motivated by an\nintent to faithfully carry out the legislative mandate. Indeed,\nthe State Board did not finally approve the use of the PPST until\nit received a report that the test was a valid measure of the\nskills needed for success in teacher training and for success as a\nteacher. The evidence cited by the district court merely shows\nthat the State knew that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact and that it decided to use it anyway. That is not a\nsufficient basis for an inference of discriminatory intent.\n\n- 14 -\nThe court's holding that appellees were likely to show\nthat the State deprived them of their liberty interest in pursuing\nthe occupation of their choice without adequate notice is also in\nerror. This Court has held that general standards of uniform\napplication do not ordinarily trigger any requirement of individual\nnotice and opportunity to be heard. Moreover, this Court has held\nthat procedural Due Process, although applicable to university\ndecisions concerning student misconduct, is not fully applicable\nto academic decisions. Finally, this Court has held that while\nthere is a liberty interest in pursuing an occupation, that interest\nis not significantly implicated when there is an opportunity to\nretake the test. Although requirements that are wholly arbitrary\nor capricious violate Due Process, the district court failed to\narticulate why it would be arbitrary or capricious to give college\nstudents a test on 12th grade level basic skills without prior\nnotice. In any event, the legislation itself, the Board's\nregulations implementing the statute, and the colleges' catalogues\nall gave notice of the testing requirement long before the test\nwas first given.\nThe district court also erred in holding that appellees were\nlikely to prevail on their Title VI claim. The court's Title VI\nholding is based entirely on its prior finding of a probable Equal\nProtection violation. Since the court's Title VI analysis tracks\nits Equal Protection analysis, it suffers from the same errors.\n\n- 15 -\nFinally, \nthe district court erred in holding that appellees\nwere likely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Educational\nOpportunities Act (\"EEOA\"). The EEOA's remedial obligations extend\nonly to elementary and secondary schools. While 20 U.S.C. 1703(b),\non which the court relied, requires the dismantling of dual systems\n\"root and branch,\" it imposes no duty upon higher educational auth-\norities to compensate students for the academic deficiencies which\nmay be vestiges of past segregation in the first twelve grades.\nIndeed, colleges and universities are not required, either by the\nConstitution or by the EEOA, to lower their entrance standards to\naccommodate those students whose failure to meet minimum standards\nmay be, in part, a consequence of past discrimination in elementary\nor secondary education.\nThe court's reliance on Debra P. v. Turlington, 644 F.2d\nCir. \n397 (5th  1981), is misplaced. In that case, this Court held\nthat students who complete a high school course to the satisfaction\nof their own schools are normally entitled to expect to receive a\ndiploma. For this reason, this Court concluded, the state that\npracticed segregation during the school-life of these students\nshould not permit the consequences of that segregation to stand\nbetween the students and their diplomas. But this has no bearing\non the present case.\nEntrance into a professional school is not part of the\nnormal expectations of all students who complete high school.\nMoreover, if the district court's logic were accepted, it -would\nmean that any state that practiced segregation in the past could\nnot set minimum standards for entry into any profession. All such\nstandards could be said to penalize the victims of prior segregation.\n\n- 16 -\nThe application of Debra P. to professional standards for teachers\nis particularly inappropriate. Here what arguably may be fair\nto would-be teachers is unfair to those who will be taught. If\nthe state is required to accept into the teaching profession those\nwho cannot satisfy minimum standards, it will not remedy but perpet-\nuate the effects of past discrimination (if any) by allowing academic\ndeficiency to be passed from one generation to the next.\nIn any event, there is no evidence from which a court could\nconclude that there has been widespread school segregation in\nTexas upon which current academic deficiencies could be blamed.\nAnd even if there were, Debra P. held that a test having disparate\nimpact traceable to past discrimination can be justified if it\nhas a remedial function. Where students are spurred by the test\nto upgrade their skills, the test vindicates its usefulness. That\nis ultimately what happened in Debra P.; there is ample evidence\nthat the same is true in the present case.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE DISTRICT COURT LACKED JURISDICTION\nTO CONSIDER APPELLEES' CHALLENGE TO THE\nSTATE'S USE OF THE PPST\nAppellees have challenged the State's use of the PPST\nas a condition of admission into teacher education programs.\nAppellees did not file a complaint attacking the State's require-\nment, however. Instead, they filed a motion to enforce the state-\nwide desegregation decree in United States v. State of Texas. The\ndistrict court concluded that appellees' motion fell within its\n\n- 17 -\nauthority to enforce that decree and assumed jurisdiction over\nappellees' claims entirely on that basis. As we argued below,\nappellees' challenge to the State's use of the PPST does not impli-\ncate the decree in United States v. State of Texas. The district\ncourt should therefore have dismissed appellees' motion for lack\nof jurisdiction.\nAs this Court recently explained, United States v. State\nof Texas began as a suit to desegregate nine all-black school\ndistricts (680 F.2d 356, 358 (1982)). The case was then expanded\nand resulted in a decree directing the State to assume responsibility\nfor the desegregation of public schools throughout Texas (ibid.).\nWhile this decree is undeniably broad, it is limited to curing the\nviolation identified in that case -- racial segregation in the\nelementary and secondary schools throughout the State. United\nStates v. State of Texas did not involve allegations of discrimina-\ntion against black and Hispanic students in colleges and universities,\nand the decree therefore does not purport to circumscribe the State's\nauthority in that area. Nor could it. Under well established\nprinciples, judicial remedial authority can \"extend no farther\nthan required by the nature and extent of th[e] violation.\" General\nBuilding Contractors Assn. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 399\n(1982). Since the violation identified in United States v. State\nof Texas concerned the elementary and secondary schools, the\nremedy was required to be similarly limited.\n\n- 18 -\nThe district court's assumption of jurisdiction is inconsis-\ntent with this understanding of the United States v. State of\nTexas decree. Appellees' challenge to the State's use of the PPST\nthreatens the State's authority over colleges and universities,\nnot its authority over the public schools. The PPST is used as a\ncondition of admission into college and university education programs;\nit is not used in the State's elementary and secondary schools.\nIf the State's use of the PPST violates anyone's rights, it is the\nrights of college students seeking admission into teacher education\nprograms, not those of students attending elementary and secondary\nschools. In these circumstances, the district court had no basis\nfor asserting jurisdiction under the United States v. State of\nTexas decree.\nIn reaching a contrary conclusion, the district court\nheld that the State's use of the PPST might undermine one of the\npurposes of its decree. According to the court, one purpose of\nits decree was to enforce the State's constitutional obligation to\nprovide minority children with \"minority role models\" (Mem. 14-16).\nSince the court found that the PPST would have the effect of\ndiminishing the number of minority teachers, it felt compelled to\nconsider appellees' attack on it.\nThis reasoning is fundamentally flawed. To be sure, this\nCourt has held that discrimination in the assignment and hiring of\nteachers violates the constitutional rights of students, and\nhas insisted that desegregation remedies include a prohibition\nagainst that kind of discrimination. See Singleton v. Jackson\n\n- 19 -\nMunicipal Separate School District, 419 F.2d 1211, 1218 (1970).\nBut this Court has repeatedly held that students do not have a\nconstitutional right to minority teachers per se. Fort Bend Indepen-\ndent School District v. Stafford, 651 F.2d 1133, 1139-1140 (1981)\n(citing cases). And it has never come close to suggesting that\nstudents in the public schools have a constitutional right to have\ncollege students admitted into teacher education programs on a\nnondiscriminatory basis. To take that leap now would stretch\nthe principle involved in Singleton beyond recognition.\nIt is true that if minority students are excluded from\nteacher education programs in disproportionate numbers, it may\nreduce the number of minority teachers in the public schools and\nthis, in turn, may affect the minority students attending those\nschools. But that is not a proper basis for exercising jurisdiction\nover appellees' claims. The remedy in a school desegregation case\nmust be designed to eliminate racial discrimination that actually\noccurs in the public schools. Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\n433 U.S. 406, 419-420 (1977) (Dayton I). School desegregation cases\nare not general forums for reviewing all claims of racial discrimi-\nnation that can be said to have some effect on students attending\nthose schools.\nIndeed, in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education,\n402 U.S. 1, 22 (1971), the Supreme Court expressly rejected that\nkind of expansive notion of the role of a federal court in a school\n\n- 20 -\ndesegregation case. The Court explained that (id. at 22):\nWe are concerned in these cases with the elimina-\ntion of the discrimination inherent in the dual\nschool systems, not with myriad factors of human\nexistence which can cause discrimination in a\nmultitude of ways on racial, religious, or ethnic\ngrounds. The target of the cases from Brown I\nto the present was the dual school system. \nThe\nelimination of racial discrimination in public\nschools is a large task and one that should not\nbe retarded by efforts to achieve broader purposes\n* * *• One vehicle can carry only a limited amount\nof baggage. It would not serve the important\nobjective of Brown I to seek to use school dese-\ngregation cases for purposes beyond their scope.\nThe Court went on to stress that the objective in a school\ndesegregation case \"is to see that school authorities exclude no\npupil of a racial minority from any school, directly or indirectly,\non account of race; it does not and cannot embrace all the problems\nof racial prejudice, even when those problems contribute to\ndisproportionate racial concentrations in some schools. Id. at 23\n(emphasis added).\nThe principles established in Swann are controlling here.\nAt its core, appellees' complaint is that the State's use of the\nPPST violates the rights of college students seeking admission\ninto teacher education programs. The State's policy will admittedly\nhave an indirect effect on minority students attending public\nschools. But this fact alone cannot transform a higher education\ncase into a public school desegregation case.\nAt one point, the district court recognized that it had no\nauthority over the State's activities in the field of higher\neducation. In refusing to exercise jurisdiction over appellees'\n\n- 21 -\nclaim that the State's use of the PPST violated its agreement to\nprovide equal education opportunity in higher education, the court\nexplained that \"[t]he progress of the State of Texas in ensuring\nequal educational opportunity in colleges and universities is,\njurisdictionally speaking, not a concern of this court\" (Mem. 20).\nThis statement is exactly right. Rather than simply leading the\ncourt to refuse jurisdiction over appellees' claim that the State\nhad breached its higher education agreement, however, it should\nhave led the court to decline jurisdiction over all of appellees'\nclaims.\nThis Court has recently noted that under the authority of\nthe United States v State of Texas decree, the district court\nhas engaged in a \"general undertaking to supervise broad aspects\nof Texas' educational system and policy.\" United States v. •State\nof Texas, supra, 680 F.2d at 358. While this Court approved\nthe court's authority to continue to enforce outstanding orders,\nit cautioned the district court to avoid extending its authority\ninto new areas that do not come within the specific terms of the\ndecree. Id. at 374. the district court failed to heed this caution.\nIn sum, the district court's authority to enforce its decree\nin United States v. State of Texas did not give it jurisdiction\nto decide the merits of appellees' attack on the State's use of\nthe PPST. This Court should therefore vacate the district court's\npreliminary injunction and remand with directions to dismiss\n\n- 22 -\n2/\nappellees' motion to enforce the decree.\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT\nAPPELLEES WERE LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE\nMERITS\nEven assuming the district court had jurisdiction, it should\nnot have granted appellees' motion for preliminary relief. To\nprevail on their motion, appellees were required to show: (1) a\nsubstantial likelihood that they would prevail on the merits; (2)\nthat they would suffer irreparable injury; (3) that this injury\noutweighed any harm to the State; and (4) that a preliminary\ninjunction would serve the public interest. Canal Authority of the\nState of Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 572 (5th Cir. 1974).\nWhether or not appellees carried their burden on the other factors,\nthey most assuredly did not establish a likelihood of success on\nthe merits. While the district court held that appellees had\nshown probable violations of the Equal Protection Clause, the Due\nProcess Clause, Title VI, and the Equal Educational Opportunities\nAct, those holdings are in error.\n2/ As an alternative ground for assuming jurisdiction, the district\ncourt held that the PPST issue fell within its order requiring\nnon-racial, non-ethnic criteria to be used in hiring (Mem. 17).\nThis conclusion is incorrect. The order referred to by the court\nsimply directs the State to \"require each county or local educational\nagency [applying for State funds] to include * * * a list of objec-\ntive, non-racial, and non-ethnic criteria * * * by which it will\njudge prospective employees for faculty and staff positions.\"\nState of Texas, supra, 447 F.2d at 446. The order thus concerns\nthe kind of criteria local districts must use in making hiring\ndecisions. It has nothing to do with the kind of criteria the\nState must use in formulating college admission standards.\n\n- 23 -\nA. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their claim under the Eaual Protection Clause\nIn the first year of its administration, 73% of the whites,\n34% of the Hispanics, and 23% of the blacks who took the PPST passed\nit. These statistics lie at the heart of appellees' claim that the\n3/\nState's use of PPST violates the Equal Protection Clause.\nOf course, it is now well established that a law or other\nofficial act will not be held unconstitutional solely because it has\na racially disproportionate impact. Personnel Administrator v.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426\nU.S. 229, 239 (1976). A violation of equal protection can be found\nonly if the impact \"can be traced to a racially discriminatory\npurpose.\" Feeney, supra, 442 U.S. at 272. In Davis, the Supreme\nCourt upheld a police department's employment test, even though it\nscreened out four times as many blacks as whites. In Arlington\nHeights, the Court upheld a municipality's zoning decision even\nthough it tended to perpetuate racially segregated housing patterns.\nAnd in Feeney, a case involving an allegation of sex rather than race\ndiscrimination, the Court upheld a state's veterans preference\neven though it made all but 2% of the women in the state ineligible\nfor state civil service jobs.\n3(cid:9) During the past year, there has been significant improvement in\nblack and Hispanic pass rates (Tr. 827, 1516). This trend can be\nexpected to continue. Indeed, one educator from a predominantly\nminority institution predicted that 70% of this year's freshmen would\neventually pass the test (Tr. 828). Thus, while the PPST may\ncontinue to have a disparate effect for some time, the statistics\ncited above considerably overstate the likely magnitude of that\neffect.\n\n- 24 -\nThe district court purported to follow the principle\ninvolved in these cases. Thus, the district court stated that\n\"[in order to prevail on their claim that the imposition of the\nPPST and the determination of preclusionary scores violated the\nEqual \nProtection clause [appellees] must show that [the State]\nacted with discriminatory intent or purpose\" (Mem. 26).(cid:9) The\ndistrict court went on to hold, however, \"that the most reliable\nway to determine discriminatory intent in a school desegregation\ncase is to look at the reasonably foreseeable results of the actions\nbeing challenged\" (id. at 32).\nThis holding is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision\nin Feeney . In that case, the lower court, relying on the same fore-\nseeability standard applied by the district court here, found that\nthe state's veterans preference reflected intentional discrimination\nagainst women. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the lower\ncourt had applied the wrong legal standard. The Court explained\nthat discriminatory purpose \"implies more than intent as volition\nor intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the\ndecisionmaker * * •} selected or reaffirmed a particular course of\naction at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,'\nits adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" 442 U.S. at 279.\nIn adopting a foreseeability standard for determining\ndiscriminatory intent, the district court relied on this Court's\ndecision in United States v. Texas Education Agency, 579 F.2d 910\n913-914 (1978). That decision, however, came before the Supreme\nCourt's decision in Feeney. To the extent that language in that\n\n- 25 -\nopinion suggests that it would be appropriate to equate intent\nwith foreseeability, it is inconsistent with Feeney and should not\nbe followed.\nAppellees appear to suggest that Feeney does not apply to\nrace discrimination cases (Response to Stay Motion 11). But in\nFeeney itself, the Court made clear that the same standard of\nintent governs both sex and race discrimination cases.\n442 U.S. at 273-274. And the Court has since applied the Feeney\ntest of intent in a race discrimination case. Washington v.\nSeattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 471 (1982).\nThe decisions in Columbus Board of Education v. Penick,\n443 U.S. 449 (1979) and Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\n443 U.S. 526 (1979)(Dayton II), cited by appellees, are not con-\ntrary. Indeed, in Dayton II, the Court expressly rejected the\nSixth Circuit's holding that a presumption of segregative purpose\narises from proof that actions have had a foreseeably segregative\neffect. 443 U.S. at 536 n.9. The Court explained that (ibid.):\n(w)e have never held that as a general proposition\nthe foreseeability of segregative consequences\nmakes out a prima facie case of purposeful racial\ndiscrimination and shifts the burden of producing\nevidence to the defendants if they are to escape\njudgment; and even more clearly there is no warrant\nin our cases for holding that such foreseeability\nroutinely shifts the burden of persuasion to the\ndefendants.\nOf course, as the Supreme Court has made clear, foresee-\nability of disparate impact is one kind of relevant evidence on the\nissue of discriminatory purpose. Dayton II, 443 U.S. at 536 n.9;\n\n- 26 -\nColumbus, 443 U.S. at 464-465. But that is far different from\nsaying, as the district court did, that foreseeability is tantamount\nto, or is the most reliable way to determine, discriminatory intent.\nThus, to establish a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause, appellees were required to show that the State adopted\nand implemented the PPST \"because of\" rather than merely \"in spite\nof\" its effect on black and Hispanic students seeking admission\ninto teacher education programs. The fact that the State knew\nfrom its pilot testing that the PPST would have a disproportionate\nimpact on black and Hispanic students, while relevant on this\nissue, is far from proof of such a purpose.\nThe district court never found that appellees were likely to\nshow that the State's use of the PPST reflected intentional discrimina-\ntion in the sense demanded by Feeney. Nor is such a finding possible.\nThe State Board's adoption of the PPST was a direct response\nto legislation requiring that students pass a test on basic skills\nas a condition of admission into teacher education programs. The\nlegislature acted against the background of reports that the quality\nof students entering the teaching profession had been declining\nover time and that many now lacked the basic skills necessary to\nperform satisfactorily as teachers (Kirby Dep.'8-9). By requiring\ncompetency testing, the legislature sought to reverse this trend\nand to insure that the State's future teachers would have the\nnecessary basic skills (ibid.). The legislature's rationale for\nrequiring students to pass the test before entering teacher education\n\n- 27 -\nprograms was that students not only need basic skills to become\nsuccessful teachers, they also need them to profit from teacher\neducation courses (id. at 18-19). The legitimacy of these legisla-\ntive judgments is beyond dispute.\nAppellees have never suggested otherwise. Instead, appellees\nclaim that while the legislature's decision to impose competency\ntesting may have been motivated by a legitimate desire to improve\nteacher quality, the State Board's adoption and implementation\nof the PPST was motivated by an intent to diminish the number of\nminority teachers. The record does not support this claim.\nThe undisputed evidence shows that the State Board responded\nto the legislature's mandate as follows: The Board first determined\nthat the basic skills tested should include reading, writing and\narithmetic (Veselka Dep. 19). After considering a number of possible\ntests to measure these skills (id. at 19-20), the Board tentatively\nselected the PPST because it was the only test on the market speci-\nfically designed to test these skills at the level needed for\nentry into teacher education programs (id. at 60-61). Thereafter,\nthe Board hired IOX Associates to determine whether the PPST was\nvalid for its intended purpose (id. at 23). After IOX Associates\nissued a detailed report concluding that the PPST did measure\nskills needed for successful training and job performance, the\nBoard formally approved its use (id. at 24-25; Pltfs. Ex. 1, pp.\n24-27). At the same time, the Board adopted passing scores of\n51% for the math section, 55% for the reading section, and 58%\n\n- 28 -\nfor the writing section (Pltfs. Ex. 4;). Finally, the Board estab-\nlished a rule that students could take the test an unlimited number\nof times (Veselka Dep. 28-29). Nothing in this sequence of events\nremotely suggests that the Board's actions were governed by a\ndesire to prevent blacks \nand Hispanics from becoming teachers.\nThe district court found that the historical background of\nthe decision was one of \"repeated and recent instances of intentional\nsegregation, particularly in areas of South Texas where there is a\nsubstantial Mexican-American population\" (Mein. 27). The court did\nnot cite any evidence, however, to support this finding. The court\ndid cite two of this Court's decisions as support for its conclusion:\nUnited States v. Texas Education Agency, 679 F.2d 1104 (5th Cir.\n1982) (Port Arthur) and United States v. Texas Education Agency\n647 F.2d 504 (5th Cir. 1981) (South Park). But these cases involved\nallegations that local school districts had failed to fully desegre-\ngate their black students: Neither of these cases involved allega-\ntions of purposeful segregation against Mexican-Americans and\nneither case implicated the State in any way. The district court's\nfinding on this point is therefore clearly erroneous.\nThe district court also found that the Board's failure to\nconsider alternative tests after it learned that the PPST would\nhave a disproportionate impact was evidence of discriminatory intent.\nBut the proper inquiry is whether the test selected by the Board\nwas prompted by a legitimate purpose. Having selected a test\nthat was designed to measure the skills it thought necessary,\n\n- 29 -\nand having received a report that the test in fact measured those\nskills, the Board had no obligation to search for a test that\nwould maximize the minority pass rate. See Furnco Const.\nCorp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577-578 (1978).\t Moreover, the\nBoard had already considered a wide range of alternative tests\nbefore adopting the PPST and had rejected them because they were\nnot designed to measure the skills needed for entry into teacher\neducation programs (Veselka Dep. 60-61). In any event, appellees\nintroduced no evidence that there was another test in existence\nthat could measure the skills the Board thought necessary without\nproducing a similar disproportionate effect. See Albemarle Paper\nCo. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975). Thus, the Board's decision\nto proceed with the PPST, rather than considering other tests,\nclearly does not constitute proof of purposeful discrimination.\nThe district court also concluded that the State's failure\nto develop a remedial program specifically directed at preparing\nminority students for the PPST raised an inference of discriminatory\npurpose. The State's obligation under the Equal Protection Clause,\nhowever, is to establish legitimate standards that are adopted and\nadministered without regard to race. It has no general duty to\nengage in affirmative action to help those who have been unable to\nsatisfy those standards. A state may, of course, voluntarily\nundertake such efforts; to hold that its failure to do so raises an\ninference of discriminatory intent, however, would impose indirectly\nan obligation the court may not impose directly.\n\n- 30 -\nIn any event, the State of Texas maintains a full network\nof junior colleges that offer remedial instruction in basic skills.\nWhile these programs were not specifically designed to help students\npass the PPST, they do attempt to teach the basic skills that it\ntests. These programs may not be as effective as those devised by\nsome of the senior colleges. But whatever their shortcomings,\nthey are not evidence of discriminatory intent.\nThe district court found it \"particularly disturbing\" that\nin responding to a teacher shortage, the State decided to\nallow college graduates who pass the PPST to become teachers without\nhaving to take teacher training. The State could certainly conclude,\nhowever, that it was more important for prospective teachers to\nhave basic skills than formal teacher training. Such a bona fide\neducational decision made by competent state officials cannot be\nevidence of discriminatory intent.\nThe district court found that the State had displayed an\nattitude that minorities had only themselves to blame for their\npoor performance. In support of this finding, the district court\ncited the testimony of Dr. Bergin, the Deputy Commissioner of Educa-\ntion. In her testimony, Dr. Bergin did not attempt to explain the\nreason for the disparity in performance among racial groups. Instead,\nshe offered her views on why people of all races have failed the\ntest (Tr. 1629). As the district court found, she gave three reasons:\nlack of intellectual ability, failure to work hard in class, and\nteachers' lack of basic skills (ibid.). These three reasons may not\n\n- 31 -\nexhaust the universe of possible explanations for failure on the\ntest. But they certainly do not supply \nany reason to believe that\nDr. Bergin's support for \nthe PPST was motivated by discriminatory\nintent.\nFinally, the district court found it \"extremely significant\"\nthat at the time the Board adopted the PPST, it consisted of 27\nmembers, only one of whom was black and only three of whom were\nHispanic. There is no basis in law or logic, however, for\npresuming that a legislative or administrative body that is\npredominantly of one race has acted with discriminatory intent.\nCf. Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 499 (1977).(cid:9) Indeed, if\nthe racial composition of a legislative or administrative body\nwere a sufficient reason for an inference of discriminatory intent,\nfew decisions could survive judicial review.\nIn sum, none of the evidence relied upon by the district\ncourt suggests that appellees will be able to show that the Board\nadopted and implemented the PPST requirement with discriminatory\nintent. The district court's finding that the evidence \"strongly\nsuggests\" that the Board acted with discriminatory intent is based\non an improper legal standard and is clearly erroneous.\nB. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their Due Process claim\nTo invoke the protection of the Due Process Clause, appellees\nwere required to show that the State's use of the PPST deprived\nthem of either a \"liberty\" or \"property\" interest. Board of Regents\n\n- 32 -\nv. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569 (1972). The district court held that\nappellees had a liberty interest in pursuing the occupation of\ntheir choice and that the State's use of the PPST deprived them of\nthat interest. According to the court, appellees' liberty interest\nentitled them to adequate notice of the PPST requirement. Finding\nthat the State had given appellees little notice and no materials\non the nature of the requirement other than a pamphlet, the court\nconcluded that appellees were likely to prevail on their Due Process\nclaim. The court's analysis is seriously deficient.\nTo begin with, the district court's reasoning fails to take\ninto account that when a state adopts a uniform standard of general\napplicability, such as a competency test of basic skills, it does\nnot ordinarily trigger any requirement that procedural due process\nbe accorded to each affected person individually. It is only when\nthe standards are structured to require more individualized deter-\nminations in their application -- such as findings of good character\n-- that individual notice and an opportunity to be heard are required.\nIn Nolan v. Ramsey, 597 F.2d 577 (5th Cir. 1979), this\nCourt applied this principle in rejecting a Due Process challenge\nto a state commission's decision to replace stenomask reporters\nwith stenographers. This Court explained that procedural due\nprocess only applies \"where an individual is singled out and denied\nthe right to pursue a profession or occupation based upon personal\ncharacteristics.\" Id. at 580. Since the commission's decision\napplied uniformly to all stenomask reporters, this Court held,\nprocedural Due Process was not required. Ibid.\n\n- 33 -\nSecond, the district court's reasoning ignores the distinction\nthis Court has drawn between \"a court's power to review disciplinary\nactions by educational institutions on the one hand, and academic\ndecisions on the other hand.\" Mahavongsanan V. Hall, 529 F.2d\n448, 449 (1976). \nIn Mahavongsanan, this Court expressly upheld a\nstate university's decision to deny a master's degree to an individ-\nual who had failed a comprehensive examination, even though the\nuniversity had failed to give her notice and an opportunity to be\nheard. This Court explained that while prior decisions recognized\nthat students were entitled to certain procedural Due Process\nprotections, those cases \"have been carefully limited to disciplinary\ndecisions.\" Id. at 449. The Court went on to state that \"'[we] know\nof no case which holds that colleges and universities are subject\nto the supervision or review of the courts in the uniform application\nof their academic standards.'\" Id. at 449-450 (quoting Wright v.\nTexas Southern University, 392 F.2d 728, 729 (5th Cir. 1968)).\nThird, while this Court has held that \"a person has a liberty\ninterest in pursuing an occupation\" (Phillips v. Vandygriff, 711\nF.2d 1217, 1222 (5th Cir. 1983)(citing cases)), the PPST requirement\ndoes not significantly deprive appellees of this interest. As the\ndistrict court found, students can retake the PPST an unlimited\nnumber of times. Accordingly, failure on the PPST does not\nabsolutely deprive appellees of the opportunity to teach in Texas;\n4/\nit merely means that they must take the test again.\n4/ Of course, some students may fail the test no matter how many\ntimes they take it. As to those students, however, notice is not\nan issue.\n\nThis Court's decision in Tyler v. Vickery, 517 F.2d 1089\n(1975), demonstrates the importance of this distinction. In that\ncase, this Court held that although \"[t]he safeguards of the due\nprocess clause are * * * available to a failing bar applicant,\" a\nstate is not required to give such an applicant a hearing. Id. at\n1103. In reaching this conclusion, this Court attached critical\nsignificance to the fact that the state gave those who failed the\nexam an unqualified right to retake it six months later. Id. at\n1103-1105. The Court specifically explained its decision as\nfollows (id. at 1104-1105):\n[F]ailure on a bar examination does not stigmatize\nan individual as 'incompetent,' but merely indicates\nthat he did not demonstrate minimal competence on a\nparticular examination. Upon reexamination, such an\nindividual is entitled to have his paper graded by\nthe same standards as those of everyone else, and if\nhe passes, to be admitted on precisely the same basis\nas an applicant who had not previously taken the exami-\nnation.\nFor these reasons, this Court concluded, \"the 'liberty interest'\na failing examinee has at stake [is] a minor, if not a non-existent\none.\" Id. at 1105.\nThis Court held in Mahavongsanan, 529 F.2d at 449, that a court\nmay review decisions concerning academic standards if they are \"shown\nto be clearly arbitrary or capricious.\" But as the Supreme Court\nindicated in Board of Curators of the University of Missouri v.\nHorowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 92 (1978), courts \"are particularly ill-\nequipped to evaluate [such decisions]\" and this consideration \"warn[s]\nagainst any such judicial intrusion into academic decisionmaking.\"\nHere, the district court never identified precisely why it would\n\n- 35 -\nbe arbitrary or capricious for a state to give college students\na 12th grade level test on basic skills without advance notice,\nparticularly since the state gives those students an unlimited\nopportunity to retake the test. After all, the purpose of this\ntest is to determine whether college students possess basic skills\nat the high school level.\nIn any event, the legislation passed in 1981 expressly\nprovided that students seeking admission into teacher education\nprograms would have to pass a test on \"basic skills\" (Texas Educa-\ntion Code, Section 13.032). In January 1982, the State Board\npublished a rule specifying that this requirement would take effect\non May 1, 1984 and sent copies of the rule to all colleges and\nuniversities (Veselka Dep. 18, 96). In the same year, the State\nBoard required all colleges and universities to include notice of\nthe testing requirement in their catalogues (Tr. 1163). Thus,\neven assuming the Due Process Clause required some kind of notice\nof the testing requirement, the State fulfilled this requirement.\nMoreover, in the spring of 1983, the State Board sent a\npamphlet to all college students notifying them of the testing\nrequirement (id. at 95-96; Deft. Ex. 10). That pamphlet explained\nthat the test would cover basic skills in reading, writing and\narithmetic, and gave descriptions of the content that would be\ncovered on each section (Deft. Ex. 10). It also informed students\nto contact their local institutions or the Texas Education Agency\nfor additional information about the test (ibid.).(cid:9) While we\ndo not believe these additional steps were required, they surely\nrefute any possible suggestion that the State failed to provide\nappellees with adequate notice.\n\n- 36 -\nThe district court apparently believed that the State\nshould have given students additional preparation materials, such as\nskill \nsample test questions and a more detailed list of the  areas\n5/\ncovered by the test.(cid:9) obviously, information of this kind would\nhave been helpful. But it would trivialize the Due Process Clause\nto hold that a state is constitutionally precluded from giving\ncollege students a 12th grade level test on basic skills in reading,\nwriting, and arithmetic unless it provides them with sample test\nquestions first.\nIn sum, appellees are unlikely to prevail on their claim\nthat the State's imposition of the PPST requirement violated their\nrights under the Due Process Clause. The district court's contrary\n6/\nholding is based on a misapplication of the governing legal standards.\n5/ The State did supply this kind of material upon request to some\nstudents and many institutions (Tr. 1171; Veselka Dep. 96-98, 100-102;\nDeft. Ex. 11). It did not systematically provide such information\nto all students and all institutions, however (Veselka Dep. 98).\n6/ Appellees also claim that the PPST violates Due Process because\nit tests material they have not been taught. Citing this Court's\ndecision in Debra P. V. Turlington, 644 F.2d 397, 404 (1981), the\ndistrict court held that if the PPST tests skills the State has\nnot taught, its use would violate Due Process (Mem. 38). The\ncourt found, however, that insufficient evidence had been presented\nto decide the likelihood of appellees' prevailing on this factual\nissue. The district court erred in extrapolating from Debra P. a\nuniversal rule that a test covering material not previously taught\nviolates Due Process. Debra P. dealt with a high school graduation\ntest. Nothing in Debra P. suggests that this principle applies\nto tests used for admission into professional schools and ultimately\ninto the profession itself. A state has a legitimate interest in\npreventing those who lack basic skills from becoming teachers.\nThat interest does not disappear simply because the reason particular\nindividuals lack basic skills is that they have not been taught\nthem. It may seem unfair to test students on material they have\nnot been taught. It is more unfair, however, to impose on young\nchildren teachers who lack basic skills. Because the district\ncourt premised its finding of a probable Due Process violation on\nlack of adequate notice and did not reach appellees' alternative\nDue Process claim, this Court need not decide this issue now.\n\n- 37 -\nC. The district court erred in holding that appellees were likely\nto prevail on their Title VI claim\nThe district court held that appellees were also likely to\nprevail on their claim under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d), which prohibits discrimination in federally\nassisted programs. The district court premised this holding entirely\non its previous conclusion that appellees were likely to prevail\non their claim that the State's use of the PPST was motivated by\ndiscriminatory intent in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\nAs we have discussed, the district court's finding on intent\nis based on an improper legal standard and is clearly erroneous.\nSince the court's analysis under Title VI simply tracks its\nanalysis under the Equal Protection Clause, it suffers from precisely\n7/\nthe same errors.\n7/Appellees claim that the State's use of the PPST also violates\na Title VI regulation that prohibits a recipient of federal\nfinancial assistance from using \"criteria or methods of\nadministration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to\ndiscrimination * * *.\" 34 C.E.R. 100.3(b)(2). Because the district\ncourt refrained from addressing whether appellees were likely\nto prevail on this claim, that issue is not before this Court\non this appeal.\n\n- 38 -\nD. The district court erred in holding that appellees were\nlikely to prevail on their claim under the Equal Educational\nOpportunity Act\nThe district court held (Mem. 45-47) that there is a\nsubstantial likelihood that appellees will prevail on their\nclaim that the PPST violates the Equal Educational Opportunities\nAct of 1974 (EEOA). Specifically, the court relied upon the\nsection which provides that no State shall deny equal educational\nopportunity by its failure to \"take affirmative steps * * * to\nremove the vestiges of a dual school system\" (20 U.S.C. 1703(b)).\nTaking \"judicial notice of its own findings regarding the nature\nof the Texas school systems over the years * * *\" (Mem. 46), the\ncourt reasoned that many students now seeking to become teachers\nmust have received some years of their education in imperfectly-\ndesegregated schools. It follows, the court held, that the\ndisproportionate failure rate was, itself, a vestige of past\ndiscrimination. This analysis is fundamentally flawed for several\nreasons.\nFirst, the EEOA does not impose any obligations upon higher\neducation systems or authorities. It is limited in effect to\nthe activities of state and local educational agencies at the\nelementary and secondary levels. See 20 U.S.C. 1720(a) and\n(b); 20 U.S.C. 881(f) and (k). Accordingly, the EEOA imposes\nno obligations, remedial or otherwise on the higher education\nsystem in Texas. Acceptance of the District Court's holding\nwould constitute an unwarranted extension of the Debra P. rule\n\n- 39 -\nto govern admission to systems of higher education which receive\nsome or most of their students from non-unitary systems. Such\nan extension of Debra P. conflicts with basic principles of\nfederal remedial authority and Equal Protection analysis.\nHigher education systems, even in formerly de jure states,\nhave no constitutional or statutory obligation to suspend or\nlower perfectly valid academic standards to accommodate high\nschool students who may be ill-prepared because of prior con-\nstitutional violations by local and elementary school systems.\nAs previously noted, the Supreme Court cases delineating the\nfundamental limitations on federal remedial authority in\ndesegregation cases make clear that imposing such an obligation\non a higher education system would be impermissible because\nthe scope of such remedies necessarily exceeds the \"nature\nand extent of the violation,\" General Building Contractors\nAssn., supra, 458 U.S. at 399. Accord, Swann, supra, 402 U.S.\nat 22-23; Pasadena Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 436\n(1976); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 746-747 (1974)\n(Milliken I). The higher education entities in this case\ncannot be required to correct discrimination by other entities\nin Texas any more than the suburban school districts in Milliken\nI could be required to correct Detroit's segregative practices.\nTo conclude otherwise would mean that a state that once practiced\nschool segregation may not set minimum standards for any trade\nthat involves state licensing -- even those not related to\n\n- 40 -\neducation -- e.g., barbers and plumbers. All standard-setting,\nby this reckoning, superimposes penalties on the victims of\npast discrimination.\nMoreover, wholly apart from the question of whether\nfederal courts can require such \"remedial\" action, we submit\nthat a prohibition against otherwise valid academic standards\nin this context does not, in any meaningful way, counteract the\neffects of past segregation -- indeed such a rule will serve to\nperpetuate such effects. No one disputes the unfortunate fact\nthat past racial discrimination in public schools (and other\nareas) has adversely affected the educational achievement levels\nof minority students in formerly segregated (and other) schools.\nBut it clearly makes no sense, from a constitutional perspective,\nto \"solve\" that problem by enjoining or fundamentally altering\notherwise valuable academic programs that serve an essential\neducational function. It is difficult to conceive of what\n\"advantage\" is secured to the purported beneficiaries of a\ndoctrine which prohibits universities from applying to them the\nsame valid academic standards imposed on their colleagues. It\nis only a most otiose -- if not perverse -- notion of equality\nthat prevents such neutral inquiry into whether students possess\nthe basic school skills required of others in the professions\nthey seek to enter. Any educational deficiencies suffered by\nminority students in elementary and secondary schools are not\ncorrected by such a scheme, they are simply enshrined in\n\nmow\nperpetuity. In short, adoption of such a doctrine would be to\n\"celebrate and perpetuate the hollow certification that accom-\npanied black graduation pre-Brown [v. Board of Education, 347\nU.S. 483 (1954)].\" Debra P. V. Turlington, 654 F.2d 1079, 1085\n(5th Cir. 1981) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from denial of rehear-\ning en banc).\nBut even assuming the would-be teachers benefit from not\nbeing held to generally applicable academic requirements, such\na rule surely will have no such beneficial effect on their\nfuture students. The state is surely not required to impose on\nfuture generations the stunting effects of past discrimination.\nPermitting people to teach who themselves lack basic skills\nwould do exactly that. Moreover, far from supplying students\nwith genuine \"minority role models,\" disallowing an examination\nof whether minority teachers possess basic skills can only have\na stigmatizing effect on them and a deleterious effect on those\nwhom they teach. It is presumably for this reason that this\nCourt has permitted school districts that are in the process of\ndesegregating to utilize examinations among the objective and\nnonracial criteria for hiring, promotion, and demotion of\nteachers. 8/ Thus, the state's effort to upgrade its certified\n8/ See, e.g., Moore v. Tangipohoa Parish School Board, 594\nF.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1979); Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Educ.\n(Sumter County), 463 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1972). Of course,\nwhere the test is being used as one instrumentality of demons-\ntrable racially discriminatory purpose, the court did not\npermit it. See, e.g., Baker v. Columbus Municipal Separate\nSchool District, 462 F.2d 1112 (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n- 42 -\nteachers is a legitimate measure to correct the effects of all\nthose past practices that may have depressed the level of\nscholastic achievement in Texas.\nMoreover, there is an additional reason why application\nof the Debra P. rule is inappropriate here. State action can\nonly violate the EEOA if it directly affects some facet of\nelementary or secondary education. The student's \"expectation\"\nof a diploma may make the diploma an intrinsic perquisite or\nterm and condition of secondary education. But entrance to a\nprofessional school is not part of the normal expectation of\nall students who complete a high school curriculum. on the\ncontrary, one would think it assumed that not every high school\ngraduate is qualified to become a teacher. Nor is it part of\nthe implicit bargain between the state and its young people\nthat completion of high school will render all of them qualified\nto enter any particular trade or institution of higher learning.\nIn any event, Debra P. would be inapposite even if it\napplied. There is no evidence in the record of this case that\nwould support a finding that there has been widespread segre-\ngation in Texas' elementary and secondary schools in the past\ndecade. The first order in this case was entered in 1971, and\nthere is no basis for saying that there has been significant\nnoncompliance with that order.\n\n- 43 -\nFinally, the court failed to take account of the evidence\nshowing that the PPST is, in fact, serving a remedial purpose.\nThe record reflects that there is ample provision for remedial\neducation in the state's junior and community colleges. The\ndistrict court itself found, moreover, that the students who\nfailed the PPST have not given up, and have worked to improve\ntheir skills so that the proportion of those passing has greatly\nincreased in the last year (Mem. 21, n. 15; Tr. 1516).\nCONCLUSION\nThe district court's decision should be reversed and the\ncase should be remanded with directions to dismiss appellees'\nmotion for lack of jurisdiction. In the alternative, the\ndistrict court's decision should be reversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nWM ._J AD rs DLaZ(cid:9) DS\nAssistant Attorney General\nBRIAN K.

It may well be that the concurring judge in the court\nof appeals was correct in suggesting that the appellate\ncourt should have considered the issue of intervention by\nthe United States before proceeding to determine whether\nthe district court had jurisdiction over the case (Pet. App.\n42). Any error, however, is not of a nature which warrants\nreview by this Court, since it would not affect the\njudgment. As the concurring opinion correctly noted (Pet.\nApp. 42), post-judgment intervention for the purpose of\nappealing is proper where the initial party has declined to\nappeal so long as intervention is sought promptly after the\nentry of final judgment.

Nesbit, 203 F. 2d\n463 (9th Cir. 1953).8\n'Petitioners' argument that they should not be required to travel to\na more distant forum ignores the fact that if TEA's actions had been\ntaken solely under state law, review could be had only in a state court\nlocated in the county where TEA is located, i.e., Travis County,\nTexas.

The provi-\nsions of the State of Texas order are thus consistent with centralized\nreview under state law.\n\"Although the court of appeals did not address the issue whether\nthe United States had the requisite interest to enable it to intervene,\nthe fact that the order which it had obtained in the State of Texas suit\nwas being collaterally attacked supplies that interest.\nDOJ-1979-02",
