Docket entries from 1997 and beyond are filed electronically. \nWhere the Court cites a docket entry as “Doc. No. XX,” it refers to the electronic docket unless otherwise stated. \n \n3  See the Joint Motion at 1-3 for a review in greater depth of the various modifications of the original Order since \n  1970. \n \n4  The Court notes that there are minor variations between the numbers, by race, of students enrolled in TISD’s \n  various schools between the summary charts in the Joint Motion and in the most recent Compliance Report filed \nApril 14, 2016 (Doc. No. 62). However, the variations are within the range one might expect over a four-month \nperiod and are not material. \n \n5  In the case of new school construction or modification of an existing school to incorporate students from other \n  schools, TISD has accompanied its proposals for facilities construction or modification with an incorporated proposal \nfor modification of the pertinent attendance zones. See, e.g., the Agreed Order Modifying Plan of Desegregation and \nApproving New Attendance Zones for Rice/Owens/Jack Campuses (Doc. No. 27) issued by Judge Ward on April 2, \n2007. There, TISD and the United States submitted an agreed, joint, plan to modify the attendance zones for Rice, \nOwens and Jack elementary schools concurrent with the completion of Jack elementary school as the relief campus \nfor Rice and Owens elementary schools. The plan included specific consideration of the effect of the modified \nattendance zones on the desegregation effort overall. The attendance zones were put into effect, as also reflected in \nTISD’s Compliance Reports (see, e.g., Compliance Report dated April 14, 2016, at PageID #6886, reflecting the Rice, \nOwens & Jack Elementary Schools Attendance Zones, worked out jointly between TISD and the DOJ. These \nattendance  zones  are  also  described  on  TISD’s  website,  available  at \nhttp://tylerisd.schoolfusion.us/modules/cms/pages.phtml?pageid=224088  (providing  attendance  zone  charts  for \nTISD’s elementary, middle and high schools).).
