While the Court’s previous ruling and the original desegregation decree \nfocused on African–American students, the Court cannot ignore the significant minority Hispanic population and the \ndiversity brought about by including those and other minority students. \n \n8  In conducting its analysis, the Court used the DWS applications from students who actually attended Farmerville \n  Elementary School last year because it is unclear whether students zoned for kindergarten at Farmerville Elementary \nSchool will actually attend. A cursory review of the applications reveals a number of students who might otherwise \nattend Farmerville Elementary School or other Union schools currently attend private school, are home-schooled, or \nattend school out of Union Parish. \n \n9  Other Union schools, such as Marion and Downsville High Schools, will also lose white students, but there is less \n  likely to be a significant effect on the demographics at those schools. \n \n  7 \n \n\n \n10  DWS  filed  one  pleading  that  contained  both  its  Second  Motion  to  Intervene  and  its  Second  Motion  for \n  Authorization. As set forth above, the Court has already granted DWS leave to intervene, but deferred ruling on the \nremainder of the motion until a hearing could be held. The Court now grants the remainder of the motion seeking \nauthorization for operation of a charter school in Union Parish. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  8 \n ",

While evidence shows that students have left Union to attend other schools, \nthere is no evidence that they have actually changed their parish of residence. \n \n4  The slight variation in figures may be explained by the greater than average number of residents in Union Parish \n  over the age of 65. http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22111.html. Union Parish was recently selected as a \nLouisiana certified retirement community. See Jacobi, Keli, The News Star, “Union Parish to receive designation as \nCertified Retirement Community,” July 9, 2008. \n \n5  Defendants admitted in discovery that Union is the public body of the State of Louisiana charged with the duty of \n  administering the schools in Union Parish. \n \n6  Defendants argued that one parent had no standing and obtained an affidavit from another parent in winch she \n  attested that she did not consent to the filing of the lawsuit. \n \n7  Prior to the hearing, the Court allowed additional parents of African–American children in Union Parish to intervene. \n \n \n8  Singleton was vacated in part by the Supreme Court in Carter v. West Feliciana Par. Sch. Bd., 396 U.S. 226, 228, 90 \n  S.Ct. 467, 24 L.Ed.2d 382 (1969), but only to the extent that the Fifth Circuit deferred desegregation of schools until \n  11 \n \n\n \nthe 1970–71 school year. \n \n9  Rocky Branch was a 1–6 facility at this time. \n \n \n10  The fact that no review was requested is not unusual when the case was filed by individual plaintiffs, rather than the \n  United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). \n \n11  There were no black students, and 3 students of other races. \n \n \n12  At the time of the closures, Linville had a 30% greater white student population and Lillie had a 6% greater black \n  population than contemplated by the February 11, 1970 Decree. \n \n13  Testimony at the hearing indicated that the 2004 figure included students who evacuated to North Louisiana \n  following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, those hurricanes occurred in 2005. Regardless, the 2004 figure is an \nanomaly from the otherwise consistent decline in students. \n \n14  The race of other students in Union Parish is predominantly Hispanic with a small percentage of Asian students and \n  one Native American. \n \n15  Although  neither  Union  nor  DWS  can  be  certain  of  the  enrollment  figures  and  racial  composition  of \n  students/potential students for the upcoming school year, the Court believes that it has been provided the most \naccurate information possible under the circumstances. \n \n16  La.Rev.Stat. 17:3983A(2)(a)(i) (“Each proposal for a Type 1 ... charter school shall first be made to the local school \n  board with jurisdiction where the school is to be located ... If, after review ... the local school board denies the \nproposal, or if conditions placed on the proposal by the local school board ... are not acceptable to those proposing \nthe charter, then a proposal for a Type 2 charter school may be made to the State Board of Elementary and \nSecondary Education.”). \n \n17  DWS went through the application and evaluation process two times, for the 2007–2008 school year and for the \n  current 2008–2009 school year. Both times, DWS was evaluated by an outside consulting firm hired by the State and \nwas recommended for approval. BESE denied DWS’s application for the 2007–2008 school year. Prior to BESE’s vote \nthe second time, Representative Mike Walsworth introduced a resolution in the House, and Senator Robert Barham \nintroduced a resolution in the Senate, both urging BESE to approve DWS’s application. [Exhibit 31]. BESE approved \nDWS’s application for the current school year. \n  12 \n \n\n \n \n18  Presumably, this student would be attending school at Marion. \n \n \n19  The parties dispute whether the Court should consider all the kindergarten students a loss to Union, but, in either \n  case, the loss to Union is substantial. \n \n20  With the DWS prospective students, the score was 66.1. \n \n \n21  The Court notes that it appreciates the efforts of DWS and its counsel to comply with both the requirements of state \n  law and, in its view, of federal desegregation law by seeking review prior to opening its doors. \n \n22  Although Union and DWS have discussed the number of “at risk” students which may attend DWS, both agree that \n  the issue of the “at risk” population is one of state law, see La.Rev.Stat. 17:3991B, and that the number of “at risk” \nstudents cannot serve as a substitute for race. Thus, the number of “at risk” students to be enrolled at DWS is \nirrelevant to the Court’s review. \n \n23  In discharging this duty, the district court considers the Supreme Court’s “Green factors”: (1) faculty and staff \n  assignments;  (2)  transportation;  (3)  extra-curricular  activities;  (4)  facilities;  (5)  student  assignments;  and  (6) \ncurriculum. Green, 391 U.S. at 435, 88 S.Ct. 1689. \n \n24  The undersigned is familiar with both the geography and racial history of Union Parish, having been reared in \n  Farmerville and having attended Union schools. \n \n25  DWS’s purchase of land near Crossroads does not alleviate this concern. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  13 \n ",

In  *1338 \nsubstantially reflect the racial composition of the total \nVermilion Parish, for example, 44 percent of all Negro \nnumber of teachers in the system. The rule should not be \nstudents attend former white schools.20 But it can hardly \ninflexible.

The following tables show the extent \nregard to race. As this Court has held in other cases, race \nof  student  and  faculty  desegregation  as  of \nmay be considered when it is necessary in fashioning a \nSeptember-October of 1968: \n   remedy  to  undo  past  unconstitutional  discrimination.21 \nThe purpose is not to achieve racial balance as an end in \nI  am  not  suggesting  that  freedom  of  choice  should \nitself but to use it as a means of ending the dual system \nnecessarily be abandoned in favor of zoning. In some \nbased on segregated faculties in segregated schools. As \nareas,  because  of  residential  patterns  based  on  race, \nthe Seventh Circuit recently pointed out in a decision \ncourt-approved school zoning would legalize the Southern \nupholding a district court’s order requiring bussing of \nequivalent  of  Northern  de facto  segregation.  In  many \nchildren from one Chicago school to another, ‘This is not \nschool districts freedom of choice has not worked because \ndone to achieve racial balance, although that may be the \nschool boards have thought that they complied with the \nresult, but to counteract the legacy left by the Board’s \nlaw simply by opening the doors of white schools to \nhistory of discrimination.’ United States v.

Race or color shall not be a factor in the hiring, assignment, reassignment, \npromotion, demotion, or dismissal of teachers and other professional staff members, including student teachers, \nexcept that race may be taken into account for the purpose of counteracting or correcting the effect of the \nsegregated assignment of faculty and staff in the dual system. Teachers, principals, and staff members shall be \nassigned to schools so that the faculty and staff is not composed exclusively of members of one race. Wherever \npossible, teachers shall be assigned so that more than one teacher of the minority race (white or Negro) shall be on \na desegregated faculty. Defendants shall take positive and affirmative steps to accomplish the desegregation of their \nschool faculties to achieve substantial desegregation of faculties in as many of the schools as possible for the \n1967-68 school year notwithstanding that teacher contracts for the 1967-68 or 1968-69 school years may have \nalready been signed and approved. The tenure of teachers in the system shall not be used as an excuse for failure to \ncomply with this provision. The defendants shall establish as an objective that the pattern of teacher assignment to \nany particular school not be identifiable as tailored for a heavy concentration of either Negro or white pupils in the \nschool. * * * Section VIII(c) Past Assignments. The defendants shall take steps to assign and reassign teachers and \nother professional staff members to climinate the effects of the dual school system. (Emphasis added.) \n \n8  Adams, 403 F.2d 188, (No. 26,501, August 20, 1968): \n \nThe court should make findings of fact and state conclusions of law (in each case) as to (1) whether the school \nboard’s existing plan of desegregation is adequate ‘to convert (the dual system) to a unitary system in which racial \ndiscrimination would be eliminated root and branch’ and (2) whether the proposed changes will result in a \ndesegregation plan to ‘promises realistically to work now’. An effective plan should produce integration of faculties, \nstaff, facilities, transportation, and school activities (such as athletics) along with integration of students. * * * \nIf in a school district there are still all-Negro schools, or only a small fraction of Negroes enrolled in white schools, or \nno substantial integration of faculties and school activities then, as a matter of law, the existing plan fails to meet \nconstitutional standards as established in Green. Boards in such districts are under a duty to take affirmative action \ntoward effective desegregation before the start of the 1968-69 school year or as soon as practicable after the \ncommencement of that year. One alternative to freedom of choice is the assignment of students on the basis of \ngeographic attendance zones. In an attendance zone system (as in a freedom-of-choice  system), the school \nauthorities should consider the consolidation of certain schools, pairing of schools, and a majority-to-minority \ntransfer policy as means to the end of disestablishing the dual system. * * * Should the district court in a particular \ncase conclude that the existing freedom-of-choice plan is not working, but that it is not administratively feasible for \nthe board to shift immediately to other alternatives, the court should require the board (1) to take forthwith such \nsteps toward full desegregation as may be practicable in the first and second semesters of the 1968-69 school year, \nand (2) to formulate and submit to the court, by November 28, 1968, a plan to complete the full conversion of the \nschool district to a unitary, non-racial system for * * *1969-70; * * * The district court should enter an order by such \ndate as will permit effective review in this Court, if review is necessary, of the court-approved actions the Board will \ninstitute in the 1968-69 year as well as the 1969-70 year. * * * \n \n9  The hearing was held on November 12, 1968, with the approval of this Court. The Chief Judge of the Western \n  District, with commendable celerity, after Green and before Adams, had called a hearing en banc to determine the \neffect of that of Green on school desegregation plans in the Western District of Louisiana. \n \n10  Green, 391 U.S. at 438, 88 S.Ct. at 1694, 20 L.Ed.2d at 724.
