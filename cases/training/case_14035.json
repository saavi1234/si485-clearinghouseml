That error has been cured and by this \namended Motion, attached are properly notarized affidavits, identified as Exhibits A-K.  Further, \nPlaintiffs adopt all other allegations and supporting documents, set forth in their original Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining Order filed on September 9, 2005. \nRELIEF SOUGHT \nPursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs in this long-\nstanding school desegregation case move this Court to immediately issue an ex parte Temporary \nRestraining Order ( \"TRO\") against the Defendant Western Line Consolidated School District \n(\"Western Line\" or \"Defendant\") to the following ends: \n(a)  requiring Western Line to immediately cease implementation and \nexecution of an unauthorized student assignment plan that requires \n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 2 of 11 PageID #: 62\nkindergarten students from the Glen Allan Elementary School and the \nRiverside Elementary School to attend classes at the former C.L. Morris \nschool facility, which Plaintiffs submit is unsafe; \n(b)  requiring Western Line to develop and submit to the Plaintiffs and the \nCourt, prior to the expiration of the TRO, both short-term and long-term \nplans for using alternative sites (other than the C.L. Morris facility) for \neducating kindergarten students previously scheduled to attend classes at \nGlen Allan Elementary and Riverside Elementary School, as well as short \nterm and long-term plans for former Glen Allan Elementary students in \ngrades one (1) through six (6), now housed at Riverside Elementary \nSchool; \nÂ©  requiring Western Line to respond in full to Plaintiffs informal discovery \nrequest (dated March 10, 2005) prior to the expiration of the TRO; \n(d)  enjoining Western Line from engaging in any type of retaliatory action \nagainst kindergarten students or the parents who withhold their children \nfrom school due to unsafe conditions at the C.L. Morris facility.  Such \nretaliatory acts may include, but are not limited to, negative grading of \nmissed assignments, removal of privileges, truancy enforcement during \npendency of this litigation, and negative employment action for parents or \nother relatives of affected students who may be employed by Western \nLine; \n(e)  compelling Western Line to commission independent inspections of the \nC.L. Morris facility by all relevant state and local agencies (including, but \nnot limited to the Mississippi Department of Education, the Mississippi \nCommission on Environmental Quality and the Mississippi Department of \nHealth) for various health hazards (including, but not limited to the \nfollowing: asbestos abatement; lead abatement; mold and mildew removal; \ndrinking water quality; pest and rodent infestation; structural soundness of \nfacility) and to provide the results and documentation of such inspections \nto the Plaintiffs; and \n(f)  compelling Western Line to provide compensatory educational services \nand ample opportunity to make up missed school work for those students \nwho were unable to attend classes due to unsafe conditions at the C.L. \nMorris facility. \n-2-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 3 of 11 PageID #: 63\nGROUNDS FOR MOTION \nThe grounds for this motion, as set forth more fully in the affidavits of Marlene Davis, \nShatawna Riley, Dessoree Smith, Quenshoda Henry, LaShay Ball, Ivory Brady and Veronica \nWalker (herein identified as Exhibits A-G) contain several points of information, including much \nof the following, which Plaintiffs allege on information and belief.  Also attached, herein \nidentified as Exhibits H-K, are affidavits of the following individuals:  Lillie B. Ayers, Andrew \nB. Gatson, Janice Young and Sheila Brady, who are local community residents and family \nmembers of the Plaintiffs in support of the relief requested by this Motion. \n1.  Western Line has implemented a new student assignment plan without consulting \nopposing counsel or the Court.  This assignment plan requires kindergarten students from both \nthe Glen Allan and Riverside Schools to attend classes at the former C.L. Morris facility, and \nrequires students in grades one (1) through six (6) at Glen Allan to attend classes at the Riverside \nElementary School.  This reassignment plan was apparently devised in response to a fire that \ndamaged a part of the Glen Allan Elementary School building on the morning of August 30, \n2005.  The fire and resulting damage are still under investigation by the Washington County \nSheriffs Department, which is treating Glen Allan Elementary School as a crime scene. \n2.  Prior to the fire, Western Line had sought to close the predominately African-\nAmerican Glen Allan Elementary School altogether and the matter was the subject of potential \nlitigation.  However, Western Line has failed to respond, even in part, to an informal discovery \nrequest submitted by Plaintiffs regarding this matter nearly six (6) months ago. \n3.  Western Line did not provide formal notice of the student reassingment plan or its \ndetails to parents of affected students in the Glen Allan community.  The only notice came from a \n-3-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 4 of 11 PageID #: 64\nWestern Line school board meeting, held on Thursday, September 1, 2005, during which the \nschool board went into executive session and summarily announced its plan to the audience upon \nreconvening in public session, eliminating any opportunity for meaningful input and comment \nfrom the public.  However, Western Line did provide notice via letter to parents of kindergartners \nschedule to attend the predominately white Riverside Elementary School. \n4.  Western Line did not endeavor to provide any form of notice to Plaintiffs' counsel \nabout either the fire or the reassignment plan until nearly two weeks later - conveniently, after \nthe reassignment plan had already been implemented and classes begun - and even then, only \nafter Plaintiffs' counsel contacted Western Line's counsel to protest the lack of notice request \ndetailed information.  As of this writing, Western Line has not provided information regarding \nthe logistics of classroom instruction at either the Riverside Elementary School or the C.L. \nMorris facility.  Some parents have reported that Glen Allan students may be segregated from the \npopulation of Riverside students. \n5.  Western Line did not seek court approval for its reassignment plan, thereby \ndeviating from the spirit, if not the letter, of this Court's previous school desegregation orders, \nparticularly with respect to student assignment and attendance zone boundaries. \n6.  The C.L. Morris facility is located on Highway 1 in Avon, MS.  It consists of two \nmain buildings, neither of which have been used as instructional space in several years.  The last \ntime the facility housed students was in 1999 when junior high school students were temporarily \nhoused there.  Even then, plaintiff class members report, the building was in such disrepair that \nrain water poured in through the ceiling.  Currently, least part of the C.L. Morris facility appears \nto have been abandoned, posing a variety of health and safety hazards.  See item 9, infra. \n-4-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 5 of 11 PageID #: 65\n7.  Parents of affected students from Glen Allan (members of the Plaintiff class) \ninitiated peaceful and professional contact with Western Line Superintendent Larry Green in an \nattempt to obtain verification and documentation regarding the safety ofthe C.L. Morris facility. \nAmong other things, they inquired about the following: asbestos abatement status, lead \ncontamination status, mold and mildew removal, drinking water quality tests, pest and rodent \ninfestation and control status, structural soundness of facility.  These concerns are shared by \nmany in the community, as evidence by petitions annexed to this pleading.  See Exhibit L, which \nis a composite Exhibit of copies of petitions containing signatures of Glen Allan and Riverside \nparents and other concerned citizens.  Superintendent Green did not provide such documentation \nand admitted that the C.L. Morris facility had, in fact, not been inspected by any agency prior to \nthe start of classes.  To the Plaintiffs' knowledge it still has not been inspected as of this writing. \n8.  Despite the lack of prior health and safety inspection, Western Line officials \ninitially refused to allow parents of African-American Glen Allan kindergartners to visually \ninspect the C.L. Morris facility prior to dropping their children off for classes.  However, white \nparents were permitted open access to the facility. \n9.  After negotiation between parents and Superintendent Larry Green, the parents \nwere permitted to inspect the facility, but only in small groups and even then under armed police \nescort. \n10.  Upon their visual inspection ofthe C.L. Morris facility, parents observed \ndeplorable conditions that make the facility wholly unsafe and inappropriate for any students, let \nalone those of tender years.  These observations included the following: \n- large rodent droppings \n- numerous dark stains on many ceiling tiles, with possible mold/mildew spores \n-5-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 6 of 11 PageID #: 66\n- large amounts of dust and dirt in common areas \n-inappropriate delivery of meals imported from another site \n-the strong aroma of paint fumes \n- a general stale aroma throughout the facility \n-numerous workers engaging in construction work on premises during classes \n- lack of fire extinguishers in designated locations \n- lack of hot water in restrooms \n- general unsanitary conditions in restrooms \n- lack of doors for restroom stalls \n- lack of soap and hand-drying materials in restrooms \n-toilets of an inappropriately large size for young kindergartners, such that they \ncould fall into commodes \n- spraying of pesticides on the premises while students were in classrooms and \nwhile meals were being delivered \nSee Exhibit M-T (Photographs of C.L. Morris facility) and Exhibit U (news article from the \nDelta Democrat) 1â¢  One building on the premises has received a cosmetic paint job and new \ncarpeting over dirty floors.  The other building located less than twenty (20) feet away, serves as \nan abandoned warehouse, still containing large amounts of old, broken, dusty and mildewed \nbooks and desks; broken light bulbs, school supplies, crumbling construction materials, and \nmaintenance equipment on the floor; and an inoperable commode sitting in the middle of one \nroom - all of which are strewn about the premises as if a tornado had touched down.  According \nto one construction worker on the site, this building is also inhabited by numerous snakes. \n11.  Western Line does not appear to have seriously considered alternative sites or \narrangements for educating the affected students. \n12.  Several parents of kindergarten students, including students with health conditions \nthat include asthma, have opted to withhold their children from classes at the C.L. Morris facility \ndue to safety concerns.  Thus, their ability to obtain an education, and their fundamental right to a \n1Recent video footage of these conditions is also available should the Court desire to view \nit. \n-6-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 7 of 11 PageID #: 67\nminimally adequate education under Mississippi law, have been directly compromised due to \nWestern Line's failure to provide a verifiably safe learning environment.  These parents are \nfearful of retaliation by Western Line against themselves and their minor children for their \ndecision to vindicate their rights. \n13.  Unless enjoined, Western Line will continue to implement its student \nreassignment plan, deprive the Plaintiff class of vital safety information, and place very young \nchildren at grave risk of serious injury and deleterious health consequences.  There is a \nsubstantial likelihood that these health hazards will cause immediate and irreparable harm to the \nstudents and their parents, members of the Plaintiff class in the instant case.  The conditions at \nthe C.L. Morris facility are at best unverifiable.  Thus, Western Line cannot argue that the facility \nis safe with any degree of certainty.  Considering the substances and conditions that currently \nexist at the facility, it should be presumed unsafe for habitation by anyone, let alone the youngest \nchildren in the school district  Indeed, Plaintiffs submit that if this facility were an apartment \nbuilding, it would surely violate the warranty of habitability, leading to a constructive eviction. \n14.  Plaintiffs' counsel attempted to contact DavidS. Rounsavall, counsel for \nDefendant Western Line, on the first day of classes on which the affected students were \ninstructed to report to the C.L. Morris facility- Wednesday, September 7, 2005.  An assistant \nreported that Mr. Rounsavall was in the office, but on another telephone line, so Plaintiffs' \ncounsel left a message with the assistant, providing a mobile telephone number for easy contact. \nOn the afternoon of Thursday, September 8, 2005, Mr. Rounsavallleft a voicemail message and \nan E-mail message for Plaintiffs' counsel indicating that he would be out of town for the \nremainder of that afternoon and for the balance of the business week ending September 9, 2005. \n-7-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 8 of 11 PageID #: 68\nIt was also in that E-mail message that Western Line provided its first tardy notice of even the \nfire that damaged the Glen Allan School. \n15.  The irreparable harm will occur prior to the time opposing counsel may be \nprepared to be heard in this matter.  Counsel for Defendant has indicated via E-mail message that \nhe will be out of town for the balance of the business week ending September 9, 2005.  Thus, \nwaiting for counsel places the students at risk of either exposure to health hazards or exposure to \nclaims of truancy or failure to comply with the state's compulsory school attendance law.  Thus, \nimmediate action by the Court is necessary to protect both the students' health and other \ninterests. \n16.  No significant injury will be sustained by Western Line or the public through \nissuance ofthe requested TRO.  It appears that Western Line has not meaningfully explored other \nalternatives, some of which may even be more cost-effective and efficient, as well as more \nbeneficial to students overall.2  Even if injury could be claimed from issuance ofthe TRO, it \nwould be significantly outweighed by the threat of harm to befall the young children in Western \nLine's care.  See Cherokee Pump & Equipment. Inc. v. Aurora Pump, 38 F.3d 246,249 (5th \nCir.1994). \nSUMMARY \nThe  children  of the  Western  Line  School  District  deserve  to  have  a  safe  learning \nenvironment. It was unconscionable for the Defendant to assign students to attend classes at an old, \nabandoned facility without first inspecting it for health and safety hazards.  It is even worse to \n2These options include temporarily educating students at a more suitable facility, such as \nprivately-owned buildings or other school facilities that are currently in use. \n-8-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 9 of 11 PageID #: 69\npermit students to inhabit the facility with clear and grave dangers all around the campus.  Safety \nshould be of paramount concern.  Courts have recognized that \"an injury is 'irreparable' only if it \ncannot be undone through monetary remedies.\"  Deerfield Medical Center v. City of Deerfield \nBeach, 661 F.2d 328,338 (5th Cir. 1981).  It should go without saying that no amount of money can \ncompensate for a severe injury or health threat to a child.  Cf.  Steven L. LaFrance Pharmacy. Inc. \nv. Tallant, 1997 WL 392736 (N.D. Miss. June 25, 1997), at *6. \nThus, the facility must be thoroughly inspected by the appropriate agencies and the Plaintiff \nclass  should be furnished with verification and documentation of the aforementioned safety \ninspections.  In the meanwhile, all students must be removed from the facility in order to preserve \ntheir good health.  In addition, steps must be taken to protect these students and their families from \nretaliation, as well as to provide compensatory education services where necessary. \nSafety cannot wait upon the schedules of the Defendant parties.  And the school district's \nleadership has already demonstrated that its discretion cannot be trusted when it concerns the health \nand safety of students.  If left to their own devices, Western Line may never provide the necessary \ninspections and documentation.  For these reasons, Court action is both necessary and particularly \nappropriate. \n-9-\n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 10 of 11 PageID #: 70\nCONCLUSION \nThis motion is based upon the aforementioned allegations made on information and belief, \nthe Points and Authorities3 specified herein, the annexed and supporting Affidavits, as well as the \nother Exhibits to this pleading and other evidence that may be presented at a hearing. \nWHEREFORE, Upon consideration ofthis evidence, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \nCourt issue a TRO to the ends specified in this Motion, to remain in effect for the maximum time \nperiod permissible under Rule 65, or until the Court may schedule and hold a hearing on this matter. \nRespectfully Submitted this~ day of September, 2005. \nOF COUNSEL: \nSANDRA JARIBU HILL \nAttorney at Law \nMississippi Workers' Center for Human Rights \n213 Main Street \nGreenville, MS 38701 \nTelephone: 662-334-1122 \nFacsimile:  662-334-1274 \n3Pursuant to Rules 7.2(D) and (H) ofthe Local Rules of the Northern District of \nMississippi, Plaintiffs note that the instant motion for a TRO is an urgent, ex parte instrument, \nand therefore request that the Court dispense with the typical requirement of a memorandum of \nauthorities. \n\nCase: 4:66-cv-00001-WAP Doc #: 5 Filed: 09/09/05 11 of 11 PageID #: 71\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI, Sandra Jaribu Hill, hereby certify that a copy of the foregoing PLAINTIFFS' \nMOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER has been served via hand delivery \nand depositing same in the United States mail, first class postage prepaid to the following at his \nususal address: \nDAVID S.

P 7767 \n    \n  \nFootnotes \n  8 \n \n\n \n1  In addition to the school district itself, the school board members, the district superintendent, and principal James \n  Leach were named as defendants. \n \n2  61 F.R.D. 414, 416 (N.D.Miss.1973). \n \n \n3  The court also ordered the parties to confer about appelleesâ claims for back pay and attorneysâ fees. After staying \n  its reinstatement order pending appeal, the court entered a final judgment fixing the amount of back pay and \nattorneysâ fees. 404 F.Supp. 1225 (N.D.Miss.1975). \n \n4  Those orders included, inter alia, the following Singleton provisions: \n \n(a) Effective not later than February 1, 1970, the principals, teachers, teacher-aides and other staff who work \ndirectly with children at a school shall be so assigned that in no case will the racial composition of a staff indicate \nthat a school is intended for Negro students or white students. For the remainder of the 1969-70 school year the \ndistrict shall assign the staff described above so that the ratio of Negro to white teachers in each school, and the \nratio of other staff in each, are substantially the same as each such ratio is to the teachers and other staff, \nrespectively, in the entire school system. \nThe school district shall, to the extent necessary to carry out this desegregation plan, direct members of its staff as a \ncondition of continued employment to accept new assignments. \n(b) Staff members who work directly with children, and professional staff who work on the administrative level will \nbe hired, assigned, promoted, paid, demoted, dismissed, and otherwise treated without regard to race, color, or \nnational origin. \n(c) If there is to be a reduction in the number of principals, teachers, teacher-aides, or other professional staff \nemployed by the school district which will result in a dismissal or demotion or (sic) any such staff members, the staff \nmember to be dismissed or demoted must be selected on the basis of objective and reasonable non-discriminatory \nstandards from among all the staff of the school district. In addition if there is any such dismissal or demotion, no \nstaff vacancy may be filled through recruitment of a person of a race, color, or national origin different from that of \nthe individual dismissed or demoted, until each displaced staff member who is qualified has had an opportunity to \nfill the vacancy and has failed to accept an offer to do so. \nPrior to such a reduction, the school board will develop or require the development of non-racial objective criteria \nto be used in selecting the staff member who is to be dismissed or demoted. These criteria shall be available for \npublic inspection and shall be retained by the school district. The school district also shall record and preserve the \nevaluation of staff members under the criteria. Such evaluation shall be made available upon request to the \ndismissed or demoted employee. \n \n5  The teacher who replaced Givhan was black. \n \n \n  9 \n \n\n6  Superintendent Morris gave his reasons for not rehiring Givhan in a letter to her dated July 23, 1971: \n \n(1) a flat refusal to administer standardized National tests to the pupils in your charge; (2) an announced intention \nnot to cooperate with the administration of the Glen Allan Attendance Center; (3) and an antagonistic and hostile \nattitude to the administration of the Glen Allan Attendance Center demonstrated throughout the school year. \n \n7  Appellants also sought to establish these other bases for the decision not to rehire: (1) that Givhan âdowngradedâ \n  the papers of white students; (2) that she was one of a number of teachers who walked out of a meeting about \ndesegregation in the fall of 1969 and attempted to disrupt it by blowing automobile horns outside the gymnasium; \n(3) that the school district had received a threat by Givhan and other teachers not to return to work when schools \nreopened on a unitary basis in February, 1970; and (4) that Givhan had protected a student during a weapons \nshakedown at Riverside in March, 1970, by concealing a studentâs knife until completion of a search. The evidence \non the first three of these points was inconclusive and the district judge did not clearly err in rejecting or ignoring it. \nGivhan admitted the fourth incident, but the district judge properly rejected that as a justification for her not being \nrehired, as there was no evidence that Leach relied on it in making his recommendation. \n \n8  Apparently all of the Glen Allan administrative and office personnel were white except for Ms. Hodges, the guidance \n  counselor, Givhanâs husband, who became assistant principal around Thanksgiving, 1970, and a Mr. Jackson. Ms. \nGivhan did not consider the roles of Hodges, Mr. Givhan, and Mr. Jackson very significant in the overall context of \nGlen Allanâs administration. It should be noted that Mr. Givhan was rehired as assistant principal after Leachâs \nrecommendation not to rehire Ms. Givhan. \n \n9  Givhanâs complaint apparently was triggered by the replacement of two black teachersâ aides with a white student \n  as ticket-taker. Givhan admitted that the lunchroom manager was black, but was unaware who had authority to \nassign lunchroom personnel. \n \n10  There was testimony, however, that the District Board of Education ordinarily granted requests for a hearing by \n  teachers not rehired. Givhan made no such request, and no hearing was held. \n \n11  There exists, however, a significant distinction for the purpose of applying the clearly erroneous test between \n  findings of subsidiary fact and findings of ultimate fact. See Galena Oaks Corp. v. Scofield, 5 Cir. 1954, 218 F.2d 217, \n219-20. Finding a subsidiary fact involves the determination of an evidentiary or primary fact; finding an ultimate \nfact, on the other hand, âmay involve the very basis on which judgment of fallible evidence is to be made.â \nBaumgartner v. United States, 1944, 322 U.S. 665, 671, 64 S.Ct. 1240, 1244, 88 L.Ed. 1525, 1529. Thus, for example, \na finding of infringement of a patent is a finding of ultimate fact (citation omitted); as is a finding that a gain should \nbe treated as capital rather than ordinary for income tax purposes (citation omitted). With respect to ultimate \nfindings of fact, furthermore, we noted in Industrial Instrument Corp. v. Foxboro Co. (5 Cir.), supra, 307 F.2d (783) at \n786 n. 2: \nWe may reverse free of the clearly erroneous rule where . . . the issue revolves around an ultimate fact as \ndistinguished from subsidiary fact questions . . . . \nAlthough discrimination vel non is essentially a question of fact it is, at the same time, the ultimate issue for \n  10 \n \n\nresolution in this case . . . . As such, a finding of discrimination is a finding of ultimate fact. \nSee also Wade v. Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service, 528 F.2d 508, 516 (5th Cir. 1976) (racial discrimination); \nStepp v. Estelle, 524 F.2d 447, 453 (5th Cir. 1975) (intelligent waiver of counsel); East v. Romine, Incorporated, 518 \nF.2d 332, 338-39 (5th Cir. 1975) (sex discrimination). \n \n12  There is some evidence that Givhan subsequently orally reminded Leach of her complaints in private conversation. \n  This reminder and the list constituted the âunreasonable demandsâ which the court found primarily motivated \nLeach in his recommendation. This finding seems somewhat inconsistent with the courtâs characterization of Givhan \nas a âvocal critic of the districtâs policies and practices.â Perhaps âactiveâ would be a more appropriate adjective \nthan âvocal.â \n \n13  See, e. g., Abbott v. Thetford, 5 Cir., 534 F.2d 1101, (en banc), revâg and adopting dissenting opinion, 529 F.2d 695 \n  (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, â- U.S. ââ, 97 S.Ct. 1598, 51 L.Ed.2d 804 (1977), (interference of Chief Probation \nOfficerâs expression in the form of a lawsuit with his work relationship with agencies sued justified dismissal by \nJuvenile Court Judge); Smith v. United States, 502 F.2d 512, 516, 518-19 (5th Cir. 1974) (the possibility of effect on \npatients of symbolic speech in form of wearing a peace pin constituted substantial interference with duties of \nwearer as staff psychologist at a Veterans Administration hospital). \nAppellants did not expressly defend on the ground that Givhanâs expression substantially interfered with her work \nor with her relationship with Leach, and the district court made no express finding as to substantial interference. \nThe district courtâs finding that Givhanâs complaints were neither constant nor unreasonable might be taken as a \nfinding that there was no substantial interference with her work. As to the finding of reasonableness, the testimony \nwas conflicting, as noted above. There is no real dispute, however, as to whether the complaints were âconstant.â \nAlthough Leach referred to lists of demands, he could cite only Givhanâs occasional complaints about NYC workers, \nintegration of the office staff and administration, and cafeteria personnel. In view of our disposition of the case we \nneed not reach the issue of substantial interference. \n \n14  The loyalty oath and other cases make clear that requirements for public employment or public office cannot \n  infringe on First Amendment rights to freedom of religion, association, and speech. See, e. g., United States v. Robel, \n389 U.S. 258, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508 (1967) (prohibition of defense employment due to membership in the \nCommunist Party); Whitehill v. Elkins, 389 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 184, 19 L.Ed.2d 228 (1967) (overbroad loyalty oath deters \nadvocacy and associations protected by the First Amendment); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. \n675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967) (seditious utterances, advocacy of forceful overthrow of government, and membership in \nthe Communist Party); Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11, 86 S.Ct. 1238, 16 L.Ed.2d 321 (1966) (freedom of association \ndeterred by overbroad loyalty oath); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (same); \nTorcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961) (freedom of religion infringed by requirement \nthat public officials declare belief in the existence of God). \n \n15  This implication also can be found in our teacher dismissal and freedom of speech cases. See, e. g., Megill v. Board of \n  Regents, supra (context of remarks justified Board action; remarks, however, were clearly public, and included \nexpressions in a press conference, in a newspaper interview, in a panel discussion attended by 50 people, at a public \nmeeting on campus, and at a meeting of the Board); Kaprelian v. Texas Womanâs Univ., 509 F.2d 133, 139 (5th Cir. \n1975) (teacher protected in voicing and applying in his teaching academic views relevant to assignments); Lewis v. \nSpencer, 490 F.2d 93 (5th Cir. 1974), affâg, 369 F.Supp. 1219 (S.D.Tex.1973) (appearance before state legislature and \n  11 \n \n\nparticipation in organizing a local chapter of a teachersâ association are protected); Duke v. North Texas State Univ., \n469 F.2d 829, 832 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 932, 93 S.Ct. 2760, 37 L.Ed.2d 160 (1973) (teacher protected \nin her remarks to students and prospective students at a meeting in a campus park); Moore v. Winfield City Bd. of \nEduc., 452 F.2d 726, 727 (5th Cir. 1971) (Board action not motivated by teacherâs expressions, which included \ncriticism of school administration in speech at a local Classroom Teachers Association dinner); Pred v. Board of Pub. \nInstruction, 415 F.2d 851, 853-54 (5th Cir. 1969) (participation in an organization and advocacy in classroom \ninstruction  of  âdemandsâ  for  campus  freedom  protected).  See  also  Abbott  v.  Thetford,  supra  (substantial \ninterference of expression with job justified dismissal; expression in the form of a lawsuit); Smith v. United States, \nsupra, at 516 (substantial interference of expression with job justified dismissal; expression made by wearing of a \npeace pin). \n \n16  Rowan is arguably distinguishable because of the citizenâs compelling interest in privacy within his or her own \n  residence. E. g., Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 420, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 1578, 29 L.Ed.2d 1, 6 \n(1971). The rationale of Rowan, however, is not limited to the home. It applies whenever âthe degree of captivity \nmakes it impractical for the unwilling viewer or auditor to avoid exposure.â Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. \n205, 209 & n. 5, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 2272 & n. 5, 45 L.Ed.2d 124, 131 & n. 5 (1975) (Powell, J.). While an intrusion on \nprivacy in the home may be of greater significance than an intrusion on privacy in the workplace, oneâs âdegree of \ncaptivityâ in the workplace may be much greater. In the normal course of his job, principal Leach could hardly avoid \nexposure to teacher Givhan and her demands, requests, and complaints. Indeed, as a practical matter Leach was a \nvery captive audience for Givhan as long as they both worked in the same school. \n \n17  Leach testified that he sent her lists of demands to the school superintendent. Apparently they were ignored. That \n  does not alter the fact that Givhan chose Leach as the only recipient of her expressions. \n \n18  E. g., In re Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 542 F.2d 297, 298 (5th Cir. 1976) (en banc) (Hill, J., dissenting), revâd, \n  â- U.S. ââ, 97 S.Ct. 1439, 52 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977). \n \n19  If on remand appellee succeeds on her Singleton claim, it will be for the district court in the first instance to \n  determine the propriety of reinstatement as a remedy in accordance with our discussion of reinstatement as to \nHodges, infra. \n \n20  Kaprelian v. Texas Womanâs Univ., supra, at 135 (Gee, J.). \n \n \n21  She testified that when she wrote and signed the recommendation she had little time and was otherwise âunder \n  pressure.â She explained that she had signed other documents for Leach before, at his request, but she admitted \nthat he did not authorize her to complete and sign in his name her own recommendation. It is also well established \nthat when she had difficulty âfindingâ Leach for his recommendation she knew he had recommended that she not \nbe rehired for the next school year. \n \n22  E.g., Moore v. School Board, 364 F.Supp. 355, 361 (N.D.Fla. 1973) (reinstatement inappropriate where teacher had \n  12 \n \n\n  abused authority by relating to students his personal experiences with prostitutes and other illegitimate topics). See \nalso Florida Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 529 F.2d 1225, 1234 (5th Cir. 1976) (employee raised fist and cursed supervisor); \nTrailmobile Division, Pullman Incorporated v. NLRB, 407 F.2d 1006, 1018 (5th Cir. 1969) (reinstatement denied to \nstriking employees who intimidated and assaulted nonstriking employee); NLRB v. Big Three Welding Equipment \nCo., 359 F.2d 77, 83 (5th Cir. 1966) (reinstatement denied to employees who pilfered company property); NLRB v. \nBin-Dicator  Company,  356  F.2d  210,  215-16  (6th  Cir.  1966)  (reinstatement denied  to employee  who made \nâfearsome threats and gesturesâ to supervisors); NLRB v.

Morris gave the following reasons for the \n  decision not to renew her contract: \nâ(1)[A] flat refusal to administer standardized national tests to the pupils in your charge; (2) an announced intention \nnot to co-operate with the administration of the Glen Allan Attendance Center; (3) and an antagonistic and hostile \nattitude to the administration of the Glen Allan Attendance Center demonstrated throughout the school year.â \n \n2  In addition to the reasons set out in the District Superintendentâs termination letter to petitioner, n. 1, supra, the \n  School District advanced several other justifications for its decision not to rehire petitioner. The Court of Appeals \ndealt with these allegations in a footnote: \nâAppellants also sought to establish these other bases for the decision not to rehire: (1) that Givhan âdowngradedâ \nthe papers of white students; (2) that she was one of a number of teachers who walked out of a meeting about \ndesegregation in the fall of 1969 and attempted to disrupt it by blowing automobile horns outside the gymnasium; \n(3) that the school district had received a threat by Givhan and other teachers not to return to work when schools \nreopened on a unitary basis in February, 1970; and (4) that Givhan had protected a student during a weapons \nshakedown at Riverside in March, 1970, by concealing a studentâs knife until completion of a search. The evidence \non the first three of these points was inconclusive and the district judge did not clearly err in rejecting or ignoring it. \nGivhan admitted the fourth incident, but the district judge properly rejected that as a justification for her not being \nrehired, as there was no evidence that [the principal] relied on it in making his recommendation.â Ayers v. Western \nLine Consol. School Dist., 555 F.2d 1309, 1313 n. 7 (CA5 1977). \n \n3  The Pickering Courtâs decision upholding a teacherâs First Amendment claim was influenced by the fact that the \n  teacherâs public statements had not adversely affected his working relationship with the objects of his criticism: \nâThe statements [were] in no way directed towards any person with whom appellant would normally be in contact \nin the course of his daily work as a teacher. Thus no question of maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors \nor harmony among coworkers is presented here. Appellantâs employment relationships with the Board and, to a \nsomewhat lesser extent, with the superintendent are not the kind of close working relationships for which it can \npersuasively be claimed that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning.â 391 U.S., at \n569â570, 88 S.Ct. at 1735. \n \n4  Although  the  First  Amendmentâs  protection  of government  employees  extends  to  private  as  well  as  public \n  4 \n \n\n  expression, striking the Pickering balance in each context may involve different considerations. When a teacher \nspeaks publicly, it is generally the content of his statements that must be assessed to determine whether they âin \nany way either impeded the teacherâs proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom or . . . interfered with \nthe regular operation of the schools generally.â Id., at 572â573, 88 S.Ct., at 1737. Private expression, however, may \nin some situations bring additional factors to the Pickering calculus. When a government employee personally \nconfronts his immediate superior, the employing agencyâs institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the \ncontent of the employeeâs message but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered. \n \n5  We cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that the record in this case does not admit of the argument that \n  petitioner would have been terminated regardless of her âdemands.â Even absent consideration of petitionerâs \nprivate encounters with the principal, a decision to terminate based on the reasons detailed at nn. 1 and 2, supra, \nwould hardly strike us as surprising. Additionally, in his letter to petitioner setting forth the reasons for her \ntermination, District Superintendent Morris makes no mention of petitionerâs âdemandsâ and âcriticism.â See n. 1, \nsupra. \n \n*  App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a. See also id., at 36a, where the District Court stated that petitionerâs protected activity was \n  âalmost entirelyâ responsible for her termination. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  5 \n ",

Law Rep. 242 \nThe  decision  of  the  district  court  ordering  the   \nreinstatement  of  Givhan  in  her teaching  position, and \nFootnotes \n \n1  The Court held that, since the case was tried before the issuance of its decision in Mt. Healthy City Board of \n  Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), the school board had not produced evidence, \nand the district court had not made a factual finding, on the Mt. Healthy issue as to whether Givhan would have \nbeen rehired but for her criticism. 439 U.S. at 417, 99 S.Ct. at 697. Previous to the Supreme Courtâs decision, the \ndistrict court had held that Ms. Givhanâs First Amendment expression was the primary cause of the non-renewal of \nher contract, cf. Ayers v. Western Line Consolidated School District, 404 F.Supp. 1225 (N.D.Miss.1975), and this \ncourt affirmed this finding as not clearly erroneous but had held that the private expression of views to the school \nprincipal was not protected by the First Amendment, Ayers v. Western Line Consolidated School District, 555 F.2d \n1309, 1315, 1318 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. granted, 435 U.S. 950, 98 S.Ct. 1575, 55 L.Ed.2d 799 (1978). \n \n2  The district relies on the Courtâs footnote statements that, â(e)ven absent consideration of petitionerâs private \n  encounters with the principal, a decision to terminate based on the reasons detailed (involving an alleged hostile \nattitude and non-expression reasons) would hardly strike us as surprisingâ, 439 U.S. at 417 (n.5), 99 S.Ct. at 697 \n(n.5), and that â(w)hen a government employee personally confronts his immediate superior, the employing \nagencyâs institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the employeeâs message but also by \nthe manner, time, and place in which it is deliveredâ, 439 U.S. at 415 (n.3), 99 S.Ct. at 696 (n.3). \n \n3  Even were we to accept that the issue is now before us of whether First Amendment protection extended to \n  Givhanâs privately uttered criticisms, we could conclude under the non-clearly-erroneous factual findings made by \nthe district court (that the alleged reasons for discharge were after-thoughts or pretextual) that the trial court could \nhave  properly  found  that  Givhanâs  criticisms  were  private  expressions  properly  made  and  entitled  to  First \nAmendment protection. \nIndeed, the Givhan decision of the Supreme Court, see quoted statements in note 2 supra, alerted the district court \nthat, under Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), a governmental \nemployeeâs constitutional right of private expression upon matters of public concern must be balanced against the \ninterest of the employment agency in promoting the efficiency of the public service. 439 U.S. at 414, 99 S.Ct. at 696. \nHad the present defendant district contested this issue in the trial court, it is obvious from the district courtâs factual \nfindings that, as a matter of law, Schneider v. City of Atlanta, 628 F.2d 915, 919 & n.4 (5th Cir. 1980), Givhanâs critical \nexpressions to her superior were not delivered in a manner, time, or place so as to threaten the employing agencyâs \ninstitutional efficiency and thus lose their constitutional protection. Under other circumstances, of course, a private \nconfrontation of an employee with his superior might not be entitled to First Amendment protection. See note 2 \n  3 \n \n\nsupra. \n \n4  The principal also alleged that she had refused to give achievement tests. On our initial hearing, we affirmed the \n  district courtâs finding that this was not a reason seriously relied upon; although Givhan at first demurred on \nnonfrivolous grounds, she did in fact administer the tests. See our initial opinion, Ayers, supra, 555 F.2d at 1313. The \nopinion also speaks of a minor confrontation over giving a six-week test, not initially formally relied upon as a reason \nfor the discharge, id., 555 F.2d at 1312, but now advanced as a real reason for Ms. Givhanâs termination. We find no \nreason on this appeal to disturb the district courtâs credibility evaluation that these reasons now assigned as \nmotivating the discharge were in the nature of pretextual. \n \n5  The knife-shakedown incident had not been mentioned by the principal as a matter of his personal knowledge prior \n  to the hearing on remand nine years later. Following the incident, Ms. Givhan had been rehired for the 1970-71 \nschool year. We are unable to disturb the district courtâs credibility evaluation of the principalâs testimony that this \nincident played no part in the decision to rehire, and was in the nature of an afterthought. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4 \n ",
