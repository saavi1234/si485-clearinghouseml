    "summary": "<p><em>Introduction &amp; Importance of this Case</em></p>\r\n<p>In early 2012, the federal government initiated criminal prosecution of Jamshid Muhtorov (January 19) and Bakhityor Jumaev (March 14) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Both defendants were charged with providing, conspiring to provide, and attempting to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization, in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. &sect; 2339B. Defendants were represented by the Federal Public Defender (Muhtorov) and counsel appointed under the Criminal Justice Act (Jumaev), as well as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado. After close to six years of litigation, both men were convicted.</p>\r\n<p>This case is in the Clearinghouse because the parties litigated the constitutionality of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA). While Section 702 is the focus of this summary, more details on the underlying criminal prosecution are provided at the end. This case is also the first time the government notified a defendant of the government's intent to use information gained from a FISA warrantless wiretap after a 2013 DOJ internal policy change. The question of whether or not the 2008 FISA Amendments Act is constitutional is expected to ultimately reach the Supreme Court. All the cases regarding criminal challenges to warrantless wiretapping are available in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Criminal cases challenging FISA surveillance</a> special collection.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to challenging the FAA, defendants also challenged evidence acquired through surveillance under other provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); these issues are addressed briefly at the beginning.</p>\r\n<p><em>Initiation of the Criminal Case</em></p>\r\n<p>Muhtorov, who spent most of his life in Uzbekistan as a human rights activist but resettled in Colorado in 2007 as a political refugee, was accused of providing material support to the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU), an extremist organization. The FBI investigated Muhtorov's communications with an IJU-affiliated website, which allegedly include committing his allegiance to IJU and arranging to send funds to IJU.</p>\r\n<p>On January 19, 2012, Muhtorov was charged by complaint and arrested at O'Hare Airport a few days later, while attempting to travel overseas. This case involves \"numerous intrusive\" searches of his computer, email accounts, personal residence, and personal effects, including interceptions of his communications.</p>\r\n<p>On March 14, 2012, the government filed a complaint against Jumaev, a friend of Muhtorov who resided in Pennsylvania. He was arrested on March 15 on the same charges. In particular, the government alleged that he pledged support for the IJU and sent Muhtorov $300 intended for the IJU.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after Muhtorov's initial appearance in Colorado on February 2, 2012, the government notified defendants that it intended to use and offer into evidence information obtained through electronic surveillance and physical search conducted pursuant to FISA. Notice was made to Muhtorov on February 7, 2012 and later to Jumaev on April 4, 2012. Muhtorov moved to suppress the use of FISA-acquired evidence for purposes of his bail hearing on February 8, 2012 and for bail on February 13, 2012. The government responded on February 10, claiming that a detention hearing could be held using FISA-derived information while FISA suppression litigation was pending.</p>\r\n<p>On February 15, 2012, Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty order Muhtorov detained pending trial. In doing so, Magistrate Judge Hegarty found that when a defendant moves to suppress FISA-acquired information which the government intends to use in a hearing, the court must determine whether the surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted under FISA &sect; 1806(f). However, a contradictory provision, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3142(f), states that the rules of admissibility do not apply to evidence used for determining pretrial detention. Magistrate Judge Hegarty ultimately relied on &sect; 3142(f), as applied in <em>United States v. Hightower</em>, 203 F.3d 836 (10th Cir. 2000), which permitted reliance during detention on FISA material even if it was ultimately determined to be inadmissible.</p>\r\n<p>Muhtorov appealed the Magistrate Judge's detention order to the district court on March 1, 2012. District Judge John L. Kane denied that motion on April 11, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Jumaev was arrested on March 15, 2012 and made his first appearance in the District of Colorado on April 2, 2012. The government gave Junaev notice that it intended to use FISA evidence against him at trial on April 4, 2012. On April 12, 2012, Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland ordered Jumaev detained pending trial.</p>\r\n<p><em>Litigation Over FISA</em></p>\r\n<p>On May 25, 2012, Muhtorov filed a supplement to his initial motion to suppress FISA-acquired evidence during the trial. On July 30, 2012, Jumaev filed several FISA related motions, including a motion (1) to adopt Muhtorov's motion to suppress, (2) for disclosure of FISA materials, and (3) for leave to file a Franks motion after receipt of the government's discovery. Judge Kane denied Muhtorov's motion to suppress and Jumaev's FISA-related motions on September 24, 2012. After conducting an in camera review, Judge Kane found that the FISA motions failed because the facts supported a finding of probable cause to believe that defendants were agents of a foreign power under FISA.</p>\r\n<p>Issues relating to Section 702 of the FAA arose on October 25, 2013 when the government filed a notice of intent to use information obtained under the FAA, &sect; 1881(a), against Muhtorov. The government did not provide such notice to Jumaev.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike traditional FISA, Section 702 of the FAA does not require the government to demonstrate probable cause that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Further, it does not require the government to specify the nature of the surveillance or the particular location of where the electronic surveillance will occur. When the government makes an FAA application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\"), it simply asks the court to approve the overall targeting and minimization procedures that will guide the government's surveillance. Until recently, the government had a policy of concealing from criminal defendants any connection between the FAA and their prosecutions. When the government's policy of withholding notice of FAA surveillance came to light after <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Clapper v. Amnesty International</em>, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (2013)</a>, the DOJ changed its policy and affirmed its notice obligation. Muhtorov was the first person charged as a defendant in a criminal prosecution to receive notice of FAA surveillance.</p>\r\n<p>After the initiation of the case, the parties engaged in discovery, and the court addressed a number of issues related to detention, a protective order, the Classified Information Procedure Act, and translation of documents. On October 25, 2013 the government filed a notice of intent to use FAA-obtained information as to Muhtorov, at which point the parties began litigating Section 702.</p>\r\n<p>On January 29, 2014, Muhtorov filed a motion to suppress FAA-obtained evidence and a motion for discovery. He challenged the constitutionality of Section 702, claiming that such monitoring of his communications violated both the warrant and reasonableness requirements of the Fourth Amendment. He also claimed that Section 702 violated Article III, because it authorized the FISC to issue mass acquisition orders in the absence of any case or controversy and review the legality of government procedures in the abstract. Muhtorov also moved for discovery to permit him to understand the role that the FAA played in the government's investigation so he could challenge the specific manner the FAA was used in his case. Muhtorov claimed that he was entitled to such discovery under FISA and the Due Process clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>As Jumaev had not been provided notice that the government intended to use FAA-obtained evidence against him, on October 28, 2013 he moved for notice of whether the government intended to use such evidence. The government responded on November 19 that it would have provided notice if it intended to use FAA-obtained information. Jumaev filed a reply on January 10, 2014, claiming that there were grounds to believe that FAA-derived evidence was used against him. On January 30, 2014, he moved to adopt Muhtorov's motion to suppress.</p>\r\n<p>On May 9, 2014, the government filed a response to Muhtorov's motion to suppress. Defense counsel was provided with a redacted, unclassified version of the response. On May 22, 2014, the government filed its classified response in camera, ex parte, and under seal. In the unclassified response, the government claimed as follows: that Jumaev lacked standing to challenge the FAA; that court review should be limited to an as applied (rather than facial) challenge; that 702 was constitutional as applied; that government actions were lawfully authorized and conducted in accordance with the FAA; that defendants' discovery requests should be denied to the extent they seek disclosure of FAA related materials; and that the good faith exception to exclusionary rule applied.</p>\r\n<p>On June 12, 2014, Muhtorov moved to require the government to disclose or provide defense counsel access to its classified pleading and objected to ex parte proceedings. On June 18, Jumaev filed a similar motion to disclose. On July 2, the government filed a combined response to the motions for disclosure, claiming that the FAA does not allow a defendant such relief unless the court finds, after conducting its own ex parte review of the FISA material, that disclosure of portions of that material is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, the government also supplemented its response to defendants' motion to suppress with the opinion in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13875\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>United States v. Mohamud</em>, 2014 WL 2866749 (D. Or. June 24, 2014)</a>, which upheld the constitutionality of Section 702. Muhtorov filed a reply to the government's response on July 3, 2014, and Jumaev filed a reply on July 11.</p>\r\n<p>On October 20, 2014, Jumaev filed an attorney surveillance motion requiring the government to provide notice of interceptions of defense counsel communications. Muhrotov moved to adopt this motion on October 28.</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, 2015, Judge Kane denied the defendants' motion to suppress. 187 F. Supp. 3d 1240. He held that, both on its face and as applied to the defendants, Section 702 did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Judge Kane also held that Section 702 did not violate Article III, but did not offer any analysis as to how he reached this judgment, leaving this issue \"to a higher court.\"</p>\r\n<p>After an interview was given by defense counsel to a local broadcast journalist on October 29, 2014, the government filed a motion to clarify the protective order. On December 3, 2014, Judge Kane granted the motion to clarify the protective order. He noted that, with the exception of disclosing sensitive discovery materials, counsel were free to make extrajudicial statements and that there was no basis for sanctions in this situation. Judge Kane advised that it would be prudent for counsel not to make extrajudicial comments, but that the freedom of expression permitted it.</p>\r\n<p>In January of 2018, both the House and Senate passed amendments reauthorizing Section 702, and on January 19, 2018, the President's signature made the FISA Amendments Act of 2017 law. The reauthorization extended Section 702 for another six years, setting it to expire on December 31, 2023.</p>\r\n<p><em>Post-FISA Litigation</em></p>\r\n<p>On June 23, 2017, the court granted Muhtorov's motion for bail, but abated the order for his release so that the specific combination of conditions that would be attached to his release could be determined with comment from all sides. After a hearing a few days later, the court approved a release on certain conditions and got a stay pending the Tenth Circuit's decision. On July 21, 2017, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court decision and ordered Muhtorov detained pending trial. 702 F. App'x 694. Muhtorov's petition for writ of certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court on November 6, 2017. 138 S. Ct. 430.</p>\r\n<p>After years of litigating discovery and evidentiary issues related to FISA, Jumaev's case went to trial in March 2018. After a 25-day jury trial, Jumaev was convicted of all charges against him. However, on July 19, 2018, Judge Kane sentenced Jumaev to time served (approximately six years of pretrial detention) and 10 years of supervised release.</p>\r\n<p>Muhtorov's jury trial began on May 24, 2018. On June 21, 2018, Muhtorov was found guilty on counts one, two, and three of the second superseding indictment. On August 30, 2018, Judge Kane sentenced Muhtorov to 96 months imprisonment on counts one and two, and 132 months on count three, all to run concurrently, for a total term of 132 months. Muhtorov was also placed on supervised release for 15 years as to counts one, two, and three.</p>\r\n<p><em>Appeals</em></p>\r\n<p>Both defendants filed direct appeals of their convictions, and the Tenth Circuit consolidated the appeals.</p>\r\n<p>Jumaev claimed on appeal that the six-year delay between his arrest and trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial. He also argued that the district court should have sanctioned the government for its inability to comply with discovery and Brady obligations and argued that certain search warrants were illegally obtained.</p>\r\n<p>Muhtorov joined Jumaev's speedy trial challenge, and made several other challenges to FISA. Muhtorov argued that the electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to Section 702 of FISA violated the Fourth Amendment and that the government's refusal to disclose underlying materials for the Section 702 surveillance and possible use of other warrantless surveillance to investigate Muhtorov were unconstitutional and contrary to statute.</p>\r\n<p>On November 19, 2020, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit consisting of Circuit Judges Carlos F. Lucero, Scott Matheson Jr., and Allison H. Eid heard oral argument on the appeal.</p>\r\n<p>The Tenth Circuit affirmed Muhtorov (20 F.4th 558) and Jumaev's (20 F.4th 518) convictions and sentences in separate opinions on December 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In affirming Muhtorov&rsquo;s conviction, the Tenth Circuit addressed several constitutional and statutory challenges. First, the court held that it was constitutional for the government to collect Muhtorov&rsquo;s communications without a warrant. The government had initially collected Muhtorov&rsquo;s communications incidentally while monitoring the communications of &ldquo;a non-United States person living abroad,&rdquo; which does not require a warrant. The court relied on two Fourth Amendment doctrines&ndash;the &ldquo;incidental overhear&rdquo; doctrine and the &ldquo;plain view&rdquo; doctrine&ndash;to conclude that this incidental collection did not require a warrant. The court further concluded that the incidental collection was reasonable, based on a balancing of Muhtorov&rsquo;s privacy interests and the government&rsquo;s national security interests. Second, the court held that the FISC&rsquo;s rulings&ndash;which applied to the government&rsquo;s surveillance procedures, rather than specific instances of surveillance&ndash;were constitutional under Article III because they involved actual cases or controversies, and were not merely advisory opinions. The court also held that the FISC&rsquo;s rulings complied with the separation of powers.</p>\r\n<p>Third, the Tenth Circuit held that neither the FISA statute nor due process required the district court to compel disclosure of classified materials related to the government&rsquo;s application for authorization to conduct surveillance. The court further held that due process, evidentiary statutes, and the Federal Rules did not require the district court to compel disclosure of the particular surveillance methods the government used, or the evidence it gathered through surveillance. Finally, the court held that the six-and-a-half-year delay from arrest to conviction, though extraordinarily long, did not violate Muhtorov&rsquo;s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The court found that the delay was not unconstitutional because it was caused by issues with discovery, such as Muhtorov&rsquo;s broad requests and requirements surrounding classified information. Further, the court found that the government had acted in good faith during discovery.</p>\r\n<p>In its opinion affirming Jumaev&rsquo;s conviction, the Tenth Circuit rejected the speedy trial argument on similar grounds. The court found that the delay was largely caused by legitimate discovery issues, and additionally that Jumaev had not asserted his right to a speedy trial promptly enough. Next, the Tenth Circuit rejected Jumaev&rsquo;s argument that the district court should have sanctioned the government more harshly for its discovery violations. The Tenth Circuit found that the government had acted with good faith, and that the district court&rsquo;s response to the discovery violations had cured any prejudice from those violations. Finally, the Tenth Circuit rejected Jumaev&rsquo;s argument that warrants to search his home, phone, and computer violated Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. &nbsp;The court held that Rule 41(b)(3)&ndash;which allows magistrate judges to issue warrants reaching outside their own district when the warrant is related to a terrorism case with some connection to that district&ndash;does not require that the government specify the connection to that district in its warrant application.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Lucero dissented from both rulings. The Tenth Circuit denied both defendants&rsquo; petitions to rehear the case en banc. Both defendants appealed the Tenth Circuit rulings to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case on October 3, 2022. 143 S. Ct. 245; 143 S. Ct. 246.</p>",

It was not in place when the foreign target under investigation \ncommunicated with Mr. Muhtorov. \n \n8  As is the case for traditional FISA, the government may appeal an adverse ruling to the FISCR, and then to the \n  Supreme Court. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(j)(4). \n \n9  In exigent circumstances, the AG and DNI may issue their own authorization to begin collecting Section 702 \n  intelligence without first obtaining FISC approval. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(c)(2). Such an authorization also lasts for one \nyear. Id. § 1881a(a). \n \n10  The district court also denied Mr. Muhtorov’s request for disclosure of classified FISA application materials. As \n  explained below, he appeals this denial. \n \n11  In City of Los Angeles v. Patel, 576 U.S. 409, 135 S.Ct. 2443, 192 L.Ed.2d 435 (2015), the Supreme Court stated that a \n  Fourth Amendment facial challenge to a statute authorizing warrantless searches succeeds when a challenger \nestablishes that a “law is unconstitutional in all of its applications,” considering only those “searches that the law \nactually authorizes, not those for which it is irrelevant.” Id. at 418, 135 S.Ct. 2443. Because we conclude that the \nincidental collection of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications during surveillance authorized by Section 702 and properly \ncarried out according to the statute was constitutional, Mr. Muhtorov’s facial challenge necessarily fails. See United \nStates v. Durham, 902 F.3d 1180, 1192 n.3 (10th Cir. 2018). \n \n12  The dissent joins Mr. Muhtorov in speculating that “the decision to seek traditional FISA authority” may have been \n  “influenced by ... querying of § 702 databases by the FBI using identifiers associated with [Mr.] Muhtorov” or “by \ninformation collected in other intelligence surveillance programs[.]” Dissent at 677. Without finding any support in \nthe record, it instead suggests querying may have happened based on its reading of the PCLOB report. See id. at 677. \nBut whatever light that report sheds on national security surveillance programs generally, it is not evidence in the \nrecord here. Nor is the FBI Domestic and Investigations Guide dated December 16, 2008, which the dissent cites \n(Dissent at 676), but the district court and the parties never mentioned. \nThe dissent also states “there is no evidence in the record either that querying did not occur or that the government \n75 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nagents who directed or sought the traditional FISA application did not know of its existence.” Id. at 678. We \ngenerally do not require parties to prove a negative, see Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 218, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 \nL.Ed.2d 1669 (1960), especially here where the record supports that querying was not used to prepare the \ntraditional FISA applications. Appellate courts should not “speculate about what might have been.” See Davis v. \nAyala, 576 U.S. 257, 281, 135 S.Ct. 2187, 192 L.Ed.2d 323 (2015). \nIndeed, the dissent goes beyond asking the government to prove a negative. It accuses the government, without \nsubstantiation, of “fail[ing] ... to introduce any evidence that it complied with ... record-keeping responsibilities” \nregarding queries, see Dissent at 677 & n.29. But there were no statutory record-keeping requirements during the \ninvestigation in this case. Some were added to Section 702 years later in 2018. See Pub. L. No. 115-118, § 101 \n(codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(f)(1)(A), (B)). And the dissent’s reference to FBI minimization procedures in the 2014 \nPCLOB report similarly tells us nothing about what rules may have applied during the Section 702 surveillance here, \nlet alone whether there was FBI “non-compliance.” Dissent at 677. None of this changes that querying, as we have \ndetermined based on our independent review of the record, is not an issue in this case. \n \n13  The dissent thus incorrectly asserts that we are “avoid[ing] difficult constitutional questions by accepting as true \n  unsupported factual assertions” in the government’s brief, see Dissent at 673, or “pay[ing] mere lip service” to \nreviewing the classified record, id. at 675 n.25. We have conducted a careful and thorough de novo review of the \nclassified and public records and disagree with the dissent’s unfounded assertions. \n \n14  As discussed above, PRISM and upstream collection are two different ways to collect communications under Section \n  702. The government represents that “[t]his case does not involve upstream collection.” ROA, Vol. III at 600; accord \nAplee. Br. at 29 n.12. The dissent contends this assertion is “unsupported,” Dissent at 675 n.24, noting that “no \nevidence in the record excludes” the possibility that upstream collection was used to gather Mr. Muhtorov’s \ncommunication, id. But our own independent review of the public and classified records supports the government’s \nrepresentation. As an appellate court, we rely on the record and avoid conjecture about extra-record occurrences. \nSee Davis, 576 U.S. at 281, 135 S.Ct. 2187. \nJust as we decline to address possible constitutional issues regarding querying of Section 702 databases, we decline \nto consider possible constitutional issues concerning upstream collection of communications. See Redacted, 2011 \nWL 10945618, at *25-26 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011) (discussing constitutional issues raised by upstream collection). The \nrecord contains no indication that either upstream collection or querying Section 702 databases led to the \ntraditional FISA applications. \n \n15  Although Coolidge characterized the plain view doctrine as an “exception to the warrant requirement,” a Supreme \n  Court plurality has suggested that “this description may be somewhat inaccurate.” Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, \n738, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) (plurality opinion). Under that view, the plain view doctrine “provides \ngrounds for seizure of an item when an officer’s access to an object has some prior justification under the Fourth \nAmendment.” Id. Thus, plain view is perhaps “better understood, ... not as an independent ‘exception’ to the \nwarrant clause, but simply as an extension of whatever the prior justification for an officer’s ‘access to an object’ \nmay be.” Id. at 738-39, 103 S.Ct. 1535. \n \n16  Thus, once a court determines that the government satisfied the plain view doctrine’s requirements, it does not \n76 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n  continue to determine whether the warrantless seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment balancing \ntest because the test already accounts for the interests of the government and the defendant embodied in the \n“central requirement of reasonableness.” Soldal, 506 U.S. at 66, 113 S.Ct. 538; see also, e.g., Naugle, 997 F.2d at \n822-23. \nWe apply the reasonableness balancing test below because we do not rely solely on the plain view doctrine to \nconclude no warrant was required. \n \n17  Our analysis of whether a warrant was required and our discussion below about whether the surveillance in this \n  case passed the reasonableness balancing test overlap. The touchstone of any determination that a warrant was not \nrequired is “reasonableness,” Brigham City, 547 U.S. at 403, 126 S.Ct. 1943, and even when a warrant was not \nrequired, the search must still be “reasonable” under the balancing test in Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. at 448, 133 \nS.Ct. 1958. \n \n18  Mr. Muhtorov also asserts that courts have required the government to obtain a warrant after an initial seizure of \n  an electronic device to conduct a further search of the device’s contents. For example, in Riley, 573 U.S. at 401, 134 \nS.Ct. 2473, the Supreme Court said that law enforcement usually must get a warrant to search a cell phone that had \nbeen seized in a search. But Mr. Muhtorov has not explained why Riley’s discussion of cell phones applies to this \nsituation, in which the government first lawfully seized the contents of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications. \n \n19  As explained below, Mr. Muhtorov’s reasonableness argument focuses on the government’s alleged ability to \n  “retain, use, and deliberately query” Section 702 databases. Aplt. Br. at 36. He does not specifically argue that the \nincidental collection of his communications, as opposed to the post-seizure use of those communications, fails the \nFourth Amendment’s balancing test. We conduct the reasonableness balancing test for the sake of completeness \nbefore addressing Mr. Muhtorov’s specific arguments. \n \n20  In Hasbajrami, the Second Circuit remanded “[b]ecause the district court was not even aware whether such \n  querying had occurred,” and the district court had to determine, in the first instance, whether a constitutional \nviolation had occurred. See 945 F.3d at 676. This case is different. As the government points out, Mr. Hasbajrami’s \nguilty plea and resulting lack of a trial “limited the reviewing court’s ability to determine whether there might have \nbeen evidence potentially derived from queries.” Redacted Aplee. Suppl. Br. at 12. Here, there was a trial, and we \nhave determined, based on our own independent review of the classified record (including the government’s \nclassified brief, the traditional FISA applications, and the chronology filed with the district court on November 10, \n2015), that the only Section 702 evidence at issue—the incidentally collected communications that supported the \ntraditional FISA applications—was not the product of querying. \nThe dissent believes the government’s representation that it did not use querying to prepare the traditional FISA \napplications is “directly contradicted by other government representations in its classified brief.” Dissent at 673. We \ndiscern no contradiction. We also disagree that “we are left to guess at the answers to critically important questions \nin the derivative evidence inquiry, e.g., which communications the government received at which times, whether \nand  when  querying  occurred,  and  what  information  motivated  the  government  to  seek  traditional  FISA \nauthorization.” Id. at 677 n.28. \n77 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n \n21  Querying is a technical term defined as “the use of one or more terms to retrieve the unminimized contents or \n  noncontents located in electronic and data storage systems of communications of or concerning United States \npersons obtained through acquisitions authorized [in Section 702].” 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(f)(3)(B). “Use” of already \ncollected evidence, as distinct from querying, does not constitute a separate Fourth Amendment event. The dissent \nappears to concede that the use of already collected Section 702 communications without reliance on querying does \nnot trigger the Fourth Amendment. We agree. See Dissent at 679 n.31. \nApart from this apparent concession, the dissent misreads Hasbajrami’s discussion of querying. In questioning our \nanalysis upholding the government’s use of incidentally collected Section 702 communications to support traditional \nFISA applications, the dissent relies on the Second Circuit’s discussion of querying, which is not pertinent to this \ncase. See Dissent at 679 n.30 (citing Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 670-73). Instead, the relevant portion of Hasbajrami \nfully supports our position: “[B]oth the collection of such communications and the dissemination of information \nfrom  such  collection  about  potential  criminal  actions  within  the  country  to  domestic  law  enforcement  are \nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” 945 F.3d at 667-68. The dissent makes the same mistake with Riley, \nwhich concerned the search of a phone after it had been seized. See Dissent at 680. For why Riley does not apply \nhere, see footnote 18, supra. \n \n22  Because we find there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and therefore no need to suppress evidence, we need \n  not address the government’s alternative argument that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies. \n \n23  The district court discussed these arguments but “le[ft] to a higher court” to determine whether Section 702 violates \n  Article III. ROA, Vol. III at 137. It stated that, “[f]or purposes of [this case], my judgment is that it does not.” Id. \n \n24  As explained below, Article III justiciability is rooted in separation of powers principles. \n \n \n25  In so doing, we join the Ninth Circuit in Mohamud, the only other circuit court to address a similar challenge. In a \n  brief footnote, it first found that “FISC opinions are not advisory because the FISC either approves or denies the \nrequested acquisition (and electronic communication service providers must follow the directives or challenge \nthem).” Mohamud, 843 F.3d at 444 n.28. It also found “the FISC survives separation of powers and non-delegation \nchallenges, as FISC review of § 702 surveillance applications does not ‘interfere with the prerogatives of another \nbranch of government beyond requiring the executive branch to conform to the statute,’ and is ‘central to the \nmission of the judiciary’ as it is similar to ‘the review of search warrants and wiretap applications.’ ” Id. (brackets \nomitted) (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 388, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989)). \n \n26  The parties do not dispute that the FISC is an Article III court. Indeed, the FISC and FISCR have long recognized that it \n  is. See, e.g., In re Opinions & Orders, No. Misc. 13-08, 2020 WL 897659, at *4 (FISC Feb. 11, 2020) (describing the \nancillary and inherent powers the FISC possesses “[a]s an Article III court”); In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 731, 732 \nn.19 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (per curiam) (rejecting an argument that “the statutory responsibilities of the FISA court \nare inconsistent with Article III case and controversy responsibilities”). Other federal courts also have so recognized. \n78 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nSee ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 828 (2d Cir. 2015) (Sack, J., concurring) (“The FISC, like the quotidian federal \ndistrict courts and courts of appeals, is established under Article III of the Constitution.”); Megahey, 553 F. Supp. at \n1196-97 (rejecting arguments that the FISC is not properly constituted under Article III). \n \n27  As noted above, Congress added the requirement for the government to adopt, and the FISC to approve, querying \n  procedures in 2018. See Kris & Wilson § 3:9. Before 2018, only targeting and minimization procedures were \nreviewed in Section 702 proceedings. \n \n28  The FISC’s most recent certification decisions confirm that it continues to apply law and its own precedent to the \n  government’s  specific  factual  submissions.  See  Redacted  (FISC  Nov.  18,  2020),  https://perma.cc/G9NQ-XTLS; \nRedacted (FISC Dec. 6, 2019), https://perma.cc/49X6-5N5G; Redacted, 402 F. Supp. 3d 45, 52 (FISC 2018). \n \n29  Although the dissent notes “the absence of adverse parties or adverse legal interests,” Dissent at 685 & 683 n.34, \n  Mr. Muhtorov does not object to the non-adversarial nature of Section 702 proceedings, see Aplt. Reply Br. at 24 \n(“The problem is not that the FISC’s review is one-sided ....”). We agree with Mr. Muhtorov. \nThe ex parte Section 702 proceedings are comparable to other adjudication that does not raise Article III concerns, \nsuch as courts’ issuing traditional warrants and Title III orders, and the FISC’s issuing traditional FISA orders. See \nMegahey, 553 F. Supp. at 1196 (rejecting an Article III challenge to traditional FISA and finding no “basis for \nconcluding that a court exercising exclusively ex parte powers is constitutionally improper because of the case or \ncontroversy jurisdictional requirement inherent in Article III”); In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 732 n.19 (“[W]e do not \nthink there is much left to an argument made by an opponent of FISA in 1978 that the statutory responsibilities of \nthe FISA court are inconsistent with Article III case and controversy responsibilities of federal judges because of the \nsecret, non-adversary process.”); James E. Pfander & Daniel D. Birk, Article III Judicial Power, the Adverse-Party \nRequirement, and Non-Contentious Jurisdiction, 124 Yale L.J. 1346, 1416 (2015) (“[T]he uncontroversial decision to \ninclude  equity  and  admiralty  ‘cases’  in  the  federal  constitutional  catalog  provides  solid  evidence  that \nnon-contentious jurisdiction was considered an acceptable dimension of the business of Article III courts.”). \nAs the Supreme Court observed: \n[F]ederal courts and judges have long performed a variety of functions that, like the functions involved here, do \nnot necessarily or directly involve adversarial proceedings within a trial or appellate court. For example, federal \ncourts have traditionally supervised grand juries and assisted in their “investigative function” by, if necessary, \ncompelling the testimony of witnesses. Federal courts also participate in the issuance of search warrants, and \nreview applications for wiretaps, both of which may require a court to consider the nature and scope of \ncriminal investigations on the basis of evidence or affidavits submitted in an ex parte proceeding. \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 681 n.20, 108 S.Ct. 2597, 101 L.Ed.2d 569 (1988) (citations omitted). \nThe dissent relies on a distinction between “adverse legal arguments” and “adverse legal interests.” See Anne \nWoolhandler, Adverse Interests and Article III, 111 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1025, 1032 (2017). The Supreme Court has drawn a \nsimilar distinction between the “prudential” preference for concrete adverseness, “which sharpens the presentation \nof the issues,” and “adequate Art. III adverseness.” United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 760, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 186 \nL.Ed.2d 808 (2013) (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962)). The latter is present \nwhen the court’s decision “will have real meaning.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 939-40, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d \n79 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n317 (1983). Section 702 proceedings have “real meaning” for the government, the ISPs that respond to Section 702 \norders, and the individuals to be surveilled. The ISPs and the individual targets of surveillance are not known at the \ntime of the Section 702 proceedings and thus cannot present “adverse legal arguments.” But they have “adverse \nlegal interests” to the government, which satisfies Article III. \n \n30  We take guidance from courts addressing whether a plaintiff’s request for a declaratory judgment would result in an \n  advisory opinion. This court has explained that “what makes a declaratory judgment action a proper judicial \nresolution of a case or controversy rather than an advisory opinion is the settling of some dispute which affects the \nbehavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff.” Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Bureau of Reclamation, 601 F.3d \n1096, 1109-10 (10th Cir. 2010) (quotations omitted). In other words, judicial resolution “would affect the behavior \nof the particular parties.” Jordan v. Sosa, 654 F.3d 1012, 1025 (10th Cir. 2011). \n \n31  The dissent asserts there is no difference between Section 702 proceedings and President Washington’s attempt in \n  1793 to obtain an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court on treaty relations with France. See Dissent at 684; \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 176, 136 S.Ct. 663, 193 L.Ed.2d 571 (2016) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) \n(describing the circumstances of President Washington’s request to the Supreme Court). According to the dissent, \n“[h]ad  the  Court  answered  [President  Washington],  its  answers  too  would  have  had  immediate  real-world \nconsequences and binding legal force.” Dissent at 684. But any such answers would not have had any formal legal \nforce. President Washington would have been free to ignore the Supreme Court’s advice without immediate legal \nconsequence. \nIn contrast, a FISC Section 702 order has immediate legal effect on the government’s ability to surveil individuals. So \nlong as a Section 702 authorization is in effect, an electronic communication service provider must “immediately \nprovide the Government with all information, facilities, or assistance necessary to accomplish the acquisition” \nwhenever the AG and DNI direct the service provider to do so. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(1)(A). And a criminal defendant \nwould be able to suppress any evidence derived from unauthorized Section 702 surveillance. See id. § 1806(e). \n \n32  Importantly, unlike the typical situation in which an Article III court restrains itself from issuing an advisory opinion \n  on an issue that a litigant would like answered because the real-world results of the opinion would be non-existent \nor “speculative,” see, e.g., Preiser, 422 U.S. at 403-04, 95 S.Ct. 2330, the FISC’s Section 702 actions are taken at the \nbehest of Congress and the Attorney General under a statutory command, see generally 50 U.S.C. § 1881a. \nCongress’s role in directing the AG and DNI to seek FISC review is relevant to the Article III challenge. See Commodity \nFutures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 851, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986) (“[I]n reviewing Article III \nchallenges, we have weighed a number of factors ... with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action \nwill have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary.”). Here, the Article III concern about advisory \nopinions, which is rooted in the separation of powers, is lessened—not heightened—when the FISC acts with the \nexpress authorization and direction of Congress. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635, 72 \nS.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (“[The Constitution] enjoins upon its branches separateness \nbut interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity.”). \n \n33  These two inquiries necessarily overlap because the closer courts hew to their “central mission,” the less they will \n  “trench upon the prerogatives of another Branch.” Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. 647. \n80 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n \n34  In making this comparison, we do not suggest that the FISC’s Section 702 functions are strictly analogous to the \n  issuance of search warrants, Title III wiretap orders, or traditional FISA warrants, all of which may issue only after \nparticularized judicial findings that applicable statutory and constitutional requirements are met with respect to the \nspecific facts of the search or surveillance to be conducted. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 \nL.Ed.2d  527  (1983)  (holding  that  a  warrant  may  issue  only  when  probable  cause  exists  under  the \n“totality-of-the-circumstances”); Donovan, 429 U.S. at 428, 97 S.Ct. 658 (“[A] wiretap application [under Title III] \nmust name an individual if the Government has probable cause to believe that the individual is engaged in the \ncriminal  activity  under  investigation  and  expects  to  intercept  the  individual’s  conversations  over  the  target \ntelephone.”); United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 128-31 (2d Cir. 2010) (reviewing on the facts of the case \nwhether a FISA warrant properly complied with the requirements that the “executive ... is in good faith pursuing \nforeign intelligence gathering,” and that probable cause existed that the individual surveilled was a foreign agent). \n \n35  As one national security law scholar has noted, “there are few, if any, feasible alternatives to the FISC’s [Section 702] \n  role,” and “[o]ther potential forums for review, such as an executive agency or an Article I court ... do not possess \nthe independence and institutional credibility that an Article III court commands.” Peter Margulies, Searching for the \nFederal Judicial Power: Article III and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 85 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 800, 808 \n(2017). \n \n36  Mr. Muhtorov poses two hypotheticals. First, the Denver Police Department asks a federal court whether proposed \n  use of force polices are constitutional. Second, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) asks a federal \ncourt whether proposed agency procedures for airport screening are reasonable. Aplt. Reply Br. at 24. The dissent \npresents a similar hypothetical. Dissent at 685. \nThe Article III question here is different. Under Section 702, the government is legally powerless to conduct \nwarrantless  foreign  surveillance  previously  carried  out  under  the  TSP  without  the  FISC’s  authorization.  The \ngovernment’s Section 702 orders to electronic service providers would be void ab initio. Criminal defendants would \nbe entitled to suppression under 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e) without the need for determining whether the surveillance \nviolated the Fourth Amendment. In the hypotheticals, the courts would dispense “advice” with no legal effect on the \nability of the Denver Police Department or the TSA to, respectively, use force or screen people. Were the Denver \nPolice Department or TSA to act without judicial authorization, their actions would not be void ab initio. \n \n37  Because we conclude Section 702 is constitutional, we need not address the proper remedy were we to hold \n  otherwise. The dissent would not invalidate the entire Section 702 program even if the FISC’s annual review violates \nArticle III. Dissent at 685. But if Section 702 annual reviews are unconstitutional because the FISC lacks Article III \njurisdiction, then surveillance conducted under that section is unlawful under the statute, and the program would \neffectively be invalidated. The dissent instead proposes “that the Fourth Amendment reasonableness determination \nbe accomplished de novo when an actual case is presented to an Article III court.” Id. Yet this is precisely what \ncourts—including the district court and this court in the present case—already do when a criminal defendant seeks \nsuppression of Section 702-derived evidence. \n \n38  In making this request, Mr. Muhtorov does not seek discovery of the fruits of the traditional FISA and Section 702 \n81 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n  surveillance. As explained below, the government has complied with its discovery obligations. \n \n39  Section 1806(f) applies to Section 702 as well as traditional FISA. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881e(a)(1) (“Information acquired \n  from an acquisition conducted under [Section 702] shall be deemed to be information acquired from an electronic \nsurveillance pursuant to [Title] I for purposes of section 1806 of this title, except [in circumstances not relevant \nhere].”). \n \n40  Because § 1806(f) requires in camera and ex parte review by the district court before deciding whether to order \n  disclosure, our analysis requires us to conduct our own “comprehensive review” of the materials “to determine \nwhether the district court acted within its discretion.” Ali, 799 F.3d at 1022. We have done so. \n \n41  We have hinted the answer is no: “Suppression hearings do not determine a defendant’s guilt or punishment, yet \n  Brady rests on the idea that due process is violated when the withheld evidence is material either to guilt or to \npunishment.” Lee Vang Lor, 706 F.3d at 1256 n.2 (quotations and citation omitted). \n \n42  Our  determination  that  the  government’s  Section  702  surveillance  did  not  violate  Mr.  Muhtorov’s  Fourth \n  Amendment rights turned largely on questions of law. Had the district court, or we, concluded that the surveillance \nof Mr. Muhtorov failed to comply with Section 702’s minimization and targeting requirements, he would have a \nstronger Brady argument. \n \n43  Apart from his Brady-based argument, Mr. Muhtorov cites to Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 \n  L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), to argue he was entitled to “information that is relevant and helpful” to his argument, see Aplt. \nBr. at 64. Roviaro provided that courts should determine whether to order disclosure of information about a \nconfidential informant by “balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual’s \nright to prepare his defense,” taking into account “the particular circumstances of [the] case, ... the crime charged, \nthe possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer’s testimony, and other relevant factors.” Roviaro, \n353 U.S. at 62, 77 S.Ct. 623. Roviaro is far removed from this case, and its balancing test does not favor Mr. \nMuhtorov  because  the  “strong  public  interest  in  furthering  effective  law  enforcement,”  United  States  v. \nMendoza-Salgado, 964 F.2d 993, 1000 (10th Cir. 1992), and Congress’s determination that disclosure under FISA is \nthe exception, not the rule, see 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f); Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 129, outweigh any general interest that \nMr. Muhtorov might have in the materials to prepare his suppression motions. \n \n44  Franks was a Fourth Amendment case, not a due process case. We assume without deciding that Franks may \n  provide a basis for a defendant to obtain “discovery or disclosure” under 50 U.S.C. § 1806(g). \n \n45  A Franks challenge would not succeed here. In response to such a challenge in the FISA context, “the judge makes \n  the additional determination, based on full access to all classified materials and the defense’s proffer of its version \n82 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nof events, of whether it’s possible to determine the validity of the Franks challenge without disclosure of any of the \nclassified materials to the defense.” United States v. Daoud, 755 F.3d 479, 484 (7th Cir. 2014). Here, the district \ncourt found there was “no need to order a Franks hearing” with respect to the traditional FISA surveillance. ROA, \nVol. I at 482. We agree. And nothing in the record provides any basis to suspect that the Section 702 application \nmaterials contained any false statement, let alone one made “knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard \nfor the truth.” Franks, 438 U.S. at 155, 98 S.Ct. 2674. \n \n46  To the extent Mr. Muhtorov suggests that the district court could have disclosed the classified FISA materials only to \n  Mr. Muhtorov’s counsel, he points to no supporting authority. As the Seventh Circuit noted, though unlikely that \nlawyers would brazenly publicize classified information in violation of federal law, “they might in their zeal to defend \ntheir client, to whom they owe a duty of candid communication, or misremembering what is classified and what not, \ninadvertently say things that would provide clues to classified material.” Daoud, 755 F.3d at 484. It was not error for \nthe district court to decline to disclose information to Mr. Muhtorov’s counsel. \n \n47  Though Mr. Muhtorov describes the surveillance techniques as “novel,” he does not explain what he means by \n  “novel.” It is thus unclear on appeal what Mr. Muhtorov sought with this request in the district court, which borders \non inadequate appellate briefing. Out of an abundance of caution, we construe his request as covering all \nsurveillance techniques the government may have used during its investigation. \n \n48  Mr. Muhtorov notes that courts have held aspects of these last two techniques to be illegal. See Carpenter v. United \n  States, ––– U.S. ––––, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2223, 201 L.Ed.2d 507 (2018) (warrantless collection of cell-site location \ninformation violates the Fourth Amendment); ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 810-21 (2d Cir. 2015) (PATRIOT Act § \n215 does not authorize the government’s bulk call data collection program). \n \n49  This challenge differs from his FISA disclosure challenge in that he does not seek the applications that justified the \n  government’s surveillance but instead the nature of the specific surveillance techniques used as well as evidence \nderived therefrom. \n \n50  “[E]lectronic, mechanical, or other device” means “any device or apparatus which can be used to intercept a wire, \n  oral, or electronic communication.” 18 U.S.C. § 2510(5). \n \n51  Courts have applied this principle in Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) cases. See Wilner v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, 592 \n  F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (discussing the permissibility of a Glomar response in FOIA cases, in which the agency may \nrefuse to confirm or deny the existence of records because answering the FOIA inquiry would cause harm); see \nPhillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (allowing the CIA to claim that the “existence or nonexistence of \nthe requested records [pertaining to an oceanic research vessel called the Hughes Glomar Explorer] was itself a \nclassified fact exempt from disclosure under ... FOIA”). \n83 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n \n52  Stellar Wind was a surveillance program based on Congress’s 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force \n  (“AUMF”). See ACLU v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, 925 F.3d 576, 586 (2d Cir. 2019). \n \n53  The Stellar Wind surveillance program is not relevant because the record lacks evidence to suggest that the \n  surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov was part of that program. \n \n54  The dissent contends our Sixth Amendment and Fourth Amendment analyses fail to account for Mr. Muhtorov’s lack \n  of access to the classified record. See Dissent at 668–70 & nn.12, 15 (Sixth Amendment); id. at 674–75 & nn.22, 25 \n(Fourth Amendment). We disagree. Although Mr. Muhtorov’s lack of access to the classified record makes this case \ndifferent from an ordinary criminal case and understandably caused the defense frustration, the district court did \nnot err in denying disclosure under prevailing law. And we have given Mr. Muhtorov’s constitutional challenges \nappropriate consideration in light of the circumstances. Moreover, we note that the dissent does not question the \ndistrict court’s denial of his requests for the government’s application materials for traditional FISA and Section 702 \nsurveillance or for disclosure of possible novel surveillance methods. \n \n55  As explained above, the government had filed, in February 2012, notice that it “intend[ed] to offer into evidence ... \n  information obtained and derived from electronic surveillance and physical search conducted pursuant to [FISA], as \namended, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811 [governing electronic surveillance], 1821-1829 [governing physical searches].” \nROA, Vol. I at 220. Mr. Muhtorov’s motion to suppress traditional FISA evidence was denied in September 2012. The \ngovernment did not indicate in the February 2012 notice that it would use evidence derived from Section 702 \nsurveillance. The record does not explain why the government filed the Section 702 notice when it did. The dissent \nnonetheless attempts to speculate. See Dissent at 663 n.2. \n \n56  Mr. Muhtorov did not end up calling Mr. Jumaev as a witness at trial. \n \n \n57  The conduct underlying Mr. Jumaev’s conviction was even more straightforward, consisting of a single $300 \n  payment to Mr. Muhtorov, to be forwarded to the IJU. \n \n58  Ignoring this passage from Barker, the dissent faults us for considering whether the length of discovery was due to a \n  deliberate attempt to delay the trial, negligence, or a valid reason. Dissent at 665 n.7. Although good faith alone \nmay not preclude a speedy trial violation, see Seltzer, 595 F.3d at 1179, bad faith government delay can weigh \n“heavily” in favor of a violation, as Barker instructs, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182. See also Doggett, 505 U.S. at 656, \n112 S.Ct. 2686 (“[O]fficial bad faith in causing delay will be weighed heavily against the government.”). \n \n59  The government also gave these justifications for continuances under the STA, all but two of which Mr. Muhtorov \n \n84 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \ndid not oppose. \n \n60  Although document production may have ceased during these times, the record shows that work was ongoing \n  behind the scenes, particularly with respect to translations. A gap in discovery production does not equate to a lack \nof government diligence. \n \n61  In its oral ruling, the district court referred to “defense counsel” rather than government counsel. The context \n  makes clear that the district court intended to refer to government counsel. \n \n62  Discovery in Mr. Jumaev’s case continued until February 2018. \n \n \n63  Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, the government did not merely “incant[ ] ... the phrase ‘national security’ ” to \n  justify the time it took to bring Mr. Muhtorov to trial. See Dissent at 667. If it had, we would reject a bare invocation \nof national security to justify the length of the pretrial period. The Second Circuit has allowed for “national security \n... [to] justify pretrial delay.” United States v. Ghailani, 733 F.3d 29, 46 (2d Cir. 2013). But here, there is no indication \nthat national security would have been compromised had Mr. Muhtorov been tried sooner—for example, by \nhindering the federal government’s efforts to prevent a terrorist attack. \n \n64  In light of the volume of communications involved, these requests were hardly “garden variety,” as the dissent \n  contends. Dissent at 662 n.1. \n \n65  The dissent is thus incorrect that he requested translation only after September 2016. See Dissent at 662 n.1. \n \n \n66  At one point, the district court stated that it could “only surmise ... that the translations were not done as soon as \n  they could have been.” ROA, Vol. XII at 552. The court added that it “d[idn’t] know that for a fact,” and “[w]hat I do \nknow, for a fact, is that the reasons for the length of time this is taking are palpable and legitimate reasons.” Id. \nThus, though the court observed translation needs slowed the pace of discovery, it did not find the government \nintentionally or negligently delayed the translation process. \n \n67  The defense later argued: \n \nThe recordings are gibberish and meaningless to the defense unless they are translated. Unless they are \ntranslated, defense counsel cannot discern whether they contain inculpatory statements that the government will \nintroduce in its case in chief, or whether they contain exculpatory statements helpful to the defense. It is \ntherefore necessary that they be translated by the government.” \n85 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nROA, Vol. V at 526-27 (emphasis added). \n \n68  For example, as Mr. Jumaev pointed out in his opening brief, he “had found significant exculpatory evidence that \n  could only have been discovered through a full translation of recorded conversations.” Jumaev Aplt. Br. at 18. He \nalso recognized that the government “could not present classified materials to the court without also preparing \ntranslations of the classified materials, because neither the court nor the government lawyers could speak the \nrelevant languages.” Id. at 48. There is no indication that the lawyers in this case were fluent in Russian, Uzbek, or \nTajik, let alone all three. \n \n69  The dissent erroneously states that “the trial court sanctioned the government for discovery abuse which directly \n  caused at least one year of delay.” Dissent at 661; see also id. at 664 (“The district court sanctioned the government \nfor this belated discovery production [on the eve of Mr. Jumaev’s trial], which occurred well after the discovery \ndeadline.”). As explained in our separate Jumaev opinion, the district court imposed only two sanctions on the \ngovernment: (1) it precluded the admission of evidence collected for counts 5 and 6 of the third superseding \nindictment; and (2) it instructed the jury about “the information that was belatedly disclosed by the government \nand not elicited during [the] deposition of [Ilkohm Sobirov].” Jumaev, slip op. at 9-10 (quotations omitted). The \ncourt did not attribute a time of delay to the government’s conduct in either instance, and neither involved delay in \nproduction of the voluminous communications. \n \n70  The dissent’s reliance on the district court’s comments about the slow pace of discovery is therefore misplaced. No \n  one disputes that discovery took a long time. But the question is whether the reason discovery took a long time was \ndue to a “deliberate attempt to delay the trial” or “negligence” as opposed to a “valid reason” that justifies delay. \nSee Barker, 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182. \n \n71  The dissent’s suggestion that the “admittedly difficult discovery tasks” could have been completed “in the first year \n  following  [Mr.]  Muhtorov’s  arrest,”  Dissent  at  666,  strains  credulity.  No  one—not  Mr.  Muhtorov,  not  the \ngovernment, and not the district court—believed the case could go to trial that quickly when the prosecution began \nin 2012. Mr. Muhtorov did not object to most of the government’s requests for continuances, and he sought broad \ndiscovery early on. \n \n72  Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion otherwise, we have “critically assess[ed]” the government’s account of \n  discovery logistics and have found ample support for it in the record. See Dissent at 665. \n \n73  The dissent seems to assume that anything that could have caused delay should count against the government in \n  the second Barker factor analysis. See Dissent at 663 n.2, 667 n.10. But, as explained above, the Section 702 filing \nand the third superseding indictment did not delay the trial date. \n \n86 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n74  Defense counsel moved for access to classified pleadings and security clearances. The district court denied the \n  motion after full briefing. Whether or not defense counsel were “privy to the classified record” does not excuse Mr. \nMuhtorov’s waiver of the issue in his appellate briefing on speedy trial or “provide[ ] the basis for asserting this \nargument on appeal.” Dissent at 668 n.12. \n \n75  Equally speculative is the dissent’s comment that “the delay in beginning the [CIPA] § 4 process was a strategic \n  decision, either to compel a guilty plea or out of an expectation that [Mr.] Muhtorov would plead guilty.” Dissent at \n666 n.9. \n \n76  On appeal, Mr. Muhtorov does not present an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Nor would we address this \n  argument or claim if he had. “[A] defendant must generally raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in a \ncollateral proceeding, not on direct review.” United States v. Porter, 405 F.3d 1136, 1144 (10th Cir. 2005); see also \nUnited States v. Galloway, 56 F.3d 1239, 1242 (10th Cir. 1995) (en banc). \n \n77  On appeal from the dismissal, this court called “the length of delay ... troubling,” but affirmed the dismissal without \n  prejudice for “substantially the same reasons” stated by the district court. Muhtorov v. Choate, 697 F. App’x 608, \n609 (10th Cir. 2017) (unpublished). \n \n78  Mr. Muhtorov offers no authority that his objections to the slow pace of discovery productions are akin to the \n  assertion of a speedy trial right. \n \n79  Although we are under no obligation to consider pro se motions by a represented defendant, see United States v. \n  Dunbar, 718 F.3d 1268, 1278 (10th Cir. 2013), pro se filings in which a defendant asserts the speedy trial right are \nrelevant to the third Barker factor, see United States v. Battis, 589 F.3d 673, 681 (3d Cir. 2009) (noting a counseled \ndefendant’s pro se letter and motion “indicate[d] that [he] was concerned that his trial happen promptly”); Tigano, \n880 F.3d at 618 (“[A] defendant’s assertion of his own right to a speedy trial—even though ignored or contravened \nby his counsel—is the relevant fact for purposes of Sixth Amendment analysis.”). \n \n80  This case highlights the “awkward position” defense counsel often find themselves in. See Barker, 407 U.S. at 527, \n  92 S.Ct. 2182. Faced with voluminous discovery and the responsibility to a client to make non-frivolous motions \nunder FISA and Section 702, defense counsel here was undoubtedly “willing to tolerate some delay because [they \nfound] it reasonable and helpful in preparing [their] own case.” See id. In those circumstances, Barker does not \nrequire a “pro forma demand [for a speedy trial] made immediately after appointment of counsel.” See id. at 528, \n92 S.Ct. 2182. \n \n81  Both the first and fourth Barker factors involve “presumptive prejudice,” but the analysis differs between the two. \n  See United States v. Jackson, 473 F.3d 660, 664 (6th Cir. 2007) (cautioning against conflating prejudice at the first \n87 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nand fourth factors). \n \n82  As the Supreme Court has explained, the speedy trial right detaches upon conviction. See Betterman, 136 S. Ct. at \n  1613. Thus, the relevant period of incarceration is preconviction incarceration, not pretrial incarceration. But \nbecause most of the cases talk about “pretrial” incarceration, we do as well when discussing prejudice. \n \n83  Mr. Muhtorov never made such an offer. \n \n \n84  The  government  notes  that  Mr.  Muhtorov’s  presentence  report  shows  that  his  religious  preferences  were \n  respected, and he had no serious problems when detained. But Mr. Muhtorov does not argue that jail personnel \ndiscriminated against him. Rather, he alleges that his status as a non-English speaking Uzbek- and Russian-speaking \nMuslim made his stay in jail more difficult. \n \n85  Unpublished cases cited in this opinion are not binding precedent, but we may consider them for their persuasive \n  value. See Fed. R. App. 32.1(a); 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A). \n \n86  The government objects that details about his first two months are not part of the record, but we may take judicial \n  notice of district court filings containing this information. See Dist. Ct. Doc. 56 at 10. \n \n87  The government also points out that the prosecutor acknowledged Mr. Muhtorov’s human rights work during \n  closing argument, when he said that Mr. Muhtorov “rejected his prior human rights worker self, and he chose an \nentirely new path, radical Islamic jihadism.” Aplee. Br. at 80-81 (quoting ROA, Vol. XX at 1553). But evidence “has \nforce beyond any linear scheme of reasoning, and as its pieces come together a narrative gains momentum, with \npower not only to support conclusions but to sustain the willingness of jurors to draw the inferences, whatever they \nmay be, necessary to reach an honest verdict.” Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 188, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 \nL.Ed.2d  574  (1997).  In  other  words,  although  the  government’s  closing  statement  may  have  weakened  the \nprejudice, it did so only slightly, because Mr. Muhtorov had the right, not simply to put certain facts before the jury, \nbut to paint a broad narrative picture about his own life. \n \n88  Though the six-and-a-half-year delay in this case was significant, courts have found that similar or longer delays do \n  not warrant dismissal of the indictment. See, e.g., Hicks, 779 F.3d at 1169-70 (finding a delay of five-and-a-half years \nduring which time the defendant was incarcerated did not violate the Sixth Amendment); Tillman v. Kansas, 274 F. \nApp’x 706, 707-08 (10th Cir. 2008) (unpublished) (finding a state court’s determination that a nine-year delay did \nnot violate the defendant’s speedy trial right was not an unreasonable application of Barker); United States v. \nDuran-Gomez, 984 F.3d 366, 380-81 (5th Cir. 2020) (reversing the district court’s dismissal of the indictment on \nspeedy trial grounds when nine years elapsed between the indictment and the district court’s dismissal, during \nwhich time the defendant was incarcerated), cert. denied, ––– U.S. ––––, 142 S.Ct. 133, 211 L.Ed.2d 45 (U.S. Oct. 4, \n88 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n2021); Boyer v. Vannoy, 863 F.3d 428, 445 (5th Cir. 2017) (finding a state court’s determination that a seven-year \ndelay did not violate the defendant’s speedy trial right was not an unreasonable application of Barker); United \nStates v. Young, 657 F.3d 408, 420 (6th Cir. 2011) (finding that an eleven-year delay, while “atypical,” was “not \nunconstitutional”); United States v. Zedner, 401 F.3d 36, 48-49 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding a seven-year delay between \nindictment and trial did not violate the Sixth Amendment), rev’d on other grounds by 547 U.S. 489, 126 S.Ct. 1976, \n164 L.Ed.2d 749 (2006); United States v. Gibson, 353 F.3d 21, 28 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (assuming that a speedy trial claim \ncould be asserted for a delay between conviction and sentence, and finding that a seven-year delay was not a \nconstitutional violation); United States v. Saglimbene, 471 F.2d 16, 18 (2d Cir. 1972) (finding a six-year delay did not \nviolate the Sixth Amendment); Page v. Lockyer, 200 F. App’x 727, 728 (9th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (finding a \nsix-year delay did not warrant habeas relief on speedy-trial grounds). \nThe Barker analysis is fact-intensive, and each of these cases differs from this case. But they suggest that lengthy \ndelays do not ineluctably compel dismissal of the indictment. \n \n89  We grant Mr. Muhtorov’s motion to file a supplemental reply brief. \n \n \n1  My colleagues excuse the trial delay by pointing to “the vast and multi-faceted discovery process—fueled by Mr. \n  Muhtorov’s exhaustive discovery demands that enmeshed the parties and the court in CIPA and translation \nnecessities” as the cause of the trial’s delay until after January 2018. (Op. at 649.) These “exhaustive discovery \ndemands,” however, were garden variety requests under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b) for discovery of \nrelevant statements of a defendant that were within the possession, custody, or control of the government. Their \nvolume does not transform them into the exotic, or render unexpected the steps required of the government to \nproceed to trial, steps to be anticipated even before the indictment issued. Seeking to avoid waste “of government \nresources,” the defense did not request an order to compel the government to translate the discovery. Instead, the \ndefense merely sought translations of statements which had already been accomplished by the government \nbecause “the time needed to have already translated statements re-translated by the defense causes delay for no \ngood  reason.”  Only  after  the  September  2016  “discovery  dump”  of  tens  of  thousands  of  untranslated \ncommunications six months before the first scheduled trial did the defense request the government to translate the \ndiscovery material belatedly provided. See infra at 664–65. \nIt is on this post-September 2016 request that the majority premises its determination that “the time taken to \ntranslate materials was needed for the benefit of Mr. Muhtorov and the preparation of his defense.” (Op. at 645, \n646 n.67.) To the contrary, it was the government’s decision to translate the defendants’ recorded statements prior \nto providing them to the defense in order to evaluate them under CIPA that caused the translation delays. This \ndecision significantly contributed to the trial delay. At the origin of the case in May 2012, the government \nrepresented that it could provide the court the “finite number” of items that would have to remain classified \nbecause of sources and methods, allowing the court to begin its CIPA evaluation at that time. Yet, despite these \nrepresentations, the government did not begin that process until after the November 2015 denial of the defendants’ \nmotion to suppress, and did not produce significant discovery until September 2016. The defense could not \nindependently translate information that the government had not yet provided. \nAs is clear from review of the record and the government’s assertions in May 2012, the vast majority of discovery \ninformation was classified because of the sources and methods by which communications were collected, not their \ncontent. And, as discussed infra at 672, it was the specific protective technique unilaterally chosen by the \ngovernment that resulted in the lack of significant discovery production prior to September 2016. Such decisions are \n89 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nweighed against the government. \n \n2  The District Court pointed out, however, the confluence of the government’s belated § 702 notice on October 25, \n  2013 and the 2013 Snowden leaks, recognizing that: \n[U]ntil the Snowden leaks in 2013, the American public was led to believe that the government did not query or \nuse FAA-acquired surveillance against non-targeted U.S. persons. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l, USA [568 U.S. 398], \n133 S. Ct. 1138 [185 L.Ed.2d 264] (2013). The belated notice in this case was part of the Snowden fallout and the \nrevelation, post-Clapper, that the Executive Branch does, in fact, use FAA-acquired information to investigate U.S. \npersons for suspected criminal activity, and that it intends to use it against Mr. Muhtorov here. \nThat the evidence in this case originated from § 702 surveillance was not a surprise to the government; it formed \nthe basis of the multi-year investigation of Muhtorov prior to his arrest. I need not speculate to conclude that the \ngovernment’s complete failure to explain this 21-month delay does not establish necessity under United States v. \nSeltzer, which placed the burden on the government to explain why delay was necessary in a particular case. 595 \nF.3d 1170, 1178 (10th Cir. 2010)). Given the government’s duty to “[e]nsure that the trial was consistent with due \nprocess,” this delay weighs heavily against the government. See Barker, 407 U.S. at 527, 92 S.Ct. 2182. \n \n3  Exacerbating this behavior, the government was aware of the district court’s intent to deny Muhtorov’s motion to \n  suppress as early as June 17, 2015, when the district court gave an oral ruling from the bench detailing its proposed \ndenial. Even if we were to accept, which I do not, that it was acceptable for the government to delay the CIPA § 4 \nprocess until after the motion to suppress was denied, there is no conceivable explanation for this extra five-month \ndelay. \n \n4  The majority agrees that the government provided no discovery for one year of this pretrial period from September \n  2014 to April 2015, and October 2015 to March 2016. (Op. at 642.) They excuse the resultant delay. \n \n5  My colleagues parse the district court’s response to this eve-of-trial discovery production. (Op. at 647 n.69.) Yet \n  again they ignore the context. After the district court denied the defendants’ motion for dismissal for denial of a \nspeedy trial, it informed the defense that although it would not dismiss the case, it would grant a continuance to \nremedy  the  due  process  violations  arising  from  the  late  production  of  material  evidence.  As  the  majority \nacknowledges, the district court did sanction the government for this late production, precluding its use of the \ninformation in their case in chief, and while the government’s conduct did not “involve[ ] delay in production of the \nvoluminous  communications”  (id.),  that  was  because  more  than  four-and-one-half  years’  delay  had  already \noccurred. The government was sanctioned for its eve-of-trial production, and that conduct directly resulted in an \nadditional one-year delay in trial, forcing the defendants to trade one constitutional right for another and further \neroding their right to a speedy trial. See infra. at 670. \n \n6  In analyzing the remaining Barker factors, the majority concludes that two factors—assertion-of-the-right and \n  prejudice-to-the-defendant—weigh in Muhtorov’s favor and another—the length of the delay—strongly weighs in \nhis favor. I agree, although I would weigh the prejudice factor more heavily in his favor because of the oppressive \n90 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nnature of his pretrial incarceration. Muhtorov was denied in-contact visits for six years. \n \n7  The majority seems to misunderstand this fundamental aspect of the speedy trial analysis. It repeatedly emphasizes \n  the lack of bad faith or negligence on the part of the government in concluding that the second Barker factor favors \nthe government. (See, e.g., Op. at 658–60.) My colleagues go so far as to claim that “the question is whether the \nreason discovery took a long time was due to a deliberate attempt to delay the trial or negligence as opposed to a \nvalid reason that justifies delay.” (Op. at 647 n.70 (quotations omitted).) But the absence of bad faith does not \nresolve the issue as the majority’s repeated emphasis implies. Although bad faith is weighed more heavily against \nthe government, and is often dispositive of the issue, a speedy trial violation may exist “even when there is no \nevidence that the government intentionally delayed the case for the explicit purpose of gaining some advantage.” \nSeltzer, 595 F.3d at 1179. Neutral factors can weigh against the government. At no point do my colleagues engage \nwith Seltzer’s holding that it is the government’s burden to show that pre-trial delays are necessary under the \ncircumstances. See id. at 1178. They merely summarily conclude that CIPA compliance and the challenge of \ntranslation were “valid reason[s]” for the six-and-one-half-year discovery period (Op. at 645, 646, 648), without \nrecognition that these processes were solely within the control of the government. In my estimation, the record \namply demonstrates that the government was not diligent in either task. As the majority acknowledges, “factors \nwithin its control” are to be weighed against the government. (Op. at 640.) \n \n8  Confusingly, the majority asserts that the government was diligent in conducting its CIPA evaluation. (Op. at \n  644–45.) I agree with the majority that this “process takes time.” (Op. at 645.) In this case it took approximately nine \nmonths. Although the majority attaches great weight to the filing of procedural § 4 motions in 2012 (id.), the \nclassified record unambiguously demonstrates that the government did not begin its substantive CIPA evaluation \nuntil after the district court denied Muhtorov’s second motion to suppress. I cannot agree that this record shows \ngovernmental diligence. \n \n9  The record suggests that the delay in beginning the § 4 process was a strategic decision, either to compel a guilty \n  plea or out of an expectation that Muhtorov would plead guilty. The district court itself commented on the \ncorrelation between the failure of earlier plea negotiations and the resultant discovery disclosure. Although our \nsystem has become “for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,” Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. 134, 143, \n132 S.Ct. 1399, 182 L.Ed.2d 379 (2012), the government is not entitled to a plea, nor is it entitled to avoid its \nfundamental discovery obligations in order to coerce a plea from a defendant incarcerated and awaiting trial. \n \n10  Waving away the delay caused by the government’s discretionary decisions, the majority boldly states that these \n  choices “did not extend the pretrial period.” (Op. at 644.) Rather, they claim the date of the trial was due to “the \nvast and multi-faceted discovery process” which happened “before, during, and after those events.” (Id.) I am \nperplexed. It is simple arithmetic that choosing a course of action that lengthens and delays the discovery process \ncauses the discovery process to take longer. An end to the discovery process is required in order to proceed to trial. \nTherefore, delays in required discovery production ipso facto delay the trial. \n \n11  FISA and the FAA contain the same fundamental due process limitations on government protection of classified \n \n91 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \ninformation when prosecuting criminal defendants. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f), 1825(g). \n \n12  The majority views this issue as waived (Op. at 644–45, 649 n.74), but the defense was not privy to the classified \n  record which provides the basis for asserting this argument on appeal. Specifically, as to the prejudice and delay \nresulting from this decision, to hold an issue waived when defense counsel is denied access to the evidence \nnecessary to advance an argument is both unfair and directly contrary to our duty to stand in the shoes of defense \ncounsel in this case. See United States v. Amawi, 695 F.3d 457, 471 (6th Cir. 2012). The majority characterizes as \nspeculative my evaluation that the governmental decisions to oppose cleared counsel and the reasons for its delay \nin commencing the CIPA § 4 process caused a delay of the trial. (Op. at 650 & n.75.) My inability to quote the \nclassified record in support of this evaluation in this unclassified opinion, however, does not render it speculative. \nThis is particularly so in light of the government’s failure to provide any explanation for the 46-month delay in \nbeginning its CIPA § 4 process. These conclusions are fully supported in the classified record. \nAs it grappled with the competing interests of justice and national security, the district court suggested that having a \ncadre of cleared defense counsel available who would have full access to classified information would make it easier \nfor district courts to navigate these cases. I agree and would join in the district court’s suggestion that such a \nstandby list of cleared counsel should be authorized. \n \n13  See United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 655, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984) (“The very premise of our \n  adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate \nobjective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free. It is that very premise that underlies and gives \nmeaning to the Sixth Amendment. It is meant to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process.” (cleaned up)); \nsee also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (“[A] fair trial is one in \nwhich evidence subject to adversarial testing is presented to an impartial tribunal for resolution of issues defined in \nadvance of the proceeding.”); United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 230-31, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) \n(“We have elected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues before a \ncourt of law. The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive. \nThe ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative \npresentation of the facts.” (quotation omitted)). \n \n14  Early in this case, the government characterized the issue of clearing defense counsel as “irrelevant” at the time \n  because ex parte CIPA § 4 review would still be required to establish the relevance of the information and defense \ncounsel’s “need-to-know” before they could access classified information. In May 2012, it categorically stated that \nthe FISA information was and would remain classified and “be handled in an ex parte in-camera procedure and will \nnot be produced.” The district court recognized that it was not a prosecutorial determination by the government to \nlimit contextual information to the defense that was the issue but the prosecution’s inability to extract it from the \nintelligence agencies “that don’t want to disclose anything.” Nonetheless, it is the government that has the \nresponsibility to promptly proceed to trial and show the necessity for delays. Delays resulting from internal \ngovernmental disagreement and bureaucratic disputes appropriately weigh against the government. \n \n15  In a January 2016 CIPA ex parte hearing, at which point the defendants had been incarcerated for four years, the \n  district court excoriated the government for the lack of discovery provided to the defendants, and declared that it \nwould not conduct a “Kafkaesque” trial, in which the defendants were unaware of the charges they faced or the \n92 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nevidence against them. I agree that the government must sometimes make a choice between the utmost protection \nof classified information and the prosecution of a defendant in a case that implicates national security. If the \nunderlying evidence for a charge is so sensitive that the government cannot abide by the Speedy Trial Clause, it is \nfree to forego that particular prosecution. \n \n16  The government’s production was limited. As the majority notes, it produced only 1000 calls and 4718 pages of \n  discovery between April 2012 and March 2013, and in the entire four years between filing the case and the end of \nAugust 2016, the government had produced only 6270 pages of written discovery, including the 1000 recorded \nphone conversations, and copies of the computers and phones seized from the defendants at their arrests. Thus, in \nthe second through fourth year of Muhtorov’s incarceration, the government produced only an additional 1552 \npages of discovery, and produced no discovery at all for one year of this period. I cannot agree that this record \ndemonstrates diligence in discovery production. \n \n17  I do not fault the trial court for this embarrassing delay. In March 2017, the district court stated that much of this \n  delay was “attributable to an overlapping muddle of translation issues, tactical decisionmaking, and classified \ninformation, ... which resulted in an opaque and painstakingly slow discovery process, one which has surely inured \nto Defendants’ detriment.” Despite what the court described as the “herculean” task of reviewing thousands of \ncommunications and other information generated in the investigation and prosecution of Muhtorov, the court \nnoted that there “have been delays and obfuscation in the disclosure of the materials, not all of which have been \nbeyond the control of the government,” and “translation and evaluation for Brady material has often taken a back \nseat to the search for inculpatory material and that the government’s standard for what constitutes Brady material \nhas not always aligned with mine.” As described above, on March 13, 2017, immediately prior to denying the \ndefendants’ speedy trial motion, the district court stated it was “gravely concerned about the delays and the \nslow—and maybe even deliberately slow—pace” of the government’s translation effort. \n \n18  These charges added claims related to Jumaev’s son and an alleged conspiracy with Muhtorov and others to provide \n  his services as “material support for a terrorist conspiracy to kill persons abroad” via Sheikh Buhoriy’s madrassa in \nIstanbul, Turkey. \n \n19  This nine-month delay was followed immediately by the one-year delay caused by the government’s eve-of-trial \n  disclosures to Jumaev. Because Muhtorov was required to be tried after Jumaev, Muhtorov’s trial was delayed until \nMay 2018 (an additional two months) as a direct result of the government’s belated discovery, raising the total \nmonths of government-caused delay from these two decisions to 23 months for Muhtorov. \n \n20  The majority comments that I do not “question the district court’s denial of [Muhtorov’s] requests for the \n  government’s application materials for traditional FISA and Section 702 surveillance or for disclosure of possible \nnovel surveillance methods.” (Op. at 633 n.54.) Such a lack of questioning does not arise from agreement. Rather, it \nproceeds from my conclusion that the government’s denial of a speedy trial controls this case. Moreover, as I am in \ndissent, silence does not constitute agreement. I choose not to engage in a tit for tat with the majority as to the \nremainder of their analysis. \n93 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n \n21  This comment is not to disparage the district court’s valiant attempt to perform this function, only to highlight that \n  shoehorning responsibilities that are at odds with our traditional mode of doing justice into the trial of a criminal \ncase creates significant difficulties, not the least of which is the inadequacy of the record on appeal. \n \n22  Any other approach would make a mockery of our criminal justice system. We cannot require a defendant to \n  specifically challenge the use of certain evidence when he does not have access to that very evidence to investigate \nits origins fully or to test its admissibility. To conclude that a defendant may mount a derivative evidence challenge \nto the use of § 702-derived evidence only if he has access to the evidence—which he does not—would transform \nthe Fourth Amendment inquiry into a dark comedy. \n \n23  As we recently explained, “[t]he exclusionary rule generally applied in Fourth Amendment cases requires courts to \n  suppress not only evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal search or seizure but also evidence later \ndiscovered and found to be derivative of an illegality.” United States v. Suggs, 998 F.3d 1125, 1141 (10th Cir. 2021) \n(cleaned up). As is particularly relevant in this case, “this so-called ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine does not \ndemand a particularly tight causal chain between the illegal search and the discovery of the evidence sought to be \nsuppressed.” Id. at 1142. \n \n24  The majority accepts the government’s unsupported assertion that no upstream collection occurred in this case. The \n  record  evidence  does  not  disclose  whether  “upstream”  collection  was  involved  in  Muhtorov’s  investigation, \nalthough the prosecution at least purported to provide a response denying its involvement before the district court. \nThis assertion does not amount to evidence. However, because the FBI does not receive unminimized upstream \ncollection or have access to databases containing this information, its involvement is less likely. Access to minimized \nand subsequently unmasked upstream information, however, remains unresolved in this case, as no evidence in the \nrecord excludes it. See Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, Report on the Surveillance Program Operated \nPursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 7 (July 2, 2014) (PCLOB Report). \n \n25  My  colleagues  accuse  me  of  “join[ing]  Mr.  Muhtorov  in  speculat[ion]”  and  engaging  in  “conjecture  about \n  extra-record occurrences.” (Op. at 591 n.12, 594 n.14.) These comments demonstrate that the majority pays mere \nlip service to the requirement that we “place ourselves in the shoes of defense counsel ... and act with a view to \ntheir interests.” Amawi, 695 F.3d at 471. They cite to non-national security cases to limit their role in this appeal. \nThe majority fails to recognize that Muhtorov has been unable to fully challenge government assertions that he has \nnever seen. In these circumstances, the burden is on the government to demonstrate the constitutionality of its \nactions, and the burden passes to us to hold the government to account when it fails to do so. \n \n26  The majority chides me for “speculating” that information obtained by the querying mandated by FBI procedures \n  contributed to the decision to seek the traditional FISA application. (Op. at 591 n.12.) Rather than misapprehending \nwhether the traditional FISA evidence was derived from querying (Op. at 591 n.12), my reading of the classified \nrecord underscores that is the exact issue that cannot be resolved. We know that after receiving only a small \nnumber of interceptions that led the FBI to open a new national security investigation, the FBI “would have” queried \n94 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nits databases using identifiers associated with Muhtorov and would have had unfettered access to any responsive \ninformation, including raw § 702 data. More intelligence reports periodically followed. Following these reports, the \nFBI submitted “some” of the universe of intercepted communications to support the traditional FISA application. \n(Op. at 590 (citing Aplee. Br. at 11).) Yet, the FBI officials preparing the traditional FISA application would have been \naware of all, not “some” of the intercepted communications, and the record is silent on whether this universe arose \nfrom the querying mandated by the FBI procedures. \nSimilarly, although the statute did not mandate record-keeping requirements concerning queries of U.S. persons as \na distinct category until 2018, the minimization procedures applicable at the time of the investigation into Muhtorov \nrequired the maintenance of records of all search terms used to query § 702 databases, which would have included \nsearches using identifiers associated with Muhtorov. See PCLOB Report, at 58-59 (“FBI minimization procedures also \npermit the FBI to query unminimized Section 702–acquired data[,] ... [and requires the FBI] to maintain records of all \nterms used to query content.”). The classified record is in accord with the requirements that are described in the \nPCLOB Report. Far from requiring the government to prove a negative (Op. at 591 n.12), given this record-keeping \nrequirement, the government’s failure to provide evidence to disprove that such querying occurred mandates the \nconclusion that we cannot resolve the derivative evidence question on appeal. Although we normally require some \nshowing from the defense to place the origin of the government’s evidence at issue, Muhtorov was deprived of \ninformation necessary to make that showing. Requiring the government to establish in the trial record that its \nevidence did not derive from querying, particularly in light of its own “FISC-approved” minimization procedures \nwhich required record-keeping of any such queries, is far from speculative; instead it is merely “plac[ing] ourselves \nin the shoes of defense counsel, the very ones that cannot see the classified record, and act[ing] with a view to their \ninterests.” Amawi, 695 F.3d at 471. \n \n27  See Gov’t Br. at 11 (“In this case, the government acquired under Section 702 the communications of a non-U.S. \n  person abroad and, in so doing, incidentally collected communications to which Muhtorov was a party. The \ngovernment used some of these incidentally collected communications to support its application for traditional FISA \norders. The fruits of that traditional FISA collection were therefore partially ‘derived from’ information collected \nunder Section 702. Evidence obtained and/or derived from that traditional FISA collection was, in turn, used at \ntrial.”) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). \n \n28  Even on painstaking review of the classified record, the sequence of collection of communications and resulting \n  intelligence reporting is hopelessly muddled. The district court shared this view and ordered the government to \nproduce a classified chronology to resolve these issues. It was filed on November 10, 2015. Unfortunately, this \nchronology fails to provide clarity, and we are left to guess at the answers to critically important questions in the \nderivative evidence inquiry, e.g., which communications the government received at which times, whether and \nwhen querying occurred, and what information motivated the government to seek traditional FISA authorization. \n \n29  FISC, Section 702 2018 Certification, 18 Oct. 2018, at 62, 66 (“In 2017, NCTC, the CIA, and NSA collectively used \n  approximately 7500 terms associated with U.S. persons to query content information acquired under Section 702 ... \nwhile during the same year FBI personnel on a single system ran approximately 3.1 million queries against raw \nFISA-acquired information, including section 702-acquired information.” (citations omitted)). The classified record \ndiscloses the failure of the government to introduce any evidence that it complied with the record-keeping \nresponsibilities imposed by the minimization procedures applicable at the time of the investigation into Muhtorov, \nprocedures upon which the majority premises its Fourth Amendment reasonableness determination. As the \n95 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \ngovernment  acknowledges,  the  classified  record  in  this  case  does  not  specifically  indicate  whether  the  FBI \nconducted querying after it learned from reporting that Muhtorov was helping the IJU. See United States Classified \nBrief at 11. \n \n30  The majority quotes an excerpt of Hasbajrami to support the proposition that subsequent use of § 702-collected \n  information “is not a separate Fourth Amendment event.” (Op. at 605 n.21 (“[B]oth the collection of such \ncommunications and the dissemination of information from such collection about potential criminal actions within \nthe country to domestic law enforcement are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” 945 F.3d at 667-68.”).) \nUtilization of this excerpt is misleading. Despite the majority’s implication that its analysis accords with that of the \nSecond Circuit, the analysis of Hasbajrami stands in stark contrast with that of the majority: “[L]awful collection \nalone is not always enough to justify a future search.” Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 670. Hasbajrami proceeds to explain, \nover several pages, why § 702 data exemplifies “the need for additional probable cause or reasonableness \nassessments to support a search of information or objects that the government has lawfully collected.” Id.; see also \nid. at 670-73. In this analysis, the Second Circuit relied in part on Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 189 \nL.Ed.2d 430 (2014), discussed below. \n \n31  My colleagues attempt to create a distinction between the “querying” of § 702 data and its “use.” (Op. at 605 n.21.) \n  In doing so, the majority asserts that the “mere ‘use’ of already collected Section 702 communications without \nreliance on querying does not trigger the Fourth Amendment.” (Id. at 605.) That may be so, and it is what the \nmajority assumes occurred in this investigation. But the record fails to establish that the § 702 information, which \nwas available a legally significant period of time after the initiation of the investigation to the officials seeking the \ntraditional FISA authorization, did not arise, at a minimum in part, from queries of § 702 information. And as \ndiscussed above, given the applicable minimization procedures, it should. \nCritically, the majority ignores that “use” of a communication first requires law enforcement to know of its \nexistence. For § 702 evidence, this knowledge of existence is obtained either through unmasked intelligence \nreporting or through querying. As explained above, the record in this case does not establish that the information \nleading the FBI to seek a traditional FISA application, the relevant inquiry on appeal, was not obtained through \nquerying. Using the majority’s analogy, law enforcement can only “use” a piece of seized evidence to prepare \naffidavits for warrants to obtain additional evidence for trial, because it has already documented the limited number \nof items of seized evidence to reference in their warrant application. The 250,000,000+ communications that are \ncollected annually under § 702, however, are not documented in real time. Instead, they are stored, often without \nprocessing, in vast lakes of data, and their contents are most often obtained through querying. See PCLOB Report at \n59, 116. In effect, rather than citing a known piece of evidence in a subsequent warrant application, querying is akin \nto fishing in enormous lakes of data to see what information one can catch using various search terms as “bait.” The \nsubsequent  use  of  the  results  of  these  searches  to  seek  traditional  FISA  authorization  “raises  challenging \nconstitutional questions.” Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 670. Under the majority’s approach, law enforcement may \nroutinely fish for Americans’ data without first bothering to obtain a license. Although the majority accepts the \ngovernmental assertion that the § 702 communications were not derived through queries (evidence of which is \nlacking in the record), nothing prevents its use of the plain view and incidental overhear doctrines from being \nextended to cases in which querying did occur. After all, communications obtained through querying have been \n“collected” under § 702, just the same as those at issue in this case. What protects these “lawfully collected \ncommunications,” (Op. at 605), from subsequent querying and use? The majority does not explain. The better \ncourse in this case is to follow the lead of the Second Circuit and to remand for a determination of whether querying \noccurred. That evidence is absent from this record, just as it was in Hasbajrami. See Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 673. \n96 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \n \n32  I am confused by the majority’s assertion that my analysis misapplies Riley. (Op. at 601, n.18, 605 n.21.) Under Riley, \n  a subsequent search of the contents of seized evidence, in that case communications and data contained within a \ncell phone, required a warrant. As the court held in Riley, mere seizure does not authorize search of contents. \nMoreover, to the extent that the majority contends that no search occurred prior to the FISA authorization, their \nargument once again relies on the government’s unsupported assertion that § 702 communications were not \nderived through queries. In my review of the classified and unclassified record, I find no evidence either testimonial \nor otherwise that supports either the government’s assertion in its brief, or the majority’s reliance on the \ngovernmental assertion in its brief, that no querying took place. \n \n33  I am reminded of William Pitt’s speech in the House of Commons decrying the proposed consolidation of powers in \n  the government of India: \nWas it not necessity which had always been the plea of every illegal exertion of power, or exercise of oppression? \nWas not necessity the preten[s]e of every usurpation? Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human \nfreedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves. \nWilliam Pitt, Speech, House of Commons, Nov. 1783. \n \n34  In rejecting the Article III requirement of adverse legal interests, the majority relies upon a 2015 article by Professors \n  James Pfander and Daniel Birk arguing that adverse parties are not required under Article III based on certain \nhistorical instances of what they term the “non-contentious” jurisdiction of federal courts. (Op. at 609 n.29.) I find \nmuch more persuasive Professor Anne Woolhandler’s analysis refuting Pfander and Birk’s examples, and concluding \nthat they instead demonstrate the long-standing requirement of adverse legal interests for Article III jurisdiction. \nSee Anne Woolhandler, Adverse Interests and Article III, 111 Nw. U.L. Rev. 1025 (2017). The majority relies on the \nexistence of ex parte procedures to demonstrate that Article III jurisdiction does not require adverseness. (Op. at \n609 n.29.) In doing so, the majority truncates the requirement of adverse legal interests to instances “when the \ncourt’s decision ‘will have real meaning.’ ” (Op. at 609 n.29 (citing INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 939-40, 103 S.Ct. \n2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983)). Misapprehending my concern, the majority distinguishes Article III’s core requirement \nfrom “the ‘prudential’ preference for the concrete adverseness, ‘which sharpens the presentation of issues.’ ” (Op. \nat 609 n.29 (quoting United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 760, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 186 L.Ed.2d 808 (2013)).) This \nprudential judicial preference, however, presupposes “adequate Art. III adverseness.” Windsor, 570 U.S. at 759, 133 \nS.Ct. 2675 (quoting Chadha, 462 U.S. at 939, 103 S.Ct. 2764 (1983)). It is the lack of the adverseness required under \nArticle III that renders the FISC opinions advisory. The majority’s listing of the government, the ISP companies, and \nthe individuals to be surveilled as parties for which § 702 proceedings will have “real meaning” ignores that at the \ntime of the FISC approvals, no individuals to be surveilled are identified. Their interests are no more different or \nconcrete  than  those  of  every  other  American  whose  communications  might  be  collected.  Thus,  the  §  702 \nproceedings conducted by the FISC are advance advisory approvals of the government’s proposed procedures. The \nconstitutional flaw in the annual FISC § 702 approvals and certifications is that they are issued absent adverse legal \ninterests, and therefore are advisory opinions which are outside the permissible jurisdictional reach of Article III. \nThe majority mischaracterizes Muhtorov’s argument in his reply brief, as “not object[ing] to the non-adversarial \nnature of Section 702 proceedings.” (Op. at 609 n.29 (citing Aplt. Reply Br. at 24).) Its chosen sentence fragment, \nhowever, is taken out of context. In opposing the government’s attempt to analogize § 702 proceedings to \n“individualized review of warrant and wiretap applications,” Muhtorov states: “The problem is not that the FISC’s \n97 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (2021)   \n \n \nreview is one-sided, but that it is a free-floating review of general procedures, divorced from any actual case.” \nExactly. Far from a concession that adverse legal interests are not required by Article III, Muhtorov was rebutting the \ngovernment’s analogy of § 702 surveillance approvals by the FISC to the far different ex parte procedures involved in \nwarrant applications, applications which Muhtorov acknowledged did constitute a case or controversy. Muhtorov \nwas making the argument in this section of his reply brief that adverse legal interests are required for an Article III \ncase or controversy, and that absent those adverse legal interests, FISC opinions are impermissible advisory \nopinions. \n \n35  My colleagues’ proposed distinction, that “President Washington would have been free to ignore the Supreme \n  Court’s advice without immediate legal consequence,” (Op. at 611 n.31), rings hollow. So too the Executive here. \nThere is ample evidence that the Executive routinely fails to comply with the FISC-approved procedures without \nfacing any sanction. See, e.g., 2020 FISC Certification Opinion, 39-60 (Nov. 18, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.intelligence.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/20/2020_FISC%20Cert%20Opinio\nn_10.19.2020.pdf; Redacted [Oct. 2018 FISC Opinion], 402 F. Supp. 3d 45, 76-82 (FISC 2018), aff’d in part sub nom. \nIn re DNI/AG 702(h) Certifications 2018, 941 F.3d 547 (FISCR 2019). \nMore concerning under Article III, if President Washington did not ignore the Supreme Court, he could have \nproduced its “advice” as a definitive pronouncement on the legality of his actions in any subsequent legal challenge, \njust as the government does here. The government briefs are replete with assertions that the FISC approvals are a \nlegal determination that § 702 surveillance is consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Just as Washington may have \nargued when challenged in a subsequent actual case or controversy, the Executive argues in this appeal that the \nFISC decisions establish the constitutional reasonableness of its § 702 activities. Just as with Jefferson’s letter, the \nExecutive’s request for advance judicial blessing of its procedures under § 702 seeks an impermissible advisory \nopinion. \n \n36  The majority’s assertion that this proposed remedy “is precisely what courts—including the district court and this \n  court in the present case—already do when a criminal defendant seeks suppression of Section 702-derived \nevidence,” (Op. at 618–19 n.37), is disingenuous. The majority concludes it was reasonable to collect Muhtorov’s \ncommunications “during the course of otherwise lawful Section 702 surveillance.” (Op. at 598.) It later explains that \nthis surveillance was lawful only if it was conducted under “pre-authorization or a relevant exception.” (Op. at 610.) \nGiven  this,  any  claim  that  the  majority  does  not,  like  other  courts,  rely  on  and  grant  deference  to  FISC \ndeterminations is specious. The continued constitutional viability of the § 702 surveillance program absent the \nFISC’s advisory opinions, upon which much of the government’s assertions of Fourth Amendment reasonableness \nrest, is a significant constitutional question. However, faced as we are with a criminal prosecution resting upon § \n702 evidence, we must evaluate the reasonableness of any searches de novo. Unfortunately, as I explain above, the \nrecord is inadequate to allow us to conduct this analysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n98 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \nA.  OVERVIEW \n1The government is filing this unclassified memorandum in opposition to: \n(1) Defendant Jamshid Muhtorov's (\"Muhtorov\") \"Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained or \nDerived from Surveillance Under the FISA Amendments Act and Motion for Discovery,\" which was \njoined by Defendant Bakhtiyor Jumaev (\"Jumaev\") (\"defendants' motion\") (CR 520; CR 521).  In \nessence, the defendants' motion seeks: (1) disclosure ofrecords and documents relating to,.among \nother things, the government's acquisition, use, and dissemination of either defendants' \ncommunications acquired pursuant to Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (\"FAA\") \n(collectively, \"the Section 702 materials\"); and (2) suppression of all evidence obtained or derived \nfrom surveillance conducted pursuant to the FAA.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court should \ndeny the defendants' motion in its entirety. \nThe defendants' motion for discovery and suppression was filed in response to the \ngovernment's Second FISA Notice as to Muhtorov, filed on October 25, 2013, which provided \n\"notice to defendant and the Court, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c) and 1881e(a), that the \ngovernment has offered into evidence or otherwise used or disclosed in proceedings, including at \ntrial,\" in this case \"information derived from the acquisition of foreign intelligence information \nconducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 [FISA], as amended, 50 \nU.S.C. § 1881a.\"  (\"Government's Second Notice,\" CR 457).  The Government's Second Notice was \nfiled based on a recent determination by the government that certain evidence referenced in the \noriginal FISA notification, filed on February 7, 2012 (CR 12), obtained or derived from collection \nconducted pursuant to Title I and Title III of FISA, was itself also derived from Title VII collection \n1 CLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 97\nas to which defendant Muhtorov was aggrieved.  Section 702 of the PAA (part of Title VII of PISA \nand codified at Section 1881a of PISA) permits the targeting ofnon-U.S. persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States, in order to acquire foreign intelligence information, \nsubject to certain statutory requirements.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  Defendants seek suppression of \nthe Section 702-derived evidence used in this case, as well as discovery of the PISA materials.2 \nThe defendants' motion has triggered this Court's review of the relevant Section 702 \nmaterials pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881e(a) and 1806(f) to determine whether the Section 702 \nintelligence collection at issue herein was lawfully authorized and conducted in accordance with the \nrequirements of the PAA.  In particular, Section 1806( f) provides that, where the Attorney General \ncertifies that \"disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United \nStates, a district court \"shall, notwithstanding any other law ... review in camera and ex parte the \napplication, order, and such other materials relating to the surveillance as may be necessary to \ndetermine whether the surveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted.\" \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(f); see also 50 U.S.C. § 1825(g).  This same procedure applies to motions to \ndisclose Section 702-related materials or to suppress information obtained or derived from Section \n2  The defendants' suggestion that some bad faith or bad purpose underlies this determination is \nunfounded. Defs. Mot. 5-7.  The Department has always understood that it is required to notify any \n\"aggrieved person\" of its intent to use or disclose, in a proceeding against such person, any \ninformation obtained or derived from Title VII collection as to which that person is an aggrieved \nperson, in accordance with 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e), and 1881e(a).  Prior to recent months, however, \nthe Department had not considered the particular question of whether and under what circumstances \ninformation obtained through electronic surveillance under Title I or physical search under Title III \ncould also be considered to be derived from prior collection under Title VIL  After conducting a \nreview of the issue, the Department determined that information obtained or derived from Title I or \nTitle III PISA collection may, in particular cases, also be derived from prior Title VII collection, \nsuch that notice concerning both Title I/III and Title VII collections should be given in appropriate \ncases with respect to the same information.  The Second Notice filed in this case, which the \ngovernment filed based on its own review, resulted from that determination and demonstrates good \nfaith, not misconduct. \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 97\n702 acquisitions, which is deemed to be electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to Title I of \nFISA for purposes of such motions.  50 U.S.C. § 1881e(a).  The Attorney General has filed such a \ndeclaration in this case. 3 \nOnce the Attorney General files a declaration, the court \"may disclose to the aggrieved \nperson, under appropriate security procedures and protective orders, portions of the application, \norder or other materials relating to the surveillance only where such disclosure is necessary to make \nan accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1806(£).  As explained \nbelow, this Court should conduct an in camera, ex parte review of the documents relevant to \ndefendants' motion, in accordance with the provisions of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881e(a) and 1806(£).  See \nalso 50 U.S.C. § 1825(g). \nThe government expects that the Court will conclude from its in camera, ex parte review \nthat: ( 1) defendant Jumaev lacks standing to challenge the FAA in this case; (2) the acquisition, \nretention, and dissemination of foreign intelligence information pursuant to the FAA at issue herein \nwas lawfully authorized and conducted in accordance with the Act; (3)  the FAA complies with the \nFourth Amendment and Article III of the U.S. Constitution; (4) evidence obtained or derived from \nthe FAA collection at issue herein should not be suppressed; and (5) the defendants' discovery \nrequests should be denied to the extent that they seek disclosure of materials related to the FAA. \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nIn opposition to the defendants' motion, the government submits this unclassified \nmemorandum of law.  In this unclassified version of the classified memorandum, all classified \ninformation, and all header, footer, and paragraph classification markings have been redacted.4 \n3 \nThe Declaration and Claim of Privilege of the Attorney General of the United States is being filed \nboth publicly and as part of this classified filing.  See Sealed Exhibit 1. \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 97\nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nB.  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nIn subsequent sections of this Memorandum, the government will: (1) present an overview of \nthe case facts, background, procedural history, and summary of the collection at issue; (2) give an \noverview of Section 702 of the FAA; (3) describe the Section 702 certification(s) and summarize the \ncollection at issue in this case; ( 4) establish defendant J umaev' s lack of standing to challenge the \nconstitutionality of Section 702 or the Section 702 collection at issue in this case; (5) establish the \nconstitutionality of Section 702 as applied in this case; (6) establish that the specific Section 702 \ncollection at issue in this case was legally authorized and conducted pursuant to the applicable \ntargeting and minimization procedures; (7) explain why defendants' motion for discovery of the \nSection 702 materials should be denied; and (8) explain why defendants are not entitled to a hearing \nunder Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). \nAll of the government's pleadings and supporting materials are being submitted not only to \noppose the defendants' motion but also to support the United States' request, pursuant to FISA, that \nthis Court (1) conduct an in camera, ex parte review of the Section 702 materials; (2) find that the \nSection 702 acquisition was lawfully authorized and conducted in conformity with the Constitution, \nthe statute, and the approved targeting and minimization procedures; (3) hold that disclosure to the \ndefense of the Section 702 materials and the government's classified submissions is not required \nbecause the Court is able to make an accurate determination of the legality of the collections at issue \nwithout disclosing any portion thereof; and (4) order that none of the Section 702 materials be \ndisclosed to the defense, and instead that they be maintained by the United States under seal. \n4 As a· result of the redactions, the pagination and footnote numbering of the classified memorandum \nand the unclassified memorandum are different. \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 97\n1.  Defendant Jumaev's Motion Should be Summarily Denied \nBecause the government is not entering into evidence or otherwise using or disclosing \ninformation obtained or derived from Section 702 collection to which Jumaev is aggrieved in this \nprosecution, he has no standing to challenge the constitutionality of Section 702 or the Section 702 \ncollection at issue in this case. 50 U.S.C. § 1806(d); see 50 U.S.C. § 1825(d); see also 50 U.S.C. § \n1881e(a). See infra Part II. \n2.  Section 702 Is Constitutional \nIn their motion to suppress evidence derived from Section 702 foreign intelligence \nacquisition, defendants argue that Section 702 of the FAA violates the Fourth Amendment and \nArticle III of the United States Constitution.  As an initial matter, this Court's review should be \nlimited to the constitutionality of the statute as applied to the acquisition of the information \nchallenged in this case.  See In re Directives Pursuant to Section 105B oft he Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, 551 F.3d 1004, 1010 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2008) (\"Where, as here, a statute has been \nimplemented in a defined context, an inquiring court may only consider the statute's constitutionality \nin that context; the court may not speculate about the validity of the law as it might be applied in \ndifferent ways or on different facts\").  As applied to the acquisition at issue here, Section 702 is \nconstitutional.  See infra at Part III. \nFirst, the Section 702 collection at issue was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  The \ncollection lawfully targeted non-U.S. person(s) located outside the United States, who generally are \nnot protected by the Fourth Amendment, for foreign intelligence purposes.  That U.S. persons' \ncommunications might be incidentally acquired during such collection does not trigger a warrant \nrequirement.  Nor does that fact render the collection unreasonable, in light of the compelling \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 97\nnational security interests at stake and the extensive procedural safeguards that protect the privacy \ninterests of U.S. persons.  See infra at Part III.A. \nSecond, Section 702, in requiring the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to \nreview the government's proposed certification(s) and implementing procedures for acquisitions, \ndoes not place the FISC in a role inconsistent with that accorded to Article III courts under the \nConstitution.  The FISC's role under Section 702 is similar to the ability of federal courts to review \nex parte applications for warrants, wiretap orders, and subpoenas.  Like those provisions, Section \n702 is entirely consistent with governing Article III principles.  See infra at Part III.B. \n3.  The Collection In this Case Was Lawfully Authorized and Conducted \nIn addition to challenging the general constitutionality of Section 702, the defendants also \nquestion the government's compliance with the applicable procedures with respect to the specific \ninformation that has been used in his case.  The government submits that this Court's in camera, ex \nparte review of the relevant classified materials will establish that the Section 702 acquisition at \nissue was lawfully authorized and conducted.  First, the applicable certification(s) and procedures, \nall of which were reviewed and approved by the FISC, complied with all of Section 702's \nrequirements.  Second, the Section 702 collection at issue was conducted in accordance with the \nstatute and those approved certification(s) and procedures.  See infra at Part IV.A-C. \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n4.  Defendants' Motion for Discovery of the Section 702 Materials Should Be \nDenied \nBecause the Attorney General has certified that disclosure of the classified FISA materials \nwould harm the national security of the United States, the Court may disclose these materials (or \nportions thereof) \"only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 97\nlegality of the surveillance [or search].\" 50 U.S.C. § 1806(t) (emphasis added).  Here, the \ngovernment submits that the Court will be able to determine the legality of the Section 702 \ncollection at issue without the need to disclose classified materials to the defense.  As the \ngovernment's submissions make clear, the Section 702 collection was lawful and the defendants' \nallegations to the contrary may be considered, and rejected, based on an examination of the \nclassified record.  Contrary to the defendants' contention, and as this Court's review of the classified \nrecord will show, there is no basis for a finding of material misrepresentations or other factors that \nwould indicate a need for disclosure in this case. Nor are the Section 702 materials exculpatory or \notherwise subject to disclosure under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). See infra at Part V. \n5.  No Franks Hearing Should Be Held \nFinally, defendants are not entitled to a hearing under Franks, 438 U.S. at 154, because there \nwere no material omissions or misrepresentations of fact.  Moreover, defendants' reliance on alleged \ngovernmental misconduct and misrepresentations in other, unrelated matters cannot establish a \nFranks violation in this case.  There is no basis on which to hold a Franks hearing.  See infra Part \nVI. \nC.  BACKGROUND \n1.  The FBl's Investigation of the Defendants \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n2.  Procedural History \nOn January 19, 2012, the government charged Muhtorov by criminal complaint in the \nDistrict of Colorado with providing material support or resources to a designated FTO, namely, the \nIJU, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 23398.  (CR 1).  On January 23, 2012, a federal grand jury sitting in \nthe District of Colorado returned a one-count indictment charging Muhtorov with the same offense. \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 97\nl \n1 \n(CR 5).  On March 20, 2012, the grandjury returned a superseding indictment charging Muhtorov \nwith two counts of providing and attempting to provide material support and resources to the IJU, \nand charging Muhtorov and Jumaev with one count of providing and attempting to provide material \nsupport and resources to the IJU, and one count of conspiring to commit that offense, all in violation \nof 18 U.S.C. § 2339B.  (CR 50).  The grandjury returned a second superseding indictment on March \n22, 2012, containing the same charges as those set forth in the first superseding indictment.  (CR 59). \nOn February 7 and April 4, 2012, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c) and 1825(d), the United \nStates provided notice to Muhtorov and Jumaev respectively that it intended \"to offer into evidence \nor otherwise use or disclose in any proceedings in the above-captioned matter, information obtained \nand derived from electronic surveillance or physical search conducted pursuant to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), as amended, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811, 1821-1829.\" \n(CR 12, 68).  The statutes cited in those notices permit electronic surveillance and physical search \nwhen a significant purpose is to obtain foreign intelligence information, provided that the \ngovernment establishes to the satisfaction of the FISC that, among other things, there is probable \ncause to believe that the target is an agent of a foreign power.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801, 1804-1805, \n1821, 1823-24.  Electronic surveillance under these provisions is commonly referred to as Title I \ncollection, while physical search is commonly referred to as Title III collection. \nOn February 8, 2012, Muhtorov filed a motion to suppress PISA-acquired evidence for \npurposes of detention (CR 14), and on May 25, 2012, Muhtorov filed a supplemental motion to \nsuppress PISA-acquired evidence.  (CR 125).  On July 30, 2012, Jumaev filed his combined FISA-\nrelated motions.  (CR 157).  After conducting an ex parte, in camera review of the relevant material, \nthe Court denied both defendants' PISA-related motions on September 24, 2012.  (CR 196). \n15 \nI \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 97\nOn October 25, 2013, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c) and 1881e(a), the United States \nprovided the Second FISA Notice to Muhtorov, stating that it intended \"to offer into evidence or \notherwise use or disclose in any proceedings in the above-captioned matter information obtained or \nderived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), as amended, 50 U.S.C. §1881a.\"  (CR 457).  On \nJanuary 29, 2014, Muhtorov filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained or derived from collection \nunder Section 702, together with a motion for discovery of materials related to the Section 702 \ncollection.  (CR 520). \nThe government has not provided similar notice to Jumaev under 50 U.S.C. § 1881a. \nJumaev filed a motion requesting that the court order the government to provide him notice as to its \nintent to use evidence obtained or derived from surveillance authorized by the FAA.  (CR 458).  In \nits response and surreply to Jumaev's motion, the government stated that it does not intend to \nintroduce or C>therwise use or disclose against Jumaev in any trial, hearing or other proceeding in this \ncase evidence obtained or derived from Section 702 acquisition to which Jumaev is an aggrieved \nperson.  Thus, Jumaev is not entitled to any additional notice under FISA.  (CR 470, 525). \nNotwithstanding the fact that he lacks statutory standing to seek suppression of any Section 702-\nobtained or derived evidence, on January 30, 2014, Jumaev filed a motion to adopt Muhtorov's · \nSection 702-related suppression motion and motion for discovery.  (CR 521). \n3.  Overview of the FAA Collection at Issue \nAs set forth in the government's submissions in the previous FISA litigation, the government \nintends to introduce evidence obtained and derived from electronic surveillance and searches that \nwere conducted pursuant to Titles I and III of FISA.  This Court has already upheld the legality of \nthat Title I and III collection.  (CR 196.)  Thus, at issue in defendants' instant motion is the use of \n16 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 97\nevidence obtained or derived from collection pursuant to Section 702 to which defendant Muhtorov \nis an aggrieved person. \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \na.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nSince the founding of this country, the government has relied on foreign intelligence \ncollection to protect the nation.  For the majority of that time and through the present day, much of \nthis intelligence gathering has been conducted under the President's constitutional authority over  t \nJ \nnational security and foreign affairs, with methods of surveillance evolving over time in light of \nr \nt \n17 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 97\ndeveloping technologies.  Presidents have authorized warrantless wiretaps for foreign intelligence \npurposes since at least 1940.  See, e.g., United States v.  United States Dist. Ct, 444 F.2d 651, 669-71 \n(6th Cir. 1971) (reproducing as an appendix memoranda from Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and \nJohnson). \nIn 1978, Congress enacted FISA \"to regulate the use of electronic surveillance within the \nUnited States for foreign intelligence purposes.\" See S. Rep. No. 604, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 \n(1977).  The statute was a response to congressional investigations into abuses of surveillance \ndirected at specific American citizens and political organizations.  Id at 7-8.  FISA was designed to \nprovide a check against such abuses by placing certain types of foreign intelligence surveillance \nunder the oversight of the FISC. 5 \nBefore the United States may conduct \"electronic surveillance,\" as defined in FISA, to obtain \nforeign intelligence information, the statute generally requires the government to obtain an order \nfrom a judge on the FISC.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1805; see 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(a), 1804(a).  To obtain such \nan order, the government must establish, inter alia, probable cause to believe that the \"target of the \nelectronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power\" and that \"each of the \nI  facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed\" (inside or outside the United States) \"is \nbeing used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.\"  50 U.S.C. § \n1805(a)(2).  The government must also establish that the \"minimization procedures\" that it will \nemploy are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance \nto minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublic information \nconcerning unconsenting \"United States persons,\" consistent with the government's need to obtain, \n5 The judges which sit on the FISC are Article III judges with life tenure that serve by designation of \nthe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  50 U.S.C. § 1803(a). \n18 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 97\nproduce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 180l(h), 1805(a)(3) \nand (c)(2)(A). \nIn FISA, Congress limited the definition of the \"electronic surveillance\" governed by the \nstatute to four discrete types of domestically-focused foreign intelligence collection activities.  See \n50 U.S.C. § 1801(f).  Specifically, Congress defined \"electronic surveillance\" to mean (1) the \nacquisition of the contents of a wire or radio communication obtained by \"intentionally targeting\" a \n\"particular, known United States person who is in the United States\" in certain circumstances; (2) \nthe acquisition of the contents of a wire communication to or from a \"person in the United States\" \nwhen the \"acquisition occurs in the United States\"; (3) the intentional acquisition of the contents of \ncertain radio communications when the \"sender and all intended recipients are located within the \nI \n1  United States\"; and ( 4) the installation or use of a surveillance device \"in the United States\" for \nmonitoring or to acquire information other than from a wire or radio communication in certain \ncircumstances.  Id.  (emphasis added); cf 50 U.S.C. § 1801(i) (defining \"United States person\" to \nmean, as to natural persons, a citizen or permanent resident of the United States). \nBecause ofFISA's definition of \"electronic surveillance,\" FISA as originally enacted did not \napply to the vast majority of surveillance the government conducted outside the United States.  This \nwas true even if that surveillance might specifically target U.S. persons abroad or incidentally \nacquire, while targeting third parties abroad, communications to or from U.S. persons or persons \nlocated in the United States.  See S. Rep. No. 701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 & n.2, 34-35 & n.16 \n(1978).6  Congress was told in the hearing leading to FISA's enactment that the acquisition of \n6 Executive Order No. 12333, as amended, addresses, inter alia, the government's \"human and \ntechnical collection techniques ... undertaken abroad.\"  Exec. Order No. 12333, § 2.2, 3 C.F.R. 210 \n(1981 Comp.), reprinted as amended in 50 U.S.C. § 401 note (Supp. II 2008).  That Executive Order \ngoverns the intelligence community, inter alia, in collecting \"foreign intelligence and counter-\n19 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 97\ninternational communications at the time did not rely on the four types of \"electronic surveillance\" \ncovered by the definitions in the proposed legislation - including wire interceptions executed in the \nUnited States - and thus those operations would not be affected by FISA.  See Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act:  Hearing before the Subcomm. On Crim. Laws and Procedures oft he S. Judiciary \nComm., 94th Cong., 2d Sess., at 11 (\"Mar. 29, 1976 FISA Hrg.\"). 7  Congress heard similar testimony \nfrom other witnesses.8  Accordingly, at the time FISA was enacted, Congress understood that most \nforeign-to-foreign and international communications fell outside the definition of \"electronic \nsurveillance.\" See S. Rep. No. 701, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 71 (\"[T]he legislation does not deal with \ninternational signals intelligence activities as currently engaged in by the National Security \nAgency.\").  Where the government did not intentionally target a particular, known U.S. person in the \nUnited States, FISA allowed the government to monitor international communications through radio \nintelligence\" abroad, collecting \"signals intelligence information and data\" abroad, and utilizing \nintelligence relationships with \"intelligence or security services of foreign governments\" that \nindependently collect intelligence information.  Id.  §§ l.3(b)(4), l.7(a)(l), (5) and (c)(l). \n7 Attorney General Levi subsequently elaborated:  \"The bill does not purport to cover interceptions \nof all international communications where, for example, the interception would be accomplished \noutside of the United States, or, to take another example, a radio transmission that does not have \nboth the sender and all intended recipients within the United States.\"  Electronic Surveillance within \nthe United States for Foreign Intelligence Purposes:  Hearings before the Subcomm.

The Protect America Act and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \nIn 2006, Congress began considering proposed amendments to FISA aimed at modernizing \nthe statute in response to changes in communications technology since its original enactment.  See \nModernization oft he Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act:  Hearing before the H  Permanent \nSelect Comm. On Intel.,  109th Cong., 2d Sess. (2006).  Congress took up the issue concurrently with \nan inquiry into the Terrorist Surveillance Program (\"TSP\") - a program authorized by the President \nafter the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which allowed the NSA to intercept \ncommunications into, and out of, the United States where the government reasonably believed that a \ncommunicant included a member or agent of al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist organization.  S. Rep. \nNo. 209, 110th Cong., 1st Sess. 2-5 (2007).  The TSP was not carried out under FISA or with the \nauthorization of the FISC.  The President's confirmation of the program in 2005 led Congress to \n\"inquire vigorously\" into the TSP and to \"carefully review[] the impact of technological change on \nFISA collection to assess whether amendments to FISA should be enacted.\"  Id. at 2. \nThe Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\") and other government officials explained the \nneed for this legislation in various appearances before Congress from 2006 to 2008.  As the DNI \nexplained, it was necessary to amend FISA because its definition of \"electronic surveillance\" was \n\"tie[d] to a snapshot of outdated technology.\"  Modernization oft he Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act:  Hearing before the S. Select Comm. on Intel., 110th Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (2007) \n(\"May 1, 2007 FISA Modernization Hrg.\"), at 19.  The DNI explained further that, since the creation \nof the definition three decades previously, \"[c]ommunications technology ha[d] evolved in ways that \nhave had unforeseen consequences under [the statute].\"  Id. \n21 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 97\nMore specifically, the DNI explained that, whereas international communications were \npredominantly carried by radio when FISA was enacted, that was no longer true:  \"Communications \nthat, in 1978, would have been transmitted via radio or satellite, are now transmitted principally by \nfiber optic cables\" - and therefore qualify as wire communications under FISA.  Id  Thus, many \ninternational communications that would have been generally excluded from FISA regulation in \n1978, when they were carried by radio, were now potentially included, due merely to a change in \ntechnology rather than any intentional decision by Congress.  Id 9 \nFurther, the DNI stated, with respect to the collection of wire communications, FISA's \n\"electronic surveillance\" definition \"places a premium on the location of the collection.\"  May 1, \n2007 FISA Modernization Hrg. 19; see 50 U.S.C. § 1801(±)(2).  The DNI explained that \ntechnological advances had rendered this distinction outmoded as well:  \"Legislators in 1978 could \nnot have been expected to predict an integrated global communications grid that makes geography \nan increasingly irrelevant factor.  Today, a single communication can transit the world even if the \ntwo people communicating are only located a few miles apart.\"  May 1, 2007 FISA Modernization \nHrg. 19.  In this environment, regulating communications differently based on the location of \ncollection arbitrarily limits the government's intelligence-gathering capabilities.  As the Director of \nthe NSA elaborated in an earlier hearing: \n[As a communication travels the global communications network,] NSA may have \nmultiple opportunities to intercept it as it moves and changes medium.  As long as a \nco~unication is otherwise lawfully targeted, we should be indifferent to where the \nintercept is achieved.  Signals intelligence is a difficult art and science, especially in \ntoday's telecommunication universe.  Intercept of a particular communication ... is \n9 Compare 50 U.S.C. § 1801(±)(2) (defining wire communication as \"electronic surveillance\" if, \ninter a/ia, one party is in the United States) with 50 U.S.C. § 1801(±)(3) (defining radio \ncommunication as \"electronic surveillance\" only if the sender and all intended recipients are in the \nUnited States). \n22 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 97\nalways probabilistic, not deterministic.  No coverage is guaranteed.  We need to be \nable to use all the technological tools we have. \nFISAfor the 21st Century:  Hearing before the S. Comm. On the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(2006) (statement ofthen-NSA Director General Michael V. Hayden). \nAlthough FISA was originally crafted to accommodate the government's collection of \nforeign and international communications as those operations were commonly conducted in 1978, \nthe government in 2008 faced a different communications technology environment and a different \nterrorist threat and needed greater flexibility than the statute's terms allowed.10  The fix needed for \nthis problem, as a Department of Justice official put it, was a \"technology-neutral\" framework for \nsurveillance of foreign targets - focused not on \"how a communication travels or where it is \nintercepted,\" but instead on \"who is the subject of the surveillance, which really is the critical issue \nfor civil liberties purposes.\"  May 1, 2007 FISA Modernization Hrg. 46 (statement of Asst. Att'y \nGen. Kenneth L. Wainstein). \nThat review initially led to the enactment in August 2007 of the Protect America Act \n(\"PAA\"), Pub. L. No. 110-55 (2007).  Congress enacted the PAA in order to bring FISA \"up to date \nwith the changes in communications technology,\" while at the same time preserving \"the privacy \ninterests of persons in the United States\" and addressing the \"degraded capabilities in the face of a \n10 As the DNI testified: \nIn  today's  threat  environment,  . . .  FISA  . ..  is  not  agile  enough  to  handle  the \ncommunity's and the country's intelligence needs.  Enacted nearly 30 years ago, it \nhas not kept pace with 21st century developments in communications technology.  As \na result, FISA frequently requires judicial authorization to collect the communications \nof non-U.S. - that is foreign - p[ersons] located outside the United States ... This \nclogs FISA process with matters that have little to do with protecting civil liberties or \nprivacy of persons in the United States.  Modernizing FISA would greatly improve \nthat process and relieve the massive amounts of analytic resources currently being \nused to craft FISA applications. \nMay 1, 2007 FISA Modernization Hrg. 18. \n23 \n\n_,---\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 97\nheightened terrorist threat environment\" that resulted from FISA' s \"requirement of a court order to \ncollect foreign intelligence about foreign targets located overseas.\"  S. Rep. No. 209, l lOth Cong., \n1st Sess. 5-6.  The PAA fulfilled these purposes by empowering the DNI and the Attorney General \nto jointly authorize \"the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons \nreasonably believed to be located outside the United States.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1805b(a).  To authorize \nsuch collection, the PAA required the DNI and the Attorney General to certify, inter alia, that there \nwere reasonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition concerned persons (whether \nU.S. persons or non-U.S. persons) reasonably believed to be located outside the United States \n(\"targeting procedures\"), there were minimization procedures in place that satisfied FISA's \nrequirements for such procedures, and a significant purpose of the acquisition was to acquire foreign \nintelligence information.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1805b(a)(l)-(5).  The PAA also authorized the FISC to \nreview the DNI and Attorney General's determination regarding the reasonableness of the targeting \nprocedures.  Finally, the PAA authorized private parties who had been directed by the government to \nassist in effectuating surveillance under the statute to challenge the legality of such a directive in the \nFISC, 50 U.S.C. § 1805b(h)(l)(A), and to appeal an adverse decision to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court of Review (\"FISA Court of Review\"), id. § 1805b(i). 11  One private party \nbrought such a challenge, and both the FISC and the FISA Court of Review upheld the PAA.  See In \nre Directives, 551 F.3d 1004 (holding that surveillance authorized under the PAA fell within the \nforeign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement and was otherwise reasonable under the \nFourth Amendment). \n11 \nThe FISA Court of Review is composed of three United States District or Circuit Judges who are \ndesignated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

Amnesty Int'! USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1144 (2013).13  Section \n702 provides that, \"upon the issuance\" of an order from the FISC, the Attorney General and DNI \nmay jointly authorize the \"targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United \nI \nStates\" for a period of up to one year to acquire \"foreign intelligence information.\"  50 U.S.C. § \ni \n188 la(a).14 \nUnder Section 1881a(b), the authorized acquisition must comply with each of the following \nrequirements, which are directed at preventing the intentional targeting of U.S. persons or persons \nlocated within the United States, or collection of communications known at the time of acquisition to \nbe purely domestic: \n(1)  The authorized acquisition \"may not intentionally target any person known at the \ntime of acquisition to be located in the United States.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(b)(l). \n12 In 2012, Congress reauthorized the FAA for an additional five years.  See FISA Amendments Act \nReauthorization Act of2012, Pub. L. No. 112-238, 126 Stat. 1631. \n13 The FAA enacted other amendments to FISA, including provisions not at issue in this case that \ngovern the targeting of United States persons outside the United States.

DEFENDANTS' CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS LACK MERIT \nDefendants move for suppression of evidence derived from the acquisition of foreign \nintelligence information under Section 702 on the ground that Section 702 is unconstitutional. (Defs. \nMot. 21-47).  For the reasons set forth below, defendants' motion should be denied. \n33 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 97\nA.  THE ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION \nUNDER SECTION 702 IS LAWFUL UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT \nFor the reasons set forth below, the collection at issue in this case, pursuant to Section 702 \nand the applicable certification(s) and targeting and minimization procedures, was consistent with \nthe Fourth Amendment. \nThe Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, \nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\" and \nthat \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\"  \"[A]lthough 'both the concept of probable \ncause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search,\"' New Jersey v. \nTL.O., 469 U.S. 325, 340 (1985) (citation omitted), \"neither a warrant nor probable cause, nor, \nindeed, any measure of individualized suspicion, is an indispensable component of reasonableness in \nevery circumstance.\" Nat'/ Treas. Employees Union v.  Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989).  The \n\"touchstone\" of a Fourth Amendment analysis \"is always 'the reasonableness in all the \ncircumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen's personal security.\"' \nPennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 108-09 (1977) (per curiam) (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. \n1, 19 (1968)). \nAs explained below, the Section 702-authorized collection at issue in this case, which was \nconducted pursuant to court-approved procedures reasonably designed to target non-U.S. persons \nlocated outside the United States, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  First, the Fourth \nAmendment generally does not apply to non-U.S. persons abroad, and the fact that collection \ntargeting such persons also incidentally collects communications of U.S. persons does not trigger a \nwarrant requirement or render the collection constitutionally unreasonable.  Second, surveillance \nauthorized under Section 702 falls within the well-recognized \"foreign intelligence exception\" to the \n34 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 97\nwarrant requirement because ( 1) the government's purpose - protecting against terrorist attacks and \nother external threats - extends \"beyond routine law enforcement,\" and (2) \"insisting upon a warrant \nwould materially interfere with the accomplishment of that purpose.\" In re Directives, 551 F.3d at \n1010-11. \nGiven the inapplicability of the warrant requirement, the challenged collection need only \nmeet the Fourth Amendment's general reasonableness standard.  That standard is satisfied here.  The \ngovernment has interests of the utmost importance in obtaining foreign intelligence information \nunder Section 702 to protect national security.  In contrast, the privacy interests of U.S. persons in \ninternational communications are significantly diminished, if not completely eliminated, when those \ncommunications have been transmitted to or obtained from non-U.S. persons located outside the \nUnited States.  Finally, the privacy interests of U.S. persons whose communications are incidentally \ncollected are amply protected by stringent safeguards the government employs in implementing the \ncollection.  Those safeguards include (1) certifications by Executive Branch officials concerning the \npermissible foreign intelligence purposes of the collection; (2) targeting procedures designed to \nensure that only non-U.S. persons abroad are targeted; (3) minimization procedures to protect the \nprivacy of U.S. persons whose communications are incidentally acquired; (4) the requirement of a \nsignificant purpose to obtain foreign intelligence information; (5) extensive oversight within the \nExecutive Branch, as well as by Congress and the FISC; and (6 ) a prior judicial finding that the \ntargeting and minimization procedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment. In light of these \nand other safeguards employed by the government, the FISC has repeatedly concluded that \nacquisition of foreign intelligence information under Section 702 and the applicable targeting and \nminimization. procedures is constitutionally reasonable.  This Court should reach the same \nconclusion. \n35 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 97\n1.  There is No Judicial Warrant Requirement Applicable to Foreign \nIntelligence Collection Targeted at Foreign Persons Abroad \na.  The Fourth Amendment Generally Does Not Apply to Non-U.S. \nPersons Abroad \nThe Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not \"apply to activities of the \nUnited States directed against aliens in foreign territory.\"  United States v.  Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 \nU.S. 259, 267 (1990); see also id. at 271 (noting that only persons who \"have come within the \nterritory of the United States and developed substantial connections\" to the country have Fourth \nAmendment rights).  Based on the Fourth Amendment's text, drafting history, and post-ratification \nhistory, id. at 265-67, as well as its own precedents, id. at 268-71, the Supreme Court concluded that \nthe Fourth Amendment was not intended ''to restrain the actions of the Federal Government against \naliens outside of the United States territory,\" id. at 266.  \"If there are to be restrictions on searches \nand seizures ~hi ch occur incident to such American action,\" the Court explained, \"they must be \nimposed by the political branches through diplomatic understanding, treaty, or legislation.\"  Id. at \n275.  Because the Fourth Amendment generally does not protect non-U.S. persons outside the \nUnited States, at least where such persons lack \"substantial connections\" to this country, the Fourth \nAmendment a fortiori does not prevent the government from subjecting them to surveillance without \na warrant. \nIntelligence collection under Section 702 targets non-U.S. persons located outside the United \nI  States.  Accordingly, under Verdugo-Urquidez, the Fourth Amendment generally is inapplicable to \npersons who are targeted for collection in accordance with the requirements of the statute.22  For that \nI \nl \nI \n22 \nThe head of each element of the intelligence community must report annually to the FISC \n~ \nconcerning, inter alia, how many persons the element targeted under Section 702 (based on the \nI \nI \n36 \nl \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 37 of 97\nreason, to the extent defendants attempt a facial challenge to Section 702 (see Defs. Mot. 49 n.15), \nthe challenge fails, because the statute is constitutional in its application to persons unprotected by \nthe Fourth Amendment.  See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (noting that, outside \nof the First Amendment context, a statute is facially invalid only ifit is unconstitutional in all of its \npossible applications ).23 \nb.  Incidental Collection of U.S. Person Communications Pursuant to \nIntelligence Collection Lawfully Targeting Non-U.S. Persons \nLocated Outside the United States Does Not Trigger A Warrant \nRequirement \nThe statute does not permit United States persons to be intentionally targeted under Section \n702.  To the extent that U.S. person communications  are collected incidentally under Section 702 in \nthe course of-intelligence collection targeted at one or more non-U.S. persons outside the United \nStates: \"incidental collections occurring as a result of constitutionally permissible acquisitions do not \nrender those acquisitions unlawful.\"  In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015; United States v. Kahn, 415 \nU.S. 143, 156-57 (1974) (upholding interception of communications of a woman that were \nincidentally collected pursuant to a criminal wiretap order targeting her husband); see also United \nStates v.  White, 401 U.S. 745, 751-53 (1971) (holding that a conversation recorded with the consent \nof one participant did not violate another participant's Fourth Amendment rights); United States v. \nMartin, 599 F .2d 880, 884-85 (9th Cir. 1979), overruled in part on other grounds by United States v. \nDe Bright, 730 F.2d 1255 (9th Cir. 1984) (en bane); United States v. Figueroa, 757 F.2d 466, 472-73 \n(2d Cir. 1985) (rejecting challenge to Title Ill on the ground that it allows interception of \nbelief that the persons were located outside the United States) who were later determined to be \nlocated inside the United States.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(1)(3)(A)(iii). \n23 In any event, this Court's review should be limited to the constitutionality of the statute as applied \nto the acquisition of the information challenged in this case. \n37 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 38 of 97\nconversation~ of unknown third parties); United States v. Butenko, 494 F.2d 593, 608 (3d Cir. 1974) \n(upholding the constitutionality of warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes even \nthough \"conversations ... of American citizens[] will be overheard\"); United States v. Bin Laden, \n126 F. Supp. 2d 264, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (\"[I]ncidental interception of a person's conversations \nduring an otherwise lawful surveillance is not violative of the Fourth Amendment.\").  Therefore the \nincidental collection of U.S. person communications was lawful.24 \nUnder these principles, incidental capture of a U.S. person's communications during \nsurveillance that lawfully targets non-U.S. persons abroad does not imply that a judicial warrant or \nother individualized court order is required for such surveillance to be reasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment.  See Bin Laden, 126 F. Supp. 2d at 281 (noting that \"the combination of Verdugo-\nUrquidez and the incidental interception cases\" would permit surveillance that collects a U.S. \nperson's communications as an incident to warrantless surveillance targeting a non-U.S. person \nabroad, so long as the United States person is not a \"known and contemplated\" surveillance target). \nThus, surveillance of non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Section 702, even \nwithout a warrant or probable cause, is not rendered unlawful if the surveillance incidentally \ncaptures the communications of non-targeted persons in the United States.  This conclusion is \nparticularly appropriate here because the privacy interests of U.S. persons whose communications \nare incidentally collected are specifically protected by minimization procedures, as described supra \nat Part I.D.3.d.2.  See In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1016 (noting that'the minimization procedures \nunder the PAA \"serve ... as a means of reducing the impact of incidental intrusions into the privacy \nof non-targeted United States persons\"). \n24 \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n38 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 39 of 97\nApplication of a warrant requirement to incidental interception of U.S. person \ncommunications during surveillance targeting non-U.S. persons abroad for foreign intelligence \npurposes not only would be contrary to case law but also would be impracticable and inconsistent \nwith decades of foreign-intelligence collection practice.  See In re Terrorist Bombings of US. \nEmbassies, 552 F.3d 157, 169 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that the warrant requirement does not apply to \nsearches or surveillance of U.S. citizens that occur outside the United States because the original \npurpose of the Fourth Amendment \"was to restrict searches and seizures which might be conducted \nby the United States in domestic matters\"); United States v. Barona, 56 F.3d 1087, 1092 n.1 (9th Cir. \n1995) (foreign searches have \"neither been historically subject to the warrant procedure, nor could \nthey be as a practical matter\"); United States v. Stokes, 726 F.3d 880, 893 (7th Cir. 2013) (rejecting \nwarrant requirement for extraterritorial searches targeting United States persons and holding such \nsearches \"are subject only to the Fourth Amendment's requirement ofreasonableness\").25  Before \ninitiating surveillance of a foreign target, the government cannot know the identities of all those with \nwhom the target will communicate in the future, and there will generally be at least some possibility \nI \nthat the target will communicate with a U.S. person.  See Bin Laden, 126 F. Supp. 2d at 280 (\"[T]he \nf \n• \ngovernment is often not in a position of omniscience regarding who or what a particular surveillance  r \nI \nwill record.\").  Thus, imposition of a warrant requirement for any incidental interception of U.S. \nI \nperson communications would effectively require a warrant for all foreign intelligence collection, \neven though the foreign targets lack Fourth Amendment rights and their communications often \ninvolve only other foreigners.  Such a rule would unduly restrict the government's intelligence \n25 While defendants cite cases recognizing a warrant requirement for electronic surveillance in the \ndomestic context (Defs. Mot. 27, 32), they do not point to any authorities indicating that foreign \nintelligence surveillance targeting non-United States persons outside the United States must be  I \nsubject to the warrant procedure. \nf \n'  f \n39  I \nl \nl \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 40 of 97\ncollection against foreign targets and degrade its ability to protect against foreign threats.  See \nWarrantless Surveillance and The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: The Role ofC  hecks and \nBalances in Protecting Americans' Privacy Rights (Part II) Hearing Before the H Judiciary Comm., \nI 10th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (2007) (statement of Rep. Forbes) (\"To require a court order for every \ninstance in which a foreign target communicates with someone inside the United States is to require \na court order for every foreign target, and requiring this would reverse 30 years of established \nintelligence gathering ... The intelligence community cannot possibly know ahead of time who \nthese terrorists will talk to.  It needs to have the flexibility to monitor calls that may occur between a \nforeign terrorist and a person inside the United States.\"). \nc.  The Location of the Search Does Not Trigger a Warrant \nRequirement \nVerdugo-Urquidez involved a physical search that was conducted overseas, while collection \nunder Section 702 takes place within the United States.  In the context of electronic communications, \nhowever, the fact that the communications of a non-U.S. person outside the United States may be \ncollected from within the United States is not the kind of \"significant voluntary connection with the \nUnited States\" that brings that person within the protection of the Fourth Amendment under \nVerdugo-Urquidez.  494 U.S. at 271-72.  Otherwise, any foreign person abroad seeking to evade \nUnited States surveillance, including al Qaeda terrorists, could claim the protections of the Fourth \nAmendment merely due to this type of insignificant connection to the United States.  That result \nwould be plainly contrary to the Supreme Court's statements in Verdugo-Urquidez that the Fourth \nAmendment was not originally intended to protect \"aliens outside of the United States territory.\"  Id. \nat 266-67.  Moreover, when the government collects the communications of a non-U .S. person \nlocated abroad, whether the collection takes place in the United States or abroad makes no difference \n40 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 41 of 97\nto the person's privacy interests and should not affect the constitutional analysis.  When it comes to \nthe content of communications, \"the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\"  United States \nv.  Yonn, 702 F.2d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir. 1983)(quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 \n(1967)).  Accordingly, there is no \"constitutional distinction which depends upon the location of the \nrecording apparatus.\" Id. \n2.  The Foreign Intelligence Exception Applies \nEven assuming, arguendo, that incidental collection ofU.S.-person communications under \nSection 702 is subject to the same constitutional scrutiny as foreign intelligence collection targeting \nU.S. persons, cf [Caption Redacted], 2011WL10945618, at *26 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011) (noting that \n\"[t]here surely are circumstances in which incidental intrusions can be so substantial as to render a \nsearch or seizure unreasonable\"), the Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant here because \nsuch surveillance falls within the well-recognized foreign intelligence exception. \na.  The \"Special Needs\" Doctrine \nThe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, which is assessed by balancing \nthe degree to which a search is needed to promote legitimate governmental interests against the \nsearch's intrusion on a person's privacy interests.  See United States v. Knights, 534 U.S. 112, 118-\n19 (2001 ).  In certain contexts, a search or surveillance is impermissible without a warrant or other \nindividualized court order.  See Vernonia Sch.Dist. 47Jv. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652-53 (1995) \n(\"Where a search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal \nwrongdoing, this Court has said that reasonableness generally requires the obtaining of a judicial \nwarrant.\").  But that procedure is by no means inflexibly required.  Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct. \n1958, 1969 (2013) (The Fourth Amendment \"imposes no irreducible requirement\" of individualized \nsuspicion.); see, e.g., United States v. Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. 149, 153 (2004) (The government \n41 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 42 of 97\nI \nI \nhas \"plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border, without probable cause \nj \nor a warrant.\"). \nThe Supreme Court has recognized exceptions to the Fourth Amendment's warrant \nrequirement \"when special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant \nand probable-cause requirement impracticable,\" Griffin v.  Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 873 (1987), \nsuch as where the governmental need is especially compelling or especially likely to be frustrated by \na warrant requirement, where expectations of privacy are diminished, and where alternative \nsafeguards restrain the government within reasonable limits.  See King, 133 S. Ct. at 1969; see also, \ne.g. Griffin, 483 U.S. at 873-74, (upholding warrantless search of probationer's home); Vernonia \nSch. Dist., 515 U.S. at 653 (upholding warrantless drug testing of student-athletes by public school \ndistrict); Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 847 (2006) (upholding suspicionless searches of \nparolees).  In evaluating whether the \"special needs\" doctrine applies, the Supreme Court has \ndistinguished between searches designed to uncover evidence \"of ordinary criminal wrongdoing\" \nand those motivated \"at [a] programmatic level\" by other governmental objectives.  City of \nIndianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37-40, 48 (2000) (reviewing cases). \nThe \"special needs\" doctrine applies where special government interests beyond the normal \nneed for law enforcement make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable, and in \nsuch cases the court \"employ[s] a balancing test that weigh[s] the intrusion on the individual's \ninterest in privacy against the 'special needs' that supported the program.\"  Ferguson v. City of  I \nCharleston, 532 U.S. 67, 78 (2001).  Accordingly, the Supreme Court has permitted, inter alia, \nI \nwarrantless stops of motorists at roadblocks for the purpose of securing borders, see United States v. \nI \nMartinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543 (1976), warrantless searches of the homes of probationers to ensure \nl \n! \nI \n42 \nI \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 43 of 97\ncompliance with probation conditions, see Griffin, 483 U.S. at 872, and warrantless searches of \npublic school students to enforce school rules, see TL. 0., 469 U.S. at 340. \nb.  The Foreign Intelligence Exception \nSeveral courts of appeals - including the FISA Court of Review - have held, by analogy to \nthe \"special needs\" doctrine, that the government's \"special need\" for foreign intelligence \ninformation justifies an exception to the warrant requirement.  See, e.g., United States v. Duka, 671 \nF.3d 329, 341 (3d Cir. 2011) (\"[C]ourts [that have considered the question] almost uniformly have \nconcluded that the important national interest in foreign intelligence gathering justifies electronic \nsurveillance without prior judicial review, creating a sort of 'foreign intelligence exception' to the \nFourth Amendment's warrant requirement.\"); In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1010-11 (recognizing \"a \nforeign intelligence exception\" to the warrant requirement); In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 742 \n(FISA Ct. Rev. 2002) (\"[A]ll the ... courts to have decided the issue [have] held that the President \ndid have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation.\"); United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 912-13 (4th Cir. 1980) (upholding \nwarrantless foreign intelligence surveillance authorized by the Attorney General); United States v. \nBuck, 548 F.2d 871, 875 (9th Cir. 1977) (\"Foreign security wiretaps are a recognized exception to \nthe general warrant requirement.\"); Butenko, 494 F.2d at 605 (upholding warrantless foreign \nintelligence surveillance); United States v. Brown, 484 F.2d 418, 426 (5th Cir. 1973) (holding that \n\"the President may constitutionally authorize warrantless wiretaps for the purpose of gathering \nI \nforeign intelligence\");26 but see Zweibon v. Mitchell, 516 F.2d 594, 618-20 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (en \n26 Except for Jn re Directives, these cases involved collection of foreign intelligence information \nfrom persons inside the United States.  Their reasoning applies a fortiori to the Section 702 \nacquisition in this case, which targeted non-United States person(s) reasonably believed to be outside \nthe United States. \n43 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 44 of 97\nbane) (plurality opinion suggesting in dicta that a warrant may be required even in a foreign \nintelligence investigation).27  These decisions have found that foreign intelligence collection justifies \nan exception because the \"programmatic purpose\" of obtaining foreign intelligence information goes \n\"beyond any garden-variety law enforcement objective,\" and \"requiring a warrant would hinder the \ngovernment's ability to collect time-sensitive information and, thus, would impede the vital national \nsecurity interests that are at stake.\" In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011. \nContrary to these cases, defendants contend (Defs. Mot. 32) that the foreign intelligence \nexception is \"narrow[]\" and applies only when the search is minimally intrusive and executive \ndiscretion is strictly confined. There is no such limitation on the doctrine.  Cf MacWade v. Kelly, \n460 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting, in upholding under special needs doctrine warrantless \nsubway searches to prevent terrorist attacks, that \"[t]he Supreme Court never has implied-much \nless actually held - that a reduced privacy expectation is a sine qua non of special needs analysis\"). \nWhile considerations of intrusiveness and executive discretion may be relevant to the reasonableness \nof a government program designed to serve a special need, neither factor is decisive regarding \nwhether the doctrine applies at the threshold as an exception to the warrant clause.  See id. at 268-69 \n(addressing such factors under the general reasonableness test, separately from the threshold \nquestion whether the searches served a governmental purpose distinct from ordinary law \nenforcement). \nDefendants rely (Defs. Mot. 27-29) on the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. \nUnited States District Court (Keith), 407 U.S. 297 (1972).  This reliance is misplaced, as the Court \nin Keith expressly reserved the issue of a warrant requirement for foreign intelligence collection.  As \n27 The plurality in Zweibon specifically noted that the surveillance at issue targeted a domestic \norganization and suggested that its conclusion might be different if a foreign power were targeted. \nSee 516 F.2d at 651. \n44 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 45 of 97\nthe FISA Cotµt of Review recognized in In re Sealed Case, the Supreme Court explained in Keith \nthat \"the focus of security surveillance 'may be less precise than that directed against more \nconventional types of crime' even in the area of domestic threats to national security.\"  310 F.3d at \n738 (emphasis in original); see also Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1143 (noting that Keith \"implicitly \nsuggested that a special framework for foreign intelligence surveillance might be constitutionally \npermissible\").  The same rationale \"applies a fortiori to foreign threats,\" a fact that Congress \nnecessarily recognized in enacting FISA.  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 738; see also Truong, 629 \nF.2d at 913 (\"For several reasons, the needs of the executive are so compelling in the area of foreign \nintelligence, unlike the area of domestic security, that a uniform warrant requirement would, \nfollowing Keith, 'unduly frustrate' the President in carrying out his foreign affairs responsibilities.\"). \nIn addition, unlike the intelligence collection at issue here, the surveillance in Keith was conducted \nnot only without a warrant but without any judicial or congressional oversight of any kind.  See \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-37 (1952) (Jackson, J. concurring) \n(\"When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority \nis at its maximum.\").  Courts that have addressed the issue of whether foreign intelligence collection \nis subject to a warrant requirement have expressly distinguished Keith in holding that it is not.  Jn re \nDirectives, 551 F.3d at 1010; In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 744; Truong, 629 F.2d at 913; Butenko, \n494 F.2d at 602 n.32; Brown, 484 F.2d at 425. \nIn sum, courts have generally recognized, by analogy to the \"special needs\" doctrine, that a \nforeign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement exists.  As the FISC has held, and for the \nreasons set forth below, that exception applies to acquisitions under Section 702.  [Caption \nRedacted], 2011WL10945618, at *24 (\"The Court has previously concluded that the acquisition of \n45 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 46 of 97\nforeign intelligence information pursuant to Section 702 falls within the 'foreign intelligence \nexception' to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\"). \nc.  The Government's Purpose in Section 702 Collection Goes \nBeyond Ordinary Crime Control \nFirst, it is clear that the government's programmatic purpose in obtaining the information \npursuant to Section 702 goes beyond routine law enforcement.  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at \n717 (holding that the government's \"programmatic purpose\" in obtaining foreign intelligence \ninformation is \"to protect the nation against terrorist and espionage threats directed by foreign \npowers\" - \"a special need\" that fundamentally differs from \"ordinary crime control.\"); see also \nI  Cassidy v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 67, 82 (2d Cir. 2006) (upholding warrantless searches of ferry \npassengers because \"[p] reventing or deterring large-scale terrorist attacks present problems that are \ndistinct from standard law enforcement needs and indeed go well beyond them\").  Acquisitions \nunder Section 702 must be conducted with a \"significant purpose\" to \"obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation.\"  As the FISA Court of Review found in the context of the PAA, the \"stated purpose\" \nof the collect~on \"centers on garnering foreign intelligence,\" and \"[t]here is no indication that the \ncollections of information are primarily related to ordinary criminal-law enforcement purposes.\" \nThe same is true of the collection authorized under Section 702 in this case.28 \nd.  A Warrant or Probable Cause Requirement Would Be \nImpracticable \nSecond, as the FISA Court of Review found with respect to the FAA' s predecessor statute, \n\"there is a high degree of probability that requiring a warrant would hinder the government's ability \nto collect time-sensitive information and, thus, would impede the vital national security interests that \n28 CLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n46 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 47 of 97\nare at stake.\" In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011; see also Truong, 629 F.2d at 913 (noting that \n\"attempts to counter foreign threats to the national security require the utmost stealth, speed, and \nsecrecy\" and, therefore, \"[a] warrant requirement would add a procedural hurdle that would reduce \nthe flexibility of executive foreign intelligence initiatives, in some cases delay executive response to \nforeign intell~gence threats, and increase the chance of leaks regarding sensitive executive \noperations\").29  Changes in technology and the manner of collecting foreign intelligence information, \nas well as the shifting threat and communications methods employed by transnational terrorist \ngroups, make it impracticable for the government to obtain traditional warrants or FISC orders for \nthe acquisitions currently authorized under Section 702.  Indeed, Congress enacted the FAA in part \nbecause the burden of preparing individualized FISA applications for intelligence collection \ntargeting non-U.S. persons outside the United States was harming the government's ability to collect \nforeign intelligence information from targets overseas.  See 154 Cong. Rec. S6097, S6122 (June 25, \n2008) (statement of Senator Chambliss) (\"[T]he [FAA] will fill the gaps identified by our \nintelligence officials and provide them with the tools and flexibility they need to collect intelligence \nfrom targets overseas.\"). \nWhen the government has reason to believe that a non-U.S. person overseas is connected to \ninternational terrorist activities but the government lacks sufficient evidence to establish probable \ncause that the target is an agent of a foreign power, a warrant requirement could prevent the \ngovernment from obtaining significant information.  Even in circumstances where the government \nsucceeded in eventually gathering enough information to establish probable cause under FISA, the \nneed to devefop such information and obtain approval of the FISC could result in delays that would \nhinder the government's ability to monitor fast-moving threats.  See In re Directives, 551 F.3d at \nl \n29 CLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n47 \nl··j·:·i  \n' \n~ \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 48 of 97\n1011-12 (Because of the government's \"need for speed, stealth, and secrecy\" in this context, \n\"[c  ]ompulsory compliance with the warrant requirement would introduce an element of delay, thus \nfrustrating the government's ability to collect information in a timely manner\"); cf Verdugo-\nUrquidez, 494 U.S. at 273-74 (\"Application of the Fourth Amendment\" to aliens abroad could \n\"significantly disrupt the ability of the political branches to respond to foreign situations involving \nour national interest.\"); Skinner v: Ry. Labor Execs. 'Ass 'n, 489 U.S. 602, 623 (1989) (upholding \nwarrantless search in part because \"the delay necessary to procure a warrant ... may result in the \ndestruction of valuable evidence\"). Finally, a warrant requirement in this context would impose \nsignificant burdens on the government, because substantial resources and time of national security \npersonnel would be diverted to preparing individualized warrant applications targeting persons who \nlack Fourth J\\rnendment rights.  Cf Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 666-67 (the mission of the Customs \nService \"would be compromised if it were required to seek search warrants in connection with \nroutine, yet sensitive, employment decisions\"); O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 722 (1987) \n(plurality opinion) (\"requiring an employer to obtain a warrant\" to access employee's office or files \n\"would seriously disrupt the routine conduct of business and would be unduly burdensome\"). \nIn short, a warrant requirement would significantly undermine the government's ability to \nobtain foreign intelligence information vital to the Nation's security.  See Bin Laden, 126 F. Supp. \n2d at 273 (\"[T]he imposition of a warrant requirement [would] be a disproportionate and perhaps \neven disabling burden\" on the government's ability to obtain foreign intelligence information).  That \nwould be a particularly unnecessary result because Section 702 collection may not intentionally \ntarget persons protected by the Fourth Amendment, see 50 U.S.C. § 188la(b), and the law contains \nrobust safeguards that protect the interests of U.S. persons whose communications might be \nincidentally collected.  See United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 121-22 (2d Cir. 2010) \n48 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 49 of 97\n(\"[T]he Constitution's warrant requirement is flexible, so that different standards may be compatible \nwith the Fourth Amendment in light of the different purposes and practical considerations at issue.\") \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).30 \ne.  A Warrant Requirement Would Inappropriately Interfere \nwith Executive Branch Discretion in the Collection of Foreign \nIntelligence \nThe Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement is based in part on the interest in \n\"interpos[ing] a judicial officer between the zealous police officer ferreting out crime and the subject \nof the search.\" In re Terrorist Bombings, 552 F.3d at 170 n.7.  But that concern is considerably \ndiminished in this context because of \"the acknowledged wide discretion afforded the executive \nbranch in foreign affairs.\"  Id.; see Truong, 629 F.2d at  914 (\"[T]he executive branch not only has \nsuperior expertise in the area of foreign intelligence, it is also constitutionally designated as the pre-\neminent authority in foreign affairs.\").  For that reason, the Fourth Amendment does not require that \ncourts interpose themselves in the Executive Branch's collection of foreign intelligence beyond the \nprocedures provided for by Congress. \nf.  Truong Does Not Preclude Application of the Foreign \nIntelligence Exception to Section 702 Collection \nDefe~dants contend (Defs. Mot. 32-33), relying on Truong, that the foreign intelligence \nexception is limited to circumstances where: (1) the surveillance was directed at a specific foreign \nagent or foreign power; (2) the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence information; and \n3°F or these reasons, defendants' claim (Defs. Mot. 31-32) that the availability of.Title I FISA \nwarrants undermines the rationale for the foreign intelligence exception is incorrect.  Moreover, \n1 \ncourts have recognized the continuing validity of the rationale for the foreign intelligence exception \neven after the enactment ofFISA created a regime in which the government could obtain a court \norder to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance in certain circumstances.  See, e.g., In re \nDirectives, 551 F.3d at 1010-11; In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 742; Duka, 671 F.3d at 341; \n[Caption Redacted], 2011WL10945618, at *24 (Oct. 3, 2011). \n49 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 50 of 97\n(3) the surveillance was personally approved by the President or Attorney General.  This argument \nmisreads Truong and should be rejected. \nThe specific foreign-agent-or-power limitation was recognized in Truong, which involved \nunilateral Executive Branch surveillance directed at a person within the United States.  However, \nnothing in Truong suggests that foreign intelligence surveillance directed at non-U.S. persons \noutside the United States, as authorized by Congress and conducted pursuant to targeting and \nminimization procedures approved by the FISC, must be directed only at a specific foreign agent or \nforeign power.  And, for the reasons explained in Part III.A.2.d above, such a requirement would \nseriously undermine the government's ability to obtain foreign intelligence information in this \ncontext and, in any event, would be unnecessary since the targets of the surveillance are persons \nunprotected by the Fourth Amendment. 31 \nI \nDefendants' second limitation invokes the purported \"primary purpose\" requirement that has \nbeen repeatedly rejected by Congress and the courts.  See In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011; In re \nSealed Case, 310 F.3d at 742-45; Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 121; Duka, 671 F.3d at 343-45.  As the \nFISA Court of Review has explained, the \"primary purpose\" language adopted in Truong \"drew an \nunstable, unrealistic, and confusing line between foreign intelligence purposes and criminal \ninvestigation purposes.\"  In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011.  Because \"[a] surveillance with a \nforeign intelligence purpose often will have some ancillary criminal-law purpose,\" such as \n\"apprehension of terrorism suspects,\" id., attempting to discern whether criminal-law purposes are \nprimary or secondary to intelligence purposes can be an artificial exercise.  See In re Sealed Case, \n310 F.3d at 743.  Accordingly, \"the more appropriate consideration is the programmatic purpose of \nthe surveillances and whether - as in the special needs cases - that programmatic purpose involves \n31 \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n50 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 51 of 97\nsome legitimate objective beyond ordinary crime control.\"  In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011; see \nalso In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 745-46.  In In re Sealed Case, the FISA Court of Review \nconstrued the \"significant purpose\" requirement to preclude the government from using FISA as a \n\"device to investigate wholly unrelated ordinary crimes.\"  Id.  at 735-36.  Congress used the same \nterm in the PAA, and Section 702 should be presumed to have incorporated this construction. See \nCannon v.  Univ. ofC  hic., 441 U.S. 677, 696-99 ( 1979).  So construed, the \"significant purpose\" \nstandard is sufficient for purposes of the \"special needs\" doctrine and \"foreign intelligence\" \nexception.  See Edmond, 531 U.S. at 40-42 (noting that the doctrine turns on whether the \nprogrammatic purpose of a search goes beyond the investigation of \"ordinary criminal \nwrongdoing\"); In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011 (upholding directives under the PAA because \n\"[t]heir stated purpose centers on garnering foreign intelligence\" and \"[t]here is no indication that \nthe collections of information are primarily related to ordinary criminal-law enforcement purposes\"). \nAs for the third purported limitation defendants invoke, it is true that the Attorney General \ndoes not personally approve each individual acquisition under Section 702.  However, the Attorney \nGeneral and Director of National Intelligence play a significant role in establishing and authorizing \nthe certification and procedures that govern the acquisition.  See 50 U.S.C. 188la(a) (collection \nunder Section 702 must be jointly authorized by the Attorney General and Director of National \nIntelligence).  In addition, unlike the unilateral executive branch surveillance in Truong, Section 702 \ncollection is governed by stringent, court-approved procedural safeguards and extensive oversight by \nCongress and by the FISC.  Those requirements provide sufficient authorization and oversight, by \nall three branches of government, for purposes of the foreign intelligence exception. \n51 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 52 of 97\n3.  The Government's Collection of Foreign Intelligence Information \nPursuant to Section 702 Is Constitutional Under The Fourth \nAmendment's General Reasonableness Test \nAs explained above, incidental collection of communications of U.S. persons during an \notherwise lawful collection does not render the collection constitutionally unreasonable.  See Part \nIIl.A.1.b.  That principle applies here because the collection lawfully targeted non-U.S. persons \noutside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes.  Moreover, as set forth below, even \nassuming that such incidental collection must satisfy the Fourth Amendment's \"general \nreasonableness\" test, the acquisitions at issue here were lawful under that test. \nIn circumstances where a warrant and probable cause are not required, searches and seizures \nare generally subject to the Fourth Amendment's \"traditional standards of reasonableness.\"  King, \n133 S. Ct. at 1970; see id. (\"To say that no warrant is required is merely to acknowledge that rather \nthan employing aper se rule of unreasonableness, we balance the privacy-related and law \nenforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was reasonable.\") (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  In assessing the constitutional reasonableness of a government search, \nthe court must weigh \"the promotion of legitimate governmental interests against the degree to \nwhich [the search] intrudes upon an individual's privacy.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted); Knights, 534 U.S. at 117-19 (describing balancing as \"general Fourth Amendment \napproach\"); T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 337 (stating that \"[t]he determination of the standard of \nreasonableness\" requires balancing).  The court determines what is reasonable, and what safeguards \nmay be necessary in a particular context, by balancing the interests at stake in light of ''the totality of \nthe circumstances.\" Samson, 547 U.S. at 848; see also Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 665, 668 (recognizing \nthat \"neither a warrant nor probable cause, nor, indeed, any measure of individualized suspicion, is \nan indispensable component of reasonableness in every circumstance\" and that \"the traditional \n52 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 53 of 97\nprobable-cause standard may be unhelpful\" when the government \"seeks to prevent\" dangers to \npublic safety); In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1012 (reviewing collection under the PAA under the \ngeneral reasonableness test). \nUnder the general reasonableness balancing test, searches without a warrant or individualized \nfinding of probable cause are particularly likely to be found reasonable when the governmental need \nis especially great or especially likely to be frustrated by a warrant requirement, when the search \ninvolves modest intrusions on the individual's privacy, and when alternative safeguards restrain the \ngovernment within reasonable limits.  See, e.g., Ill. v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 330-31 (2001) \n(\"When faced with special law enforcement needs, diminished expectations of privacy, minimal \nintrusions, or the like, the Court has found that certain general, or individual, circumstances may \nrender a warrantless search or seizure reasonable.\"); King, 133 S. Ct. at 1969 (warrantless search \nmay be reasonable where \"the public interest is such that neither a warrant nor probable cause is \nrequired\" or where \"an individual is already on notice ... that some reasonable [government] \nintrusion on his privacy is to be expected\") (citation omitted). \nThe Supreme Court recently engaged in this kind of balancing in King, which involved \nI \nwarrantless searches of arrestees to obtain DNA samples.  133 S. Ct. at 1968-69.  The Court \nI \nexamined the totality of the circumstances, weighed the various interests at stake, and concluded, in \nI  light of the government's \"substantial interest\" in the \"identification of arrestees,\" the diminished \nI \nexpectations of privacy of an individual taken into police custody, and statutory protections that \nl \nlimited the purposes for which the DNA evidence could be collected and stored, that the balance \nI \nfavored the government.  Id. at 1977-80; see also Samson, 547 U.S. at 848-57 (applying \nreasonableness balance in upholding warrantless, suspicionless search of the person of a parolee). \n1 \nj \nI \n53 \nI \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 54 of 97\nIn In re Directives, the FISA Court of Review applied the general reasonableness test in \nconsidering the constitutional reasonableness of the PAA, the FAA' s predecessor statute, in the \ncontext of an as-applied challenge brought by a private party that had been directed by the \ngovernment to assist in effectuating surveillance under the statute.  551 F.3d at 1012-15.32  In \nbalancing the respective interests, the FISA Court of Review recognized that the government's \ninterest in national security was of such a \"high[] order of magnitude\" that it would justify \nsignificant intrusions on individual privacy.  Id. at 1012.  The FISA Court of Review noted further \nthat the PAA, the certifications, and the directives contained a \"matrix of safeguards,\" id. at 1013, \nincluding \"effective minimization procedures\" that were \"almost identical to those used under FISA \nto ensure the curtailment of both mistaken and incidental acquisitions,\" id. at 1015, as well as \n\"targeting procedures\" that included \"provisions designed to prevent errors\" and provided for \nExecutive Branch and congressional oversight of \"compliance with the targeting procedures,\" id. \nThe FISA Co.urt of Review concluded, based on the panoply of safeguards in the statutory provisions \nand implementing procedures, that \"the surveillances at issue satisfy the Fourth Amendment's \nreasonableness requirement.\" Id. at 1016.33 \n.I  \nf \n32 The PAA was not identical to, and in certain respects was broader than, Section 702.  Notably, the \nPAA authorized surveillance concerning \"persons reasonably believed to be outside the United \nStates\" without distinguishing between U.S.- and non-U.S. persons, In re Directives, 551 F.3d at \n1007, while Section 702 authorizes only surveillance targeting non-U.S. persons outside the United \nStates.  In addition, the petitioner in In re Directives limited its claims to alleged injuries to U.S. \npersons.  Accordingly, the analysis in In re Directives addresses certain issues specific to foreign \nintelligence surveillance targeted at U.S. persons abroad, including a requirement that surveillance \ntargeting U.S. persons be based on a finding by the Attorney General of probable cause to believe \nthat the U.S. person was a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, that are not applicable here. \n33 In re Directives was not litigated ex parte.  The FISA Court of Review considered briefing and \noral argument from both the government and the communications provider that challenged the \ndirectives.  551 F.3d at 1008. \n54 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 55 of 97\nThe FAA provisions, certification( s) , and procedures at issue in this case, with respect to \ncollection targeting non-U.S. persons overseas, are as protective as, and in some respects \nsignificantly more robust than, the comparable PAA procedures that the PISA Court of Review \nconsidered in holding that the directives issued under the PAA were constitutional.34  In addition, the \nFAA goes beyond the PAA by requiring a prior finding by the FISC that the targeting and \nminimization procedures are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i).  The \nFAA, unlike the PAA, also expressly prohibits \"reverse targeting\" of U.S. persons.  50 U.S.C. § \n188la(b)(2).  The FAA thus stands on an even firmer constitutional foundation than the PAA, and \nthe PISA Court of Review's analysis upholding the latter applies also to the former.  Defendants' \nmotion does not distinguish, or even cite, the PISA Court of Review's opinion in In re Directives. \nIn addition, the FISC has repeatedly reviewed the targeting and minimization procedures \ngoverning the government's acquisition of foreign intelligence information under Section 702 and \nheld that acquisitions pursuant to those procedures satisfy the Fourth Amendment reasonableness \nstandard.  See [Caption Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *6 (\"The Court found in those prior \ndockets that the targeting and minimization procedures were consistent with the requirements of \n[Section 702] and with the Fourth Amendment.\").  There is no reason for a different outcome here. \na.

Courts \nhave recognized that the government's compelling interest in collecting foreign intelligence \ninformation to protect the Nation against terrorist groups and other foreign threats may outweigh \nindividual privacy interests.  See, e.g., In re Terrorist Bombings, 552 F.3d at 172-76 (upholding \nsearch and surveillance targeting U.S. person abroad because the intrusion on the individual's \nprivacy was outweighed by the government's need to monitor the activities of al Qaeda); Cassidy, \n471 F.3d at 82 (upholding warrantless searches of ferry passengers in light of government interest in \n\"[p ]reventing or deterring large-scale terrorist attacks\"). \nThe collection authorized by Section 702 is crucial to the government's efforts against \nterrorism and other threats both to the United States and its interests abroad.  See National Security \nAgency, The National Security Agency:  Missions, Authorities, Oversight and Partnerships 4 \n(August 9, 2013) (\"[C]ollection under FAA Section 702 is the most significant tool in the NSA \ncollection arsenal for the detection, identification, and disruption of terrorist threats to the U.S. and \naround the world.\").  As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found in recommending re \nauthorization of the FAA in 2012, \"the authorities provided under the FISA Amendments Act have \ngreatly increased the government's ability to collect information and act quickly against important \nforeign intelligence targets.\"  S. Rep. No. 174, 112th Cong., 2nd Sess. 2 (2012); see also id. at 17 \n(noting that Section 702, in addition to \"provid[ing] information about the plans and identities of \n56 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 57 of 97\nterrorists\" also enables the government to collect \"information about the intentions and capabilities \nof weapons proliferators and other foreign adversaries who threaten the United States\").  The \nCommittee noted further that \"failure to reauthorize Section 702\" would \"result in a loss of \nsignificant intelligence and impede the ability of the Intelligence Community to respond quickly to \nnew threats and intelligence opportunities.\"  Id.; see also H.R. Rep. 645 (II) 112th Cong., 2nd Sess. \n3 (Aug. 2, 2012) (\"The importance of the collection of foreign intelligence under the FISA \nAmendments Act ... cannot be underscored enough. ... The information collected under this \nauthority is often unique, unavailable from any other source, and regularly provides critically \nimportant insights and operationally actionable intelligence on terrorists and foreign intelligence \ntargets around the world.\"). \nA panel of experts appointed by the President to review the government's intelligence \ncollection activities examined \"the details of 54 counterterrorism investigations since 2007 that \nresulted in the prevention of terrorist attacks\" and found that \"[i]n all but one of these cases, \ninformation obtained under section 702 contributed in some degree to the success of the \ninvestigation.\"  The President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, \nLiberty and Security in a Changing World 144-45 (Dec. 12, 2013).  The panel concluded that \n.  l \n\"[S]ection 702 has clearly served an important function in helping the United States to uncover and \nprevent terrorist attacks both in the United States and around the world.\"  Id. at 145.  Thus, as the \nExecutive Branch, Congress, the FISC, and the President's Review Group have all recognized, the \ngovernment has an extraordinarily compelling interest in conducting the collection authorized by \nSection 702. \n57 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 58 of 97\nb.  Defendants Have, At Most, Limited Expectations of Privacy in \nCommunications Obtained Through Targeting Non-U.S. \nPersons Outside the United States \nThe other side of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness balance is the degree to which the \nsearch \"intrudes upon an individual's privacy.\"  Knights, 534 U.S. at 118-19 (citation omitted).  Of \ncourse, where an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy at all, his Fourth Amendment \nclaim fails at the threshold.  And where the search takes place in circumstances where the \nindividual's expectations of privacy are limited, the diminished character of the privacy interest must \nbe taken into account in the court's assessment ofreasonableness. \nAn individual's ability to \"claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment depends ... upon \nwhether\" he \"has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place.\"  Rakas v. Illinois, 439 \nU.S. 128, 143 (1978).35  A court may not exclude evidence under the Fourth Amendment unless it \nfinds that an unlawful search or seizure \"invaded [the defendant's] legitimate expectation of privacy \nrather than that ofa third party.\"  United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 731 (1980).  To claim the \nprotection of the Fourth Amendment, a defendant \"must demonstrate that he personally has an \nexpectation of privacy in the place searched, and that his expectation is reasonable; i.e., one that has \n'a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts ofreal or personal \nproperty law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.'\" Minnesota v. \nCarter, 525 U.S. 83, 88 (1998) (quoting Rakas, 439 U.S. at 144 n.12); see also, e.g., United States v. \n35  Although the Supreme Court has formerly analyzed questions concerning an individual's ability \nto claim Fourth Amendment protections under the rubric of\"standing,\" the Court made clear in \nRakas that \"definition of those rights is more properly placed within the purview of substantive \nFourth Amendment law than within that of standing.\"  439 U.S. at 140.  Nevertheless, the \nnomenclature of \"standing\" is still commonly used by lower courts when addressing whether an \nindividual can assert a Fourth Amendment claim. \n58 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 59 of 97\nWells, 739 F.3d 511, 522-23 (10th Cir. 2014) (holding that an individual lacked a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in his communications while in another person's hotel room). \n1.  Senders ofe lectronic communications do not retain a reasonable \nexpectation ofp rivacy in communications once they arrive at their \ndestination \nThe Supreme Court has long held that when one person voluntarily discloses information to \nanother, the first person loses any cognizable interest under the Fourth Amendment in what the \nsecond person does with the information.  See United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (1976); \nCouch v.  United States, 409 U.S. 322, 335 (1973); White, 401 U.S. at 752 (plurality opinion); Hoffa \nv.  United States, 385 U.S. 293, 302-03 (1966).  For Fourth Amendment purposes, the same principle \napplies whether the recipient intentionally makes the information public or stores it in a place subject \nto a government search.  Thus, once a non-U.S. person located outside the United States receives a \ncommunicatfon, the sender loses any cognizable Fourth Amendment rights with respect to that \ncommunication.  That is true even ifthe sender is a U.S. person protected by the Fourth Amendment, \nbecause he assumes the risk that the foreign recipient will give the communication to others, leave \nthe communication freely accessible to others, or that the U.S. government (or a foreign \ngovernment) will obtain the communication.36 \nThis rule applies to physical mail, even within the United States.  Although the Fourth \nAmendment protects sealed letters in transit, \"once a letter is sent to someone, 'the sender's \nexpectation of privacy ordinarily terminates upon delivery.\"'  United States v. Gordon, 168 F.3d \n36 The \"recipient\" in this context refers to the ultimate recipient, not (for example) an internet service \nprovider.  See United States v.  Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 282-88 (6th Cir. 2010).  Thus, while \nWarshak held that a subscriber has a reasonable expectation of privacy in emails that the provider \nstores in the subscriber's account, it did not say that a person's Fourth Amendment rights are \nimplicated when the government obtains, from the service provider, emails from someone else's \naccount. \n59 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 60 of 97\n1222, 1228 (10th Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v. King, 55 F.3d 1193, 1196 (6th Cir. 1995)). \nThe same rul~ applies to email users, who lack \"a legitimate expectation of privacy in an email that \nhad already reached its recipient.\"  Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 333 (6th Cir. 2001); see also United \nStates v. Perrine, 518 F.3d 1196, 1204-05 (10th Cir. 2008) (noting that an individual \"may not ... \nenjoy ... an expectation of privacy in transmissions over the Internet or email that have already \narrived at the recipient\") (citation omitted); United States v. Lifshitz, 369 F .3d 173, 190 (2d Cir. \n2004) (noting that a sender of email, like a letter-writer, would lose an objective expectation of \nprivacy in email that the recipient had received). \n2.  CLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n3.  CLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n4.  Any remaining expectation ofp rivacy in the international \ncommunications at issue was significantly diminished \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nFinally, the principles underlying the \"border search\" doctrine are also relevant to this \nCourt's weighing of the individual's privacy interests relative to the government's interests in this \ncontext.  Co~s have long recognized the government's paramount interest in examining persons \nand property entering or exiting the country.  Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. at 152.  In that context, \"not \n~ \nonly is the expectation of privacy less,\" but also \"the Fourth Amendment balance between the \ninterests of the government and the privacy right of the individual is also struck much more \nfavorably to the Government.\"  United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 539-40 \n(1985) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, under the rubric of the \"border search\" doctrine, courts have \n60 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 61 of 97\nlong recognized a diminished expectation of privacy in letters or packages that transit an \ninternational border, even where the search takes place in the interior of the country.  See United \nStates v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606, 620 (1977) (holding that the border search exception applies to \ninternational letters, because \"[t]he critical fact is that the envelopes cross the border ... not that \nthey are brought in by one mode of transportation rather than another\"); United States v. Seljan, 54 7 \nF.3d 993, 1003 (9th Cir. 2008) (\"An envelope containing personal correspondence is not uniquely \nprotected from search at the border.\"); United States v. King, 517 F.2d 350, 354 (5th Cir. 1975) \n(\"Appellants here could have had no reasonable expectation that their letters, mailed from abroad, \nwould remain uninspected.\"). \nThe same rationale applies also to international data transmissions, like the communications \nat issue here, because such transmissions, in the form of terrorist communications, cyber attacks, \nillegal financial transactions, and the like, may implicate national security or other government \ninterests to a similar degree as physical mail in an envelope.  See Seljan, 54 7 F .3d at 1001-03 \n(upholding suspicionless search of envelope containing personal correspondence in light of \n\"tempered\" expectation of privacy in international mail and the government's interest in \"regulating \nthe flow of persons and property across the border\").  Although the government does not contend \nthat the Section 702 collection here was per se reasonable under the border search doctrine, the point \nremains that the principles underlying that doctrine support the constitutional reasonableness of the \ncollection at issue in this case because, at a minimum, privacy expectations are sharply reduced in \ntheir context.37 \n37 Any expectations of privacy defendants may have had in their electronic communications with \nnon-U.S. persons overseas were also diminished by the prospect that their foreign correspondents \ncould be targets for surveillance by foreign governments or private entities, whose activities are not \ngoverned by the United States Constitution or federal law, or by the U.S. Government, pursuant to \n61 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 62 of 97\nc.  The Privacy Interests of U.S. Persons Are Protected by Stringent \nSafeguards and Procedures \nThe government employs multiple safeguards that are designed to ensure that surveillance is \nappropriately targeted at non-U.S. persons located outside the United States for foreign intelligence \npurposes and to protect the privacy interests of U.S. persons who communicate with targets or whose \ncommunications are otherwise incidentally collected.  These safeguards and procedures - some of \nwhich go beyond what courts have held reasonable in the context of \"special needs\" warrantless \nsearches involving less compelling governmental interests - provide constitutionally sufficient \nprotection for the privacy interests of U.S. persons. \n1.  Senior officials certifo that the government's procedures satisfy \nstatutory requirements \nSection 702 requires the DNI and the Attorney General to certify that procedures are in place \nto protect the privacy of U.S. persons, including targeting procedures and minimization procedures. \n50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a), (g), and (i).  In addition, the DNI and Attorney General must also certify, inter \nalia, that a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information, that \nthe Attorney General and DNI have adopted guidelines to ensure compliance with the statutory \nlimitations in Section 702(b ), and that the targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and \nvarious authorities applicable to foreign intelligence surveillance conducted abroad.  Cf Clapper, \n133 S. Ct. at 1149 (noting that the government conducts surveillance of persons abroad under \n\"programs that are governed by Executive Order 12333\" and that \"[t]he Government may also \nobtain information from the intelligence services of foreign nations\"); Amnesty Int 'l USA v. Clapper, \n667 F.3d 163, 192 (2d Cir. 2011) (Raggi, J., dissenting) (Because \"the United States is hardly the \nonly government conducting electronic surveillance,\" the foreign contacts of plaintiffs challenging \nthe FAA might \"be prime targets for surveillance by other countries,\" especially foreign contacts \n\"believed to be associated with terrorist organizations.\"); Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 278 \n(Kennedy, J.,. concurring) (noting the relevance of \"differing and perhaps unascertainable \nconceptions of reasonableness and privacy that prevail abroad\").  This reality, which courts have \nacknowledged, arguably put defendant \"on notice ... that some reasonable [government] intrusion \non his privacy is to be expected.\" King, 133 S. Ct. at 1969. \n62 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 63 of 97\nguidelines adopted by the government are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.  50 U.S.C. § \n1881a(g)(2)(A).  The requirement that these senior executive branch officials certify that the \nprocedures comply with statutory requirements and with the Constitution represents an important \n\"internal check\" on the actions of the Executive Branch.  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 739. \n2.  Targeting procedures ensure that the government targets only non-US. \npersons reasonably believed to be outside the United States \nSection 702 provides that the targeting procedures must be \"reasonably designed\" to \"ensure \nthat any acquisition authorized under [the certification] is limited to targeting persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States\" and to \"prevent the intentional acquisition of any \ncommunication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the \nacquisition to be located in the United States.\" See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(d)(l).  The FISC repeatedly \nhas found that the targeting procedures employed by the government meet that standard.  See supra \nPart V.B.; {Caption Redacted], 2011WL10945618, at *6 (\"The Court found in those prior dockets \nthat the targeting and minimization procedures were consistent with the requirements of 50 U.S.C. § \n1881(d)-(e) and with the Fourth Amendment.\"). \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nThese detailed procedures refute defendants' contention that collection under Section 702 is \nunreasonably broad because the government \"could collect all communications\" between entire \ngeographical areas, such as \"New York and London\" as long as the \"nominal\" or \"ostensible\" targets \nwere foreign citizens outside the United States.  (Defs. Mot. 25).  Those contentions amount to an \naccusation that the government will not abide by the required procedures, despite extensive \noversight, and that the government will engage in \"reverse targeting\" of U.S. persons, even though \nthat is expressly prohibited by the statute, see 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(b)(2).  However, as the FISA Court \n63 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 64 of 97\nof Review recognized, there is a \"presumption of regularity\" that \"supports the official acts of public \nofficers,\" and unless there is \"clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly \ndischarged their official duties.\"  In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011.  In this case, as set forth more \nfully infra at Part IV .D. l .a, there is no indication of any non-compliance by the government that \nwould rebut that presumption.38 \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n3.  Minimization procedures protect the privacy of US. persons \nwhose communications are acquired \nSection 702 requires the government to employ minimization procedures, as defined in FISA, \nto limit the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of information concerning U.S. persons.  See 50 \nU.S.C. § 180l(h)(l).  Section 702 further requires that the FISC review those procedures and \ndetermine that acquisitions in accordance with such procedures would be consistent with the FAA \nand the Fourth Amendment.  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(l) and (2). \nThe minimization procedures governing Section 702 collection, some of which have recently \nbeen declassified, are appropriately designed to minimize the acquisition, retention, and \ndissemination of information to, from, or about U.S. persons, consistent with the government's \nforeign intelligence needs.  See Minimization Procedures Used by the National Security Agency in \nConnection with Acquisitions ofF  oreign Intelligence Pursuant to Section 702 oft he Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended, October 31, 2011 ), available at \nwww.dni.gov/files/documents/Minimization%20Procedures%20used%20by%20NSA%20in%20Con \nnection%20with%20FISA %20SECT%20702. pdf (\"NSA 2011 Minimization Procedures\"). 39  The \n38 \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n39 \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n64 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 65 of 97\nprocedures further require, among other things, that the identity of U.S. persons be redacted from \nintelligence reports prior to dissemination unless the information constitutes foreign intelligence \ninformation, is necessary to understand foreign intelligence information, or is evidence of a crime. \nId. § 6(b ).  In other words, the procedures by design aim to ensure that any intrusion on the privacy \nof U.S. persons is reasonably balanced against the government's intelligence and law enforcement \nneeds. \nFor the same reasons that courts have found the use of minimization procedures to be an \nimportant factor in holding traditional FISA surveillance to be reasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment, In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 740-42, the use of substantially similar minimization \nprocedures supports the reasonableness of surveillance under Section 702.  In re Directives, 551 \nF.3d at 1015 (finding it \"significant,\" in upholding the PAA, that \"effective minimization procedures \nare in place\" to \"serve as an additional backstop against identification errors as well as a means of \nreducing the impact of incidental intrusions into the privacy of non-targeted United States \npersons.\").40 \nDefendants contend (Defs. Mot. 40) that the minimization procedures are inadequate, despite \ntheir similarity to the procedures used in Title I FISA surveillance, because \"minimization [under the \nFAA] is not individualized but programmatic; minimization procedures apply not to surveillance of \nspecific targets but rather to surveillance programs, the specific targets of which may be known only \nto the executive branch.\"  To the contrary, Congress has recognized that the application of uniform \nminimization procedures to collection directed against multiple targets actually enhances the \nprotection of U.S. person information.  H. Rep. No. 95-1283, Pt. 1, at 75 (\"It is the intention of the \ncommittee that minimization procedures be as uniform as possible for similar surveillances ....

Abu-Jihaad, 531 F. Supp. 2d 299, 303 n.4 (D. Conn. 2008), ajf'd 630 F.3d 102 \n(2d Cir. 2010) (noting that \"the Attorney General has adopted standard minimization procedures that \napply to every [Title I] FISA application\"); In re All Matters Submitted to Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Ct., 218 F. Supp. 2d 611, 615 (FISC 2002) (referring to \"Standard Minimization \nProcedures for a U.S. Person Agent of a Foreign Power that are filed with the Court, which we \ncontinue to approve\").  The sufficiency of the minimization procedures therefore does not depend on \nthe identity of the particular target, but rather on whether the procedures are reasonably designed \"in \nlight of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance, to minimize the acquisition and \nretention, and prohibit the dissemination\" of information about United States persons consistent with \nthe government's need to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.  50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1801(h)(l), 1821(4)(A); see 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(e)(l). \nDefendants further contend (Defs. Mot. 39) that the minimization procedures \"bear little \nresemblance\" to the Title I FISA procedures and permit the government to conduct \"unfettered\" \nsurveillance.  However, the procedures employed here provide materially equivalent protection to \nthe procedures employed for Title I and III FISA  collection, and courts have found that these \nprocedures sufficiently protect the privacy interests of U.S. persons whose communications are \nincidentally acquired.  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 740-41; see In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015 \n(recognizing as \"significant\" to the Court's finding that acquisitions under the PAA were reasonable, \nthat \"effectiv~ minimization procedures are in place\" that were \"almost identical\" to those used in \ntraditional FISA surveillance).  In addition, those procedures have repeatedly been found sufficient \n66 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 67 of 97\nin the context of traditional FISA electronic surveillance and physical searches, which target U.S. \npersons in the United States and therefore are more likely to capture communications of non-targeted \nU.S. persons than the foreign communications targeted under Section 702.  See [Caption Redacted], \n2011 WL 10945618, at *7. \nDefendants also argue (Defs. Mot. 40) that the minimization is inadequate because the FISC \nlacks authority to supervise the government's compliance with minimization procedures.  However, \nthe FAA' s oversight provisions require regular reporting to the FISC concerning the government's \nimplementation of minimization procedures.  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(l).  In addition, Rule 13 of the \nFISC's Rules of Procedures requires the government to report, in writing, all instances of non \ncompliance.41  In response to such reports, the FISC has authority to disapprove or to require \n42 \namendments to the minimization procedures, as, indeed, the FISC has done. \nDefendants further contend (Defs. Mot. 18, 39) that the minimization procedures are \ninadequate because they permit the government to query information already collected pursuant to \n43 \nSection 702 using terms associated with U.S. persons. Defendants are incorrect. \nCourts have held in various contexts that where the government's querying of information \nthat has lawfully been obtained does not implicate any reasonable expectation of privacy beyond that \nimplicated in the initial collection, merely running queries in a database does not infringe on any \nsignificant privacy interest or trigger any fresh constitutional analysis.  See Boroian v. Mueller, 616 \nF.3d 60, 67-68 (1st Cir. 2010) (\"[T]he government's retention and matching of [an individual's] \nprofile against other profiles in [a DNA database] does not violate an expectation of privacy that \n41 \nFISC R.

Quander, 440 F.3d 489, 498-99 (D.C. Cir. 2006) \n(holding that .\"accessing the records stored in the [DNA] database is not a 'search' for Fourth \nAmendment purposes\" based in part on cases holding that, where a photograph is \"taken in \nconformance with the Fourth Amendment, the government's storage and use of it does not give rise \nto an independent Fourth Amendment claim.\").  Notably, the Sixth Circuit has applied this principle \nin the foreign intelligence context.  Jabara v.  Webster, 691 F.2d 272, 277-79 (6th Cir. 1982) \n(holding, where plaintiff did not challenge the lawfulness of warrantless NSA interception of his \nforeign communications but challenged only the subsequent dissemination of the communications to \nthe FBI, that such dissemination \"after the messages had lawfully come into the possession of the \nNSA\" did not implicate any reasonable expectation of privacy).44 \nThe same reasoning applies here.  Where, as here, the government has lawfully collected \nforeign intelligence information pursuant to statutory requirements and FISC-approved procedures \nthat meet Fourth Amendment standards, the government's subsequent querying of that information \ndoes not amount to a significant further intrusion on privacy that implicates the Fourth Amendment. \nSee King, 133 S. Ct. at 1980 (holding, \"in light of the scientific and statutory safeguards\" governing \nMaryland's warrantless collection of DNA from persons arrested for serious offenses, that \"once \n44 A rule that-every query, dissemination, or use of Section 702-obtained information amounts to a \nseparate search under the Fourth Amendment would not only be contrary to these cases but also \nwould be impracticable, because, as the Sixth Circuit explained in Jabara, such a rule would require \n\"a succession of warrants as information, lawfully acquired, is passed from one agency to another.\" \n691 F.2d at 279; see also id at 277 (\"Evidence legally obtained by one police agency may be made \navailable to other such agencies without a warrant, even for a use different from that for which it was \noriginally taken.\") (citation omitted).  Accordingly, \"[A]n expectation that information lawfully in \nthe possession of a government agency will not be disseminated, without a warrant, to another \ngovernment agency is [not] an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as \nreasonable.\"  Id. at 279. \n68 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 69 of 97\nrespondent's _DNA was lawfully collected,\" the subsequent analysis of the DNA \"did not amount to \na significant invasion of privacy that would render the DNA identification impermissible under the \nFourth Amendment\").  Accordingly, the government's querying (whether using U.S. person \nidentifiers or otherwise) of information lawfully obtained pursuant to Section 702 does not amount \nto a separate search under the Fourth Amendment and does not require separate or additional judicial \nprocess. \nFinally, the fact that minimization procedures may permit the government to query \ninformation lawfully collected pursuant to Section 702 using identifiers associated with U.S. persons \ndoes not render those procedures constitutionally unreasonable.  First, as noted above, the querying \nof information that the government lawfully has obtained is not a significant additional intrusion on \na person's privacy, beyond the level of intrusion that has already resulted from the government's \ncollection and review of the information pursuant to court-approved targeting and minimization \nprocedures.  Consistent with those procedures, the government is of course permitted to review the \ninformation it lawfully collects under Section 702 -which includes information concerning U.S. \npersons - to assess whether the information should be retained or disseminated.  Accordingly, U.S.-\nperson information is, by necessity, already subject to review (and use) under the FISC-approved \nminimization procedures.  It would be perverse to authorize the unrestricted review of lawfully \ncollected information but then to restrict the targeted review of the same information in response to \ntailored queries.  Querying lawfully collected information using U.S.-person identifiers does not \ninvolve a significant additional intrusion on a person's privacy, beyond the level of intrusion already \noccasioned by the government as it reviews and uses information it lawfully collects under Section \n702 pursuant to its need to analyze whether the information should be retained or disseminated. \n69 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 70 of 97\nOn the other side of the balance, the government has a powerful interest in conducting such \nqueries for appropriate purposes including, for example, discovering potential links between foreign \nterrorist groups and persons within the United States in order to detect and disrupt terrorist attacks. \nSee Part III.A.3.a.45  Similarly, the government's interest in preventing crime is \"paramount,\" and a \ncriminal investigation is always a \"compelling\" state interest.  Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, \n700 (1972); see also In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1011 (\"A surveillance with a foreign intelligence \npurpose ofte~ will have some ancillary criminal-law purpose\" because, for example, the \n\"apprehension of terrorism suspects ... is inextricably intertwined with the national security \nconcerns that are at the core of foreign intelligence collection.\").  Likewise, the FISC repeatedly has \napproved minimization procedures that permit queries using U.S. person identifiers.  See {Caption \nRedacted), 2011WL10945618, at *7.  In approving such queries in the context of Section 702 \ncollection, the FISC noted that the minimization procedures applicable to certain other FISA-\nacquired information, which the FISC had previously approved, similarly permit queries using U.S.-\nperson identifiers, even though that information was likely to include a higher concentration of U.S. \nperson information than Section 702 collection.  Id  The FISC concluded, \"[i]t follows that the \nsubstantially-similar querying provision found [in] the amended NSA minimization procedures \nshould not be problematic in a collection that is focused on non-United States persons located \noutside the United States and that, in the aggregate, is less likely to result in the acquisition of \nnonpublic information regarding non-consenting United States persons.\" Id. 46 \n45 Such queries also help the government counteract operational security measures such as hiding \noperational communications in large amounts of non-operational communications in the hope of \ndelaying the government's detection of those communications. \n46 \nCLASSIFiED MATERIAL REDACTED \n70 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 71 of 97\nIn other words, electronic surveillance under Title I of FISA is more likely to result in \nincidental collection of information about U.S. persons as to whom there has been no finding of \nprobable cause that an individual is an agent of a foreign power.  Yet the FISC has long approved the \nquerying of Title I data, including with U.S. person identifiers, when such queries are designed to \nyield foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime.  Likewise, for decades the Federal \nWiretap Act's minimization procedures have specifically allowed the government to search for and \nuse evidence from a wiretap to prove a crime unrelated to the original purpose for the wiretap.  See \n18 U.S.C. § 2517(5); see also, e.g., United States v. Goffer, 721 F.3d 113, 124 (2d Cir. 2013).  In \nsum, the government's querying of information lawfully acquired under Section 702 pursuant to the \ncourt-approved minimization procedures is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, as the FISC \nhas repeatedly found. \n4.  A significant purpose oft he acquisition must be to obtain foreign \nintelligence information \nSection 702 only authorizes collection when a \"significant purpose\" of the collection is to \n\"obtain foreign intelligence information.\"  50 U.S.C. § 188la(g)(2)(A)(v).  That requirement \nprecludes the government from using directives issued under Section 702 \"as a device to investigate \nwholly unrelated ordinary crimes.\"  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 736. \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n5.  Executive Branch, Congressional, and Judicial oversight \nSection 702 requires the Attorney General and DNI to periodically assess the government's \ncompliance with both the targeting and minimization procedures and with relevant compliance \nguidelines, including, for example, the extent to which U.S. persons' communications have been \nacquired under the statute and the number of intelligence reports stemming from Section 702 \n71 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 72 of 97\nl \nacquisitions referring to the identity of a U.S. person.  See 50 U.S.C. § 188la(l).  They must submit \nI \nthose assessments both to the FISC and to congressional oversight committees.  Id.  The Attorney \nI \nGeneral must also keep the relevant oversight committees \"fully inform[e d]\" concerning the \nl \nimplementation of Section 702.  50 U.S.C. § 188lf(a) and (b)(l); see also Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at \n' \n1144 (\"Surveillance under § 1881 a is subject to statutory conditions, judicial authorization, \ncongressional supervision, and compliance with the Fourth Amendment.\"). \nIn 2012, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, following four years of such oversight, \nfound that \n[T]he  assessments,  reports,  and  other  information  obtained  by  the  Committee \ndemonstrate that the government implements the FAA surveillance authorities in a \nresponsible manner with relatively few incidents of non-compliance.  Where such \nincidents  have  arisen,  they  have  been the  inadvertent  result  of human  error  or \ntechnical defect and have been promptly reported and remedied.  Through four years \nof oversight, the Committee has not identified a single case in which a government \nofficial engaged in a willful effort to circumvent or violate the law.  Moreover, having \nreviewed opinions by the FISA Court, the Committee has also seen the seriousness \nwith which the Court takes its responsibility to carefully consider Executive Branch \napplications for the exercise of FAA surveillance authorities. \nS. Rep. No. 174, 112th Cong. 2d Sess. 7 (2012); see also H.R. Rep. No. 645(II), 112th Cong., 2d · \nSess. 4 (\"The oversight this committee has conducted since the FAA was enacted in 2008 has shown \nno evidence that the Intelligence Community has engaged in any intentional or willful failure to \ncomply with statutory requirements or Executive Branch policies and procedures.\").  Under the \nFAA, as in traditional FISA, the \"in-depth oversight of FISA surveillance by all three branches of \ngovernment\" helps to \"ensure[]\" the \"privacy rights of individuals\" and to \"reconcile national \nintelligence and counterintelligence needs with constitutional principles in a way that is consistent \nwith both national security and individual rights.\"  United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 148 (D.C. \nCir. 1982). \n72 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 73 of 97\nI \n6.  Prior Judicial review \nFinally, Section 702 requires the FISC to enter an order approving the certification and the \nuse of the targeting and minimization procedures if the court finds that the certification contains all \nthe required elements, and that the targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with the \nrequirements of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881a(d) and (e) and with the Fourth Amendment.  50 U.S.C. § \n1881a(i)(3)(A).  The requirement of prior FISC approval, and in particular the requirement of a \njudicial finding that the government's targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with the \nFourth Amendment, support a finding that Section 702 collection conducted pursuant to such \nprocedures is constitutional.  See Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1150 (noting the importance of the \nrequirement that the FISC \"assess whether the Government's targeting and minimization procedures \ncomport with the Fourth Amendment\"); see also Clapper, 667 F.3d at 190 (Raggi, J., dissenting) \n(\"There is no reason to think that the Article III judges who serve on the FISA court will be timid in \nexercising this review authority\").  Indeed, the FISC's declassified opinions make clear that the \nFISC takes seriously its responsibility to independently review the constitutional reasonableness of \nthe applicable procedures and subjects those procedures to exacting scrutiny.  See, e.g., [Caption \nRedacted], 2011WL10945618. \nd.  Collection Under Section 702 Has Sufficient Particularity \nDefendants' overarching argument is, in essence, that collection pursuant to Section 702 fails \nthe Fourth Amendment's general reasonableness test because it does not require a particularized \ncourt order or finding of probable cause as in traditional FISA collection or domestic law \nenforcement wiretaps under Title III.  (Defs. Mot. 33-42).  In doing so, defendants characterize \nSection 702-authorized collection as \"dragnet\" surveillance that collects communications in \"bulk.\" \n(See, e.g., id. at 11, 16, 32, 42).  However, collection under Section 702 is not bulk collection. \n73 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 74 of 97\nRather, it is targeted and particularized because FISC-approved procedures require the government \nto determine (1) that the particular \"user of the facility to be tasked for collection is a non-United \nStates person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States,\" [Caption Redacted], \n2011 WL 10945618, at *7; and (2) the collection is designed to obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation within the scope of the certification approved by the court.47 \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nMoreover, defendants' argument conflates the test for constitutional reasonableness with the \ndifferent requirements for a warrant under the Fourth Amendment.  See U.S. Const. Amend IV \n(\"[N]o warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or Affirmation, and \nparticularly describing the place to be searched) (emphasis added).  In In re Directives, the FISA \nCourt of Review emphatically rejected the petitioner's \"invitation to reincorporate into the foreign \nintelligence exception the same warrant requirements that we already have held inapplicable.\"  551 \nF .3d at 1013.  Although particularity may be considered as one factor among many in assessing the \n47 Indeed, a review of \"transparency reports\" recently published by various U.S. Internet Service \nProviders demonstrates that collection of communications' content pursuant to FISA orders and \nFAA directives is far from bulk \"dragnet\" surveillance.  For example, Microsoft reported receiving \n\"fewer than 1,000 FISA orders\" (which Microsoft defines to include both traditional FISA orders \nand FAA directives that were received or active during the reporting period) that related to between \n16,000 and 16,999 user accounts during the six-month period between July and December 2012.  See \nBrad Smith, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Microsoft, \nProviding additional transparency on US. government requests for customer data (Feb. 3, 2014), \navailable at, http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_ on_t he_i ssues/archive/2014/02/03/providing \nadditional-transparency-on-US-government-requests-for-customer-data.aspx.  A particular user may \nhave multiple accounts, so this \"does not necessarily mean that more than [16,000] people were \ncovered by these data requests.\"  Id.  Rather, \"this number will likely overstate the number of \nindividuals subject to government orders.\"  Id.  The number of user accounts impacted by the same \nnumber of orders during other six-month reporting periods was even less, namely up to 15,999 \nbetween January and June 2013 and up to 11,999 between July and December 2011 and January to \nJune 2012.  Id. When balanced against the \"hundreds of millions\" of Microsoft customers, \"only a \nfraction of a percent of [Microsoft] users are affected by these orders.  In short, this means that we \nhave not received the type of bulk data requests that are commonly discussed publicly regarding \ntelephone records.\"  Id. \n74 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 75 of 97\nreasonableness of a particular search, the Fourth Amendment \"imposes no irreducible requirement\" \nof individualized suspicion where the search is otherwise reasonable, as it is here.  See King, 133 S. \nCt. at 1969.  Moreover, as the FISA Court of Review found in the context of the PAA, the \"matrix of \nsafeguards,\" including robust targeting and minimization procedures, provide constitutionally \nsufficient protections for the same interests that would be served by requirements of particularity or \nprior judicial review of individual targets.  In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1013. \nIn sum, in enacting Section 702, Congress and the Executive Branch developed a framework \nof procedures to facilitate collection of foreign intelligence vital to the nation's security while \nprotecting any constitutionally protected privacy interests implicated by the collection.  That \nframework is entitled to the utmost constitutional respect by this Court.  See Youngstown, 343 U.S. \nat 635-37 (Jackson, J., concurring); Jn re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1016 (\"[W]here the government has \ninstituted several layers of serviceable safeguards to protect individuals against unwarranted harms \nand to minimize incidental intrusions, its efforts to protect national security should not be frustrated \nby the courts.\").  The safeguards built into the statute and the certifications and procedures by which \nit was implemented here ensured that the collection targeted only foreign person(s) outside the \nUnited States and was conducted in a way that only incidentally implicated the privacy of U.S. \npersons.  Evaluating the totality of the circumstances and weighing the compelling governmental \ninterests at stake in combination with the extensive safeguards employed by the government to \nprotect the privacy interests of U.S. persons - including (1) certifications by Executive Branch \nofficials concerning the permissible foreign intelligence purposes of the collection; (2) targeting \nprocedures designed to ensure that only non-U.S. persons abroad are targeted; (3) minimization \nprocedures to protect the privacy of U.S. persons whose communications are incidentally acquired; \n(4) the requirement of a significant purpose to obtain foreign intelligence information; (5) extensive \n75 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 76 of 97\noversight wit~in the Executive Branch, as well as by Congress and the FISC; and (6) a prior judicial \nfinding that the targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with the Fourth Amendment-\nthis Court should hold that the government's acquisition pursuant to Section 702 of the foreign \nintelligence information challenged by the defendants meets the Fourth Amendment's central \nrequirement of reasonableness. \nB.  SECTION 702 IS CONSISTENT WITH ARTICLE III \nDefendants contend (Defs. Mot. 44-48) that the FISC does not perform a proper judicial role \nunder Article III in reviewing targeting and minimization procedures pursuant to Section 702 \nbecause the court does not review the procedures in the context of a particular proposed target and \ninterception.  Defendants further maintain that review at this level of generality does not present a \n\"case or controversy\" within the meaning of Article III.  Those contentions have no merit. \n\"Article III courts perform a variety of functions not necessarily or directly connected to \nadversarial proceedings in a trial or appellate court.\"  Mistretta v.  United States, 488 U.S. 361, 389 \nn.16 (1989); see also Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 679 n.16 (1988).  In particular, the courts \nhave long participated in the oversight of government searches and surveillance by reviewing \nwarrant and wiretap applications, notwithstanding that these proceedings are wholly ex parte and do \nnot occur at the behest of an aggrieved party as ordinarily required for a \"case or controversy\" under \nArticle III.

Congress's decision to vest the FISC with jurisdiction to review the \nreasonableness of procedures for searches or surveillance under the FAA is perfectly consistent with \nthe traditional function of Article III courts in protecting the privacy rights of persons whose \ninterests are potentially implicated by proposed searches, seizures, or compulsory processes.  Cf \nMistretta, 488 U.S. at 390-91 (given the judiciary's traditional role in determining individual \ncriminal sentences, the judiciary could constitutionally participate in formulating general sentencing \nguidelines). \nMoreover, the decision the FISC is called upon to render under Section 702 is not merely \n\"advisory,\" any more than a decision on a traditional search warrant or wiretap application is \n\"advisory.\" If the FISC disapproves the government's proposed targeting or minimization \nprocedures under Section 702, that decision has legal effect, because it bars the government from \n48 The judiciary participates in oversight of searches and seizures not only by reviewing applications \nand issuing warrants, but also through its participation in promulgating the procedural rules \ngoverning the warrant process.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41;  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 387-88 (noting that \nCongress may properly delegate to the courts the authority to prescribe rules of procedure in \ncriminal cases). \n77 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 78 of 97\nconducting .collections under the statute if it does not remedy the deficiency within thirty days.  A \nFISC order approving the proposed certification and procedures also has an effect on third parties, \nbecause it authorizes the government to issue directives (compulsory process analogous to a \nsubpoena) to electronic communications service providers.  The fact that the providers have a right \nto challenge a directive in court further establishes that a FISC order approving a Section 702 \ncertification is not an advisory opinion but a legally enforceable order potentially subject to legal \nchallenge.  See Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1154 (\"[A]ny electronic communications service provider that \nthe Government directs to assist in§ 188la surveillance may challenge the lawfulness of that \ndirective before the FISC. \"). \nI \nDefendants are also incorrect in claiming that the lack of a particular factual context for the \nI  FISC's review of the government's certification renders the issue inappropriate for resolution by an \nArticle III judge.  Even the authority on which defendants rely recognizes that the standard is \nI \nwhether the questions presented to the FISC \"are in a form such that a judge is capable of acting on \nthem.\"  United States v. Megahey, 553 F. Supp. 1180, 1197 (E.D.N.Y. 1982). That standard is met \nhere. \nSection 702 requires the FISC to review specific targeting and minimization procedures to \ndetermine whether they comply with applicable statutory standards and the Fourth Amendment. \ni \nThat review is not conducted in the abstract; rather, the FISC must review the minimization \nl \nprocedures \"in light of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance.\"  50 U.S.C. § \n' \n180l(h)(l) (emphasis added); see also id. § 1821(4)(A) (requiring that minimization procedures with \n1 \nrespect to physical search must be \"reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the \n,··. \n'·  particular physical search\") (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the FISC's review must consider the \n.I\ni \nparticular \"purpose,\" as set forth in the certification, of the acquisitions, as well as the particular \nI \n78 \ni \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 79 of 97\n''technique[s]\" the government uses.  This often involves a close consideration of the application of \nspecific, detailed provisions in the targeting and minimization procedures as applied to specific, \ntechnical tools through which the government implements Section 702.  See [Caption Redacted], \n2011 WL 10945618, at *9 (\"The Court has repeatedly noted that the government's targeting and \nminimization procedures must be considered in light of the communications actually acquired.\"). \nThat level of particularity and detail is exemplified in the declassified FISC opinions addressing the \nadequacy of particular targeting and minimization procedures in the context of certain technical \nlimitations in the NSA's \"upstream collection\" of Internet communications transmitted as part of a \nmulti-communication batch.  See id. at *9-* 10. \nAnalyzing the reasonableness of electronic surveillance, in light of the government's national \nsecurity interests and the privacy interests of potential subjects of the surveillance, is a traditional \njudicial function.  See Halperin v. Kissinger, 606 F.2d 1192, 1201 n.59 (D.C. Cir. 1979) \n(\"[D]etermin[ing] whether electronic surveillance was consonant with statutory and constitutional \nstrictures [is] a traditional judicial function that is governed by well established and manageable \nstandards.\").  The closely related question of whether surveillance conducted pursuant to particular \nprocedures is reasonable under the relevant statutory and constitutional standards is also the kind of \nanalysis that courts regularly undertake, such as, for example, when they adjudicate the \nconstitutionality of a state statute regulating domestic wiretaps.  See United States v. Tortorello, 480 \nF.2d 764, 772-73 (2d Cir. 1973) (analyzing constitutional adequacy of procedures provided by New \nYork electronic surveillance statute). \nThe FISC's role under Section 702 is also analogous to judicial review of administrative \nwarrants in the public health context, which may be based on the court's determination of the \nreasonableness of the standards and procedures for conducting inspections in a given area, rather \n79 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 80 of 97\nthan evidence of a violation at a specific location.  See Camara v. Municipal Ct., 387 U.S. 523, 537-\n38 (1967) (\"Such standards, which will vary with the municipal program being enforced, may be \nbased upon the passage of time, the nature of the building (e.g., a multifamily apartment house), or \nthe condition of the entire area, but they will not necessarily depend upon specific knowledge of the \ncondition of the particular dwelling.\").  Although warrant or wiretap applications for law \nenforcement purposes typically involve a more fact-specific form of review, that is because the \nFourth Amendment or Title III requires more particularity in those contexts - not because of \nanything in Article III. \nC.  THE GOOD FAITH EXCEPTION APPLIES \nThe good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule set forth in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. \n897, 913 (1984), provides an independent basis for denying defendants' suppression motion.  See, \ne.g., United States v. Ning Wen, 477 F.3d 896, 897-98 (7th Cir. 2007) (applying good-faith exception \nto a claim that FISA surveillance violated the Fourth Amendment).  The good-faith rule applies \nwhen law enforcement agents act in \"objectively reasonable reliance on a statute\" authorizing \nwarrantless searches that is later deemed unconstitutional, Ill. v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 349-50 (1987), \nwhen law enforcement officers reasonably rely on the probable-cause determination of a neutral \nmagistrate, see Leon, 468 U.S. at 920, and when law enforcement officers reasonably rely on then \nbinding appellate precedent that is subsequently overturned, see Davis v.  United States, 131 S. Ct. \n2419, 2434 (2011). \nThe good-faith exception applies here because the collection at issue was authorized by a \nduly enacted statute, an order issued by a neutral magistrate, and court of appeals precedent.  First, \ngovernment agents conducted the collection at issue here pursuant to Section 702, as well as under \nprocedures adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to the statute.  See Krull, 480 U.S. at 349; \n80 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 81 of 97\nDuka, 671 F.3d at 346 (reasoning that the good-faith rule applies because the search \"was conducted \nin objectively reasonable reliance on a duly authorized statute [PISA]\"); see also United States v. \nMarzook, 435 F. Supp. 2d 778, 790-91 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (holding that \"the FBI's reliance on the \nAttorney Ge~eral's approval under Executive Order 12333 - an order that no court has found \nunconstitutional - was []objectively reasonable because that order pertains to foreign intelligence \ngathering\").  Second, the agents also reasonably relied on orders issued by neutral magistrates - the \njudges of the FISC - who repeatedly have held that the applicable targeting and minimization \nprocedures are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  See Leon, 468 U.S. at 920; see also Duka, \n671 F.3d at 347 n.12 (\"[O]bjective ... reliance on the statute in this case is further bolstered by the \nfact that the particular provision at issue has been reviewed and declared constitutional by several \ncourts.\"); United States v. Mubayyid, 521 F. Supp. 2d 125, 140 n.12 (D. Mass. 2007) (applying the \ngood-faith exception because \"there appears to be no issue as to whether the government proceeded \nin good faith and in reasonable reliance on the PISA orders\").  Finally, the agents reasonably relied \non appellate precedent from the PISA Court of Review that upheld similar directives issued under \nthe PAA.  See Davis, 131 S. Ct. at 2433-34; In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1016. \nDefendants cannot show that Section 702 is so \"clearly unconstitutional,\" Krull, 480 U.S. at \n349, that \"a reasonable officer should have known that the statute was unconstitutional,\" id. at 355. \nNor can they show that the collection was the result of \"systemic error or reckless disregard of \nconstitutional requirements.\"  Herring v.  United States, 555 U.S. 135, 147 (2009).  Accordingly, \neven if the collection were deemed unconstitutional, the evidence derived from that collection would \nnot be subject to exclusion.49 \n49 In the related context of Title III of the Wiretap Act, the weight of the precedent establishes that \nTitle Ill's statutory suppression remedy for criminal wiretap orders incorporates the good-faith \n81 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 82 of 97\nIV.  THE SECTION 702 INFORMATION WAS LAWFULLY ACQUIRED AND \nCONDUCTED IN CONFORMITY WITH AN ORDER OF \nAUTHORIZATION OR APPROVAL \nIn addition to challenging the general constitutionality of Section 702, defendants also \nquestion the government's compliance with the applicable targeting and minimization procedures \nwith respect to the specific information used in this case.  (Defs. Mot. 39-40).  As explained below, \nthis Court's in camera, ex parte review of the relevant classified materials will establish that the \nSection 702 acquisition was lawfully authorized and conducted.  First, the applicable certification(s), \ntargeting procedures, and minimization procedures, all of which were reviewed and approved by the \nFISC, complied with the requirements for such certification(s) and procedures set forth in Section \n702.  Second, the Section 702 collection at issue in this case was conducted in accordance with those \napproved certification( s) and procedures. \nA.  CLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nexception.  See United States v. Moore, 41 F.3d 370, 374, 376 (8th Cir. 1994) (applying good-faith \nexception to Title III violation); United States v. Malekzadeh, 855 F.2d 1492, 1497 (I Ith Cir. 1988) \n(same); United States v. Brewer, 204 Fed. Appx. 205 (4th Cir. 2006) (same); United States v. \nSolomonyan, 451 F. Supp. 2d 626, 637-38 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (collecting cases).  Although two courts \nof appeals have held otherwise, both courts also questioned in those cases whether the government's \nactions were actually taken in \"good faith,\" either because the affiant recklessly misled the court, see \nUnited States v. Rice, 478 F.3d 704, 709-11 (6th Cir. 2007); or because the wiretap order, in the \ncourt's view, plainly violated the applicable rule, see United States v. Glover, 736 F.3d 509, 515-16 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013).  In this case, even if some aspect of the collection did not comply with the \nrequirements of Section 702, there is no similar indication of deliberate, reckless, or systemically \nnegligent conduct.  Accordingly, absent a finding that the government personnel who carried out the \ncollection did not rely in good faith on the targeting and minimization procedures as approved by the \nFISC, or otherwise engaged in culpable conduct warranting application of the exclusionary rule, \ndefendants' motion to suppress should be denied. \n82 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 83 of 97\nB.  THE APPLICABLE TARGETING PROCEDURES MET THE STATUTORY \nREQUIREMENTS \nSection 702 targeting procedures must be \"reasonably designed\" both to \"ensure that any \nacquisition authorized [pursuant to Section 702] is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed \nto be located outside the United States\" and to \"prevent the intentional acquisition of any \ncommunication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the \nacquisition to be located in the United States.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(d)(l). \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nC.  THE APPLICABLE MINIMIZATION PROCEDURES MET THE \nSTATUTORY REQUIREMENTS \nSection 702 requires the adoption of minimization procedures that comply with FISA's \ndefinition of such procedures.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(e)(l).  That definition in turn requires that the \nminimization procedures must be reasonably designed, in light of the purpose and technique of the \nparticular surveillance, in order to minimize any acquisition of non-publicly available information \nabout unconsenting U.S. persons, and to minimize the retention and prohibit the dissemination of \nany such info.rmation that might still be acquired, consistent with the need to obtain, produce, and \ndisseminate foreign-intelligence information, or to retain and disseminate evidence of a crime.  50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1801(h)(l), (3), 1821(4)(A), (C), 1881a(e)(l). \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \nD.

DEFENDANTS' DISCOVERY MOTION SHOULD BE DENIED \nDefendants request discovery on a number of theories: (1) that disclosure is required under \nthe Due Process Clause (Defs. Mot. 48); (2) that adversarial proceedings are required either because \nof the uniqueness of the legal issues, a lack of precedent, on the defendants' supposition that they \nwould craft better arguments if they knew more about the underlying classified information, on the \nbasis of so-called misrepresentations to the FISC, or on the argument -previously rejected by this \ncourt in CIP A proceedings - that ex parte proceedings are disfavoured or inconsistent with due \nprocess (Defs. Mot. 49-60); and (3) the argument that a suppression motion cannot be crafted \n85 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 86 of 97\nwithout discl~sure - an argument which is undercut by years of precedent to the contrary (Defs. Mot. \n48). For the reasons set forth below, the defendants' request for discovery of classified material \nshould be denied. \nA.  FISA PROVISIONS GOVERNING REVIEW AND DISCLOSURE \nFISA provides that, where the Attorney General certifies that \"disclosure [of FISA materials] \nor an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States,\" a district court \n\"shall, notwithstanding any other law, ... review in camera and ex parte the application, order, and \nsuch other materials relating to the surveillance as may be necessary to determine whether the \nsurveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1806(t). \nThis same procedure applies to motions related to Section 1881 a collection, which is deemed to be \nTitle I FISA surveillance for purposes of such motions.  50 U.S.C. § 1881e(a).  If the Attorney \nGeneral files such a declaration, as he has done here, the district court must review the FISA \nmaterials ex parte and in camera and may disclose the applications and orders (or portions thereof) \n\"only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the \nsurveillance [or search].\" Id (emphasis added). \nAccordingly, FISA requires the court to examine the applications, orders, and related \nmaterials ex parte and in camera to determine the lawfulness of the Section 702 collection.  Id.  If \nthe court is able to assess the legality of the FISA collection by reviewing the government's \nsubmissions (and any supplemental materials that the court may request) in camera and ex parte, it \nmust deny a request for disclosure to the defense. See, e.g., United States v. El-Mezain, 664 F.3d \n467, 565 (5th Cir. 2011); Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 129; United States v. Damrah, 412 F.3d 618, 624 \n(6th Cir. 2005); United States v. Squillacote, 221 F.3d 542 (4th Cir. 2000); United States v. Badia, \n827 F.2d 1458, 1464 (11th Cir. 1987); United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir. 1982). \n86 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 87 of 97\nA court may order disclosure only if it finds itself incapable of accurately resolving the lawfulness of \nthe FISA collection.  El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at 567; Abu Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 129. \nB.  IN CAMERA, EX PARTE REVIEW OF THE FISA MATERIALS IS THE \nRULE \nIn light of these requirements, courts have consistently held that \"[d]isclosure ofFISA \nmaterials is the exception and ex parte, in camera determination is the rule.\"  El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at \n567 (citing Abu Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 129); United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 78 (2d Cir. 1984) \n(same); United States v. Rosen, 447 F. Supp. 2d 538, 546 (E.D. Va. 2006).  Whenever possible, \"the \ncourt should proceed in camera and without disclosure [of national security information] to \ndetermine the legality of a surveillance\" in order to avoid frustrating the system designed by \nCongress to protect the \"delicate and sensitive [process of] foreign intelligence gathering\" to the \ngreatest degree possible \"compatible with the assurance that no injustice is done to a criminal \ndefendant.\"  Belfield, 692 F.2d at 149 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re Grand Jury \nProceedings ofS pecial April 2002 Grand Jury, 34 7 F.3d 197, 203 (7th Cir. 2003) (noting that a case \nin which \"disclosure is necessary\" is \"one-in-a-million\"); Kris & Wilson, National Security \nInvestigations§ 29:3 n.1 (2d ed. 2012) (\"Necessary means \"essential\" or \"required,\" and therefore \nthe plain language of that provision makes clear that a court may not disclose ... unless it cannot \ndetermine whether the surveillance was unlawful without the assistance of defense counsel and an \nadversary hearing.\"). \nUntil recently, every court to have addressed a motion to disclose FISA applications and \norders or to suppress FISA information has been able to determine the legality of the challenged \nFISA collection based on an in camera, ex parte review. See, e.g., El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at 566 \n(quoting district court's statement that no court has ever held an adversarial hearing to assist the \n87 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 88 of 97\ncourt); but see United States v. Daoud, No. 12-cr-723, 2014 WL 321384 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 29, 2014) \n(unpublished) (granting motion for disclosure of PISA materials to defense counsel with security \nclearance). 50  Even where defendants have alleged specific errors or misrepresentations in the PISA \napplications, based on their analysis of the evidence in the case, courts have deemed disclosure \nunnecessary because they were able to adjudicate the lawfulness of the surveillance in light of the \nalleged errors through in camera, ex parte review. See, e.g., El-Mezain, 664 P.3d at 566; Abu Jihaad, \n630 P.3d at 130; Rosen, 447 P. Supp. 2d at 552 (denying disclosure despite minimization errors that \nwere inadvertent, disclosed to the PISC, and promptly rectified).  Thus, if this Court is able to \ndetermine the legality of the Section 1881a collection from which certain of the evidence in this case \nwas derived based on its ex parte, in camera review of the government's submission, then there will \nbe no legal basis to disclose any portion of such submission. \nC.  DEFENSE PARTICIPATION IS NOT NECESSARY TO THIS COURT'S \nREVIEW \nUnder these standards, the legality of the Section 702 collection at issue in this case may be \ndetermined without the need to compel disclosure of classified materials to the defense.  As the \ngovernment's submissions make clear, the Section 702 collection was lawful and the defendants' \nallegations to the contrary may be considered, and rejected, based on an examination of the \nclassified record.  Contrary to defendants' contention, the classified record presents none of the \nissues that may warrant disclosure, such as \"indications of possible misrepresentation of fact, vague \nidentification of the persons to be surveilled, or surveillance records which include a significant \namount of nonforeign intelligence information, or any other factors that would indicate a need for \ndisclosure in this case.\"  United States v. Ott, 827 P.2d 473, 476 (9th Cir. 1987). \n50 The government appealed the district court's order in Daoud, and the district court stayed its order \npending appeal. \n88 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 89 of 97\nD.  DEFENDANTS' ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF DISCLOSURE \nCONTRAVENE FISA'S STANDARDS AND OTHERWISE LACK MERIT \nDefendants contend (Defs. Mot. 50-51) that the Court should grant disclosure because his \nmotion presents \"factually and legally complex\" issues that the Court must resolve \"without the aid \nof precedent.\"51  That contention has no merit. \nAn order granting disclosure based simply on the fact that a FISA claim raises issues that \nhave not previously been adjudicated would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.  After all, at \nthe time FISA was enacted, every FISA suppression motion would have raised novel issues, yet \nCongress mandated that FISA litigation be handled ex parte, in camera, with disclosure the \nexception.  Courts have been following that procedure for decades.  E.g., In re Grand Jury \nProceedings,'347 F.3d at 203; El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at 567; Abu Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 129; Duggan, \n743 F.2d at 78.  Moreover, the statute requires that courts review the FISA applications and orders in \ncamera and ex parte before even contemplating disclosure.  Thus, a court's decision to disclose \nshould arise from that review, rooted in facts from the FISA materials, and not from a defendant's \ncontention that his case raises novel issues. \nIn Belfield, the D.C. Circuit squarely rejected an attempt to compel disclosure on similar \ngrounds. In that case, the defendants asserted that \"[q ]uestions as to the legality of surveillance \nconducted under FISA are far too complex to be determined without disclosure and adversary \nproceedings.\"  692 F.2d at 147.  However, the court recognized that an argument relying on the \ngeneral complexity of FISA issues would apply in every case, and therefore disclosure would always \nbe \"necessary.\" Id.  That view, the Court declared, \"cannot be correct\" \"as a matter of statutory \ninterpretation\" because \"[t]he language of section 1806(f) clearly anticipates that an ex parte, in \n51 \nIn asserting the lack of any helpful precedent, Muhtorov again fails to mention the decision of the \nFISA Court of Review in In re Directives. \n89 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 90 of 97\ncamera determination is to be the rule.  Disclosure and an adversary hearing are the exception, \noccurring only when necessary.\"  Id. (emphasis in original).  Thus, Muhtorov's arguments conflict \nwith Belfield, the clear statutory standard governing disclosure, and the process set forth in FISA for \nreview of FISA suppression claims. \nThe defendants note (Defs. Mot. 52) that, \"without disclosure,\" the Court and the defendants \nwill \"lose the benefit of informed arguments\" from the defense.  However, as noted above, whether \ndisclosure might assist the defendants in effectively presenting their claims is not the relevant \nstandard.  FI$A requires a finding by the Court, after an ex parte, in camera review, that disclosure \n\"is necessary\" for the Court to \"make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.\" \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(f); see Kris & Wilson, National Security Investigations§ 29:3 n.l (2d ed. 2012) \n(describing legislative history of another FISA provision in which Congress emphasized that the \nterm \"necessary\" meant \"important and required,\" and not simply \"useful or convenient\"). \nMoreover, the defendants' contention runs counter to the policy judgment Congress made in \ndevising FISA's suppression procedures.  The advantages of the adversary process were not lost on \nCongress, but Congress weighed those benefits against the exceptional costs of revealing \"sensitive \nforeign intelligence information.\"  S. Rep. No. 701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 57 (1978); see also \nBelfield, 692 F.2d at 148 (noting that Congress was \"aware\" of the difficulties of ex parte \nprocedures, but that Congress made a \"thoroughly reasonable attempt to balance the competing \nconcerns of individual privacy and foreign intelligence.\").  If a defendant could obtain disclosure \nmerely by pointing out that it would help him formulate his arguments more effectively, disclosure \nwould become the norm, circumventing Congress's intentions and upsetting decades of case law. \nSee Belfield, 692 F.2d at 146-48 (noting that Congress \"was adamant\" that the \"carefully drawn \ni \n1 \nl \n90 \nI \nI \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 91 of 97\nprocedures\" of§ 1806(f) were not to be \"bypassed by the inventive litigant using a new ... judicial \nconstruction\") (citing S. Rep. No. 701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 63).52 \nDefendants contend (Defs. Mot. 52) that courts have suggested that factors such as \"possible \nmisrepresentations of fact, vague identification of the persons to be surveilled, or surveillance \nrecords which include a significant amount of non-foreign intelligence information,\" indicate that an \nadversary hearing may be warranted.  They further contend that the government's \"repeated \nmisrepresentations to the FISC\" establish the presence of those factors.  (Defs. Mot. 52).  However, \nthe defendants fail to recognize that, to justify disclosure, the court must first find that those factors \nare present with respect to the collection at issue in a particular case, after, in camera, ex parte \nreview.  See Ott, 827 F.2d at 476 (noting that there are \"no indications of possible misrepresentation \nof fact, vague identification of the persons to be surveilled, or surveillance records which include a \nsignificant amount of non-foreign intelligence information, or any other factors that would indicate a \nneed for disclosure in this case) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added); United States \nv.  Warsame, 547 F. Supp. 2d 982, 987-88 (D. Minn. 2008) (noting that defendant's allegations that \n\"the government has included misstatements and critical omissions in other FISA applications not at \nissue here cannot justify disclosure in this case\"). 53 \n52  A prior version of the bill that became FISA would have allowed disclosure of the applications \nand orders \"if there is a reasonable question as the legality of the surveillance and if disclosure \nwould likely promote a more accurate determination of such legality or if such disclosure would not \nharm the national security.\" House Report at 10. That version, however, was not enacted by \nCongress. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1720, 31-32, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. \nNews 4048, 4060-61. \n53 The defendants' argument that they are entitled to a Franks hearing suffers from the same \nweakness. Defs. Mot. 56-57. A defendant cannot establish entitlement to a Franks hearing based on \nevidence of misrepresentations in some other case.  If that were true, every defendant would be \nentitled to a Franks hearing simply by pointing to alleged misrepresentations in a different case. \n91 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 92 of 97\nNor do the defendants' citations to statements in various FISC opinions, most of which do \nnot involve Section 702, justify ordering disclosure of the Section 702 materials.  Apart from the fact \nthat those opinions have virtually no relevance to the present case, they underscore a more \nsignificant fact:  the government takes its obligations under FISA and the Constitution seriously and \ncandidly acknowledges and corrects deficiencies and compliance problems when it discovers them. \nSee Comments of the Judiciary on Proposals Regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n(Jan. 10, 2014) at 5, 7 (noting that the government generally exhibits a \"high degree of candor\" in ex \nparte proceedings before the FISC and that the government \"routinely discloses in an application \ninformation that is detrimental to its case\"), available at \nwww.judiciary.senate.gov/resources/d ocuments/113thCongressDocuments/upload/O11413 RecordSu \nb-Grassley.pdf.  To the extent that there are any issues concerning the lawfulness of the Section \n1881a collection at issue, as raised in FISC opinions, those have been addressed in this pleading. \nMuhtorov's speculation therefore cannot overcome the statutory presumption favoring this Court's \n.  54 \nex parte review. \n54 None of the FISC opinions cited by the defendants have any bearing on the issues surrounding the \nuse of information derived from the acquisition of foreign intelligen~e information conducted \npursuant to Section 702 in this case.  Only one FISC opinion cited by the defendants relates in any \nway to the acquisition of foreign intelligence information under Section 702.  See [Caption \nRedacted], 2011 WL 10945618.  The defendants' reliance on that opinion, however, is misplaced. \nThat opinion ·does not alter Section 1806' s requirement that the district court first conduct an in \ncamera, ex parte review of the government's submissions and only order disclosure if necessary to \ndetermine the legality of the Section 702 collection at issue.  Moreover, the concerns expressed in \nthat opinion applied only to one particular collection technique under Section 702, not to Section 702 \ncollection as a whole, which the FISC approved as lawful.  See id. at * 14, 28.  Thus, if that technique \nis not at issue in this case, then the FISC opinion supports the proposition that Section 702 collection \nis constitutional. \nCLASSIFIED MATERIAL REDACTED \n92 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 93 of 97\nThe defendants' contend that disclosure of the Section 702  materials is required under Brady \nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), on the ground that the materials \"likely\" will contain \"information \nfavorable\" to the motion to suppress. Defs. Mot. 57-59. The government understands and has every \nintention of complying with its discovery obligations.  The defendants are not entitled to go on a \n\"fishing expedition\" of the government's files on the mere supposition that they may contain \nexculpatory information. That contention has no merit. \nWhere disclosure is not necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the \nsurveillance, FISA prohibits disclosure \"except to the extent that due process requires discovery or \ndisclosure.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1806(g).  The due process requirement embraced by FISA is coterminous \nwith the Brady standard.  See United States v. Spanjol, 720 F. Supp. 55, 59 (E.D. Pa. 1989). \nHowever, contrary to defendants' speculation, none of the Section 702 materials submitted herewith \nare \"material\" within the meaning of Brady.  The defendants' argument that due process requires \ndisclosure of FISA materials based on the defendants' allegation that the materials \"likely\" will \nassist them in litigating their suppression motion would, again, apply in every FISA case and is \ntherefore inconsistent with the numerous cases upholding FISA's ex parte review procedure against \nconstitutional challenges. See, e.g., El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at 567-69; Damrah, 412 F.3d at 624-25; \nUnited States. v. Isa, 923 F.2d 1300, 1306-07 (8th Cir. 1991); Ott, 827 F.2d at 476-77; Belfield, 692 \nF.2d at 148.  Likewise, even if, as the defendants contend (Defs. Mot. 59), FISA's due process \ndisclosure requirement incorporates the \"relevant and helpful\" standard from the CIP A context, \nrather than the more stringent Brady standard, the Section 702 materials are not discoverable under \neither standard. \nFinally, the defendants contend that adversary process is required in this context by the \nConstitution's due process, right to counsel, and confrontation clauses. Defs. Mot. 61-64. As noted \n93 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 94 of 97\nabove, that contention is inconsistent with decades of practice in FISA litigation and numerous cases \nupholding FISA's in camera, ex parte procedures against constitutional challenges.  Muhtorov's \nargument also founders on the large body of non-FISA law allowing courts to hold ex parte, in \ncamera hearings when necessary to protect an informant's safety, the integrity of an ongoing \ninvestigation, or some other important interest.  See Isa, 923 F.2d at 1307; United States v. Falvey, \n540 F. Supp. 1306, 1315 (E.D.N.Y. 1982).  Indeed, even before FISA came into existence, the \nSupreme Court authorized the adjudication of electronic surveillance in camera, ex parte.  See \nTaglianetti v.  United States, 394 U.S. 316, 317 (1969) (per curiam) (\"Nothing [in the Supreme Court \nprevious decisions] requires an adversary proceeding and full disclosure for resolution of every issue \nraised by an electronic surveillance\"); Giordano v.  United States, 394 U.S. 310, 314 (1969) (\"Of \ncourse, a finding by the District Court that surveillance was lawful would make disclosure and \nfurther proceedings unnecessary.\").  More generally, the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly declined to \nrequire the use of adversarial procedures to make probable cause determinations.\" Kaley v.  United \nStates, 134 S. Ct. 1090, 1103 (2014).  In accordance with those principles, the government's \nundeniable interest in protecting ongoing national security investigations and intelligence sources \nand methods, coupled with the protections found in other parts of FISA, justifies limiting the \ndefendants' right to review the FISA applications and orders.  See Isa, 923 F.2d at 1307. \nAccordingly, defendants' request for discovery should be denied. \nVI.  DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO A HEARING UNDER FRANKS v. \nDELAWARE \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to a Franks hearing based on purported \nmisrepresentations in the applications that led to the orders under which Muhtorov's \ncommunications were seized\" and because of some perceived failure of the FISC to bar the \n94 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 95 of 97\ndefendants' surveillance. Defs. Mot. 56, 62. For the reasons given below, the court should deny this \nrequest. \nWhen a defendant makes the requisite showing, the Court may conduct a Franks hearing to \ndetermine if there are material misrepresentations of fact, or omissions of material fact, before the \nFISC sufficient to warrant suppression of evidence obtained or derived from Title I and Title III \nFISA collections.  See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 171 (1978); Ning Wen, 477 F.3d at 897. \nTo merit a Franks hearing, the defendant first must make a \"concrete and substantial preliminary \nshowing\" that: (1) the affiant deliberately or recklessly included false statements, or failed to include \nmaterial information, in the affidavit; and (2) the misrepresentation was essential to the finding of \nprobable cause.  Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56; United States v. Colkley, 899 F.2d 297, 301 (4th Cir. \n1990); Duggan, 743 F.2d at 77 & n.6; United States v. Kashmiri, 2010 WL 4705159, *5 (N.D. Ill. \n2010) (defendant \"has not made any showing-let alone a substantial one - that an Executive \nBranch officer knowingly and intentionally, or recklessly, included a false statement in the FISA \napplication [and w]ithout such a showing, he is foreclosed from obtaining a hearing\").  Failure of the \ndefendant \"to satisfy either of these two prongs proves fatal to a Franks hearing.\" Id. at *5; \nMubayyid, 521 F. Supp. 2d at 130-31. \nThe defendants' burden in establishing the need for a Franks hearing is a heavy one.  United \nStates v. Jeffus, 22 F.3d 554, 558 (4th Cir. 1994).  The defendant must submit allegations of \ndeliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, accompanied by an offer of proof.  Franks, \n438 U.S. at 171.  Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient, id., as are \nallegations of insignificant or immaterial misrepresentations or omissions.  Colkley, 899 F. 2d at \n301-02.  Moreover, a defendant's lack of access to the FISA applications and orders is not an \nadequate substitute for the required showing.  Although this situation presents a quandary for \n95 \nI \nf \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 96 of 97\ndefense counsel when FISA-derived evidence comes into play, Congress and the courts have \nrecognized that such difficulty does not justify the disclosure ofFISA materials: \nWe appreciate the difficulties of appellants' counsel in this case.  They must argue \nthat t~e determination of legality is so complex that an adversary hearing with full \naccess to relevant materials is necessary.  But without access to the relevant materials \ntheir claim of complexity can be given no concreteness.  It is pure assertion. \nCongress was also aware of these difficulties.  But it chose to resolve them through \nmeans other than mandatory disclosure.  In FISA Congress has made a thoroughly \nreasonable  attempt to  balance  the  competing  concerns  of individual  privacy  and \nforeign intelligence . . . . Appellants are understandably reluctant to be excluded from \nthe process whereby the legality of a surveillance by which they were incidentally \naffected is judged.  But it cannot be said that this exclusion rises to the level of a \nconstitutional violation. \nBelfield, 692 F.2d at 148; see also Kashmiri, 2010.WL 4705159, at *6: \nNevertheless, to challenge the veracity of the FISA application, Defendant must offer \nsubstantial proof that the FISC relied on an intentional or reckless misrepresentation \nby  the  government  to  grant  the  FISA  order.  The  quest  to  satisfy  the  Franks \nrequirements might feel  like a wild-goose chase, as Defendant lacks access to the \nmaterials that would provide this proof.  This perceived practical impossibility to \nobtain a hearing, however, does not constitute a legal impossibility. \n(U) Defendants cannot show that material misrepresentations or omissions of material fact \nregarding Section 702 collection were deliberately or recklessly made to the FISC because there \nwere none.  Other courts have rejected similar attempts by defendants to force a Franks hearing \nchallenging the validity ofFISA orders based on speculation.  See Kashmiri, 2010 WL 4705159, at \n*6 (noting that the court \"has already undertaken a process akin to a Franks hearing through its ex \nparte, in camera review\"); United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 531 F. Supp. 2d at 31 O;  United States v. \nHassoun, No. 04-CR-60001, 2007 WL 1068127, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 4, 2007); Mubayyid, 521 F. \nSupp. 2d at 130-31.  This Court likewise should reject defendants' attempt to hold a Franks hearing \nin this case without making the proper showing. \n96 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 97 of 97\nVII.  CONCLUSION \nBased on the above discussion and analysis, the government requests that the Court deny \ndefendants' Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained or Derived from Surveillance Under the FISA \nAmendments Act and Motion for Discovery. \nRespectfully submitted this 9th day of May 2014. \nJOHN WALSH \nUnited States Attorney \nIsl Gregory Holloway \nAssistant United States Attorney \nDistrict of Colorado \nJOHN P.

JAMSHID MUHTOROV, \n    \nDefendant. \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \nDEFENDANT’S REPLY TO GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE (DOC. 559, 569) \n________________________________________________________________________ \n \nINTRODUCTION \nJamshid Muhtorov’s motion to suppress concerns the suspicionless and \nwarrantless surveillance of a U.S. person’s international communications under the FISA \nAmendments Act (“FAA”).  See Doc. 520.1 This surveillance violated the Fourth \nAmendment because it occurred without a warrant, without individualized suspicion, and \nunder a program that lacks the limitations that courts have deemed necessary for \nelectronic-surveillance regimes to be reasonable.  The surveillance also violated Article \nIII of the Constitution because it proceeded under programmatic orders issued by the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) absent any constitutional “case or \ncontroversy.”  As a remedy, this Court should suppress the fruits of that surveillance.   \n                                                           \n1 “Doc.” Refers to the Clerk’s Docket. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 34\nThe Court should permit Mr. Muhtorov discovery of evidence that would be \nhelpful and material to his defense and that would permit him to understand and \nchallenge the role that the FAA played in the government’s investigation of him. \nMr. Muhtorov will address each of the government’s arguments made in its \nresponse. However, it is important not to lose sight of the broader import of the \ngovernment’s theory.  The government’s theory is that Americans have no \nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in their international communications.  See \nDoc. 559 at 35.  To accept the government’s arguments is to accept that the National \nSecurity Agency may collect Americans’ international communications, individually or \nin bulk, “incidentally” or directly, without having to answer to the Constitution. Under \nthe government’s logic, the NSA may record every international phone call and copy \nevery international text message and email.  It may search those communications without \nlimitation—for evidence of criminal activity, for foreign-intelligence information, or for \nanything else the government may be interested in learning.  The government endeavors \nto obscure the implications of its theory; but to accept the theory is to accept a radically \nreimagined relationship between the governed and their government—one in which every \ncross-border missive, business transaction, or journalistic investigation takes place under \nthe all-seeing and all-remembering gaze of the executive. \nThere is a narrower path—one that would accommodate the government’s \nlegitimate foreign-intelligence interests but also protect the privacy of innocent \nAmericans and U.S. Persons.  Congress could prohibit the government from intentionally \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 34\nintercepting their international communications without a warrant, and require it to obtain \na warrant retroactively to retain any such communications obtained unintentionally.  \nNotably, then-Senator Obama proposed such a reform during the debate that preceded the \nenactment of the FAA.  A foreign-intelligence scheme would not interfere with the \ngovernment’s ability to monitor foreign-to-foreign calls and emails, and it would permit \nthe government to collect and retain Americans’ international communications with \njudicial authorization.  It would accommodate the government’s legitimate interest \nwithout encroaching unnecessarily—and unconstitutionally—on the privacy rights of \ninnocent Americans.  The scheme Congress chose, however—the scheme under which \nMr. Muhtorov’s communications were surveilled—differs greatly from this one.  It \nauthorizes exactly the suspicionless surveillance the Constitution was meant to forbid. \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE GOVERNMENT’S SURVEILLANCE OF MR. MUHTOROV’S \nCOMMUNICATIONS WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. \n \nA.  The government’s surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications \nviolated the Fourth Amendment. \n \ni.  The “incidental overhear” rule does not render the warrant \nrequirement inapplicable. \n \nThe government contends that “incidental capture of a U.S. person’s \ncommunications during surveillance that lawfully targets non-U.S. persons abroad” does \nnot engage the warrant clause.  Doc. 559 at 38.  But the rule the government cites—\nsometimes called the “incidental overhear” rule—has no application here.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 34\nFirst, the surveillance of Americans’ communications under the FAA is not merely \n“incidental.”  Intelligence officials who advocated passage of the FAA (and of the Protect \nAmerica Act (“PAA”) before it) indicated that their principal aim was to allow the \ngovernment broader authority to monitor Americans’ international communications.2  \nWhen legislators proposed language that would have required the government to obtain \nprobable-cause warrants before accessing Americans’ international communications, the \nWhite House issued a veto threat.3  One cannot reasonably say that the surveillance of \nAmericans’ communications under the FAA is “incidental” when permitting such \nsurveillance was the purpose of the Act.  \nNor can one reasonably say that the surveillance of Americans’ international \ncommunications is “incidental” when the FAA allows large-scale collection of those \ncommunications.  While the FAA prohibits “reverse targeting,” the prohibition is \nnarrow—it applies only if the government’s surveillance targets a “particular, known \n                                                           \n2 See, e.g., FISA for the 21st Century: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th \nCong. at 9 (2006), http://1.usa.gov/1kbgHm3 (statement of NSA Director Michael Hayden) \n(stating, with respect to the FAA’s predecessor statute, that certain communications “with one \nend . . . in the United States” are the ones “that are most important to us”); Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board (“PCLOB”), Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant \nto Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 114–15 (July 2, 2014), \nhttp://www.pclob.gov/All%20Documents/Report%20on%20the%20Section%20702%20Progra\nm/PCLOB-Section-702-Report.pdf (“PCLOB 702 Report”) (“Executive and legislative branch \nofficials have repeatedly emphasized to us that, with respect to terrorism, communications \ninvolving someone in the United States are some of the ‘most important’ communications \nacquired under the program.”) \n \n3 See Letter from Att’y Gen. Michael Mukasey & DNI John M. McConnell to Sen. Harry Reid, \nat 3–4 (Feb. 5, 2008), http://1.usa.gov/1ihhf9A. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 34\nperson reasonably believed to be in the United States.” 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(b)(2).  Outside \nthat narrow prohibition, the statute allows the government to conduct surveillance to \ncollect Americans’ international communications.  This is precisely how the government \nuses the statute, and the government has acknowledged not only that it collects \nAmericans’ communications under the statute but that it uses selectors associated with \nU.S. persons to search through the communications it collects.  See Letter from Deirdre \nM. Walsh, Dir. of Legislative Affairs, Office of the Dir. of National Intelligence, to Sen. \nRon Wyden (June 27, 2014), http://1.usa.gov/V8lYTo (“ODNI–Wyden Letter”) \n(acknowledging that various agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nconducted thousands of backdoor searches using U.S. identifiers in 2013 alone); Ellen \nNakashima, Obama Administration Had Restrictions on NSA Reversed in 2011, Wash. \nPost, Sept. 7, 2013, http://wapo.st/1hP9FWm.  The government relies heavily on In re \nDirectives, 551 F.3d 1004 (FISCR 2008), but in that case the FISC found it significant \nthat the government was not amassing the database it is concededly amassing here—let \nalone querying that database for information about Americans.  Id. at 1015 (“The \ngovernment assures us that it does not maintain a database of incidentally collected \ninformation from non-targeted United States persons, and there is no evidence to the \ncontrary.”).  \nSecond, the “incidental overhear” cases cited by the government involved \nsurveillance predicated on warrants—that is, they involved circumstances in which courts \nhad found probable cause regarding the government’s targets and had limited with \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 34\nparticularity the facilities and communications to be monitored.  See, e.g., United States \nv. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143 (1974); United States v. Figueroa, 757 F.2d 466 (2d Cir. 1985).  \nThe “incidental overhear” rule was invoked where a court had carefully circumscribed \nthe government’s surveillance and limited the government’s intrusion into the privacy of \nthird parties.  See United States v. Donovan, 429 U.S. 413, 436 n.15 (1977) (holding that \nwhile a warrant is not made unconstitutional by “failure to identify every individual who \ncould be expected to be overheard,” the “complete absence of prior judicial authorization \nwould make an intercept unlawful”); United States v. Yannotti, 399 F. Supp. 2d 268, 274 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2005) (finding lawful an incidental intercept because the government had \nobtained a judicial warrant that “did not give the monitoring agents unfettered discretion \nto intercept any conversations whatsoever occurring over the target cell phone”); PCLOB \n702 Report at 95 (“Where a wiretap is conducted in a criminal investigation pursuant to a \nwarrant, satisfaction of the three requirements of the warrant clause . . . renders the \nwiretap constitutionally reasonable—both as to the intended subjects of the surveillance \nand as to any persons who end up being incidentally overheard, the full range of whom \nthe government can never predict.”). \n   Surveillance conducted under the FAA is not similarly limited.  Quite the \nopposite:  the FAA does not require the government to establish probable cause or \nindividualized suspicion of any kind concerning its targets; it does not require the \ngovernment to identify to any court the facilities it intends to monitor; and it does not \nrequire the government to limit which communications it acquires—so long as the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 34\nprogrammatic purpose of its surveillance is to obtain foreign-intelligence information.  \nSurveillance is not particularized.  The rule of the “incidental overhear” cases cannot be \nextended to this context.  \n   Third, the volume of communications intercepted “incidentally” in surveillance \nunder the FAA differs dramatically from the volume of communications intercepted \nincidentally in surveillance conducted under original FISA or Title III.  Unlike original \nFISA and Title III, the FAA allows the government to monitor individuals without regard \nto whether those individuals are suspected criminals or foreign agents. PCLOB 702 \nReport 116 (“[T]he expansiveness of the governing rules, combined with the \ntechnological capacity to acquire and store great quantities of data, permit the \ngovernment to target large numbers of people around the world and acquire a vast \nnumber of communications.”).  Under the government’s theory, the statute even allows \nthe NSA to scan millions of people’s communications for information “about” the \ngovernment’s targets.  The government’s use of the term “incidental” conveys the \nimpression that its collection of Americans’ communications under the FAA is a de \nminimis byproduct common to all forms of surveillance.  But whereas surveillance under \nTitle III or the original FISA might lead to the incidental collection of a handful of \npeople’s communications, surveillance under the FAA invades the privacy of thousands \nor even millions of people.  See [Redacted], No. [Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *27 \n(FISC Oct. 3, 2011) (observing that “the quantity of incidentally-acquired, non-target, \nprotected communications being acquired by NSA through its upstream collection is, in \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 34\nabsolute terms, very large, and the resulting intrusion is, in each instance, likewise very \nsubstantial”); id. at *26 (“[T]he Court must also take into account the absolute number of \nnon-target, protected communications that are acquired.

California, Nos. 13-132 & 13-212, 2014 WL 2864483, \nat *13–16 (U.S. June 25, 2014) (recognizing that the broad collection of data raises \ndifferent constitutional questions); United States v.

Ct. at 954–57 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).4 \n  The government’s effort to stretch the incidental overhear doctrine to cover its \ndragnet collection of Americans’ communications reflects a view that constitutional rules \nand exceptions designed for an era of individualized surveillance can be applied willy-\n                                                           \n4 The district court in United States v. Mohamud erred in finding that incidental collection under \nthe FAA does not “differ sufficiently from previous foreign intelligence gathering to distinguish \nprior case law”—a finding upon which the court based its conclusion that the FAA “does not \ntrigger the warrant clause.”  See No. 3:10-CR-00475, 2014 WL 2866749, at *15 (D. Or. June 24, \n2014). Besides being from a different circuit, and not from a higher court, under 10th Cir. Rule \n32.1(A) while this decision, if unpublished, may be cited for its persuasive value, it is not \nprecedential.  \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 34\nnilly to vast programs of suspicionless surveillance.  This view is wrong.  See Riley, 2014 \nWL 2864483; Jones, 132 S. Ct. 945; United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276 (1983). \nThe government makes one further argument against application of the warrant \nrequirement:  It argues that it would be unworkable because “imposition of a warrant \nrequirement for any incidental interception of U.S. person communications would \neffectively require a warrant for all foreign intelligence collection.”  Doc. 559 at 39.  This \nis a red herring. The Fourth Amendment does not require the government to obtain prior \njudicial authorization for surveillance of foreign targets merely because those foreign \ntargets might, at some unknown point, communicate with U.S. persons.  But compliance \nwith the warrant clause requires at least two things: that the government avoid \nwarrantless acquisition of Americans’ international communications where it is \nreasonably possible to do so, and that it avoid warrantless review of such \ncommunications when it collects them inadvertently or incidentally.5 \n                                                           \n5 The NSA could easily implement the first restriction by automatically excluding American \nphone numbers or internet protocol addresses from its collection.  It could also exclude from its \ncollection any communications sent or received by accounts, addresses, or identifiers that it \nseparately has reason to believe are associated with U.S. persons.  The NSA apparently \nmaintains a list of such accounts, addresses, and identifiers to prevent targeting errors; there is \nno reason that it could not do the same to protect Americans’ privacy more fully. See Procedures \nUsed by the National Security Agency for Targeting Non–United States Persons Reasonably \nBelieved to Be Located Outside the United States to Acquire Foreign Intelligence Information \nPursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, As Amended 3 \n(July 28, 2009), https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/716633/exhibit-\na.pdf (“Furthermore, in order to prevent the inadvertent targeting of a United States person, NSA \nmaintains records of telephone numbers and electronic communications \naccounts/addresses/identifiers that NSA has reason to believe are being used by United States \npersons.”). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 34\nThere is no practical reason why these limitations—which have the effect of \nimposing a warrant requirement only for Americans’ international communications—\ncould not be imposed here.  During the debate that preceded the passage of the FAA, \nthen-Senator Barack Obama co-sponsored an amendment that would have codified these \nlimitations by prohibiting the government from (1) acquiring a communication without a \nwarrant if it knew “before or at the time of acquisition that the communication [was] to or \nfrom a person reasonably believed to be located in the United States,” and (2) accessing \nAmericans’ communications collected under the FAA without a warrant based on \nprobable cause.  See S.A. 3979, 110th Cong. (2008).  More recently, the President’s \nReview Group concluded that a warrant requirement should be imposed, and the House \nof Representatives passed an appropriations bill that would impose one. See PRG Report \n28–29; H.R. 4870, 113th Cong. § 8127 (2014). \nii.  Even if there is a foreign-intelligence exception, the exception is \nnot broad enough to make the surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov \nconstitutional. \n \nAs Mr. Muhtorov has explained, Doc. 520 at 27–30, there is no foreign-\nintelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirements of individualized \nsuspicion and a warrant.  Even if this exception existed it is not broad enough to make the \ngovernment’s surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov constitutional.  The cases the government \ncites involve a crucial limitation missing here:  the surveillance was directed at foreign \npowers or their agents and predicated on an individualized finding of suspicion.  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Duka, 671 F.3d 329, 338 (3d Cir. 2011); In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 34\n717, 720 (FISCR 2002); United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 915 (4th Cir. \n1980); see also Doc. 520 at 31–32 (discussing cases).  \nThe government relies heavily on In re Directives, 551 F.3d 1004 (FISCR 2008), a \ncase that only underscores Mr. Muhtorov’s point.  In re Directives addressed the \nconstitutionality of surveillance directives issued under the PAA, Executive Order \n12,333, and certain Defense Department regulations.  Although the PAA did not itself \nrequire individualized suspicion or particularity, the surveillance program considered by \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (“FISCR”) required both.  See id. \nat 1007 (“The certifications require certain protections above and beyond those specified \nby the PAA.”); id. at 1013–14 (describing a “matrix of safeguards” that included both a \nparticularity and probable cause requirement).  Throughout its opinion, the FISCR \nemphasized this point again and again, observing that “[c]ollectively, these procedures \nrequire a showing of particularity, a meaningful probable cause determination, and a \nshowing of necessity.”  Id. at 1016. \n While the FISCR recognized a foreign-intelligence exception to the warrant \nrequirement, that exception was narrow: \n[W]e hold that a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment’s \nwarrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign \nintelligence for national security purposes and is directed against foreign \npowers or agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 34\n551 F.3d at 1012 (emphasis added).  The surveillance considered by the FISCR was \npremised on an individualized finding of probable cause documented and certified by the \nAttorney General himself.  See In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1014.  \nThe foreign-intelligence exception the government proposes is far broader than the \none recognized by the FISCR in In re Directives.  Here, the government has invoked the \nforeign-intelligence exception not in defense of surveillance directed at “foreign powers \nor agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be located outside the United States,” \nbut in defense of a statute that permits surveillance directed at any non-citizen located \noutside the United States and that permits dragnet surveillance of Americans’ \ninternational communications without individualized suspicion or probable cause. The \nFISCR has never recognized a foreign-intelligence exception sweeping enough to render \nconstitutional the surveillance that Mr. Muhtorov challenges here.  See PCLOB 702 \nReport 90 n.411 (acknowledging that “it is not necessarily clear that the Section 702 \n[FAA] program would fall within the scope of the foreign-intelligence exception \nrecognized by [earlier] decisions, which were limited to surveillance directly authorized \nby the Attorney General, targeting foreign powers or their agents, and/or pursuing foreign \nintelligence as the primary or sole purpose of the surveillance”). \n   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 34\niii.  The surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications was \nunreasonable. \n \n No exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant and probable-cause \nrequirements applies here. Even if one did, however, the surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov \nunder the FAA would be unconstitutional as unreasonable.  See Doc. 520 at 33–34. \nThe FAA is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment because it exposes \nvirtually every American’s international communication to suspicionless and warrantless \nsurveillance.  See Doc. 520 at 33–43.  It  abandons the limits that courts have identified as \nkey to the constitutionality of electronic surveillance statutes, including FISA—\nindividualized suspicion, prior judicial review, and particularity.6  Rather than dealing \ndirectly with these defining features of the FAA, the government argues that the statute is \nsimilar to the surveillance program held reasonable in In re Directives; that it is justified \nbecause of the government’s overriding interest in countering terrorism; that Americans \nhave little to no expectation of privacy in their international communications; and that \n“multiple safeguards” make the FAA reasonable.    \nFirst, the government’s reliance upon In re Directives, see Doc. 559 at 54–55, is \nmisplaced.  The FISCR founded its ruling upon several factors that are absent here, \nincluding that, under the scheme considered, the government could acquire the \ncommunications only of “overseas foreign agents,” 551 F.3d at 1011; and the \n                                                           \n6 See In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1013 (“[T]he more a set of procedures resembles those \nassociated with the traditional warrant requirements, the more easily it can be determined that \nthose procedures are within constitutional bounds.”). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 34\ndetermination that each target was a foreign agent was made by the Attorney General \nhimself, id. at 1014.  Also significant to the reasonableness of the scheme, the FISCR \nsaid, was that the government did not “maintain a database of incidentally collected \ninformation from non-targeted United States persons.” Id. at 1015.7 \nNone of these factors is present here, and their absence is critical.  Because it \npermits the government to monitor any foreigner overseas and not just foreign agents, the \nFAA eliminates the primary criterion relied upon by every appellate court to find a \nscheme of foreign-intelligence surveillance reasonable: individualized suspicion.  By \ntransferring targeting authority away from the Attorney General of the United States, the \nFAA permits low-level NSA analysts to decide whom to target.  See also Glenn \nGreenwald, XKeyscore: NSA Tool Collects ‘Nearly Everything a User Does on the \nInternet’, Guardian, July 31, 2013, http://gu.com/p/3hy4h (describing interface through \nwhich NSA analysts can initiate FAA surveillance “by clicking a few simple pull-down \nmenus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications”).  And, finally, the \nFAA permits the government to assemble—and the government has assembled—“a \ndatabase of incidentally collected information from non-targeted United States persons.” \nAs explained in Mr. Muhtorov’s motion, Doc. 520 at 18, the government routinely uses \n                                                           \n7 The government compares the PAA to the FAA in a manner that suggests that In re Directives \nupheld the PAA facially. See Doc. 559 at 53–55. That is not so. The FISCR analyzed the PAA \nonly “as implemented” in the case before it. In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1009–10. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 34\nhis database, which contains hundreds of millions of communications, to target U.S. \npersons through so-called “backdoor searches.”  See also ODNI–Wyden Letter.  \nSecond, the government’s claim that the FAA is “crucial to the government’s \nefforts against terrorism and other threats,” Doc. 559 at 56, is an evasion.  Mr. Muhtorov \ndoes not challenge the government’s warrantless acquisition of foreign-to-foreign \ncommunications, only of foreign-to-U.S. communications.  The real question is whether \nthe government’s interest would be thwarted if it had to demonstrate individualized \nsuspicion or to obtain a warrant before acquiring or reviewing Americans’ \ncommunications. \nOn this question, the government’s brief is silent.  Instead, it claims with \ndeliberate vagueness that, in “‘54 counterterrorism investigations . . . information \nobtained under section 702 contributed in some degree to the success of the \ninvestigation.’”  Doc. 559 at 57 (emphasis added) (quoting PRG Report 144–45).  There \nare several problems with this argument.  As an initial matter, the government has not \nspecified the “degree” to which the FAA has contributed to its investigations.  In Senate \ntestimony, the government has admitted that only thirteen “had some nexus to the United \nStates.”  Continued Oversight of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: Hearing \nBefore the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 113th Cong. at 52:33 (2013), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/TPpSQb (Sen. Leahy: “Would you agree that the fifty-four cases that \nkeep getting cited by the administration were not all plots, and of the fifty four only \nthirteen had some nexus to the United States?  Would you agree with that, yes or no?”; \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 34\nKeith Alexander, Director, NSA: “Yes.”).  The government has not explained how \nrequiring that it demonstrate individualized suspicion or that it acquire a warrant in a \nhandful of cases over a five- or six-year period would frustrate its surveillance efforts, \nparticularly given that the government may conduct such surveillance without a warrant \nin exigent circumstances.8  \nThird, the government’s claim that Americans have no privacy interest in their \ninternational communications is without support.  See Doc. 559 at 35 (“the privacy \ninterests of U.S. persons in international communications are significantly diminished, if \nnot completely eliminated, when those communications have been transmitted to or \nobtained from non-U.S. persons located outside the United States”); see also id. at 58–61.  \nIf it were true that Americans had no expectation of privacy in their international \ncommunications, then the government could target those communications for \nsurveillance directly.  It could dispense altogether with the doublespeak of “incidental \ncollection” and collect and store all Americans’ every international call and email. \nAccepting this argument would mean the government has unfettered discretion to \nscrutinize every word that crosses the country’s borders.  The government appears to be \ndoing something along those lines by scanning every nearly cross-border communication \n                                                           \n8 The recently released report by the PCLOB also fails to address this question. It states that \n“[a]pproximately fifteen of the cases we reviewed involved some connection to the United \nStates,” PCLOB 702 Report 110, but it does not address whether requiring the government to \nobtain a warrant or demonstrate individualized suspicion when acquiring or reviewing \nAmericans’ communications would have prevented the government from investigating those \nfifteen cases.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 34\nfor information “about” its targets.  See Charlie Savage, NSA Said to Search Content of \nMessages to and From U.S., N.Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2013, http://nyti.ms/1cez5ZK; see also \nPCLOB 702 Report 121–22.  Neither doctrine relied upon by the government—the \nborder-search doctrine and the third-party doctrine, see Doc. 559 at 59–61—justifies such \nsweeping surveillance. \nThe border-search doctrine does not justify the surveillance of communications, \nand it does not justify the surveillance of them absent individualized suspicion.  The \ngovernment cites no cases suggesting that the doctrine even applies beyond the context of \nindividuals or property physically at a border.  The Supreme Court has clarified that the \ndoctrine exists to serve the government’s interest in “stopping and examining persons and \nproperty crossing into this country.”  United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606, 616 (1977) \n(emphasis added); accord United States v. Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. 149, 152 (2004).  In \nits seminal case on the matter, the Court noted that, under the regulations, “envelopes are \nopened at the border only when the customs officers have reason to believe they contain \nother than correspondence, while the reading of any correspondence inside the envelopes \nis forbidden.”  Ramsey, 431 U.S. at 624.  It is not a surprise that “[e]ven at the border, \n[courts have] rejected an ‘anything goes’ approach.”  United States v. Cotterman, 709 \nF.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 2013) (requiring reasonable suspicion before a thorough review of \na laptop at the border), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 899 (2014); see also Lamont v. Postmaster \nGen. of the United States, 381 U.S. 301 (1965) (invalidating registration requirement for \nrecipients of certain foreign mail). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 34\nThe government’s reliance upon the third-party doctrine is equally misplaced.  See \nDoc. 559 at 59–60.  Mr. Muhtorov unquestionably enjoys a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy in his communications, whether sent conventionally or using modern \ntechnologies.  See, e.g., United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 288 (6th Cir. 2010) (“a \nsubscriber enjoys a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of emails that are \nstored with, or sent or received through, a commercial ISP” (quotation marks omitted)). \nThe government’s argument, therefore, applies at most to a narrow subset of Mr. \nMuhtorov’s communications: those received by his foreign contacts (i.e., not in transit) \nand obtained by the government outside of the United States.  The argument would not \napply at all to FAA surveillance, which involves the acquisition of communications in \ntransit, received by U.S. persons, or residing on the servers of U.S. companies.  The \ngovernment’s argument amounts to an impermissible attempt to bootstrap away \nAmericans’ expectation of privacy in their international communications by focusing \nmyopically on only the foreign end of the communications.  \nFinally, the government claims the FAA is reasonable because of “multiple \nsafeguards” in place to protect Americans’ privacy.  Doc. 559 at 62–73.  As Mr. \nMuhtorov has explained in his motion to suppress, those supposed safeguards are weak \nand riddled with exceptions.  They permit the government to target virtually any \nforeigner for surveillance—even where another party to the communication is a U.S. \nperson, see Doc. 520 at 35–36; and, for the U.S. persons inevitably swept up by that \ninternational dragnet, the only safeguards are minimization procedures that provide little \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 34\nmeaningful protection, see Doc. 520 at 36–42.9  The government’s response inadequately \naddresses two key facts. \nFirst, while FAA surveillance is subject to minimization procedures, the \nminimization procedures do not account for the FAA’s failure to require individualized \njudicial review at the acquisition stage.  Under FISA and Title III, minimization operates \nas a second-level protection against the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of \ninformation relating to U.S. persons; the first level of protection comes from the \nrequirement of individualized judicial authorization for each surveillance target.  Under \nthe FAA there is no first-level protection, because the statute does not call for \nindividualized judicial authorization of surveillance targets (or of facilities to be \nmonitored or communications to be acquired).  Unlike FISA and Title III, the FAA \npermits dragnet surveillance of Americans’ international communications.  In this \ncontext, it is an indictment of the FAA, not a defense, to say, as the government does, that \nthe FAA’s minimization rules are analogous to the minimization rules that apply under \nFISA and Title III.10 \nSecond, unlike the surveillance at issue in In re Directives, FAA surveillance \npermits the government to “maintain a database of incidentally collected information \n                                                           \n9 The Supreme Court recently warned against excessive reliance on “government agency \nprotocols” to safeguard Americans’ privacy.  See Riley, 2014 WL 2864483, at *16 (“[T]he \nFounders did not fight a revolution to gain the right to government agency protocols.”). \n \n10 The government’s suggestion that Yahoo!’s challenge in In re Directives amounted to a full \nadversarial proceeding is unfounded.  See Doc. 559 at 54 n.33.  The court there was clear that it \nconsidered at least some of the relevant procedures on an ex parte basis. See 551 F.3d at 1013. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 34\nfrom non-targeted United States persons,” 551 F.3d at 1015, and to later search that \ndatabase using the names, email addresses, or other identifiers of U.S. persons.  The \ngovernment defends this practice—known as “backdoor searching”—by claiming this \npractice does not “implicate any reasonable expectation of privacy beyond that \nimplicated in the initial collection.”  Doc. 559 at 67.  This is incorrect.  The minimization \nprocedures in surveillance schemes are a part of the terms of access.  Courts uphold the \nreasonableness of the schemes—as with FISA and Title III—only if those terms are \nreasonable.  See Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 140–43 (1978) (reviewing \nsurveillance minimization practices for reasonableness); United States v. Ganias, No. 12-\n240, 2014 WL 2722618 (2d Cir. June 17, 2014) (suppressing evidence where government \nobtained files and searched them for information beyond the terms of the warrant).  Here, \nthe terms of access omit a limitation that the FISCR viewed as essential to the \nconstitutionality of a much narrower program.  See In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015.  If \nthe government were correct, then the “multiple safeguards” on which it rests its case \nwould be entirely superfluous as a constitutional matter.11  \n \n                                                           \n11 If the government conducted one or more backdoor searches of Mr. Muhtorov’s \ncommunications, that would violate both the Fourth Amendment and the FAA, and it would \nprovide an independent basis for suppression. The FAA prohibits the targeting of a foreigner \noverseas for the purpose of targeting “a particular, known person” inside the United States. 50 \nU.S.C. § 1881a(b)(2). Backdoor searching of the government’s extensive database of Americans’ \n“incidentally” collected communications violates this prohibition, and the Fourth Amendment, \nby enabling the surveillance of particular, known U.S. persons without a warrant.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 34\nB. The government’s warrantless surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov’s \ncommunications violated Article III. \n  The FAA violates Article III’s “case or controversy” requirement because the \nstatute requires FISC judges to issue advisory opinions addressing the constitutionality of \nabstract procedures absent concrete facts.  See Doc. 520 at 47.  It is plain that a federal \ncourt could not adjudicate, at the mere urging of the Denver Police Department, the \nconstitutionality of the department’s newly devised internal policies governing its \nofficers’ use of force.  Nor could a court take up a request by the Transportation Security \nAdministration to pass upon the reasonableness of new agency procedures concerning \nsecondary airport screening before their application to a particular passenger.  So too \nhere—and none of the government’s arguments to the contrary has merit. \nThe “case or controversy” requirement ensures that Article III courts do “not \nengage in adjudicatory or decisional functions except in those ‘cases’ and ‘controversies’ \nreferred to in Article III.”  Application of President’s Comm’n on Organized Crime, 763 \nF.2d 1191, 1203 (11th Cir. 1985) (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted).  By \nlimiting the jurisdiction of Article III courts to live, concrete disputes, the “case or \ncontroversy” requirement closes the courthouse doors to requests for advisory opinions or \n“abstract declaration[s] of the law.”  In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561, 567 (1945); see \nUnited States v. Fruehauf, 365 U.S. 146, 157 (1961) (characterizing advisory opinions as \n“advance expressions of legal judgment upon issues which remain unfocused because \nthey” lack “clear concreteness”).  As the Supreme Court recently explained, “[i]f a \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 34\ndispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or \nexpounding the law in the course of doing so.”  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. \n332, 341 (2006); see Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 \n(1948); United States v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., 200 F.3d 679, 699 (10th Cir. 1999).12 \n  The government misconstrues Mr. Muhtorov’s “case or controversy” argument—\nand it cites cases that rejected very different Article III challenges.  Mr. Muhtorov’s “case \nor controversy” argument has little in common with the failed Article III challenges in \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 \n(1989), which concerned congressional statutes granting executive and administrative \nfunctions to federal judges.  See Morrison, 487 U.S. at 680–82 (rejecting Article III \nchallenge to Congress’s assignment of administrative and executive functions to special \ncourt charged with role in the appointment of independent counsel); Mistretta, 488 U.S. \nat 411 (rejecting Article III challenge to “nonadjudicatory” functions of judges on U.S. \nSentencing Commission).  Likewise, Mr. Muhtorov’s argument is of a different flavor \nthan objections to the administrative role of Article III judges in promulgating federal \nrules of procedure.  See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 391.  And Mr. Muhtorov does not, like \n                                                           \n12 See also Norvell v. Sangre de Cristo Dev. Co., Inc., 519 F.2d 370, 375 (10th Cir. 1975) (“It is \nfundamental that federal courts do not render advisory opinions and that they are limited to \ndeciding issues in actual cases and controversies. A justiciable controversy is distinguished from \na difference or dispute of a hypothetical character or from one that is academic.” (citations \nomitted)); see also Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate, Ltd., No. 14-1128, 2014 WL 2726187, at *2 \n(7th Cir. June 16, 2014) (Posner, J.) (“It would be very nice to be able to ask federal judges for \nlegal advice . . . . But that would be advisory jurisdiction, which” is “inconsistent with Article \nIII’s limitation of federal jurisdiction to actual disputes, thus excluding jurisdiction over merely \npotential ones . . . .”). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 34\nother criminal defendants challenging traditional FISA, base his Article III complaint in \nthe fact that the FISC acts in secret and ex parte.  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, \n732 n.19 (FISCR 2002); In re Kevork, 634 F. Supp. 1002, 1013 (C.D. Cal. 1985), aff’d, \n788 F.2d 566 (9th Cir. 1986); United States v. Megahey, 553 F. Supp. 1180, 1196 \n(E.D.N.Y. 1982), aff’d sub nom., United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 73–74 (2d Cir. \n1984); see also In re Application of the U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \n§ 2703(d), 830 F. Supp. 2d 114, 144 (E.D. Va. 2011).  Rather, Mr. Muhtorov’s Article III \nargument is that the FAA asks judges to judge absent a constitutionally required “case or \ncontroversy” in which to do so.  See Application of President’s Comm’n on Organized \nCrime, 763 F.2d at 1203. \n  When the government addresses Mr. Muhtorov’s actual Article III challenge, its \narguments are unpersuasive.  The government contends that FISC opinions approving or \ndisapproving of targeting and minimization procedures under the FAA are “no more \nadvisory” than other kinds of Fourth Amendment assessments that “courts regularly \nundertake.”  Doc. 559 at 79.13  But while “[a]nalyzing the reasonableness of electronic \nsurveillance . . . is a traditional judicial function,” Doc. 559 at 79, an Article III court \ncannot conduct such an analysis absent a “case or controversy.”  The government likens \nthe FISC’s FAA review to judicial rulings on traditional search warrants or wiretap \n                                                           \n13 The government’s suggestion that the FISC’s FAA review is not advisory because its orders \n“ha[ve] legal effect,” Doc. 559 at 77, is misguided. All statutes and regulations have “legal \neffect.” This does not mean that an Article III court can adjudicate their constitutionality in the \nabsence of any case or controversy.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 34\napplications, see Doc. 559 at 77, even as it concedes that “warrant or wiretap applications \nfor law enforcement purposes typically involve a more fact-specific form of review” than \nthat required by the FAA, Doc. 559 at 80.14  But the concession that traditional warrant \nassessments are “more” fact-specific minimizes the crucial difference—where warrant \nand wiretap applications almost invariably involve particular targets or premises and \nunique, articulable facts, the FISC’s FAA review involves none. \nFinally, the government mistakes that when courts engage in Fourth Amendment \nreview of warrant and wiretap schemes they always do so consistent with Article III. Yet \nthat overlooks, again, what makes a “case or controversy.”  Consistent with Article III, \ncourts may engage in a Fourth Amendment review of such schemes only when presented \nwith a concrete legal question at the behest of an individual affected by them.  A court \nmay adjudicate the Fourth Amendment reasonableness of statutory schemes governing \ndomestic wiretaps for law-enforcement purposes or administrative warrants in the public-\nhealth context.  See Doc. 559 at 79–80 (citing United States v. Tortorello, 480 F.2d 764, \n772–73 (2d Cir. 1973); Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 537–38 (1967)).  And \ncourts may also assess surveillance schemes for constitutional reasonableness. See, e.g., \nBerger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967).  But there would have been no “case or \n                                                           \n14 The government provides no citation for its bare and circular assertion that these differences \nare “because the Fourth Amendment or Title III require[] more particularity in those contexts—\nnot because of anything in Article III,” Doc. 559 at 80. And, in fact, in advocating passage of \nFISA in 1978, the executive branch defended the constitutionality of the law against Article III \nobjections by pointing to precisely the type of specificity that is lacking under the FAA. See Doc. \n520 at 46–47. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 34\ncontroversy” in Tortorello without Arthur Tortorello, nor in Camara without Roland \nCamara, nor in Berger without Ralph Berger—nor, here, without Jamshid Muhtorov.  \nThe government is correct that a court could evaluate the government’s proposed \ntargeting and minimization procedures “as applied to specific, technical tools through \nwhich the government implements” the FAA. Doc. 559 at 79. But because the FAA asks \nthe FISC to make that assessment absent a concrete dispute, the statute violates Article \nIII. \nII.  THE GOOD FAITH EXCEPTION DOES NOT APPLY. \nThe good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply to FISA’s \nstatutory suppression remedy.  And even if it did, it would have no application here. \nIf the Court “determines that the surveillance was not lawfully authorized or \nconducted, it shall . . . suppress the evidence which was unlawfully obtained or derived” \nfrom such surveillance.  50 U.S.C. § 1806(g) (emphasis added).  “This ground for \nsuppression plainly includes constitutional challenges to FISA itself.”  David S. Kris & J. \nDouglas Wilson, 2 National Security Investigations and Prosecutions § 32:3 (2d ed. \n2012); see also id. § 32:3 & n.2 (“[The] judge reviewing [a] motion to suppress FISA \nevidence ‘is also free to review the constitutionality of the law itself.’” (quoting FISA H. \nRep. at 92–93)); ACLU Found. of S. Cal. v. Barr, 952 F.2d 457, 465 (D.C. Cir. 1991) \n(“The Constitution is law” to determine whether FISA surveillance was “‘lawfully \nauthorized and conducted.’”). If the Court finds that the government’s surveillance of Mr. \nMuhtorov’s communications under the FAA was unconstitutional, it must order \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 34\nsuppression under § 1806(g).  This is required by the statute, and “does not turn on the \njudicially fashioned exclusionary rule aimed at deterring violations of Fourth Amendment \nrights.”  United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 524 (1974).  The limits on the \njudicially created exclusionary rule do not apply to the statutory exclusionary rule. As \nwith Title III, the good-faith exception to the Fourth Amendment’s exclusionary rule \ndoes not apply.  United States v. Glover, 736 F.3d 509, 515–16 (D.C. Cir. 2013); United \nStates v. Rice, 478 F.3d 704, 711–14 (6th Cir. 2007) (“The language and legislative \nhistory of Title III strongly militate against engrafting the good-faith exception into Title \nIII warrants.”); id. at 713–14 (criticizing contrary holdings of the Eighth and Eleventh \nCircuits).15 \nEven if the good-faith exception applied to § 1806(g), it would not be properly \ninvoked here.  The government contends that suppression is unwarranted because it relied \nin good faith on “orders issued by neutral magistrates—the judges of the FISC,” Doc. 559 \nat 81 (citing United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984)), on a facially constitutional \nstatute, id. at 80–81 (citing Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340 (1987)), and on appellate \nprecedent from the FISA Court of Review, id. at 81 (citing Davis v. United States, 131 S. \nCt. 2419 (2011)).  These arguments are misplaced.  The good-faith exception announced \nin Leon does not apply because this case does not involve reliance on an individualized \nwarrant authorizing the search of particularly described communications or locations.  \n                                                           \n15 The Tenth Circuit has not yet had occasion to decide “whether the good-faith exception applies \nin the Title III context.”  United States v. Barajas, 710 F.3d 1102, 1110 (10th Cir. 2013). \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 34\nSee Leon, 468 U.S. at 920–21; United States v. Ning Wen, 477 F.3d 896, 897–98 (7th Cir. \n2006) (discussing reliance on individualized FISA warrants).  For FAA surveillance, the \nFISC approves only general procedures proposed by the government, and, on the basis of \nthose procedures alone, the government determines whom to monitor, when, and for how \nlong.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  No judge approves the target of the surveillance or makes \nan individualized assessment of probable cause.  Therefore, there is no warrant upon \nwhich the government can rely within the meaning of Leon. \nReliance on the statute does not justify application of the good-faith exception \neither.  To so hold would render the § 1806(g) statutory suppression remedy moot when \nthe government has violated the Fourth Amendment.  It makes no sense that reliance on \nthe terms of an unconstitutional statute functions to erase the suppression remedy \nexplicitly provided by that same statute for unconstitutional searches.  Further, the \ngovernment may have violated the statute itself during its surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov, \nwhich would trigger application of the § 1806(g) suppression remedy.  See Doc. 520 at \n38 (discussing “about searches”); id. at 39 (discussing “backdoor searches”); [Redacted], \n2011 WL 10945618, at *9 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011) (finding that government’s minimization \nprocedures contradict the FAA’s requirements).  Reasonable government officials \n“should have known that the statute was unconstitutional,” Krull, 480 U.S. at 355, given \nits manifest and multiple infirmities. See Doc. 520 at 20–47; supra Part I.  \nFinally, reliance on In re Directives—an inapposite opinion of the FISCR—does \nnot justify application of the good-faith exception under Davis.  Davis suspends operation \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 34\nof the exclusionary rule when the government conducts a search “in objectively \nreasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.” 131 S. Ct. at 2428–29.  As the \nEleventh Circuit has explained, “precedent on a given point must be unequivocal.” \nUnited States v. Davis, 598 F.3d 1259, 1266 (11th Cir. 2010), aff’d 131 S. Ct. 2419; \naccord United States v. Buford, 632 F.3d 264, 276 n.9 (6th Cir. 2011).  The sole appellate \nprecedent the government cites as justifying the surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov is In re \nDirectives, in which the Court of Review evaluated a distinct and now-expired statute, \nthe PAA, based on different criteria and different facts, including limitations on the \nsurveillance not provided here.  See supra Part I.A. In re Directives is not on point.  And \neven if it were, the government fails to explain how an opinion of a nonadversarial court \nthat conducts proceedings in secret and has, to the public’s knowledge, convened only \ntwice in its 36-year history constitutes binding appellate precedent within the meaning of \nDavis.  See United States v. Madden, 682 F.3d 920, 927 (10th Cir. 2012) (stating that \nDavis applies when there is “well-settled law of this court” (emphasis added)).  The \ngood-faith exception does not apply. \nIII.  MR. MUHTOROV IS ENTITLED TO DISCOVERY. \nThe government contends this Court’s in camera, ex parte review of materials at \nissue in Mr. Muhtorov’s motion satisfies the statute and the Due Process Clause.  Doc. \n559 at 87–88.  Though the statute empowers the Court to conduct such a review, Mr. \nMuhtorov has provided the basis for this Court to order disclosure to his counsel, subject \nto appropriate protective orders.  Doc. 520 at 47–66.  Such disclosure is “necessary” \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 34\nunder the statute, 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), and the Court should reject the government’s \ncramped reading of that term.  See Cellular Telecomms. & Internet Ass’n v. FCC, 330 \nF.3d 502, 509–10 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (explaining that “necessary” has a flexible meaning \ninformed by context and often “mean[s] less than absolutely essential” (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)).  The legislative history clarifies that Congress fully intended there to be \ndisclosure and adversary proceedings in at least some FISA cases because “[t]he \ndefendant’s constitutional guarantee of a fair trial could be seriously undercut if he is \ndenied the materials needed to present a proper defense.  The committee believes that a \njust, effective balance has been struck in this section.”  S. Rep. No. 95-701, at 59 (1978), \nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3973, 4028.  Congress contemplated that “[c]ases may \narise, of course, where the court believes that disclosure is necessary.”  Id. at 65, \nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4034.  The government’s reading of the statute would \nforeclose any possibility of such cases arising and frustrate Congress’s intent. \nAs support for the claim that no disclosure is warranted here, the government cites \ncases addressing run-of-the-mill surveillance under individualized FISA surveillance \norders.  Doc. 559 at 89–91.  But characterizing Mr. Muhtorov’s arguments as mere \nrehashing of these prior cases trivializes the novel complexities.  Mr. Muhtorov \nchallenges the constitutionality of the more complex surveillance program operated under \nthe FAA.  No appeals court has addressed the constitutionality of this statute, nor of \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 34\ncollection of particular U.S. persons’ communications under it.16  See supra Parts I–II. \nDetermining the constitutionality of FAA surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov requires \nassessment not only of the statutory scheme, but also of the government’s targeting and \nminimization procedures, of its application of those procedures, and of complicated, \nfactually contingent questions such as whether and precisely how Mr. Muhtorov’s \ncommunications were obtained via “about” or “backdoor” searches.  Addressing the \nconstitutionality of the surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications requires insight \ninto the surveillance, which is not possible without access to the underlying records.  \nSurveillance and searches under FISA and the FAA present especially acute \ndifficulties to defendants seeking to vindicate their Fourth Amendment rights under \nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).  But that does not mean that the necessity of \nthe Franks procedure in FISA cases is diminished in any way:  “Franks serves as an \nindispensable check on potential abuses of the warrant process, and means must be found \nto keep Franks from becoming a dead letter in the FISA context.”  United States v. \nDaoud, No. 14-1284, 2014 WL 2696734, at *7 (7th Cir. June 16, 2014) (Rovner, J., \nconcurring).  The government concedes that Franks applies to FAA surveillance.  Doc. \n559 at 95.  And although it contends that the Court’s in camera, ex parte review of \nclassified FAA materials identifies and adjudicate any Fourth Amendment violations, see \nid. at 91, this non-adversarial process provides only a pale shadow of the protection \n                                                           \n16 The government asserts that the FISA Court of Review’s decision in In re Directives settles \nthese issues, but as explained above, that case is not on point. See supra Parts I.A, II. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 34\ncontemplated by Franks.  As Judge Rovner explained, “although a court may be able to \ndiscover inconsistencies in the FISA materials, its ability to discover false statements and \nomissions is necessarily limited, as it has only the government’s version of the facts. . . . \n[A] court cannot conduct more than a limited Franks review on its own.”  Daoud, 2014 \nWL 2696734, at *15–16. \n  Here, however, the Court need not be hobbled by such limited process.  Contrary \nto the government’s suggestion, Mr. Muhtorov does not seek a Franks hearing solely \n“based on evidence of misrepresentations in some other case.”  Doc. 559 at 91 n.53. \nRather, unlike in Daoud, 2014 WL 2696734, at *4, 6, he has identified evidence, in a \ndeclassified FISC opinion, that the FISC’s approval of programmatic FAA surveillance \nwhen his communications were collected under that authority was tainted by government \nmisrepresentations of fact. Doc. 520 at 53–54, 56–57 (citing [Redacted], 2011 WL \n10945618 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011)).  This meets the threshold set by Franks, 438 U.S. at \n171–72, and requires disclosure of the government’s application(s) to the FISC (subject \nto appropriate protective orders) and an adversarial hearing on Mr. Muhtorov’s motion.17 \n   \n   \n                                                           \n17 Moreover, Daoud was argued and decided as a case raising issues under traditional FISA \nprinciples, and the opinion does not purport to address discovery and disclosure issues under the \nFAA. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 602   Filed 07/03/14   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 34\nDated: July 3, 2014       Respectfully submitted, \n \nVIRGINIA L.

Tranakos, 911 F.2d \nthe date back to September 1, 2016. The filing of the  1422, 1429 (10th Cir. 1990). As a result, I would weigh \nThird Superseding Indictment by the government in May  Barker’s  third  assertion-of-the-right  factor  heavily  in \n2016 “mandated” an additional trial delay. Finally, as  Jumaev’s favor. \ndiscussed  above,  belated  discovery  following  the    \ncourt-imposed discovery cut-off resulted in an additional   \nyear’s delay in trial. Unlike Batie, Jumaev did not seek   \ncontinuances. He waited on the government to fulfill its \nresponsibilities,  diligently  and  persistently  filing \ndiscovery motions that were not met in a timely fashion. \nIV \nIf this is the conduct I am weighing, the balance easily \ncomes down on Jumaev’s side of the scale. \n  \nFor the reasons described herein and in the Muhtorov \nThe majority also ignores that, after severance, Jumaev \ndissent, I weigh all four Barker factors heavily in favor of \nwas required to proceed to trial first, before Muhtorov. \nJumaev and conclude his conviction must be vacated for \n19 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Jumaev, 20 F.4th 518 (2021)   \n \n \nwant of a speedy trial. Any other result would “not [be]  All Citations \nconsistent with the interests of defendants, society, or the \nConstitution.” Barker, 407 U.S. at 528, 92 S.Ct. 2182.  20 F.4th 518 \n    \nFootnotes \n \n1  Muhtorov was also convicted on a third count not brought against Jumaev. See United States v. Muhtorov, No. \n  18-1366, 20 F.4th 558, 580-81, 581-82, 637-38 (10th Cir. Dec. 8, 2021). \n \n2  To the extent Jumaev presented a facial challenge, it was resolved by the district court’s rejection of Muhtorov’s \n  as-applied and facial challenges. See App’x Vol. III at 119; see also Muhtorov, 20 F.4th at 591 n.11 (noting that \nbecause Muhtorov’s as-applied Section 702 challenge fails, his “facial challenge necessarily fails” as well). \n \n3  Counts 3 and 4 pertained solely to Muhtorov. \n \n \n4  Jumaev was released into the custody of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The government seeks to \n  remove Jumaev from the United States, and on January 12, 2021, the Board of Immigration Appeals entered a final \norder of removal. Jumaev, though, has challenged that order in a separate appeal. See Jumaev v. Garland, No. \n21-9513 (10th Cir. filed Feb. 2, 2021). On May 14, 2021, this court issued a stay of removal. Order, Jumaev, No. \n21-9513 (May 14, 2021). Jumaev’s immigration appeal otherwise remains pending. \n \n5  The dissent’s primary criticisms of our speedy trial analysis here are the same as those lodged against our speedy \n  trial analysis in Muhtorov. See Dissent at 553 (dissenting “[f]or the reasons stated in” the Muhtorov dissent and \n“incorporat[ing] that dissent in its entirety”). As we detail in Muhtorov, we respectfully disagree with those \nobjections. \n \n6  As noted above, toward the end of 2017, the district judge alerted counsel that he unexpectedly needed to undergo \n  medical treatment, and, as a result, Jumaev’s trial was moved from January 2018 to March 2018. App’x Vol. IV at \n832, Vol. XIII at 1080. For the same reason, Muhtorov’s trial was similarly moved, from March 2018 to May 2018. \nMuhtorov, 20 F.4th at 643-44. Because the government completed discovery in Muhtorov’s case in January \n2018—four months before Muhtorov’s trial occurred—we consider the delay caused by the district judge’s medical \ntreatment in the course of assessing Muhtorov’s speedy trial claim. See id. at 20 F.4th at 643-44, 648-49. But with \nrespect to Jumaev, discovery was completed later than in Muhtorov’s case and trial occurred sooner—just one \nmonth after the government finished its discovery productions. As a result, delays due to discovery productions \neclipsed the delay due to the district judge’s medical treatment, eliminating the need to address the district judge’s \nmedical situation as part of our analysis of Jumaev’s claim. \nThe dissent’s approach differs slightly from ours here. It reasons that “[b]ut for ... government-caused delay, the trial \nwould have begun in March 2017,” and “therefore [the dissent] would attribute the entire additional year’s delay \n20 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Jumaev, 20 F.4th 518 (2021)   \n \n \n[from March 2017 to March 2018] to the government,” including the “additional two months until March 2018 due \nto the district court judge’s illness.” Dissent at 554 n.3. In our view, these different paths lead to the same \ndestination, for, like the dissent, we count the entire period from March 2017 to March 2018 as delay that the \ngovernment must justify. However, unlike the dissent, our basis for reaching this conclusion is that discovery was \nnot completed until February 2018, making an earlier trial impossible. The dissent’s analysis does not necessarily \nconflict with our own—indeed, in Muhtorov we do weigh the delay caused by the judge’s medical treatment against \nthe government, albeit not heavily. See 20 F.4th at 648-49. But in this case we do not, at the end of the day, reach \nthe issue of the judge’s illness. \n \n7  As we detail in section III, infra, Jumaev asserts that the government violated its discovery obligations in this case by \n  (1) failing to meet the September 1, 2016 discovery deadline; (2) bringing new charges against him late into the \nproceedings, which forced his defense team to revisit and reevaluate the discovery that had been produced up until \nthat point; and (3) delaying the disclosure of potential impeachment information concerning a witness, Sobirov, \nuntil the morning of that witness’s deposition. See Reply Br. at 27–28. Although Muhtorov does not also raise these \nclaims on appeal, they do not render Jumaev’s case dissimilar from Muhtorov’s for purposes of the second Barker \nfactor. Jumaev’s claim concerning the government’s failure to meet the discovery deadline is simply a recasting of \nJumaev and Muhtorov’s general complaints about the slow pace of discovery. Similarly, the late-filed charges \nincluded in the third superseding indictment were brought against Jumaev as well as Muhtorov, see App’x Vol. III at \n262–63, so any time lost due to that development affected them both, see Muhtorov, 20 F.4th at 649 (explaining \nthat “Muhtorov would not have ‘faced trial ... earlier than he did but for’ the ... filing and dismissing of the third \nsuperseding indictment” “[g]iven that the discovery process happened before, during, and after [that] event[ ]” (first \nomission in original) (quoting Doggett, 505 U.S. at 657, 112 S.Ct. 2686)). Finally, while the late disclosure of potential \nimpeachment information about Sobirov is an issue unique to Jumaev, that late disclosure had no impact on \nJumaev’s trial date, and therefore is not relevant to our assessment of the second Barker factor. \n \n8  In keeping with this acknowledgment, Jumaev has not appealed the denial of the Section 702 suppression motion. \n  Muhtorov, though, has appealed that ruling, and we address it in the opinion dedicated to his claims. See Muhtorov, \n20 F.4th at 583-618. \n \n9  The dissent maintains that “Jumaev’s decision to join Muhtorov’s ... suppression motion in 2014 did not evidence \n  Jumaev’s lack of eagerness to go to trial” because “Jumaev and Muhtorov remained as co-defendants in a single trial \nuntil the November 2016 severance,” and therefore, “regardless of whether he joined the motion, [Jumaev] could \nnot progress toward trial until the motion was decided in November 2015.” Dissent at 556 n.7. The dissent never \nexplains, however, why Jumaev could not have asked for a severance once it became clear that Muhtorov’s case \nwould require resolution of the complicated issues surrounding Section 702 surveillance. Indeed, when Muhtorov \nasked for a severance, it was granted. See Muhtorov, 2016 WL 11612426, at *1–2. \n \n10  In addition to the foregoing analysis, we note that (1) Jumaev did not object to a number of continuances requested \n  by the government under the Speedy Trial Act (“STA”), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161–3174, see App’x Vol. I at 489, 491, 529, \n542, 548, and (2) Jumaev himself requested a nine-month continuance on March 13, 2017, the date his trial was \ninitially scheduled to occur, see id. Vol. XVIII at 86, 90. We do not, however, count these continuances against \nJumaev. Just as in Muhtorov, once Jumaev committed himself to litigating the Section 702 issue his “failure to object \n21 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Jumaev, 20 F.4th 518 (2021)   \n \n \n[to STA continuances] sooner was understandable in light of [the] pending motions to suppress.” 20 F.4th at 652 \n(explaining that “[i]t may have been pointless for [Muhtorov] to object to the STA continuances given the pending \nsuppression motions”). As for Jumaev’s own motion for a continuance, he filed it only after his first speedy trial \nmotion was denied, and he maintained that the continuance was necessary, in part, due to the government’s \nongoing document productions. See App’x Vol. XVIII at 85–86. Given that the government did continue to produce \ndiscovery well after March 13, 2017, we agree that Jumaev’s request for a continuance did not necessarily run \ncounter to a desire to proceed to trial quickly. \n \n11  The dissent also claims that our analysis, at the very least, “penalize[s] Jumaev by faulting him for not augmenting \n  the motions filed by his counsel with pro se motions.” Dissent at 556. This, again, is an inaccurate representation of \nour reasoning. We do not punish Jumaev for not filing pro se motions. We simply adjudge that the two delinquent \nmotions Jumaev did file were insufficient to tilt the third Barker factor in his favor. \n \n12  In expressing this opinion, the dissent says that “Jumaev did not seek continuances.” Dissent at 557. That is not true. \n  As mentioned above, Jumaev did, in fact, ask for a nine-month continuance after his first speedy trial motion was \ndenied. See supra note 10. But because we do not count this request against Jumaev, see id., this discrepancy is \nimmaterial. \n \n13  Although Jumaev references the principle that incarceration is more oppressive when it occurs in “local jails” that \n  “lack ... rehabilitation programs and visiting privileges,” Muhtorov, 20 F.4th at 656, he does not specifically claim \nthat he spent time in such a place, and the record discloses that he was incarcerated at a federal facility—the \nEnglewood Federal Detention Center—from March 30, 2012 through his release in 2018, see, e.g., App’x Vol. VI at \n695. \n \n14  In his opening brief, Jumaev appeared to raise, in addition to the argument we consider here, an argument that the \n  government failed to timely fulfill its obligations under Brady v. Maryland. See Aplt. Br. at 59 (“The court erred in \ndeclining to impose sufficient sanctions for the government’s repeated violations of its Brady obligations and the \ncourt’s discovery orders.”). In his reply brief, however, Jumaev clarifies that he does not “argu[e] a constitutional \nviolation based on the late disclosure of Brady material.” Reply Br. at 27. Rather, he argues only “that the district \ncourt  erred  by  declining  to  impose  sufficient  sanctions  for  discovery  violations.”  Id.  Because  Jumaev  has \n“intentionally relinquished” his Brady argument, we do not address it. Folks v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 784 \nF.3d 730, 737 (10th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc., 634 F.3d \n1123, 1127 (10th Cir. 2011)); see also United States v. Augustine, 742 F.3d 1258, 1264 n.1 (10th Cir. 2014) (declining \nto consider arguments that were “abandoned ... in [the] reply brief”). \n \n15  Jumaev moved for this continuance because he needed more time to review discovery produced by the September \n  1, 2016 deadline. See supra notes 10, 12. He also did so, though, because (among other reasons) the government \nproduced  discovery  after  the  September  1,  2016  deadline.  See  id.  Hence,  we  agree  with  Jumaev  that  the \ncontinuance was, in part, a means of addressing the government’s post-deadline discovery production. \n22 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Jumaev, 20 F.4th 518 (2021)   \n \n \n \n16  The government contends that Jumaev “has not shown any discovery order ... violations,” Aple. Br. at 19, a claim \n  that appears to be premised on the fact that, although the government was sanctioned for its discovery conduct, it \nwas not sanctioned for violating an order of the district court pertaining to discovery. While the government’s \nassertion is partially correct as a factual matter, the government offers a distinction without a difference. The \ngovernment is subject to discovery obligations in a criminal case regardless of whether the district court issues \ndiscovery  orders,  and  the  district  court’s  authority  to  order  sanctions  for  late  compliance  with  discovery \nobligations—as well as our review of such an order—is unaffected by the source of the discovery obligation that was \nviolated. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2) (authorizing a district court to issue sanctions for violations of the discovery \nobligations imposed by Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including those obligations created by a \ndistrict court order issued pursuant to Rule 16(d)(1)); United States v. Burke, 571 F.3d 1048, 1054 (10th Cir. 2009) \n(indicating that district courts have authority under Rule 16 to remedy belated disclosures that violate Brady rather \nthan Rule 16 itself); United States v. Gonzales, 164 F.3d 1285, 1291–92 (10th Cir. 1999) (observing that “[e]ven \nwhere Rule 16 is inapplicable, the courts have discretion to exclude evidence as a sanction for violation of a \ndiscovery order,” id. at 1291, and employing the same legal standard used in Rule 16 cases). \n \n17  This observation from Muhtorov concerns the overall pace of discovery, and thus applies here only to the \n  government’s failure to complete discovery by the September 1, 2016 deadline. But we similarly find no evidence of \nbad  faith  concerning  the  filing  of  the  third  superseding  indictment  and  the  delayed  disclosure  of  potential \nimpeachment information about Sobirov. Jumaev points to only one possible instance of bad faith related to either \nof these events: that in response to Jumaev’s motion to have Sobirov—an immigrant who had left the country after \nserving as a confidential human source for the government—paroled into the United States to testify at Jumaev’s \ntrial, the government asserted that the motion should be denied “because there was no way of knowing whether \n[Sobirov] would leave willingly after the trial.” App’x Vol. VII at 405; see Aplt. Br. at 62, 64. The district court \ndetermined that “[t]his representation by the government was not forthright and bordered on deceitful,” given that \nthe government “had previously granted Mr. Sobirov deferred action and Significant Public Benefit Parole so that he \ncould remain in the U.S.” App’x Vol. VII at 405. \nWhile the government’s misrepresentation is troubling, in this appeal Jumaev does not take issue with the fact that \nSobirov was unavailable to testify at Jumaev’s trial. And critically, Jumaev never explains how the government’s lack \nof candor in opposing his motion to have Sobirov paroled into the United States demonstrates that the timing of its \ndisclosure  of  potential  impeachment  information  about  Sobirov  was  the  product  of  bad  faith.  Indeed,  any \nconnection between the motion and the delayed disclosure is tenuous at best given that, a month before Sobirov’s \ndeposition, the government dropped its opposition to permitting Sobirov to enter the United States to testify. See \nid. at 332. Jumaev thus has not established that the discovery violations at issue were the product of bad faith. \n \n18  We have also indicated that, absent prejudice, a district court may suppress evidence that did not comply with \n  discovery orders when doing so is necessary “to maintain the integrity and schedule of the court.” Wicker, 848 F.2d \nat 1061. Jumaev does not argue that such circumstances were presented in this case. \n \n19  Prohibiting the use of such evidence in support of the other counts is what gave this part of the district court’s order \n  its teeth, as by the time the court was ready to rule on this discovery issue, the government had voluntarily \ndismissed counts 5 and 6. See App’x Vol. XVIII at 83. \n23 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Jumaev, 20 F.4th 518 (2021)   \n \n \n \n20  Unpublished cases cited in this opinion are not binding precedent, but we consider them for their persuasive value. \n  See Fed. R. App. P. 32.1(a); 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A), (C). \n \n21  There are also statutory limits on a magistrate judge’s authority. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(a); see also Krueger, 809 F.3d at \n  1117–18 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the judgment) (emphasizing the importance of these statutory limits). \n \n22  We assess whether a Rule 41 violation justifies suppression using the analytical framework this court adopted in \n  United States v. Pennington, 635 F.2d 1387 (10th Cir. 1980). “Under this framework, we begin by considering \nwhether Rule 41 was in fact violated.” Krueger, 809 F.3d at 1113. “If so, we typically proceed by determining \nwhether that specific Rule 41 violation rises to the level of a Fourth Amendment violation.” Id. “If we determine that \nthe Rule 41 violation is not of constitutional import, we then consider whether the defendant can establish that, as a \nresult of the Rule violation, ‘(1) there was “prejudice” in the sense that the search might not have occurred or would \nnot have been so abrasive if the Rule had been followed, or (2) there is evidence of intentional and deliberate \ndisregard of a provision in the Rule.’ ” Id. at 1114 (quoting Pennington, 635 F.2d at 1390). \nBecause we conclude that Rule 41 was not violated, we resolve this case at the first step of the Pennington analysis. \nFurther, for the same reason, we do not address the government’s alternative argument that the good faith \nexception to the exclusionary rule applies. \n \n23  Rule 41 also lays down requirements as to what must be in a warrant. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e)(2) (“Contents of the \n  Warrant”). Again, information about venue is not among those requirements. See id. \n \n1  Jumaev also contends that the district court abused its discretion by declining to severely sanction the government \n  for its discovery violations and that the extraterritorial search warrants issued in his case violated Rule 41. (Op. at \n528.) Because I would vacate his conviction on the basis of a speedy trial violation, I do not address these \ncontentions. \n \n2  For Jumaev, my colleagues determine that “the first, second, and fourth Barker factors carry essentially the same \n  weights here that they carry in Muhtorov.” (Op. at 545.) In other words, for them, the length of the delay weighs \nheavily in favor of a constitutional violation and the prejudice arising from this delay weighs in Jumaev’s favor, but \nthe decisive second factor—the reason for the delay—weighs against him. (Op. at 545-46.) As I did in Muhtorov, I \nwould also weigh the prejudice factor more heavily in Jumaev’s favor. In evaluating this factor we must “recognize \nthat excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for \nthat matter, identify.” Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 655, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992). This \npresumption of prejudice “cannot alone carry a Sixth Amendment claim without regard to the other Barker criteria, \n[but] it is part of the mix of relevant facts, and its importance increases with the length of delay.” Id. at 656, 112 \nS.Ct. 2686 (citation omitted and emphasis added). \n24 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Jumaev, 20 F.4th 518 (2021)   \n \n \n \n3  Although the initial continuance granted after the district court denied Jumaev’s requested remedy of dismissal was \n  for ten months until January 2018, the trial was delayed for an additional two months until March 2018 due to the \ndistrict court judge’s illness. But for the government-caused delay, the trial would have begun in March 2017, \ntherefore I would attribute the entire additional year’s delay to the government. See United States v. Carini, 562 \nF.2d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 1977) (illnesses of judges are institutional delays properly chargeable to the government). As \nthe record makes clear, replacement of the trial judge during his treatment would have delayed the trial longer as \nthe available replacement would have required time to become familiar with the case. \n \n4  Jumaev’s March 2017 motion was filed only after his speedy trial motion was denied, a decision which the district \n  court recognized forced his counsel to seek a continuance or go to trial and provide ineffective assistance. For \nJumaev,  the  March  2017  speedy  trial  motion  was  filed  to  avoid  the  additional  delay  necessitated  by  the \ngovernment’s late production of discovery, including disclosure of trial exhibits on the eve of trial; it was not filed \n“after the delay has already occurred.” (Op. at 539 (quotation omitted).) The record is clear that absent the \ngovernment’s  late  disclosures,  Jumaev  was  ready  to  proceed  to  trial  in  March  2017.  Late  production  of \nconstitutionally required discovery by the government continued until the eve of the March 2018 trial. (See Op. at \n534 n.6.) Counsel for Jumaev argued below that these late disclosures included unclassified evidence long in the \npossession of the government that was not required to be analyzed under CIPA. \n \n5  Appellate review of Muhtorov’s pro se motions is problematic because the motions were, permissibly, not accepted \n  by the district court. See generally United States v. Dunbar, 718 F.3d 1268, 1278 (10th Cir. 2013) (“Defendant ha[s] \nno right to submit motions other than through his attorney.”); United States v. Bennett, 539 F.2d 45, 49 (10th Cir. \n1976) (“[P]ermission for [hybrid representation is] recognized as being discretionary with the trial court.”). \n \n6  Both Muhtorov and Jumaev filed two counseled motions for a speedy trial violation; the sole difference in the \n  number of speedy trial motions are the two pro se motions filed by Muhtorov. I conclude that both Muhtorov and \nJumaev sufficiently asserted their right to a speedy trial, and disagree that this factor weighs against Jumaev. \n \n7  My colleagues in the majority fault Jumaev for joining Muhtorov’s motion to suppress § 702-derived evidence. They \n  assert that Jumaev “knew that his chances of prevailing on the motion were close to zero,” in part because the \n“government informed Jumaev two months before he joined Muhtorov’s motion that he was not an ‘aggrieved \nperson’  as  to  the  Section  702  acquisitions  at  issue,”  and  therefore,  Jumaev’s  decision  to  join  the  motion \ndemonstrates that he was not actually eager to go to trial. (Op. at 538.) Problems abound with this analysis. First, \nthe government’s assertion that Jumaev was not an “aggrieved person” entitled to notice is an unsettled question of \nstatutory interpretation that, although not presently contested in this appeal, was open to good faith challenge by \nJumaev below. Second, contrary to the majority’s assertion, the belated government assurances that Jumaev was \nnot an “aggrieved person” were far from unequivocal, requiring several defense motions to gain a clear articulation \nof the government’s position. Third, in accordance with the government’s decision to try them jointly, Jumaev and \nMuhtorov remained as co-defendants in a single trial until the November 2016 severance. Therefore, Jumaev’s \ndecision to join Muhtorov’s second suppression motion in 2014 did not evidence Jumaev’s lack of eagerness to go to \ntrial because, regardless of whether he joined the motion, he could not progress toward trial until the motion was \ndecided in November 2015, which was more than a year before severance. Finally, as recognized by the district \n25 \n \n\n \n \nUnited States v. Jumaev, 20 F.4th 518 (2021)   \n \n \ncourt, the government’s interpretation that Jumaev was not an “aggrieved person” under the statute does not \nresolve the constitutional derivative evidence inquiry or his facial challenge to the constitutionality of § 702 \nsurveillance. \nThe majority asserts that “the district court corroborated this claim [that Jumaev’s chances of success on the motion \nto suppress were close to zero] ... at a hearing that took place when the joint motion was pending.” (Op. at 538.) In \ndoing so, the majority once again ignores context—at this June 2015 hearing, the district court told the parties \n“what he was going to do, and what it means” in regard to the defendants’ motion to suppress § 702 evidence. Far \nfrom evidencing a foregone conclusion that Jumaev’s “chances of prevailing on the motion were close to zero,” id., \nit instead was a preliminary ruling on that very question. Given that the evidence used against Jumaev was derived \nfrom § 702 surveillance, albeit one step removed from that of Muhtorov, Jumaev’s decision to join in Muhtorov’s \nmotion to suppress evidence derived from § 702 surveillance was far from a bad faith attempt to delay the trial. To \nthe extent that additional delay resulted from this decision, which it did not given that the cases were not severed \nuntil a year after the motion to suppress was decided, it should not be weighed heavily against Jumaev. \nMy colleagues contend that Jumaev acknowledges that “the case against [him] had virtually nothing to do with \nFISA,” cherry picking this purported admission from his reply brief. (Op. at 538 (citing Reply Br. at 13).) To the \ncontrary, in his reply Jumaev was pointing out the contradiction in the government’s simultaneous assertion that \nFISA and CIPA did not apply to him and its insistence that FISA and CIPA still limited its ability to comply with its \ndiscovery obligations. My colleagues further question my failure to explain why Jumaev could not have moved for \nseverance earlier. (Op. at 538 n.9.) The more appropriate question is how he was to assess this decision without \nnotice of the involvement of § 702 evidence in the case against him for more than 23 months, or any meaningful \ndiscovery until September 2016. His inability to evaluate this decision was caused by the government’s obfuscation \nof the source of its evidence against him until after October 2013. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n26 \n ",

JAMSHID MUHTOROV, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n  \n \nDEFENDANT MUHTOROV’S MOTION FOR ORDER REQUIRING \nGOVERNMENT TO DISCLOSE OR PROVIDE HIS COUNSEL ACCESS TO ITS \nCLASSIFIED PLEADINGS AND OBJECTION TO EX PARTE PROCEEDINGS \n \n \n“In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, \nthe great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to \ncontrol the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.” \nThe Federalist No. 51 (James Madison) \n  This Court has the power to control the government’s due process-killing \nobsession with secrecy and security by ordering disclosure to the defense of the \nclassified material the government has hidden; specifically that which was \nredacted from its response filed May 5, 2014, Doc. 559, and which was included \nin its classified memorandum filed May 22, 2014, Doc. 569. \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 21\n  Jamshid Muhtorov, asks the Court to exercise this power to order \ndisclosure to the defense subject to appropriate protections. He does so because \nthe statute, 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), and Due Process require it.  \n  50 U.S.C. § 1806(f) \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(f) says that when a motion to suppress is filed under \nsubsection (e); or a motion is made to discover “applications or orders or other \nmaterials relating to electronic surveillance;” or a motion is made “to discover, \nobtain, or suppress evidence or information obtained or derived from electronic \nsurveillance under this chapter;” and the Attorney General files an affidavit \nalleging that disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm the national security, \nthe district court must – in camera and ex parte – “review the application, order, \nand such other materials relating to the surveillance as may be necessary to \ndetermine whether the surveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully \nauthorized and conducted.” \n § 1806(f) also says that “[i]n making this determination, the court may \ndisclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security procedures and \nprotective orders, portions of the application, order, or other materials relating to \nthe surveillance,” but should do so “only where such disclosure is necessary to \nmake an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.”  \nMr. Muhtorov asks that the Court make a finding, following its review of his \nmotion to suppress, the government’s responses (secret and not secret), and his \nreply (due July 3, 2014), that disclosure to the defense is necessary to make an \naccurate determination of the legality of the surveillance. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 21\nDue process \n50 U.S.C. § 1825(g) also permits disclosure if a district court's ex parte, in \ncamera review discloses that due process requires discovery or disclosure. While \nthe question “is not how to optimize the legal review of the surveillance and \nsearch,” if the district judge concludes “disclosure is ‘necessary’ in order to make \nthat determination,” it should be ordered. U.S. v. Mubayyid, 521 F.Supp.2d 125, \n130 (D.Mass.2007). \nTiming of disclosures \nMr. Muhtorov asks that the disclosures he seeks be made before the \nCourt conducts a hearing on the legal issues raised in his Motion to Suppress \n(Doc. 520); and there be an evidentiary hearing on that motion at which the \ndefendant and his counsel are present.  \nAlternative requests \nIf disclosure is not ordered, without waiving his motion for disclosure or his \nrequest for a full due process hearing, Mr. Muhtorov moves to strike the \nClassified Memorandum in its entirety, so whatever its hidden contents are, they \nmay not be considered by the Court in deciding the legal issues raised in the \nMotion to Suppress.   \nAgain, without waiving the requests made here, if the Court, ex parte or \notherwise, determines that the surveillance was illegal, Mr. Muhtorov moves it \nconduct a “taint hearing,” at which the Court would decide whether evidence the \ngovernment proposes to introduce “has been come at by exploitation of the \nillegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the \n  3 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 21\nprimary taint.”  Alderman v. United States 394 U.S. 165, 180-181, 89 S.Ct. 961, \n971 (1969). He asks that he and his attorneys be present at this hearing. As the \nAlderman Court observed, “the task (of determining taint) is too complex, and the \nmargin of error too great, to rely wholly on the in camera judgment of the trial \ncourt to identify those records which might have contributed to the Government's \ncase.” Id., 394 U.S. 182, 89 S.Ct. 971. \nProcedural Background \n  The government asks this Court to decide Mr. Muhtorov’s Motion to \nSuppress in secret, without disclosing the facts and basis that form its opposition.  \nThis request comes at the end of a long history – highlighted by recent discovery \n– demonstrating the government operates under a veil of secrecy regarding \nwiretapping and surveillance to gather “foreign intelligence.” \nIn 1952 President Harry Truman, in a secret letter, established the \nNational Security Agency.  1952 was also the year Joseph McCarthy assumed \nchairmanship of the Senate Committee on Government Operations and its \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The existence of the NSA remained \nsecret until the 1970s when a Senate Select Committee report disclosed that it \nhad been keeping a watch list of people involved in civil rights and anti-war \ndemonstrations.1  \n  The report was by the Church Committee, charged with investigating \ndomestic spying by the U.S. intelligence community. Senator Frank Church, its \nchairman, warned against the “tremendous potential for abuse” should the NSA \n                                                 \n1 S.Rep.No. 94-755, bk.III, at 735. (1976). \n  4 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 21\n“turn its awesome technology against domestic communications.”2  Senator \nChurch also said: \nI don’t want to see this country go across the bridge. I know the capacity \nthat is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that \nthis agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within \nthe law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that \nabyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.3 \n \nThe revelations of the Church Committee led to the passage of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, in 1978. Pub. L. No. 95-511, 92 \nStat. 1783 (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq. (2006)). 4 The first \nstatute enacted to regulate the use of electronic surveillance within the United \nStates for foreign intelligence, United States v. Megahey, 553 F.Supp. 1180, \n1184 (D.C.N.Y., 1982), FISA’s “principal purpose  . . . was to prohibit the \ngovernment from monitoring Americans’ electronic communications without a \n                                                 \n2 Intelligence Activities—The National Security and Fourth Amendment Rights, \n94th Cong. (1975) (statement of Se. Church, Chairman, Select Committee to \nStudy Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities). \n3 James A. Bamford, The Puzzle Palace, 379 (1983 ed.) \n4 See, e.g., Warrantless Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance, J. Hearings \nBefore the Subcomm. on Administrative Practice and Procedure and the \nSubcomm. on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary and \nthe Subcomm. on Surveillance of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, \n93rd Cong. part I(a), part I(b) & part II(a), part II(b), part II(c). (April 3, 8, 1974 & \nMay 8, 9, 10, and 23, 1974). The United States Supreme Court also reviewed \nsome of those abuses and declared that warrantless wiretaps of domestic groups \nfor national security reasons violated the Fourth Amendment.  United States v. \nUnited States District Court (Keith), 407 U.S. 297 (1972) \n  5 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 21\njudicially granted warrant.”  National Security and Double Government, 5 Harvard \nNational Security Journal at 77 (2014), see note 435. \n FISA was later amended, including in 1994 by the Patriot Act and by the \n2008 FISA Amendments Act. Between these dates, and in reaction to the attacks \nof September 11, 2001, then-President George W. Bush authorized the NSA – \nby secret order effective October 4, 2001 – to significantly broaden data \ncollection, a process that continued through 2004, when Attorney General \nAshcroft refused to reauthorize it. Id. at 78. Four months later, in an ex parte \nproceeding, the chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or \nFISC, entered an order permitting bulk collection of internet data without a \nwarrant. Id. at 78-79.  \nIn 2008 Congress passed the FISA Amendments Acts (FAA), partly in \nresponse to court rulings the secret program was unconstitutional. See, e.g., \nACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d 754 (E.D. Mich. 2006), rev’d at 493 F.3d 644 (6th \nCir. 2007). The FAA allowed the government to secretly eavesdrop on millions of \nAmericans – exactly what the Church Committee sought to prevent with the \nenactment of the original FISA legislation. \n  Since the passage of the FAA in 2008, the government has conducted its \nsecret surveillance with few checks or balances.  “[N]either Congress nor the \npublic had any knowledge that surveillance of this magnitude was permitted or \nwhether any checks were working,” as Senator Chris Coons put it. “The problem \n  6 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 21\nis: we here in the Senate and the citizens we represent don’t know how well any \nof these safeguards actually work.”5 \n  Recent revelations demonstrate that top executive branch officials have \nmade false statements and misrepresented information to the United States \nSenate and Supreme Court.  Opinions by FISC judges clarify that \nmisrepresentations have been made by the government to the FISC, as well.6  \n  As the public, Congress, and other officials learned of the widespread \ndomestic wiretapping and surveillance conducted by the government, the \nDepartment of Justice changed part of its secrecy policy.  One result was that \nover two years after he was indicted, Mr. Muhtorov was notified the government  \nintended to use against him evidence obtained under the FAA – or derived from \nevidence so obtained. The “notice” made by the government was less than a \npage in length and included no details or specifics. Doc. 457 (Oct. 25, 2013). \n                                                 \n5 Glenn Greenwalk, NSA taps in to use data of Facebook, Google and others, \nsecret files reveal, The Guardian, June 7, 2013, \nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data, cited in \nGlennon, Michael, National Security and Double Government, 5 HARV. NAT’L \nSEC. J. 1 (2014). \n6 In In re Production of Tangible Things From [REDACTED], Dkt. BR 08-13, \nMarch 2, 2009 FISC Judge Reggie B. Walton of the United States District Court \nfor the District of Columbia documented statutory violations of the NSA’s \nelectronic surveillance programs.  Judge Walton rejected the government’s \nexplanations for the violations and criticized its repeated misrepresentations and \nnon-compliance with FISC orders. In a declassified FISC opinion dated October \n3, 2011, Judge John D. Bates of the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia found the NSA’s surveillance under the FAA to be “deficient on \nstatutory and constitutional grounds,” particularly with respect to the mas \ncollection of emails of American citizens that were entirely domestic and not to or \nfrom a foreign intelligence target.  2011 WL 10945618. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 21\n  On January 29, 2014, Mr. Muhtorov filed his Motion to Suppress the fruits \nof the FAA surveillance because the government’s monitoring of his \ncommunications violated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and \nArticle III.  Doc. 520.   \n  Continuing to operate under the veil of secrecy, the government filed its \nMemorandum in Opposition to the Motion to Suppress on May 9, 2014. Doc. 559.  \nThe Unclassified version – and only version Mr. Muhtorov received – was like a \npiece of Swiss cheese, full of holes justified by the government as containing \nclassified information.7    Under the heading, “Overview of the FAA Collection at \nIssue,” all seven sections are redacted.  Doc. 559 at 2.   Likewise, under the \nheading, “Targeting Procedures,” two sections are redacted (Id. at 3), and under \nthe heading, “The Section 702 Information was Lawfully Acquired and Conducted \nin Conformity with an Order of Authorization or Approval / Relevant Facts,” all 15 \nsections are redacted.  Altogether, 32 sections and 15 footnotes are redacted \nfrom the government’s opposition brief. \n  With the government’s redacted Memorandum in Opposition, Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder has provided this Court with a Declaration and Claim of \nPrivilege. It asks, in the name of national security, that Mr. Muhtorov be denied \naccess to the redacted sections of the response, a request that ignores his \nconstitutionally protected rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, his rights \nunder Rule 16, and under Brady v. Maryland and its progeny.  The Attorney \n                                                 \n7 These portions of the brief are identified as CLASSIFIED MATERIAL \nREDACTED \n  8 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 21\nGeneral does not explain in his Declaration and Claim of Privilege why the \nstatutory remedies created by Congress to protect sensitive information are not \nadequate to address security concerns. Nor does he explain why defense \ncounsel cannot be given security clearance (a process followed in many national \nsecurity cases, including the Abel Daoud case in Chicago and the Mohamed \nOsman Mohamud case in Portland, Oregon) so they may have access to \nclassified information.  \n  Instead, the Court is asked to determine “In Camera, Ex Parte” (Doc. 569) \nthe issues that Mr. Muhtorov raised in his Motion (Doc. 520). 8  The government \nargues that Mr. Muhtorov should not (a) know the facts it relies on in opposing \nhis motion; (b) be afforded a full and fair hearing; (c) have his own lawyer \nadvocate on his behalf; or (d) know the basis on which it asserts this wide-\nreaching privilege.  \nEx Parte, In Camera Hearings Violate Fundamental Constitutional \nPrinciples \n  An ex parte, in camera hearing where discovery and a complete copy of \nthe government’s arguments and facts in opposition are not provided to the \ndefense is unconstitutional, violates FISA provisions, and offends the \nfundamental principles of our criminal justice system.   \n                                                 \n8 This sort of declaration always gets filed in these cases. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Daoud, 2014 WL 321384, *2 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 29, 2014). In the one filed \nhere, the Attorney General says he will submit a Declaration of Stephanie \nO’Sullivan, Acting Director of National Intelligence in support of his claim of \nprivilege.  This Declaration is TOP SECRET and will not be provided to Mr. \nMuhtorov or counsel. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 21\nThe Bill of Rights forms the backbone of our American system of justice.  \nThe first ten amendments to the United States Constitution are the “fundamental \nsafeguards of liberty immune from federal abridgement.”  Gideon v. Wainwright, \n372 U.S. 335 (1963).   Rights embodied in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments \nprotect both individuals and these fundamental principles of liberty and justice.  \n“The Sixth Amendment stands as a constant admonition that if constitutional \nsafeguards [are] lost, justice will not be done.”  Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, \n462). “To protect the interests of criminal defendants enmeshed in the midst of \nour adversarial system of justice, the Sixth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution guarantees each defendant the ‘assistance of counsel for his \ndefense.’  This guarantee ‘contemplates that such assistance be untrammeled \nand unimpaired.’” United States v. Dolan, 570 F.2d 1177, 1180 (3rd Cir.1978), \nquoting Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 70 (1942).  \nThe adversarial process is the bedrock of effective assistance of counsel \nprotected by the Sixth Amendment.  Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 743 \n(1967). The adversarial process is integral to safeguarding the rights of all \ncitizens, including those charged with a crime.  “The right to effective assistance \nof counsel is thus the right of the accused to require the prosecution’s case to \nsurvive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.”  United States v. Cronic, \n466 U.S. 648, 656 (1984).9 \n                                                 \n9 This principle was the  basis for U.S. District Judge Coleman’s recent decision \nordering disclosure in United States v. Daoud,  2014 WL 321384, *3 \n(N.D.Ill.2014)(“The Court finds . . . that an accurate determination of the legality \nof the surveillance is best made in this case as part of an adversarial \nproceeding.”) This ruling, appealed by the government, was recently re-argued in \n  10 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 21\nThe Fifth Amendment also entitles Mr. Muhtorov to an adversarial hearing \nwith the assistance of counsel. The Due Process Clause requires any person \naccused of a crime be present at all critical stages against him and be present \nand have hearings on critical issues.  The fundamental requirement of due \nprocess is the opportunity to be heard “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful \nmanner.”  Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976). “A defendant is \nguaranteed the right to be present at any stage of the criminal proceeding that is \ncritical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the \nprocedure.”  Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730 (1987).  \nThe Supreme Court has declared that “’[f]airness can rarely be obtained \nby secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights . . . No better \ninstrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy \nof serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.’” United \nStates v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43, 55 (1993) (quoting \nJoint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 170-72 (1951).  \nThe Court made the same point in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).  \nFranks held that a defendant must be permitted to attack the veracity of the \naffidavit underlying a search warrant, upon a preliminary showing of an \nintentional or reckless material falsehood.  The Court rested its decision on the \nex parte nature of the procedure for issuing a search warrant and the value of \nadversarial proceedings:  The usual reliance of our legal system on adversary \n                                                 \nthe Seventh Circuit following disclosure there was no recording of the first \n“public” arguments. http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/06/court-\norders-rare-redo-in-surveillance-case-189926.html (visited June 9, 2014) \n  11 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 21\nproceedings itself should indicate that an ex parte inquiry is likely to be less \nvigorous.   438 U.S. at 169 \n  The same considerations that the Court found compelling in Franks and \nJames Daniel Good militate against uniformly ex parte procedures in the FISA \ncontext.  As early as 2002, the FISC acknowledged (in an rare published opinion) \nthat without adversarial proceedings, systematic executive branch misconduct – \nincluding submission of dozens of FISA applications with “erroneous statements” \nand “omissions of material facts” – went undetected by the courts until the DOJ \nrevealed it.  See In re All Matters, 218 F. Supp. 2d 611, 620-21 (Foreign \nIntelligence surveillance Court) rev’d, 310 F.3d 717 (Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court of Review 2002).  \nEx Parte, In Camera Hearings are Not Required by 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f) \n  When a defendant (and “aggrieved person”) moves to suppress fruits of \nFISA surveillance or a FISA search, the Attorney General may file an affidavit \nthat “disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the \nUnited States.”10  Once an Attorney General files such an affidavit, as Attorney \nGeneral Holder has done here, the court must review the FISA application, order, \nand related materials ex parte and in camera, unless “disclosure [to the \ndefendant] is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the \n                                                 \n10 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f). \n  12 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 21\nsurveillance.”11 Under 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), any such disclosure must occur \n“under appropriate security procedures and protective orders.”   \n  As touched upon above, one District Court Judge has, for the first time, \nordered FISA materials be disclosed to the defense in a so-called terrorism case. \nUnited States v. Adel Daoud, (12-cr-723 N.Dist.Ill. Doc. 92). 12  In Daoud, the \ndefendant “filed a motion for disclosure of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978 (“FISA”) related material; . . . to suppress the fruits or derivatives of \nelectronic surveillance and any other means of collection conducted under FISA \nor other foreign intelligence gathering; [and] raised an issue about the legality of \nthe government’s surveillance.” Id., *1.   The district court found disclosure was \nan essential component of an adversarial proceeding; a proceeding for the court \nto make “an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.”  \nIn enacting FISA Congress anticipated that sometimes disclosure would \nbe ordered; specifically, when doing so would promote an accurate determination \nof a FISA order’s legality. See S. Rep. No. 701, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. at 64, \nreprinted 1978 U.S.Code & Cong. Admin. News 403.  \n                                                 \n11 Id.; see also id. § 1806(g) (if court determines surveillance or search was \n“lawfully authorized,” it shall deny motion to suppress “except to the extent due \nprocess requires discovery or disclosure”). \n12 Defense counsel in the Daoud case previously had security clearance.  \nHundreds of lawyers were given security clearance to represent detainees at \nGuantanamo and “there does not appear to be on record a single, reliable \nreported incident in which a detainee or his counsel mishandled classified \ninformation in a way that could compromise national security.”  Baher Azmy, \nExecutive Detention, Boumediene, and the New Common Law of Habeas, 95 \nIowa L. Rev. 445, 537 (2010). \n  13 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 21\nProvisions of FISA, itself, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g), require a \ncase-by-case analysis about the need for disclosure; there is no automatic rule \nagainst it.  \n The Attorney General filed an affidavit in this case that disclosure would \nharm national security. The Attorney General has always done so where a \ncriminal accused has sought suppression or disclosure of FISA material. David \nS. Kris & Douglas Wilson, 1 National Security Investigations and Prosecutions, § \n30:7 (2nd ed. 2012).  That the Attorney General has adopted a robotic approach \ndoes not mean courts must follow suit (although they did until Daoud).  \nHere, as in Daoud, disclosure focuses on the definition of “necessary” in \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).  The district court in Daoud defined “necessary” as meaning \nto “substantially promote an accurate determination of legality.”  This follows the \nlegislative history of FISA and its purpose to balance national security and civil \nliberties.  \nThe government asserts that “necessary” in 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f) means \n“essential” or “required,” an assertion at odds with the legislative history of FISA.  \nTwo Senate Reports – one from the Senate Judiciary Committee and the other \nfrom the Senate Intelligence Committee – discuss the provision that became  \n§1806.  The Reports provide:  \nThe extent to which the government should be required to surrender to the \nparties in a criminal trial the underlying documentation used to justify \nelectronic surveillance raises delicate problems and competing interests.  \nOn the one hand, broad rights of access to the documentation and \n  14 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 21\nsubsequent intelligence information can threaten the secrecy necessary to \neffective intelligence practices. However, the defendant’s constitutional \nguarantee of a fair trial could seriously be undercut if he is denied the \nmaterials needed to present a proper defense.  The Committee believes \nthat a just, effective balance has been struck in this section.   \n \nS. Rep. 604(I), 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 53, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3904, \n3954; see S. Rep. 701, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 59 (similar passage in Senate \nIntelligence Committee Report), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3973, 4028.   \nTurning to § 1806(f), the Committees, in discussing the disclosure \nprovision, observed:     \nThe decision whether it is necessary to order disclosure to a person is for \nthe Court to make after reviewing the underlying documentation and \ndetermining its volume, scope and complexity.  The committee has noted \nthe reasoned discussion of these matters in the opinion of the Court in \nUnited States v. Butenko, [494 F.2d 593 (3d. Cir. 1974) (en banc)].  There, \nthe Court, faced with the difficult problem of determining what standard to \nfollow when balancing national security interests with the right to a fair trial \nstated: \n“The distinguished district court judge reviewed in camera the records of \nthe wiretaps at issue here before holding the surveillances to be legal . . . \n[I]n some cases, the Court will likely be able to determine the legality of \nthe surveillance without any disclosure to the defendant.  In other cases, \nhowever, the question may be more complex because of, for example, \n  15 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 21\nindications of possible misrepresentation of fact, vague identification of the \npersons to be surveilled or surveillance records which includes [sic] a \nsignificant amount of nonforeign intelligence information, calling into \nquestion compliance with the minimization standards contained in the \norder.  In such cases, the committee contemplates that the court will likely \ndecide to order disclosure to the defendant, in whole or in part since such \ndisclosure “is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality \nof the surveillance.”   \nS. Rep. 604(I), 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 58-59, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3904, \n3959-60; see S. Rep. 701, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 64-65 (identical language in \nSenate Intelligence Committee Report), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3973, \n4033-44. \n  This reflects the balanced approach the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittee meant for courts to take when deciding whether disclosure was \nwarranted. \nStriking a sound balance between the need for such surveillance and the \nprotection of civil liberties lies at the heart of [the Act].... [It] is designed to \npermit the Government to gather necessary foreign intelligence \ninformation by means of electronic surveillance but under limitations and \naccording to procedural guidelines which will better safeguard the rights of \nindividuals. \nUnited States v. Megahey  553 F.Supp. 1180, 1184 (D.C.N.Y., 1982). \n  16 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 21\nThe citation to Butenko, a pre-FISA decision, reflects a congressional \nintent to give district judges broad discretion when deciding when disclosure is \n“necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.”   \nThis suggests the “necessary” standard is met when the district court determines \nthat “adversary presentation would substantially promote a more accurate \ndecision.”   \nThe Committees also noted the district court’s “broad discretionary power \nto excise certain sensitive portions” from the FISA materials before disclosure.  \nThis discretionary power has a statutory basis in CIPA and substantially \nameliorates the government’s professed national security concerns. \nCIPA Procedures Can apply to Review of Classified Pleadings \n  Congress enacted the Classified Information Procedures Act (“CIPA”) in \n1980 that outlines the procedures and conditions already in place for defense \ncounsel to review classified discovery. Presumably, the redacted classified \nportions of the government’s pleadings are relevant and came from discovery not \ndisclosed.  CIPA procedures can be used for defense counsel to access the \nclassified pleadings and information contained therein. \nFirst, CIPA provides for entry of a protective order.13 The CIPA protective \norder requires defense counsel and other members of the defense team to obtain \nsecurity clearances before receiving access to classified discovery.  The \nprotective order also requires the defense to maintain all classified information in \na Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility or SCIF – usually in the federal \n                                                 \n13 18 U.S.C. App. 3 § 3. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 21\ncourthouse and protected by locks and other security devices.  The SCIF \ncontains safes to hold classified documents, secure computers on which to \nprepare classified pleadings and other approved equipment.   \nOnce the protective order is in place, defense counsel has clearance, and \nthe SCIF is ready, the parties begin the classified discovery process.  CIPA § 4 \ngoverns this process.  It allows the court to authorize the government, “upon a \nsufficient show,” to delete classified information from the discovery it provides or \nto furnish substitutions for the classified information in summaries or admissions.  \nThe statute adds that “[t]he court may permit the United States to make a request \nfor such authorization in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the \ncourt alone.”  18 U.S.C. App. 3 § 4.  CIPA contains additional procedures \ngoverning the use of classified information at trial and in hearings and giving the \ngovernment a right of interlocutory appeal.  See 18 U.S.C. App. 3 §§ 5, 6, 7, 8.  \nIn Mr. Muhtorov’s case, he government has already invoked the CIPA § 4 \nprocedures.  See e.g. Doc. 124. \nFor over 30 years, classified information has been disclosed under CIPA \nin federal criminal cases – without, as far as counsel are aware, a serious \nsecurity violation by the defense. See, e.g., United States v. Lee, 99-cr-1417 JAP \n(U.S. District Court, New Mexico- Albuquerque), Doc. 15, CIPA protective order, \n12-15-1999. In Lee, CIPA procedures were employed in a case involving \nclassified national security information, nuclear weapon codes; codes capable of \n“changing the strategic global balance” that “represented the gravest possible \nsecurity risk to the United States.”  United States v. Lee, 2000WL228263, at *2 \n  18 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 21\n(10th Cir. Feb. 29, 2000). See Richard B. Zabel & James J. Benjamin, Jr., Human \nRights First, In Pursuit of Justice: Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in Federal Courts \nat 85 (May 2008) (concluding, after studying eighteen terrorism cases involving \nCIPA, that “CIPA has provided a flexible, practical mechanism for problems \nposed by classified evidence”).14  \nConclusion \nThe Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 50 \nU.S.C. §§1806(f),1825(g),  and CIPA, support Mr. Muhtorov’s request that this \nCourt order the government to disclose to defense counsel its Classified \nMemorandum (Doc. 569).   \nMr. Muhtorov asks the Court to find under 50 U.S.C. 1806(f) that \ndisclosure and subsequent adversarial proceedings will substantially promote the \naccuracy of the district court’s determination of the legal issues raised in the \nmotion to suppress. He also asks that his lawyers be given security clearances \nand that the process of disclosure be accomplished under CIPA and appropriate \nprotective orders.  \n \n \n                                                 \n14 The 2009 update to this article concluded that “[t]he Classified Information \nProcedures Act (CIPA), although subject to being improved, is working as it  \nshould: we were unable to identify a single instance in which CIPA was invoked \nand there was a substantial leak of sensitive information as a result of a terrorism \nprosecution in federal court.” Human Rights First, In Pursuit of Justice: \nProsecuting Terrorism Cases in Federal Courts, Preface and at p. 25 (May 2009 \nUpdate and Recent Developments). http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/pdf/090723-LS-in-pursuit-justice-09-update.pdf(visited June 12, \n2014) \n \n  19 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 584   Filed 06/12/14   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 21\n Without waiving these requests, Mr. Muhtorov asks: \nIf there is no disclosure, the government’s classified memorandum in \nresponse be stricken; and \nIf the Court finds – after ex parte review in camera – that some or all of the \nevidence the government proposes to use was gathered illegally, it conduct a \ntaint hearing in which he and his lawyers are full participants. \n \n  Respectfully submitted this 12th day of June, 2014,  \n \n \n             \n          By:  /s/ Kathryn J.

Muhtorov has previously moved to be permitted to enter ex parte, in camera \nClassified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) proceedings, in contravention of the CIPA \nstatute Congress has enacted and the courts have upheld, on the theory that the \nadversarial process is preferred. Dkt. 116 & 128. This Court denied the defendant’s \nprevious request. Dkt. 135. Now, in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) \nproceedings, Defendant Muhtorov, joined by his co-defendant, again seeks to \ncircumvent the procedure Congress has enacted and the courts have upheld by seeking \naccess to classified information without meeting the statutory requirements for \ndisclosure. In doing so, Muhtorov’s memorandum echoes arguments recently made and \nrejected in United States v. Daoud, 2014 WL 2696734 (7th Cir. June 16, 2014).  For the \nreasons stated below, this Court should again reject defendants’ request for improper \naccess to classified information. \n50 U.S.C. 1806(f) \nFISA permits the government to use in a criminal prosecution information \nobtained or derived from a FISA order, provided that advance authorization is obtained \nfrom the Attorney General, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(b), 1825(c), and that notice is given to \nthe Court and to each “aggrieved person” against whom the information is to be used. \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c)-(d), 1825(d)-(e), 1881e(a). The aggrieved person, upon receiving \nnotice, may seek discovery of the “applications or orders or other materials relating to” \nthe electronic surveillance or physical search and may also seek to suppress evidence \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 18\nobtained from the surveillance or search if “the information was unlawfully acquired” or if \nthe surveillance or search “was not made in conformity with an order of authorization or \napproval.’’ Id. §§ 1806(e), 1825(f), 1881e(a).   \nIn his motion, Defendant Muhtorov lays out some of the language of 50 U.S.C. § \n1806(f), requiring the Court to make an ex parte, in camera evaluation of the legality of \nthe surveillance, and he asks this Court to find that disclosure to the defense is \nnecessary for this Court to determine the legality of the surveillance. The defendant \nfurther requests “that the disclosures he seeks be made before the Court conducts a \nhearing on the legal issues raised in his Motion to Suppress.” Dkt. 584 at 2-3. \nDefendant Jumaev adopts Muhtorov’s motion, Dkt. 590 at 5, and requests that the \nCourt make no decision on the suppression motion until defendants have been provided \naccess, id. at 1.  \nThe statute, however, does not allow a defendant this form of relief unless the \nCourt finds, after conducting its own ex parte, in camera review of the FISA material, \nthat disclosure of “portions” of those materials “is necessary to make an accurate \ndetermination of the legality of the surveillance.” 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f). If the Court is \ncapable of making a legality determination without the assistance of defense counsel, it \nmust do so.1 See, e.g., United States v. El-Mezain, 664 F.3d 467, 565 (5th Cir. 2011); \nUnited States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 129 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v. \n                                                           \n1 This same procedure applies to motions to disclose Section702-related materials or to \nsuppress information obtained or derived from Section 702 acquisitions, which is deemed to be \nelectronic surveillance conducted pursuant to Title I of FISA for purposes of such motions.  50 \nU.S.C. § 1881e(a). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 18\nDamrah, 412 F.3d 618, 624 (6th Cir. 2005); United States v. Squillacote, 221 F.3d 542, \n553-54 (4th Cir. 2000); United States v. Badia, 827 F.2d 1458, 1464 (11th Cir. 1987); \nUnited States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Clearly the statutory \nmandate is that “[d]isclosure of FISA materials is the exception and ex parte, in camera \ndetermination is the rule.” El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at 567 (citing Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at \n129); United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 78 (2d Cir. 1984) (same); United States v. \nRosen, 447 F. Supp. 2d 538, 546 (E.D. Va. 2006); see also Belfield, 692 F.2d at 147 \n(“The language of section 1806(f) clearly anticipates that an ex parte, in camera \ndetermination is to be the rule. Disclosure and an adversary hearing are the exception, \noccurring only when necessary.”) (emphasis in original); United States v. Isa, 923 F.2d \n1300, 1306 (8th Cir. 1991). As courts have observed, a case in which “disclosure is \nnecessary” is “one-in-a-million.” In re Grand Jury Proceedings of Special April 2002 \nGrand Jury, 347 F.3d 197, 203 (7th Cir. 2003) (affirming district court’s decision not to \ndisclose FISA applications and orders based on the court’s own review of the record). \n  Defendant Muhtorov cites a district court order from United States v. Daoud, \n2014 WL 321384, *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 29, 2014), for the proposition that FISA materials \nwere recently ordered disclosed for the first time. Dkt. 584, at 10 n.9, 13.  However, as \nDefendant Jumaev notes,2 the Seventh Circuit more recently reversed that order, \nfinding that the district court had failed to comply with the requirement of the statute that \nit first make an ex parte, in camera determination that disclosure to the defense was \n                                                           \n2 Jumaev, however, mischaracterized the Seventh Circuit’s ruling.  The Seventh Circuit did not \nhold that a district court is obliged “to disclose such [FISA] materials to defense counsel in order \nfor the court to make an accurate determination of the legality of the challenged surveillance.”  \nDkt. 590 at 5 n.1.    \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 18\n“necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.” United \nStates v. Daoud, 2014 WL 2696734, at * 2. Notably, the Seventh Circuit did not credit \nDaoud’s argument, the same argument that Defendant Muhtorov advances here, that \n“necessary” should be construed to mean would “substantially promote an accurate \ndetermination of legality,” in reviewing the legislative history Muhtorov offers in his \nmotion. Indeed, every court that has applied § 1806(f), including this Court in the prior \nFISA suppression litigation, has understood the provision to mean what it says—that \nthat disclosure must be “necessary” or “needed” to adjudicate the lawfulness of the \nsurveillance. See, e.g., El- Mezain, 664 F.3d at 565-66 (district court did not “need the \nassistance of defense counsel to make an accurate determination of the legality of the \nsurveillance”); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 347 F.3d at 203 (“there is no need to \ndisclose any of the FISA materials”); Squillacote, 221 F.3d at 554 (denying request for \ndisclosure “because the documents submitted by the government were sufficient for the \n[court] to determine the legality of the surveillance”); Belfield, 692 F.2d at 147 \n(“Disclosure and an adversary hearing are the exception, occurring only when \nnecessary.”). Thus, before considering disclosure of classified FISA materials to \ndefense counsel, “the district judge must, in a non-public (“in camera”), nonadversarial \n(“ex parte”) proceeding, attempt to determine whether the surveillance was proper.”  \nDaoud, 2014 WL 2696734, at *2.  If the Court is able to make that determination, \ndisclosure to defense counsel is unwarranted. \nThe Propriety of a Redacted Classified Filing and Ex Parte Classified Hearing  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 18\n  In the alternative, Muhtorov requests that the Court strike the government’s \nclassified memorandum in its entirety and consider only the unclassified portions of the \ngovernment’s response. Dkt. 584 at 3-4. The defendant cites no authority that would \nsupport this request. Moreover, for a second time in this case, the Muhtorov makes the \nmeritless argument that ex parte, in camera hearings violate fundamental constitutional \nprinciples and cites general case law to that effect. Id. at 9-12. Jumaev also cites \ngeneral case law disfavoring ex parte pleadings. Dkt. 590 at 7-17.  This Court has \nalready rejected such arguments and should do so again. \nWhen it enacted FISA, Congress was fully aware of the benefits of adversary \nprocess, and it balanced those against the exceptional costs that would be incurred by \nrevealing “sensitive foreign intelligence information.” S. Rep. No. 95-701, 95th Cong., 2d \nSess. 64, at 57 (1978); see also Belfield, 692 F.2d at 148 (noting that Congress was \n“aware” of the difficulties of ex parte procedures, but that Congress made a “thoroughly \nreasonable attempt to balance the competing concerns of individual privacy and foreign \nintelligence.”). All courts that have considered the constitutionality of such an in camera, \nex parte examination have held such examinations to be constitutional. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476-77 (9th Cir. 1987); Duggan, 743 F.2d at 78; \nBelfield, 692 F.2d at 147; United States v. Spanjol, 720 F. Supp. 55, 58-60 (E.D. Pa. \n1989); United States v. Megahey, 553 F. Supp. 1180, 1193-94 (E.D.N.Y. 1982); United \nStates v. Falvey, 540 F. Supp. 1306, 1315-16 (E.D.N.Y. 1982). The defendants cannot \ncite a single case, besides the recently reversed district court order in Daoud, in which a \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 18\ncourt has found the adversarial process to be the appropriate way to handle FISA \nlitigation.  \nOther ex parte procedures are a familiar part of criminal procedure. Rule 16(d)(l) \ncontains an oft-used provision: “the court may permit a party to show good cause [for \nrelief from discovery] by a written statement that the court will inspect ex parte. If relief is \ngranted, the court must preserve the entire text of the party’s statement under seal.” F. \nR. Crim. P. 16(d)(l); see also United States v. lnnamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 487 (1st Cir. \n1993) (“[Rule] 16(d)(l) expressly authorizes the court to deny discovery of information \nsought by a defendant based on an ex parte showing by the Government of the need \nfor confidentiality.”); see generally United States v. Rezaq, 134 F.3d 1121, 1142 (D.C. \nCir. 1998). Courts have held that ex parte, in camera proceedings are appropriate under \nRule 16(d)(1).  See, e.g., United States v. Hanna, 661 F.3d 271, 294-95 (6th Cir. 2011); \nUnited States v. Pringle, 751 F.2d 419, 427-28 (1st Cir. 1984); United States v. Pelton, \n578 F.2d 701,707 (8th Cir. 1978) (ex parte, in camera proceedings appropriate where \nprosecutors were concerned about safety of individuals if certain tapes were disclosed \nto defense). \nLikewise, under CIPA, the rationale of authorizing ex parte submissions is logical.  \nAs the Ninth Circuit has observed – citing the legislative history of CIPA Section 4 – \nwhere “the Government is seeking to withhold classified information from the defendant, \nan adversary hearing with defense knowledge would defeat the very purpose of the \ndiscovery rules.”  United States v. Sarkissian, 841 F.2d 959, 965 (9th Cir. 1988) \n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 96-831, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., at 27 n.22 (1980)). See also \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 18\nUnited States v. Zazi, 2011 WL 2532903, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (finding that disclosure \nof the classified information to defense counsel “would be particularly anomalous, as it \nwould provide defense counsel access to sensitive information to which, if the \ngovernment is correct, they are not entitled under any theory”). In United States v. \nCampa, 529 F.3d 980, 995 (11th Cir. 2008), the court reasoned, “[t]he right that section \nfour confers on the government would be illusory if defense counsel were allowed to \nparticipate in section four proceedings because defense counsel would be able to see \nthe information that the government asks the district court to keep from defense \ncounsel’s view.” \n  In United States v. Mejia, 448 F.3d 436 (D.C. Cir. 2006), the court, having \nrejected defendant’s contention that he was entitled to access to classified materials in \na CIPA Section 4 motion, noted that criminal prosecutions routinely involve discovery \ndeterminations from which the defense is excluded:    \nWe recognize . . .  that the defendants and their counsel, who are in the best \nposition to know whether information would be helpful to their defense, are \ndisadvantaged by not being permitted to see the [classified] information  — and \nthus to assist the court in its assessment of the information’s helpfulness . . . .We \nnote, however, that while the defendants’ predicament is difficult, it is not without \nclose analogies. When a court (rather than the prosecutor alone, as is ordinarily \nthe case) reviews evidence in camera to determine whether it constitutes a \nwitness statement subject to disclosure under the Jencks Act . . . , or exculpatory \nmaterial subject to disclosure under Brady the defendant is likewise “not entitled \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 18\nto access to any of the evidence reviewed by the court . . . to assist in his \nargument” that it should be disclosed. \nId. at 458.   \n  As the Seventh Circuit recently acknowledged in Daoud: “The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act is an attempt to strike a balance between the interest in full \nopenness of legal proceedings and the interest in national security, which requires a \ndegree of secrecy concerning the government’s efforts to protect the nation . . . . \nConventional adversary procedure thus has to be compromised in recognition of valid \nsocial interests that compete with the social interest in openness.” 2014 WL 2696734, at \n*4.   Defendants’ arguments that hearings on FISA discovery must be open and \nadversarial disregard the balance Congress struck when it enacted FISA provisions that \nprovide due process to defendants while protecting the crucial interests in national \nsecurity. There is no Sixth Amendment right to have counsel present for a classified, \npretrial determination, see United States v. Abu Ali, 528 F.3d 210, 254 (4th Cir. 2008), \nand the FISA process enacted by Congress has been upheld by every court that has \nconsidered the constitutionality of the statute. See, e.g., Damrah, 412 F.3d at 624-25; \nIsa, 923 F.2d at 1306-07; Ott, 827 F.2d at 476–77; Belfield, 692 F.2d at 148-49.  \nThere is similarly no basis for Defendant Muhtorov’s objection to a classified, ex \nparte hearing. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit recently observed that there appears to be no \nauthority to support such an argument. Daoud, 2014 WL 2696734, at *6.  That court \nfollowed the Ninth Circuit’s practice in conducting such a hearing.  See United States v. \nSedaghaty, 728 F.3d 885, 891 & n. 2 (9th Cir. 2013); cf. American Civil Liberties Union \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 18\nv. Department of Justice, 681 F.3d 61, 66, 70 (2d Cir. 2012). The Daoud court also \nnoted that the defense’s objection to the classified hearing was “ironic” as the “purpose \nof the hearing was to explore, by questioning the government’s lawyer on the basis of \nthe classified materials, the need for defense access to those materials (which the \njudges and their cleared staffs had read). In effect this was cross-examination of the \ngovernment, and could only help the defendant.”  Daoud, 2014 WL 2696734, at *6.  \nFinally, the defendants’ objection to the government’s ex parte filing of a classified brief, \nwith a redacted version filed on the public record, something which the government \ndoes in every FISA case including the original FISA litigation in this case, is also \nbaseless. See Sedaghaty, 728 F.3d at 908 n.12 (“[The defendant] moved to strike the \nclassified, ex parte appellate briefs and excerpts of record filed by the government or, in \nthe alternative, to request access for his security-cleared counsel and expert to the \ndocuments. We denied the motion for the same reasons discussed below with regard to \nthe requirements of CIPA.”). \nThe defendants’ request to prevent the government from providing its full account \nof the surveillance that occurred in this case, either in its classified pleading or in any \nsubsequent hearing, would impair the operation of one of the fundamental safeguards \nof FISA: that the district court have access to the information needed for an ex parte, in \ncamera review of the propriety of the surveillance, and thus perform an important check \non the government, without the government having to unnecessarily share that sensitive \ninformation with the defense. The defendants acknowledge that the Court can review \nthe classified FISA applications and orders and other materials itself ex parte and in \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 18\ncamera, but argues that the Court cannot review the government’s explanation of those \nmaterials or ask any questions to test the government’s assertions without defense \ncounsel present. This would deprive the Court of the means of acquiring information \nrelevant to the decision before it, means that would readily be available in any motion \nthe government made under Rule 16(d). The government’s compelling interest in \nprotecting ongoing national security investigations and intelligence sources and \nmethods, coupled with the protections found in other parts of FISA, justifies limiting the \ndefendants’ right to review the FISA applications and orders – and the information \nderived from them – especially given the relatively straightforward task of assessing the \nlawfulness of initiating surveillance, which district courts do on a regular basis when \napproving or evaluating criminal search warrants.  See Isa, 923 F.2d at 1307; see also \nKaley v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1090, 1103 (2014) (“This Court has repeatedly \ndeclined to require the use of adversarial procedures to make probable cause \ndeterminations.”). \nJumaev’s Additional Arguments in Favor of Disclosure \nBecause the government is not entering into evidence or otherwise using or \ndisclosing information obtained or derived from Section 702 collection to which Jumaev \nis aggrieved in this prosecution, he has no standing to challenge the constitutionality of \nSection 702 or the Section 702 collection at issue in this case. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c), \n1881e(a). Defendant Jumaev has not accepted the government’s assertion that he does \nnot meet the statutory test for notice and cannot seek suppression of Section 702 \nobtained or derived materials, and, therefore, the government has provided the Court ex \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 18\nparte with classified information which shows that Jumaev does not meet the statutory \ntest for notice and has no standing to challenge to the statute or collection that occurred \nin the case. The portion of the government’s response to Muhtorov’s suppression \nmotion which pertains to Jumaev does so only to again explain that he has no standing \nto adopt Muhtorov’s motion. Likewise, Jumaev lacks standing to file his instant motion to \nadopt Muhtorov’s objection to partially classified pleadings. There is nothing for Jumaev \nto move to suppress, and therefore he cannot object to the Court’s consideration of \nMuhtorov’s suppression motion without disclosure of the classified portions of the \nGovernment’s response. Defendant Jumaev’s arguments regarding any ambiguity that \nexists in the term “derived from” have no bearing on this case. Dkt. 590 at 5-7.  \nJumaev makes additional, irrelevant arguments in support of his pleading. As to \nJumaev’s speculation that discoverable material exists within the redacted material, Dkt. \n590 at 7-9, there is no basis for this assertion. The government understands, has \ncomplied with, and intends to continue complying with its discovery obligations, \nincluding declassifying or providing through CIPA any materials currently classified. \nDisclosure of any of the FISA materials is not permitted unless “necessary” to \nadjudicate the lawfulness of the surveillance. 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).   \nJumaev’s arguments that an FAA suppression motion is somehow different from \nan ordinary FISA suppression motion, or that this is a case of first impression for this \nCourt, Dkt. 590 at 9-10, similarly have no bearing on the statute Congress passed, \nwhich requires ex parte, in camera review of the FISA materials by the Court.  \nMoreover, his claims that “[t]he FISC is not authorized to address the constitutionality of \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 18\nthe FAA” and that “no court” has ever done so are patently wrong.  Dkt. 590 at 10.  The \nstatute permits the FISC to authorize a certification only if it finds, among other things, \nthat the targeting and minimization procedures are consistent with both the statute and \nthe Fourth Amendment, the latter of which would be violated if the statutory definition of \nsuch procedures or the proposed acquisitions themselves were unconstitutional.  See \n50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(3)(A).  A recently declassified FISC opinion establishes that the \nFISC has complied with this statutory mandate and closely scrutinized the \nconstitutionality of such procedures in each certification.  See [Caption Redacted], 2011 \nWL 10945618, at *6 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011).   \nJumaev also argues that the government should have sought leave of Court \nbefore filing ex parte, but acknowledges that § 1806(f) explicitly allows and provides for \nex parte submission. Dkt. 590 at 15 (“While 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f) allows the government, \nunder specified circumstances to submit materials ex parte to the district court for an in \ncamera review, Mr. Jumaev should not have to guess that such a proceeding is \noccurring.”). The government has not concealed that an ex parte filing, permitted by \nFISA, occurred; indeed, the government filed a notice to inform defendants. Dkt. 569. \nGeneral arguments that ex parte proceedings are disfavored or that they have not been \npermitted in other contexts ignore Congress’s contrary determination embodied in FISA \nand the FAA. Dkt. 590 at 11-20. \n   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 18\nRequest for Alternate Relief Under CIPA \nDefendant Muhtorov’s argument, invoked by Jumaev, that CIPA provides an \nalternate mechanism for the defense to access classified FISA material is erroneous. As \nan initial matter, FISA disclosure matters are not covered by CIPA, but by the specific \nprocedures set forth in FISA.  And, in any event, defense counsel does not have access \nto classified information under the procedures outlined in CIPA unless he or she has a \n“need to know” that information for a case-related purpose. It would be impossible for \ndefense counsel to have a “need to know” in the FISA context unless the Court finds \nthat such access is “necessary” to determine the legality of the surveillance. \nAs was already previously discussed in CIPA litigation in this case, the mere \npossession of a clearance does not entitle defense counsel access to classified \ninformation. Counsel must also have a “need to know.”  See Executive Order 13526, §§ \n4.1(a) and 6.1(dd) (requiring that a “need to know” determination be made prior to the \ndisclosure of classified information to anyone, including those who possess a security \nclearance); El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at 568 (“We are unpersuaded by the defendants' \nargument that the Government’s interest [in protecting classified information from \ndisclosure to defense counsel] is diminished because defense counsel possess security \nclearance to review classified material.”); United States v. Amawi, 2009 WL 961143 \n(N.D. Ohio, Apr. 7, 2009) (cleared counsel denied access to CIPA classified information \nbecause they had no need to know); United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 2007 WL 2972623, at \n*2 (D. Conn. Oct. 11, 2007) (citing United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 168 (2d Cir. \n2003); Mejia, 448 F.3d at 455-56; United States v. Yunis, 867 F.2d 617, 621-25 (D.C. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 18\nCir. 1989); United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp. 2d 18, 24 & n.8 (D.D.C. 2006) (security \nclearance alone does not justify disclosure because access to classified information is \npermitted only upon a showing that there is a “need to know”); accord United States v. \nBin Laden, 126 F. Supp. 2d 264, 287 n. 27 (S.D.N.Y 2000); see generally Ott, 827 F.2d \nat 476-77 (“Congress has a legitimate interest in authorizing the Attorney General to \ninvoke procedures designed to ensure that sensitive security information is not \nunnecessarily disseminated to anyone not involved in the surveillance operation in \nquestion, whether or not she happens for unrelated reasons to enjoy security \nclearance.”) (rejecting the contention that the clearance of counsel creates a due \nprocess right of access to classified materials in a FISA litigation case). Where, as here, \nit is not “necessary” under FISA for the defense to access classified FISA application \nmaterials, defense counsel simply has no “need to know” and CIPA has no role. \nIndeed, the Daoud court rejected the very CIPA-based circumvention of FISA \nthat the defendants propose here: \n[The district court judge] seems to have thought that any concerns about \ndisclosure were dissolved by defense counsel’s security clearances. She said \nthat “the government had no meaningful response to the argument by defense \ncounsel that the supposed national security interest at stake is not implicated \nwhere defense counsel has the necessary security clearances”— as if disclosing \nstate secrets to cleared lawyers could not harm national security. Not true. \nThough it is certainly highly unlikely that Daoud’s lawyers would, Snowden-like, \npublicize classified information in violation of federal law, they might in their zeal \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 18\nto defend their client, to whom they owe a duty of candid communication, or \nmisremembering what is classified and what not, inadvertently say things that \nwould provide clues to classified material. Unless and until a district judge \nperforms his or her statutory duty of attempting to determine the legality of the \nsurveillance without revealing any of the fruits of the surveillance to defense \ncounsel, there is no basis for concluding that disclosure is necessary in order to \navert an erroneous conviction. \n2014 WL 2696734, at *4. Because the “need to know” for FISA application materials is \ngoverned by the “necessary” standard, “[i]f the district judge’s threshold inquiry into \nwhether Daoud’s lawyers needed any of the surveillance materials revealed that they \ndidn’t, their security clearances would not entitle them to any of those materials.”  Id. at \n5.  CIPA, even if it applied here, would not allow a defendant to circumvent the \nprocedures enacted by Congress in FISA. \nOther Requested Relief \n  To the extent Defendant Muhtorov requests a taint hearing under Alderman v. \nUnited States, 394 U.S. 165, 180-81 (1969), on the assumption that the Court will find \nthe surveillance was illegal (Dkt. 584, at 3-4), such a motion is, at the least, premature, \nas no such finding has been made. The government thus asks that this relief be denied \nat this time without prejudice to refiling in the event that the Court finds any illegality. \n \n   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 600   Filed 07/02/14   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 18\nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated above, the defendants’ motions should be denied. \n \nRespectfully submitted this 2nd day of July, 2014. \n \n \n          JOHN F.

Hegarty              \nMichael E. Hegarty\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 24   Filed 02/15/12   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 6\nUnited States v. Jamshid Muhtorov\nCase No. 12-cr-00033-CMA\nFINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, and\nREASONS FOR ORDER OF DETENTION\nIn order to sustain a motion for detention, the government must establish that (a) there is no\ncondition or combination of conditions which could be imposed in connection with pretrial release\nthat would reasonably insure the defendant’s presence for court proceedings; or (b) there is no\ncondition or combination of conditions which could be imposed in connection with pretrial release\nthat would reasonably insure the safety of any other person or the community.\nIf there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed an offense which carries\na maximum term of imprisonment of over 10 years and is an offense prescribed by the Controlled\nSubstances Act, or if the defendant is charged with a crime of violence, a rebuttable presumption\narises that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required and the safety of the community.\nThe Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), directs the court to consider the following factors\nin determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of\nthe defendant as required and the safety of any other person and the community:\n(1) [t]he nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense\nis a crime of violence or involves a narcotic drug;\n(2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the person, including – \n(A) the  person’s  character,  physical  and  mental  condition,  family  ties,\nemployment, financial resources, length of residence in the community,\ncommunity ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse,\ncriminal history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings; and\n(B) whether at the time of the current offense or arrest, the person was on\nprobation, on parole, or on other release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or\ncompletion of sentence for an offense under Federal, State or local law; and\n(4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would\nbe posed by the person’s release.\nThe Court has taken judicial notice of the court’s file, the pretrial services report, and the\nevidence produced and comments of counsel at the hearing. Weighing the statutory factors set forth\n1\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 24   Filed 02/15/12   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 6\nin the Bail Reform Act, I find the following:\nThe Indictment issued in this case charges Defendant with a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B,\nMaterial Support of a Designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and Attempt to Do the Same.  The\nparties dispute whether a rebuttable presumption of detention applies here.  Under 18 U.S.C. §\n3142(e)(3)(C),1 “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community if [the Court] finds\nthat there is probable cause to believe that the person committed . . . an offense listed in section\n2332b(g)(5)(B) of title 18, United States Code, for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10\nyears or more is prescribed.”  Subsection (g)(5)(B)(i) lists within the definition of “Federal crimes\nof terrorism” a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B, the charge in this case.  That charge carries with it\na maximum prison term of 15 years. The plain language of the detention statutes requires a\npresumption of detention here.\nConcerning another preliminary procedural issue, the Defendant requested that I suppress\nthe information obtained by the Government pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n(FISA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811, 18211-1829.  Such information was used both in the Affidavit in\nsupport of the original Complaint in this case, and at the detention hearing.  Defendant made a\ntimely motion to suppress.  I agree FISA requires that, in the event a Defendant who is an aggrieved\nperson files a motion to suppress FISA information which the Government intends to use in any\n“hearing, or other proceeding,” the Court must engage in certain procedures, which includes viewing\nthe material in camera in order to determine whether the “surveillance of the aggrieved person was\nlawfully authorized and conducted.”  50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).  In apparent contradiction to this statute,\n18 U.S.C. § 3142(f) states that the rules of admissibility do not apply to the consideration of\nevidence for purposes of pretrial detention.  In United States v.  Hightower, 203 F.3d 836 (Table),\n2000 WL 136813 (10th Cir. Feb. 7, 2000) (unpublished), the Tenth Circuit acknowledged that\ninformation suppressed by the district court was also used in that court to detain the defendant.  The\norder of suppression was under review by the Tenth Circuit and, if affirmed, would likely have\nresulted in the release of the defendant.  The Tenth Circuit was content to allow the defendant to\nremain in custody on the basis of evidence that had been ordered suppressed, relying on the\nprovision in Section 3142(f).  I believe adherence to Hightower permits reliance on the FISA\nmaterial even if ultimately determined to be inadmissible.  I found no contrary case law requiring\na suppression hearing prior to the detention decision and find the Government’s argument on this\nissue the more persuasive position.\nI note that in light of the Indictment in this case, probable cause exists to sustain the charges\nbrought against Defendant.\n \n1At the hearing counsel for the United States mistakenly referenced Section\n3142(e)(3)(B), which would not lead to a rebuttable presumption since 18 U.S.C. § 2339B is not \n“an offense under” Section 2332b but, rather, a defined “Federal act of terrorism” listed in\nSection 2332b.\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 24   Filed 02/15/12   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 6\nI find by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant represents a risk of nonappearance.\nDefendant’s status in the United States is that of a refugee from Uzbekistan. Defendant was\napprehended attempting to board an airplane on a one-way ticket to Turkey.  He had resigned his\nonly gainful employment immediately prior to this trip.  Before this flight, he had told his minor\ndaughter that he may not see her again on earth but, if she is good, would see her in heaven.  In\naddition, Defendant had an earlier argument with his wife,2 specifically arguing that she must choose\nhim or choose her mother (at a time when Defendant’s wife was planning an extended visit overseas\nto her family).  At that time his wife accused him of wanting to leave the family “for Turkey.”  I also\nfind relevant Defendant’s prior experience with the incarceration, in Uzbekistan, of his sister, which\nhe has worked tirelessly to remedy and which appears to have some connection with (or perhaps is\nthe genesis of ) the “material support to terrorist organization” allegations raised by the Government\nhere.  The prospect of Defendant’s potential incarceration in this case, coupled with his apparent\npolitical beliefs and the situation with his sister, give me grave concerns, beyond the typical case,\nthat the Defendant would flee to avoid prosecution.  It is also apparent that he has the wherewithal\nto travel internationally, albeit, in this situation, it would have to be without his passport which has\nbeen surrendered to the Clerk of the Court.  Finally, and not insignificantly, Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement has issued a detainer for Defendant and could, theoretically, remove the\nDefendant prior to his prosecution under the current Indictment.\nMoreover, I find by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant represents a risk to other\npersons or the community.  The testimony in this case reasonably leads to the conclusion that the\nDefendant is willing to sacrifice his own life for his Bay’ah - his oath of allegiance to the Islamic\nJihad Union (IJU).  Defendant was apprehended on his way to Turkey.  The Government alleges in\nparagraph 9 of the Affidavit of FBI Special Agent Donald Hale that in April 2009, Turkish\nauthorities seized weapons and detained extremists associated with the IJU.  Defendant was leaving\nbehind his wife and children and taking with him over $2800.00 (having purchased an airline ticket\nthat cost in excess of $1000.00) despite his statement to authorities, upon his arrest, that he could\nbarely support his family.  The Government also proffered a discussion Defendant had with a\nwitness, who related that Defendant’s understanding of Islam is of the more radical version,\nsupporting “jihad” or holy war, and that Defendant’s “teachers” in his faith are Anwar al-Awlaki\nand Osama bin Laden.  I have a grave concern that, rather than go to jail in the United States,\nDefendant is at risk of choosing an alternative that would present a risk to other persons or the\ncommunity.\nAs a result, after considering all of these factors, I conclude there is a preponderance of the\nevidence that no condition or combination of conditions for release will reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s appearance for court proceedings, and there is clear and convincing evidence that the\nDefendant is a threat to the community, especially in light of the presumption of detention in this\n2There was some discussion about whether I would rely upon intercepted conversations\nbetween Defendant and his wife.  Defense counsel ultimately determined that Defendant would\nnot object to my use of such conversations, primarily in reliance upon conversations that\nsupported Defendant’s theories of risk of flight and risk to the community.\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 24   Filed 02/15/12   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 6\ncase.\n4",

JAMSHID MUHTOROV,\n2. BAKHTIYOR JUMAEV,\nDefendants.\nORDER DENYING MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE OBTAINED OR\nDERIVED UNDER FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OR FOR DISCOVERY (Doc. 520)\nKane, J.\nJamshid Muhtorov, together with his co-defendant Bakhtiyor Jumaev, is charged\nwith providing material support to a designated terrorist organization, and attempt and\nconspiracy to do the same.  His arrest on a one-way flight to Turkey was originally\nbelieved to be solely the result of warrantless surveillance and physical searches\nauthorized under Title I and III of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), 50\nU.S.C. § 1801-1811, 1821-1829.  Mr. Muhtorov moved to suppress that FISA-acquired\nevidence earlier in these proceedings, which motion I denied based on a determination,\nafter an extensive in camera review of the classified materials submitted to the FISA\nCourt, that there was probable cause to believe the target was an agent as described and\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 35\ntherefore lawfully subject to those searches.  \nThe matter is before me on a renewed Motion to Suppress, precipitated by the\ngovernment’s supplemental disclosure, nearly two years after Mr. Muhtorov’s arrest, that\nsome of the FISA-acquired evidence it intends to use against him in this case was derived\nfrom surveillance conducted under § 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008\n(“FAA”).1 Section 702, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1881a, establishes procedures for the\nwarrantless surveillance of targeted persons overseas “to acquire foreign intelligence\ninformation.” Because communications to and from a target under § 702 are swept up\nwithout reference to who is sending them and without any determination of probable\ncause, the FAA results in the “incidental” interception, collection, and retention of\ncommunications from unconsenting U.S. persons including, in this case, Mr. Muhtorov.   \nJudicial review of § 702 authorizations is narrow, and until the Snowden leaks in\n2013, the American public was led to believe that the government did not query or use\nFAA-acquired surveillance against non-targeted U.S. persons.  See Clapper v. Amnesty\nInt’l, USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (2013).  The belated notice in this case was part of the\nSnowden fallout and the revelation, post-Clapper, that the Executive Branch does, in fact,\nuse FAA-acquired information to investigate U.S. persons for suspected criminal activity,\nand that it intends to use it against Mr. Muhtorov here. \n1  The FAA added Title VII to the FISA statute, which establishes “Additional\n[intelligence gathering] Procedures Regarding Certain Persons Outside the United States.” It is\nintended to sunset on December 31, 2017.  See P.L. 110-261, § 403(b)(1), 122 Stat. 2474, as\namended, appearing in 50 U.S.C. § 1881 note.  \n-2-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 35\nIn his renewed Motion, Mr. Muhtorov moves to suppress all of the FAA-acquired\nevidence in this case and the “fruits thereof” on grounds that § 702's authorization and\nimplementation procedures permit the government to collect and retain the\ncommunications of U.S. persons without a warrant and without probable cause in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.  Alternatively, as an “aggrieved person” entitled to\nchallenge the lawfulness of the acquisitions directly under § 702, he argues the statute\nwas unlawfully applied to him and seeks discovery into the means and methods of the\ngovernment’s FAA surveillance in this case to substantiate that claim.  With the entry of\nthe ACLU as co-counsel for the defense, briefing has emphasized the former, with Mr.\nMuhtorov serving as the Clapper-qualified2 successor to the plaintiffs in that case, who\nwere deemed insufficiently “harmed” by § 702's surveillance procedures to have standing\nto pursue a Fourth Amendment challenge. I find the Clapper argument attenuated by Mr.\nMuhtorov’s status as a criminal defendant – rather than an incidental interceptee generally\n– and that his privacy-related Clapper claim is transformed by that fact.  As a U.S. person\nand a criminal defendant, Mr. Muhtorov is entitled to the full panoply of statutory and\nconstitutional protections afforded under § 702 and the U.S. Constitution.  As a criminal\ndefendant whose communications were captured pursuant to FISA Title I and III\n2  In Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, __ U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (2013), Justice Alito\nwriting for a majority of the Supreme Court held that attorneys, human rights, and media\norganizations lacked article III standing to challenge the constitutionality of § 702 because they\ncould only speculate that their communications had been or would be incidently acquired during\nFAA surveillance of their clients or other targeted persons abroad. With the government’s notice\nin this case, the acquisition of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications is demonstrable and he is\ntherefore “Clapper-qualified” to challenge the law.  \n-3-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 35\nsurveillance targeting an agent of a foreign power, however, these protections are\ncounteracted to a significant extent by FISA and prerogatives long recognized in U.S. law\nregarding the Executive’s primacy in the arena of foreign affairs and national security.  \nMy concern as a trial court judge is with the individual criminal defendants before\nme and their rights to due process and a fair trial.  The constitutional question at issue is\none the Executive and courts have wrestled with since the Supreme Court’s\nacknowledgment in the 1972 Keith3 case of the dilemma invited when warrantless\nnational security intelligence surveillance uncovers evidence of crime.  The question here\nis where – on the continuum between the largely unfettered authority the government\nenjoys in national security matters and foreign intelligence surveillance on the one hand,\nand its constitutionally limited authority to investigate its citizens for crimes – stands Mr.\nMuhtorov.4  It is a particularized inquiry of the most solemn kind. While I am convinced\nthe FAA is susceptible to unconstitutional application as an end-run around the Wiretap\nAct and the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against warrantless or unreasonable\n3  United States v. United States Dist. Court for the Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U.S. 297\n(1972)(known as the Keith case).\n4  I note Mr. Jumaev has filed his own renewed Motion to Suppress and/or for Discovery\n(Doc. 521), insisting that FAA must have informed the government’s investigation and\nindictment of him notwithstanding the government’s disclaimer and the fact that it filed no\nNotice of Intent to Use FAA-Acquired information against him in this case.  Based on the\ngovernment’s representations that it does not intend to use FAA-acquired evidence against him and my ex\nparte review of all of the classified information in this case, I conclude Mr. Jumaev is not an “aggrieved\nperson” authorized under 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e) to move to suppress such evidence or to bring an as-\napplied constitutional challenge to Section 702.  The question of whether the disclaimer deprives Mr.\nJumaev of standing to assert a facial challenge to the FAA under Clapper is an open one, in my view, but\none, given my ruling in this case,  that does not need to be answered. I limit my analysis in this opinion to\nthe constitutional arguments raised by Mr. Muhtorov.\n-4-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 35\nsearches, I am equally convinced that it was not unconstitutionally applied to Mr.\nMuhtorov. Based on my in camera review of the classified and unclassified documents\nmade available to me, the FAA surveillance at issue was narrowly tailored to the\ngovernment’s foreign intelligence-gathering prerogatives. Because I find Section 702 to\nhave been constitutionally applied in this case, the facial challenge to the FAA must be\ndenied.  I will address Mr. Muhtorov’s request for specific, additional discovery and\ndeclassification in a separate order, after conducting one or more prefatory CIPA § 4\nhearings on the subject.5\nI.\nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY.\nJamshid Muhtorov was born in Jizzak, Uzbekistan, when that country was still\nunder communist rule.  He is the oldest of five children.  After graduating from a\ntechnical university, Mr. Muhtorov was offered a position with the Ezgulik Human Rights\nSociety in Uzbekistan, becoming the head of the Jizzak branch in 2003.  \nDuring the course of his work with Human Rights Watch, foreign embassies and\nNGOs, Muhtorov came under the increasing scrutiny of Islam Karimov, the last president\n5  Section 4 of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides that “[t]he\ncourt, upon a sufficient showing, may authorize the United States to delete specified items of\nclassified information from documents to be made available to the defendant through discovery\nunder the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to substitute a summary of the information for\nsuch classified documents, or to substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the classified\ninformation would tend to prove.”  I have, to date, accepted the government’s averred\nclassification assertions as offered.  Through the upcoming § 4 process, I intend to put the\ngovernment through its paces to justify them, and to urge the declassification that was promised\nfor much of the Muhtorov and Jumaev-related discovery in this case.\n-5-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 35\nof Soviet Uzbekistan who became and remains the first president of independent\nUzbekistan.  This scrutiny intensified in May 2005, and in 2006, according to Human\nRights Watch, Mr. Muhtorov was himself threatened and beaten.  With the help of other\nactivists, Mr. Muhtorov fled to Kyrgystan, and then, with his wife and children to the\nUnited States.  \nMr. Muhtorov and his family were admitted to the United States as political\nrefugees in February 2007.  They settled in Colorado.  Mr. Muhtorov has no criminal\nrecord and, until his arrest in January of 2012, had never been arrested.  He is a legal\npermanent resident of the United States.6  \nThe operative Second Superseding Indictment (Doc. 59) charges Mr. Muhtorov\nwith two counts of providing and attempting to provide material support and resources to\nthe Islamic Jihad Union (IJU), and Muhtorov and Jumaev with one count of conspiring to\ncommit that offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B.  If convicted, each faces a\nmaximum term of imprisonment of 15 years.  \nThe allegations in the indictment were initially attributed to information gleaned in\ninvestigations of Mr. Muhtorov’s computer, email accounts, private residence, and\npersonal effects.  See Criminal Compl. (Doc. 1)(and attached Affid. of FBI Special Agent\nHale). When the government formally notified Mr. Muhtorov that it intended to use\nFISA-acquired information against him in the proceedings (Doc. 12), Mr. Muhtorov\n6  See 50 U.S.C. § 1801(i)(defining “United States person” as, among other things, “a\ncitizen of the United States” or “an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence”).\n-6-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 35\nexercised his right as an “aggrieved person” under the statute and moved to suppress. \n(Docs. 14, 125).  I denied that Motion in a written Order issued September 24, 2012 (Doc.\n196), applying the standards set forth at 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e) & (f) and finding the\nsurveillance and physical searches at issue were lawfully authorized and conducted.  I\nspecifically concluded that the attested facts submitted to the FISA Court supported a\nfinding of probable cause to believe the target was an “agent[] of a foreign power,” and\nconcluded that the FISA application and related materials should not, in the interest of\nnational security, be disclosed.  Id. p. 3.  I denied Mr. Jumaev’s related Motion on the\nsame basis.\nOn October 25, 2013, the government filed a Second Notice of Intent to Use FISA-\nacquired Information (Doc. 457), formally notifying Mr. Muhtorov of its intent to use\ninformation obtained or derived from the acquisition of foreign intelligence information\nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, “as amended,” and citing 50\nU.S.C. § 1881a.  Given its timing in the Snowden-Clapper aftermath, the Notice was\nclearly intended to notify Mr. Muhtorov that he was a member of the previously\nundisclosed class of U.S. persons whose international communications had been\nmonitored and acquired incidently to surveillance conducted under § 702 of the FAA.\nViewing the affidavit informing the publicly available Complaint in this case in that light,\nit is clear that FAA surveillance overseas resulted in the acquisition of communications\nlater traced to Muhtorov. See Affid. of FBI Agent Hale (attached as Ex. A to Complaint\n(Doc. 1)).  What was acquired and over what period of time is classified information that\n-7-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 35\nhas not yet been shared with the defense.\nForeign Intelligence Gathering and FISA.\nPresidents since FDR have claimed an inherent constitutional authority to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in national security matters without prior judicial approval.  The\nauthority is grounded in Article II of the Constitution, which charges the Executive to\n“preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”  This authority was\naccorded great deference for many years, until that began to change in the early 1970s.7  \nIn 1972, the Supreme Court took up the question in United States v. United States\nDistrict Court (Keith), 407 U.S. 297 (1972), a case involving the bombing of a CIA\nbuilding and the warrantless surveillance that led to the indictment of the U.S. persons\ninvolved.  Justice Powell, writing for the majority, rejected the government’s assertion of\na blanket national security exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement as\ncodified in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (the\n“Wiretap Act”), concluding the government’s concerns did not justify a departure from\nthe customary Fourth Amendment requirement of judicial pre-approval under the\ncircumstances presented.8  Id. at 323-24.  The Court expressly refused, however, to\n“judge[] the scope of the President’s surveillance power with respect to the activities of\n7  See Fiss, O., “Even in a Time of Terror,” 31 Yale Law & Policy Rev. 1 (2012).\n8  Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (the “Wiretap\nAct”) governs domestic electronic surveillance activities and requires federal, state, and other\nofficials to obtain judicial approval on a specific showing of probable cause before intercepting\n“wire, oral, and electronic” communications such as telephone conversations and e-mails.  \n-8-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 35\nforeign powers, within or without [the U.S.],” id. at 308, leaving that question open.  The\nCourt further recognized potential distinctions between national security surveillance and\n“surveillance of ‘ordinary crime,’” and invited Congress to consider protective standards\nfor the former different from those prescribed in Title III that took these distinctions into\naccount.  Id. at 322-23.  “Different standards,” the Court acknowledged, “may be\ncompatible with the Fourth Amendment if they are reasonable both in relation to the\nlegitimate need of Government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our\ncitizens.”  Id. at 323.\nThe Watergate scandal in 1974 thrust the Executive’s use of electronic\nsurveillance into the public eye.  Revelations during several Senate Committee hearings \nrevealed a host of warrantless privacy infringements of U.S. citizens in the name of\nnational security, including wiretapping of congressional staffers, anti-war protesters, and\ncivil rights activists including Dr. Martin Luther King. After fourteen Senate Reports and\nsignificant debate, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act “to\nregulate the use of electronic surveillance within the United States for foreign intelligence\npurposes.”  See S. Rep. 95-604, p. 7 (1977).  President Carter signed it shortly thereafter.\n92 Stat. 1783, 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.  \nIn constructing a framework for foreign intelligence surveillance that balanced the\nExecutive’s foreign intelligence and security prerogatives with Americans’ privacy\ninterests, Congress defined “electronic surveillance” narrowly to include only foreign\n-9-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 35\nintelligence collection activities that impacted U.S. persons or took place on U.S. soil,9\nand prohibited anyone from engaging in “electronic surveillance under color of law\nexcept as authorized by this Act.” 50 U.S.C. § 1809(a)(emphasis mine).  Congress then\ncreated two specialized foreign intelligence courts – the FISA Court (FISC) and the FISA\nCourt of Review (FISR) – that would approve and review the approval of “electronic\nsurveillance” under the Act.  50 U.S.C. § 1803(a) & (b), discussed in Clapper, 133 S. Ct.\nat 1143.  Surveillance authorization would be given if there was “probable cause to\nbelieve that . . . the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a\nforeign power . . . and each of the facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance\nis directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a\nforeign power”; and if minimization procedures are in place that meet with FISC approval\nunder the standards articulated in the statute.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a).  As will be\n9  See 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(1)-(4)(§ 1801(f)(1)-(4)(defining “electronic surveillance” in\nterms of wire or radio communications targeting a person “in,” acquired “in,” or intended for or\nreceived by someone “in,” the “United States”).  Given that international communications in\n1978 were carried through satellite signals or over transoceanic cables subject to interception\noffshore, Congress understood this language would exempt NSA’s foreign-to-foreign as well as\nmost of its international communications surveillance from regulation, because neither would\nfall within the definition of “electronic surveillance” under the Act: \n“The language of this amendment exempts . . . foreign intelligence gathering . . . .\nif the acquisition does not come within the definition of ‘electronic\nsurveillance’. . . . Specifically this provision is designed to make clear that the\nlegislation does not deal with international signals intelligence activities as\ncurrently engaged in by the National Security Agency and electronic surveillance\nconducted outside the United States.”\nSee United States v. Mohamud, Crim., Case No. 10-cr-475-KI, slip op. at p. 12, 2014 WL\n2866749  (D. Or. June 24, 2014)(quoting S. Rep.

Increasing terrorist\nactivity raised the stakes11 and changes in communications technology brought\nintelligence surveillance intended to remain outside FISA’s purview within its definition\nof domestic surveillance and thus subject to FISA Court review and regulation.12  \nIn 1981, President Reagan issued Executive Order 12333, reaffirming the\nExecutive’s inherent authority to conduct covert operations and collect information on\n10  “Minimization procedures” under FISA are defined as “specific procedures . . .\nadopted by the Attorney General, that are reasonably designed . . . to minimize the acquisition\nand retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning\nunconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain,\nproduce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(h).\n11  The 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran; a series of Libyan and Hezbollah\nbombings, attacks and hostage taking beginning in 1982 and continuing throughout the 80s and\nearly 90s, including the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988; the\n1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York; and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 are\nbut a few examples.\n12  The advent of the internet, for example, meant that foreign communications previously\ntransmitted via satellite or transoceanic cables in 1978 were now carried over fiber optic cables. \nBecause these cables were arguably “wires,” foreign surveillance that would have been excluded\nfrom FISA regulation in 1978 was rendered potentially unlawful due merely to a change in\ntechnology, rather than any intentional decision by Congress.  See Modernization of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act: Hearing before the S. Sel. Comm. on Intel., 110th th Cong., 1st Sess.\n(2007) at pp. 9-19 (testimony of the Director of National Intelligence).  \n-11-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 35\n“foreign powers, organizations, persons, and their agents” without reference to FISA,  and\nspecifically authorizing “elements of the intelligence community . . . to collect retain, or\ndisseminate information concerning United States persons.”  EO 12333, Parts 2.2, 2.3.13 \nIn 1995 and 1998, Congress amended FISA directly, first to include physical searches, 50\nU.S.C. §§ 1821-29, and then the installation and use of pen register and trap and trace\ndevices, §§ 1841-46, “for foreign intelligence purposes.” \nThen in 2001, foreign terrorists carried out the coordinated 9/11 attacks on New\nYork City and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 people on American soil.  Within weeks,\nboth President George W. Bush and Congress had acted to expand Executive surveillance\nauthority and facilitate more effective coordination between the intelligence community\nand federal law enforcement agencies.  In October 2001, Congress passed the USA\nPATRIOT ACT,14 sweeping legislation that modified multiple existing laws and\nenhanced the government’s law enforcement authority as it related to investigating and\nprosecuting terrorism.15  Among other things, the PATRIOT ACT revised FISA § 104's\n13  EO 12333's complete text appears at 46 Fed.

Responding to a series of court cases and intelligence agency\npolicies that had erected a “Wall” between foreign intelligence and criminal\ninvestigations, the ACT authorizing FISA applications on a certification that foreign\nintelligence gathering was a “significant,” rather than “primary” purpose of the\nsurveillance sought.  Compare 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6)(B) (2008) with 50 U.S.C. §\n1804(a)(7)(B) (2000)(change discussed at length in United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d\n102, 122-23 (2d Cir. 2010)).  President Bush, meanwhile, responded to the 9/11 attacks\nby authorizing the NSA to conduct warrantless wiretapping of telephone and e-mail\ncommunications in the United States outside the purview of FISC entirely, as long as one\nparty to a communication was located outside the United States and a participant in “the\ncall was reasonably believed to be a member or agent of Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist\norganization.” See Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1143-44.  Until 2005, neither the public nor\nmost members of Congress were aware the President’s Terrorist Surveillance Program\n(TSP) existed.\nPresident Bush’s confirmation in December 2005 that the NSA had been\nconducting warrantless electronic surveillance of U.S. persons without even FISA Court\napproval prompted Congress, once again, to conduct a “vigorous inquiry” into the\nExecutive’s secret surveillance activities. See S. Rep. No. 110-209, 1st Sess. 1 (2007). \nWith all parties in agreement that FISA required updating, Congress set to work.  See\nModernization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: Hearing before the H.\n-13-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 35\nPermanent Select Comm. on Intel., 109th Cong., 2d Sess. (2006).16\nThe PAA and Elimination of the “Foreign Agent” Probable Cause Requirment\nAs a result of these efforts, Congress enacted the Protect America Act (“PAA”) in\nAugust 2007, a temporary measure that brought the Executive’s TSP authority into the\nFISA fold.  Codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1805a, b & c, the PAA permitted the Director of\nNational Intelligence and the Attorney General to authorize the acquisition of foreign\nintelligence information “concerning persons reasonably believed to be located outside\nthe United State” without reference to their status as foreign agents, limited solely by the\nestablishment of targeting and minimization procedures to “preserve the privacy interests\n16  During hearings, Congress heard testimony on the ways the advancement of\ncommunications technology since 1978 had created unforeseen consequences under FISA.\nTransmission over an integrated global communications grid blurred the distinction between \ndomestic and offshore acquisition.  Domestic communications between neighbors in Peoria\ncould travel around the world and be intercepted abroad.  Foreign-to-foreign communications\nthat were previously beyond FISA’s reach could be intercepted in the United States. \n[As a communication travels the global network,] NSA may \nhave multiple opportunities to intercept it as it moves and changes medium.  As\nlong as a communication is otherwise lawfully targeted, we should be indifferent\nto where the intercept is achieved.  Signals intelligence is a difficult art and\nscience . . . . Intercept of a particular communication . . . is always probabilistic,\nnot deterministic [and] [n] o coverage is guaranteed.\nFISA for the 21st Century: Hg. before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d Sess.\n(2006)(statement of NSA Director General Michael V. Hayden).  The necessary fix, Congress\nwas told, was a “technology-neutral” framework for surveillance of foreign targets – focused not\non “how a communication travels or where it is intercepted,” but on “who is the subject of the\nsurveillance, which really is the critical issue for civil liberties purposes.”  FISA Modernization\nHg. at 46 (statement of Asst. Atty Gen. Kenneth L. Wainstein).  With these changes, it was\nimplied, the original balance between strictly “foreign” foreign intelligence gathering and\nforeign intelligence gathering that impacted Americans struck by FISA in 1978 could be\nreconstituted, and secret programs like TSP could be brought to light and integrated into the\nFISA framework.\n-14-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 35\nof persons in the United States.”  S. Rep. No. 209, 110th Cong. 1st Sess. at 5-6.  The PAA\nwas revised and incorporated into FISA by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, becoming\n§ 702 of a new FISATitle VII.  \nSection 702, like the PAA before it, authorizes the Attorney General and the\nDirector of National Intelligence to authorize jointly, “for a period of up to 1 year,” the\n“targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to\nacquire foreign intelligence information.”  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a).  Like the PAA, § 702\npermits the government to intercept all communications to and from the target, including\nthose of U.S. persons, without demonstrating probable cause that either is a foreign power\nor the agent of a foreign power, and without identifying the facilities or places where the\nelectronic surveillance will occur.  FAA procedure simply requires the Attorney General,\nin consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, to select a target and adopt\nguidelines the Attorney General certifies will “ensure” compliance with appropriate\ntargeting and minimization procedures, as well as the limitations on § 702 surveillance\nauthority set forth in § 1881a(b).  See § 1881a(f)&(g).  If the FISC finds the AG’s\ncertifications, targeting, and minimization procedures are “consistent with [the FAA’s\nrequirements] and with the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States,” it\n“shall” enter an order approving the certification and use of the procedures for the\nacquisition. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i).  \nSection 702's limitations are significant, but largely conclusory and “riddled with\nloopholes.”  An acquisition under § 702(a) may not “intentionally” target a person\n-15-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 35\n“known” at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States (§ 1881a(b)(1)), or\n“intentionally target” a person “reasonably believed to be located outside the United\nStates” if the “purpose” of such acquisition is to target a “particular, known person\nreasonably believed to be in the United States.” § 1881a(b)(2). Also, acquisitions must be\n“conducted in a manner consistent with the fourth amendment to the Constitution.”  §\n1881a(b)(5).  But the government is the sole arbiter of its “knowledge,” “intent,”\n“purposes,” and “conduct.”17  The government can continue “incidently” acquiring a\nperson’s communications under § 702 even after such reveals evidence of a crime, as long\nas the government avoids learning that the person is a U.S. person or located in the United\nStates.  It can avoid seeking Title I or Title III authority to target the person directly by\nsimply declining to call that person a “target.”  It can say it is “conducting” this\nsurveillance consistently with the fourth amendment, but § 702 provides no mechanism\nfor FISC to assess whether that is the case.  For an excellent discussion of the FAA’s\nweaknesses and prescriptions for remedying them, see T. Anderson, “Toward\nInstitutional Reform of Intelligence Surveillance: A Proposal to Amend the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act,” 8 Harv. Law & Policy Rev. 413 (Summer 2014).  \n17  Compliance with § 702(b) limitations and with the Attorney General’s proffered\ntargeting and minimization procedures is self-monitored and self-executing under the FAA, as\njudicial review is limited to the initial authorization and any reauthorizations sought by\namendment.   See § 1881a(i).  The FAA requires that the Attorney General and Director of\nNational Intelligence conduct a “semi-annual assessment” of compliance with the targeting and\nminimization procedures of a particular surveillance authorization, § 1881a(l), but other than\nsubmitting that assessment to FISC and to congressional intelligence and judiciary committees,\nthe FAA requires no action on the assessment and no judicial review on the part of FISC.\n-16-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 35\nFISA and Law Enforcement.\nOur concern in this case, of course, is the confluence of FISA and law\nenforcement, i.e., what happens when FISA surveillance results in the acquisition of\nevidence of a crime.  It is clear that FISA surveillance is more than simply foreign\nintelligence gathering, and that its purpose since its inception has been the discovery and\ninvestigation of foreign intelligence crimes.  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 725\n(Foreign Int. Surv. Ct. Rev. 2002).  U.S. persons may be authorized targets, and\nsurveillance may be part of an investigative process designed to protect against the\ncommission of serious crimes such as espionage, sabotage, assassination, kidnaping, and\nterrorist acts committed by or on behalf of foreign powers.  Id. (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-\n701, at 10-11 (1978)).  The question has always been where these two functions merge,\ni.e., where FISA-acquired electronic surveillance information, which is acquired without a\nwarrant under the Wiretap Act, is used against an U.S. person who would otherwise enjoy\nthe protections of that Act. \nBefore the enactment of the FAA, case law developed permitting the use of FISA-\nacquired evidence against U.S. persons in criminal prosecutions as long as there was\nprobable cause to believe those persons were “foreign powers” or “agents of a foreign\npower” (50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2)) and the surveillance was properly conducted “to acquire\nforeign intelligence information.”  50 U.S.C. § 1802(a)(1).  E.g. United States v. Pelton,\n835 F.2d 1067, 1074-76 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1010 (1988)(as long as the\npurpose of FISA surveillance is foreign intelligence gathering, that purpose is not\n-17-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 35\nchanged merely because government anticipates using fruits of FISA surveillance in\ncriminal prosecution).  The purpose of the surveillance cannot be a ruse.  See United\nStates v. Johnson, 952 F.2d 656, 572 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 816\n(1992)(government cannot use FISA as an “end-run around the Fourth Amendment’s\nprohibition of warrantless searches” by drumming up a foreign intelligence purpose for\nordinary criminal investigation); United States v. Troung Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 916\n(4th Cir. 1980)(targets must “receive the protection of the warrant requirement if the\ngovernment is primarily attempting to put together a criminal prosecution.”) But unless\nsurveillance is conducted “solely” for law enforcement purposes, the Fourth Amendment\nunder Keith is flexible enough to justify the use of FISA-acquired evidence in criminal\nprosecutions even without a Title III warrant.  See  U.S. v. Duka, 671 F.3d 329, 345 (3d\nCir. 2011)(evidence derived from a reasonable search is admissible in a criminal trial);\nAbu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 12 (Fourth Amendment does not require the government to\nidentify a primary purpose or limit its ability to secure a warrant to satisfaction of the\nstandards for that purpose; rather, the government may secure a warrant under the\nprobable cause standards applicable to any purpose that it pursues in good faith).\nUnder the FAA, § 702 does away with the § 105's probable cause requirement,\npermitting the government to target persons based solely on their physical presence\noutside the United States, and to intercept communications to and from those persons, as\nlong as the surveillance was conducted “to acquire foreign intelligence information.” \n§ 1881a(a).  Mr. Muhtorov contends this change distinguishes the case law allowing the\n-18-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 35\nuse of FISA-acquired evidence in criminal prosecutions, and renders the use of FAA-\nacquisitions against U.S. persons in criminal prosecutions unconstitutional.\nII.\nDISCUSSION.\nMr. Muhtorov contends the fruits of the government’s § 702 surveillance must be\nsuppressed because the statute that authorized the surveillance is unconstitutional.  He\nargues the FAA violates the Fourth Amendment by authorizing surveillance that\ncontravenes the warrant clause and, independently, surveillance that is unreasonable.  He\nalso argues the FAA violates Article III by requiring judges to issue advisory opinions in\nthe absence of a case or controversy, citing my opinion in United States v. Smith18 in\nsupport.  \nThe FAA and Article III’s Case or Controversy Requirement\nI pause briefly to address Mr. Muhtorov’s assertion that the FAA is\nunconstitutional because it violates Article III’s “case or controversy” requirement.  His\nargument is novel and elegant, but I will not be the first to adopt it.  Plainly stated,\nMuhtorov argues the FAA assigns to the FISA Court a role “fundamentally incompatible\nwith the case-or-controversy requirement” because it compels FISC to “evaluate in a\nvacuum whether proposed targeting and minimization procedures comply with the statute\n18  United States v. Smith, 686 F. Supp. 847 (D. Colo. 1988)(declaring Sentencing Reform\nAct of 1986 unconstitutional, in part, because role played by Article III judges on Sentencing\nCommission violated principles of separation of powers).  \n-19-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 35\nand the Constitution” without any particularized facts or context.  Mot. (Doc. 520) at 45. \nThe authority he cites for his proposition, however, is either inapposite,19 or\ndistinguishable,20 and none applies the concept in the context of the “neutral magistrate”\nor other arbiter of search authorizations or warrants under the Fourth Amendment.\nMr. Muhtorov’s strongest argument is that courts that have rejected Article III\nchallenges to the traditional FISA process have done so because the FISC’s job is a\nparticularized one – i.e. that under 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a) and (b), FISC considers concrete\nfacts about a specific person to be monitored and the facilities to be targeted.  Citing U.S.\n19  Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 97 (1968)(addressing case in controversy requirement in\ncontext of standing analysis for taxpayer suit challenging validity of federal spending on\ntextbooks); Citizens Concerned for Separation of Church & State v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 628\nF.2d 1289, 1295 (10th Cir. 1980)(using case or controversy requirement as source for standing\nanalysis, finding citizens lacked standing to bring First Amendment challenge to City’s creche\ndisplay because there was no showing of causal connection between the creche display and any\ninjury in fact to plaintiff); In re Summers, 325 U.S. 227, 241 (1937)(holding that a claim of a\npresent right to admission to state bar association and denial of that right is a case or controversy\nthat may be reviewed under Article III when federal questions are raised).  The citation to my\nopinion in Smith is more interesting, because although my ruling there passed on a completely\ndifferent aspect of the separation of powers doctrine, I observed that article III judges\n“‘[d]ischarging tasks other than the deciding of cases and controversies’” would involve them in\nthe process of policy and thereby “‘weaken confidence in the disinterestedness of their\njudicatory functions.’” 686 F. Supp. at 855 (quoting In re Sealed Cases, 838 F.2d 476, 512 (D.C.\nCir. 1988). The point is correct, in my view, but not particularly germane.  If the concern is that\nFISC’s participation in § 702 authorizations undermines the perceived impartiality or\ndetachment of the judiciary from law enforcement, it is of a kind with concerns over judges\nparticipation in secret or ex parte proceedings of all types, and wiretap authorizations generally.\n20    See New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 768 (1982)(addressing the need to focus on\n“flesh-and-blood” applications of fact to law in context of First Amendment overbreadth\nchallenge to child pornography statute); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 239\n(1937)(construing Declaratory Judgment Act’s “actual controversy” requirement in context of\nArticle III’s limitation of judicial power to “‘cases’ and ‘controversies,’” holding the term\n“‘controversies,’ if distinguishable at all from ‘cases,’ is so in that it is less comprehensive than\nthe latter, and includes only suits of a civil nature”).\n-20-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 35\nv.

In Megahey, defendants argued that FISC was not constitutionally authorized\nunder Article III because FISA required it to issue orders on an ex parte basis without any\nadversarial proceedings.  The district court rejected the argument, stating \nApplications for electronic surveillance submitted to FISC pursuant to FISA\ninvolve concrete questions respecting the application of the Act and are in a\nform such that a judge is capable of acting on them, much as he might\notherwise act on an ex parte application for a warrant. In the case of each\napplication, the FISC judge is statutorily obliged to ensure that each statutory prerequisite\nis met by the application before he may enter a surveillance order. The FISC judge who is\nfaced with a surveillance application is not faced with an abstract issue of law or called\nupon to issue an advisory opinion, but is, instead, called upon to ensure that the\nindividuals who are targeted do not have their privacy interests invaded, except in\ncompliance with the detailed requirements of the statute.\n553 F. Supp. 1180 at 1197.  \nThat the FAA altered this analysis is undeniable.  The “concrete questions” and\n“individual targets” contemplated by traditional FISA authorization requests have been \nexcused in authorization requests under the FAA.  Moreover, the “incidental interceptees”\nwith whom we are concerned are nameless, faceless, and transient in the context of § 702\nsurveillance, and their privacy interests are evaluated solely in the context of the certified\ntargeting and minimization procedures FISC is asked to approve.  \nThe government dismisses this distinction, arguing FAA authorization approval is\nmore similar to traditional FISA approval than different, and constitutionally not unlike\nother statutory schemes in which courts assess the reasonableness of standards and\n-21-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 35\nprocedures for conducting searches or surveillance consistently with Article III.

Accordingly to the government, FISC’s job of\nanalyzing the reasonableness of electronic surveillance by weighing national security\ninterests against the privacy interests of potential subjects is a “traditional judicial\nfunction,” citing Halperin v. Kissinger, 606 F.2d 1192, 1201 n.59 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and is\nnot rendered otherwise by the fact that the potential subjects are not identified with\nparticularity. \nI do not dismiss the distinction so easily.  FISC’s job under the FAA is\nsubstantively different than it is under traditional FISA and under any of the other\nexamples of “traditional judicial function” the government cites.  Under the FAA,\nincidental interceptees are part of the surveillance contemplated, but no particularized\ninformation about them or their communications practices is presented to FISC for\nconsideration.  Each of the scenarios cited by the government is different: There would\nhave been no “case or controversy” in Tortorello without Arthur Tortorello, and no “case\nor controversy” in Camara without Roland Camara.  \n-22-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 35\nFISC’s role in approving the surveillance of individual foreign powers or agents\nunder traditional FISA is qualitatively different from its role in approving the surveillance\nand incidental acquisition of strangers’ communications under the FAA. Whether that\nrole offends Article III sufficiently to invalidate § 702 as a tool for gathering foreign\nintelligence information is one I leave to a higher court.21  For purposes of the case before\nme, my judgment is that it does not.\nThe FAA’s Validity Under the Fourth Amendment.\nWhile FISA authorizes the government to conduct relatively narrow surveillance\nof individuals reasonably believed to be “foreign agents” or “foreign powers,” the FAA\npermits the government to monitor any person, and that person’s contacts, without\nreference to his foreign status or agency.  By permitting the government to acquire\n“essentially any communication that originates or terminates outside the United States,”\n21 I note that during the course of briefing in this case, Judge King in the District of\nOregon issued his opinion in United States v. Mohamud, 2014 WL 2866749 (2014), upholding\nthe FAA and the government’s disclosure that it had used FAA-acquired evidence to secure the\nconviction of a U.S. person.  Defendant’s arguments in Mohamud, discussed further infra,\nincluded an Article III challenge similar to Mr. Muhtorov’s here.  While I agree with several of\nJudge King’s legal conclusions in Mohamud, I find his analysis of defendant’s “case or\ncontroversy” arguments unpersuasive.  Judge King spent most of his discussion couching\ndefendant’s arguments in terms of a separation of powers challenge, which he contends has been\nput to rest by Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989). Id. at *10-11. As set forth in n. 19,\nsupra, I find the separation of powers analysis inapposite to the “case or controversy” argument\nraised.  Judge King’s further discussion equates FISC’s role in FAA surveillance authorizations\nto the “neutral and detached” review conducted by magistrates under the Wiretap Act, citing\nKeith.  Id. at *11.  In so doing, Judge King did not address the fundamental differences between\nwiretap authorization reviews conducted in criminal cases and traditional FISA on the one hand,\nand the FAA on the other.  As a result, I do not believe Mohamud moves the ball forward on this\nissue.\n-23-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 35\nMr. Muhtorov contends the FAA violates both the Fourth Amendment’s warrant clause\nand its ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.  Mot. Suppress (Doc. 520) at 21.  \nThe Fourth Amendment’s Warrant Requirement\nThe Fourth Amendment states:\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,\nand no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or\naffirmation, and particularly describing the places to be searched, and the\npersons or things to be seized.\nThe modern Supreme Court has done away with an interpretation of the Fourth\nAmendment that requires a warrant, a probable cause determination, “‘[]or, indeed, any\nmeasure of individualized suspicion,” in every circumstance, before a search may be\nlawful.  Mohamud, 2014 WL 2866749 at *12 (quoting Nat’l Treasury Emp. Union v. Von\nRaab, 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989)(holding suspicionless drug-testing of certain United\nStates Custom Service employees not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment)).  The\nwarrant requirement does not apply to activities of the United States directed against\naliens in a foreign territory, United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 267\n(1990)(search of the Mexican residences of a Mexican citizen), and does not apply to\neven U.S. persons if the government establishes a defensible “special need” to dispense\nwith it.  See e.g. Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 873 (1987)(exception to Fourth\nAmendment’s warrant requirement “when special needs, beyond the normal need for law\nenforcement, makes the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.”)).  \nCourts have combined these concepts to carve out a “foreign intelligence\n-24-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 35\nexception” to the warrant requirement,22 which Mr. Muhtorov urges me to reject.23  I find\nthe special need/foreign intelligence exception argument somewhat academic and\nlimiting, because the standard ultimately is one of reasonableness, and it is on that\nstandard that the constitutionality of § 702's warrantless surveillance authorization must\nbe decided.  See Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 852 n.3 (2006)(declining to address\nwhether California’s parole search condition was justified “special need” under Griffin\nbecause determination that condition was reasonable rendered examination unnecessary).  \nOn its face, § 702 surveillance targets individuals outside the United States “to\nacquire foreign intelligence information.”  The reasonabless of that targeting, without a\nwarrant, is not the essence of our inquiry.  See In re Directives [redacted text] Pursuant to\nSection 105B of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 551 F.3d 1004, 1012 (For.\nIntel. Surv. Ct. Rev. 2008)(Even if a foreign intelligence exception applies in a given\ncase, “governmental action intruding on the individual privacy interest [of U.S. persons]\nmust comport with the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness requirement.”).  Our concern\nis with the axiomatic corollary of that targeting, i.e., that U.S. persons’ communications\nwith the target are perforce acquired as part of that targeted surveillance, and may be used\n22  See Duka, 671 F.3d at 341 (stating “courts have concluded that the important national\ninterest in foreign intelligence gathering justifies electronic surveillance without prior judicial\nreview, creating a sort of ‘foreign intelligence exception’ to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant\nrequirement,” and collecting cases).\n23  Mot. Suppress (Doc. 520, at 27, 30)(there is no “special needs” exception to the\nwarrant requirement for foreign intelligence and “not basis to conclude” the requirement is\nunworkable here).  \n-25-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 35\nagainst them in criminal investigations on American soil without any reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause determination having been made as to them.\nReasonableness.\nThe touchstone of constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment is\nreasonableness.  It is a fluctuating rather than fixed standard.  It depends not only on an\nanalysis of the discrete facts incident to a finding of probable cause (and, for that matter,\nthe search and/or seizure itself), but also the intent and purpose of the established laws of\nthe United States.  Because the test is one of reasonableness, the panoply of relevant\nfactors must be considered.  In the instant case, the charges against Mr. Muhtorov are\npremised in the constitutional requirement that the Executive has broad powers to protect\nthe United States against foreign threats.  What may be unreasonable in a purely domestic\nmatter may, on balance, be considered reasonable in the context of the security of the\nnation in dealing with foreign powers and organizations that pose a threat.  “It must be\nremembered that what the Constitution forbids is not all searches and seizures, but\nunreasonable searches and seizures.”  Elkins v. Unites States, 364 U.S. 206, 222 (1960).\nTo analyze whether a government search is reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment, the court examines the totality of the circumstances.  Samson v. California,\n547 U.S. 843, 848 (2006).  The court weighs “the promotion of legitimate governmental\ninterests against the degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual’s privacy.”\nMaryland v. King, __ U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 1958, 1970 (2013)(internal citations and\nquotations omitted).  Under this standard, the modern Supreme Court has approved\n-26-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 35\nstatutory schemes requiring arrestees to submit to buccal swab DNA testing solely as a\npolice booking procedure, see id., and parolees to agree in writing to be subject to\nsuspicionless searches at any time, day or night.  Samson, 547 U.S. at 846 (Thomas, J.)\nMr. Muhtorov argues that in the context of electronic surveillance, reasonableness\nrequires that eavesdropping be “precise and discriminate” and “carefully circumscribed so\nas to prevent unauthorized invasions of privacy.”  Mot. (Doc. 520) at 34 (citing Berger v.\nState of New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967) and United States v. Bobo, 477 F.2d 974, 980 (4th\nCir. 1973)).  He urges me to look to traditional FISA and Title III as measures of the \nreasonableness for electronic surveillance, arguing FAA’s approval scheme permitting the\ngeneralized acquisition of U.S. persons’ communications without any particularized\nshowing or demonstration of cause is a bridge too far.  Id.  I do not disagree, but find\nthere is more to the balance than that.  The fact traditional FISA surveillance requires a\nparticularized demonstration of probable cause and is constitutional does not mean that\nFAA surveillance is unconstitutional because it does not.  The question is the degree of\nthe intrusion, weighed against the government’s legitimate interest in acquiring foreign \nintelligence information to protect against the commission of serious crimes such as\nespionage and terrorist acts committed by or on behalf of foreign powers.  In my view,\nthe FAA passes the Fourth Amendment test.\nPrivacy Interest.\nAs an initial matter, I consider Mr. Muhtorov’s privacy interests.  Under § 702, the\nintrusion on an individual’s privacy is as an incidental third party who is a participant in\n-27-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 35\nintercepted communications with a target overseas.  The government contends defendants\nhave little or “severely diminished” expectations of privacy in their communications with\nnon-U.S. persons overseas, see Unclassified Br. (Doc. 559) at 59-61, & n. 37, based\nsimply on the fact that those persons could be targets for surveillance both by the U.S.\ngovernment and by other foreign governments or private interest.  While I could never\nadopt the government’s cynical view of the First and Fourth Amendment, it is true that\nexpectations of privacy are diminished the more information one puts out into the ether,\nespecially the ether of the global telecommunications network.\nFourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized a third-party doctrine, i.e., a\ndiminishment or loss of a person’s privacy interests where he reveals information to a\nthird party, even in confidence.  See United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 444\n(1976)(bank records); Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979)(use of a pen register by\ntelephone company does not constitute a search within meaning of Fourth Amendment\nbecause person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in numbers dialed on his phone). \nThe concept has been held to apply to electronic communications, where “a person’s\nreasonable expectation of privacy may be diminished in transmissions over the Internet or\ne-mail that have already arrived at the recipient .”  United Sates v. Heckenkamp, 482 F.3d\n1142, 1146 (9th Cir. 2007).  While Mr. Muhtorov and others have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the content of their communications generally, those interests\nare at least somewhat diminished when transmitted to a third party over the internet. \nWeighing Privacy and National Security Interests to Assess Reasonableness.  \n-28-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 35\nThe intrusion into U.S. persons’ legitimate privacy interests under § 702 is less\nthan the generalized “vacuum-cleaner-style mass collection of virtually every person’s\ninternational communications” of which Mr. Muhtorov, in his role as Clapper-qualified\nantagoniste, complains.  Collection must be demonstrably intertwined with the\ngovernment’s efforts to “acquire foreign intelligence information,”24 § 1881a(a), and may\nnot “intentionally target any person known at the time of the acquisition to be located in\nthe United States.”  § 1881a(b)(1).  Approval hinges on findings that “foreign intelligence\ninformation” gathering is a “significant purpose” of the surveillance, and limitations\nagainst abusing the § 702 surveillance process to effectively target Americans will be\nobserved.  \nMore importantly, as was posited at the beginning of this opinion, Mr. Muhtorov’s\nconcern is less with the incidental acquisition of his communications by national\nintelligence agencies during the course of otherwise lawful foreign intelligence gathering,\nbut in the retention and use of those communications by federal law enforcement in\ncriminal proceedings against him in a court of law.  FISA clearly contemplates that\nintelligence gathering and law enforcement “tend to merge” in the area of terrorism\ndetection and prevention.  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 725 (citing S. Rep. 95-701\n24  “Foreign intelligence information” is defined under FISA as information that “relates\nto, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to, the ability of the United States to\nprotect against . . . an actual or potential attack . . . sabotage, international terrorism, or the\ninternational proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . . . , or clandestine intelligence\nactivities.”  § 1801(e)(1).  It is also information with respect to a foreign power . . . that relates\nto, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to . . . the national defense or the\nsecurity of the United States.”  § 1801(e)(2).\n-29-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 35\n(1978)).  The government’s interest in using intelligence information to detect and\nprevent criminal acts of terrorism, and ultimately to punish their perpetrators, is a\nlegitimate governmental interest against which individual FAA privacy intrusions must be\nweighed.\nRelevant to balancing of FAA interceptees’ privacy interests against the\ngovernment’s interest in detecting and preventing acts of terrorism, is the fact that the\ngovernment’s use of FAA-acquired communications is carefully controlled under FISA.\nSee id., 310 F.3d at 740-41.  Minimization procedures must be adopted by the Attorney\nGeneral for every application under the FAA, see § 1881a(e), and must be designed to\n“minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly\navailable information concerning unconsenting United States persons.”  50 U.S.C. §\n1801(h)(1).  Procedures must provide for the weeding out of information that is not\nforeign intelligence information, and the protection of it from dissemination in any\nmanner that identifies a United States person without his consent. § 1801(h)(2). \nAdditional minimization procedures must be established for the retention and\ndissemination to law enforcement of information that is evidence of a crime, §\n1801(h)(3), and provide for how communications to which a United States person is a\nparty may be disclosed, disseminated, or used, and provide time limits for retention.\n§ 1801(h)(4).  \nMr. Muhtorov argues that § 702's minimization procedures are inadequate (and the\napproval scheme therefore constitutionally unreasonable) because they allow the\n-30-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 35\ngovernment to maintain a database of incidently collected information and query it for\nlaw enforcement purposes later.  These “backdoor searches,” Muhtorov concludes,\nrequire a warrant and render the FAA approval scheme unconstitutional.  I disagree. \nAccessing stored records in a database legitimately acquired is not a search in the context\nof the Fourth Amendment because there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in that\ninformation.  Evidence obtained legally by one police agency may be shared with similar\nagencies without the need for obtaining a warrant, even if sought to be used for an\nentirely different purpose.  This principle applies to fingerprint databases and has also\nbeen applied in the foreign intelligence context in Jabara v. Webster, 691 F.2d 272, 277-\n79 (6th Cir. 1982).    \nApplying these standards to the suspicionless incidental acquisition of U.S.\npersons’ communications contemplated under the FAA, I cannot conclude that the FAA’s\napproval procedures are per se constitutionally infirm.  These acquisitions must be\ntailored to the very serious  purpose of foreign intelligence gathering, as defined in the\nAct, and may not be used to target U.S. persons as an end-run around Title III. \nMinimization procedures must weed out acquisitions that are unrelated to foreign\nintelligence gathering, and inform the retention, querying, and dissemination of those\nacquisitions for law enforcement purposes in a manner that is consistent with the\nlimitations in § 1881a(b).  I note this conclusion is consistent with Judge King’s in\nMohamud (2014 WL 2866749 at *27), the only other decision to date to have addressed\nthe specific Fourth Amendment challenge to the FAA presented here.  \n-31-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 35\nThat I do not find the FAA unconstitutional on its face does not per force mean\nthat it was constitutionally applied to Mr. Muhtorov. As I have already observed, § 702's\nauthorization procedures are “riddled” with loopholes and there is no judicial oversight of\ntheir execution over time.  Any acquisition, retention, dissemination, or use of his\nelectronic communications that abused one of these loopholes or exceeded FISC’s\nauthorizations in this case would be unlawful.  Accordingly, I proceed to consider the\nconstitutionality of the specific § 702 acquisitions of Mr. Muhtorov’s electronic\ncommunications in this case.\nAcquisition of § 702 Materials in this Case.  \nOther than the specific timeline of the § 702 acquisitions involving Mr. Muhtorov,\nthe relevant facts in this case are straightforward and minimally classified.  Nearly all are\nrecited in the Affidavit of Special Agent Hale of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a\npublic document filed with the court in support of the criminal complaint (Doc.1, filed\n01/19/12).  The problem with Agent Hale’s factual recitation is that it elides any express\ndistinction between the facts gathered as a result of Title I (electronic) and Title III\n(physical) searches on the one hand, and Title VII (FAA-acquired) information on the\nother.  \nThe Islamic Jihad Union (IJU) is an extremist organization that splintered from the\nIslamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) in the early 2000s.  The IJU adheres to an\nanti-Western ideology, opposes secular rule in Uzbekistan, and seeks to replace the\ncurrent regime with a government based on Islamic law.  The IJU first conducted attacks\n-32-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 35\nin April, 2004, targeting a popular bazaar and police at several roadway checkpoints. \nThese attacks killed approximately 47 people, including 33 terrorists, some of whom were\nsuicide bombers. The IJU claimed responsibility for these attacks on multiple militant\nIslamic websites and denounced the leadership of Uzbekistan.  In July, 2004, the IJU\nconducted simultaneous suicide bombings of the United States and Israeli Embassies in\nUzbekistan as well as the Uzbekistani Prosecutor General’s Office in Tashkent,\nUzbekistan.  Claiming responsibility for these attacks, the IJU stated that its martyrdom\noperations would continue.  The IJU also claimed the attacks were committed in support\nof its Palestinian, Iraqi and Afghan brothers in a global insurgency.\nIn September, 2007, German authorities arrested three IJU operatives, thus\ndisrupting a plot against unidentified U.S. or Western facilities in Germany.  The IJU\noperatives had available 700 kilograms of hydrogen peroxide and an explosives precursor\nsufficient in raw material to make the equivalent of about 1200 pounds of TNT.  The IJU\nclaimed responsibility for the foiled plot.  The IJU has also claimed responsibility for\nattacks targeting coalition forces in Afghanistan in 2008 including a March suicide attack\nagainst a U.S. military post that was allegedly carried out by a German-born Turk.\nIn April, 2009, Turkish authorities seized weapons and detained extremists with\nties to the IJU.  The IJU also claimed responsibility for a May 2009 attack in Uzbekistan\nand numerous attacks in Afghanistan against coalition forces.  At all times relevant to the\ncharges against Mr. Muhtorov, the IJU was designated a terrorist organization by the\nSecretary of State, and has been so designated since June 12, 2005, under the name\n-33-\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 885   Filed 11/19/15   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 35\nIslamic Jihad Group.25  \nAs has already been disclosed, the FISA application at issue in this case was based\nin part on FAA surveillance and collection.  Mr. Muhtorov contends the “incidental”\nacquisition of his communications and their subsequent retention, querying, and use in\ncriminal proceedings brought against him, was unreasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.  I have already reviewed the FISA Court’s Title I and Title III approvals and\nconcluded the searches and surveillance conducted under those approvals was lawfully\nauthorized and conducted.  I have since performed an exhaustive in camera and ex parte\nreview of all relevant additional classified materials provided to me by the government,\nincluding supplemental classified materials prepared at my request.  I conclude on the\nrecord before me that a proper and supported application was filed, and that the targeting\nand minimization procedures forwarded were tailored to the government’s legitimate\nforeign intelligence purposes and took into account the privacy interests of individuals\nwhose communications would be incidently acquired.  Mr. Muhtorov’s Motion to\nSuppress Evidence Obtained or Derived under § 702 (Doc. 520) is DENIED.  Because I\nfind all legal criteria were met by the government to establish that the searches and\nsurveillance at issue were lawfully authorized and conducted, there is no need to consider\nthe “good faith” alternative basis for denying the Motion to Suppress.\n25 Notification of its designation appears at 70 Fed. Reg. 35332-01 (June 17, 2005)\nand was amended to include the name “Islamic Jihad Union” on April 29, 2008,\npublished in the 73 F.

Accordingly, this\nmatter will be set for a discovery conference, to be attended by the government and the\ndefense, at which time the government should be prepared to address the CIPA § 4\nhearing and process for moving toward the declassification of any Brady and related\ninformation material to the defense in this case.  The conference will be conducted before\na court reporter and under conditions that will allow it to be conducted as a closed\nhearing, should the need arise.  \nDated November 19, 2015\ns/John L.

INTRODUCTION \nJosef  K.,  the  tragic  protagonist  in  Franz  Kafka’s  The  Trial,  was  arrested  by \ntwo  agents  “one  fine  morning”  and  spent  a  nightmarish  year  waiting  to  stand  trial. \nHe  had  no  idea  of  the  charges  against  him  or  what  secret  court  authorized  the \nprocess  that  led  to  his  arrest.  One  year  later,  two  agents  again  came  for  the \nunknowing  Josef  K.  and  took  him  to  a  quarry  outside  of  town.  There,  he  was \nexecuted. \nSurely,  Josef  K.  would  empathize  with  the  not  too  dissimilar  circumstances \nconfronting  Defendant  Bakhtiyor  Jumaev.  Although  Mr.  Jumaev  knows  he  has \nbeen  charged  with  providing  material  support  to  a  designated  terrorist \norganization,  he  is  unaware  of  what  government  agents  told  a  secret  court  about \nhim  and  why  that  court  decided  to  initiate  process  against  him. \nMr.  Jumaev  has  learned  that  the  agents  who  arrested  him  are  members  of \nthe  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation,  who  were  permitted  to  conceal  surveillance \nof  his  phone  conversations  and  allowed  to  rummage  through  his  home  and \npersonal  possessions.  However,  Mr.  Jumaev  doesn’t  know  why  the  FBI  was \nallowed  to  do  any  of  those  things  and  for  how  long  they  had  been  doing  them.  Mr. \nJumaev  is  now  facing  a  future  trial  in  a  United  States  federal  district  court  where \nUnited  States  law  —  the  Federal  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  (“FISA”)  --  is \ndesigned  to  prevent  him  from  discovering  why  these  covert  techniques  were \nordered  and  whether  his  rights  as  an  aggrieved  party  were  protected  in  the \n-?-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  5  of  36 \nprocess.  Here,  Mr.  Jumaev  will  explain  to  this  Honorable  Court  how  he  can  be \nafforded  rights  which  are  rightfully  his. \nll.  ADOPTION  OF  MR.  MUHTOROV’S  MOTION \nIn  accordance  with  D.C.  Colo.  LCrR  12.1,  Mr.  Jumaev  hereby  adopts  and \nincorporates  herein  by  reference  the  arguments,  reasons,  requests  for  relief,  and \nauthorities  advanced  and  cited  by  the  defendant  Jamshid  Muthtorov  in  his  Motion \nto  Suppress  FISA  Acquired  Evidence  (Supplement  to  Doc.  14)  (Doc.  125)\n(hereinafter  “Muhtorov  Motion’),  filed  on  May  25,  2012.  Mr.  Jumaev  then  provides \nthe  following  discussion  of  facts  and  emphasis  of  legal  authority  specific  to  him. \nIll.  PERTINENT  FACTS \nA.  Bakhtiyor Jumaev’s  Immigration  to  the  United  States \nMr.  Jumaev  is  a  45-year-old  citizen  of  Uzbekistan,  who,  due  to  the \npersecution  of  Muslims  (including  Mr.  Jumaev)  by  the  Uzbekistan  government, \nfled  his  native  land  and  lawfully  entered  the  United  States  during  April  of  2000. \nsee  Respondent's  Application  for Asylum  and  Related  Relief (hereinafter  “Asylum \nApplication’);  Form  |-589,  Exhibit  A.’  Mr.  Jumaev  has  resided  in  Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania  and  worked  there  and  in  nearby  communities  for  over  a  decade.  /d. \n  \n'A  number  of  Exhibits  in  these  combined  motions  may  implicate  the  current \nProtective  Order.  Accordingly,  all  of  the  Exhibits  are  filed  as  Restricted  Level  1, \ndocument  viewable  only  by  the  court  and  parties.  Exhibits  considered  in  the \npublic  domain,  such  as  the  reports  by  the  Office  of  Inspector  General  (“OIG”),  can \nbe  easily  accessed  via  the  Internet. \nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  6  of  36 \nHe  has  not  left  United  States  soil  since  he  arrived  in  2000  and  fears  he  would  be \nimprisoned  and/or  tortured  if  he  returned  to  Uzbekistan.  Id. \nQn  February  2,  2010,  Mr.  Jumaev  was  arrested  in  Philadelphia  by \nimmigration  authorities  on  the  basis  that  his  non-immigrant  residency  privileges \nhad  expired.  See  Warrant  for  Arrest  of  Alien  (hereinafter  “Arrest  Warrant’), \nExhibit  B.  Mr.  Jumaev  was  released  from  immigration  custody  on  April  20,  2010, \nhaving  posted  a  bond  of  $3,500  with  the  conditions  that  he  comply  with  the \nIntensive  Supervision  Appearance  Program  (“ISAP”).  /mmigration  Bond  ICE \nForM  1-352,  Exhibit  C.  ISAP  required,  among  other  things,  that  Mr.  Jumaev  wear \nan  ankle  bracelet/(GPS  monitoring  device  to  track  his  whereabouts  /ntensive \nSupervision  Appearance  Program,  Exhibit  D.  Mr.  Jumaev  awaits  a  hearing \nbefore  the  immigration  court  on  his  Asylum  Application,  but  the  proceedings  in \nthat  court  have  been  postponed  until  the  instant  matter  is  resolved.  See  DHS \nMotion  to  Administratively  Close  Case  and  Order,  Exhibits  E  and  F. \nMr.  Jumaev's  release  on  bond  from  immigration  custody  was  effectuated \nwith  the  financial  help  of  family  and  friends,  including  Mr.  Muhtorov.  Evidently, \nMr.  Muhtorov  decided  to  reciprocate  a  previous  kindness  that  Mr.  Jumaev  had \ndisplayed  toward  the  end  of  2009  when  he,  Mr.  Jumaev,  extended  the  hospitality \nof  his  apartment  in  Philadelphia  where  Mr.  Muhtorov  stayed  while  studying  and \ntraining  for  a  commercial  driver’s  license.  See  FBI  302  dated  February  22,  2012, \nat  1,  Exhibit  G.  Shortly  after  Mr.  Muhtorov  left  Philadelphia,  immigration \n_4-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  7  of  36 \nauthorities  commenced  their  removal  proceedings  against  Mr.  Jumaev  in  January \n2010.  See  Notice  to  Appear,  Form  |-862,  Exhibit  H.  One  of  the  officers  who \nassisted  in  the  immigration  arrest  of  Mr.  Jumaev  on  February  2,  2010,  was  FBI \nSpecial  Agent  JTA.  See  Exhibit  I.  Mr.  Jumaev  was  released  from  immigration \ncustody  on  April  20,  2010  after  posting  his  immigration  bond  as  described  above. \nFor  the  next  approximately  eleven  (11)  months,  Mr.  Muhtorov  and  Mr. \nJumaev  fostered  a  friendship  and  communicated  frequently  over  the  phone.\nDuring  this  time,  Mr.  Muhtorov  resided  in  Denver  with  his  wife  and  young \nchildren,  while  Mr.  Jumaev,  resided  in  Philadelphia  but  without  the  presence  of \nhis  wife  and  three  children  who  had  been  denied  visas  by  the  Uzbek  government \nto  join  Mr.  Jumaev  in  America.  See  FBI  302  report  of  February  2,  2010  interview \nof  Mr.  Jumaev,  Exhibit  J. \nIn  early  March  2011,  at  Mr.  Jumaev’s  request  and  in  exchange  for  $300 \ncash,  a  friend  of  his  gave  Mr.  Jumaev  a  check  dated  March  10,  2011  in  the \namount  of  $300;  the  check  was  made  payable  to  Mr.  Muhtorov.  See  FBI  302  of \ninterview  on  February  14,  2012,  Exhibit  K.  Mr.  Jumaev  sent  Mr.  Muhtorov  the \ncheck  for  $300  for  repayment  of  the  former's  debt.  /d.  After  receipt  of  the  check, \nthe  two  men  continued  their  long-distance  communications. \n  \n°SA  JTA  continued  to  play  an  integral  role  in  the  government's  investigation  of  Mr. \nJumaev  during  the  next  more  than  two  years,  culminating  in  the  agent’s  arrest  of \nMr.  Jumaev  on  March  15,  2012  in  the  case-at-bar. \nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page 8  of  36 \nB.  The  Arrests  of Mr.  Muhtorov  and  Mr.  Jumaev \nOn  January  21,  2012,  Mr.  Muhtorov  was  arrested  in  this  case  at  O’Hare \nAirport  in  Chicago  while  waiting  to  board  a  flight  to  Turkey.  The  criminal \nComplaint  against  him  had  been  filed  in  this  district  on  January  19,  2012.  See \nDoc.  No.  1  in  Case  No.  12-mj-01011-CBS.  Government  agents  throughout  the \ncountry  then  proceeded  to  interview  any  number  of  people  who  had  come  in \ncontact  with  Mr.  Muhtorov. \nOn  February  14,  2012  and  February  24,  2012,  FBI  agents,  including \nSpecial  Agent  JTA,  who  had  two  years  earlier  assisted  in  the  February  2,  2010 \nimmigration  arrest  and  interview  of  Mr.  Jumaev,  interviewed  him  for  the  second \nand  third  time.  The  agents  questioned  Mr.  Jumaev  regarding,  among  other \nthings,  his  relationship  with  Mr.  Muhtorov,  the  purpose  underlying  the  $300 \ncheck,  and  the  meaning  of  alleged  “code”  words  which  the  government \ncontended  were  used  during  telephonic  communications  and  e-mails  between \nMessrs.  Jumaev  and  Muhtorov. \nOn  March  14,  2012,  the  government  filed  a  Complaint  in  this  district \nagainst  Mr.  Jumaev.  See  Doc.  No.  1  in  Case  No.  12-mj-01039-KLM  (hereinafter, \n“Jumaev  Complaint’).  Mr.  Jumaev  was  arrested  the  following  morning,  March \n15\".  in  Philadelphia,  after  returning  home  from  work,  and  underwent  a  custodial \ninterrogation  concerning  many  of  the  same  issues  covered  during  the  two  prior\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  9  of  36 \ninterviews  of  him  in  February.  During  the  three  separate  post-Muhtorov-arrest \ninterrogations,  Mr.  Jumaev  repeatedly  maintained  that  the  purpose  of  the  $300 \ncheck  sent  in  March  2011  was  to  repay  money  that  Mr.  Muhtorov  had  lent  to  Mr. \nJumaev  for  the  latter's  immigration  case.  A  Superseding  Indictment  was \nreturned  against  both  Mr.  Jumaev  and  Mr.  Muhtorov  on  March  19,  2012  (Doc. \nNo.  50),  which  was  superseded  a  second  time  on  March  22,  2012  (Doc.  No.  59). \nC.  The  Government’s  FISA  Investigation \nThe  government  has  notified  Mr.  Jumaev  that  it  intends  to  use  evidence \nacquired  through  FISA  surveillance.  See  Notice  of  Intent  to  Use  Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Information  (Doc.  68).  However,  the  government  has \nnot  disclosed  and  will  likely  resist  disclosure  of  any  FISA  materials  —  such  as \napplications,  affidavits  and  FISA  orders  —  which  purportedly  support  the  covert \nelectronic  surveillance  and  physical  searches  conducted  in  this  matter.  This \ngovernmental  resistance  will  occur  notwithstanding  that  in  typical  Title  !Il  wiretap \ncases  arising  under  the  Ominous  Crime  Control  and  Safe  Streets  Act  of  1968,  18 \nU.S.C.  §  2510,  et  seq.,  covert  electronic  interceptions  can  be  authorized  for  the \nexact  crimes  for  which  Mr.  Jumaev  has  been  indicted  here.?

See  18  U.S.C.  §  2518(8)(b)  and  (d)  and  (9). \nIn  the  absence  of  disclosure  of  the  FISA  materials,  Mr.  Jumaev  is  unaware \nof,  inter  alia:  the  facts  surrounding  issuance  of  the  FISA  surveillance  orders: \nwhen  the  applications  were  submitted  and  when  the  orders  were  entered: \nwhether  there  were  extension  requests  and  orders;  the  nature,  scope,  and \nduration  of  the  surveillance;  whether  there  was  compliance  with  minimization \nprocedures;  and  whether  the  FISA  applications  and  affidavits  contain  intentional \nfalse  material  statements  and/or  omissions  of  material  facts,  and/or  whether  they \nwere  made  with  reckless  disregard  for  the  truth. \nD.  The  Government’s  Investigation  of Mr.  Jumaev \nThe  Jumaev  Complaint  reveals  that  the  FBI  has  been  investigating  Mr. \nJumaev  since  as  early  as  his  arrest  for  immigration  charges  in  February  2010,  at \nwhich  time  Mr.  Jumaev  provided  authorities  with  his  mobile  telephone  number. \nSee  Jumaev  Complaint,  ]]  13.  Thereafter,  the  FBI  obtained  information  against \nMr.  Jumaev  on  the  basis  of  having  obtained  “appropriate  authority”  to  engage  in \nvarious  investigative  techniques  directed  against  him.  /d.  Mr.  Jumaev  assumes \nthat  “appropriate  authority”  includes  the  FISC. \n  \ncase-at-bar,  Mr.  Jumaev  is  charged  with  two  counts  of  allegedly  violating  18 \nU.S.C.  §2339B.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  11  of  36 \nThe  Jumaev  Complaint  contains  a  gap  of  information  related  to  Mr.  Jumaev \nof  approximately  eleven  (11)  months  after  his  release  from  immigration  custody \non  April  20,  2010.  The  Complaint  then  describes  interception  of  communications \nthat  occurred  for  at  least  10  months  (March  of  2011  through  January  of  2012) \nfrom  both  Mr.  Muhtorov’s  phone  and  Mr.  Jumaev’s  phone.  Mr.  Jumaev  is  alleged \nto  have  been  speaking  to  Mr.  Muhtorov  during  the  period  when  Mr.  Muhtorov's \nphone  calls  were  intercepted.  Mr.  Jumaev’s  phone  was  also  subjected  to  FISA \nelectronic  surveillance,  resulting  in  the  interception  of  calls  from  his  phone.  As  a \nresult,  Mr.  Jumaev  is  an  “aggrieved  person”  in  accordance  with  50  U.S.C. \n§1801(k). \nThe  Jumaev  Complaint,  among  other  allegations,  asserts  that  the \ngovernment's  investigation  involved  Mr.  Muhtorov's  “communications  with  Islamic \nJihad  Union  (“lJU”)  website  administrator  and  facilitator  ‘Muhammed’  known  as \n“Abu  Muhammed.”  See  Jumaev  Complaint,  9  12.  Review  of  the  Affidavit  filed  in \nsupport  of  the  Jumaev  Complaint  and  the  FBI  “302\"  reports  disclosed  by  the \ngovernment,  allow  but  a  rudimentary  glimpse  of  the  FISA  operation  in  this  case. \nThose  materials  reveal  the  government’s  interception  of  e-mails  and  telephone \ncalls  between  Messrs.  Jumaev  and  Muhtorov  in  early  March  2011.* \n  \n*  Mr.  Jumaev,  of  course,  has  no  idea  when  the  electronic  monitoring  actually \nbegan  and  when  the  FISA  orders  were  issued.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  12  of  36 \nFBI  302  reports  reveal  the  FBI’s  physical  surveillance  of  Mr.  Jumaev  from \nthe  beginning  of  2011  to  the  end.  Examples  of  the  surveillance  include:  (a)  a \n‘trash  cover”  on  January  7,  2011,  see  Exhibit  L;  (b)  the  FBI’s  January  11,  2011 \nobservation  of  Mr.  Jumaev  walking  from  his  apartment  on  the  street  carrying  a \nplastic  bag  and  wearing  a  black  skull  cap,  see  Exhibit  M;  (c)  the  FBI’s  January  12, \n2011  following  of  a  vehicle  in  which  Mr.  Jumaev  was  a  passenger;  the  vehicle \ntraveled  from  Mr.  Jumaev’s  Philadelphia  residence  to  his  work  place  (the  Super \nFresh  grocery  store  in  Wilmington,  Delaware),  see  Exhibit  N;  (d)  another  trash \ncover  and  seizure  of  items  therefrom  on  April  28,  2011,  see  Exhibit  );  (e)  the  FBI's \nfollowing  Mr.  Jumaev  on  May  3,  2011  as  he  traveled  from  his  residence  by  foot \nand  public  transportation  (a  trolley  and  train)  to  and  from  his  ISAP  monitoring \ncenter,  see  Exhibit  P;  (f)  the  FBI’s  following  Mr.  Jumaev  on  May  17,  2011,  as  he \ntraveled  from  his  residence  on  foot  and  by  trolley  to  the  AL-Aqsa  Islamic  Center, \nsee  Exhibit  Q;  (g)  the  FBI’s  June  6,  2011  review  of  Mr.  Jumaev’s  GPS  tracking \ndata  for  a  week’s  period  in  May  2011,  which  included  details  and  summaries \nrelating  to  Mr.  Jumaev’s  travels  to  his  employment,  laundromat,  ISAP,  and \nmosque,  see  Exhibit  R;°  and  (h)  the  FBI’s  November  19,  2011  observation  of  Mr. \nJumaev  cleaning  the  floors  at  the  Acme  Grocery  Store,  his  place  of  employment \n  \nSimilar  details  and  summary  reviews  are  contained  in  two  additional  FBI  302 \nreports  for  the  month  of  May  2011. \n-10-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  13  of  36 \nin  Holmes,  Pennsyivania,  see  Exhibit  S.  Details  of  the  above-described \nsurveillance  of  Mr.  Jumaev’s  innocuous  activities  are  not  included  in  the  Jumaev \nComplaint.  As  a  result,  Mr.  Jumaev  does  not  know  if  any  of  those  surveillance \ndetails  are  included  in  any  FISA  application  that  identifies  him  as  a  target. \nMr.  Jumaev  has  not  been  informed  whether  there  were  multiple  FISA \nsurveillance  applications  and  orders  directed  against  both  him  and/or  Mr. \nMuhtorov,  or  against  each  separately,  how  frequently  the  orders  were  extended \npursuant  to  SO  US.C.  §  1805(d)(2),  or  the  particulars  concerning  the \ngovernment's  covert  investigation  of  him. \nIV.  MOTION  FOR  DISCLOSURE  OF  FISA  MATERIALS \nA.  Procedure  for Issuance  of FISA  Surveillance \nFISA  authorizes  issuance  of  “warrants”  for  electronic  surveillance  and \nphysical  searches.  There  are  two  FISA  courts:  the  FISC,  consisting  of  11  district \ncourt  judges;  and  the  FISC  of  Review,  comprised  of  three  district  or  circuit  court \njudges.  See  50  U.S.C.  §  1803(a)  &  (b).  Here,  the  FISC  will  be  referred  to  from \ntime  to  time  as  the  “issuing  court,”  while  this  Court  will  from  time  to  time  be \nreferred  to  as  the  “reviewing”  or  “trial”  court. \n  \n“Although  FISA  refers  to  orders  authorizing  physical  and  electronic  surveillance \nas  “warrants,”  Mr.  Jumaev  does  not  concede  that  such  orders  constitute \n“warrants”  as  contemplated  by  the  Fourth  Amendment. \n-ll-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  14  of  36 \nIn  order  to  avoid  unecessary  repetition  of  the  entire  arguments,  reasons, \nand  authorities  advanced  and  cited  in  the  Muhtorov  motion,  which  Mr.  Jumaev \nhas  adopted,  Mr.  Jumaev  will  briefly  highlight  some  authorities  to  better  enable \nthe  Court  to  follow  those  arguments  specific  to  Mr.  Jumaev. \nFISA  was  amended  during  October  of  2011  in  the  wake  of  the  events  of \nSeptember  11,  2011.  The  requirements  under  FISA  for  issuance  of  an  order \nauthorizing  electronic  surveillance  or  a  search  are  summarized  as  follows: \nAn  application  for  a  FISA  order  authorizing  searches  or  surveillance \nmust  be  made  under  oath  by  a  federal  officer  with  the  approval  of  the \nAttorney  General  to  the  FISC.  50  U.S.C.  §§  1801(g),  1804,  1823: \nThe  application  must  identify  or  describe  the  target  of  the  search  or \nsurveillance  and  establish  that  the  target  is  either  a  “foreign  power” \nor  an  “agent  of  a  foreign  power.”  50  U.S.C.  §§  1804(a)(3), \n1804(a)(4)(A),  1823(a)(3),  1823(a)(4)(A); \nThe  application  must  include  a  certification  from  a  high-ranking \nExecutive  Branch  official,  such  as  the  Director  of  the  FBI,  that  the \nofficial  “deems  the  information  sought  [by  the  search  or  surveillance] \nto  be  foreign  intelligence  information,”  and  that  “a_  significant \npurpose”’  of  the  search  or  surveillance  is  to  obtain  “foreign \nintelligence  information.”  50  U.S.C.  §§  1804(a)(7)(A)-(B), \n1823(a)(7)(A)-(B); \nA  single  FISC  judge  reviews  each  FISA  application  following  its \nsubmission.  50  U.S.C.  §§  1805,  1824. \n  \nPrior  to  enactment  of  the  PATRIOT  Act,  FISA  required  that  the  “primary  purpose” \nof  searches  and  surveillance  authorized  by  the  statute  was  to  obtain  foreign \nsurveillance  was  the  reduction  of  this  the  most  controversial  of  the  Patriot  Act \namendments  was  to  reduce  this  standard  to  a  “significant  purpose.” \n-12-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  15  of  36 \nBefore  approving  a  search  or  surveillance,  the  FISC  judge  must  find \nthat  the  application  establishes  “probable  cause”  to  believe  that  the \ntarget  of  the  search  or  surveillance  is  a  “foreign  power”  or  an  “agent \nof  a  foreign  power”  and  that  each  of  the  facilities  or  places  at  which \nthe  electronic  surveillance  is  directed  is  being  used  by  a  foreign \npower  or  an  agent  of  a  foreign  power.  50  U.S.C.  §§  1805(a)(2)(A)  and \n(B). \nThe  initial  duration  of  surveillance  of  an  agent  of  a  foreign  power  can \nbe  no  more  than  ninety  days.  50  U.S.C. §§  1805(d)(1). \nThe  statutory  definitions  of  some  of  the  words  and  phrases  utilized  in  FISA \nare  summarized  below: \n‘[A]gent  of  a  foreign  power”  includes  any  person  who  “knowingly \nengages  in  clandestine  intelligence  gathering  activities  for  or  on \nbehalf  of  a  foreign  power,”  or  any  person  who  “knowingly  engages  in \nsabotage  or  international  terrorism,  or  activities  that  are  in  preparation \ntherefor,  for  or  on  behalf  of  a  foreign  power.” \n“[Floreign  power”  includes  a  “group  engaged  in_  international \nterrorism.”  50  U.S.C.  §§  1801(a)(1),(4). \nB.  Disclosure  of FISA  Materials \nFISA’s  disclosure  procedures  are  shrouded  by  secrecy.  U.S.C.  §  1806(f) \nrequires  the  trial  court  to: \nreview  in  camera  and  ex  parte  the  application,  order,  and  such  other \nmaterials  relating  to  the  surveillance  as  may  be  necessary  to \ndetermine  whether  the  surveillance  of  the  aggrieved  person  was \nlawfully  authorized  and  conducted.  In  making  this  determination,  the \ncourt  may  disclose  to  the  aggrieved  person,  under  appropriate \nsecurity  procedures  and  protective  orders,  portions  of  the  application, \norder,  or  other  materials  relating  to  the  surveillance  only  where  such \ndisclosure  is  necessary  to  make  an  accurate  determination  of \nthe  legality  of the  surveillance. \n-13-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  16  of  36 \n(emphasis  supplied). \nsection  1806(g)  states  that,  if  the  trial  court  “pursuant  to  [Section  1806(f)]” \ndetermines  that  the  surveillance  was  unlawful,  it  shall  order  suppression  of \nevidence  or  information  derived  from  the  unlawful  surveillance.  Furthermore,  if  the \nreviewing  court  finds  that  FISA  surveillance  was  “lawfully  authorized  and \nconducted,  it  shall  deny  the  motion  of  the  aggrieved  person  except  to  the  extent \nthat  due  process  requires  discovery  or  disclosure.”  /d.  By  its  very  terms,  FISA \nthus  envisions  a  scenario  where  disclosure  is  authorized  in  order  to  accurately \ndetermine  the  legality  of  surveillance,  even  though  a  motion  to  suppress might \nsubsequently  be  denied. \nFISA’s  methodology  concerning  discovery  and  requiring  motions  to \nsuppress  FISA-acquired  evidence  to  be  prematurely-filed  presents  an  archetypal \nchicken-and-egg  conundrum.  As  a  precondition  for  a  reviewing  court  to  order \ndiscovery,  FISA  requires  the  accused  to  first  file  a  motion  to  suppress  FISA- \nacquired  evidence.  The  motion  to  suppress  thus  must  be  filed  without  defense \ncounsel's  having  access  to  discovery  needed  to  justify  the  suppression  motion. \nThe  dilemma  was  recognized  in  Mayfield  v.  United  States,  504  F.  Supp.  2d  1023, \n1039  (D.  Or.  2007),  rev'd  on  other  grounds,  599  F.3d  964  (9\"  Cir.  2010):  “FISA \nalso  allows  the  government  to  retain  information  collected,  and  use  the  collected \n-14.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  17  of  36 \ninformation  in  criminal  prosecutions  without  providing  any  meaningful  opportunity \nfor  the  target  of  the  surveillance  to  challenge  its  legality.” \nThe  FISA  discovery  procedures  also  place  the  trial  court  in  the  non- \ntraditional  position  of  reviewing  presumptively  accurate  assertions  by  the \ngovernment  but,  in  many  instances,  speculations  and  incomplete  guess  work  by \ndefense  counsel.  Once  the  motion  to  suppress  is  filed  and  discovery  is  requested, \nthe  court  is  required  to  engage  in  ex  parte  and  in  camera  proceedings  to \ndetermine  whether  disclosure  of  FISA  materials  is  warranted  in  order  to  evaluate \nthe  legality  of  the  FISA  orders.  Since  the  review  is  ex  parte  and  unaided  by  the \ntrue  adversarial  process,  the  trial  court’s  review  is  de  novo  and  no  deference  is \naccorded  the  FISC’s  determinations.  United  States  v.  Rosen,  447  F.  Supp.  2d \n038,  545  (D.  Va.  2006;  see  also  United  States  v.  Squillacote,  221  F.3d  542,  544 \n(4\"  Cir.  2000);  United  States  v.  Warsame,  547  F.  Supp.  2d  982,  990  (D.  Minn. \n2008).  Once  the  in  camera,  ex  parte  procedure  is  triggered,  the  trial  court  may \ndisclose  such  materials  “only  where  such  disclosure  is  necessary  to  make  an \naccurate  determination  of  the  legality  of  the  surveillance.”  50  U.S.C.  §  1806(f); \nsee  also  50  U.S.C.  §1825(g).  The  legislative  history  explains  that  the  question  of \nlegality  may  be  complicated  by  factors  such  as: \nindications  of  possible  misrepresentation  of  fact,  vague  identification \nof  the  persons  to  be  surveilled,  or  surveillance  records  which  include \na  significant  amount  of  nonforeign  intelligence  information,  calling \n~|5-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  18  of  36 \ninto  question  compliance  with  the  minimization  standards  contained \nin  the  order. \nUnited  States  v.  Belfield,  692  F.2d  141,  147  (D.C.  Cir.  1982)  (quoting  S.  Rep.  No. \n95-701,  95\"  Cong.  2d  Sess.  64  (1978)). \nC.  Mr.  Jumaev  is  Neither a  Foreign  Power nor an  Agent  Thereof \nAs  previously  noted,  a  FISA  surveillance  order  must  determine  that  the \ntarget  Is  a  “foreign  power”  or  an  “agent  of  a  foreign  power.”  FISA  requires  the \ncourt  to  accept  the  government’s  assertion  that  a  target  is  a  foreign  power  or  an \nagent  of  a  foreign  power  unless  that  assertion  is  deemed  to  be  facially  erroneous. \nUnited  States  v  Mayfield,  504  F.  Supp  2d  at  1032-33.  The  Muhtorov  Motion  at  10- \n13  has  addressed  the  issue  of  an  assertion  that  a  “target”  is  a  foreign  power  or  an \nagent  of  a  foreign  power,  and  that  discussion  will  not  be  repeated  here. \nCompared  to  any  other  accused  in  this  case,  Mr.  Jumaev  is,  based  upon \nthe  evidence,  exponentially  less  susceptible  of  being  considered  either  a  foreign \npower  or  an  agent  of  a  foreign  power.  He  has  resided  in  the  United  States  for \nover  12  years,  nearly  all  of  that  time  in  the  same  apartment  in  Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Mr.  Jumaev  had  membership  in  or \nconnection  to  the  IJU  or  any  foreign  power,  or  that  he  engaged  in  any \ncommunications  with  any  representative  of  the  IJU  or  any  terrorist  organization \nduring  the  entirety  of  his  residence  in  this  country,  or  at  any  time  before  he  came \nto  this  country. \n-16-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  19  of  36 \nThe  government's  surveillance  of  Mr.  Jumaev,  which  included  observing \nhim  traveling  to  his  work  place  and  cleaning  the  floors  there,  watching  him  walk  in \nhis  neighborhood,  segregating  his  trash,  following  him  in  a  trolley  and  train  to  his \nISAP  facility,  and  furtively  accompanying  him  in  a  trolley  ride  to  the  mosque  where \nhe  prays,  do  not  report  Mr.  Jumaev  being  in  the  presence  of  any  terrorist \norganization,  and  do  not  conform  to  FISA’s  minimization  requirements  because  of \nthe  totally  innocuous  nature  of  the  activities  observed.  Here,  the  government \nevidently  chose  to  go  to  the  FISC  despite  the  innocent  nature  of  the  above \nevidence  and  the  lack  of  any  indicia  that  Mr.  Jumaev  was  in  any  way  involved  in \nthe  acquisition  or  dissemination  of  foreign  intelligence  information  affecting  our \nnational  security.  Thus,  the  primary  and  sole  purpose  of  the  government's \ninvestigation  of  Mr.  Jumaev  evidently  involved  a  belief  that  he  was  engaged  in  or \nwas  about  to  commit  a  criminal  offense,  including  a  violation  of  U.S.  immigration \nlaws.  However,  clearly,  the  government  identified  Mr.  Jumaev  as  a  target  in  its \nFISA  investigation  since  conversations  of  his  were  intercepted  from  his  phone. \nSee  Jumaev  Complaint  §  28  (call  on  January  24,  2012  between  Mr.  Jumaev  and  a \nknown  associate,  which  occurred  three  days  after  Mr.  Muhtorov’s  arrest).° \n  \n§  Obviously,  Mr.  Jumaev  is  arguing  in  the  blind  here.  It  is  not  unreasonable  to \nbelieve  that  Mr.  Muhtorov  may  have  been  the  government's  sole  target  of  a  FISC \norder  and  that  conversations  between  him  and  Mr.  Jumaev  were  overheard \nduring  the  time  of  and/or  extension(s)  of  that  initial  order.  The  government  could \nsubsequently  have  also  obtained  a  separate  FISC  order  directed  against  Mr. \n-|7-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  20  of  36 \nThe  gravaman  of  the  offense  alleged  against  Mr.  Jumaev  is  his  sending  a \n$300  check  to  Mr.  Muhtorov  on  or  about  March  10,  2011,  which  Mr.  Jumaev \nrepeatedly  explained  to  the  FBI  was  in  repayment  of  his  debt  to  Mr.  Muhtorov.  In \nits  49-paragraph,  19-page  Complaint,  the  affiant  devotes  one  short  sentence  at \nthe  end  of  paragraph  37  to  Mr.  Jumaev’s  repayment  claim.  The  balance  of  the \nComplaint  is  a  skewed  recitation  of  allegations  intending  to  effect  a  connection \nbetween  Mr.  Muhtorov  and  the  Islamic  Jihand  Union  (“IJU\"),  which  the  Muhtorov\nMotion  challenges,  and  an  even  more  attenuated,  if  not  total  absent,  connection \nbetween  Mr.  Jumaev  and  the  iJU. \nThe  government  seeks  to  support  its  belief  that  the  $300  check  was \nintended  to  be  funneled  to  IJU  by  arguing  that  Mr.  Jumaev  engaged  in  telephone \nconversations  and  the  exchange  of  e-mails  with  Muhtorov  using  “code”  language \nand  that  the  code  language  reflected  Mr  Jumaev’s  support  of  the  IJU.  However, \nexpressions  of  support  in  of  themselves  are  protected  speech  under  FISA.  See \n50  U.S.C.  §1805(a)  (the  FISC  judge  may  not  consider  a  United  States  person  an \nagent  of  a  foreign  power  “solely  upon  the  basis  of  activities  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment.”  (emphasis  supplied)). \n  \nJumaev  while  any  order  against  Mr.  Muhtorov  was  also  extant.  In  either  instant, \nMr.  Jumaev  is  an  “aggrieved  person”  under  the  statute,  but  he  is  compelled  to \nadvance  speculative  challenges  to  the  FISA  materials  without  knowledge  of  the \ninformation  contained  in  those  materials. \nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  21  of  36 \nD.  The  FBI’s  Questionable  FISA  Investigation  of Mr.  Jumaev  was \nPreceded  by  the  FBI's  Historical Abuses  of the  PATRIOT Act \nHere,  there  is  an  abundance  of  historical  evidence  and a  significant  amount \nof  nonforeign  surveillance  information  regarding  Mr.  Jumaev,  which  was  never \nmentioned  in  the  Jumaev  Complaint.  This  raises  the  specter  and  likelihood  of \nmisrepresentations  and/or  material  omissions  of  fact  tainting  the  FISA  materials. \nThat  taint  calls  into  question  the  legality  of  the  manner  in  which  the  government \nhas  preceded  in  its  FISA  investigation  of  Mr.  Jumaev.  FISA  and  Patriot  Act  abuses \nby  the  government,  however,  would  not  be  novel  to  this  case. \n1.  The  Abuses  Reported  in  2000 \nStarting  in  September  2000,  the  government  voluntarily  disclosed  and \nconfessed  error  in  some  75  FISA  applications  related  to  major  terrorist  attacks \ndirected  against  the  United  States.  See  /n  Re  All  Matters  Submitted  to  the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court,  218  F.  Supp.  2d  611,  620  (2002).  Those \nerrors  related  to  misstatements  and  omissions  of  material  fact,  including: \na.  an  erroneous  statement  in  the  FBI  Director’s  FISA  certification  that  the \ntarget  of  the  FISA  was  not  under  criminal  investigation; \nb.  erroneous  statements  in  the  FISA  affidavits  of  FBI  agents  concerning  the \nseparation  of  the  overlapping  intelligence  and  criminal  investigations,  and \nthe  unauthorized  sharing  of  FISA  information  with  FBI  criminal  investigators \nand  assistant  U.S.  attorneys: \nc.  omissions  of  material  facts  from  FBI  FISA  affidavits  relating  to  a  prior \nrelationship  between  the  FBI  and  a  FISA  agent,  and  the  interview  of  a  FISA \ntarget  by  an  assistant  U.S.  attorney. \n-19-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  22  of  36 \nId.;  but  see  United  States  v.  Warsame,  547  F.  Supp.  2d  982,  987-88  (D.  Minn. \n2008)  (court  paid  short  shrift  to  the  above-quoted  report,  stating  that  misdeeds  in \nprior  FISA  cases  were  not  in  issue;  rather,  the  issue  was  whether  errors  could  be \nshown  in  the  investigation  of  Warsame  so  as  to  mandate  disclosure).  Regrettably, \nsuch  a  inviting  challenge  can  only  be  successfully  executed  by  clairvoyants,  of \nwhich  Mr.  Jumaev’s  counsel  is  not  one.  Moreover,  the  errors  of  previous  FISA \nand  Patriot  Act  cases  do  not  stop  with  the  mea  culpas  admitted  to  by  the\ngovernment  in  2000. \n2.  The  Abuses  Reported  in  2001 \nIn  March  of  2001,  the  government  reported  similar  misstatements  in  another \nseries  of  FISA  applications  in  which  there  were  supposedly  a  “wall”  between \nseparate  intelligence  and  criminal  squads  in  FBI  field  offices  to  screen  FISA \nintercepts,  when  in  fact  all  of  the  FBI  agents  were  on  the  same  squad  and  all  of \nthe  screening  was  done  by  the  one  supervisor  overseeing  both  investigations. \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court,  218  F.  Supp.  2d  at  621. \n3.  The  Abuses  Reported  in  2006 \nThe  March  8,  2006  Department  of  Justice,  Office  of  the  Inspector  General \n(hereinafter  “OIG”)  Report  to  Congress  on  Implementation  of  Section  1001  of  the \nUSA  Patriot  Act  described  certain  failures  of  the  FBI  to  adhere  to  FISA’s \nrequirements.  See  United  States  v.  Rosen,  447  F.  Supp  2d  538,  552  (E.D.  Va. \nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  23  of  36 \n2006).  These  failures  are  identified  in  the  OIG’s  March  8,  2006  Report  at  24-31, \nSec.  V,  C.  and  concern  the  years  2004  and  2005,  Exhibit  T.  They  fall  into  three \ncategories,  namely,  (1)  improper  utilization  of  authorities  under  FISA;  (2)  failure  to \nadhere  to  Attorney  General  Guidelines  or  implementing  FBI  policy;  and  (3) \nimproper  utilization  of  authorities  involving  National  Security  Letters  (‘NSLs’).  /d. \nat  24. \nThe  failures  encompassed  a  wide  range  of  intelligence  activities  used  by  the \nFBI,  including  possible  violations  generally  related  to  “over-collection’  and \n“overruns.”  An  “over-collection”  refers  to  information  gathered  within  the \nauthorized  period  of  a  FISC  order  but  outside  the  scope  or  intent  of  the  order.  An \n“overrun”  refers  to  investigative  activity  conducted  outside  the  time  period  of  the \nFISC  order  or  outside  the  authorized  period  of  investigative  activity.  The  Report \nrevealed  that  the  average  duration  of  over-collections  and  overruns  was \napproximately  24  days  in  2004  and  16  days  in  2005.  /d.  at  24-25.  The  duration  of \npossible  violations  of  the  Attorney  General  Guidelines  or  FBI  implementing  policy \ngoverning  national  security  investigations  averaged  185  days  in  2004  and  130 \ndays  in  2005.  /d.  at  25.  Approximately,  54  percent  of  the  reports  examined  by  the \nOIG  for  2004  and  47  percent  of  the  reports  examined  for  2005  fell  into  the \ncategory  of  improper  use  of  FISA  authorities.  /d  at  27.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  24  of  36 \nThe  nature  of  the  information  that  may  have  been  illegally  collected  in  2004 \nand  2005  included  telephone  calls,  audio  recordings,  facsimile  intercepts,  e-mail \ncommunications,  financial  records,  and  credit  reports.  /d.  Discovery  received \nfrom  the  government  to  date  by  Mr.  Jumaev  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to, \ntelephone  calls,  audio  recordings,  e-mail  communications,  text  messages,  and \nfinancial  records. \nThe  court  in  Rosen  characterized  the  failures  enumerated  in  the  foregoing \n2006  OIG  report  as  general  assessments  and  “no  more  probative  of  a  failure  of \nminimization  in  this  case  than  a  general  study  of  errors  committed  over  a  period  of \nyears  in  baseball  would  be  probative  of  whether  errors  occurred  in  a  specific \ngame.”  Rosen,  447  F.  Supp.  2d  at  552.  The  difference,  however,  between  Rosen \nand  this  case  is  that  Mr.  Jumaev  has  shown  minimization  and  other  failures  as \nchronicled  in  Section  Ill,  supra,  and  in  this  Section  IV.  Moreover,  unlike  the  limited \nhistory  of  2004  and  2005  failures  shown  in  Rosen,  the  FBI’s  abuses  of  the  Patriot \nAct  from  2000  through  2011  have  been  systemic  and  reflective  of  an  ongoing  and \ncontinual  pattern  of  failures  to  adhere  to  the  requirements  of  FISA. \n4,  The  Abuses  Reported  in  2008 \nA  report  released  on  March  13,  2008  by  the  OIG  on  the  FBI’s  use  of \nNational  Security  Letters  (“NSLs”)  revealed  a  systemic  widespread  abuse  of \npower  according  to  the  ACLU,  which,  among  other  organizations,  has  played  a \n2).\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  25  of  36 \nrole  of  “watchdog”  regarding  the  government’s  abuse  of  Patriot  Act  Powers.  See \nExhibit  U.  The  Jumaev  Complaint  at  J]  13  states  that  “[u]pon  obtaining  appropriate \nauthority,  the  FBI  has  lawfully  searched  and  obtained  information  through  various \ninvestigative  techniques.”  Nowhere,  however,  does  the  Complaint  enumerate  the \nvarious  investigative  techniques  utilized  by  the  FBI.  As  the  ACLU  press  release \nreveals,  the  FBI’s  power  to  collect  private  information  against  individuals  by  the \nissuance  of  NSLs  without  court  approval  was  widely  expanded  by  the  PATRIOT \nAct.  Id. \nThe  OIG’s  March  13,  2008  report  was  a  follow-up  to  its  initial  report  of  a \nyear  earlier  wherein  the  OIG  found  “the  serious  misuse  of  NSL  authorities.”  See  A \nReview  of  the  FBI’s  Use  of  National  Security  Letters:  Assessment  of  Corrective \nActions  and  Examination  of NSL  Usage  in  2006.  Office  of  the  Inspector  General, \nMarch  2008,  pp.  1-3,  6-9,  Exhibit  V.  Although  it  noted  that  the  FBI  and  the \nDepartment,  !.e.  Department  of  Justice  (“DOJ”)  had  made  significant  progress  in \nimplementing  the  recommendations  from  the  March  2007  report,  the  OIG  found, \nhowever,  that  the  FBI’s  review  of  its  own  field  files  did  not  capture  all  NSL-related \npossible  intelligence  violations  and  therefore  “did  not  provide  a  fully  accurate \nbaseline  from  which  to  measure  future  improvement  in  compliance  with  NSL \nauthorities.  /d  at  8.  The  OIG  concluded,  “the  results  of  the  FBI’s  field  review \nlikely  understated  the  rate  of  possible  violations.”  /d.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  26  of  36 \n5%.  The  Abuses  Reported  in  2011 \nFinally,  as  recent  as  approximately  one  year  ago,  still  other  forms  of \nPATRIOT  Act  abuses  have  come  to  the  limelight  in  spite  of  the  FBI’s  intent  to \nshield  potential  abuses  from  the  public  eye.  When  FBI  Director  Robert  Mueller \ntestified  before  the  Senate  Judiciary  Hearing  on  or  about  March  30,  2011,  he \nreportedly  denied  that  the  three  about-to-be-expiring  provisions  of  the  PATRIOT \nAct  had  been  the  subject  of  any  negative  reports  of  a  finding  of  abuse.  See \nExhibit  W.  In  at  least  one  “John  Doe”  roving  wiretap  surveillance,  the \nconversations  of  “young  children”  were  purportedly  monitored  for  approximately \nfive  days.  /d.  Both  Mr.  Jumaev  and  Mr.  Muhtorov  have  children,  but  it  is  doubtful \nthe  government  will  produce  in  discovery  any  intercepted  telephonic  conversations \nthat  may  involve  either  defendant’s  children.  The  adversarial  process,  however,  is \nbetter  designed  to  flush  out  such  abuses,  if  they  occurred. \nE.  Without  Disclosure  of the  FISA  Materials, \nthe  Government’s  Abuses  will  Continue  with  Impunity \nMir.  Jumaev  is  mindful  that  apparently  no  trial  court  has  found  it  necessary \nto  disclose  FISA  materials  to  a  criminal  defendant  to  assist  the  court’s \ndetermination  of  the  lawfulness  of  either  electronic  surveillance  or  physical \nsearches  under  FISA.  See  United  States  v.  Mubayyid,  521  F.  Supp.  2d  125,  130 \n24.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  27  of  36 \n(D.  Mass.  2007)  (collecting  cases).°  However,  none  of  those  cases  collected  in \nMubayyid  and  decided  since  that  decision  have  made  the  kind  of  compelling \nshowing  for  disclosure  as  Mr.  Jumaev  has  made  here.  Further,  it  is  precisely  why \nthis  unblemished  record  by  the  government  demands  even  closer  scrutiny  by  the \nreviewing  court.  A  perpetual  prophylactic  shield  of  FISA  materials  provides  a \ncomplacent  and  fertile  environment  for  the  government  to  do  and  say  anything  it \nwants  in  a  FISA  setting,  especially  where  the  government  knows  its  actions  will \nnever  see  the  light  of  day  except  for  a  future  generic  OIG  report  or  ACLU  outcry. \nThe  ACLU  and  other  private  organizations  can  seek  to  be  effective \nwatchdogs  over  FBI  abuses  of  the  Patriot  Act  and  the  OIG  can  summarize  those \nabuses  for  Congress,  but  only  the  trial  court  can  ensure  the  Act’s  compliance  in \nany  particular  case.  “If  one  feature  of  the  judiciary  is  essential  above  all  others,  it \nis  that  ‘there  is  no  liberty,  if  the  power  of  judgment  be  not  separated  from  the \nlegislative  and  executive  powers.” wy  /n  the  Matter  of  Local  Rules  of  Practice  District \nof  Colorado,  J.  Kane,  dissenting  from  the  amendments  to  the  Local  Rules  of \nPractice,  effective  December  1,  2011. \nAmple  evidence  has  been  presented  to  this  Court  of  long-term  significant \nabuses  of  FISA  by  the  executive’s  unbridled  and  clandestine  powers.  Specific \n  \n*Mr.  Jumaev's  research  has  not  uncovered  any  reported  case  since  Mubayyid, \nsupra,  that  has  ordered  such  disclosure.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  28  of  36 \ninstances  of  overreaching  and  failure  of  minimization,  a  lack  of  any  connection  to \nor  relationship  with  any  alleged  foreign  power,  and  material  omissions  from  the \nFBI's  accusatory  complaint  call  into  question  the  government’s  conduct  here.  The \ntime  has  now  ripened  for  those  abuses  and  powers  to  be  aided  by  the  adversarial \nprocess.  The  FISA  materials  must  be  disclosed.  Otherwise,  Kafka’s  Josef  K.  will \nbecome  more  truth  than  fiction. \nF.  Disclosure  of the  FISA  Materials  can  Occur  under \nAppropriate  Security  Measures  and  Protective  Orders \nAs  provided  in  18  U.S.C.  §1806(f),  disclosure  of  FISA  materials  can  occur \nunder  appropriate  security  procedures  and  protective  orders.  The  Court  has \nalready  conducted  ex  parte  CIPA  hearings  for  each  side  under  appropriate \nprecautions.  A  Protective  Order  is  currently  in  place  designed  to  protect \ndisclosure  and  dissemination  of  the  government's  discovery.  Government \npersonnel,  including  principal  officials  in  the  Attorney  General’s  office,  Assistant \nUnited  States  Attorneys,  DOJ  counsel  for  its  counterterrorism  division,  and  Special \nAgents  of  the  FBI  and  other  law  enforcement  entities,  have  most  likely  assisted  in \nthe  preparation,  presentation,  and  dissemination  of  the  FISA  materials.  Those \nmaterials  have  thus  been  scrutinized  and  reviewed  by  a  number  of  individuals  on \nthe  prosecution’s  side.  Those  individuals  have  presumably  maintained  the \nconfidentiality  and  security  of  these  materials.  It  is  not  presumptuous  to  contend \nthat  defense  counsel  for  Mr.  Muhtorov  and  Mr.  Jumaev,  as  officers  of  the  Court, \n-26-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  29  of  36 \ncannot  likewise  maintain  the  confidentiality  and  security  of  those  materials  and \nabide  by  any  security  precautions  and/or  protective  orders  implemented  by  the \nCourt  for  review  of  the  same. \nG.  Prayer  for  Disclosure  of FISA  Material \nBased  on  the  foregoing  reasons,  Mr.  Jumaev  seeks  discovery  of  the \nfollowing  materials: \n1.  All  FISA  applications,  certifications,  and  affidavits  submitted  to  the \nFISC  in  connection  with  the  government’s  investigation  of  Messrs.  Muhtorov  and \nJumaev  in  this  case; \n2.  Any  and  all  transcripts  of  any  ex  parte  proceeding  that  occurred \nbefore  the  FISC  that  issued  any  FISA  orders  in  this  case;  and \n3.  All  records  concerning  minimization  procedures  and_  the \nimplementation  of  such  procedures. \nV.  PRELIMINARY  CHALLENGE  TO  FISA-ACQUIRED  EVIDENCE: \nSUPPRESSION  AND  UNCONSTITUTIONALITY \nAs  has  been  previously  discussed,  the  requirement  that  a  defendant  must \nfile  a  motion  to  suppress  before  obtaining  FISA  discovery  requires  defense \ncounsel  to  file  a  suppression  motion  without  being  first  provided  the  opportunity  to \ndiscover  the  underlying  facts  that  would  support  a  suppression  motion.  Mr. \nJumaev  joins  Mr.  Muhtorov  in  asserting  that  suppression  should  be  granted  on \ngrounds  that  include,  but  are  not  limited  to: \n-27-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  30  of  36 \n1.  The  government  failed  to  comply  with  statutory  procedures  leading  to \nissuance  of  FISA  orders  authorizing  searches  and/or  surveillance; \n2.  The  government’s  application  to  FISC  failed  to  establish  probable \ncause  that  the  target  was  either  a  “foreign  power”  or  an  “agent  of  a  foreign  power’: \n3.  The  application  and  supporting  documents  do  not  establish  that  either \na  “primary  purpose”  or  a  “significant  purpose”  of  the  FISA  order  is  to  obtain  foreign \nintelligence  information; \n4.  The  FISA  application  and  supporting  materials  are  unconstitutionally \noverbroad  and  lacked  particularity  (see  additional  discussion  that  follows); \n5.  The  PATRIOT  act  amendment  to  FISA  that  lowered  the  “foreign \nintelligence  information”  requirement  from  the  “primary  purpose’  to  a  “significant \npurpose”  is  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  Mr.  Jumaev;  and \n6.  Mr.  Jumaev  reserves  the  right  to  assert  suppression  challenges \nbased  upon  what  might  be  revealed  in  future  discovery. \nOn  the  issue  of  FISA’s  unconstitutionality,  Mr.  Jumaev  urges  the  court  to \nadopt  the  reasoning  in  Mayfield  v.  United  States,  which  held  that  FISA,  as \namended  by  the  PATRIOT  Act,  was  unconstitutional  on  its  face.  (Mayfield  was  a \ncivil  Bivens  action;  the  Ninth  Circuit  did  not  reach  the  merits  of  the  constitutionality \nissue  because  the  circuit  court  only  reversed  on  the  issue  of  standing).  It  is  also \nimportant  to  note  that  two  cases  that  addressed  constitutional  challenges  to  the \npost-PATRIOT  Act  FISA’s  reduction  of  “primary  purpose”  to  “significant  purpose” \ndid  not  determine  whether  the  amended  FISA  was  unconstitutional  because  those \ncases  held  that  their  facts  satisfied  the  “primary  purpose  test.”  See  United  States \nv.  Stewart,  590  F.3d  93  (2d  Cir.  2009);  United  States  v.  Hammoud,  381  F.3d  316 \n-28.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  31  of  36 \n(4\"  Cir.  2004).  Moreover,  Stewart  found  that  United  States  v.  Duggan,  743  F.  2d \n99  (2d  Cir.  1984)  was  controlling  precedent  in  the  circuit  even  though  Duggan  was \ndecided  before  the  PATRIOT  Act  was  enacted. \nVI.  MOTION  FOR  LEAVE  TO  FILE  A  FRANKS  MOTION  AFTER \nRECEIPT  OF  ALL  THE  GOVERNMENT’S  DISCOVERY \nDisclosure  of  FISA  materials  is  also  necessary  to  permit  defense  counsel  to \nevaluate  and  file  a  motion  to  suppress  under  Franks  v.  Delaware,  438  U.S.  154 \n(1978),  which  upheld  the  right  of  the  defendant  to  challenge  the  validity  of  an \naffidavit  in  support  of  a  search  warrant.  Under  Franks,  a  defendant  is  entitled  to \nan  evidentiary  hearing  if  the  veracity  challenge  is  supported  by  a  specific  offer  of \nproof  with  affidavits  that  alleges  a  deliberate  falsehood  or  a  reckless  disregard  for \nthe  truth.  If  the  allegations  are  proven,  the  warrant  is  to  be  examined  for  a  finding \nof  probable  cause  absent  the  false  statements.  /d.  at  172. \nWiretap  applications  and  affidavits  are  subject  to  the  requirements  of  Franks \nand  its  progeny.  See  United  States  v.  Green,  175  F.3d  822,  828  (10\"  Cir.  1999): \nsee  also  United  States  v.  Ramirez-Encarnacion,  291  F.3d  1219,  1223  (10\"  Cir. \n2002).  Thus,  if  “a  wiretap  affidavit  omits  material  information  that  would  vitiate \neither  the  necessity  or  the  probable  cause  requirements  had  it  been  included,  the \nresultant  evidence  must  be  suppressed.”  Green,  175  F.3d  at  828. \nA  defendant  is  entitled  to  a  hearing  under  Franks  after  making  a  substantial \npreliminary  showing  that  the  affiant  included  a  false  statement  in  the  wiretap \n-29.\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  32  of  36 \naffidavit,  either  knowingly  and  intentionally  or  with  reckless  disregard  for  the  truth, \nand  that  such  misstatement  was  necessary  to  the  finding  of  probable  cause  or \nnecessity.  See  United  States  v.  Small,  229  F.  Supp.  2d  1166,  1189  (D.  Colo. \n2002).  A  material  omission  in  the  wiretap  affidavit  also  entitles  a  defendant  to  a \nFranks  hearing  if  the  same  requisite  showing  is  made.  Green,  175  F.3d  at  828. \nCourts  have  explicitly  held  or  assumed  that  Franks  applies  to  FISA \nsurveillance  and  searches.  The  court  in  Duggan  reasoned  that: \nFISA  cannot,  of  course,  give  the  government  carte  blanche  to  obtain \na  surveillance  order  in  violation  of  a  target’s  right  to  due  process,  and \nan  application  in  which  the  requisite  representations  were  fraudulently \nmade  would  constitute  such  a  violation.  However,  we  would  think  that \nsuch  a  due  process  argument  as  to  FISA  orders  should  be  governed \nby  the  principles  set  forth  in  Franks  v.

Thus,  the \nrepresentations  and  certifications  submitted  in  support  of  an \napplication  for  FISA  surveillance  should  be  presumed  valid.  See  jd. \nat  171.  To  be  entitled  to  a  hearing  as  to  the  validity  of  those \npresentations,  the  person  challenging  the  FISA  surveillance  would  be \nrequired  to  make  “a  substantial  preliminary  showing  that  a  false \nstatement  knowingly  and  intentionally,  or  with  reckless  disregard  for \nthe  truth,  was  included”  in  the  application  and  that  the  allegedly  false \nstatement  was  “necessary”  to  the  FISA  Judge’s  approval  of  the \napplication.  /d.  at  155-56. \n743  F.2d  59  at  77;  see  also  United  States  v.

It  is  only \nafter  a  review  of  that  material  can  Mr.  Jumaev  then  properly  make  his  preliminary \nshowing  of  the  entirety  of  the  recklessly  made  false  statements  and/or  material \nomissions  from  the  FISA  application  in  order  to  obtain  a  Franks  hearing.  If  courts \nforeclose  a  Franks  challenge  on  the  basis  that  an  accused  has  failed  to  make  a \nsufficient  preliminary  showing,  it  is  because  such  a  showing  is  impossible  to  make \nwithout  knowledge  of  the  contents  of  the  FISA  application.  Such  a  judicial  position \nthen  renders  vacuous  a  challenge  under  Franks. \n-31-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  34  of  36 \nAccordingly,  Mr.  Jumaev  respectfully  requests  leave  of  the  Court  to  file  a \nFranks  motion  within  a  reasonable  time  after  receipt  of  all  the  government's \ndiscovery  in  this  matter  and  for  such  further  relief  as  the  Court  may  deem  proper. \nVil.  CONCLUSIONS \nA.  Disclosure  of  FISA  Materials \nMr.  Jumaev  is  an  aggrieved  party  because  conversations  in  which  he  was  a \nparty  with  Mr.  Muhtorov  over  the  latter’s  phone  were  subject  to  FISA  electronic \nsurveillance.  He  is  also  an  aggrieved  party  because  his  phone  was  also  subject  to \nFISA  surveillance. \nNo  evidence  exists  that  Mr.  Jumaev  is  a  foreign  power  or  an  agent  of  a \nforeign  power. \nThe  physical  surveillance  of  Mr.  Jumaev  did  not  reveal  any  activities  of  his \nthat  involved  him  acquiring  or  participating  in  the  acquisition  or  dissemination  of \nforeign  intelligence  information  that  affected  our  national  security.  The  primary \nand  sole  purpose  of  the  FISA  surveillance  of  him  was  to  obtain  evidence  that  he \nwas  engaged  or  seeking  to  engage  in  criminal  activity,  including  immigration  law \nviolations. \nThe  government  failed  to  adhere  to  FISA’s  minimization  requirements.  The \ngovernment's  failures  in  its  investigation  of  Mr.  Jumaev  warrant  disclosure  of  the \nFISA  materials. \n-32-\nCase  1:12-cr-00033-JLK  Document  157  Filed  07/30/12  USDC  Colorado  Page  35  of  36 \nB.  To  Suppress  and  to  Find  Unconstitutional \nFor  the  reasons  stated  in  both  Muhtorov’s  Motion  and  Mr.  Jumaev’s \narguments,  the  Court  should  grant  the  suppression  of  all  FISA-acquired  evidence \nand  declare  FISA  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  Mr.  Jumaev. \nC.  For  Leave  to  File  a  Franks  Motion \nFor  the  reasons  and  arguments  advanced  by  Mr.  Jumaev,  the  Court  should \nallow  Mr.  Jumaev  to  file  a  Franks  challenge  after  disclosure  of  the  FISA  materials\nand  the  government's  discovery. \nWHEREFORE,  Mr.  Jumaev  prays  as  described  above  and  for  whatever \nfurther  relief  the  Curt  may  deem  proper. \nDATED:  July  30,  2012 \ns/David  B.

JAMSHID MUHTOROV, and\n2.  BAKHTIYOR JUMAEV,\nDefendants.\n________________________________________________________________________\nORDER ON PENDING MOTIONS\nREGARDING FISA-ACQUIRED EVIDENCE\n________________________________________________________________________\nKane, J.\nThis matter is before me on the following Motions:\n• Defendant Muhtorov’s Motion to Suppress FISA Acquired Evidence for\nPurposes of Detention (Doc. 14) and related Supplement (Doc. 125); and\n• Defendant Jumaev’s Combined FISA-related Motions: (1) to Adopt\nDefendant Muhtorov’s Supplemented Motion to Suppress; (2) for\nDisclosure Of FISA Materials; (3) for a Preliminary Challenge To Suppress\nFISA Acquired Evidence; and (4) for Leave To File A Franks Motion After\nReceipt All The Government’s Discovery (Doc. 157).  \nDefendants seek disclosure of all applications, orders, and related materials obtained\npursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as amended (“FISA”); suppression\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 196   Filed 09/24/12   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 5\nof information obtained or derived pursuant to FISA; and leave to file a motion for an\nevidentiary hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).  In\nconsequence and pursuant to statute, the government has filed an affidavit in which the\nAttorney General of the United States swears that disclosure of the FISA-acquired\nevidence or an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States. \nAs the statutes require, I have conducted an ex parte and in camera examination of\nthe Motions, the government’s unredacted and sealed brief in support of nondisclosure,\nalong with the affidavits and documents filed under seal and relevant to the Defendants’\nMotions.  From this examination and review of applicable authorities cited by the\ngovernment and the Defendants, as well as authorities produced by my own research, I\nconclude on that basis the electronic surveillance and physical searches at issue were\nlawfully authorized and conducted, that the FISA materials need not and should not be\ndisclosed in the interests of national security, and that the fruits of the electronic\nsurveillance and physical searches should not be suppressed at trial.  Therefore, the\nseveral motions are DENIED.\nFirst, I make note of a general reluctance on my part as a judge to engage in any ex\nparte judicial activity and do so only when required by law.  While the responsibility of\ndefense counsel to protect the rights of defendants cannot be overstated, it is important to\nnote that in the context of defendants’ rights to discover FISA-acquired evidence, it is not\nan exclusive responsibility.  The court itself is charged to protect the rights of defendants\nand to assure fairness in all proceedings under attendant circumstances.  The ambit or\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 196   Filed 09/24/12   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 5\nextent of counsel’s responsibility is not coterminous with that of the court and where\nCongress has determined in the best interests of national security to limit counsel’s scope\nof inquiry, the court’s vigilance in protecting defendants rights and insuring fairness rises\nto a level of scrutiny.  I have undertaken this ex parte review required by 50 U.S.C. §\n1806 (f) under that standard.  It is the same standard used by the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court (“FISC”), meaning that I may not second-guess the Executive\nBranch’s certification that the surveillance has a foreign intelligence objective.  In re\nGrand Jury Proceedings of the Special April 2002 Grand Jury, 347 F.3d 197, 204-05 (7th\nCir. 2003).  My charge is to conduct a de novo review of the FISA materials to determine\nif the surveillance authorization was based on appropriate probable cause.  If disclosure of\nthe FISA materials is not necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of\nthe collection and if I find the surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted, the\nmotion must be denied.  50 U.S.C. § 1806(g).\nHaving concluded my review under 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), I do not find it necessary\nto disclose any of the documents or orders incident to the FISA applications.  There is no\nindication of any irregularities, misrepresentations of fact, vague identifications of the\npersons involved or any significant amount of non-foreign intelligence data that would\ncall into question adherence to the minimization standards contained in the FISA orders. \nThe attested facts support a finding of probable cause to believe that Defendants\nMuhtorov and Jumaev, the targets of the requested surveillance, were agents of a foreign\npower as defined by statute.  I find the application and attendant affidavits complete and\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 196   Filed 09/24/12   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 5\nin proper form and that as to the one Defendant who is a United States person (for that\nmatter as well the other Defendant who is not a United States person), the certifications\nare not clearly erroneous.\nIn sum, I find that all of the FISA orders and applications concerning these\nDefendants meet the standards set out in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.  While I do not find it\nnecessary in this case to resort to a finding of a “good faith” belief on the part of the\ngovernment agents involved in obtaining the FISA warrants, there is no indication\nwhatever of a lack of such good faith.  Moreover, I find these same persons made a good\nfaith effort at minimizing information concerning United States persons that was acquired\nthrough the surveillance efforts.  Therefore, I conclude the FISA surveillance was\nlawfully authorized and legally conducted.  There is no basis for permitting defense\ncounsel to review the FISA materials and no need to order a Franks hearing.\nFinally, I find no basis for deviating from the near unanimous view that FISA does\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment.  It is conceivable that an argument could be made that\nFISA cannot be used to circumvent the Fourth Amendment because the probable cause\nstandard to obtain a search warrant for a criminal prosecution is more stringent than for a\nFISA order, but that situation does not exist here where the electronic surveillance is\ndirected at the activities of a foreign power and its agents and the criminal prosecution is\nmerely incidental to that dominant purpose. \nFor the reasons stated, Defendant Muhtorov’s Motion to Suppress (Doc. 14) and\nSupplement (Doc. 125), and the Combined FISA-Related Motions of Defendant Jumaev\n4\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 196   Filed 09/24/12   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 5\n(Doc. 157) are DENIED.\nDated September 24, 2012.\ns/John L.

JAMSHID MUHTOROV,\n \nDefendant.\n________________________________________________________________________\nDEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE \nOBTAINED OR DERIVED FROM SURVEILLANCE\nUNDER THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT\nAND MOTION FOR DISCOVERY\n________________________________________________________________________\nThe defendant, Jamshid Muhtorov, through the undersigned, appointed counsel of\nrecord, and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, and the American Civil\nLiberties Union Foundation of Colorado, moves to suppress all evidence obtained or\nderived from surveillance conducted pursuant to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008\n(“FAA”).\nRelated to this, Mr. Muhtorov moves for discovery of evidence concerning the\nmanner in which the FAA was used in the government’s investigation of him.\n1\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 69\nINTRODUCTION\nJamshid Muhtorov is charged with his codefendant, Bakhtiyor Jumaev, in an\nindictment alleging the two men conspired and attempted to provide material support to a\ngroup identified as a terrorist organization. Doc. 50.1 More than two years after his arrest,\nMr. Muhtorov was notified that the government intends to “offer into evidence or\notherwise use or disclose” in these proceedings “information obtained or derived” from\nsurveillance conducted under the FAA. Doc. 457.2 That statute purports to allow the\ngovernment to collect the international communications of U.S. citizens and residents en\nmasse, without probable cause. Publicly available documents make clear that the\ngovernment has implemented the statute’s authority broadly. \nMr. Muhtorov now moves to suppress the fruits of the FAA surveillance on the\ngrounds that the government’s monitoring of his communications under the statute\nviolated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as well as Article III. See 50\nU.S.C. § 1806(g) (providing for suppression of evidence where surveillance was “not\nlawfully authorized or conducted”); United States v. U.S. Dist. Court for the E. Dist. of\nMich., 407 U.S. 297 (1972) (hereafter “Keith”) (warrantless surveillance conducted for\ndomestic security purposes violates Fourth Amendment); Berger v. New York, 388 U.S.\n1 “Doc.” refers to the Clerk’s Docket.\n2       The codefendant, Mr. Jumaev, was not provided similar notice. The issue of whether he\nshould have been, and his standing to raise the same challenges Mr. Muhtorov does here are\nbefore the Court. See Docs. 458, 470, 499, 518.  Should Mr. Jumaev choose to do so, Mr.\nMuhtorov welcomes his adoption of the arguments advanced in this brief. See D.C.Colo.LCr\n12.1 (b).\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 69\n41 (1967) (requiring suppression of evidence obtained in reliance on unconstitutional\neavesdropping statute). \nIn addition, Mr. Muhtorov moves for discovery of material that would be helpful\nand material to his defense, that would permit him to better understand the role that the\nFAA played in the government’s investigation of him, and that would enable him to\nchallenge the specific manner in which the FAA was used in his case. As explained\nbelow, Mr. Muhtorov is entitled to such discovery under both the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act (“FISA”) and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nFACTUAL AND STATUTORY BACKGROUND\nA. Jamshid Muhtorov\nJamshid Muhtorov was born in Jizzak, Uzbekistan, when the country was still\nunder communist rule. He is the oldest of five children. His father, Asror Muhtorov, is a\ndoctor, and his mother, Robiya Muhtorova, was a school teacher. Both still live in\nUzbekistan.\nA few years after graduating from a technical university, Mr. Muhtorov was\noffered a position with the Ezgulik Human Rights Society, a human rights organization in\nUzbekistan. In 2003, he became the head of the Jizzak branch. \nDuring his time with Ezgulik, Mr. Muhtorov worked closely with Human Rights\nWatch, foreign embassies, and NGOs, as a result of which he came under increasing\nscrutiny from the repressive regime of Islam Karimov, who has been in power since the\nbreakup of the Soviet Union. This scrutiny intensified after the Andijon Massacre in May\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 69\n2005, and, in 2006, according to Human Rights Watch reports, led to Mr. Muhtorov being\nthreatened and beaten unconscious. With the help of other activists, Mr. Muhtorov\nescaped from Uzbekistan just ahead of agents of the Karimov regime who were pursuing\nhim. His wife and children followed him shortly afterward, joining him in Kyrgystan.\nIn February 2007, Mr. Muhtorov and his family were admitted to the United States\nas political refugees. He, his wife, Nargiza Muhtorova, and the couple’s two children\nsettled in Colorado. (The couple’s third child was born after they arrived here.) Mr.\nMuhtorov has no criminal record and, before his arrest on the instant charges two years\nago, had never been arrested—except by the Uzbek security police. Today, he is a legal\npermanent resident of the United States.3\n After arriving in Denver, Mr. Muhtorov worked mainly as a truck driver,\nsupporting his family, and repaying the loan made to him by Lutheran Immigration and\nRefugee Services that enabled him and his family to resettle here. He became active with\na local mosque, and continued to follow political developments in Uzbekistan. Until his\narrest in January of 2012, he felt free: free to practice his faith; free to engage in political\ndiscourse; free to express his own views without fear of arrest, physical assault or\nrepression.\n3 See 50 U.S.C. § 1801(I) (defining “United States person” as, among other things, “a\ncitizen of the United States” or “an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence”);\nid.§ 1881(a). This brief will, on occasion, refer to “Americans.”  Where appropriate, this term is\nmeant to include “United States persons.” \n4\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 69\nB. The government’s belated notice of FAA surveillance\nThis case involves numerous intrusive searches of Mr. Muhtorov’s computer,\nemail accounts, private residence, and personal effects. At the outset of the prosecution,\nthe government represented that it had conducted these searches based on “court\nauthorization[s].” Aff. of Donald E. Hale, Special Agent, FBI ¶ 12 (attached to Crim.\nCompl., Doc. 1). On February 7, 2012, the government notified Mr. Muhtorov that it\nintended to “offer into evidence or otherwise use or disclose” in these proceedings\ninformation “information obtained and derived” from surveillance conducted under FISA,\n50 U.S.C. §§ 1801–1811, 1821–1829. Doc. 12. That notice, however, made no mention of\nsurveillance under the FAA.\nMr. Muhtorov did not learn that the government had intercepted his\ncommunications under the FAA until October 25, 2013, twenty months after the\ngovernment’s initial FISA notice. See Doc. 457. This was because, until recently, the\ngovernment had a policy of concealing from criminal defendants any connection between\nthe FAA and their prosecutions. This policy violated both the FAA itself, 50 U.S.C. §§\n1881e(a), 1806(c), and the due process rights of criminal defendants like Mr. Muhtorov.\nThe government’s policy of withholding notice of FAA surveillance came to light\nonly after the Supreme Court decided Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 133 S. Ct.\n1138 (2013), last winter. In that case, the government argued that human rights groups\nand other organizations lacked standing to challenge the FAA’s constitutionality because\nthey could not show a sufficient likelihood that their communications would be monitored\n5\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 69\nunder it. In making that argument, the government assured the Court that dismissing the\ncase would not forever insulate the statute from judicial review. In particular, the\ngovernment stated that it would notify criminal defendants against whom it intended to\nintroduce evidence obtained or derived from FAA surveillance, and that lower courts\nwould have an opportunity to adjudicate the statute’s constitutionality when defendants\nfiled motions to suppress. See Br. of Petitioners 8, Amnesty, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (No. 11-\n1025) (citing 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881e(a), 1806(c)); see also Tr. of Oral Argument at 4:12–17,\nAmnesty, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (No. 11-1025). Relying on the government’s representation,\nAmnesty, 133 S. Ct. at 1154, a divided Court dismissed the case, id. at 1155. \nThough the Solicitor General did not know it at the time, his representation to the\nCourt in Amnesty was untrue. In the five years between the FAA’s enactment and the\nCourt’s consideration of Amnesty, no criminal defendant had received notice of FAA\nsurveillance. In fact, the Justice Department had a practice of concealing from criminal\ndefendants the role that the FAA had played in the government’s investigation of them.4\nThe Solicitor General apparently learned of the Justice Department’s policy only because\nthe Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Dianne Feinstein, made\npublic statements about the government’s use of evidence acquired under the FAA in\ncertain criminal prosecutions, including this one. Those statements led some criminal\n4 On November 21, 2013, three members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\nwrote to the Solicitor General requesting a “formal notification to the Supreme Court of the\ngovernment’s misrepresentations” in Amnesty. See Letter from Sen. Mark Udall, Sen. Ron\nWyden & Sen. Martin Heinrich to Donald Verrilli, Solicitor General (Nov. 20, 2013),\nhttp://1.usa.gov/1knrIRv.\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 69\ndefendants to seek clarification from the government. When he learned of the Justice\nDepartment’s policy, the Solicitor General reportedly concluded that the policy “could\nnot be justified legally.” See Charlie Savage, Door May Open for Challenge to Secret\nWiretaps, N.Y. Times, Oct. 16, 2013, http://nyti.ms/1bAe7QZ. After extended debate\nwithin the executive branch, the Justice Department ultimately changed its policy and\npublicly affirmed its notice obligation. See, e.g., Devlin Barrett, U.S. Spy Program Lifts\nVeil in Court, Wall St. J., July 31, 2013, http://on.wsj.com/19nu8KC.\nIn October of last year, Mr. Muhtorov became the first person charged as a\ndefendant in a criminal prosecution to receive notice of FAA surveillance. See Devlin\nBarrett, U.S. Tells Suspect for First Time It Used NSA Surveillance Program in Criminal\nCase, Wall St. J., Oct. 25, 2013, http://on.wsj.com/16Bv4av. The notice he received\nstates, in relevant part, that the government:\nhereby provides notice to this Court and the defense, pursuant to 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1806(c) and 1881e(a), that the government intends to offer into evidence\nor otherwise use or disclose in proceedings in the above-captioned matter\ninformation obtained or derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence\ninformation conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\nof 1978, as amended, 50 U.S.C. §1881a.\nDoc. 457.\nC. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\nIn 1975, Congress established a committee, chaired by Senator Frank Church, to\ninvestigate allegations of “substantial wrongdoing” by the intelligence agencies in their\nconduct of surveillance. Final Report of the S. Select Comm. to Study Governmental\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 69\nOperations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (Book II), S. Rep. No. 94-755, at v\n(1976) (“Church Report”). The committee discovered that, over the course of four\ndecades, the intelligence agencies had “violated specific statutory prohibitions,”\n“infringed the constitutional rights of American citizens,” and “intentionally disregarded”\nlegal limitations on surveillance in the name of “national security.” Id. at 137. Of\nparticular concern to the committee was that the agencies had “pursued a ‘vacuum\ncleaner’ approach to intelligence collection,” in some cases intercepting Americans’\ncommunications under the pretext of targeting foreigners. Id. at 165. To ensure proper\njudicial involvement in the protection of Americans’ communications, the committee\nrecommended that all surveillance of communications “to, from, or about an American\nwithout his consent” be subject to a judicial warrant procedure. Id. at 309.\nIn 1978, largely in response to the Church Report, Congress enacted FISA to\nregulate government surveillance conducted for foreign intelligence purposes. The statute\ncreated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) and empowered it to grant\nor deny government applications for surveillance orders in certain foreign intelligence\ninvestigations. See 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a). In its current form, FISA regulates, among other\nthings, “electronic surveillance,” which is defined to include:\nthe acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of\nthe contents of any wire communication to or from a person in the United\nStates, without the consent of any party thereto, if such acquisition occurs in\nthe United States.\n50 U.S.C. § 1801(f)(2).\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 69\nBefore passage of the FAA in 2008, FISA generally foreclosed the government\nfrom engaging in “electronic surveillance” without first obtaining an individualized and\nparticularized order from the FISC. To obtain a traditional FISA order, the government is\nrequired to submit an application that identifies or describes the target of the surveillance;\nexplains the government’s basis for believing that “the target of the electronic\nsurveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;” explains the\ngovernment’s basis for believing that “each of the facilities or places at which the\nelectronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power\nor an agent of a foreign power;” and describes the nature of the foreign intelligence\ninformation sought and the type of communications that will be subject to surveillance.\nId. § 1804(a).\nThe FISC may issue a traditional FISA order only if it finds that, among other\nthings, there is “probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance\n[was] a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,” id. § 1805(a)(2)(A), and “each of\nthe facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is\nabout to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,” id. § 1805(a)(2)(B). \nD. The warrantless wiretapping program\nOn October 4, 2001, President George W. Bush secretly authorized the NSA to\nengage in warrantless electronic surveillance inside the United States.5 After The New\n5 See Public Declaration of James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence (“DNI”) ¶\n6, Jewel v. NSA, No. 08-cv-04373 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2013), Doc. 168 (“Clapper Jewel Decl.”).\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 69\nYork Times exposed the program and a federal district court ruled that the program was\nunconstitutional, ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d 754 (E.D. Mich. 2006), the government\nstated that the program would not be reauthorized in its then-existing form. The\ngovernment ultimately sought legislative amendments to FISA that granted authorities\nbeyond what FISA had allowed for three decades.6 \nE. The FISA Amendments Act \nThe legislative amendments sought by the Bush administration were embodied in\nthe FAA, which was signed into law on July 10, 2008.7 The FAA substantially revised the\nFISA regime and authorized the acquisition without individualized suspicion of a wide\nswath of communications, including U.S. persons’ international communications, from\ninternet and telecommunications providers inside the United States. Like surveillance\nunder FISA, FAA surveillance takes place on U.S. soil. But the authority granted by the\nFAA is altogether different from, and far more sweeping than, the authority that the\ngovernment has traditionally exercised under FISA. The FAA’s implications for U.S.\npersons’ constitutional rights are correspondingly far-reaching. Because Mr. Muhtorov\ncontests the lawfulness of the government’s surveillance of him under the FAA, it is\nnecessary to describe the statute in some detail. \n6 See id.; see also Strengthening FISA: Does the Protect America Act Protect Americans’\nCivil Liberties and Enhance Security?: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 110th\nCong. (2007) (statement of J. Michael McConnell, DNI), http://1.usa.gov/1kb6c26.\n7 On August 5, 2007, Congress passed a predecessor statute, the Protect America Act, Pub.\nL. No. 110-55, 121 Stat. 552 (2007), whose authorities expired in February 2008.\n10\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 69\nThe FAA allows the government to conduct dragnet surveillance of international\ncommunications entering or leaving the United States, including communications sent or\nreceived by U.S. persons. It does this by permitting the government to intercept\ncommunications when at least one party to a phone call or email is a foreigner located\nabroad. In particular, the FAA permits the Attorney General and DNI to “authorize\njointly, for a period of up to 1 year . . . the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be\nlocated outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information.” 50 U.S.C.\n§1881a(a).\nNo court ever approves the target of this surveillance. Rather, the FISC approves\nonly the general procedures the government proposes to use in carrying out its\nsurveillance and, on the basis of those procedures alone, the FISC issues a so-called\n“mass-acquisition order.” See id. § 1881a. Before obtaining such an order, the Attorney\nGeneral and DNI must provide to the FISC a written certification attesting that the FISC\nhas approved, or that the government has submitted to the FISC for approval, both\n“targeting procedures” and “minimization procedures.” Id. § 1881a(d)–(g). The targeting\nprocedures must be “reasonably designed” to ensure the acquisition is “limited to\ntargeting persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States” and to\n“prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all\nintended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United\nStates.” Id. § 1881a(g)(2)(A)(I). The minimization procedures must meet the\nrequirements of section 1801(h), 1821(4). Id. § 1881a(g)(2)(A)(ii). \n11\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 69\nFinally, the certification and supporting affidavit must attest that the Attorney\nGeneral has adopted “guidelines” to prevent the targeting of U.S. persons in certain\ncontexts, id. § 1881a(b); that the targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and\nguidelines are consistent with the Fourth Amendment; and that “a significant purpose” of\nthe acquisition is “to obtain foreign intelligence information.” Id. §\n1881a(g)(2)(A)(iii)–(vii). The phrase “foreign intelligence information” is defined\nbroadly to include, among other things, information concerning terrorism, national\ndefense, and foreign affairs. Id. § 1801(e).\nA crucial difference between the FAA and traditional FISA is that the FAA\nauthorizes surveillance not predicated on probable cause or individualized suspicion.\nWhen the government makes an FAA application to the FISC, it simply asks the court to\napprove the overall targeting and minimization procedures that will guide the\ngovernment’s surveillance for the following year. The government need not demonstrate\nto the FISC that its surveillance targets are agents of foreign powers, engaged in criminal\nactivity, or connected even remotely with terrorism. Rather, the FAA permits the\ngovernment to target any foreigner located outside the United States. See David S. Kris &\nJ. Douglas Wilson, 1 National Security Investigations and Prosecutions § 17.3, 602 (2d\ned. 2012) (“For non–U.S. person targets, there is no probable cause requirement; the only\nthing that matters is []the government’s reasonable belief about[] the target’s location.”).\nAs noted, the FAA does not require the government to identify its surveillance\ntargets to the FISC at all, or even to identify the specific “facilities, places, premises, or\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 69\nproperty at which” its surveillance will be directed. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(g)(4). This means\nthat the government can “direct surveillance . . . at various facilities without obtaining a\nseparate authorization for each one.” Kris & Wilson § 17.3, 602. The government may\neven direct its surveillance at “gateway” switches, through which flow the\ncommunications of millions of people, rather than at individual telephone lines or email\naddresses. Id. § 16.12, 577. The FISC reported that in 2011—the year in which much of\nthe government’s surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov apparently took place—the NSA relied\non the FAA to collect more than 250 million internet communications. See [Redacted],\n2011 WL 10945618, at *10 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011).\nBy dispensing with FISA’s principal limitations, the FAA exposes every\ninternational communication—that is, every communication between an individual in the\nUnited States and a non-American abroad—to potential surveillance. Indeed, this was the\nstatute’s purpose. In advocating changes to FISA, intelligence officials made clear that\ntheir aim was to enable broader surveillance of communications between individuals\ninside the United States and non-Americans abroad. See FISA for the 21st Century:\nHearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 9 (2006),\nhttp://1.usa.gov/1kbgHm3 (statement of NSA Director Michael Hayden) (“Hayden SJC\nStatement”) (stating, with respect to the FAA’s predecessor statute, that certain\ncommunications “with one end . . . in the United States” are the ones “that are most\nimportant to us”). As a result, the government can once again conduct the kind of\nvacuum-cleaner–style surveillance that the Church Committee found so troubling. And,\n13\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 69\nas discussed further below, the NSA is using the statute to do precisely this. \nTo the extent the statute attempts to provide safeguards for U.S. residents’\nconstitutional rights, the safeguards take the form of “minimization procedures,” which\nmust be “reasonably designed . . . to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit\nthe dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United\nStates persons.” 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h)(1), 1821(4)(A). The statute’s minimization\nrequirement is supposed to protect against the collection, retention, and dissemination of\ncommunications that have been collected “incidentally” or “inadvertently.” However, the\nstatute does not prescribe specific minimization procedures and it does not give the FISC\nthe authority to monitor compliance with minimization procedures. Most significantly, it\nincludes an exception that specifically allows the government to retain and disseminate\ncommunications—including those of U.S. persons—if the government concludes that\nthey contain “foreign intelligence information,” a term that is (as noted above) defined\nvery broadly. Id. § 1881a(e). In other words, the statute is designed to allow the\ngovernment not just to collect but to retain U.S. persons’ international communications.\nThe FISC’s oversight role in authorizing and supervising FAA surveillance is\n“narrowly circumscribed.” In re Proceedings Required by § 702(I) of the FISA\nAmendments Act of 2008, No. Misc. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *2 (FISC Aug. 27,\n2008) (quotation marks omitted). Unlike the judiciary’s traditional Fourth Amendment\nrole—as a gatekeeper for particular acts of surveillance—the FISC simply approves\nvague parameters under which the government is free to conduct surveillance for up to\n14\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 69\none year. The FISC does not consider individualized and particularized surveillance\napplications, does not make individualized probable cause determinations, and does not\nsupervise the implementation of the government’s targeting or minimization procedures.\nThe role that the FISC plays under the FAA bears no resemblance to the role that it\ntraditionally played under FISA.\nF. The government’s implementation of the FISA Amendments Act\nNothing in the government’s implementation of the statute cures or even mitigates\nthe statute’s significant defects. To the contrary, publicly available versions of the\ngovernment’s targeting and minimization procedures only confirm that the rules that\nsupposedly protect privacy are weak and riddled with exceptions.8 Even when the\ngovernment abides by the rules, the government collects thousands, possibly millions, of\nU.S. residents’ communications without probable cause or individualized suspicion.9 And\n8 While the government has officially disclosed a version of the minimization procedures it\nuses to implement the FAA, see Minimization Procedures Used by National Security Agency in\nConnection with Acquisitions of Foreign Intelligence Information Pursuant to Section 702 of the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as Amended (Oct. 31, 2011),\nhttp://1.usa.gov/1e2JsAv (“2011 Minimization Procedures”), it has not officially disclosed its\ntargeting procedures. It has, however, made several disclosures that reveal its targeting\nprocedures in broad outlines. See generally [Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618. Moreover, in June\n2013, The Guardian revealed a copy of the FAA targeting procedures approved by the FISC in\n2009. See Procedures Used by the National Security Agency for Targeting Non–United States\nPersons Reasonably Believed to Be Located Outside the United States to Acquire Foreign\nIntelligence Information Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of\n1978, As Amended (July 28, 2009),\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/716633/exhibit-a.pdf (“2009\nTargeting Procedures”).\n9 See Barton Gellman & Laura Poitras, U.S., British Intelligence Mining Data from Nine\nU.S. Internet Companies in Broad Secret Program, Wash.

See [Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *2–*9.\nPublicly available versions of the government’s targeting procedures underscore\nthe scope of the surveillance carried out under the statute. As noted above, one of the\nstatute’s principal purposes was to permit the government to conduct dragnet surveillance\nof U.S. persons’ international communications. The procedures give effect to that intent\nby permitting the government to collect U.S. persons’ international communications in\nthe course of warrantless surveillance directed at targets outside the United States. See,\ne.g., 2009 Targeting Procedures 6 (discussing need to prevent acquisition only of\ncommunications “as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time\nof acquisition to be located in the United States”). Indeed, the procedures ensure that U.S.\npersons’ international communications will be collected in bulk. For example, while the\nprocedures require the government to identify “targets” outside the country, once the\ntargets have been identified, the procedures permit the NSA to sweep up not just any\ncommunications to and from those targets but any international communication about\nthose targets. See 2009 Targeting Procedures 1 (discussing “those cases where NSA seeks\nto acquire communications about the target that are not to or from the target”); see also\n[Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *5.\nsingled out for targeting, the NSA routinely collects a great deal of American content.”).\n16\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 69\nNews reports discuss this kind of surveillance—sometimes called “about”\nsurveillance—in more detail. An August 2013 report from The New York Times states that\nthe NSA is “searching the contents of vast amounts of Americans’ e-mail and text\ncommunications into and out of the country, hunting for people who mention information\nabout foreigners under surveillance, according to intelligence officials.” Charlie Savage,\nNSA Said to Search Content of Messages to and From U.S., N.Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2013,\nhttp://nyti.ms/1cez5ZK. The report continues: “While it has long been known that the\nagency conducts extensive computer searches of data it vacuums up overseas, that it is\nsystematically searching—without warrants—through the contents of Americans’\ncommunications that cross the border reveals more about the scale of its secret\noperations.” Id. \nThus, even when the government abides by its rules, it collects huge volumes of\nU.S. residents’ international communications without any of the safeguards the\nConstitution ordinarily requires. Moreover, the minimization procedures place no\nmeaningful limit on the government’s authority to retain, analyze, and disseminate these\ncommunications. See, e.g., 2011 Minimization Procedures §§ 3(b), 6 (permitting the\ngovernment to retain communications to, from, or about U.S. persons for five years, or\nindefinitely if they contain “foreign intelligence information” or evidence of a crime).\nEven purely domestic communications can be retained indefinitely if the government\nconcludes that they contain foreign intelligence information. Id. § 5. \n17\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 69\nThe minimization procedures also permit the government to conduct warrantless\nsearches in its database of communications collected under the FAA, including by using\nsearch terms or identifiers (names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.) associated with\nU.S. persons.10 These kinds of searches—“backdoor searches”—are an end-run around\nthe Fourth Amendment. See James Ball & Spencer Ackerman, NSA Loophole Allows\nWarrantless Search for US Citizens’ Emails and Phone Calls, Guardian, Aug. 9, 2013,\nhttp://gu.com/p/3tva4 (“Senator Ron Wyden told the Guardian that the law provides\nthe NSA with a loophole potentially allowing ‘warrantless searches for the phone calls or\nemails of law-abiding Americans’”). A presidential review group recently recommended\nending the practice of backdoor searches, concluding that the practice violates the “full\nprotection of [Americans’] privacy.” See President’s Review Group on Intelligence &\nCommunications Technologies, Liberty and Security in a Changing World 149, 145–50\n(Dec. 12, 2013), http://1.usa.gov/1be3wsO. \n10 These kinds of searches were once prohibited by the government’s minimization\nprocedures, but the prohibition was lifted in 2011.

The role that the FAA played in the government’s investigation of Mr.\nMuhtorov\nThe FAA notice in this case was filed belatedly, and only after the government\nreversed its existing policy of depriving criminal defendants of notice under the statute.\nThe notice supplies no information beyond the bare fact that the government intends to\nintroduce or otherwise use information obtained or derived through use of the FAA. Thus,\nwhile it is plain that the FAA played a key role in the government’s investigation of Mr.\nMuhtorov, the government has not provided Mr. Muhtorov with information that is\ncrucial to his defense.11 \nFor example, the government has not told Mr. Muhtorov which communications it\nobtained under the FAA, when they were obtained, and whether they were used as the\nbasis for subsequent warrant applications. It has not provided Mr. Muhtorov with its\nsurveillance applications, the affidavits submitted in connection with those applications,\nor the FISC orders that granted those applications. It has not told Mr. Muhtorov which\ntargeting and minimization procedures applied at the time his communications were\ncollected; nor has it provided him with documents, including FISC orders, relating to the\ngovernment’s compliance or non-compliance with those procedures. Nor, finally, has it\ntold Mr. Muhtorov which selectors, search terms, or filters were applied to information\n11 Discovery provided by the government thus far suggests that the government began\nintercepting Mr. Muhtorov’s email communications no later than January 2011. The earliest\ncommunication provided to the defense is a January 29, 2011 email exchange between an\naccount associated with Mr. Muhtorov and an account that is allegedly linked to the Islamic\nJihad Union. The earliest cell-phone interception of which the defense is aware was on March 8,\n2011, purportedly a call between Mr. Muhtorov and the codefendant, Mr. Jumaev. \n19\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 69\ncollected in bulk such that the government’s attention became focused on him.\nTo be clear, and as explained at greater length below, Mr. Muhtorov believes that\nthe government’s surveillance of him was unlawful for the simple fact that it was carried\nout under a statute that is procedurally defective—that is, because it was carried out under\na statute that fails to comply with the Fourth Amendment’s most basic requirements. But\nboth FISA and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment entitle Mr. Muhtorov to\nmore information about how, precisely, the FAA was used to collect his communications,\nhow the communications collected under the statute were used in the government’s\ninvestigation of him, and in which ways the evidence they propose to use in the instant\nprosecution is tainted by the government’s violation of his constitutional rights. \nARGUMENT\nI. The evidence obtained or derived from surveillance under the FAA must be\nsuppressed because the FAA is unconstitutional.\nThe fruits of the government’s surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov must be suppressed\nbecause the statute that authorized the surveillance is unconstitutional. The FAA violates\nthe Fourth Amendment because it authorizes surveillance that violates the warrant clause\nand, independently, because it authorizes surveillance that is unreasonable. The statute\nalso violates Article III by requiring judges to issue advisory opinions in the absence of a\ncase or controversy. The procedural deficiencies of the FAA render the statute\nunconstitutional, and they render the surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov unconstitutional as\nwell. See Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 59 (1968) (“No search . . . is valid” if\n20\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 69\nauthorized by a statute whose “procedural safeguards” are “inadequate to ensure the sort\nof neutral contemplation by a magistrate of the grounds for the search and its proposed\nscope.” (citing Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967)); Bond v. United States, 131 S.\nCt. 2355 (2011).12 All evidence obtained or derived from the unlawful surveillance\nconducted under the statute —that is, all evidence obtained directly or indirectly from the\nstatute’s use—must be suppressed. See 50 U.S.C. § 1806(g).\nA. The FAA violates the Fourth Amendment.\nThe FAA gives the government nearly unfettered access to U.S. persons’\ninternational communications. Whereas FISA authorizes the government to conduct\nrelatively narrow surveillance of foreign agents and foreign powers, the FAA permits the\ngovernment to monitor any international communication without a warrant so long as the\ntarget of its surveillance is a foreigner abroad and a significant purpose of its surveillance\nis to acquire foreign intelligence information. In effect, the statute allows the government\nto acquire essentially any communication that originates or terminates outside the United\nStates.\nThe statute violates the warrant clause because it allows the government to monitor\nU.S. persons’ international communications without obtaining prior judicial approval\n12 See Berger, 388 U.S. at 58 (invalidating an electronic surveillance statute that lacked\n“precise and discriminate” procedural requirements “carefully circumscribed so as to prevent\nunauthorized invasions” of privacy); see also, e.g., Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997)\n(invalidating state statute requiring candidates for state office to undergo warrantless and\nsuspicionless drug tests); Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980) (invalidating state statute\nauthorizing warrantless entry into homes); Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465 (1979)\n(invalidating state statute permitting warrantless and suspicionless searches of luggage).\n21\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 69\nbased upon probable cause, and without describing the communications to be obtained\nwith particularity. It also violates the reasonableness requirement. The Supreme Court has\nemphasized that a surveillance statute is reasonable only if it is precise and discriminate.\nThe FAA is anything but.\n1. Mr. Muhtorov had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his\ninternational communications.\nAmerican citizens and residents—including Mr. Muhtorov—have a\nconstitutionally protected privacy interest in the content of their telephone calls and\nemails. United States v. Katz, 389 U.S. 347, 353 (1967); see also Keith, 407 U.S. at 313\n(“[Katz] implicitly recognized that the broad and unsuspected governmental incursions\ninto conversational privacy which electronic surveillance entails necessitate the\napplication of Fourth Amendment safeguards.”); Alderman v.

Indeed, as the Supreme Court noted in Berger, “[f]ew threats to liberty exist\nwhich are greater than that posed by the use of eavesdropping devices,” 388 U.S. at 63. In\ninvalidating the New York surveillance statute before it, the Court wrote: “[I]t is not\nasking too much that officers be required to comply with the basic command of the\nFourth Amendment before the innermost secrets of one’s home or office are invaded.” Id.\nat 63. \n22\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 69\nThe Fourth Amendment’s protection extends not just to domestic communications\nbut to international ones as well. See, e.g., United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606, 616–20\n(1977); see also Defs.’ Mem. in Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. 48, Amnesty Int’l USA\nv. McConnell, 646 F. Supp. 2d 633 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (No. 08 Civ. 6259) (not contesting\nthat Fourth Amendment protects privacy of U.S. persons’ international communications). \n2. The FAA permits surveillance of U.S. persons’ international\ncommunications in violation of the warrant requirement.\na. The FAA authorizes “general searches.” \nThe Fourth Amendment requires that search warrants be issued only “upon\nprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to\nbe searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The Supreme Court has interpreted\nthese words to require three things: (1) that any warrant be issued by a neutral,\ndisinterested magistrate; (2) that those seeking the warrant demonstrate to the magistrate\nthere is probable cause to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a particular\napprehension or conviction for a particular offense; and (3) that any warrant particularly\ndescribe the things to be seized as well as the place to be searched. See Dalia v. United\nStates, 441 U.S. 238, 255 (1979). \nThe FAA authorizes the executive branch to conduct electronic surveillance\nwithout complying with any of these three requirements; accordingly, the statute is\npresumptively unconstitutional. See Katz, 389 U.S. at 357 (Warrantless searches are “per\nse unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment—subject only to a few specifically\n23\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 69\nestablished and well-delineated exceptions.”); accord Payton, 445 U.S. 573; Chimel v.\nCalifornia, 395 U.S. 752, 768 (1969). \nFirst, the FAA fails to interpose “the deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial\nofficer . . . between the citizen and the police.” Katz, 389 U.S. at 357 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). While the government may not initiate an acquisition under the FAA\nwithout first applying for a mass-acquisition order from the FISC (or obtaining such an\norder within seven days of initiating the acquisition), the FISC’s role is solely to review\ngeneral procedures relating to targeting and minimization. Every decision relevant to the\nsurveillance of specific targets is made by executive officers and never presented to the\nFISC. Indeed, nothing in the FAA requires the government even to inform the FISC who\nits surveillance targets are (beyond to say that the targets are outside the United States),\nwhat the purpose of its surveillance is (beyond to say that a “significant purpose” of its\nyear-long program of surveillance is to gather foreign intelligence), or which, or how\nmany, U.S. persons are likely to be implicated by the acquisition. Compare with 18\nU.S.C. § 2518(1)(b) (requiring government’s application for Title III warrant to include\ndetails of the particular offense that has been committed, a description of the nature and\nlocation of facilities to be monitored, a description of the type of communications to be\nintercepted, and the identity of the individual to be monitored); 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)\n(setting out similar requirements for FISA orders). \nThe Fourth Amendment reflects a judgment that “[t]he right of privacy [is] too\nprecious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the\n24\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 69\narrest of criminals,” McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 455–56 (1948), but this is\nprecisely what the FAA does: It entrusts to the unreviewed discretion of the executive\nbranch decisions that affect the privacy rights of countless U.S. persons.\nSecond, the FAA fails to condition government surveillance on the existence of\nprobable cause. It permits the government to conduct acquisitions without proving to a\ncourt that its surveillance targets are foreign agents, engaged in criminal activity, or\nconnected even remotely with terrorism. Compare with 18 U.S.C. § 2518(3) (Title III\nprobable cause requirement); 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2) (corresponding provision for FISA).\nIt permits the government to conduct acquisitions without even making an administrative\ndetermination that its targets fall into any of these categories. \nIt is important to recognize that the absence of an individualized suspicion\nrequirement has ramifications for U.S. persons like Mr. Muhtorov even though the\ngovernment’s ostensible targets are foreign citizens outside the United States. The\nabsence of an individualized suspicion requirement means that the government can\nengage in the wholesale collection of U.S. persons’ international communications—that it\ncan, for example, intentionally collect all communications between the New York and\nLondon offices of Amnesty International, or all communications between Human Rights\nWatch in New York and human rights researchers in South and Central Asia. In fact,\nunder the FAA the government could collect all communications between New York and\nLondon so long as the nominal targets for this mass acquisition were non-U.S. persons\nbelieved to be in the United Kingdom.\n25\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 69\nThird, the FAA fails to restrict the government’s surveillance authority to matters\ndescribed with particularity. The requirement of particularity “is especially great in the\ncase of eavesdropping,” as eavesdropping inevitably results in the interception of intimate\nconversations that are unrelated to the investigation. Berger, 388 U.S. at 56. Unlike Title\nIII and FISA, however, the FAA does not require the government to identify the\nindividuals to be monitored. Compare with 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(b)(iv) (Title III); 50\nU.S.C. § 1804(a)(2) (FISA). It does not require the government to identify the facilities,\ntelephone lines, email addresses, places, premises, or property at which its surveillance\nwill be directed. Compare with 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(b)(ii) (Title III); 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1804(a)(3)(b) (FISA). It does not limit the kinds of communications the government can\nacquire, beyond requiring that a programmatic purpose of the government’s surveillance\nbe to gather foreign intelligence. Compare with 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6) (allowing\nissuance of FISA order only upon certification that a significant purpose of the specific\nintercept is to obtain foreign intelligence information). It does not require the government\nto identify “the particular conversations to be seized,” United States v. Donovan, 429 U.S.\n413, 427 n.15 (1977). Compare with 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(b)(iii) (Title III); 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1804(a)(6) (FISA). Nor, finally, does it place any reasonable limit on the duration of\nmass-acquisition orders. Compare 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a) (allowing surveillance programs\nto continue for up to one year), with 50 U.S.C. § 1805(d)(1) (providing that surveillance\norders issued under FISA are generally limited to 90 or 120 days), and 18 U.S.C. §\n2518(5) (providing that surveillance orders issued under Title III are limited to 30 days).\n26\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 69\nThe FAA simply does not ensure that surveillance conducted under the Act “will be\ncarefully tailored.” Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987). \nb. There is no special needs exception to the warrant\nrequirement for foreign intelligence gathering.\nNo “special needs” exception to the warrant requirement applies to the\nsurveillance conducted under the FAA. Even if the foreign intelligence context may\njustify a modification to the probable cause requirement (as some courts have held with\nrespect to traditional FISA), it does not justify abandoning altogether that requirement.\nCourts have recognized an exception to the warrant requirement “in those exceptional\ncircumstances in which special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make\nthe warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable.” New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469\nU.S. 325, 351 (1985) (Blackmun, J., concurring); see Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868,\n873 (1987) (adopting Justice Blackmun’s “special needs” formulation for the Court). The\nmere fact that the government’s surveillance is conducted for foreign intelligence\npurposes, however, does not render the warrant and probable cause requirement\nunworkable. \nAny discussion of the lawfulness of warrantless intelligence surveillance must\nbegin with Keith, 407 U.S. 297, in which the Supreme Court addressed the lawfulness of\nwarrantless surveillance conducted by the FBI against individuals eventually charged\nwith having planned or carried out the bombing of a CIA office in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nIn that case, the government argued that the warrantless surveillance was lawful because\n27\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 69\nit had been conducted for intelligence purposes rather than law enforcement purposes.\nThe Court emphatically disagreed. Addressing the government’s effort to distinguish\nintelligence surveillance from law enforcement surveillance, the Court wrote that\n“[o]fficial surveillance, whether its purpose be criminal investigation or ongoing\nintelligence gathering, risks infringement of constitutionally protected privacy of speech.”\nId. at 320. Addressing the government’s claim that security matters would be “too subtle\nand complex for judicial evaluation,” it observed that the judiciary “regularly deal[s] with\nthe most difficult issues of our society” and that there was “no reason to believe that\nfederal judges [would] be insensitive to or uncomprehending of the issues involved in\ndomestic security cases.” Id. Finally, addressing the government’s contention that the\nwarrant requirement would “fracture the secrecy essential to official intelligence\ngathering,” the Court noted that the judiciary had experience dealing with sensitive and\nconfidential matters and that in any event warrant-application proceedings were ordinarily\nex parte. Id. at 320–21. \nKeith involved surveillance directed at domestic security threats, but its logic\napplies with equal force to surveillance directed at threats with a foreign nexus—at least\nwhen that surveillance sweeps up U.S. persons’ communications (as surveillance\nconducted under the FAA does), and is conducted inside the United States (as\nsurveillance conducted under the FAA is). See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494\nU.S. 259, 278 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (concluding that a warrant was not\nrequired for the search of a non-resident alien’s home in Mexico but stating that “[i]f the\n28\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 69\nsearch had occurred in a residence within the United States, I have little doubt that the full\nprotections of the Fourth Amendment would apply”); see also H.R. Rep. No. 110-373(I),\nat 15 n.26 (2007) (“In judging the ‘reasonableness’ of [a] search, however, the location of\nthe intercept can be as important as the location of the U.S. person under surveillance.”\n(citing Verdugo-Urqidez, 494 U.S. at 278 (Kennedy, J., concurring)).\nFirst, intelligence surveillance conducted inside the United States presents the\nsame risks to “constitutionally protected privacy of speech” whether the asserted threats\nare foreign or domestic. Both forms of surveillance can produce the “indiscriminate\nwiretapping and bugging of law-abiding citizens” that the Keith Court feared. See Keith,\n407 U.S. at 320–21; see also S. Rep. No. 95-701 at 15, reprinted at 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n3973, 3984 (stating Senate Intelligence Committee’s judgment that the arguments in favor\nof prior judicial review “apply with even greater force to foreign counterintelligence\nsurveillance”). The risks are still greater if, as under the FAA, there is no requirement that\nthe government’s surveillance activities be directed at specific foreign agents, or subject\nto individualized judicial review.\nSecond, the courts are just as capable of overseeing foreign intelligence\nsurveillance of U.S. persons’ communications as they are of overseeing domestic\nintelligence surveillance of their communications. Indeed, for the past thirty-five years,\nthe courts have been overseeing intelligence surveillance relating to agents of foreign\npowers because, since its enactment in 1978, FISA has required the government to obtain\nindividualized judicial authorization—based on probable cause that the target is an agent\n29\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 69\nof a foreign power—before conducting foreign intelligence surveillance inside the\nnation’s borders. There is nothing unworkable about FISA’s core requirement of judicial\nauthorization. Since 1978, the FISC has granted more than 33,000 surveillance\napplications submitted by the executive branch, and the government has brought dozens\nof prosecutions based on evidence obtained through FISA. See, e.g., Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act Orders 1979–2012, Elec. Privacy Info Ctr., http://bit.ly/LoZqZG; FISA\nAnnual Reports to Congress 1979–2007, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Fed’n of\nAm. Scis. http://bit.ly/1cvnUef; United States v. Sattar, 2003 WL 22137012, at *6\n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2003) (collecting cases). The country’s experience with FISA shows\nalso that judicial oversight can operate without compromising the secrecy that is\nnecessary in the intelligence context.\nThus, there is no basis to conclude that the warrant and probable cause requirement\nis unworkable here. Moreover, other factors weigh against recognizing a special needs\nexception to the warrant requirement in this context. Most significantly, special needs\nexceptions have generally been recognized only in contexts in which the search in\nquestion was minimally intrusive and the discretion of executive officers was strictly\nconfined. See, e.g., Skinner v. Railway Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 624 (1989).\nThis is not such a context. Surveillance under the FAA is exceptionally intrusive, and it is\nconducted by executive officers who enjoy broad authority to decide whom to monitor,\nwhen, and for how long. \n30\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 69\nc. Even if a foreign intelligence exception to the warrant\nrequirement exists, it is not broad enough to make the\nFAA constitutional.\nEven if the government’s need to gather intelligence about security threats with a\nforeign nexus constitutes a special need justifying an exception to the warrant\nrequirement, any such exception is not broad enough to render FAA surveillance\nconstitutional. \nFollowing Keith, the circuit courts split on the question of whether warrantless\nsurveillance for foreign intelligence purposes could ever be constitutional. While the\nTenth Circuit has never addressed the question, the D.C. Circuit has suggested that a\nwarrant should be required even for foreign intelligence surveillance directed at suspected\nforeign powers and agents. Zweibon v. Mitchell, 516 F.2d 594, 614 (D.C. Cir. 1975)\n(stating in dicta that “we believe that an analysis of the policies implicated by foreign\nsecurity surveillance indicates that, absent exigent circumstances, all warrantless\nelectronic surveillance is unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional”); see Berlin\nDemocratic Club v. Rumsfeld, 410 F. Supp. 144, 159 (D.D.C. 1976). Several other circuit\ncourts have held that warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes is\nconstitutional in some circumstances. See, e.g., United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629\nF.2d 908, 912–15 (4th Cir. 1980); United States v. Buck, 548 F.2d 871, 875 (9th Cir.\n1977); United States v. Butenko, 494 F.2d 593, 604–05 (3d Cir. 1974); United States v.\nBrown, 484 F.2d 418, 426 (5th Cir. 1973). Crucially, however, all these cases involved\nsurveillance conducted before the enactment of FISA in 1978, and FISA seriously\n31\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 69\nundermines their rationale. See United States v. Bin Laden, 126 F. Supp. 2d 264, 272, 274\nnn.8–9 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). As discussed above, FISA demonstrates that the mere fact that\nthe government’s surveillance is conducted for foreign intelligence purposes does not\nrender the warrant and probable cause requirements unworkable.\nPerhaps more important here, the courts that recognized a foreign intelligence\nexception to the warrant requirement have defined that exception very narrowly. They\nexcused the government from compliance with the warrant requirement only where the\nsurveillance in question was directed at a specific foreign agent or foreign power. See,\ne.g., Truong, 629 F.2d at 915–16; United States v. Ehrlichman, 546 F.2d 910, 925 (D.C.\nCir. 1976); Bin Laden, 126 F. Supp. 2d at 277. They required that the government’s\n“primary purpose” be to gather foreign intelligence information. See, e.g., Truong, 629\nF.2d at 916. And they required that the surveillance be personally approved by the\nPresident or Attorney General. See, e.g., Ehrlichman, 546 F.2d at 926 (“Unless carefully\ncircumscribed, such a power is easily subject to abuse.”); Bin Laden, 126 F. Supp. 2d at\n277. \nThe FAA contains none of these limitations—it permits warrantless surveillance in\ncircumstances far removed from those that have previously been held to fall within the\nforeign intelligence exception. Surveillance under the FAA is not directed only at foreign\npowers and their agents; FAA surveillance operates at a wholesale level, allowing the\ngovernment to collect and search the international communications of U.S. persons in\nbulk. Nor does the FAA require that warrantless surveillance be personally approved by\n32\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 69\nthe President or the Attorney General. The Attorney General has a role in authorizing\nFAA surveillance, but this role involves approval of the overall procedures, not individual\ntargets. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a. \nNor, finally, does the FAA require that the government’s “primary purpose” be to\ncollect foreign intelligence information. To the contrary, it allows the government to\nengage in warrantless surveillance even when its primary purpose is to gather evidence of\ncriminal activity rather than to collect foreign intelligence information. See 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1881a(g)(2)(A)(v) (permitting warrantless surveillance where gathering foreign\nintelligence information is simply a “significant purpose” of the interception). The\npossibility that FAA surveillance will be coopted for ordinary law enforcement\nsurveillance is particularly acute, because the statute’s “significant purpose” requirement\nonly attaches at the broad, programmatic level. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(g)(2)(A)(v).\nUnlike under FISA, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(5), 1805(c)(1)(C), the government is not\nrequired to have a significant foreign intelligence purpose focused on the specific targets\nand facilities it ultimately chooses to monitor. \n3. The FAA violates the Fourth Amendment’s requirement of\nreasonableness.\nThe FAA would be unconstitutional even if the warrant clause were inapplicable\nbecause “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness”—a test the\nFAA fails. See Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006) (quotation marks\nomitted). The reasonableness requirement applies even where the warrant requirement\n33\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 69\ndoes not. United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 539 (1985); see In re\nSealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 737 (FISCR 2002) (assessing reasonableness of FISA);\nFigueroa, 757 F.2d 466, 471–73 (2d Cir. 1985) (Title III); United States v. Duggan, 743\nF.2d 59, 73–74 (2d Cir. 1984) (assessing reasonableness of FISA); United States v.\nTortorello, 480 F.2d 764, 772–73 (2d Cir. 1973) (Title III). Reasonableness is determined\nby examining the “totality of circu[m]stances” to “assess[], on the one hand, the degree to\nwhich [government conduct] intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and, on the other, the\ndegree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.”\nSamson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 848 (2006) (quotation marks omitted); see also\nVirginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 169–70 (2008). \nIn the context of electronic surveillance, reasonableness requires that government\neavesdropping be “precise and discriminate” and “carefully circumscribed so as to\nprevent unauthorized invasions of privacy.” Berger, 388 U.S. at 58 (quotation marks\nomitted); see United States v. Bobo, 477 F.2d 974, 980 (4th Cir. 1973) (“[W]e must\nlook . . . to the totality of the circumstances and the overall impact of the statute to see if\nit authorizes indiscriminate and irresponsible use of electronic surveillance or if it\nauthorizes a reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.”). Courts that have assessed\nthe lawfulness of electronic surveillance have looked to FISA and Title III as measures of\nreasonableness. See, e.g., United States v. Mesa-Rincon, 911 F.2d 1433, 1438 (10th Cir.\n1990) (evaluating reasonableness of video surveillance); United States v. Biasucci, 786\n.2d 504, 510 (2d Cir. 1986) (same); United States v. Torres, 751 F.2d 875, 884 (7th Cir.\n34\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 69\n1984) (same). While the constitutional limitations on foreign intelligence surveillance\nmay differ in some respects from those applicable to law enforcement surveillance, see\nKeith, 407 U.S. at 323–24, “the closer [the challenged] procedures are to Title III\nprocedures, the lesser are [the] constitutional concerns,” In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at\n737. \na. The FAA exposes every U.S. person’s international\ncommunications to the possibility of warrantless\nsurveillance.\nBy abandoning the core requirements of the warrant clause—individualized\nsuspicion, prior judicial review, and particularity—the FAA eliminates the primary\nprotections against general surveillance. Whereas both FISA and Title III require the\ngovernment to identify to a court its targets and the facilities it intends to monitor, the\nFAA does not. Whereas both FISA and Title III require the government to demonstrate\nindividualized suspicion to a court, the FAA does not. (Indeed, the FAA does not require\neven an administrative finding of individualized suspicion.) And, whereas both FISA and\nTitle III impose strict limitations on the nature of the communications that the\ngovernment may monitor and the duration of its surveillance, the FAA does not. The\nFAA’s failure to include these basic safeguards is fatal, because these are the very\nsafeguards that the courts have cited in upholding the constitutionality of both FISA and\nTitle III. See, e.g., Duggan, 743 F.2d at 73 (FISA); United States v. Pelton, 835 F.2d\n1067, 1075 (4th Cir. 1987) (FISA); United States v. Cavanagh, 807 F.2d 787, 790 (9th\nCir. 1987) (FISA); In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 739–40 (FISA); In re Kevork, 634 F.\n35\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 69\nSupp. 1002, 1013 (C.D. Cal. 1985) (FISA), aff’d, 788 F.2d 566 (9th Cir. 1986); United\nStates v. Falvey, 540 F. Supp. 1306, 1313 (E.D.N.Y. 1982) (FISA); Tortorello, 480 F.2d\nat 773–74 (Title III); Bobo, 477 F.2d at 982 (Title III); United States v. Cafero, 473 F.2d\n489, 498 (3d Cir. 1973) (Title III).\nThe consequence of the FAA’s failure to include any of these limitations is that the\ngovernment may target effectively any foreigner for surveillance—even where another\nparty to the communication is a U.S. person. Unlike Title III (in which the government’s\nsurveillance targets must be criminal suspects, see 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1), (3)) and FISA (in\nwhich the surveillance targets must be agents of a foreign power, see 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1804(3)), the FAA permits the surveillance of any foreigner abroad. 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1881a(d). This sweeping authorization ensures that the communications of countless\ninnocent U.S. persons will be monitored. Indeed, allowing the government to acquire U.S.\npersons’ international communications was the very purpose of the FAA. See Hayden\nSJC Statement.\nFor U.S. persons whose international communications are swept up by FAA\nsurveillance, such as Mr. Muhtorov, the sole protection is the FAA’s requirement that the\ngovernment “minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of\nnonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons.” 50\nU.S.C. § 1801(h)(1); see 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(e). This requirement, however, does not\napply to communications that contain “foreign intelligence information.” Id. Moreover,\nthe statute’s definition of “foreign intelligence information” is extraordinarily broad,\n36\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 37 of 69\nencompassing not just information relating to terrorism, but information relating to “the\nconduct of the foreign affairs of the United States.” See 50 U.S.C. § 1881(a); id.\n§ 1801(e).\nIn short, the FAA’s targeting and minimization requirements permit the\ngovernment to target any foreigner abroad for surveillance and to acquire and retain any\nU.S. persons’ international communications with (or about) those foreigners that relate to\n“the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States.” See U.S.C. § 1801(e).  In this\nway, the FAA exposes virtually every international communication—including those with\none end in the United States—to the possibility of warrantless surveillance.13 \nAs touched on earlier, publicly available information about the targeting and\nminimization procedures that has been used by the government confirms the statute’s\ndefects. See generally 2009 Targeting Procedures; 2011 Minimization Procedures. These\n13 The FAA exposes even purely domestic communications to the possibility of surveillance\nas well. The FAA requires the government to “prevent the intentional acquisition of any\ncommunication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the\nacquisition to be located in the United States.” 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added). In\nother words, the statute permits the government to collect any communication so long as it does\nnot know for a fact that all parties to the communication are located inside the United States.\nThis likely has had dramatic implications for the privacy of American residents’ purely domestic\ncommunications, as even the executive itself has indicated that uncertainty about location is the\nrule rather than the exception. See, e.g., Warrantless Surveillance and the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act: The Role of Checks and Balances in Protecting Americans’ Privacy Rights\n(Part II): Hearing Before the H. Judiciary Comm. on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\nand Protect America Act, 110th Cong. 92 (2007) (statement of DNI McConnell) (“Sir, in the old\ndays, Cold War days, location was much, much easier. Today, with mobile communications, it is\nmore difficult. . . . There are some keys that can assist, but we can’t know for certain[].”). On\none occasion, the FISC held that the government’s minimization procedures were\nunconstitutional because they resulted in the collection of “a very large number” of purely\ndomestic communications. [Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *28 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011).\n37\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 38 of 69\nprocedures give effect to the statute’s design by allowing the government to collect U.S.\npersons’ international communications in the course of surveillance directed at foreign\ntargets.  They allow the government to search literally every international communication\ngoing into or out of the United States for information “about” its targets, so long as it uses\n“an Internet Protocol filter to ensure that” one of the parties to the communication “is\nlocated overseas.” 2009 Targeting Procedures 1–2; see also Charlie Savage, NSA Said to\nSearch Content of Messages to and From U.S., N.Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2013,\nhttp://nyti.ms/1cez5ZK. Those same procedures also reveal that among the factors that\ngovernment analysts examine to determine whether a particular email address or phone\nnumber will be used to communicate foreign intelligence information is whether it has\nbeen used in the past to communicate with “an individual associated with a foreign power\nor foreign territory”—a definition broad enough to encompass essentially any foreign\nperson. 2009 Targeting Procedures 4. \nThe procedures also explicitly permit the retention and dissemination of U.S.\npersons’ international communications if “necessary to understand foreign intelligence\ninformation or assess its importance.” 2011 Minimization Procedures § 6(a)(2), (b)(2).\nThey permit the government to retain purely domestic communications acquired through\nthe accidental targeting of U.S. persons if the government determines that they contain\n“significant foreign intelligence information” or “evidence of a crime.” Id. § 5(1)–(2).\nU.S. persons’ communications that do not contain foreign intelligence or evidence of a\ncrime may be retained for up to five years. Id. § 3(b)(1). Even communications identified\n38\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 39 of 69\nas “attorney–client” communications may be retained to “preserv[e] foreign intelligence\ninformation contained therein.” Id. § 4. Finally, the minimization procedures allow so-\ncalled “backdoor searches,” in which the government later searches communications\nacquired under the FAA specifically for information about U.S. persons—like Mr.\nMuhtorov—for any reason whatsoever. See id. § 3(b)(6).\nAs codified and as implemented, the FAA’s targeting and minimization\nrequirements—in permitting nearly unfettered surveillance of U.S. persons’ international\ncommunications—bear little resemblance to the procedures in place under Title III and\nFISA. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 740–41 (stating that courts have found\nFISA’s minimization requirements to be “constitutionally significant”); Pelton, 835 F.2d\nat 1075 (similar); Duggan, 743 F.2d at 74 (similar); United States v. Turner, 528 F.2d\n143, 156 (9th Cir. 1975) (finding Title III constitutional because, among other things,\n“measures [must] be adopted to reduce the extent of . . . interception [of irrelevant or\ninnocent communications] to a practical minimum”); Figueroa, 757 F.2d at 471 (similar).\n  Title III requires the government to conduct surveillance “in such a way as to\nminimize the interception of” innocent and irrelevant conversations, 18 U.S.C. § 2518(5);\nsee id. (stating that “every order and extension thereof shall contain a provision”\nregarding the general minimization requirement), and strictly limits the use and\ndissemination of material obtained under the statute, see 18 U.S.C. § 2517. FISA\nsimilarly requires the government to minimize the acquisition, retention, and\ndissemination of non-publicly available information concerning U.S. persons. See 50\n39\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 40 of 69\nU.S.C. § 1801(h). It requires that each order authorizing surveillance of a particular target\ncontain specific minimization procedures that will govern that particular surveillance. See\n50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(4); 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(3); 50 U.S.C. § 1805(c)(2)(A). FISA also\nspecifically provides the FISC with authority to oversee the government’s minimization\non an individualized basis during the course of the actual surveillance. See 50 U.S.C. §\n1805(d)(3); see also 18 U.S.C. § 2518(6). Thus, under FISA, minimization is required\nwith respect to every individual surveillance target, and, equally important, minimization\ns judicially supervised during the course of the surveillance.14 \nThe targeting and minimization procedures under the FAA are problematic for still\nother reasons. Unlike the privacy protections in Title III and FISA, the FAA’s targeting\nand minimization procedures are neither individualized nor subject to ongoing judicial\nsupervision. Under the FAA, minimization is not individualized but programmatic:\nMinimization procedures apply not to surveillance of specific targets but rather to\nsurveillance programs, the specific targets of which may be known only to the executive\nbranch. Moreover, the FISC is granted no authority to supervise the government’s\ncompliance with the minimization procedures during the course of an acquisition or even\nto inquire about the treatment of U.S. persons’ communications. Compare with 50 U.S.C.\n14 See Kris & Wilson § 9:1–2 (explaining that “each FISA application must describe\nspecific minimization procedures that the Attorney General believes are appropriate for the\nparticular surveillance or search in question,” that “the FISC may modify the proposed\nminimization procedures,” that the order “must direct that the (modified) procedures be\nfollowed . . . in conducting the surveillance,” and that the FISC “enjoys the authority to review\nthe government’s compliance with minimization procedures”).\n40\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 41 of 69\n§ 1805(d)(3). Nor is there any requirement that the government seek judicial approval\nbefore it analyzes, retains, or disseminates U.S. communications. Compare with 50\nU.S.C. § 1801(h)(4) (requiring court order in order to “disclose[], disseminate[], use[] . . .\nor retain[] for longer than 72 hours” U.S. communications obtained in the course of\nwarrantless surveillance of facilities used exclusively by foreign powers). \nThe FAA’s meager minimization provisions are especially problematic because\nthe FAA does not provide for individualized judicial review at the acquisition stage.\nUnder FISA and Title III, minimization operates as a second-level protection against the\nacquisition, retention, and dissemination of information relating to U.S. persons. The first\nlevel of protection comes from the requirement of individualized judicial authorization\nfor each specific surveillance target. Cf. Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 130–31\n(1978) (“‘The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only when it is\nassured that at some point the conduct of those charged with enforcing the laws can be\nsubjected to the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the\nreasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances.’”\n(quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968))); United States v. James, 494 F.2d 1007, 1021\n(D.C. Cir. 1971) (“The most striking feature of Title III is its reliance upon a judicial\nofficer to supervise wiretap operations. Close scrutiny by a federal or state judge during\nall phases of the intercept, from the authorization through reporting and inventory,\nenhances the protection of individual rights.” (quotation marks omitted)); Cavanagh, 807\nF.2d at 790. \n41\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 42 of 69\nUnder the FAA, by contrast, there is no first-level protection, because the statute\ndoes not call for individualized judicial authorization of specific surveillance targets (or,\nfor that matter, of specific facilities to be monitored or specific communications to be\nacquired). Unlike FISA and Title III, the FAA permits dragnet surveillance - the mass\nacquisition of Americans’ international telephone calls and emails. In this context,\nminimization requirements should be at least as stringent as they are in the context of\nFISA surveillance of facilities used exclusively by foreign powers. See 50 U.S.C. §\n1801(h)(4). \nb. The FAA lacks other basic protections.\nThe FAA is also unreasonable insofar as it permits the government to conduct\ndragnet surveillance of international communications so long as  “a significant purpose of\nthe acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information.” 50 U.S.C. §\n1881a(g)(2)(A)(v). This relaxed purpose standard allows the government to engage in\nFAA surveillance even if its primary purpose is to discover evidence of criminal activity. \nAs explained above, the Supreme Court and circuit courts have generally permitted\ndepartures from the Fourth Amendment’s ordinary requirements only where the\ngovernment’s primary purpose is to collect foreign intelligence information. See Truong,\n629 F.2d at 915–16; Butenko, 494 F.2d at 606; Brown, 484 F.2d at 427 (Goldberg, J.,\nconcurring); see also United States v. Johnson, 952 F.2d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1991) (stating\nthat “the investigation of criminal activity cannot be the primary purpose of the\nsurveillance” and that FISA may “not . . . be used as an end-run around the Fourth\n42\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 43 of 69\nAmendment’s prohibition of warrantless searches”); Pelton, 835 F.2d at 1067 interpreting\npurpose” to mean “primary purpose”); United States v. Megahey, 553 F. Supp. 1180\n(E.D.N.Y. 1982), aff’d sub nom., Duggan, 743 F.2d at 59. While some courts have upheld\nFISA despite Congress’s amendment of it to permit surveillance so long as a “significant\npurpose” of that surveillance is to gather foreign intelligence, see, e.g., In re Sealed Case,\n310 F.3d at 742–44; United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 531 F. Supp. 2d 299, 306–09 (D. Conn.\n2008), at least one court has found that the amendment renders FISA unconstitutional,\nMayfield v. United States, 504 F. Supp. 2d 1037 (D. Or. 2007), vacated, 599 F.3d 964\n(9th Cir. 2010) (en banc). \nWhether or not the “significant purpose” standard is constitutional in the context of\nFISA, the standard is unreasonable in the context of FAA surveillance. The FAA’s\npurpose requirement—unlike FISA’s purpose requirement—applies not to individualized\nparticularized surveillance orders but to entire programs of surveillance. Under the FAA,\nthe government must certify that a significant purpose of a mass-acquisition order is to\ngather foreign intelligence information, but once the FISC has endorsed that acquisition,\nthe government may target particular individuals primarily, or entirely, for the purpose of\ncollecting evidence of criminal activity. Because the FISC may not review on an\nindividualized basis the government’s purpose in targeting particular individuals or\ngroups under the FAA, no court has ever reviewed the purpose of the FAA surveillance of\nthe sort that resulted in the interception of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications.\n43\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 44 of 69\nB. The FAA violates Article III of the Constitution.\nThe FAA violates Article III because it authorizes the FISC to issue mass-\nacquisition orders in the absence of any case or controversy and requires the court to\nreview the legality and constitutionality of the government’s programmatic procedures in\nthe abstract. \nThe Constitution “extend[s]” the judicial power of the United States to only\n“cases” and “controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. That requirement is a condition\nprecedent to the exercise of judicial authority, “restrict[ing]” federal courts to the\n“resolution of concrete disputes between the parties before them.” Sec’y of State of Md. v.\nJoseph H. Munson Co., Inc., 467 U.S. 947, 976 (1984); accord Massachusetts v. EPA,\n549 U.S. 497, 516 (2007); see also Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333\nU.S. 103, 113 (1948) (Article III forbids federal courts from issuing “advisory opinions[,]\neven when asked by the Chief Executive.”). In other words, courts may pass only upon\nparticularized issues capable of judicial resolution—“flesh-and-blood legal problems with\ndata relevant and adequate to an informed judgment.” New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747,\n768 (1982) (quotation marks omitted). Conversely, courts are without the power to issue\n“abstract declaration[s] of the law,” In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561, 566–67 (1945)\n(quotation marks omitted), or adjudicate legal questions based “upon a hypothetical state\nof facts,” Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). See Felix\nFrankfurter, A Note on Advisory Opinions, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1002, 1005 (1937) (“Facts\nand facts again are decisive.”); see also Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 97 (1968); Citizens\n44\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 45 of 69\nConcerned for Separation of Church & State v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 628 F.2d 1289,\n1295 (10th Cir. 1980); United States v. Smith, 686 F. Supp. 847, 855 (D. Colo. 1988)\n(Kane, J.) (“Discharging tasks other than the deciding of cases and controversies would\n‘involve the judges too intimately in the process of policy and thereby weaken confidence\nin the disinterestedness of their judicatory functions’”). \nThe FAA assigns to an Article III court a role that is fundamentally incompatible\nwith the case-or-controversy requirement. Under the FAA scheme, the government asks\nthe FISC to approve programmatic surveillance orders that will result in the mass\nacquisition of Americans’ communications without any individualized review or approval\nof the government’s monitoring activity. The FISC’s role is limited to evaluating in a\nvacuum whether the government’s proposed targeting and minimization procedures\ncomply with the statute and the Constitution, without any concrete factual context relating\nto particular targets. Article III “admonishes federal courts . . . to abstain from entangling\nthemselves in abstract disagreements,” Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 119 F.3d 1437, 1443\n(10th Cir. 1997) (quotation marks omitted), but engagement with abstraction is exactly\nwhat the FAA demands. And while Article III only “embraces application of principles of\nlaw or equity to facts,” Vermont v. New York, 417 U.S. 270, 277 (1974), the FAA calls for\nn abstract assessment of the general rules that will govern a surveillance program to be\nimplemented entirely by the executive branch. \nIt is instructive that, in rejecting Article III challenges to the traditional FISA\nprocess, courts have pointed to the fact that the traditional FISA process is a\n45\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 46 of 69\nparticularized one—that it involves the court’s consideration of concrete facts about the\nspecific person to be monitored, the facilities to be targeted, and the purpose of the\nsurveillance. For example, in Megahey, the court rejected an Article III challenge to a\ntraditional FISA order because “[a]pplications for electronic surveillance submitted to\nFISC pursuant to FISA involve concrete questions respecting the application of the Act\nand are in a form such that a judge is capable of acting on them, much as he might\notherwise act on an ex parte application for a warrant.” 553 F. Supp. at 1197; see id.\n(“The FISC judge who is faced with a [traditional FISA] application is not faced with an\nabstract issue of law or called upon to issue an advisory opinion, but is, instead, called\nupon to ensure that the individuals who are targeted do not have their privacy interests\ninvaded, except in compliance with the detailed requirements of the statute.” (emphasis\nadded)); see also United States v. Falvey, 540 F. Supp. 1306, 1313 (E.D.N.Y. 1982); see\nIn re Kevork, 634 F. Supp. 1002.\nThe Office of the Legal Counsel (“OLC”) relied on the same reasoning in\ndefending the constitutionality of FISA in the debate preceding that statute’s enactment in\n1978. Key to the OLC’s analysis was the fact that the FISC would be able to “apply\nstandards of law to the facts of a particular case” in the form of probable cause\ndeterminations akin to those “made in other warrant proceedings.” Memorandum from\nJohn M. Harmon, Assistant Att’y Gen., OLC, to Hon. Edward P. Boland, Chairman,\nHouse Permanent Select Comm. on Intelligence (Apr. 18, 1978), reprinted in Foreign\nIntelligence Electronic Surveillance: Hearings on H.R. 5794, H.R. 9745, H.R. 7308, and\n46\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 47 of 69\nH.R. 5632 Before the Subcomm. on Legis. of the H. Permanent Select Comm. on\nIntelligence, 95th Cong. 26, 28 (1978). \nThus, as both the judicial and executive branches have recognized, a traditional\nFISA order presents the court with a concrete question about a particular proposed\ninterception. By contrast, a mass-acquisition order under the FAA  demands only a broad\nassessment of whether the government’s minimization and targeting procedures are\nreasonable—a question asked and answered at the highest level of generality without\nreference to particular persons or facilities. That question is simply not a case or\ncontroversy appropriate for judicial resolution under Article III.\nII. Mr. Muhtorov is entitled to discovery concerning the government’s\ninterception of his communications under the FAA.\nAlthough Mr. Muhtorov challenges the constitutionality of FAA surveillance in\nthis motion, the government has not provided him with material that would enable him to\nraft a challenge to the specific manner in which the FAA was used in his case. In order\nfor this Court to “make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance,” 50\nU.S.C. § 1806(f), and as required by due process, id. § 1806(g); Brady v. Maryland, 373\nU.S. 83 (1963), it should order disclosure of information including but not limited to: the\ngovernment’s applications to the FISC seeking authorization for, and the FISC’s orders\nauthorizing, the FAA surveillance that intercepted communications to or from Mr.\nMuhtorov; notice of all communications to or from Mr. Muhtorov intercepted under the\nFAA; all evidence obtained under the FAA that the government intends to use at trial or\n47\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 48 of 69\nthat is material to Mr. Muhtorov’s defense; all evidence derived from communications\nintercepted under the FAA that the government intends to use at trial; and records\nindicating how Mr. Muhtorov’s communications were intercepted and identified under\nthe FAA or were derived from communications collected under the FAA. See Part II.B,\ninfra. \nA. Disclosure of additional information is required by FISA and the due\nprocess clause.\nThe government’s notice of its intent to use information obtained or derived from\nFAA surveillance contains only a bare recitation of the statutory language requiring the\nnotice, 50 U.S.C. § 1806(c). See Doc. 457. The notice is insufficient to allow Mr.\nMuhtorov to craft a suppression motion addressed to the specific FAA surveillance to\nwhich he was subjected. FISA provides two vehicles for correcting this deficiency.\nFirst, even where the Attorney General has certified that disclosure of materials\nrelevant to a motion to suppress would harm the national security, FISA provides that\n“the court may disclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security procedures\nand protective orders, portions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the\nsurveillance only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of\nthe legality of the surveillance.” 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f). Second, even where section 1806(f)\ndoes not mandate disclosure, the statute requires disclosure “to the extent that due process\nrequires” it, 50 U.S.C. § 1806(g), thus expressly incorporating the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment’s due process clause. Here, disclosure is required for both reasons.\n48\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 49 of 69\n1. Disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the\nlegality of the surveillance in light of the complexity of the issues\nand the lack of prior judicial interpretation of the FAA.\nMr. Muhtorov’s challenge presents legal issues of first impression and factual\nissues of significant complexity. Resolution of unique and “complex” questions justifies\ndisclosure of information to defense counsel to facilitate an informed adversarial process.\nSee United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir. 1982). No federal court has yet\naddressed the constitutionality of FAA surveillance.15 Indeed, as discussed above, Mr.\nMuhtorov’s case is the first in which a defendant has received the statutorily required\nnotice that evidence obtained or derived from FAA surveillance will be used against him.\nIn light of the complexity of the issues and the dearth of judicial interpretation of section\n1881a, disclosure is warranted.\nThe issues before the Court are many and complicated.  It must evaluate whether\nthe order or orders authorizing the FAA surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov comply with the\nFourth Amendment and section 1881a, and whether the government’s applications to the\nFISC seeking those orders contained material omissions or misrepresentations or were\notherwise deficient. Cf. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). \n15 The FISC itself believes it lacks the power to address the facial validity of the FAA. See\nIn re Proceedings Required by § 702(I) of FISA Amendments Act of 2008, No. Misc. 08-01, 2008\nWL 9487946, at *2 (FISC Aug. 27, 2008) (stating that its role in reviewing the FAA is\n“narrowly circumscribed,” with its mandate limited to accepting or rejecting “the certification,\nthe targeting procedures and the minimization procedures” provided by the government\n(quotation marks omitted)).\n49\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 50 of 69\nThis Court must further determine whether the targeting and minimization\nprocedures in use at the time the government obtained Mr. Muhtorov’s communications\ncomplied with the Fourth Amendment and section 1881a, whether the government\ncomplied with those procedures, and whether the methods used to collect, identify, and\nsearch Mr. Muhtorov’s communications were lawful. It must determine whether Mr.\nMuhtorov’s communications were obtained via “to/from” or “about” searches of targeted\ncommunications, whether the selectors for which the government searched were\nconsistent with the FAA’s requirements (e.g., whether they were identified with a\nnon–United States person), whether Mr. Muhtorov’s communications obtained pursuant\nto section 1881a were with a lawfully targetable non-U.S. person, and whether, if the\ncommunications were not properly obtained, they were inappropriately retained by the\ngovernment and identified via later queries seeking selectors linked to Mr. Muhtorov or\nother individuals. Finally, it must assess whether other evidence derived, directly or\nindirectly, from the FAA surveillance must be suppressed as the fruit of an\nunconstitutional search. See Wong Sung v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487–88 (1963);\nUnited States v. Carson, 793 F.2d 1141, 1147–48 (10th Cir. 1986). Answering the latter\nquestion will involve determining whether the applications for traditional FISA warrants\nwere tainted by information unconstitutionally obtained pursuant to the FAA. \nNot only are these questions factually and legally complex, but this Court must\nanswer them without the aid of precedent. No court has substantively ruled on a motion to\nsuppress FAA-obtained or -derived surveillance (nor on an affirmative civil challenge to\n50\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 51 of 69\nsuch surveillance), setting this case apart from those that involved traditional FISA\nsurveillance in which courts have denied disclosure under section 1806(f). In traditional\nFISA cases, courts can look to a significant body of case law assessing the\nconstitutionality of the FISA scheme and providing factors with which to evaluate FISA\napplications and orders. See, e.g., United States v. Duka, 671 F.3d 329, 336–47 (3d Cir.\n2011); United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 117–31 (2d Cir. 2010); United States\nv. Hammoud, 381 F.3d 316, 332–34 (4th Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S.\n1097 (2005). \nIn such cases, courts have found that “review of the FISA materials . . . [was]\nrelatively straightforward and not complex,” and therefore ex parte, in camera\nconsideration was appropriate. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 129 (brackets in original)\n(quotation marks omitted). But see Mem. Op. and Order at 3-5, United States v. Daoud,\nNo. 12 cr 723 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 29, 2014) (granting criminal defendant’s motion for\ndisclosure of classified FISA materials).  Here, however, the legal issues are complex and\nthere is little guidance from other courts about how to evaluate the constitutionality of\norders granting applications for FAA surveillance or actual execution of the surveillance.\nDisclosure of the requested information is therefore “necessary to make an accurate\ndetermination of the legality of the surveillance.” 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).\nWithout disclosure, Mr. Muhtorov can challenge the FAA statutory scheme, as he\ndoes here, but he cannot assess the government’s actual surveillance of him. Nor can he\nparticipate in the adversarial process to inform this Court’s evaluation of these issues. \n51\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 52 of 69\nThe Supreme Court in Amnesty envisioned that a criminal case such as this one\nwould provide the opportunity to test the constitutionality of particular FAA acquisitions.\nSee 133 S. Ct. at 1154. But in order for this Court to provide the review, disclosure is\nrequired.  It is entirely reasonable to assume Mr. Muhtorov would advance additional\narguments regarding the legality of the government’s surveillance of him if he understood\nwhat that surveillance entailed. Without disclosure, the Court, and Mr. Muhtorov, will\nlose the benefit of informed arguments from the defense on these issues. \n2. Disclosure and an adversarial hearing is required in light of the\ngovernment’s repeated misrepresentations to the FISC.\nIn cases involving traditional FISA surveillance, courts of appeals have identified\nfactors that would warrant disclosure of applications, warrants, and other materials under\nsection 1806(f). Consistent with FISA’s legislative history, \ndisclosure is “necessary” only where the court’s initial review of the\napplication, order, and fruits of the surveillance indicates that the question\nof legality may be complicated by factors such as “indications of possible\nmisrepresentation of fact, vague identification of the persons to be\nsurveilled, or surveillance records which include a significant amount of\nnonforeign intelligence information, calling into question compliance with\nthe minimization standards contained in the order.”\nBelfield, 692 F.2d at 147 (quoting S. Rep. No. 95–701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1978));\naccord United States v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476 (9th Cir. 1987); Duggan, 743 F.3d at 78.\nRecent disclosures demonstrate that all of these infirmities have plagued FAA\nsurveillance, including during the period when Mr. Muhtorov was surveilled. \n52\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 53 of 69\nRecently declassified FISC opinions show that the government has made a series\nof incomplete or inaccurate representations in its applications for approval of surveillance\nunder the FAA and other FISA authorities, and that the government has repeatedly failed\nto comply with restrictions imposed by the FISC.\nMost notably, one of those opinions held that FAA collection during the same\nperiod as the investigation of Mr. Muhtorov violated the Fourth Amendment. See\n[Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011). That opinion details the\ngovernment’s May 2011 disclosure to the FISC that, contrary to previous statements, the\nNSA was relying on the FAA to collect internet communications that are “wholly\nunrelated to the tasked selector, including the full content of discrete communications that\nare not to, from, or about the facility tasked for collection,” and that the “government\nmight lack confidence in the effectiveness” of its procedures for ensuring that FAA\nsurveillance of internet transactions was being limited to targets actually located overseas.\nId. at *2. In other words, “the government . . . advised the Court that the volume and\nnature of the information it [had] been collecting [was] fundamentally different from what\nthe Court had been led to believe.” Id. at *9. These disclosures “fundamentally alter[ed]\nthe Court’s understanding of the scope of collection conducted pursuant to Section 702.”\nId. at *5. The government’s applications for authorization to conduct FAA surveillance\nthus contained all the problems that justify disclosure: “misrepresentation of fact, vague\nidentification of the persons to be surveilled, [and collection of] surveillance records\nwhich include a significant amount of nonforeign intelligence information, calling into\n53\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 54 of 69\nquestion compliance with the minimization standards contained in [past] orders.” Belfield,\n692 F.2d at 147.\nAgain, these problems coincide temporally with the likely period of FAA\nsurveillance in this case. The government notified the FISC of its FAA compliance\nproblems in a May 2, 2011, letter. As discussed above, the government intercepted email\nand phone communications involving Mr. Muhtorov as early as January 29 of the same\nyear. The criminal complaint in this case refers to communications between Mr.\nMuhtorov and a person located overseas on February 5, March 8, March 22–23, April 2,\nApril 4, August 19, August 26, September 1, and September 4, 2011. Crim. Compl. ¶¶\n12–17, 26–27, Doc. 1. \nThe criminal complaint does not indicate under what authority the surveillance\nwas carried out, nor whether any of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications were intercepted or\nobtained prior to January 29, 2011, under section 1881a or another FISA authority. It\nappears from these facts, however, that Mr. Muhtorov’s communications were collected\npursuant to section 1881a in early 2011, in the months immediately preceding (and\npossibly continuing after) the government’s disclosure to the FISC that it was operating\nits FAA collection in a manner other than what the FISC had approved.\nThe government submitted incorrect and misleading information to the FISC on\nother occasions, as well. As Judge Bates explained, “The Court is troubled that the\ngovernment’s revelations regarding NSA’s acquisition of Internet transactions mark the\nthird instance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial\n54\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 55 of 69\nmisrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program.” [Redacted], 2011\nWL 10945618, at *30 n.14; see also In re Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring\nthe Production of Tangible Things from [redacted], No. BR 09-13, 2009 WL 9150896, at\n*2 (FISC Sept. 25, 2009) (Walton, J.) (“The Court is deeply troubled by the incidents\ndescribed above, which have occurred only a few weeks following the completion of an\n‘end to end review’ by the government of NSA’s procedures and processes for handling\nthe BR metadata, and its submission of a report intended to assure the Court that NSA\nhad addressed and corrected the issues giving rise to the history of serious and widespread\ncompliance problems in this matter and had taken the necessary steps to ensure\ncompliance with the Court's orders going forward.”); In re Production of Tangible Things\nfrom [Redacted], No. BR 08-13, 2009 WL 9150913 (FISC Mar. 2, 2009) (Walton, J.)\n(detailing “misrepresentations to the Court” and “violations of its Orders”); In re\nProduction of Tangible Things from [Redacted], No. BR 08-13, 2009 WL 9157881, at *2\n(FISC Jan. 28, 2009) (Walton, J.) (“The Court is exceptionally concerned about what\nappears to be a flagrant violation of its Order in this matter . . . .”); In re All Matters\nSubmitted to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 218 F. Supp. 2d 611, 620–21 (FISC\n2002) (Lamberth, J.) (explaining government’s “errors related to misstatements and\nomissions of material facts” in FISA applications), abrogated on other grounds, In re\nSealed Case, 310 F.3d 717. \nThe errors in the government’s applications to the FISC, including its applications\nfor FAA surveillance authorization, were not merely “typographical or clerical in nature.”\n55\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 56 of 69\nUnited States v. El-Mezain, 664 F.3d 467, 566 (5th Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted).\nRather, “the errors were . . . pervasive enough to confuse the court as to the quantity or\nquality of the evidence described in the applications,” such that “disclosing the\napplications and related materials to defense counsel would assist the court in making an\naccurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.” Id. at 567 (quotation marks\nomitted). Moreover, because numerous FISC opinions—including opinions authorizing\nFAA surveillance—remain classified, counsel for Mr. Muhtorov have no way to know the\nfull extent of any government misrepresentations or omissions in its applications to the\nFISC or of its noncompliance with FISC orders. Disclosure under section 1806(f) is\nnecessary to enable the robust adversarial testing that accurate review of these issues\nrequires.\nAny misrepresentations in the applications that led to the orders under which Mr.\nMuhtorov’s communications were seized also provide a basis for a hearing pursuant to\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154. “Under Franks, a hearing on the veracity of the\naffidavit supporting a warrant is required if the defendant makes a substantial showing\nthat the affidavit contains intentional or reckless false statements and if the affidavit,\npurged of its falsities, would not be sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.”\nUnited States v. Kennedy, 131 F.3d 1371, 1376 (10th Cir. 1997). Franks permits\nchallenges to “material omissions[] as well as affirmative falsehoods,” id. (quotation\nmarks omitted), and applies to applications for electronic surveillance orders as well as\nthose seeking Rule 41 warrants, United States v. Green, 175 F.3d 822, 828 (10th Cir.\n56\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 57 of 69\n1999); see Duggan, 743 F.3d at 77 n.6. Given the record of affirmative\nmisrepresentations and omissions made by the government in its applications for section\n1881a authorizations (as well as its misrepresentations and omissions in applications for\norders authorizing other forms of FISA surveillance), an adversarial hearing is required to\nassess whether the fruits of those authorizations must be suppressed.\n3. Disclosure is required because information about applications,\norders, and fruits of FAA surveillance are helpful to Mr.\nMuhtorov’s suppression motion and defense.\nThe information sought by Mr. Muhtorov is relevant both to his motion to suppress\nthe fruits of unconstitutional FAA surveillance, and to the adjudication of his guilt and\npunishment. Evidence must be turned over under Brady if it is favorable to the\ndefense—in other words, if it is “exculpatory or impeaching.” Browning v. Trammell, 717\nF.3d 1092, 1094 (10th Cir. 2013). The due process rights embodied in Brady apply both\nto trials and to motions to suppress. United States v. Barton, 995 F.2d 931, 935 (9th Cir.\n1993); Smith v. Black, 904 F.2d 950, 965 (5th Cir. 1990), vacated on other grounds, 503\nU.S. 930 (1992); see also United States v. Johnson, No. 96-2008, 117 F.3d 1429, at *2\n(10th Cir. 1997) (unpublished table opinion) (assuming that Brady applies at motions to\nsuppress).\nThe information and records requested in this motion will likely contain\ninformation favorable to Mr. Muhtorov’s motion to suppress. For example, the\ngovernment’s applications to the FISC and the FISC’s orders that led to the surveillance\nof Mr. Muhtorov will provide evidence that the FAA surveillance scheme approved by\n57\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 58 of 69\nthe FISC and used to surveil Mr. Muhtorov violated the warrant clause and the\nrequirements of section 1881a.16 Information about what communications were surveilled\nand how and why they were obtained will indicate whether the government violated the\ntargeting and minimization restrictions approved by the FISC, whether the search was\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and whether Mr. Muhtorov’s\ncommunications were intercepted for a law enforcement purpose rather than a foreign\nintelligence one. The identification of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications obtained through\nFAA surveillance, and any evidence derived from that surveillance, will allow the defense\no identify the evidence that should be suppressed as the fruits of an unconstitutional\nsearch. All of the requested materials will provide grounds for impeaching declarations or\ntestimony of government officials in opposition to this motion to suppress.\nThe information and records requested in this motion would likely be helpful to\nMr. Muhtorov in mounting a defense at trial. The contents of any communications\nobtained under the FAA but not yet provided to the defense (or even described in the\ncriminal complaint) may be exculpatory, and may provide innocent explanations for\nseemingly incriminating evidence. They may also provide grounds for impeaching the\ntestimony of prosecution witnesses. Due process requires that all records favorable to Mr.\nMuhtorov, including records that are exculpatory or impeaching, must be disclosed.\n16 FISA provides for suppression of evidence on the grounds that “(1) the information was\nunlawfully acquired; or (2) the surveillance was not made in conformity with an order of\nauthorization or approval.” 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e); see id. § 1806(f)–(g).\n58\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 59 of 69\n4. If information helpful or material to the defense is classified, it\nmust be disclosed or excluded.\nThe government violates due process when it withholds information or evidence\nfrom the defense as classified, but still seeks the benefit of the information in its\nprosecution: \n[T]he Government can invoke its evidentiary privileges only at the price of\nletting the defendant go free. The rationale of the criminal cases is that,\nsince the Government which prosecutes an accused also has the duty to see\nthat justice is done, it is unconscionable to allow it to undertake prosecution\nand then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the accused of\nanything which might be material to his defense.\nUnited States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 12 (1953) (footnote omitted). \nSome or all of the information sought by this motion as material to Mr.\nMuhtorov’s defense, including the relevant applications to and orders of the FISC, is\nmarked classified. Consistent with the principle set out in Reynolds, the Classified\nInformation Procedures Act (“CIPA”), 18 U.S.C. app. III, provides a mechanism for\naccommodating both the government’s interest in protecting classified information and\nthe defendant’s right to due process.\nWhen the government makes a claim of privilege over classified information, a\ncourt must “decide whether the information is helpful or material to the defense.” United\nStates v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 80 (2d Cir. 2008). This is a low standard: “To be helpful or\nmaterial to the defense, evidence need not rise to the level that would trigger the\nGovernment’s obligation under Brady v. Maryland . . . to disclose exculpatory\ninformation. [I]nformation can be helpful without being ‘favorable’ in the Brady sense.”\n59\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 60 of 69\nId. (citations and quotation marks omitted). If information meets this standard, the\ngovernment has four options: (1) disclose the material to defense counsel; (2) declassify\nthe material and disclose it; (3) in some circumstances, provide an unclassified summary;\nor, (4) if it rejects the first three options, face exclusion of the material or dismissal of the\nprosecution. See 18 U.S.C. app. III at § 6(c), (e). These provisions function to “protect[ ]\nand restrict[ ] the discovery of classified information in a way that does not impair the\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566, 578 (7th Cir.\n2005) (alterations in original) (quotation marks omitted). \nCIPA thus provides this Court with the mechanism to honor Mr. Muhtorov’s due\nprocess rights, as required by section 1806(g), without compromising the government’s\ninterest in protecting classified information. If the government declines to declassify the\nrequested materials or produce an adequate unclassified summary, it must provide\nsecurity clearances to Mr. Muhtorov’s eligible counsel and disclose the materials under\nan appropriate protective order, as it has done in other prosecutions involving classified\ninformation.17 See, e.g., In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in East Africa, 552\nF.3d 93, 116–18 (2d Cir. 2008); see also United States v. Libby, 467 F. Supp. 2d 20, 22\nn.1, 24–25 (D.D.C. 2006). If the government fails to do so, it may not rely on evidence\nobtained or derived from FAA surveillance. Otherwise, a violation of Mr. Muhtorov’s\ndue process rights will result.\n17 If necessary to gain access to the materials requested in this motion, defense counsel are\nwilling to receive security clearances and to abide by the requirements of those clearances and\nany additional restrictions imposed by protective orders of this Court.\n60\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 61 of 69\n5. Ex parte proceedings are inconsistent with the requirements of\ndue process.\nA failure to disclose to the defense the requested materials, resulting in ex parte\nproceedings on the legality of the FAA surveillance, would, under the circumstances of\nthis case, be inconsistent with due process and the adversary process upon which this\nnation’s justice system is premised.\nThe Supreme Court has recognized the necessity of adversarial proceedings to\nprotect the rights of defendants and reach the correct outcome: “‘[F]airness can rarely be\nobtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights. . . . No better\ninstrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of\nserious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.’” United States v.\nJames Daniel Good Real Prop., 510 U.S. 43, 55 (1993) (alterations in original) (quoting\nJoint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 170–72 (1951)\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring)). Indeed, “[o]ne would be hard pressed to design a procedure\nmore likely to result in erroneous deprivations” than an ex parte proceeding. Am.-Arab\nAnti-Discrimination Comm. v. Reno, 70 F.3d 1045, 1069 (9th Cir. 1995) (quotation marks\nomitted). \nThe guarantee of adversarial proceedings finds a source not only in the due process\nclause, but also in the Sixth Amendment’s confrontation and assistance of counsel\nclauses. “‘The central concern of the confrontation clause is to ensure the reliability of the\nevidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of\n61\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 62 of 69\nan adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.’” United States v. Gomez, 191 F.3d 1214,\n1220 (10th Cir. 1999) (quoting Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116 (1999)). Likewise, the\nSixth Amendment “right to counsel is so fundamental to a fair trial, the Constitution\ncannot tolerate trials in which counsel, though present in name, is unable to assist the\ndefendant to obtain a fair decision on the merits.” Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 395\n(1985). When a defendant’s counsel is denied access to material evidence and\ninformation, the defendant is denied a constitutionally adequate defense. \nThe Supreme Court has cautioned that “[i]n both the volume of the material to be\nexamined and the complexity and difficulty of the judgments involved, cases involving\nelectronic surveillance will probably differ markedly from those situations in the criminal\nlaw where in camera procedures have been found acceptable to some extent.” Alderman,\n394 U.S. at 182 n.14. Here, only by their direct, informed participation can defense\ncounsel be confident that the court is made aware of material omissions or\nmisrepresentations in the government’s FISC submissions, evaluate the content of\nintercepted communications for exculpatory or otherwise material information, and\nenable adequate and accurate consideration by this Court.\nThe need for adversarial proceedings is highlighted by the failures of the FISC’s\ninitial in camera, ex parte authorization of the FAA surveillance that swept up Mr.\nMuhtorov’s records. See Franks, 438 U.S. at 169 (explaining inadequacies of ex parte\nproceedings for issuing search warrants and explaining why defendants must be provided\nan opportunity to later challenge the adequacy and veracity of the government’s arrant\n62\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 63 of 69\napplications in adversary proceedings). Many of the defects of the FISC’s non-adversarial\nprocess are now on display. Recently declassified FISC opinions demonstrate not only a\nrepeating pattern of government misrepresentations, but also repeated reprieves granted\nby the FISC as the government failed to meet successive deadlines to report to the FISC\nor to conform its surveillance to the law. E.g., [Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *2–*3;\nsee also Part II.A.2, supra. During these delays, the FISC failed to provide relief to\npersons subject to illegal surveillance by halting that surveillance for the duration of the\ngovernment’s noncompliance. Most importantly, relying on only the representations of\nthe government, without adversarial testing, the FISC approved surveillance programs\nthat turned out to be overly broad, in violation of statutory authority. See Part II.A.2,\nsupra. The failure of ex parte proceedings to achieve fair and correct outcomes has\nresulted in calls—from members of Congress,18 the President’s blue ribbon panel on\nintelligence reform,19 the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board,20 and others—for\nappointment of an advocate to argue against the government in FISC proceedings. The\n18 See, e.g., USA FREEDOM Act, H.R. 3361, 113th Cong. § 401 (2013),\nhttp://1.usa.gov/1mPQmsh (proposing creation of Office of the Special Advocate to “vigorously\nadvocate before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court of Review, as appropriate, in support of legal interpretations that protect\nindividual privacy and civil liberties”). \n19 See President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies,\nLiberty and Security in a Changing World 200–05 (Dec. 12, 2013), http://1.usa.gov/1be3wsO.\n20 Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board, Report on the Telephone Records Program\nConducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and on the Operations of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court 183–87 (Jan. 23, 2014),\nhttp://www.pclob.gov/All%20Documents/Report%20on%20the%20Telephone%20Records%20\nProgram/PCLOB-Report-on-the-Telephone-Records-Program.pdf.\n63\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 64 of 69\nPresident has agreed with the need for the FISC to “hear[] a broader range of privacy\nperspectives,” and has proposed “the establishment of a panel of advocates from outside\ngovernment to provide an independent voice in significant cases before the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court.”21 \nMr. Muhtorov understands the Court would, in any in camera, ex parte\nproceedings, make every effort to anticipate the arguments his attorneys might raise were\nthey privy to the information sought in this motion and allowed to advocate for\nsuppression on that basis. However, given the complex constitutional issues of first\nimpression raised here, it would be particularly difficult—and inappropriate—for the\nCourt to function as both advocate and judge. The Court would need to anticipate the\ndefense arguments that seek a particular result, evaluate how secret evidence may or may\nnot support that result, and then decide—without particularized briefing or pointed\nadvocacy—whether the arguments it assumes would have been made are persuasive. In\nthis case, as in any where an accused faces the loss of liberty, Mr. Muhtorov is entitled to\nhave the lawyer defending him be his advocate, and to do everything possible to persuade\nthe Court to grant the relief he seeks.  See Mem. Op. and Order at 5, United States v.\nDaoud, No. 12 cr 723 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 29, 2014) (ordering disclosure of classified FISA\nmaterials because “an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance is best\nmade in this case as part of an adversarial proceeding”).\n21 President Barack Obama, Remarks by the President on Review of Signals Intelligence\n(Jan. 17, 2014), http://1.usa.gov/1l2zOBS.\n64\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 65 of 69\nB. Mr. Muhtorov is entitled, at a minimum, to disclosure and discovery of\nthe following materials and facts.\nFor the preceding reasons, Mr. Muhtorov respectfully seeks disclosure to the\ndefense of the following information and records, with full opportunity for defense\nparticipation in any hearings pertaining to them:\n1. Materials relating to the government’s failure to provide Mr. Muhtorov with\ntimely notice that it intended to introduce or otherwise use information\nobtained or derived from FAA surveillance in this proceeding, including\ncopies of any documents setting out, or purporting to justify, the Justice\nDepartment’s now-withdrawn policy of concealing the role of FAA\nsurveillance from criminal defendants.\n2. Materials indicating how Mr. Muhtorov’s communications were intercepted\nand identified under the FAA, including the nature of the targeting and\nqueries that led to their detection (e.g., whether the government conducted\n“to/from” searches or “about” searches, whether the government collected\nmetadata or contents of communications, and what surveillance programs\nthe government used to effect the collection).\n3. Documents indicating which of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications were\nintercepted under the FAA, and the contents those communications.\n4. Documents indicating whether the fruits of FAA surveillance were used to\njustify further investigation of Mr. Muhtorov, or were used in applications\n65\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 520   Filed 01/29/14   USDC Colorado   Page 66 of 69\nfor additional surveillance authority, including under 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1861(b)(2)(A) (Section 215), id. § 1842 (FISA pen-register and trap-and-\ntrace provision), and 18 U.S.C. § 2709 (national security letters provision).\n5.

Here,  too,  the  significant  concern  of  our \ndangerousness  inquiry  is  Muhtorov’s  alleged  intent  to \nFootnotes \n \n*  After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would \n  not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is \ntherefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except \n  6 \n \n\n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 702 Fed.Appx. 694 (2017)   \n \n \nunder the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its \npersuasive value consistent with Fed.

I, Donald E. Hale, Special Agent (SA) assigned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI), Department of Justice, being duly sworn, hereby state: \n2.  Your affiant is a Special Agent with the FBI, having been so for approximately 9 years.  I \nhave completed the FBI's Special Agent training course at Quantico, V A.  Subsequently \nmy duties have included assignments to investigate a variety of criminal violations to \ninclude federal terrorism offenses.  Your affiant currently investigates violations of \nfederal law associated with terrorism related offenses, including material support of \nforeign terrorist organizations, arson and explosives crimes, firearms offenses, and other \nassociated violations.  Your affiant is authorized to carry firearms, execute warrants, \nmake arrests for offenses against the United States, and to perform other duties as \nauthorized by law. \n3.  This affidavit is made in support of a criminal complaint against Jamshid MUHTOROV, \naJk/a Abumumin Turkistony, aJk/a Abu Mumin, year of birth 1976, for a violation of \nTitle 18, United States Code Section 2339B:  Provision of Material Support to a \nDesigna,ted Terrorist Organization, specifically provision and attempted provision of \npersonnel to the Islamic Jihad Union (\"IJU\").  This affidavit is also in support of an \napplication for the following search warrants: (1) for a residence located at 9901 E. Evans \nAvenue, Apt. 9D, Denver, Colorado; (2) for a Sony Vaio laptop computer; (3) for an \nAndroid Blackberry Cellular Phone; (4) for the horun30@gmail.com gmail account; and, \n(5) for the l11jal11s3476@gl11ail.com gmail account.  The statements set forth in this \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 18\naffidavit are based upon my training and experience, consultation with other experienced \ninvestigators and agents, and investigative reports and other documents.  This affidavit is \nintended to set forth probable cause in support of a criminal complaint and search \nwarrants and does not purport to set forth all ofthe affiant's knowledge regarding the \ninvestigation. \nBACKGROUND \n4.  The Islamic Jihad Union (\"IJU\", also known as al-Djihad al-Islami, Dzhamaat \nModzhakhedov, and the Islamic Jihad Group of Uzbekistan) is an extremist organization \nthat splintered from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (\"IMU\") in the early 2000s. \nThe IJU adheres to an anti-Western ideology, opposes secular rule in Uzbekistan, and \nseeks to replace the current regime with a government based on Islamic law. \n5.  The IJU first conducted attacks in April of 2004, targeting a popular bazaar and police at \nseveral roadway checkpoints.  These attacks killed approximately 47 people, induding 33 \nterrorists, some suicide bombers.  The IJU claimed responsibility for these attacks on \nmultiple militant Islamic web sites and denounced the leadership of Uzbekistan. \n6.  In July 2004 the IJU conducted simultaneous suicide bombings of the US and Israeli \nEmbassies and the Uzbekistani Prosecutor General's Office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.  In \nclaiming responsibility for these attacks, the IJU stated that their martyrdom operations \nwould continue.  The IJU also claimed the attacks were committed in support of their \nPalestinian, Iraqi and Afghan brothers in the global insurgency. \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 18\n7.  In September 2007, German authorities arrested three DU operatives, disrupting a plot \nagainst unidentified US or Western facilities in Germany.  The DU operatives had \nacquired about 700 kg of hydrogen peroxide and an explosives precursor, which was \nenough raw material to make the equivalent of about 1,200 pounds of TNT.  The DU \nclaimed responsibility for the foiled plot. \n8.  The DU has claimed responsibility for attacks targeting Coalition forces in Afghanistan \nin 2008, including a March 2008 suicide attack against a U.S. military post purportedly \ncarried out by a German-born Turk. \n9.  In April 2009, Turkish authorities seized weapons and detained extremists with ties to the \nDU.  The DU has also claimed responsibility for a May 2009 attack in Uzbekistan and \nnumerous attacks in Afghanistan against Coalition forces.  It is believed that members of \nboth the DU and IMU have trained with and provided support to Al Qaida. \n10. The website www.sodiqlar.comis an Uzbek language website that hosts operational \nclaims and statements from the DU.  The website administrator for www.sodiqlar.comis \nknown by the alias \"Abu Muhammad.\" Public reporting shows that www.sodiqlar.comis \naffiliated with the IJU and is suspected to be owned and operated by the DU. \n11. The Islamic Jihad Union is a designated terrorist organization, designated by the \nSecretary of State, and continuously designated since June 12, 2005 (under the name \nIslamic Jihad Group). Notification of its designation appears at 70 F. Reg. 35332-01 \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 18\n(June 17,2005), amended to include name \"Islamic Jihad Union\" on April 29, 2008, \npublished in the 73 F. Reg 30443-01 (May 27,2008). \nFACTS OF THE CASE \n12. The FBI has been investigating Jamshid MUHTOROV based on his communications \nwith www.sodiglar.col11 website administrator and Islamic Jihad Union (\"IJU\") facilitator \n\"Muhammad.\"  \"Muhammad\" is known as \"Abu Muhammad.\" (Hereafter referred to as \nMuhammad in this \"Facts ofthe Case\" section)  MUHTOROV communicated with \nMuhammad using at least two email addresses through the IJU -affiliated email address \nsodiqlar@gmail.com.  MUHTOROV's two email addresses are horun30@gmail.com and \nmjams3476@gmaiLcom.  Pursuant to court authorization, the FBI obtained the email \ncommunications for both of these accounts.  Additionally, pursuant to court \nauthorization, the FBI obtained communications originating from MUHTOROV's phone \nlines.  FBI lawful search and surveillance has shown that the email address \nhorun30@gmaiLcom is associated with and used by Jamshid Muhtorov.  The FBI \nlawfully discovered that these email accounts are regularly accessed through a Sony Vaio \nlaptop computer with a Toshiba hard drive, serial number 600YT5PKT.  Additionally, \nthrough legally authorized methods, the FBI learned that the mobile phone used by \nMUHTOROV is an Android Blackberry with the telephone number (720) 775-8484. \n13. On February 5,2011, using the new email addressofmjams3476@gmail.com. \nMUHTOROV emailed Muhammad.  FBI lawful search and surveillance has shown that \nthe email addressmjams3476@gmail.comis associated with and used by Jamshid \nMuhtorov. \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 18\n14. On March 8, 2011, MUHTOROV received a phone call from a known associate. \nMUHTOROV told the associate that the \"wedding house\" sends greetings. \nMUHTOROV then read the associate parts of a message from the 00, calling them \"our \nguys over there.\"  MUHTOROV told the associate that the DU said they need material \nsupport.  MUHTOROV asked the associate if the associate remembered Juma \nNamangani (a founder of the IMU who was killed in 2001 in Afghanistan by a U.S. \nairstrike).  The associate said he remembered Namangani very well.  The associate then \nwarned MUHTOROV to be careful talking about Namangani and other sensitive \ninformation while on the phone.  The associate warned MUHTOROV about surveillance. \nBoth MUHTOROV and the associate then cursed whoever might be listening in on their \nconversations and called upon Allah to punish those who do so. \n15. On March 22-23,2011, MUHTOROV updated Muhammad by email on his efforts and \nintentions.  MUHTOROV committed himself to Bay'ah - an allegiance to the DU. \nMUHTOROV told Muhammad the he [MUHTOROV] was \"ready for any task, even \nwith the risk of dying.\"  [Muhammad later acknowledges that the Bay'ah has been passed \non to the group leadership.] \n16. On April 2, 2011, MUHTOROV emailed Muhammad and explained that an associate \nsent money for a ''wedding gift.\" Muhammad told MUHTOROV to wait, and promised \nto find out how the IJU wanted the money to be sent.  MUHTOROV asked to be invited \nto the wedding, expressing his willingness to help with \"the wedding\" and to hear from \nthe \"master of ceremonies\" about plans for \"the wedding.\" \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 18\n17. Muhammad responded to MUHTOROV's email on April 4, 2011 explaining that the \n\"master of ceremonies\" was busy and unable to communicate with MUHTOROV \ndirectly.  On May 4,2011, MUHTOROV wrote Muhammad saying that he was \ndisappointed that he was not \"invited to the wedding.\" MUHTOROV wrote to \nMuhammad that even though he [MUHTOROV] was not invited to \"the wedding,\" he \n[MUHTOROV] will still travel to Istanbul before the \"hot season,\" and that he \n[MUHTOROV] will bring a \"wedding gift.\" \n18. Based upon training and experience, your affiant knows that the term ''wedding'' is used \nas code for a terrorist event or attack.  Further, your affiant knows that the practice of \nBay' ah is an allegiance to a particular group or person in Islamic tradition. \n19. MUHTOROV began searching online for flights from Denver to Istanbul, Turkey on \nMay 3,2011. Using a number of different web sites, MUHTOROV looked at a number \nof one-way flights departing between June 15-17, 2011.  However, he did not purchase a \nticket. \n20. During the months of June, July and August of 20 11, MUHTOROV significantly \nincreased the amount of hours he was working for the vehicle transport company, \ndelivering vehicles to a number of far ranging locations including Vermont, lllinois, and \nArizona. \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 18\n21. On July 8,2011, MUHTOROV told his wife Nargiza by phone that Arizona looks just \nlike Jizzak, and that they should move there.  MUHTOROV's wife laughed and said \n\"Didn't you want to go to Turkey?\" \n22. On July 20,2011, MUHTOROV's wife Nargiza called MUHTOROV and explained that \nshe had tickets for her and their children to fly to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  She explained \nthat the flight was on July 25th at 3:20 from Denver-Chicago-Istanbul-Bishkek, and asked \nMUHTOROV ifhe would be home before they left.  MUHTOROV told her that he might \nbe home, and said \"Why don't you buy one more ticket to Istanbul for me?\" Nargiza told \nhim that it was too late, they already purchased their tickets.  She complained \"I told you \nwe're going to buy tickets, why didn't you tell me you want to fly out too, I would've \nplanned accordingly.\" MUHTOROV insisted that it was still possible for her to get a \nticket for him as well.  Nargiza reminded MUHTOROV that she has no money.  She also \ncommented that MUHTOROV always changes his mind.  Nargiza then searched the \ninternet for another plane ticket on the same flight she had booked with the option to get \noff in Istanbul.  She told MUHTOROV that there was one ticket for $988 but it was a \ndifferent flight.  MUHTOROV said he will not take a different flight. \n23. On July 22,2011, MUHTOROV and his wife fight during a phone call.  MUHTOROV \ntells Nargiza Muhtorov to \"choose - me [MUHTOROV] or your mother.\" Nargiza \nretorts \"How about you?  Didn't you want to leave us for Turkey?\" \n24. In a phone conversation on July 25,2011, MUHTOROV told his young daughter that he \nwould never see her again; but, if she was a good Muslim girl, he will see her in heaven. \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 18\n25. On August 1,2011, MUHTOROV told his father that he'll leave for his \"studies\" in \nSeptember after his family returns. \n26. MUHTOROV received an email from Muhammad on August 19,2011 telling \nMUHTOROV that it was good that MUHTOROV told Muhammad about a person \nnamed \"Sahwii\".  Muhammad asked MUHTOROV let him know ifMUHTOROV had \nany more detailed information about \"Sahwii.\"  Muhammad also asked MUHTOROV to \nprovide details about a person named \"Talib\".  Muhammad told MUHTOROV that if \n\"Talib\" is bad mouthing Mujaheddin, they will have to find a way to frighten him. \nMUHTOROV responded by email on August 26, 2011 explaining that he hasn't seen \n\"Talib\" for a long time.  MUHTOROV wrote that he scolded \"Talib\" really hard; and, \nthat since then \"Talib\" had been keeping away.  MUHTOROV also wrote that the clever \nanswers posted on your site [sodiqlar] quieted him [\"Talib\"] down a lot. \n27. On September 1, 2011 Muhammad sent MUHTOROV an email comparing \"Sahviy\" and \n\"Talib\" to viruses that erode the Islamic community from the inside while enemies attack \nfrom the outside.  Muhammed continued, telling MUHTOROV that \"to get rid of them, \nwe need an antivirus.\"  Muhammed explained that there \"are two ways antivirus cleans \nfiles -- fixes or quarantines the corrupted files, or wipes the viruses out completely.\" \nMuhammed wrote that they will try to fix \"Sahviy\" and \"Talib\", otherwise they will do \njihad against them as prescribed by Allah.  Muhammad told MUHTOROV that Allah \npermits jihad against hypocrites and ignorant people the same way the jihad against the \ninfidels is being done.  On September 4, 2011 MUHTOROV replied to Muhammad that \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 18\n\"As for the antivirus, we have the most powerful antivirus -- the book of Allah and \nteachings of our Prophet, Peace be upon Him.\" \n28. On January 3,2012 MUHTOROV called his wife Nargiza and told her that he was \nleaving the United States for Istanbul, Turkey on January 15,2012.  Subsequently, \nMUHTOROV has continued to have conversations with Nargiza planning his impending \ntravel.  On January 6,2012 MUHTOROV asked her to find his passport and other \ndocuments necessary for travel. \n29. On or about January 7,2012, MUHTOROV told an associate he was leaving the United \nStates on January 17, 2012.  MUHTOROV informed the associate that his last day at the \ntrucking job would be January 15, 2012 and that he would return home to Colorado on \nthat day, find his passport and then return to Chicago and fly to Istanbul, Turkey on \nJanuary 17,2012. \n30. MUHOTORV resigned from his job driving trucks on or about January 1, 2012.  He \nprovided his employer with two weeks notice, indicating his last day on the job would be \nJanuary 15,2012. \n31. On January 3,2012 MUHTOROV used his phone to browse the internet for flights to \nIstanbul, Turkey.  MUHTOROV, using the web site CheapTickets.com, focused on \nTurkish Airlines flight 6 leaving O'Hare Airport in Chicago, Illinois on January 18, 2012. \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 18\n32. On January 16, 2012, MUHTOROV went online and purchased a ticket through \nCheapTickets.com on LOT Polish Airlines from Chicago, Illinois to Istanbul, Turkey. \nThis flight is scheduled to depart on January 21,2012 at 5:25 pm CST.  The flight \nconnects through Warsaw, Poland via Polish Airlines flight number 2, arriving in \nIstanbul, Turkey on Polish Airlines flight number 135. \nSEARCHING COMPUTERS \n33. As described above and in Attachment B for the search warrants, this affidavit is in \nsupport of an application seeking permission to search and seize records, computers, and \nelectronic storage media (including cellular phones or other personal media devices) that \nmight be found at Jamshid MUHTOROV's residence, located at 9901 E. Evans Avenue, \nApt. 9D, Denver, Colorado or within Jamshid MUHTOROV's possession.  Some ofthese \nelectronic records might take the form of files, documents, and other data that is user-\ngenerated.  Some of these electronic records, as explained below, might take a form that \nbecomes meaningful only upon forensic analysis. \n34. For example, based on knowledge, training, and experience, your affiant knows that a \npowered-on computer maintains volatile data.  Volatile data can be defined as active \ninformation temporarily reflecting a computer's current state including registers, caches, \nphysical and virtual memory, network connections, network shares, running processes, \ndisks, floppy, tape and/or CD-ROM and printing activity.  Collected volatile data may \ncontain such information as opened files, connections to other computers, passwords used \nfor encryption, the presence of anti-forensic tools, or the presence of programs loaded in \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 18\nmemory that would otherwise go unnoticed.  Volatile data and its corresponding \nevidentiary value is lost when a computer is powered-off and unplugged. \n35. Based on knowledge, training, and experience, your affiant knows that computer files or \nremnants of such files can be recovered months or even years after they have been \ndownloaded onto a storage medium, deleted, or viewed via the Internet.  Electronic files \ndownloaded to a storage medium can be stored for years at little or no cost.  Even when \nfiles have been deleted, they can be recovered months or years later using forensic tools. \nThis is so because when a person \"deletes\" a file on a computer, the data contained in the \nfile does not actually disappear; rather, that data remains 011 the storage medium until it is \noverwritten by new data.  Therefore, deleted files, or remnants of deleted files, may \nreside in free space or slack space-that is, in space on the storage medium that is not \ncurrently being used by an active file-for long periods oftime before they are \noverwritten.  In addition, a computer's operating system may also keep a record of \ndeleted data in a \"swap\" or \"recovery\" file. \n36. Also, again based on training and experience, wholly apart from user-generated files, \ncomputer storage media-in particular, computers' internal hard drives-contain electronic \nevidence of how a computer has been used, what it has been used for, and who has used \nit.  This evidence can take the form of operating system configurations, artifacts from \noperating system or application operation, file system data structures, and virtual memory \n\"swap\" or paging files.  Computer users typically do not erase or delete this evidence, \nbecause special software is typically required for that task.  However, it is technically \npossible to delete this information.  Data on the storage medium not currently associated \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 18\nwith any file can provide evidence of a file that was once on the storage medium but has \nsince been deleted or edited, or of a deleted portion of a file (such as a paragraph that has \nbeen deleted from a word processing file).  Web browsers, e-mail programs, and chat \nprograms store configuration information on the storage medium that can reveal \ninformation such as online nicknames and passwords.  Operating systems can record \nadditional information, such as the attachment of peripherals, the attachment of USB \nflash storage devices or other external storage media, and the times the computer was in \nuse.  Computer file systems can record information about the dates files were created and \nthe sequence in which they were created. \n37. As further described in Attachment B for the search warrants, this application seeks \npermission to locate not only computer files that might serve as direct evidence ofthe \ncrimes described on the warrant, but also for evidence that establishes how computers \nwere used, the purpose of their use, who used them, and when. \n38. Similarly, files that have been viewed via the Internet are sometimes automatically \ndownloaded into a temporary Internet directory or \"cache.\" The browser often maintains \na fixed amount of hard drive space devoted to these files, and the files are only \noverwritten as they are replaced with more recently viewed Internet pages or if a user \ntakes steps to delete them. \n39. \"User attribution\" evidence can also be found on a computer and is analogous to the \nsearch for \"indicia of occupancy\" while executing a search warrant at a residence.  For \nexample, registry information, configuration files, user profiles, e-mail, e-mail address \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 18\nbooks, \"chat,\"  instant messaging logs, photographs, and correspondence (and the data \nassociated with the foregoing, such as file creation and last accessed dates) may be \nevidence of who used or controlled the computer or storage medium at a relevant time. \n40. Searching computers for the evidence described in the attachment may require a range of \ndata analysis techniques.  For example, information regarding user attribution or Internet \nuse is located in various operating system log files that are not easily located or reviewed . \n. ' \n, \nOr, a person engaged in criminal activity will attempt to conceal evidence of the activity \nby \"hiding\" files or giving them deceptive names.  As explained above, because the \nwarrant calls for records of how a computer has been used, what it has been used for, and \nwho has used it, it is exceedingly likely that it will be necessary to thoroughly search \nstorage media to obtain evidence, including evidence that is not neatly organized into \nfiles or documents.  Just as a ~earch of a premises for physical objects requires searching \nthe entire premises for those objects that are described by a warrant, a search of this \npremises for the things described in this warrant will likely require a search among the \ndata stored in storage media for the things (including electronic data) called for by this \nwarrant.  Additionally, it is possible that files have been deleted or edited, but that \nremnants of older versions are in unallocated space or slack space.  This, too, makes it \nexceedingly likely that in this case it will be necessary to use more thorough techniques. \n41. Based upon knowledge, training and experience, your affiant knows that a thorough \nsearch for information stored in storage media often requires agents to seize most or all \nstorage media to be searched later in a controlled environment.  This is often necessary to \nensure the accuracy and completeness of data recorded on the storage media, and to \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 18\nprevent the loss of the data either from accidental or intentional destruction. \nAdditionally, to properly examine the storage media in a controlled environment, it is \noften necessary that some computer equipment, peripherals, instructions, and software be \nseized and examined in the controlled environment.  This is true because of the \nfollowing: \na.  The nature of evidence.  As noted above, not all evidence takes the form of \ndocuments and files that can be easily viewed on site.  Analyzing evidence of how \na computer has been used, what it has been used for, and who has used it requires \nconsiderable time, and taking that much time on premises could be unreasonable. \nb.  The volume of evidence.  Storage media can store the equivalent of millions of \npages of information. Additionally, a suspect may try to conceal criminal \nevidence; he or she might store it in random order with deceptive file names.  This \nmay require searching authorities to peruse all the stored data to determine which \nparticular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime.  This sorting process \ncan take weeks or months, depending on the volume of data stored, and it would \nbe impractical and invasive to attempt this kind of data search on-site. \nc.  Technical requirements.  Computers can be configured in several different ways, \nfeaturing a variety of different operating systems, application software, and \nconfigurations.  Therefore, searching them sometimes requires tools or knowledge \nthat might not be present on the search site.  The vast array of computer hardware \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 18\nand software available makes it difficult to know before a search what t()ols or \nknowledge will be required to analyze the system and its data on-site.  However, \ntaking the storage media off-site and reviewing it in a controlled environment will \nallow its examination with the proper tools and knowledge. \nd.  Variety of forms of electronic media.  Records sought under this warrant could be \nstored in a variety of storage media formats that may require off-site reviewing \nwith specialized forensic tools. \n42. Based on training and experience, your affiant further states that if evidence located on a \ncomputer as described on Attachment B for the search warrants appears to relate to \ncriminal acts other than those outlined in this affidavit, those items will not be further \nexamined unless and until a search warrant is applied for and issued for evidence of any \nsuch separate criminal acts. \n43. Based upon the foregoing, your affiant believes there is probable cause to arrest \nMUHTOROV for Provision of Material Support to a Designated Terrorist Organization, \nspecifically provision and attempted provision of personnel to the Islamic Jihad Union \n(\"IJU\"), in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2339B.  Furthermore, there \nis probable cause to issue search warrants: (1) for a residence located at 9901 E. Evans \nAvenue, Apt. 9D, Denver, Colorado; (2) for a Sony Vaio laptop computer; (3) for an \nAndroid Blackberry Cellular Phone; (4) for the horun30@gmail.com gmail account; and, \n(5) for the mjams3476w'gmail.com gmail account. \n15 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 01/19/12   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 18\nI, Donald E.

See P.L. \n110–261, § 403(b)(1), 122 Stat. 2474, as amended, appearing in 50 U.S.C. § 1881 note. \n \n2  In Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, ––– U.S. ––––, 133 S.Ct. 1138, 185 L.Ed.2d 264 (2013), Justice Alito writing for a \n  majority of the Supreme Court held that attorneys, human rights, and media organizations lacked article III standing \nto challenge the constitutionality of § 702 because they could only speculate that their communications had been or \nwould be incidently acquired during FAA surveillance of their clients or other targeted persons abroad. With the \ngovernment’s notice in this case, the acquisition of Mr. Muhtorov’s communications is demonstrable and he is \ntherefore “Clapper–qualified” to challenge the law. \n \n3  United States v. United States Dist. Court for the Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U.S. 297, 92 S.Ct. 2125, 32 L.Ed.2d 752 \n  (1972)(known as the Keith case). \n \n4  I note Mr. Jumaev has filed his own renewed Motion to Suppress and/or for Discovery (Doc. 521), insisting that FAA \n  must have informed the government’s investigation and indictment of him notwithstanding the government’s \ndisclaimer and the fact that it filed no Notice of Intent to Use FAA–Acquired information against him in this case. \nBased on the government’s representations that it does not intend to use FAA–acquired evidence against him and \nmy ex parte review of all of the classified information in this case, I conclude Mr. Jumaev is not an “aggrieved \nperson” authorized under 50 U.S.C. § 1806(e) to move to suppress such evidence or to bring an as-applied \nconstitutional challenge to Section 702. The question of whether the disclaimer deprives Mr. Jumaev of standing to \nassert a facial challenge to the FAA under Clapper is an open one, in my view, but one, given my ruling in this case, \nthat does not need to be answered. I limit my analysis in this opinion to the constitutional arguments raised by Mr. \nMuhtorov. \n \n5  Section 4 of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides that “[t]he court, upon a sufficient showing, \n  may authorize the United States to delete specified items of classified information from documents to be made \navailable to the defendant through discovery under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to substitute a \nsummary of the information for such classified documents, or to substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that \nthe classified information would tend to prove.” I have, to date, accepted the government’s averred classification \nassertions as offered. Through the upcoming § 4 process, I intend to put the government through its paces to justify \nthem, and to urge the declassification that was promised for much of the Muhtorov and Jumaev–related discovery \nin this case. \n \n6  See 50 U.S.C. § 1801(i)(defining “United States person” as, among other things, “a citizen of the United States” or \n  “an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence”). \n \n7  See Fiss, O., “Even in a Time of Terror,” 31 Yale Law & Policy Rev. 1 (2012). \n   \n8  Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (the “Wiretap Act”) governs domestic electronic \n  surveillance activities and requires federal, state, and other officials to obtain judicial approval on a specific showing \nof probable cause before intercepting “wire, oral, and electronic” communications such as telephone conversations \n  12 \n \n\n \nUnited States v.

Given  that  international  communications  in  1978  were  carried  through  satellite  signals  or  over \ntransoceanic cables subject to interception offshore, Congress understood this language would exempt NSA’s \nforeign-to-foreign as well as most of its international communications surveillance from regulation, because neither \nwould fall within the definition of “electronic surveillance” under the Act: \n“The  language  of  this  amendment  exempts  ...  foreign  intelligence  gathering  ....  if  the \nacquisition does not come within the definition of ‘electronic surveillance’.... Specifically this \nprovision is designed to make clear that the legislation does not deal with international signals \nintelligence activities as currently engaged in by the National Security Agency and electronic \nsurveillance conducted outside the United States.” \nSee United States v. Mohamud, Crim., Case No. 10–cr–475–KI, slip op. at p. 12, 2014 WL 2866749 (D. Or. June 24, \n2014)(quoting S. Rep. No. 95–701, at 71 (1978)). \n \n10  “Minimization procedures” under FISA are defined as “specific procedures ... adopted by the Attorney General, that \n  are reasonably designed ... to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly \navailable information concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of the United States \nto obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.” 50 U.S.C. § 1801(h). \n \n11  The 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran; a series of Libyan and Hezbollah bombings, attacks and hostage \n  taking beginning in 1982 and continuing throughout the 80s and early 90s, including the 1988 bombing of a Pan–Am \nflight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988; the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York; and the Oklahoma City \nbombing in 1995 are but a few examples. \n \n12  The advent of the internet, for example, meant that foreign communications previously transmitted via satellite or \n  transoceanic cables in 1978 were now carried over fiber optic cables. Because these cables were arguably “wires,” \nforeign surveillance that would have been excluded from FISA regulation in 1978 was rendered potentially unlawful \ndue merely to a change in technology, rather than any intentional decision by Congress. See Modernization of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act: Hearing before the S. Sel. Comm. on Intel., 110th Cong., 1st Sess. (2007) at pp. \n9–19 (testimony of the Director of National Intelligence). \n \n13  EO 12333’s complete text appears at 46 Fed.

See generally, Congressional Research Service (2002b), “The USA \nPATRIOT Act: A sketch.” [On–line]. Available: http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RS21203.pdf \n \n16  During hearings, Congress heard testimony on the ways the advancement of communications technology since 1978 \n  13 \n \n\n \nUnited States v. Muhtorov, 187 F.Supp.3d 1240 (2015)   \n \n \n  had created unforeseen consequences under FISA. Transmission over an integrated global communications grid \nblurred the distinction between domestic and offshore acquisition. Domestic communications between neighbors in \nPeoria could travel around the world and be intercepted abroad. Foreign-to-foreign communications that were \npreviously beyond FISA’s reach could be intercepted in the United States. \n[As a communication travels the global network,] NSA may have multiple opportunities to intercept it as it moves \nand changes medium. As long as a communication is otherwise lawfully targeted, we should be indifferent to \nwhere the intercept is achieved. Signals intelligence is a difficult art and science .... Intercept of a particular \ncommunication ... is always probabilistic, not deterministic [and] [n]o coverage is guaranteed. \nFISA for the 21st Century: Hg. before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d Sess. (2006)(statement of NSA \nDirector General Michael V. Hayden). The necessary fix, Congress was told, was a “technology-neutral” framework \nfor surveillance of foreign targets—focused not on “how a communication travels or where it is intercepted,” but on \n“who  is  the  subject  of  the  surveillance,  which  really  is  the  critical  issue  for  civil  liberties  purposes.”  FISA \nModernization Hg. at 46 (statement of Asst. Atty Gen. Kenneth L. Wainstein). With these changes, it was implied, \nthe original balance between strictly “foreign” foreign intelligence gathering and foreign intelligence gathering that \nimpacted Americans struck by FISA in 1978 could be reconstituted, and secret programs like TSP could be brought to \nlight and integrated into the FISA framework. \n \n17  Compliance with § 702(b) limitations and with the Attorney General’s proffered targeting and minimization \n  procedures  is  self-monitored  and  self-executing  under  the  FAA,  as  judicial  review  is  limited  to  the  initial \nauthorization and any reauthorizations sought by amendment. See § 1881a(i). The FAA requires that the Attorney \nGeneral and Director of National Intelligence conduct a “semi-annual assessment” of compliance with the targeting \nand minimization procedures of a particular surveillance authorization, § 1881a(l), but other than submitting that \nassessment to FISC and to congressional intelligence and judiciary committees, the FAA requires no action on the \nassessment and no judicial review on the part of FISC. \n \n18  United States v. Smith, 686 F.Supp. 847 (D. Colo. 1988)(declaring Sentencing Reform Act of 1986 unconstitutional, in \n  part, because role played by Article III judges on Sentencing Commission violated principles of separation of \npowers). \n \n19  Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 97, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968)(addressing case in controversy requirement in \n  context of standing analysis for taxpayer suit challenging validity of federal spending on textbooks); Citizens \nConcerned for Separation of Church & State v.

The citation to my opinion \nin Smith is more interesting, because although my ruling there passed on a completely different aspect of the \nseparation of powers doctrine, I observed that article III judges “ ‘[d]ischarging tasks other than the deciding of cases \nand controversies’ ” would involve them in the process of policy and thereby “ ‘weaken confidence in the \ndisinterestedness of their judicatory functions.’ ” 686 F.Supp. at 855 (quoting In re Sealed Cases, 838 F.2d 476, 512 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988). The point is correct, in my view, but not particularly germane. If the concern is that FISC’s \nparticipation in § 702 authorizations undermines the perceived impartiality or detachment of the judiciary from law \nenforcement, it is of a kind with concerns over judges participation in secret or ex parte proceedings of all types, and \nwiretap authorizations generally. \n \n20  See New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 768, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982)(addressing the need to focus on \n  “flesh-and-blood” applications of fact to law in context of First Amendment overbreadth challenge to child \npornography statute); Aetna Life Ins.

Mohamud, 2014 WL 2866749 (2014), upholding the FAA and the government’s disclosure that it had used \nFAA–acquired evidence to secure the conviction of a U.S. person. Defendant’s arguments in Mohamud, discussed \nfurther infra, included an Article III challenge similar to Mr. Muhtorov’s here. While I agree with several of Judge \nKing’s  legal  conclusions  in  Mohamud,  I  find  his  analysis  of  defendant’s  “case  or  controversy”  arguments \nunpersuasive. Judge King spent most of his discussion couching defendant’s arguments in terms of a separation of \npowers challenge, which he contends has been put to rest by Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 109 S.Ct. 647, \n102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). Id. at *10–11. As set forth in n. 19, supra, I find the separation of powers analysis inapposite \nto the “case or controversy” argument raised. Judge King’s further discussion equates FISC’s role in FAA surveillance \nauthorizations to the “neutral and detached” review conducted by magistrates under the Wiretap Act, citing Keith. \nId. at *11. In so doing, Judge King did not address the fundamental differences between wiretap authorization \nreviews conducted in criminal cases and traditional FISA on the one hand, and the FAA on the other. As a result, I do \nnot believe Mohamud moves the ball forward on this issue. \n \n22  See Duka, 671 F.3d at 341 (stating “courts have concluded that the important national interest in foreign intelligence \n  gathering justifies electronic surveillance without prior judicial review, creating a sort of ‘foreign intelligence \nexception’ to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement,” and collecting cases). \n \n23  Mot. Suppress (Doc. 520, at 27, 30)(there is no “special needs” exception to the warrant requirement for foreign \n  intelligence and “not basis to conclude” the requirement is unworkable here). \n \n24  “Foreign intelligence information” is defined under FISA as information that “relates to, and if concerning a United \n  States person is necessary to, the ability of the United States to protect against ... an actual or potential attack ... \nsabotage,  international  terrorism,  or  the  international  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  ...,  or \nclandestine intelligence activities.” § 1801(e)(1). It is also information with respect to a foreign power ... that relates \nto, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to ... the national defense or the security of the United \nStates.” § 1801(e)(2). \n \n25  Notification of its designation appears at 70 Fed.

Leedy, Assistant Federal Public\nDefender, and pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e) and 1825(f), respectfully requests the\nsuppression of any evidence obtained or derived from electronic surveillance or\nphysical searches conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\n(FISA) (50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811, 1821-1829), sought to be offered into evidence, or\notherwise used or disclosed by the government.  As grounds he states as follows:\nOn February 7, 2012, the government filed a “Notice of Intent to Use Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Information,” stating their intent to “offer into evidence or\notherwise use or disclose in any proceedings in the above captioned matter information\nobtained and derived from electronic surveillance and physical search conducted\npursuant to” FISA.  The government’s notice was provided pursuant to 50 U.S.C.\n§§ 1806(c) and 1825(d), which refer to the notification requirements for the use of FISA \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 34\ninformation acquired from electronic surveillance and physical searches, respectively. \nDoc. 12.\n50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e) and 1825(f) provide that “[a]ny person against whom\nevidence obtained or derived from” FISA acquired electronic surveillance or physical\nsearch “to which he is an aggrieved person1 is to be, or has been, introduced or\notherwise used or disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any\ncourt . . . may move to suppress the evidence obtained or derived from such search on\nthe grounds that the information was unlawfully acquired; or the physical search was\nnot made in conformity with an order of authorization or approval.”2\nAll evidence obtained and derived from FISA surveillance or searches should be\nsuppressed because the FISA applications may fail to establish probable cause that Mr.\nMuhtorov is an “agent of a foreign power,” the applications may contain intentional or\n1 An “[a]ggrieved person” is “a person who is the target of an electronic\nsurveillance or any other person whose communications or activities were subject to\nelectronic surveillance.”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(k)\n2  50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g) provide that whenever a court is notified of\nthe government’s intent to enter into evidence, or otherwise use, information obtained\nthrough electronic surveillance or physical searches made pursuant to FISA, or\nwhenever any motion to suppress such evidence is made pursuant to 50 U.S.C.\n§§ 1806(e), or 1825(f), the “United States district court . . . shall, notwithstanding any\nother provision of law, if the Attorney General files an affidavit under oath that\ndisclosure or any adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United\nStates, review in camera and ex parte the application, order, and such other materials\nrelating to the physical search as may be necessary to determine whether the physical\nsearch of the aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted.”  50 U.S.C.\n§§ 1806(f) and 1825(g) further provide that “[i]n making this determination, the court\nmay disclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security procedures and\nprotective orders, portions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the\nphysical search, or may require the Attorney General to provide to the aggrieved person\na summary of such materials, only where such disclosure is necessary to make an\naccurate determination of the legality of the physical search.”\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 34\nreckless material falsehoods or omissions, minimizations procedures may be\ninadequate, and the government may have failed to comply with minimization\nprocedures, the government may not have made the required certifications in FISA\napplications, or those certifications may have been erroneous, and any extensions of\nFISA applications based on searches performed are fruit of the poisonous tree and\nshould be suppressed.3\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis case involves numerous intrusive searches of Mr. Muhtorov's private\nresidence, his computer, email accounts, and personal effects.  According to the\nAffidavit attached to the Complaint (Document No. 1), The Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) began investigating Mr. Muhtorov based on “communications with\nwww.soldiqlar.com website administrator and Islamic Jihad Union (“IJU”) facilitator”\nknown as “Abu Muhammad”.  Doc. 1, pg. 4.  The Affidavit states that “[p]ursuant to\ncourt authorization,” the FBI obtained communications via email regularly accessed\nthrough a laptop computer, and communications originating from Mr. Muhtorov’s phone\nlines.  Id.     \nThe searches at issue violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"   U.S.\nCONST. AM. IV.   The searches appear to have been conducted pursuant to an\n3 Mr. Muhtorov has not had access to the underlying FISA materials, and as\nsuch, can only speculate as to their inadequacies.  If the Court grants Mr. Muhtorov’s\nmotion for access to FISA materials, he will seek leave to supplement this motion.\n3\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 34\nauthorization under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act  (FISA),  which,  as \nshown  herein,  was  designed  for  foreign  intelligence gathering but is increasingly \nused by law enforcement to circumvent the protections of the Fourth Amendment and\nother vital Constitutional protections.\nThis supplement will explain first, as far as can be determined without access to\nthe FISA materials, that the protocol for obtaining a FISA order was not followed in this\ncase and, consequently, that the fruits of the FISA search should be suppressed. \nSecond, the numerous reasons why the defense should be given access to the FISA\nmaterials in this case.  And finally, why this Court should rule that FISA is\nunconstitutional on its face and as applied in this case.\nII. FISA OVERVIEW\nFISA, enacted in 1978, established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n(FISC), a unique type of court that operates in secret and in which the government is\nthe only entity permitted to appear.  FISA authorizes issuance of two types of warrants\nthat may be issued by the FISC – those allowing electronic surveillance and those\nallowing physical searches.  Both types of warrants are at issue in this case, as the\nComplaint establishes that electronic and physical searches occurred prior to the\nissuance of a warrant and pursuant to \"legally authorized surveillance\" (i.e., FISA). \nComplaint Affidavit (Doc. No. 3) at  17 (electronic surveillance), 31 (physical searches).\nThe statutory prerequisites of FISA are the same in most respects for both\nelectronic and physical intrusions.  Any application to the FISC must be made under\noath by a federal officer and contain certain information and certifications. 50 U.S.C. \n4\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 34\n§§ 1804 and 1823.   In brief, an application for electronic surveillance or a physical\nsearch must:\n• provide the identity of the Federal officer making the application;\n• state the identity or description of the target;\n• include a  statement of  the  facts  and  circumstances relied  upon  by \nthe applicant to justify his belief that the target of the search or\nsurveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and each of\nthe facilities or places at which the electronic surveillance is directed is\nbeing used, or is about to be used by a foreign power or an agent of a\nforeign power;\n• provide a \"statement of proposed minimization procedures\";\n• provide a description of the nature of the information sought and the type\nof communications or activities to be subjected to surveillance;\n• set  forth  \"certifications\" by  the  Assistant  to  the  President for  National\nSecurity Affairs, an executive branch official or officials designated by the\nPresident from among those executive officers employed in the area of\nnational security or defense and appointed by the President with the\nadvice and consent of the Senate, stating as follows:\n(A) the  certifying official  deems the  information sought to  be \nforeign intelligence information;\n(B) a significant purpose of the search or surveillance is to\nobtain foreign intelligence information;\n(C) such information cannot reasonably be obtained by normal\ninvestigative techniques,\n(D) the type of foreign intelligence information being sought\naccording to the categories describe in section 1801(e); and\n(E) the basis for the certification that -\n(i) the  information  sought  is  the  type  of  foreign \nintelligence information designated; and\n5\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 34\n(ii) such  information  cannot  reasonably  be  obtained \nby  normal investigative techniques.\n50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a), 1823(a).   \nThe statute also requires a summary statement of the means by which the\nsurveillance will be effected and a statement whether physical entry is required to effect\nthe surveillance, including:\n• a statement of facts concerning all previous applications that have been\nmade to any judge under this statute and action taken on each previous\napplication;\n• the specific period of time for which the electronic surveillance is required\nto be maintained.\nId. § 1804(a)(7) - (9). \nThe Attorney General must personally review the application and determine that it\nsatisfies the criteria and requirements set forth in the statute. Id. at § 1804(d).\nA. Requirements to Obtain a FISA Order and  Standard for\nSuppression of FISA Evidence.\nAt the outset it will be helpful to emphasize some of FISA's more important\nrequirements.  Before the FISA court can approve electronic surveillance or a physical\nsearch, it must make several important findings.  One of the more important aspects of\na FISA order is that the government must show facts that \"the target of the electronic\nsurveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power\" and that each of the\nfacilities or places at which the electronic surveillance or physical search is directed is\nbeing used, or is about to be used, by the foreign power or an agent thereof.\n50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(3); 1824(a)(2).\n6\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 34\nAdditionally, FISA requires a \"certification or certifications by the Assistant to the\nPresident for National Security Affairs, an executive branch official or officials\ndesignated by the President from among those executive officers employed in the area\nof national security or defense and appointed by the President with the advice and\nconsent of the Senate, or the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, if\ndesignated by the President as a certifying official,\" that a significant purpose of the\nsurveillance or search is to obtain foreign intelligence information.\"  50 U.S.C.\n§§ 1804(a)(6)(B), 1823(a)(6)(B).\nAlso importantly, FISA authorizes any \"aggrieved person\" to move to suppress\nevidence obtained or derived from electronic surveillance or a physical search on the\ngrounds that the information was unlawfully acquired, or the surveillance or search was\nnot made in conformity with an order of authorization or approval.  Id. at §§ 1806(e),\n1825(f).  FISA defines the phrase \"aggrieved person\" as \"a person who is the target of\nan electronic surveillance or any other person whose communications or activities were\nsubject to electronic surveillance.\"  Id. at § 1801(k).\nB. This Court's Standard of Review of the FISA Application and\nProcedure is De Novo.\nThis Court should review the FISA applications and orders de novo.   United\nStates v. Hammound, 381 F.3d 316, 332 (4th Cir. 2004) (noting district court's de novo\nreview and conducting its own de novo review of FISA materials), vacated on other\ngrounds, 543 U.S. 1097 (2005); United States v. Squillacote, 221 F.3d 542, 554 (4th\nCir. 2000) (same).   Indeed, a reviewing  court  should  conduct  essentially  the  same \nreview of the FISA application and materials that the FISC conducted.  In re Grand Jury\n7\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 34\nProceedings of the Special April 2002 Grand Jury, 347 F.3d 197, 204-05 (7th Cir.\n2003).  And \"no deference [should be] accorded to the FISC's probable cause\ndeterminations.\"  United States v. Rosen, 447 F.Supp. 2d 538, 545 (E.D. Va. 2006). \nThe need for de novo review is critically important if this Court declines to permit the\ndefense participation in the suppression issues.  Id.  (\"de novo review is particularly\nimportant \"especially given that the review is ex parte and thus unaided by the\nadversarial process.\"); see also United States v. Warsame, 547 F.Supp. 2d 982, 990\n(D. Minn. 2008).\nAdditionally, this Court must give an exacting review of the FISA materials\nbecause at this stage, the FISA activity has moved out of the realm of intelligence\ngathering and is being used to obtain a criminal conviction.  The focus now should be\nthe rights of the defendant against whom the government is acting, and not the\ninterests of intelligence.\nIII. ACCESS TO FISA DISCOVERY IS REQUIRED TO LITIGATE SUPPRESSION\nISSUES AND IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO CONFORM WITH DUE PROCESS\nOF LAW.\nThe district court has the discretion to disclose portions of relevant materials,\nunder appropriate protective procedures, if it decides that such disclosure is necessary\nto make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance, or is otherwise\nrequired by due process.  50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) (electronic surveillance), 1825(g)\n(physical searches); United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93, 128 (2d Cir. 2009).  This\nsection will show that both principles require that the defense have access to the FISA\nmaterials in this case.\n8\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 34\nA. Disclosure of FISA Materials is Necessary to Accurately\nDetermine the Legality of the FISA Surveillance and Searches.\nIn determining the legality of surveillance, \"the court may disclose to the\naggrieved person, under appropriate security procedures and protective orders,\nportions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance only\nwhere such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of\nthe surveillance.\"  50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) (electronic surveillance), § 1825(g) (physical\nsearches).  Disclosure is, therefore, warranted when a court needs a defense attorney's\ninput to decide whether to suppress evidence obtained through a FISA order.\n  While  courts  have  not  allowed  defense  participation  in  suppression \nhearings, the decisions have articulated several principles that support defense\nparticipation on Mr. Muhtorov's behalf.  For example, in both United States v. Belfield,\n692 F.2d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir. 1982), and United States v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476 (9th\nCir. 1987), the courts identified issues such as misrepresentations of fact, vague\nidentification, or records showing over broad surveillance may require disclosure to the\ndefense.  Here, there are many potential bases for suppression based on unlawful \nsurveillance.  There are, furthermore, several complicated issues that make the\ndefense's input necessary.\nAccordingly, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f), the defendant asks this court to\norder the government to provide the following materials: All applications, extensions,\norders, and related materials underlying the electronic surveillance of the defendant\nconducted pursuant to FISA, as well as applications for such surveillance of any\nthird-party target which intercepted defendant.\n9\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 34\nB. Input from the Defense is necessary to make an accurate\ndetermination as to whether Mr. Muhtorov is a foreign power or\nagent thereof or if a \"significant purpose\" of the FISA application\nwas foreign intelligence gathering.\nDefense input is necessary for an accurate determination of the suppression\nissues raised above – that Mr. Muhtorov is not a foreign power or agent of a foreign\npower and that a \"significant purpose\" of the FISA application was not foreign\nintelligence gathering.\nWith respect to both physical searches and electronic surveillance, FISA requires\nthat a court find probable cause to believe that the target of the investigation is a foreign\npower or agent of a foreign power, and that the facility or place at which the surveillance\nor search is directed is being used or is about to be used by the target.  50 U.S.C.\n§§ 1805(a)(2)(A)-(B), 1824(a)(2)(A)-(B).  The FISA application here may be insufficient\nas to whether Mr. Muhtorov can be reasonably viewed as a foreign power or agent of a\nforeign power.\n  Section 1801(a)-(b) provides several definitions and categories of \"foreign\npower\" and \"agent of a foreign power.\"  None of those definitions apply to Mr.\nMuhtorov.  Indeed, the only category that can even arguably apply to Mr. Muhtorov is\nthe \"agent of a foreign power\" definition provided in § 1801(b)(1)(C).  That definition\nprovides that an agent of a foreign power includes a person who \"engages in\ninternational terrorism or activities in preparation therefore.\"  \"International terrorism,\" is\ndefined as activities that:\n(1) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of\nthe criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a\n10\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 34\ncriminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or\nany State;\n(2) appear to be intended-\n(A) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n(B) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or\ncoercion; or\n(C) to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or\nkidnapping; and\n(3)  occur totally outside the United States, or transcend national boundaries \nin terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they\nappear intended to coerce or intimidate, or the locale in which their\nperpetrators operate or seek asylum.  50 U.S.C. § 1801(c).\nAs enacted in 1978, FISA applied to interceptions the \"primary purpose\" of which was\nforeign intelligence.  However, as amended in 2001 by the USA PATRIOT Act, the\nstatute now applies to interceptions that have international intelligence gathering as a\n\"significant purpose.\"  See United States v. Ning Wen, 477 F.3d 896, 897 (7th Cir.\n2007); 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6)(B).\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (\"FISCR\"), has concluded\nthat the amended statute allows domestic use of intercepted evidence provided that a\n\"significant\" international objective is present at the time of the FISA order.   Ning Wen,\n477 F.3d at 897 (citing Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717 (F.I.S.Ct.Rev.2002)).  The FISCR\nhas further stated that the \"significant purpose\" test, \"impose[s] a requirement that the\ngovernment have a measurable foreign intelligence purpose, other than just criminal\n11\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 34\nprosecution of even foreign intelligence crimes\" in seeking to obtain a FISA order. \nSealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 735 (F.I.S.Ct.Rev.2002). \nThis Court should not be persuaded by any argument that this was strictly a\n\"terrorism\" investigation and thus had a significant foreign intelligence objective.  Thus, \nthe mere fact that a certain investigation is in relation to \"terrorism\" does not establish a\n\"significant\" foreign connection under FISA. \n  In deciding probable cause in a search warrant context, courts are instructed to\nrely on common  sense.  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 239 (1983). Here, common \nsense and objectivity shows that this was a criminal investigation from the beginning. \nCommon sense further shows that, in this case, FISA was used as a tool to circumvent\nthe United States Constitution and procedures in place to protect the public and\ndefendants from government overreaching.  Common sense defies how a foreign\nintelligence-gathering mission turns into a full-blown criminal prosecution within days.  \nIn sum, looking at the entirety of this investigation, it is obvious that its sole purpose\nwas to build a criminal case, and had no relevance to foreign intelligence gathering. \nAccordingly, FISA was improperly used and the fruits of the FISA searches and\nsurveillance should be suppressed.\nThese are complex issues that involve statutory interpretation and legal\nprinciples to which the defense can, and should, be able to contribute.  Both arguments\naddress issues where there is little, if any, guidance from the Tenth Circuit.  And in a\nsimilar vein, few courts throughout the nation have addressed these issues.  Therefore,\nthis Court would benefit from the adversarial process (\"the basic framework of the\nAmerican criminal justice system\") in deciding these issues.  United States v. Michelle's\n12\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 34\nLounge, 39 F.3d 684, 699 (7th Cir. 1994); see also United States v. Thompson, 827\nF.2d 1254, 1259 (9th Cir. 1987) (\"[a]dversary proceedings do in fact take more time,\nand they are more cumbersome, but with good reason: The adversary process helps us\nget at the truth\").\n  Furthermore, there are issues that have not been raised as suppression issues\nthat may very well invalidate the FISA investigation upon further analysis.  These issues\nare addressed below.\nC. Defense Involvement is Necessary to Address why the information\ncould not be obtained by normal investigative procedures.\nAn important check on governmental abuse of FISA is that it may only be used\nwhen the Attorney General certifies, \"that such information cannot reasonably be\nobtained by normal investigative procedures.\"  50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(6)(C);\n1823(a)(6)(C).  A defense perspective is necessary to determine why normal\ninvestigative procedures could not be used in this case and to refute the government's\nexplanation for why it relied on FISA.\nD. Defense involvement is necessary to address questions related to\nminimization of government intrusion in this case.\nUnder FISA, as under the Title III wiretap statute, the government is required to\ndemonstrate it has minimized its intrusions.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h); 1802 \n(a)(1)(C);1804(a)(4); 1805(a)(3); 1806(a); 1821(4); 1822(a)(1)(A)(iii); 1823(a)(4);\n1824(a)(3), and (c)(2)(A); 1825(a); 1861(g); 1881a(e) and (g)(2)(A)(ii) and (i)(2)(C);\n1881b(b)(D) and (c)(1)(C) and (c)(3)(C) and (d)(2); 1881c(b)(4) and (c)(1)(C) and\n(c)(3)(C) and (d)(2).\n13\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 34\n [The] minimization procedures are designed to protect, as\nfar as reasonable, against the acquisition, retention, and\ndissemination of nonpublic information which is not foreign\nintelligence information. If the data is not foreign intelligence\ninformation as defined by the statute, the procedures are to\nensure that the government does not use the information to\nidentify the target or third party, unless such identification is\nnecessary to properly understand or assess the foreign\nintelligence information that is collected.  \nIn re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 731 (citing § 1801(h)(2)).\nThe statute requires three specific types of minimization to protect distinct\ninterests.  50 U.S.C. § 1801.  First, by minimizing acquisition, Congress envisioned that\nsurveillance should be discontinued where the target is not a party to the\ncommunications.  Second, by minimizing retention, Congress intended that information\nacquired, which is not necessary for obtaining, producing, or disseminating foreign \nintelligence information, be destroyed where feasible.  Third, by minimizing\ndissemination, Congress intended that even lawfully retained information should only be\ndivulged to those officials with a specific need.  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at\n731. \"The FISA minimization procedures were enacted 'generally to parallel the\nminimization provision in existing [electronic surveillance] law.'\"  United States v.\nThomson, 752 F. Supp. 75,80 (W.D.N.Y. 1990) (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-701, at 39\n(1978), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4008).\nIn this case, based on the limited information known to the defense, the concern\nis that the surveillance was extremely overly broad, and there was little to no effort\nmade to minimize the amount of intrusion to information related foreign intelligence\ngathering.  In sum, this is one of those cases where defense input is necessary\nbecause there was surveillance of such a \"significant amount of nonforeign intelligence\n14\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 34\ninformation\" that it is apparent that the minimization procedures were not followed.\nUnited States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\nE. Due  Process  requires  disclosure  of  FISA  material  as  well  as \nany  classified information to the defense.  \nFISA requires disclosure \"to the extent that due process requires discovery or\ndisclosure.\"  18 U.S.C. §§ 1806(g), 1825(h), 1845(g)(2).  In the contest between\ndisclosure of state secrets and the defendant's right to a fair trial, the latter wins out.   \nAs the Supreme Court has long recognized, \"the Government can invoke its evidentiary\nprivileges only at the price of letting the defendant go free . . . it is unconscionable to\nallow [the Government] to under take prosecution and then invoke its governmental\nprivileges to deprive the accused of anything which might be material to his defense.\" \nUnited States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 12 (1953).  This principal has remained\nunchanged over time.  In fact, the Second Circuit recently reiterated that in a criminal\nprosecution the defense must have access to information that is \"helpful or material\" to\nthe defense, regardless of whether such information is a state secret.  United States v.\nAref, 533 F.3d 72, 80 (2d Cir. 2008).  Being \"helpful or material\" does not necessarily\nrise to the level of the government's obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\n(1963), because \"information can be helpful without being favorable in the Brady\nsense.\"  Id.  Thus, the government must disclose any and all helpful information to the\ndefense, regardless of whether it is classified.  Id.; see also United States v. Varca, 896\nF.2d 900, 905 (5th Cir. 1990).\nMoreover, the government is given four options in a case that involves classified\ninformation that is material to the defense, in accordance with the procedures defined\n15\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 34\nby the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA).  In such a case, the government\ncan either: (1) disclose the material to counsel; (2) declassify the material and disclose\nit; (3) in some circumstances, provide an unclassified summary of the material; or (4) if\nit refuses any of the three disclosure options, it faces exclusion of the evidence or\ndismissal of its case.  18 U.S.C. app. III at § 6(c) and (e).  In a case such as this, where\nstate secrets are expected to be elicited from the government, the proper procedure is\nto follow CIPA rather than to preclude discovery and examination of materials by the\ndefense.  See, e.g., United States v. Poindexter, 732 F.Supp.\n142, 154-55 (D.D.C. 1990).\nThe importance of a defense perspective in assessing the materials in this case\nthat are helpful to Mr. Muhtorov's defense cannot be overstated.  The defense will\nprovide a unique position to evaluate the plethora of electronic surveillance present in\nthis case and assess its helpfulness to Mr. Muhtorov.  Alderman v. United States, 394\nU.S. 165, 182-84 (1969).  In Alderman, the Supreme Court recognized that \"the need\nfor adversary inquiry is increased by the complexity of the issues presented for\nadjudication, and by the consequent inadequacy of ex parte procedures as a means for\ntheir accurate resolution, the displacement of well-informed advocacy necessarily\nbecomes less justifiable.\"  Id. at 183-84.  The Court recognized that a district court's\nability to represent the interests of a defendant is limited by the fact that \n[a]n apparently innocent phrase, a chance remark, a\nreference to what appears to be a neutral person or event,\nthe identity of a caller or the individual on the other end of a\ntelephone, or even the manner of speaking or using words \n16\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 34\nmay have special significance to one who knows the more\nintimate facts of an accused's life.\nAlderman, 394 U.S. at 182.  In this case, \"the volume of the material to be examined\nand the complexity and difficulty of the judgments involved\" requires a defense\nperspective and the protections provided by the adversarial process.  Id. at 182 n.14.\nFinally, it must be noted that if the Court declines to permit the defense its due\nprocess right to access the FISA information to determine its helpfulness, the Court\nmust \"err on the side of protecting the interests of the Defendant,\" in deciding what is to\nbe disclosed, again because of the ex parte nature of FISA proceedings are not\nadequate to protect defendants.  United States v. Hanjuan Jin, 791 F.Supp.2d 612, 620\n(N.D.Ill. 2011).\nIV. FISA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.\nAlthough a number of the challenges raised here have been rejected by other\ncourts both before and after the Patriot Act Amendments to FISA in 2001, the Court\nshould consider the claims in light of the facts of this case, amendments to the Patriot\nAct, and the lack of Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit authority addressing FISA issues.\nA. The \"Significant Purpose\" Standard Violates the Fourth\nAmendment's Prohibition on Unreasonable Searches and Seizures.\nBefore FISA was enacted, and for the first 25 years of its existence, the \"primary\npurpose\" for surveillance or searches was required to be intelligence gathering.  United\nStates v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 912-13 (4th Cir. 1980).  The non-criminal\npurpose standard was essential to the cases upholding FISA's constitutionality.  In the\nPatriot Act of 2001 and a subsequent decision of the FISCR, the primary purpose test\n17\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 34\nwas abandoned.  The change requires reconsideration of FISA's constitutionality given\nthe use of FISA for normal criminal purposes for governmental intrusions, which\nimplicate the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments.\n1. The \"primary purpose\" standard was essential to the\nConstitutionality of FISA.\nPrior to the amendments to FISA pursuant to the Patriot Act  in 2001, \ninformation obtained pursuant to a FISA investigation could be used in a criminal\nproceeding only if the \"primary purpose\" of the FISA investigation was foreign\nintelligence gathering.  United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 77 (2d Cir. 1984).\nCritically important, this \"primary purpose\" standard arose from pre-FISA case law\nholding that warrantless surveillance by the executive branch was permissible only if the\npurpose of the surveillance was primarily to gather foreign intelligence information. \nSee, e.g., United States v. Butenko, 494 F.2d 593, 601 (3d Cir.1974) (noting that the\nsurveillance was conducted \"solely for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence\ninformation\"); United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908, 915 (4th Cir.1980)\n(finding that the executive branch is excused from the warrant requirement only when\n\"the object of the search or the surveillance is a foreign power,\" and \"the surveillance is\nconducted 'primarily' for foreign intelligence reasons\"); United States v. Brown, 484\nF.2d 418, 427 (5th Cir. 1973) (\"The serious step of recognizing the legality of a\nwarrantees wiretap can be justified only when, as in the case before us, the foreign and\nsensitive nature of the government surveillance is crystal clear.\") (Goldberg, J.,\nconcurring).  Because each of these cases either predates FISA or addresses searches\nthat predated FISA, logically speaking, the \"primary purpose\" restriction arose from\n18\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 34\nConstitutional, rather than statutory interpretation, concerns. Indeed, as the Fourth\nCircuit made clear:\n[T]he executive can proceed without a warrant only if it is\nattempting primarily to obtain foreign intelligence from\nforeign powers or their assistants. We think that the unique\nrole of the executive in foreign affairs and the separation of\npowers will not permit this court to allow the executive less\non the facts of this case, but we also are convinced that the\nFourth Amendment will not permit us to grant the executive\nbranch more.  \nTruong, 629 F.2d at 916.\n2. FISA's original language.\nAs initially enacted, in 1978, FISA required that \"the purpose of the surveillance\nis to obtain foreign intelligence information.\"  However, in order to comply with the\nConstitution, courts interpreted this language as requiring that the \"primary purpose\" of\na FISA investigation to be directed at obtaining foreign intelligence information.  United\nStates v. Johnson, 952 F.2d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Pelton, 835 F.2d\n1067, 1074-76 (4th Cir. 1987).  This test \"ensured that law enforcement officials \navailed themselves of FISA's more flexible certification procedures only if they primarily\nsought to obtain foreign intelligence information.\"  United States v. Warsame, 547\nF.Supp. 2d 982, 995 (D. Minn. 2008).  In other words, it was essential to the\nconstitutionality of FISA.\n3. The \"significant purpose\" standard violates the Fourth\nAmendment on its face and as applied in this case.\nThis \"primary purpose\" test – which has its basis in the Constitution - was the\nFISA procedure until 2001 when the Patriot Act amended FISA to allow electronic\n19\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 34\nsurveillance and searches where, \"a significant purpose\" of the surveillance or search\nwas to obtain foreign intelligence information. 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(7)(B),\n1823(a)(7)(B).  As the FISCR has noted, the government advocated for this\namendment to FISA, whereby the article \"the\" was replaced with the article \"a\" before\nthe word \"purpose,\" \"in order to avoid the requirement of meeting the 'primary purpose'\ntest.\"  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 732.\nUnder the new \"significant purpose\" test, as interpreted by the FISCR, the\ngovernment can obtain a FISA warrant provided that it has some \"measurable foreign\nintelligence purpose, other than just criminal prosecution,\" in order to obtain a FISA\nwarrant.  Id. at 735.  The test is satisfied, \"[s]o long as the government entertains a\nrealistic option of dealing with the agent other than through criminal prosecution.\"  Id. at\n735.  The standard, as other courts have recognized, problematically seems to allows\nFISA surveillance where the primary purpose is criminal prosecution.   See, e.g.,\nWarsame, 547 F.Supp. 2d at 998.  This standard cannot withstand a Fourth\nAmendment challenge.\nAs shown above, the \"primary purpose\" test is based on the Constitution and\npre-dates FISA.  As the Fourth Circuit stated, the primary purpose test is as far as the\nFourth Amendment will permit the Government to go in being permitted to physically\nsearch and electronically monitor an individual without a warrant.  Truong,  629  F.2d  at \n916.  Logically, then, the \"significant purpose\" test, which permits the government to\nobtain authority to physically search and electronically monitor an individual without a \n20\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 34\nwarrant and with the primary purpose of criminally prosecuting them, In re Sealed Case,\n310 F.3d at 732, is unconstitutional.\nThe inherent danger in FISA's significant purpose test is that, in a wide range of\ncriminal investigations, the government can now effect an end-run around the Fourth\nAmendment merely by asserting a desire to gather foreign intelligence information from\nthe person it in fact intends to prosecute.  This has prompted one court to hold that\nFISA is unconstitutional.  Mayfield v. United States, 504 F.Supp.2d 1023, 1038 (D.Or.\n2007), rev'd on other grounds, 599 F.3d 964 (striking  down  Patriot  Act  amendment \nbecause \"the primary purpose of the electronic surveillance and physical searching of\n[plaintiff]'s home was to gather evidence to prosecute him for crimes\").  And the same\nbasis led to another court to having \"very significant concerns that the 'significant\npurpose' standard violates the Fourth Amendment.\"  Warsame, 547 F.Supp. 2d at\n998 (but declining to reach the issue because, on the case before it, the FISA\ninvestigation satisfied the primary purpose test).\nThe \"significant purpose\" test, therefore, renders FISA unconstitutional on its\nface and as applied in this case.  It is unconstitutional on its face because under the\n\"significant purpose\" test, every FISA surveillance order empowers the government to \ndisregard the Fourth Amendment even if its primary purpose is to gather evidence of a\ncrime.   In addition, every FISA order fails to satisfy several of the Fourth Amendment's\nrequirements – the orders do not qualify as warrants, fail to require probable cause, fail\nthe particularity requirement because of their lengthy duration, and provide inadequate\nnotice.  See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (a statute is \n21\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 34\nunconstitutional on its face when \"no set of circumstances exists under which the Act\nwould be valid\").\n  The significant purpose test, furthermore, renders FISA unconstitutional as\napplied in this case because the investigation of Mr. Muhtorov was at least primarily, if\nnot fully, criminal. Mr. Muhtorov operated exclusively within the United States and there\nis no apparent foreign intelligence gathering connection.  The FISA application in this\ncase, therefore, must have relied on the \"significant purpose\" test, and would not have\nbeen upheld under the former \"primary purpose\" test.    Accordingly, this Court should\nrule that the FISA \"significant purpose\" standard as applied in this case is\nunconstitutional.\nB.     FISA Violates Numerous Other Fourth Amendment Protections.\n1. FISA   Authorizes   Warrants   Without   the   Meaningful  \nJudicial   Review Required Under The Fourth Amendment.\nIn order to conduct a search or surveillance in an ordinary criminal investigation,\nthe government must obtain the prior authorization of a neutral, disinterested magistrate\nwho has the authority to determine whether the requirements of Rule 41 or Title III have\nbeen satisfied.  See FED. R. CRIM. P. 41 (governing physical searches in criminal\ninvestigations); 18 U.S.C. §§ 2518(1)(b), (2) & (3) (governing electronic surveillance in\ncriminal investigations); see Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13-14 (1948) (\"The\npoint of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not\nthat it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable\nmen draw from evidence.  Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be \n22\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 34\ndrawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer\nengaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\").\nFISA reduces the authority of judges reviewing warrants issued under its\nprovisions.  The FISC does not have full authority to determine whether, in any\nparticular investigation, the FBI has satisfied the requirements of FISA.  The\ngovernment satisfies most of FISA's requirements simply by certifying that the\nrequirements are met.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6); 1823(a)(6) (enumerating necessary\ncertifications).\nWhile certain (but not all) of these certifications must be accompanied by \"a\nstatement of the basis for the certification,\"  50 U.S.C. § 1804(a)(6)(E), the statute\nmakes clear that the FISA court is not to fully scrutinize such statements, but rather is\nto defer to the government's certification unless it is \"clearly erroneous on the basis of \nthe statement made under § 1804(a)(6)(E).\"  18 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(4).  As the FISCR\nhas acknowledged, \"this standard of review is not, of course, comparable to a probable\ncause finding by the judge.\"  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 739 (quoting H. R. REP.\nNO. 95-1283, at 80 (1978)).  Prior to the Patriot Act Amendment, it may have been\nreasonable to limit judicial review of warrant applications.  Once, however, the use of\nwarrants was permitted even when the \"primary purpose\" was no longer intelligence\ngathering, the rationale for limiting the judiciary's role can no longer stand under the\nFourth Amendment.  The protections of the people's right against government\nintrusions for criminal investigatory purposes required by the Fourth Amendment must\nbe present if the government is to use evidence in a criminal prosecution.  \"A search\nprosecuted in violation of the Constitution is not made lawful by what it brings to light;\n23\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 34\nand the doctrine has never been recognized by this court, nor can it be tolerated under\nour constitutional system, that evidences of crime discovered by a federal officer in\nmaking a search without lawful warrant may be used against the victim of the unlawful\nsearch where a timely challenge has been interposed.\"  Byars v. United States, 273\nU.S. 28, 29-30 (1927).\nSince surveillance and searches conducted pursuant to FISA here were likely\nconducted without meaningful prior judicial review, they were unreasonable under the\nFourth Amendment.\n2. FISA Orders Do Not Qualify as Warrants Under the Fourth\nAmendment.\nFISC surveillance orders are not warrants within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment.  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 741 (acknowledging that FISA orders\n\"may not be . . .'warrant[s]' contemplated by the Fourth Amendment\").  The Supreme\nCourt has held that a warrant must be issued by a neutral, detached magistrate; must\nbe based on a demonstration of probable cause; must relate to a particular offense;\nand must particularly describe the things to be seized as well as the place to be\nsearched. Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238, 255 (1979). FISC orders do not satisfy\nthese requirements.\nOn the contrary, and as clearly demonstrated by this case, FISA empowers the\ngovernment to conduct the most intrusive kinds of surveillance with lesser judicial\nreview then required by the Constitution, without showing criminal probable cause, and\nwithout meeting particularity requirements. Because FISC orders are not warrants,\nsearches conducted under FISA are presumptively unreasonable.  See, e.g., Payton v.\n24\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 34\nNew York, 445 U.S. 573, 586 (1980); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762-63\n(1969).  The surveillance at issue in this case cannot overcome that presumption.\n3. FISA Warrants Do Not Satisfy The Particularity Requirement.\nThe electronic surveillance and searches in this case were substantial.  As the\nComplaint Affidavit indicates, Mr. Muhtorov's home was searched on at least two\noccasions, his email account was searched, his personal journals were searched, and\nhis computer files were searched.  The duration and scope of these intrusions,\nobviously, was not strictly limited.   Such surveillance violated the Fourth Amendment's\nparticularity requirement.\n  The Fourth Amendment ordinarily prohibits the government from conducting\nintrusive surveillance unless it first obtains a warrant describing with particularity the\nthings to be seized as well as the place to be searched.  Berger v. New York, 388 U.S.\n41, 58 (1967) (noting that Fourth Amendment particularity requirement was intended to\nprevent the government's reliance on \"general warrants\" that allow \"the seizure of one\nthing under a warrant describing another\").  In Berger, the Supreme Court stated that\nthe importance of the particularity requirement \"is especially great in the case of\neavesdropping.\"  Id. at 56.  The Court explained: \"[B]y its very nature eavesdropping\ninvolves an intrusion on privacy that is broad in scope.\"  Id.  \"[T]he  indiscriminate use of\nsuch devices in law enforcement raises grave constitutional questions under the Fourth\nand Fifth Amendments, and imposes a heavier responsibility on this Court in its\nsupervision of the fairness of procedures.\"  Id.  \n25\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 34\nWith respect to eavesdropping devices and wiretaps, the particularity\nrequirement demands not simply that the government describe in detail the\ncommunications it intends to intercept, but also that the duration of the intercept be\nstrictly limited.  See Berger, 388 U.S. at 58-60.  Title III, which Congress enacted shortly\nafter Berger was decided, limits the term of surveillance orders to 30 days.  18 U.S.C.\n§ 2518(5).  FISA, by contrast, authorizes surveillance terms of up to 90 or 120 days or\neven one year.  50 U.S.C. § 1805(d)(1); 1824(d)(1).  To the extent FISA is read to\npermit issuance of a warrant - or an extension - without the type of particularity required\nunder Title III, it would violate the Constitution.  But see Mubayyid, 521 F. Supp. 2d at\n138.\n4. Surveillance was Conducted Without Compliance with the\nFourth Amendment's  Probable Cause Requirement.\nThe Fourth Amendment ordinarily prohibits the government from conducting\nintrusive surveillance without first demonstrating criminal probable cause - probable\ncause to believe that \"the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or\nconviction for a particular offense.\"  See Dalia, 441 U.S. at 255.   Although the\ngovernment's primary purpose in this case was to obtain evidence of criminal activity, it\nfailed to satisfy the criminal probable cause requirement.\nFISA authorizes the government to conduct intrusive surveillance if it can show\nwhat is known as \"foreign intelligence probable cause\" – probable cause to believe that\nthe surveillance target is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.  See 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1805(a)(3)(A).   The statute does not require the government to advance any reason\nwhatsoever – let alone probable cause – to believe that its surveillance will yield\n26\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 34\ninformation about a particular criminal offense.  Indeed, foreign-intelligence probable \ncause bears only a passing resemblance to criminal probable cause.  In response to a\nFreedom of Information Act request filed by the ACLU and others in August 2002, the\nFBI released, among other things, a document from the FBI's National Security Law\nUnit entitled, \"What do I have to do to get a FISA?\"  The document states, in relevant\npart:\nProbable cause in the FISA context is similar to, but not the same as, probable\ncause in criminal cases. Where a U.S. person is believed to be an agent of a\nforeign power, there must be probable cause to believe that he is engaged in\ncertain activities, for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or\nmay involve a violation of U.S. criminal law. The phrase \"involve or may involve\"\nindicates that the showing of [nexus to] criminality does not apply to FISA\napplications in the same way it does to ordinary criminal cases. As a result, there\nis no showing or finding that a crime has been or is being committed, as in the\ncase of a search or seizure for law enforcement purposes. The activity identified\nby the government in the FISA context may not yet involve criminality, but if a\nreasonable person would believe that such activity is likely to lead to illegal\nactivities, that would suffice. In addition, and with respect to the nexus to\ncriminality required by the definitions of \"agent of a foreign power,\" the\ngovernment need not show probable cause as to each and every element of the\ncrime involved or about to be involved.\n  \n\"What do I have to do to get a FISA?,\" at 2 (Document released by FBI in response to\nAugust 21Freedom of Information Act request submitted by ACLU et al.).  \nIt is clear that foreign-intelligence probable cause is not \"probable cause\" within\nthe ordinary meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The surveillance at issue in this case\nwas not premised on criminal probable cause and accordingly was unreasonable within\nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n27\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 34\nC. The Ex Parte, In Camera FISA Process Violates Due Process, A\nDefendant's Rights To Be Present At All Critical Stages Of The\nCriminal Process, And His Right To The Effective Assistance Of\nCounsel.\nFISA authorizes the unprecedented exclusion of the accused from critical stages\nof the prosecution, including review of the motion to suppress evidence.  The \npost-indictment procedure, in a criminal prosecution, is conducted ex parte and in\ncamera and without the defendant ever having the right to even see the warrants or\naffidavits he is challenging.  To permit Muhtorov's motion to proceed in this manner\nwould violate his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  Fundamental to due process is the\nright to notice and an opportunity to be heard. See LaChance v. Erickson, 522 U.S. 262\n(1998).  The interest at stake is the most fundamental liberty- freedom from\nincarceration.  Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.Ct. 2507, 2518 (2011) (\"Freedom 'from bodily\nrestraint' lies 'at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.'\").  Equally\nfundamental is a defendant's right to be present at, and participate in, all critical stages\nof a criminal prosecution and to be meaningfully assisted by counsel.  See Montejo v.\nLouisiana, 129 S. Ct. 2079, 2085 (2009); Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 523\n(2004).\nTo be sure, the Constitution recognizes some limits on a defendant's\nparticipation in the criminal process.  The government may secure an indictment without\nhis participation.  United States v. Salsedo, 607 F.2d 318, 319 (9th Cir. 1979).  In\nlimited circumstances, the court may review potential evidence ex parte to determine\nwhether it is material to the defense.  United States v. Mejia, 448 F.3d 436, 543-54 \n28\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 34\n(D.C. Cir. 2006).  If it, it must be disclosed or the government loses the opportunity to\nuse it.  Skinner v. Switzer, 131 S. Ct. 1289, 1300 (2011) (citing Brady, 373 U.S. at 87).\nThe FISA limitations on a defendant's participation are different in kind, allowing\nthe court to determine complex constitutional questions in a non-adversarial setting and\nin secret.  The Constitution forbids such a process, as analogous holdings show.\nThe unconstitutionality of the type of process authorized by FISA is supported by United\nStates v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 309 (2d Cir. 2004).  There, in the context of a bail\napplication, the government submitted – and the District Court considered – evidence\nex parte and in camera.  The Court rejected one-sided secret proceedings: “Particularly \nwhere  liberty  is  at  stake,  due  process  demands  that  the individual and the\ngovernment each be afforded the opportunity not only to advance their respective\npositions but to correct or contradict arguments or evidence offered by the other.”  Id. at\n322.   Abuhamra also noted that such a procedure not only violated the defendant's due\nprocess rights but also the right of public access to criminal trials.  Id. at 316 n.3, 323;\nsee also Alderman, 394 U.S. at 182-84.  FISA's ex parte, in camera process, whatever\nits legality in the context of foreign surveillance, cannot constitutionally displace the\ndefendant's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  See United States v.\nCoplon, 185 F.2d 629, 638 (2d Cir. 1950) (finding the refusal to allow the defense to\nsee records the judge reviewed in camera to determine if the \"taps\" led to evidence\nintroduced at trial violated the defendants' constitutional right).  \"Few weapons in the\narsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a government to disclose \n29\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 34\nthe evidence on which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens.\"  Coplon, 185 F.2d at\n638.\nOne of the first cases to consider these arguments under FISA was Belfield.\nThere, the court rejected similar Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims.  692  F.2d  at  148. \nThe court's reasoning was, however, anchored in the fact that \"FISA is concerned with\nforeign intelligence surveillance.\"  Id.  Courts that rejected similar claims after the\nPatriot Act amendments have failed to recognize the change in the statutory criteria. \nSee, e.g., United States v. Kashmiri, No.09 CR 830-4, 2010 WL 4705159 (N.D. Ill.\n2010).  Once Congress expanded the purposes of and standards for surveillance, it\nshifted the constitutional calculus.  As stated in Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 797\n(2008), \"security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom's first principles.\"  Those principles\nsupport the conclusion that FISA no longer passes constitutional muster if it shuts\ncriminal defendants out of the process.\nD. The FISA \"Suppression\" Process Unconstitutionally Interferes With\nThe Article III Judicial Power.\nChief Justice John Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia, noted that the judicial power of\nthe federal courts \"extends to all cases arising under the constitution or a law of the\nUnited States, whoever may be the parties.\"  19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 392 (1821).  FISA\nmay trigger this judicial power, but it cannot constitutionally expand or restrict the scope\nof Article III.  It does both.\nIn considering the constitutionality of FISA's limit on judicial power, \"[t]he\ncontrolling question is whether the function to be exercised by the court is a judicial\nfunction.\"  Fed. Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Bros., Co., 289 U.S. 266, 277 (1933).  An\n30\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 34\nArticle III court determining a Fourth Amendment suppression motion on a federal\nindictment surely performs a \"judicial function.\"\nThe first defect in FISA under Article III is that it permits the courts to act when\nthere is no case or controversy.  Camreta v. Green, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 2028 (2011)\n(\"Article III of the Constitution grants this Court authority to  adjudicate legal disputes\nonly in  the context of \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\").  The role of the courts is to\nresolve disputes between or among parties.  Principal Life Ins. Co. v. Robinson, 394\nF.3d 665, 671 (9th Cir. 2005).  They may not issue advisory opinions.  Sierra Club v.\nMorton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 n.3 (1972).  Contrary to these principles, FISA permits the\ncourts to act in a one-sided manner, treating the question of suppression as if only one\nparty had an interest sufficient to warrant judicial action.\nThe second defect in FISA is that it limits the Judiciary's Article III powers by\nrequiring the courts to defer to executive assertions in a criminal case.  50  U.S.C.\n§§ 1805(a)(4),1824(a)(4).  The fact that FISA gives the Attorney General undue control\nof the warrant and suppression motion processes and limits FISA review infringes on\nthe judicial responsibility to say what the law is, as it \"is a responsibility of this Court as\nultimate interpreter of the Constitution.\"  Baker v. Carr, 396 U.S. 186, at 211 (1962). \nSee Kendall v. United States, 37 U.S. 524, at 526 (1838) (discerning judicial authority\nand separation of powers).\nThe third defect is that FISA, as implemented ex parte and in camera, violates\nthe separation of powers inherent in the first three Articles of the Constitution.  While\nthe Executive Branch must assure that the laws are faithfully executed, the Judiciary\n31\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 34\nultimately must decide whether the executive action complies with legislative standards.\nBy conferring deference to the Executive while excluding the citizen, the separation of\npowers is breached, with the citizen ineffectively protected from executive overreaching.\nThe judicial power to conduct a Fourth Amendment suppression hearing flows\ndirectly from Article III of the Constitution.  It does not flow from, nor can it be limited by,\na purported congressional delegation to the Attorney General, who in turn tells this\nCourt how to exercise its judicial powers and discretion in a bona fide constitutional\n\"case and controversy.\"\nV. CONCLUSION\nFirst, even without FISA disclosure it is apparent that the FISA investigation in\nthis case did not meet statutory standards.  The purpose of this FISA investigation was\nto conduct a criminal investigation and there was no connection, much less the\n\"significant\" connection required, to foreign intelligence gathering.  Furthermore, there\nwas no probable cause to find that Mr. Muhtorov was an \"agent of a foreign power\" as\nrequired by FISA.  Second, is that disclosure of the FISA evidence is required in this\ncase both because defense input is necessary to properly address the complex matters\nat issue in the motion to suppress, and because disclosure is required under due \n32\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 125   Filed 05/25/12   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 34\nprocess principles.  Finally, FISA is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied in\nthis case because it violates the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, as well as Article\nIII to the United States Constitution.\nRespectfully submitted,\nRAYMOND P.

BAKHTIYOR JUMAEV,  )  OF PRIVILEGE \n) \nDefendants.  ) \nDECLARATION AND CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE \nOF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES \nI, Eric H. Holder, Jr., hereby declare the following: \n1.  I am the Attorney General of the United States of America and head of the Ynited \nStates Department of Justice, an Executive Department of the United States.  I have official \ncustody of and control over the files and records of the United States Department of Justice. \nThe matters stated herein are based on my knowledge, on consideration of information available \nto me in my official capacity as Attorney General, on discussions that I have had with other \nJustice Department officials, and on conclusions I have reached after my review of this \ninformation. \n2.  Under the authority of 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1881 e(a), I submit this declaration \npursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (\"FISA\"), as amended, in \nconnection with the above-captioned criminal proceeding.  I have been advised that the \nGovernment presently intends to use in the above-identified criminal proceeding information \nobtained or derived from the targeting of non-U.S. persons outside the United States conducted \npursuant to FISA.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c) and 1881e(a).  Accordingly, Defendants Jamshid \n1 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559-1   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 3\nMuhtorov and Bakhtiyor Jumaev, by and through their attorneys, have filed a motion seeking \ndisclosure and suppression ofFISA-related materials (hereinafter the \"Defendants' Motion\"). \nThe Government will file an opposition to the Defendants' Motion.  For the reasons set forth in \nthe Government's Opposition, it is necessary to provide this Court with the certification(s), \naffidavits, procedures, and materials submitted to, and the opinions and orders issued by, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\"), as well as other related documents (hereinafter \ncollectively referred to as ''the FISA Materials\"). \n3.  Based on the facts and considerations set forth below, I hereby claim that it would \nharm the national security of the United States to disclose or hold an adversarial hearing with \nrespect to the FISA Materials.  The United States will submit the relevant classified documents \nto this Court as part of a \"Sealed Appendix,\" so this Court may conduct an in camera, \nex parte review of the legality of the FISA collection at issue.  My Claim of Privilege also \nextends to the classified portions of any memoranda and briefs the Government may file in \nconnection with this litigation and to any oral representations that may be made by the \nGovernment that reference the classified information contained in the FISA Materials. \n4.  In support of my Claim of Privilege, the United States is submitting to the Court for \nin camera, ex parte review the Declaration of Stephanie O'Sullivan, Acting Director ofNational \nIntelligence.  The Declaration of Ms. O'Sullivan sets forth, in detail, the specific facts on which \nmy Claim of Privilege is based.  The Declaration of Ms. 0' Sullivan is classified at the \"TOP \nSECRET\" level. \n5.  Relying on the facts set forth in the Declaration of Ms. O'Sullivan, I certify that the \nunauthorized disclosure of the FISA Materials that are classified at the \"TOP SECRET\" level \ncould reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 559-1   Filed 05/09/14   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 3\nUnited States.  I further certify that the unauthorized disclosure of the FISA materials that are \nclassified at the \"SECRET\" level reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the \nnational security of the United States.  The FISA Materials contain sensitive and classified \ninformation concerning United States intelligence sources and methods and other information \nrelated to efforts of the United States to conduct counterterrorism investigations, including the \nmanner and means by which those investigations are conducted.  As a result, the unauthorized \ndisclosure of the information could harm the national security interests of the United States. \n6.  I respectfully request that the Court treat the contents of the Sealed Appendix, for \nsecurity purposes, in the same sensitive manner that the contents were treated in the submission \nto this Court, and to return the Sealed Appendix to the Department of Justice upon the \ndisposition of the Defendants' Motion.  The Department of Justice will retain the Sealed \nAppendix under the seal of the Court subject to any further orders of this Court or other courts of \ncompetent jurisdiction. \nPursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section 17  46, I declare under penalty of perjury \nthat the foregoing is true and correct.

INTRODUCTION \nMore than a year ago, evidence of the United States government’s mass \nsurveillance program first began appearing in the Guardian newspaper.  The \nsource of the Guardian’s information was NSA contractor Edward Snowden. In \nsome circles, Mr. Snowden has been vilified. In others, he has been praised. \nSince early July 2013 to the present, hundreds of articles from the Guardian and \nother  worldwide  publications,  including  the  Washington  Post  and  New  York \n1\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 25\nTimes,  have  revealed  the  existence  of  a  government  operation  aimed  at \ncollecting,  storing,  reviewing,  and  using  the  personal  and  political \ncommunications of millions of American people and millions of people abroad.1  \nA global maelstrom has erupted as a result.  \nPlaintiffs in the case of Clapper v. Amnesty International, ___ U.S.___, \n133 S. Ct. 1138, 185 L.Ed2d 264 (2013) challenged one of the statutes upon \nwhich the U.S. government has relied in its implementation of this secret mass \nsurveillance program, namely, the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 (“the FAA”). \nDuring oral argument before the United States Supreme Court on October 29, \n2012,  upon  being  asked  who  has  standing  under  the  statute  to  make  a \nconstitutional  challenge  to  the  interceptions,  the  Solicitor  General,  Donald  B. \nVerrilli, Jr. responded: “The first is if an aggrieved person, someone who is a \nparty to a communication, gets notice that the government intends to introduce \ninformation  in  a  proceeding  against  him.”    See  transcript  of  oral  argument, \navailable  at  www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument.../11-1025.pdf  at \n3-4; see also Exhibit H, attached to Mr. Jumaev’s Motion for Notice of Whether \nthe  Government  Intends  to  Use  Evidence  Obtained  under  or  Derived    from  \nSurveillance Authorized by the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 (“FAA”) (Doc. 458). \nOops!  Could it be possible that people working down the hall from the Solicitor \nGeneral had not even informed him of what the government’s inner sanctum was \ndoing since, unbeknownst to Mr. Verrilli, his colleagues in the National Security \n                                                             \n1 Ordinary Internet users, Americans and non-Americans alike, far outnumber \nlegally targeted foreigners in the communications intercepted by the National \nSecurity  Agency  from  U.S.  digital  networks,  according  to  a  four-month \ninvestigation by the Washington Post reported on July 5, 2014 in an article, \n\t\r  \n2\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 25\nDivision had determined that notice was not required under the FAA! It took the \ngovernment nearly a year from the oral argument in Clapper, supra, to provide \nthe first defendant in a criminal proceeding with the notice that their advocate \nbefore the Supreme Court said was required. \nDid  a  “gotcha”  before  the  Supreme  Court  result  in  the  United  States \nhaving to finally accord an accused the constitutional right of due process and \nwhatever  attendant  rights  flowed  from  it?    After  all,  the  executive  branch \ndisclosed this information to one of the FAA’s champions in the United States \nSenate, Senator Diane Feinstein, to enable her in December 2012 to argue the \nefficacy of the FAA as part of her persuasion to extend the FAA another five \nyears. See Doc. 458 at 3-4 and Exhibit E attached thereto. This combination of \nevents led the United States on October 25, 2013, for the first time since the \nFAA’s enactment in 2008, to inform a criminal accused that information obtained \nor derived from a FAA collection would be used against him.  That notice to the \nco-defendant Jamshid Muhtorov in this case has spawned the presentation of the \nmyriad pleadings that now await this Court’s determination. This Reply by Mr. \nJumaev may be the culmination of that process.2 \nIt would be presumptuous of Mr. Jumaev in this Reply to try to fashion a \nmore articulate, better reasoned, or more thorough answer to the Government’s \nResponse of issues common to both defendants than what has been presented \nby Mr. Muhtorov in Doc. 602.  As a result, Mr. Jumaev will invoke the court’s local \nrule that will allow him to adopt that pleading.  Mr. Jumaev will, however, address \n                                                             \n2 The Procedural History from the First FISA Notice to Mr. Muhtorov (Doc. 12) \nfiled on (date, 2012) to his Reply to the Government’s Response (Doc. 602) filed \non July 2, 2014 is described in the attached Appendix A.  \n3\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 25\nthe issues that are unique to him, namely: (1) whether he has standing to raise a \nmotion to suppress, including the issue of “evidence derived from;” (2) whether \nhe  has  standing  to  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  the  FAA;  and  (3)  the \nconstitutional implications of the FAA.   \nII. ADOPTION OF MR. MUHTOROV’S MOTION \nMr.  Jumaev,  pursuant  to  D.C.Colo.LCr  12.1(b),  respectfully  approves, \nadopts,  and  incorporates  by  reference  any  or  all  of  the  reasons  stated, \narguments advanced, and/or authorities cited by the Mr. Muhtorov’s “Reply to \nGovernment’s Response (Doc. 559, 569)” (Doc. 602). \nIII. THE GOVERNMENT IS INCORRECT IN ASSERTING THAT MR. JUMAEV \nLACKS STANDING AND THAT HIS MOTION TO SUPPRESS SHOULD BE \nSUMMARILY DENIED \n \nThe  Government  Response,  while  97  pages  long,  contains  wholesale \nredactions  –  indeed,  entire  headings,  sections,  and  presumably  lengthy \nsegments of text – in an attempt to render it largely bullet proof. The armor, \nhowever, has its soft spots. \nMr.  Jumaev  has  repeatedly  requested  the  government  to  answer  two \nbasic questions:  (1) whether the electronic surveillance described in its FISA \nNotice was conducted pursuant to the pre-2008 provisions of FISA, or instead, \nthe FAA; and (2) whether the affidavit and other evidence offered in support of \nany FISA order relied on information obtained under or derived from an FAA \nsurveillance order? Jumaev Motion for Notice (Doc. 458), at 21; Reply in Support \nof Jumaev Motion for Notice (Doc. 501), at 19-20. \n4\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 25\nThe  government  has  refused  to  directly  answer  either  question,  but \ninstead has relied on its election not to provide Mr. Jumaev with a Second FISA \nNotice similar to what was served upon Mr. Muhtorov, stating that Mr. Jumaev \nwould have received such notice if he had satisfied the statutory criteria for \nnotice. See Doc. 470 at 4 and Doc. 525 at 2-3. The Government Response (Doc. \n559) at 16, parrots its prior explanations by stating:  \nIn its response and surreply to Jumaev’s motion, the government \nstated  that  it  does  not  intend  to  introduce  or  otherwise  use  or \ndisclose against Jumaev in any trial, hearing or other proceeding in \nthis case evidence obtained or derived from Section 702 acquisition \nto which Jumaev is an aggrieved person.  Thus, Jumaev is not \nentitled to any additional notice under FISA. \n \nA. The Test For Standing Proposed by the Government is Formulated \nfrom FISA and Inapplicable To Defendants’ Challenge to the Legality \nOf The FAA and Evidence Derived Therefrom \n \nIn essence, the government claims that Mr. Jumaev’s challenge to the \nconstitutionality of FAA should be denied for the same reason it claims he is not \nentitled to a direct response to his request for notice, namely, he lacks standing.  \nThe government reaches this conclusion in the mistaken belief that there is a \nfive-part test determinative of whether Mr. Jumaev is entitled to notice under the \nFAA, thereby affording him standing to challenge the constitutionality of the FAA. \nAccording to the government, its notice obligation only arises when:  \nThe government (1) “intends to enter into evidence or otherwise \nuse or disclose” (2) “against any aggrieved person” (3) in a “trial, \nhearing or other proceeding in or before any court, department, \nofficer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United \nStates”;  (4)  any  “information  obtained  or  derived  from”  (5)  an \n“electronic  surveillance  [or  physical  search]  of  that  aggrieved \nperson.” 50 U.S.C. §1806(d); see 50 U.S.C. § 1825(d); see also 50 \nU.S.C. § 1881e(a). \n \n5\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 25\nGovernment Response (Doc. 559), at 33 (bracketed material original). Further \ncompounding the government’s opaque response is its failure to explain how Mr. \nJumaev has not met any of these five elements. The government, in essence, \nhas said that Mr. Jumaev has not met at least one of these five elements, yet it \nrefuses to directly state which element or elements have not been met.3 \nMr. Jumaev has not found, and the government has not cited, any judicial \nauthority for the position that the government’s five-part test is the applicable \nstandard  for  entitlement  to  notice  under  the  FAA  or  is  the  prerequisite  for \nchallenging the constitutionality of FAA. Rather, the government’s position for \nstanding appears rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding between the original \nFISA provisions and its amendments in 2008 as the FAA and, in particular, the \nmistaken belief that the full FISA criteria for notice have to be met in order to \n                                                             \n3 Not only has the government refused to answer these simple two questions, it \nhas gone even further in stonewalling Mr. Jumaev’s efforts to discover relevant \ninformation to enable him to challenge the introduction of anticipated evidence \nagainst him.  At p. 14 of its Response, the government has redacted the entire \nsection under the heading “1. The FBI’s Investigation of the Defendants.”  This \nredaction is inappropriate because both defendants have been provided with \nthousands of pages of discovery regarding the government’s investigation of \neach of them.  Furthermore, it is inconceivable that the two simple questions \nreferenced above, along with the more fundamental question -- was Mr. Jumaev \nsubject  to  electronic  surveillance  under  the  FAA?  --  could  not  have  been \naddressed in the discussion of the FBI investigation in a manner that did not \ncompromise national security but still provided basic, necessary information to \nthe defense.  This issue was more fully addressed in Mr. Jumaev’s “Motion to \nRequire the Government to Disclose, or Otherwise Provide Him Access to, its \nClassified  Pleadings  (Doc.  569)  and  Objection  to  the  Ex  Parte,  In  Camera \nSubmission  to  and  Final  Determination  by  the  Court  of  Such  Pleadings  and \nRelated  Documents  Without  Disclosure  and  Attendant  Proceedings  First \nAfforded to Defendant” (Doc. 590) at 7-9; the Court is requested to take judicial \nnotice of that discussion. \n\t\r  \n6\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 25\ntrigger  any  notice  requirement  under  the  FAA  or  standing  to  mount  a \nconstitutional challenge to the FAA. \nAlthough the differences between FISA and the FAA have been explained \nin Mr. Jumaev’s Reply (Doc. 499) at 21-23, a summary of that discussion bears \nrecitation here. The second element of the government’s five-part test, i.e., that \nMr. Jumaev must be an “aggrieved person” to be entitled to notice under the FAA \nor challenge its constitutionality, is inapplicable to a FAA notice.   The term \n“aggrieved person” is a FISA concept that predated the enactment the FAA.  \nFISA defines “aggrieved person” at two locations within the statute: 50 U.S.C. \n1801(k) states: “‘Aggrieved person’ means a person who is the target of an \nelectronic surveillance or any other person whose communications or activities \nwere subject to electronic surveillance”; 50 U.S.C. § 1821(2) states: “‘Aggrieved \nperson’ means a person whose premises, property, information, or material is the \ntarget  of  physical  search  or  any  other  person  whose  premises,  property, \ninformation, or material was subject to physical search.”  \nThe FAA, enacted in 2008, on the other hand, contains no definition of \n“aggrieved  person.”  The  FAA’s  definitional  section,  50  U.S.C.  §  1881(a), \nspecifically prescribes that nine words or phrases have the same definition under \nthe FAA as in section 1801 of FISA; “aggrieved person” is not one of those \nphrases.4  50 U.S.C. § 1881(b) provides definitions for five additional terms; \n                                                             \n4 50 U.S.C.  §1881(a) states: “The terms “agent of a foreign power”, “Attorney \nGeneral”, “contents”, “electronic surveillance”, “foreign intelligence information”, \n“foreign power”, “person”, “United States”, and “United States person” have the \nmeanings  given  such  terms  in  section  101  [50  USCS  §  1801],  except  as \nspecifically provided in this title [50 USCS §§ 1881 et seq.]. \n\t\r  \n7\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 25\n“aggrieved  person”  is  not  one  of  them.5  If  Congress  wanted  the  concept  of \n“aggrieved person” to have the same meaning in the FAA as it does in the \noriginal FISA, it would have said so. \nIt is no wonder that the FAA nowhere defines “aggrieved person,” for while \nFISA  includes  requirements  of  individualized  suspicion  and  particularity  in \nidentifying  targets  (50  U.S.C.  §1805(c)),  the  FAA  contains  none  of  these \nrequirements and facilitates the issuance of blanket authorizations for conducting \nelectronic surveillance (50 U.S.C. §1881a(d)(1)(g)(4)). Under FISA, 50 U.S.C. § \n1805(a)(2)(A), the FISC is required to find probable cause both that surveillance \ntarget is “foreign power” or agent thereof and that facilities to be monitored were \nbeing used or about to be used by foreign power or its agent; whereas under the \nFAA,  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(i)(3)(A),  the  FISC  no  longer  needs  to  make  any \nprobable cause determination.  Id.  The government seeks to blend FISA and \nFAA together and to piggyback the requirement of FAA notice onto FISA’s notice \nprovisions contained in 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c) and 1825(d).    \nConsequently,  because  it  is  nowhere  defined  under  the  FAA,  it  is \nimpossible to be an “aggrieved person” with respect to FAA surveillance. The \ngovernment thus has crafted a five-part test that includes an element that it is \nimpossible for anyone to meet. This exemplifies why the government’s five-part \ntest  for  standing  for  notice  under  the  FAA  and  opportunity  to  challenge  the \nconstitutionality of the FAA is without merit.  \n                                                             \n5  The  additional  terms  defined  at  50  U.S.C.  §  1881(b)  are:  “congressional \nintelligence  committees,”  “Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court”/”Court,” \n“Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review”/”Court of Review,” “electronic \ncommunication service provider,” and “intelligence committee.”\t\r  \n8\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 25\nB. The Government Should Not Be the Sole Arbiter of What “Derived \nfrom” Means under the FAA \n \nIn the face of Mr. Jumeav’s concerns as to whether evidence “derived \nfrom” FAA surveillance will be used against him, the government asks the Court \nand Mr. Jumeav to rely on the government’s judgment as to when and if “derived \nfrom evidence” will be utilized. The government refuses to even state whether \nevidence derived from FAA surveillance was later utilized in obtaining warrants \nfor FISA surveillance. \n On the one hand, the government attempts to assuage the Court and \ncounsel that FAA  “derived from” evidence will not be used against Mr. Jumeav. \nOn the other, the government has made the opposite representation at least \nthree times now in this case. First, in the “Discovery Conference Memorandum \nand Order” (Doc. 89), p. 5, § E, ¶ 3, the govement states that in this case there \nhave been leads obtained by electronic surveillance of the defendant’s person or \npremises.  Second,  the  “Declaration  and  Claim  of  Privilege  of  the  Attorney \nGeneral of the United States,” executed by Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. \nand attached to the Government’s Response states in ¶ 2 that: “I have been \nadvised that the Government presently intends to use in the above-identified \ncriminal proceeding information obtained or derived from the targeting of non-US \npersons  outside  the  United  States  conducted  pursuant  to  FISA.”  Third,  the \nGovernment Response at 8 concedes that FAA “derived from” evidence has \nalready  been  used  in  this  case,  as  the  government  discloses  “that  the \ngovernment  has  offered  into  evidence  or  otherwise  used  or  disclosed  in \nproceedings,  including  at  trial,  in  this  case  information  derived  from  the \n9\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 25\nacquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 [FISA], as amended, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.” \n[bracketed material in original; internal quotations omitted]. \nThe meaning of “derived from” is well established in constitutional law \nregarding surveillance.  Evidence is “derived” from illegal surveillance when it is \nthe “product” of that surveillance or “is otherwise acquired as an indirect result of \nthe unlawful search, up to the point at which the connection with the unlawful \nsearch  becomes  ‘so  attenuated  as  to  dissipate  the  taint.’”  Murray  v.  United \nStates, 487 U.S. 533, 536-37 (1988) (quoting Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. \n338, 341(1939)). “Derived” evidence is a “well established term of art” and carries \ncontext,  carrying  a  meaning  that  pre-dates  and  was  incorporated  into  FISA. \nChandler v. U.S. Army, 125 F.3d 1296, 1304 (9th Cir. 1997); see also United \nStates v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 531-32 (1974) (interpreting the meaning of \nderived evidence in relation to a sequence of electronic intercepts and wiretap \norders). \nNevertheless,  and  despite  the  FAA’s  enactment  six  years  ago,  the \ngovernment has been unable to settle on a consistent definition of what “derived \nfrom” means as used in that statute. Although the criminal Complaint was lodged \nagainst Mr. Muhtorov in January 2012, the government did not provide him with \nnotice that it intended to use FAA acquired evidence against him until October \n25,  2013.  The  government  attempts  to  mitigate  this  noncompliance  with  the \nexplanation in the Government Response, at 9 n.2, that its decision to give notice \nwas a result of recent consideration of “the particular question of whether and \n10\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 25\nunder  what  circumstances  information  obtained  through  an  electronic \nsurveillance  under  Title  I  or  physical  search  under  Title  III  could  also  be \nconsidered to have derived from prior collection under Title VII.” One wonders if \nthe Solicitor General’s embarrassment before the Supreme Court in Clapper, \nsupra,  had  anything  to  do  with  the  government’s  “recent  consideration.” \nEffectively the government has conceded that it now ascribes a different meaning \nto the term “derived from” than it did two years ago.  In doing so, the government \nfurther concedes that its earlier interpretation of “derived from” was incomplete \nand incorrect. \nEven more inexplicable is the government’s grossly belated notice in the \nrecent case of United States v. Mohamud, No. 3:10-CR-00475-KI-1, 2014 WL \n2866749, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85452 (D. Or. June 24, 2014).  There, the \ndefendant was convicted in January 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass \ndestruction.  It  was  not  until  November  19,  2013  --  11  months  after  the \ndefendant’s conviction -- that the government provided notice that FAA-acquired \nevidence had been used during the trial to obtain the defendant’s conviction. \nNeither this Court nor Mr. Jumaev should have to rely upon the government’s \never morphing interpretation of what evidence is “derived from” FAA surveillance.  \nThe government’s apparent position that it intends to use FAA-acquired \nevidence  against  Mr.  Muhtorov,  but  not  against  Mr.  Jumaev,  is  a  legal \nimpossibility.  The  government  ignores  that  Count  1  of  the  Superseding \nIndictment  charges  both  Messrs.  Muhtorov  and  Jumaev  with  conspiracy. \nConsequently, any statement by either defendant determined to have been made \n11\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 25\nduring  the  course  and  scope  of  the  conspiracy  generally  will  be  admissible \nagainst the codefendant.  See Fed. R. Evid. 810(d)(2)(E).  Additionally, under the \nPinkerton doctrine of co-conspirator liability, a conspirator generally is liable for \nthe  substantive  offenses  committed  by  a  co-conspirator  when  they  are \nreasonably foreseeable and committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See \nPinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946); United States v. Cherry, 217 \nF.3d 811, 817 (10th Cir. 2000) (explaining and applying Pinkerton). Thus, it is a \nlegal and factual impossibility for FAA-acquired evidence to be utilized at trial \nagainst Mr. Muhtorov and not Mr. Jumaev.  As a result, Mr. Jumaev would be \nharmed by the introduction of FAA-acquired evidence in this case, and therefore \nhe certainly has standing to receive notice and to challenge the constitutionality \nof the FAA. \nMr. Jumaev has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the FAA \nbecause there is a “realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the \nstatute's operation.”  Pennell v. San Jose, 485 U.S. 1, 8 (1988); see also Davis v. \nFederal  Election  Comm’n,  554  U.S.  724,  734-735  (2008)  (self-financed \ncongressional  candidate  challenged  the  constitutionality  of  election  law  that \nrelaxed the limits on an opponent's contributions when self-financed candidate’s \nspending itself exceeded certain limits, where opponent had decided not taken \nadvantage  of  allowable  increased  statutory  contribution  limits,  plaintiff  had \nstanding due to “realistic and impending threat” opponent would do so); Duke \nPower Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, (1978) \n(plaintiffs  who  lived  near  proposed  nuclear  power  plant  challenged \n12\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 25\nconstitutionality of statute that limited the plant's liability for nuclear accident; \nCourt found standing due to generalized concern about exposure to radiation”). \nIV.  INDEPENDENT  PANEL  REVIEWS  EMPHASIZE  THE  RIGHT  TO \nPRIVACY AND QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE FAA \n \nMany of the constitutional arguments raised by Messrs. Muhtorov and \nJumaev (Docs. 520, 521, and 602) have also been addressed and countenanced \nin many respects by two independent panels: one commissioned specifically by \nthe  President,  and  the  other  by  the  executive  branch’s  advisory  board \nestablished by Congress in 2004. They are cited infra, and relevant excerpts \nfrom each to this case are now discussed.   \n A. The FAA Violates The Fourth Amendment \n \n “The right to privacy is essential to a free and self-governing society.  The \nrise of modern technologies makes it all the more important that democratic \nnations respect people’s fundamental right to privacy, which is a defining part of \nindividual  security  and  personal  liberty.”    The  President’s  Review  Group  on \nIntelligence  and  Communications  Technologies,  Liberty  and  Security  in  a \nChanging World, December 12, 2013, at 12 (the “President’s Review”). \nExcessive surveillance and unjustified secrecy can threaten civil liberties, \npublic trust, and the core processes of democratic self-government. All parts of \nthe  government,  including  those  that  protect  our  national  security,  must  be \nsubject to the rule of law.”  Id. \nWhile it is the government’s responsibility to protect this country’s national \nsecurity, the government is equally responsible for protecting the fundamental \nvalues of our homeland security as captured in the Fourth Amendment:  “The \n13\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 25\nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...” (emphasis \nadded). Id. at 15. The underlying goal is to achieve the right “balance” between \nthe two forms of security. Id. at 16.  \nTo achieve this balance, the President’s Review endorsed new steps to \nprotect those within the United States engaged in communications with non-US \npersons, including restrictions on the ability of the FISC to compel third parties \n(such as telephone providers) to disclose private information to the government, \nand restrictions on the issuance of National Security Letters (by which the FBI \nnow compels individuals and organizations to turn over certain otherwise private \nrecords), recommending prior judicial review except in emergencies where time \nis of the essence.  Id. at 18. \nThe  President’s  Review  recommended  that  if  the  government  legally \nintercepts a Section 702 communication directed at a non-US person who is \nlocated outside the US, and if the communication either includes a US person as \na participant or reveals information about a US person: (1) any information about \nthe US person should be purged upon detection unless it either has foreign \nintelligence value or is necessary to prevent serious harm to others; (2) any \ninformation about the US person may not be used in evidence in any proceeding \nagainst that US person; and (3) the government may not search the contents of \nSection  702  communications  in  an  effort  to  identify  communications  of  a \nparticular US person, except (a) when the information is necessary to prevent a \nthreat of death or serious bodily harm, or (b) when the government obtains a \n14\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 25\nwarrant based on probable cause to believe the US person is planning or is \nengaged in acts of international terrorism. Id. at 28-29 (“Recommendation 12”). \nAlthough the President’s Review did acknowledge that Section 702 “does \nplay an important role in the nation’s efforts to prevent terrorist attacks across the \nglobe,” (Doc. 559 at 57), the question remains whether it achieves that goal in a \nway  that  unnecessarily  sacrifices  individual  privacy  and  damages  foreign \nrelations. Id. at 145.  The President’s Review concluded that Section 702 has a \npotentially troubling impact on the privacy of US persons because of the risk of \ninadvertent interception. Id. As a result, the panel made Recommendation 12 for \nreasons that included the following:   \nThe government cannot lawfully target communications of a US person \nwhether the individual is in or outside the US, without satisfying probable cause \nof both FISA and 4th Amendment. However, under the FAA, targeting of a non-\nUS person located outside the United States requires only that the government \nreasonably  believe  that  the  target  is  such  a  person.  Thus,  US  persons  are \nappreciably more likely to have their constitutionally protected communications \ninadvertently intercepted under this lower standard whenever the government \nengages in Section 702 surveillance.  President’s Review, at 147. \nIn standard practice involving Title III, 18 U.S.C. § 2510, et seq., if the \ngovernment  wiretaps  an  individual’s  phone  because  he  is  suspected  of,  for \nexample, drug trafficking, and during that tap a completely innocent persons is \noverheard  talking  on  that  phone  about  non-related  criminal  activity,  the \ngovernment customarily will discontinue listening to and even discontinue the \n15\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 25\ninterception of the call to implement necessity protocols, thus effectively purging \nthe call from its collection.  However, that standard practice occurs under the \nrigors of  probable  cause,  necessity,  and  individualized  targeting  for  the \napplication’s initial approval and under stringent minimization and a limited time \nperiod for the collection of the interceptions.  None of the foregoing rigors apply \nto Section 702 collection, which because of its lower standard of “reasonably \nbelieved”  increases  the  likelihood  that  the  innocent  person’s  communications \nwith  a  foreign-friend,  physician,  or  attorney  abroad  would  be  inadvertently \nintercepted.  Indeed,  the  “NSA  treats  all  content  intercepted  incidentally  from \nthird  parties  as  permissible  to  retain,  store,  search,  and  distribute  to  its \ngovernment customers.” Washington Post, at 4.  In fact, “the NSA does not \ngenerally attempt to remove irrelevant personal content, because it is difficult for \none analyst to know what might become relevant to another.”  Id. \n Second,  it is  often  difficult to determine  whether  an  e-mail  address, \ninternet  communication,  Skype  address, or  telephone  number  of  the  non-\ntargeted participant in a legally acquired Section 702 communication belongs to a \nUS person. In such circumstances, there is a significant risk that Section 702 \ncommunications  involving  US  persons  will  be  retained  indefinitely  in  a \ngovernment database.  Id. at 149.  Third, the concept of information of “foreign \nintelligence value” has a degree of vagueness and can lead to the preservation \nof private information about US persons whose communications are incidentally \nintercepted under a Section 702 collection.  Id.  \n16\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 25\nFor  the  above  reasons,  there  is  a  risk  that  the  government  after  it \nincidentally collects information about US persons during the course of a Section \n702 collection will be able to later search its database of communications in a \nway that invades the legitimate privacy interests of persons in the United States. \nThe underlying rationale of Section 702 is to protect the privacy interests of US \npersons  even  when  they  communicate  with  non-US  persons  abroad.   They \nshould  not  lose  that  protection  merely  because  the  government  has  legally \ntargeted  non-US  persons  abroad  under  a  legal  standard  that  could  not  be \nemployed to target a US person who participates in that communication. Id. at \n150.   \nThe President Review’s Recommendation 12 would allow the government \nto target non-US persons abroad while at the same time preserving the privacy \nand  security  interests  of  the  US  person  and  reduce  the  incentive  of  the \ngovernment  to  use  Section  702  in  an  effort  to  gather  evidence  against  US \npersons in a way that would circumvent the underlying values of both FISA and \nthe 4th Amendment. Id.  \nA second review panel, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board \n(“PCLOB”), recently issued its Report on the Surveillance Program Operated \nPursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“PCLOB \nReport”).  The Panel noted that  “evaluating the constitutionality of the Section \n702 program poses unique challenges” since it is “complex surveillance program \n–  one  that  entails  many  separate  decisions  to  monitor  large  numbers  of \nindividuals,  resulting  in  the  annual  collection  of  hundreds  of  millions  of \n17\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 25\ncommunications  of  different  types,  obtained  through  a  variety  of  methods, \npursuant  to  multiple  foreign  intelligence  imperatives,  and  involving  four \nintelligence agencies that each have their own rules governing how they may \nhandle and use the communications that are acquired.”  PCLOP Report, July 2, \n2014, 86.   \n  The PCLOP Report acknowledged that “the relevant Fourth Amendment \ninterests are those of U.S. persons whose communications may be acquired \ndespite not themselves having being targeted for surveillance.”  Id. at 87. The \nacquisitions can occur in four main situations:  \n(1)  An  “incidental”  collection  –  when  a  U.S.  person  communicates  by \ntelephone or Internet with a targeted non-U.S. person located abroad; \n(2)  An “about” collection – when a U.S. person sends or receives an \nInternet  communication  that  is  routed  internationally  and  which \ncommunication  makes  reference  to  a  targeted  email  address;  here \nneither the sender nor recipient of the communication is a targeted \nnon-U.S. person;  \n(3) A “multiple-communications transaction” – when a U.S. person sends \nor receives an Internet communication that is embedded within the \nsame  “transaction”  as  a  different  communication  that  meets  the \nrequirements for acquisition;  \n(4) An “inadvertent” collection – when a U.S. person’s communications are \nacquired by mistake due to a targeting error, an implementation error, \nor a technological malfunction.  \n18\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 25\nId.  Any Fourth Amendment assessment of the Section 702 program must take \ninto account the cumulative privacy intrusions and risks of all four categories \nabove, together with the limits and protections built into the program that mitigate \nthem. Id. \nHere, it has been shown that Mr. Jumaev has communicated with persons \noverseas. See Doc. 499 at 15. He and Mr. Muhtorov have engaged in Internet \ncommunications wherein the foreign email address of sodiqlar.com, an IJU site, \nwas mentioned.  Id. at 16. The facilitator of sodiqlar.com is most likely a non-U.S. \nperson targeted under Section 702.  Id. at 17-18.  Internet communications of Mr. \nJumaev  most  likely  fall  within  one  or  more  of  the  above  categories.    The \ngovernment refuses to state whether that is so, other than to obliquely note that \neven  if  one’s  communications  were  acquired  under  Section  702,  but  the \ngovernment does not intend to use them in any proceeding against the U.S. \nperson,  then  that  person  is  not  entitled  to  be  informed  whether  such \ncommunications  were  indeed  acquired.  It  is  not  within  the  government’s \nexclusive domain to decide if information is “derived from” such a collection, if the \ninformation is relevant to any of Mr. Jumaev’s defenses, or if the information is \nfavorable to Mr. Jumaev under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its \nprogeny.  \n \n \nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION \n \nThe government’s refusal to answer two basic questions with a simple \n“yes” or “no” has unduly hampered Mr. Jumaev’s efforts at a full and meaningful \n19\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 25\nchallenge to the FAA evidence that the government has stated will be introduced \nin this criminal proceeding. \nMr. Jumaev has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the FAA \nbecause he will be harmed by the introduction of FAA acquired information or \nevidence derived therefrom in the criminal proceedings against him. \nMr. Jumaev has standing to seek suppression of the information obtained \nor  derived  from  the  FAA  collection  because  he  was  likely  intercepted  or \noverheard during such surveillance and/or his activities were the subject of such \nsurveillance. \nEvidence uncovered over the course of more than a year’s investigation of \nthe true workings of the government’s use of the FAA has questioned the notion \nof  incidental  and  inadvertent  collection  of  information  and  more  and  more \nappears as if specific individuals may have been targeted in order to avoid the \nmore stringent collection, preservation, and use standards under FISA. \n   Based upon the reasons discussed herein, Mr. Jumaev seeks discovery \nof the materials described in Defendants’ Motions to Suppress and suppression \nof  any  information  obtained  or  derived  from  FAA  surveillance,  and  for  such \nfurther relief as the Court may deem appropriate. \n   \n20\t\r    \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 25\nDated this 11th day of July, 2014.            \n       \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \ns/David B.

No.  68)  against  Mr. \nJumaev, informing the Court and Mr. Jumaev that pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ \n1806(c) and 1825(d), the government intends to offer into evidence or otherwise \nuse or disclose in any proceedings in the above-captioned matter, information \nobtained  and  derived  from  electronic  surveillance  and  physical  searches \nconducted  pursuant  to  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  of  1978,  as \namended, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 - 1811, 1821 - 1829. (Doc. 68).  A similar notice \nhad  been  previously  filed  against  codefendant  Jamshid  Muhtorov  (“Mr. \nMuhtorov”) (“Muhtorov First FISA Notice”) (Doc. 12). \nOn  October  25,  2013,  the  government  provided  Mr.  Muhtorov  with  a \nsecond notice that expanded the nature of the foreign intelligence information \nthat it intended to use against this defendant, namely, evidence acquired or \nderived from the FAA. (“Muhtorov Second FISA Notice”) (Doc. 457).   \nOn October 28, 2013, because he had not been afforded a notice similar \nto Doc. 457, Mr. Jumaev filed his “Motion for Notice of Whether the Government \nIntends  to  Use  Evidence  Obtained  Under  or  Derived  from  Surveillance \nAuthorized by the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 (“FAA”)”  (Doc. 458) (“Jumaev \nMotion for Notice”).   \nOn November 19, 2013, the government filed a Response to the Jumaev \nMotion for Notice (Doc. 470).  On January 10, 2014, Mr. Jumaev filed a Reply in \n1\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 25\nsupport  of  the  Motion  for  Notice  (Doc.  501),  and  on  February  4,  2014,  the \ngovernment fled its Sur-Reply on (Doc. 525). Mr. Jumaev’s Motion for Notice \nthen became at-issue.  By then, the round of pleadings, seeking suppression of \nthe FAA acquired evidence had already begun. \nOn January 29, 2014, Mr. Muhtorov, filed a “Motion to Suppress Evidence \nObtained or Derived from Surveillance Under the FISA Amendments Act and \nMotion  for  Discovery”  (Doc.  520).  One  day  later,  Mr.  Jumaev  filed  a  similar \nmotion that both adopted Mr. Muhtorov’s arguments pursuant to D.C.Colo.LCr. \n12.1(b),  and  presented  additional  arguments  germane  to  Mr.  Jumaev.  (Doc. \n521).   \nOn  May  9,  2014,  the  government  filed  a  combined  response  to  both \nsuppression motions, and defense counsel was provided with an “unclassified” \nversion of the response. (Doc. 559). (“Government Response”). The Government \nResponse  also  included  an  appended  “Declaration  and  Claim  of  Privilege” \nexecuted by Attorney General Eric H. Holder.  On May 22, 2014, the government \nfiled  in  camera,  ex  parte,  and  under  seal  its  classified  response  (Doc.  569) \n(“Government’s Classified Response”).  \nThe  Government  Response,  while  97  pages  long,  contains  wholesale \nredactions  –  indeed,  entire  headings,  sections,  and  presumably  lengthy \nsegments  of  text.    Consequently,  on  June  12,  2014,  Mr.  Muhtorov  filed  a \npleading styled, “Defendant Muhtorov’s Motion for Order Requiring Government \nto  Disclose  or  Provide  His  Counsel  Access  to  its  Classified  Pleadings  and \nObjection to Ex Parte Proceedings”. (Doc. 584); on June 18, 2014, Mr. Jumaev \n2\t\r   \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 603   Filed 07/11/14   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 25\nfiled “Motion to Require the Government to Disclose, or Otherwise Provide Him \nAccess to, its Classified Pleadings (Doc. 569) and Objection to the Ex Parte, In \nCamera Submission to and Final Determination by the Court of Such Pleadings \nand  Related  Documents  Without  Disclosure  and  Attendant  Proceedings  First \nAfforded to Defendant” (Doc. 590) (collectively “Motions for Disclosure”).   \nOn  July  2,  2014,  the  government  filed  a  combined  response  to  the \nMotions for Disclosure. (Doc. 600).  The motions for disclosure are now at issue. \nAlso, on July 2, 2014, the Government’s Response was supplemented \nwith the opinion in United States v. Mohamud, No. 3:10-CR-00475-KI-1, 2014 \nWL 2866749, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85452 (D. Or. June 24, 2014). (Doc. 601). \nOn July 3, 2014, Mr. Muhtorov filed “Defendant’s Reply to Government’s \nResponse (Doc. 559, 569)” (Doc. 602) (“Muhtorov’s Reply”).  Mr. Jumaev’s Reply \nfiled today presumably renders the matters of suppression and for discovery at \nissue. \nThus, pending for the Court’s consideration are: Mr. Jumaev’s Motion for \nNotice, the Defendants’ motions for disclosure, and the Defendants’ motions to \nsuppress and for discovery.   \n \n3\t\r   ",

I have\nreviewed the Pretrial Services report and heard the arguments of counsel.\nI find that the evidence establishes that the defendant poses a risk of flight based on the\nfollowing:\nIn order to sustain a motion for detention, the government must establish that there is no\ncondition or combination of conditions which could be imposed in connection with pretrial\nrelease that would reasonably assure (a) the appearance of the defendant as required or (b) the\nsafety of any other person or the community.  18 U.S.C. § 3142(b).  The former element must be\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence, and the latter requires proof by clear and\nconvincing evidence.\nThe Bail Reform Act establishes the following factors to be considered in determining\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of the\ndefendant and the safety of the community:\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 88   Filed 04/12/12   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 3\n(1)   The nature and circumstances of the offense charged,\nincluding whether the offense is a crime of violence or involves a\nnarcotic drug;\n(2)   the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3)   the history and characteristics of the person including–\n(A)   the person’s character, physical and mental\ncondition, family ties, employment, financial\nresources, length of residence in the community,\ncommunity ties, past conduct, history relating to\ndrug and alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record\nconcerning appearance at court proceedings; and\n(B)   whether at the time of the current offense or\narrest, the person was on probation, on parole, or on\nother release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or\ncompletion of sentence for an offense under\nFederal, State, or local law; and\n(4)   the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the\ncommunity that would be posed by the person’s release.\n18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).\nWeighing the factors set out in the Bail Reform Act, I find the following:\nThe defendant has been charged under 18 U.S.C. § 2339B with material support of a\ndesignated foreign terrorist organization and conspiracy and attempt to do the same.\nI find based on the defendant’s history and personal characteristics that no condition or\ncombination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.\nA detainer has been lodged against the defendant by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, and the defendant did not contest detention.\nAfter considering all appropriate factors, I conclude that the preponderance of the\nevidence establishes that no condition or combination of conditions of release will reasonably\n2\n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 88   Filed 04/12/12   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 3\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.\nIT IS ORDERED:\n1. The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his\ndesignated representative for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent\npracticable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal; \n2. The defendant is to be afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult confidentially\nwith defense counsel; and\n3.

This affidavit is intended to set forth probable cause in support of \nthe criminal complaint and search warrants and does not purport to set forth all of the \naffiant's knowledge regarding the investigation. All conversations set forth in this \naffidavit are related in substance and in part. \nBACKGROUND \n4.  The Islamic Jihad Union (\"IJU\", also known as al-Djihad al-Islami, Dzhamaat \nModzhakhedov, and the Islamic Jihad Group of Uzbekistan) is an extremist organization \nthat splintered from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (\"IMU\") in the early 2000s. \nThe IMU was founded by Tohir Yuldashev and Juma Namangani in or around 1998.  The \nIJU is believed to have spilt from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) in late \n2001 shortly after the death ofNamangani.  The IJU adheres to an anti-Western ideology, \nopposes secular rule in Uzbekistan, and seeks to replace the current regime with a \ngovernment based on Islamic law. \n5.  The IJU first conducted attacks in April of2004, targeting a popular bazaar and police at \nseveral roadway checkpoints.  These attacks killed approximately 47 people, including 33 \nterrorists, and some suicide bombers.  The IJU claimed responsibility for these attacks on \nmultiple militant Islamic websites and denounced the leadership of Uzbekistan. \n6.  In July 2004 the IJU conducted simultaneous suicide bombings of the U.s. and Israeli \nEmbassies and the Uzbekistani Prosecutor General's Office in Tashkent.  In claiming \n2 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 21\nresponsibility for these attacks, the IJU stated that their martyrdom operations would \ncontinue.  The IJU also claimed the attacks were committed in support of their \nPalestinian, Iraqi and Afghan brothers in the global insurgency. \n7.  In September 2007, German authorities arrested three IJU operatives, disrupting a plot \nagainst unidentified U.S. or Western facilities in Germany.  The IJU operatives had \nacquired about 700 kg of hydrogen peroxide and an explosives precursor, which was \nenough raw material to make the equivalent of about 1,200 pounds of the explosive, \nTNT.  The IJU claimed responsibility for the foiled plot. \n8.  The IJU has claimed responsibility for attacks targeting Coalition forces in Afghanistan \nin 2008, including a March 2008 suicide attack against a U.S. military post purportedly \ncarried out by a German-born Turk. \n9.  In April 2009, Turkish authorities seized weapons and detained extremists with ties to the \nIJU.  The IJU has also claimed responsibility for a May 2009 attack in Uzbekistan and \nnumerous attacks in Afghanistan against Coalition forces.  It is believed that members of \nboth the IJU and IMU have trained with and provided support to Al Qaida. \n10. The website www.sodiqlar.comis an Uzbek language website that hosts operational \nclaims and statements from the IJU.  The website administrator for www.sodiqlar.comis \nknown by the alias \"Abu Muhammad.\" Public reporting shows that sodiqlar.com is \naffiliated with the IJU and is suspected to be owned and operated by the IJU. \n3 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 21\n11. The Islamic Jihad Union is a designated terrorist organization, designated by the \nSecretary of State, and continuously designated since June 12,2005 (under the name \nIslamic Jihad Group). Notification of its designation appears at 70 F. Reg. 35332-01 \n(June 17,2005), amended to include name \"Islamic Jihad Union\" on April 29, 2008, \npublished in the 73 F. Reg 30443-01 (May 27, 2008). \nFACTS OF THE CASE \nConspiracy to Provide Material Support to the lJU \n12. The FBI has been investigating Jamshid MUHTOROV based on his communications \nwith Islamic Jihad Union (\"IJU\") website administrator and facilitator \"Muhammad.\" \n\"Muhammad\" is known as \"Abu Muhammad.\" \n13. The FBI has also been investigating JUMAEV, a close friend of MUHTOROV. \nJUMAEV provided his mobile telephone number, (267) 597-1321, to the Department of \nHomeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement after being arrested for \nimmigration charges in February 2010.  Upon obtaining appropriate authority, the FBI \nhas lawfully searched and obtained information through various investigative techniques. \nAs a result the FBI has been able to determine that the mobile phone used by JUMAEV is \na T-Mobile mobile phone.  Moreover, there exists incriminating communications \noriginating from JUMAEV's mobile phone, many of which are set forth below.  The FBI \nhas also determined that JUMAEV resides at 3131 Richmond Street, Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, and that he has kept a Sony Vaio laptop computer, model number VGN-\nF8690, service tag of R5170004 at that residence. \n4 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 21\n14.  On or about March 5, 2011, MUHTOROV emailed Abu Muhammad and stated that he \ndelivered Abu Muhammad's hello to JUMAEV.  MUHTOROV stated that JUMAEV \nwas very happy and sent many greetings to Abu Muhammad as well.  MUHTOROV \nstated that JUMAEV promised to send money to Abu Muhammad and the IJU through \nMUHTOROV. \n15. On or about March 6,2011, Abu Muhammad emailed MUHTOROV and instructed him \n[MUHTOROV] to say hello to the brothers again, and asked that Allah accept their \ndeeds.  Abu Muhammad told MUHTOROV that the IJU was in desperate need of money \nat the moment.  Abu Muhammad repeated that the brothers say hello to all of you. \n16. On or about March 8, 2011, MUHTOROV received a phone call from JUMAEV. \nMUHTOROV read JUMAEV parts of a message from the IJU, calling them the \"brothers \nfrom the wedding house.\"  MUHTOROV told JUMAEV that the \"brothers from the \nwedding house are saying hi to you again.\" MUHTOROV told JUMAEV that \"they say \nto you - may Allah accept the associations you made on the way of Allah.\" \nMUHTOROV told JUMAEV that the IJU said they need support.  JUMAEV told \nMUHTOROV that help will go to them and that it will not be the first time, nor will it be \nthe last time. \n17. During the same conversation on March 8, 2011, JUMAEV asked MUHTOROV is this \n\"the group of our brother?\" MUHTOROV told JUMAEV \"it is the second group.\"  In  . \norder to clarify, MUHTOROV asked JUMAEV ifhe remembered Juma Namangani. \nJUMAEV said he remembered Namangani very well.  MUHTOROV told JUMAEV that \n5 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 21\nit is the people of that brother, who after the martyrdom ofNamangani started their own \ngroup.  In response, JUMAEV agrees and tells MUHTOROV that they are with this \ngroup.  JUMAEV then warned MUHTOROV to be careful talking about Namangani and \nother sensitive information while on the phone.  JUMAEV warned MUHTOROV about \nsurveillance.  Both MUHTOROV and JUMAEV then cursed whoever might be listening \nin on their conversations and called upon Allah to punish those who do so.  JUMAEV \ntold MUHTOROV that ifhe sends \"it\" tomorrow, then he should get \"it\" by Friday. \n18. On or about March 16,2011, MUHTOROV received a call from JUMAEV.  JUMAEV \ntold MUHTOROV about an article he had recently read at the ferghana.ru website. \nAccording to JUMAEV, the article concerns the capture of two members of \nsodiqlar.com.  JUMAEV refers to them as two \"second rate sportsmen.\" JUMAEV \nadditionally states that he hopes it is not true and that it is just one of the tricks \"they use \nto destroy our faith.\" JUMAEV informed MUHTOROV of difficulties he experienced in \naccessing the sodiqlar.com website, but JUMAEV confirmed that he is able to access \nfurqon.com.  JUMAEVand MUHTOROV also discuss cell phones.  MUHTOROV asked \nwhether a new phone would work at \"the wedding house\" in case MUHTOROV travels \nthere. JUMAEV stated that this issue should be confirmed with \"the sportsmen brothers.\" \n19. On or about March 22-23,2011, MUHTOROV updated Muhammad on his efforts and \nintentions.  MUHTOROV committed himself to Bay'ah (an allegiance) to the IJU. \nMUHTOROV told Muhammad the he [MUHTOROV] was \"ready for any task, even \n6 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 21\nwith the risk of dying.\"  Muhammad later acknowledged having passed on \nMUHTOROV's Bay'ah to the IJU leadership. \n20. On or about July 12,2011, during a telephone conversation, MUHTOROV told \nJUMAEV that \"the wedding hosts\" from \"the wedding house\" are concerned that \nMuhtorov had not arrived.  MUHTOROV stated that he told them that he will come to \n\"the wedding.\"  JUMAEV told MUHTOROV that he received a letter to be fingerprinted \nin order to obtain his work authorization, but he was not excited because he did not really \nwant to stay in the United States.  JUMAEV stated that he wanted to join \"the wedding\" \nlike MUHTOROV and that he envied MUHTOROV.  JUMAEV said that ifhe \n[JUMAEV] went to \"the wedding,\" then upon his arrival MUHTOROV could come to \nmeet him.  MUHTOROV agreed. \n21. On or about July 15,2011, during a telephone conversation MUHTOROV told JUMAEV \nthat the brothers from the \"wedding house\" say hi to you.  JUMAEV then asked \nMUHTOROV to send his [JUMAEV's] best wishes to them. \n22. On or about October 9,2011, JUMAEV told MUHTOROV that a known associate \nwarned him [JUMAEV] not to have any sincere conversations on the phone or over the \ninternet.  JUMAEV stated that all communications were being monitored.  MUHTOROV \nagreed with JUMAEV, noting that authorities know everything being said on the phone. \n23. On or about October 28,2011, during a telephone conversation, MUHTOROV explained \nthat religious restriction toward Muslims in the western world will get only worse. \nMUHTOROV cited a restriction on Sharia (Islamic law) somewhere in Denmark. \n7 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 21\nJUMAEV stated that Western countries allow one to do anything in terms of lifestyle and \nbusiness except for being a Sunni extremist. JUMAEV explained that he watched a video \nof the mujahidin (holy warriors) in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region and that he cried \nsome, laughed some, and prayed some.  JUMAEV said that he took advice from the \nvideos and explained that the mujahidin are in another world and are the dear ones. \n24.  Between March 2011 and January 2012, during telephone conversations, JUMAEV and \nMUHTOROV utilized several different code words to discuss IJU activities, IJU videos \non the internet, and MUHTOROV's intent to travel overseas to join the IJU. \n25. On or about December 2,2011, JUMAEV called a known associate and told him that \nthey better meet sooner rather than later, as the associate may not see JUMAEV in this \nworld anymore.  JUMAEV says that they would see each other in the other world, but in \nthis world they cannot be certain. \n26. On or about January 7, 2012, during a telephone conversation, JUMAEV and \nMUHTOROV discussed MUHTOROV's inability to find his passport.  Using code, \nJUMAEV stated that MUHTOROV will not be able to join the IJU ifhe does not find the \npassport.  JUMAEV states that there is so much to discuss with MUHTOROV, but they \ncannot speak freely on the phone. \n27. On or about January 21,2012, MUHTOROV was arrested on a federal warrant at O'Hare \nInternational Airport while attempting to travel overseas.  MUHTOROV was arrested \nbased on a violation of Title 18, United States Code Section 2339B: Provision of Material \nSupport to a Designated Terrorist Organization, specifically provision and attempted \n8 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 21\nprovision of personnel to the IJU.  MUHTOROV was carrying approximately $2,800 in \ncash when he was arrested.  Immediately following his arrest MUHTOROV was \ninterviewed by the FBI.  During the interview MUHTOROV admitted to communicating \nwith Abu Muhammad at the sodiqlar.com web site.  MUHTOROV stated that \nsodiqlar.com is the website for the IJU, a combat organization that fights NATO forces in \nAfghanistan, to include U.S. forces.  MUHTOROV also described the IMU as another \nUzbek terrorist organization. \n28. On or about January 24,2012, during a telephone conversation with a known associate, \nJUMAEV discussed the arrest of MUHTOROV.  JUMAEV stated that MUHTOROV's \nphone will be checked and that JUMAEV's name will come up.  JUMAEV told the \nassociate that he is consulting with him to coordinate the story they will tell authorities \nshould they interview them.  JUMAEV stated that they should be on the same page when \nasked about MUHTOROV. \n29. On or about January 25,2012, YouTube records were obtained from Google, Inc. for \nJUMAEV's YouTube account.  These records display that JUMAEV has commented on \napproximately eight YouTube videos since on or about July 27,2011.  Several of the \nvideos contained violent action by terrorists and featured footage of the IMU co-founder \nYuldashev.  Many of JUMAEV's comments espoused support for the terrorists and/or \nYuldashev.  For example, on or about July 27,2011, JUMAEV posted a comment on an \napproximately 10 minute video showing several males in traditional Islamic dress, in a \nmountain region that appears to be Afghanistan or Pakistan, carrying rifles, and firing \nrockets and other weaponry.  The video indicated that it was produced by Jundullah \n9 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 21\nStudios, which according to open source reports is the official media wing of the IMU. \nIn response to the video, JUMAEV left a comment encapsulating a desire for Allah to be \npleased with these individuals. \n30. Based upon training and experience, your affiant knows that the term \"wedding\" or \n\"wedding activities\" in the instances above is used as code for terrorist activities, terrorist \nevents or terrorist attacks. \nOvert Acts in Furtherance of the Conspiracy \n31. On or about March 5, 2011, MUHTOROV emailed Abu Muhammad and stated that he \ndelivered Abu Muhammad's hello to JUMAEV.  MUHTOROV stated that JUMAEV \nwas very happy and sent many greetings to Abu Muhammad as well.  MUHTOROV \nstated that JUMAEV promised to send money, $300, to Abu Muhammad and the IJU \nthrough MUHTOROV. \n32. On or about March 8, 2011, in a lengthy conversation discussing support for the \"second \ngroup\" of Juma Namangani (i.e., the IJU), JUMAEV told MUHTOROV that ifhe sends \n\"it\" tomorrow, then MUHTOROV should get \"it\" by Friday. \n33. On or about March 15,2011, JUMAEV called MUHTOROV.  JUMAEVasked \nMUHTOROV whether he received the \"wedding gift,\" which JUMAEV sent last week. \nMUHTOROV replied that he had not received it yet, but that he had not yet checked his \nmail. \n10 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 21\n34. On or about April 2, 2011, MUHTOROV emailed Muhammad and explained that a \nbrother sent me $300 as a \"wedding gift\" for you.  Muhammad told MUHTOROV that he \nwould find out how the IJU wanted the money to be sent.  MUHTOROV asked to be \ninvited to the wedding, expressing his willingness to help with \"the wedding\" and to hear \nfrom the \"master of ceremonies\" about plans for \"the wedding.\" \n35. Bank records have been obtained which display that a $300 check dated on or about \nMarch 10,2011 was made out to MUHTOROV by a known associate of JUMAEV.  The \ncheck was thereafter cashed by MUHTOROV's wife on or about April 8, 2011.  FBI \ninvestigation determined that the associate had a close relationship with JUMAEV. \nMoreover, JUMAEV has previously used the associate's name to register for utility \nservices.  For example, JUMAEV's home telephone and internet service at 3131 \nRichmond Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is registered under the associate's name, \ndespite the associate not being a resident of 3131 Richmond Street. \n36.  On January 21,2012, MUHTOROV was arrested at Chicago O'Hare International \nAirport, carrying, amongst other things, about $2,800 in u.S. currency. \n37. On or about February 14,2012 and on or about February 24,2012, JUMAEV was \ninterviewed by the FBI at his residence.  During the interviews, JUMAEV stated that he \nwas friends with MUHTOROV and he had communicated with MUHTOROV utilizing \nhis T-Mobile mobile phone and a computer program known as Skype.  During the \n11 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 21\ninterview, FBI agents observed a Sony Vaio laptop computer in JUMAEV' s residence \nwith the Skype application running.  JUMAEV confirmed that he had no roommates and \nwas the only person residing at 3131 Richmond Street.  JUMAEV confirmed that he had \nknown of the IMU and the IJU since at least 2005 and that he had been aware since \nPresident Bush's presidency (some time prior to 2008) that both groups were designated \nterrorist organizations.  He also stated that that he knew that both the IMU and IJU were \nfighting u.S. soldiers in Afghanistan.  JUMAEV acknowledged that he knew that it was \nillegal to send any financial support to either the IMU or IJU.  JUMAEV stated that the \nnames Yuldashev and Namangani were synonymous with the IMU and that assisting \neither of them would mean that you would be assisting the IMU.  JUMAEV denied he \nsent money to the IMU or IJU.  JUMAEV confirmed however that he had sent a $300 \ncheck to MUHTOROV by using a known associate's checking account on or about \nMarch 10, 2011.  JUMAEV stated that it was his handwriting on the check and that he \npersonally mailed the check to MUHTOROV.  JUMAEV claimed that the $300 was \nrepayment of a debt. \n38. Your Affiant has applied his experience and knowledge to the evidence gathered during \nthe aforementioned investigation to conclude that JUMAEV conspired with \nMUHTOROV to provide money to the IJU while knowing that the IJU was a terrorist \norganization.  The conversations between JUMAEV and MUHTOROV, as well as the \nconversations between MUHTOROV and Muhammad, display that JUMAEV sent $300 \nto MUHTOROV through a known associate.  This was confirmed by JUMAEV himself. \nThe $300 represents the money that MUHTOROV told Muhammad that a brother \n12 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 21\npromised to send to him [Muhammad] and the IJU on March 5, 2011.  The conversations \nbetween MUHTOROV and JUMAEV establish that JUMAEV is aware of the IJU as \nwell as the fact that they are engaged in terrorist behavior.  This was also confirmed by \nJUMAEV himself.  The conversations between JUMAEV and MUHTOROV also display \nan agreement to provide help to the IJU.  The $300 represents material support that \nJUMAEV attempted to provide to the IJU through MUHTOROV.  MUHTOROV told \nMuhammad about JUMAEV's intent to send money on March 5, 2011, JUMAEV stated \nhe would send the money to MUHTOROV on March 8, 2011, and JUMAEV confirmed \nthat he had sent the money to MUHTOROV on March 15,2011. \nSEARCHING COMPUTERS \n39. As described above and in Attachment B, this affidavit is in support of an application \nseeking permission to search and seize records, computers, and electronic storage media \n(including cellular phones or other personal media devices) that might be found at \nBakhtiyor JUMAEV's residence, located at 3131 Richmond Street, Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania or within Bakhtiyor JUMAEV's possession.  Some of these electronic \nrecords might take the form of files, documents, and other data that is user-generated. \nSome of these electronic records, as explained below, might take a form that becomes \nmeaningful only upon forensic analysis. \n40. For example, based on knowledge, training, and experience, your affiant knows that a \npowered-on computer maintains volatile data.  Volatile data can be defined as active \ninformation temporarily reflecting a computer's current state including registers, caches, \nphysical and virtual memory, network connections, network shares, running processes, \n13 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 21\ndisks, floppy, tape and/or CD-ROM and printing activity.  Collected volatile data may \ncontain such information as opened files, connections to other computers, passwords used \nfor encryption, the presence of anti-forensic tools, or the presence of programs loaded in \nmemory that would otherwise go unnoticed.  Volatile data and its corresponding \nevidentiary value is lost when a computer is powered-off and unplugged. \n41. Based on knowledge, training, and experience, your affiant knows that computer files or \nremnants of such files can be recovered months or even years after they have been \ndownloaded onto a storage medium, deleted, or viewed via the Internet.  Electronic files \ndownloaded to a storage medium can be stored for years at little or no cost.  Even when \nfiles have been deleted, they can be recovered months or years later using forensic tools. \nThis is so because when a person \"deletes\" a file on a computer, the data contained in the \nfile does not actually disappear; rather, that data remains on the storage medium until it is \noverwritten by new data.  Therefore, deleted files, or remnants of deleted files, may \nreside in free space or slack space-that is, in space on the storage medium that is not \ncurrently being used by an active file-for long periods of time before they are \noverwritten.  In addition, a computer's operating system may also keep a record of \ndeleted data in a \"swap\" or \"recovery\" file. \n42. Also, again based on training and experience, wholly apart from user-generated files, \ncomputer storage media-in particular, computers' internal hard drives-contain electronic \nevidence of how a computer has been used, what it has been used for, and who has used \nit.  This evidence can take the form of operating system configurations, artifacts from \noperating system or application operation, file system data structures, and virtual memory \n14 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 21\n\"swap\"  or paging files.  Computer users typically do not erase or delete this evidence, \nbecause special software is typically required for that task.  However, it is technically \npossible to delete this information.  Data on the storage medium not currently associated \nwith any file can provide evidence of a file that was once on the storage medium but has \nsince been deleted or edited, or of a deleted portion of a file (such as a paragraph that has \nbeen deleted from a word processing file).  Web browsers, e-mail programs, and chat \nprograms store configuration information on the storage medium that can reveal \ninformation such as online nicknames and passwords.  Operating systems can record \nadditional information, such as the attachment of peripherals, the attachment of USB \nflash storage devices or other external storage media, and the times the computer was in \nuse.  Computer file systems can record information about the dates files were created and \nthe sequence in which they were created. \n43. As further described in Attachment B, this application seeks permission to locate not only \ncomputer files that might serve as direct evidence of the crimes described on the warrant, \nbut also for evidence that establishes how computers were used, the purpose of their use, \nwho used them, and when. \n44. Similarly, files that have been viewed via the Internet are sometimes automatically \ndownloaded into a temporary Internet directory or \"cache.\" The browser often maintains \na fixed amount of hard drive space devoted to these files, and the files are only \noverwritten as they are replaced with more recently viewed Internet pages or if a user \ntakes steps to delete them. \n15 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 21\n45. \"User attribution\" evidence can also be found on a computer and is analogous to the \nsearch for \"indicia of occupancy\" while executing a search warrant at a residence.  For \nexample, registry information, configuration files, user profiles, e-mail, e-mail address \nbooks, \"chat,\" instant messaging logs, photographs, and correspondence (and the data \nassociated with the foregoing, such as file creation and last accessed dates) may be \nevidence of who used or controlled the computer or storage medium at a relevant time. \n46. Searching computers for the evidence described in the attachment may require a range of \ndata analysis techniques.  For example, information regarding user attribution or Internet \nuse is located in various operating system log files that are not easily located or reviewed. \nOr, a person engaged in criminal activity will attempt to conceal evidence of the activity \nby \"hiding\" files or giving them deceptive names.  As explained above, because the \nwarrant calls for records of how a computer has been used, what it has been used for, and \nwho has used it, it is exceedingly likely that it will be necessary to thoroughly search \nstorage media to obtain evidence, including evidence that is not neatly orgariized into \nfiles or documents.  Just as a search of a premises for physical objects requires searching \nthe entire premises for those objects that are described by a warrant, a search of this \npremises for the things described in this warrant will likely require a search among the \ndata stored in storage media for the things (including electronic data) called for by this \nwarrant.  Additionally, it is possible that files have been deleted or edited, but that \nremnants of older versions are in unallocated space or slack space.  This, too, makes it \nexceedingly likely that in this case it will be necessary to use more thorough techniques. \n16 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 21\n47. Based upon knowledge, training and experience, your affiant knows that a thorough \nsearch for information stored in storage media often requires agents to seize most or all \nstorage media to be searched later in a controlled environment.  This is often necessary to \nensure the accuracy and completeness of data recorded on the storage media, and to \nprevent the loss of the data either from accidental or intentional destruction. \nAdditionally, to properly examine the storage media in a controlled environment, it is \noften necessary that some computer equipment, peripherals, instructions, and software be \nseized and examined in the controlled environment.  This is true because of the \nfollowing: \na.  The nature of evidence.  As noted above, not all evidence takes the form of \ndocuments and files that can be easily viewed on site.  Analyzing evidence of how \na computer has been used, what it has been used for, and who has used it requires \nconsiderable time, and taking that much time on premises could be unreasonable. \nb.  The volume of evidence.  Storage media can store the equivalent of millions of \npages of information. Additionally, a suspect may try to conceal criminal \nevidence; he or she might store it in random order with deceptive file names.  This \nmay require searching authorities to peruse all the stored data to determine which \nparticular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime.  This sorting process \ncan take weeks or months, depending on the volume of data stored, and it would \nbe impractical and invasive to attempt this kind of data search on-site. \n17 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 21\nc.  Technical requirements.  Computers can be configured in several different ways, \nfeaturing a variety of different operating systems, application software, and \nconfigurations.  Therefore, searching them sometimes requires tools or knowledge \nthat might not be present on the search site.  The vast array of computer hardware \nand software available makes it difficult to know before a search what tools or \nknowledge will be required to analyze the system and its data on-site.  However, \ntaking the storage media off-site and reviewing it in a controlled environment will \nallow its examination with the proper tools and knowledge. \nd.  Variety of forms of electronic media.  Records sought under this warrant could be \nstored in a variety of storage media formats that may require off-site reviewing \nwith specialized forensic tools. \n48. Based on training and experience, your affiant further states that if evidence located on a \ncomputer as described on Attachment B appears to relate to criminal acts other than those \noutlined in this affidavit, those items will not be further examined unless and until a \nsearch warrant is applied for and issued for evidence of any such separate criminal acts. \n49. Based upon the foregoing, your affiant believes there is probable cause to search: (1) the \nresidence located at 3131 Richmond Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; (2) any and all \ncomputers (including portable computer devices) located at 3131 Richmond Street, \nPhiladelphia, PA 19134, to include a Sony Vaio laptop computer, model number VGN-\nF8690, service tag of R5170004, and (3) aT-Mobile cellular telephone assigned \ntelephone number (267) 597-1321. \n18 \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 1   Filed 03/14/12   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 21\nI, Donald E.

Now I am \nready for any task, even if it means the risk of death. Whom should I send the wedding gift to?” Gov’t Trial Ex. 107A \nat 1. \n \n3  See, e.g., Trial Tr. at 1085:8-14 (“[Q.

If indeed government counsel read my Memorandum Opinion and Order on \nSentencing for Jumaev, the failure to address the issues therein is stunningly inexplicable. \n \n5  I  again  am  influenced  by  the  comments  of  Judge  George  O’Toole  in  United  States  v.  Mehanna,  No. \n  1:09-cr-10017-GAO (D. Mass. April 12, 2012), and of James P. McLoughlin, Jr. in Deconstructing United States \nSentencing  Guidelines  Section  3A1.4:  Sentencing  Failure  in  Cases  of  Financial  Support  for  Foreign  Terrorist \nOrganizations, 28 Law & Ineq. 51, 114-15 (2010), referenced in my Memorandum Opinion for Jumaev’s sentencing. \nSee Jumaev, 2018 WL 3490886, at *9. \n \n6  See United States v. Sanchez-Leon, 764 F.3d 1248, 1263-64 (10th Cir. 2014). While Muhtorov’s immigration \n  consequences and the time he will likely spend in ICE detention are not considered as a basis for departing under \nthe Guidelines, they are relevant for evaluating the severity of the punishment Muhtorov will endure for these \ncrimes and how to protect the public under 18 U.S.C. § 3553. \n \n7  Kate Stith & José Cabranes, Judging under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 91 NW.

R. 6, 7 (2013) \n  (observing that “[p]erhaps the most fundamental flaw in the Sentencing Guidelines is that they are based on the \nassumption that you can, in the name of reducing disparities, isolate from the complexity that every sentence \npresents a few arbitrary factors to which you then assign equally arbitrary weights— and somehow call the result “ \n‘rational’ ”); Mark Osler and Judge Mark W.

While I deemed it to be relevant for Jumaev, it is \n  particularly so for Muhtorov. Indeed, she comments that Moussaoui took on the jihadist cause “because it gave him \na role in the fight for social and economic justice.” Donahue at 54. \n \n11  The fact that he did so in an improper manner and that his oath was never accepted demonstrates that Muhtorov \n  was sloppy and the IJU took notice. It does not, however, undermine the genuineness of his commitment. \n \n12  See Sageman, supra, at 22 (observing generally that, in “trying to prevent a repeat of 9/11, [the U.S. government] \n  has again and again let its imagination run wild and responds to worst-case scenarios without objectively assessing \n  18 \n \n\n \nUnited States v.

By \n  “advising” judges to impose consecutive sentences until the Guidelines range is reached, usually at the statutory \nmaximum for the counts, a defendant’s sentence is potentially doubled when he or she is charged with conspiracy in \naddition to the underlying offense. \n \n20  I include in this review three cases in which the defendant’s statute of conviction was 18 U.S.C. § 2339A instead of § \n  2339B, noting the difference but finding the cases to still be relevant.

JAMSHID MUHTOROV, and  \n2.  BAKHTIYOR JUMAEV,  \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ JOINT MOTION FOR NOTICE OF THE SURVEILLANCE \nTECHNIQUES UTILIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS INVESTIGATION \nOF SAID DEFENDANTS \n \n \nJOINT MOTION  \n  The defendants, Jamshid Muhtorov and Bakhtiyor Jumaev, by and through their \ncounsel, move this Honorable Court to require the government to provide notice of the \nsurveillance techniques utilized by it in its investigation of said defendants, and they \ninform the Court as follows:  \nINTRODUCTION \nRecent disclosures have shown that the government uses a wide array of \nsurveillance programs to monitor the communications and activities of its investigative \ntargets and millions of others. Under various authorities, the government collects in bulk \nthe content of phone calls in and out of certain countries, the content of emails, location \ndata, electronic address books, calling records, and records of internet activity. Many of \nthese surveillance programs are operated by the Executive Branch without congressional \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 31\nor judicial oversight. They have never been reviewed by any court, let alone been the \nsubject of public or adversarial judicial review. All of them are warrantless and \nconducted without a finding of individualized suspicion.  \n  Notice of the government’s reliance on these surveillance techniques is essential \nto the due process rights of the defendants in this case. Without notice, the defendants \ncannot test whether the government’s evidence was, in fact, lawfully obtained—or \nwhether government surveillance conducted without a warrant and without probable \ncause violated the defendants’ rights. Notice of surreptitious electronic surveillance is \nroutinely required in criminal cases. Courts confronted this question with the advent of \nwiretapping decades ago and concluded that the government could not criminally \nprosecute an individual while keeping the sources of its evidence secret. Instead, \ndefendants are entitled to know how the government monitored their communications \nand activities, and then to test—in an adversarial proceeding—whether the government’s \nevidence is derived from that surveillance. See, e.g., United States v. U.S. District Court \n(Keith), 407 U.S. 297 (1972); Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969). \n  The government today has sought to carve out an exception to this due process \nrequirement. The government has routinely failed to provide notice of its surveillance \nactivities to courts and criminal defendants in cases like this one—thereby avoiding \njudicial review. It is withholding notice, reports show, based on a narrow interpretation of \nits legal obligations. \n   Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev respectfully request that the Court issue an order \nrequiring the government to provide notice of: (1) each surveillance technique it used to \nobtain information about the defendants’ communications or activities in its \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 31\ninvestigation; (2) the timing or duration of that surveillance; (3) the legal authority relied \nupon; and (4) the evidence obtained or derived from that surveillance. \nI.  The Government’s Investigation of the Defendants \nDefendants have been provided only limited discovery, but it is already clear that \nthe government’s investigations of Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev involved extensive \nmonitoring of their private communications and other activities. Yet the government has \nnever explained how it obtained much of this information, let alone which legal \nauthorities provided the basis for its surveillance of the defendants. Defendants \nsummarize certain elements of the government’s wide-ranging investigation here. \nIn 2005, the government designated the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU) in Uzbekistan \nas a terrorist organization. Muhtorov Compl. ¶ 11 (Doc. 1). Mr. Muhtorov came to the \nUnited States as a refugee in 2007; Mr. Jumaev moved to the United States in 2000. From \nthe time that both men arrived in the United States, they communicated with others—\nindividuals located in the U.S. and abroad—by phone, Skype, and email.  \nMr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev first met in November of 2009, when Mr. \nMuhtorov stayed at Mr. Jumaev’s home in Philadelphia for several weeks while Mr. \nMuhtorov attended truck-driving school. Shortly after Mr. Muhtorov left Philadelphia, \nimmigration authorities arrested Mr. Jumaev in February 2010 on the grounds that he had \noverstayed his visa. At that time, according to the government’s criminal complaint, Mr. \nJumaev provided authorities with his mobile phone number. See Jumaev Compl. ¶ 13 \n(Doc. 1, Case No. 12-mj-01039-KLM). Mr. Jumaev was released on bond from \nimmigration custody in April 2010. Family and friends, including Mr. Muhtorov, \ncontributed funds to help secure Mr. Jumaev’s release. Soon after the time of Mr. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 31\nJumaev’s release through the beginning of 2012, the defendants communicated \nfrequently over the phone and occasionally via Skype. \n  The government’s criminal complaints, as well as documents that it has produced \nin discovery thus far, show that its investigations of the defendants have relied on \nextensive surveillance of their internet-based communications and activities. According \nto its criminal complaint, the government monitored Mr. Muhtorov’s communications \nwith the website administrator and facilitator for www.sodiqlar.com, an Uzbek language \nwebsite that the government alleges is affiliated with the Islamic Jihad Union in \nUzbekistan. See Muhtorov Compl. ¶¶ 10, 12, 15–17, 26–27. The limited discovery \nprovided to defendants to date shows that the government intercepted communications \nbetween Mr. Muhtorov and the www.sodiqlar.com website administrator from January \n2011 to January 2012. In addition, the complaint describes the government’s monitoring \nof at least two email accounts allegedly belonging to Mr. Muhtorov. See Muhtorov \nCompl. ¶ 12. The government also tracked Mr. Muhtorov’s online searches, including his \nuse of a number of travel websites in May 2011 and January 2012. See id. ¶¶ 19, 31–32. \nLikewise, it appears to have tracked internet searches conducted by Mr. Muhtorov’s wife. \nSee id. ¶ 22.  \nThe government similarly tracked and monitored Mr. Jumaev’s internet \ncommunications and activities. It was aware of Mr. Jumaev’s visits to www.furqon.com, \na website allegedly associated with the IJU; his watching of videos on political and \nreligious matters; and his alleged commenting on YouTube videos. See Jumaev Compl. ¶ \n29. It has also produced intercepted communications between Mr. Jumaev and third \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 31\nparties—including his wife and children—who reside in various foreign countries, \nincluding Uzbekistan.  \nThe government likewise tracked and monitored the defendants’ phone calls, \nincluding those within the United States. See, e.g., Muhtorov Compl. ¶¶ 12, 14, 21–24, \n28; Jumaev Compl. ¶¶ 13, 16–18, 20–26, 28. As shown by the government’s productions \nto date, the government intercepted hundreds of phone calls between January 2011 and \nJanuary 2012 that involved Mr. Muhtorov. Many of these communications were with Mr. \nJumaev. \nThe government also tracked and monitored the defendants’ financial \ntransactions. Beginning in 2007, Mr. Muhtorov used MoneyGram and similar services to \nsend money to individuals both inside the United States and abroad. Likewise, from the \ntime of his arrival in the United States in 2000 through the time of his arrest in this matter \nin March 2012, Mr. Jumaev regularly used similar services to send money to individuals \nabroad. The government plainly collected financial records and information about the \ndefendants. See, e.g., Bates No. G_000303 (describing an FBI trash cover effected \noutside of Mr. Jumaev’s residence on January 17, 2011, in which agents reported finding \na MoneyGram receipt for $300). According to its criminal complaint against Mr. Jumaev, \nthe government obtained bank records showing that a $300 check was made out to Mr. \nMuhtorov by a friend of Mr. Jumaev in March 2011. See Jumaev Compl. ¶ 35.  \nAlthough the unclassified documents produced in discovery go back no earlier \nthan January 2011, there is reason to believe that the government was monitoring the \ndefendants’ communications and activities far earlier—even prior to January 2010, when \nimmigration authorities commenced removal proceedings against Mr. Jumaev. Of course, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 31\nthese removal proceedings did not occur in a vacuum, but likely occurred in parallel with \nthe government’s criminal investigations of each defendant. In both its criminal \ninvestigation and the removal action, the government most likely relied on information \ngathered through surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov—and by extension, surveillance of Mr. \nJumaev—before January 2010. \nII.  The Government Is Withholding Notice from Criminal Defendants Based on \nSecret Legal Interpretations \nOver the past year, it has become increasingly evident that the government is \nwithholding notice of its reliance on controversial spying programs in criminal \nprosecutions. In doing so, the government is preventing defendants from challenging \nsweeping new forms of surveillance, often conducted without any warrant or prior \njudicial review. Recent reports indicate that the government holds an unjustifiably narrow \nview of its notice obligations, even when it relies on novel and legally untested \nsurveillance programs in criminal prosecutions.1  \nThis prosecution has already become a case-in-point for the government’s failure \nto comply with its notice obligations. Mr. Muhtorov learned that he had been surveilled \nby the NSA under the FISA Amendments Act (“FAA”) in October 2013—but only \nbelatedly and only after the government had failed to provide such a notice to any \ndefendant for five years. During that time, the government had avoided court review of \nits surveillance activities by relying on an undisclosed and “narrow understanding” of its \n                                                 \n1 See, e.g., Charlie Savage, Reagan-Era Order on Surveillance Violates Rights, Says \nDeparting Aide, N.Y. Times, Aug. 13, 2014, http://nyti.ms/1wPw6l0 (“Savage 12,333 \nArticle”). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 31\nnotice obligations.2 The government altered course last year, but only after the Solicitor \nGeneral had inaccurately described the government’s FAA notice policy to the Supreme \nCourt.3 Following public outcry, the Solicitor General apparently concluded that the \nJustice Department’s FAA notice policy “could not be legally justified.” Savage FAA \nArticle. Mr. Muhtorov then received what the government calls a “Second FISA Notice” \n(Doc. 457)—more than a year-and-a-half after the government filed its original notice in \nthis case.4 Four other defendants around the country have also received belated notices, \nalmost all of them after they had already been tried or convicted.5 \nThe public record shows that the government continues to withhold notice of \nmany other controversial surveillance programs. In particular, in a recent report, \n                                                 \n2 Charlie Savage, Door May Open for Challenge to Secret Wiretaps, N.Y. Times, Oct. \n16, 2013, http://nyti.ms/1r7mbDy (“Savage FAA Article”). \n3 See Savage FAA Article; Adam Liptak, A Secret Surveillance Program Proves \nChallengeable in Theory Only, N.Y. Times, July 15, 2013, http://nyti.ms/12ANzNM. \n4 The government has repeatedly offered misleading explanations for its long-running \nfailure to provide notice. It has told this Court and at least three others that, prior to 2013, \nit had not “considered” the issue of FAA-derived evidence. See, e.g., Gov’t Unclassified \nMem. in Opp. to Def. Mot. to Suppress Evidence at 9 n.2, United States v. Muhtorov, No. \n12-cr-33 (D. Colo. May 9, 2014) (Doc. 559). But that is demonstrably false. The issue \nwas brought to the attention of Justice Department lawyers at least as early as 2011, when \na defendant in United States v. Khan filed a motion focused on this precise question. Mot. \nfor Clarification, No. 11-cr-20331 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 14, 2011) (ECF No. 219). The issue \nwas raised again in 2012—in the Supreme Court, by the plaintiffs in Clapper v. Amnesty \nInternational USA. Br. for Respondents at 58 n.22, Clapper, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (Sept. 17, \n2012). Moreover, multiple news reports indicate that NSD attorneys had considered the \nissue long before 2013, had decided that notice of evidence derived from FAA \nsurveillance was not required, and had taken active steps to avoid ever giving notice of \nFAA surveillance in criminal cases. See, e.g., Savage FAA Article (explaining that NSD \nhad “long used a narrow understanding of what ‘derived from’ means” to avoid providing \nnotice). \n5 Those cases are: United States v. Hasbajrami, No. 11 Cr. 623 (E.D.N.Y.) (post-\nconviction notice); United States v. Mihalik, No. CR 11-833(A) (C.D. Cal.) (post-\nconviction notice); United States v. Mohamud, No. 10-cr-475 (D. Or.) (post-trial notice); \nUnited States v. Khan, No. 12-CR-659 (D. Or.). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 31\ngovernment officials insisted that “defendants have no right to know” if investigators \nderived evidence from any of the government’s sweeping surveillance activities under \nExecutive Order 12,333. Savage 12,333 Article. That position conflicts directly with the \nright of defendants—under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and the “fruit of the \npoisonous tree” doctrine—to seek suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence.

It is also clear that the government is not \nproviding notice to criminal defendants when investigators rely on the NSA’s bulk \ncollection of phone records and email metadata. Although both of these domestic \nsurveillance programs operated for a decade or more—and tips were routinely fed to FBI \ninvestigators—no defendant has ever received official notice from the government. See \nSections III.B–C. \nCompounding these problems, the government has refused to publicly explain its \nnotice policies in any detail. Despite the efforts of defendants around the country, the \ngovernment has refused in this case and others to disclose its view of its notice \nobligations.6 There is no reason for this secrecy, except to keep courts and defendants \nfrom ascertaining whether the government is providing notice when it should be. Recent \nevents have shown that it is not. \n                                                 \n6 See, e.g., Def. Response at 8–16, United States v. Qazi, 12-cr-60298 (S.D. Fla.

The Government Must Provide Notice of the Surveillance Programs It Used \nin Its Investigation of the Defendants \nA.  Surveillance Under Executive Order 12,333 \nThere is reason to believe that some of Mr. Muhtorov’s and Mr. Jumaev’s \ncommunications were obtained under Executive Order 12,333, which serves as the \n“primary source” of the NSA’s foreign intelligence-gathering authority and governs most \nsurveillance conducted abroad.7 According to the NSA’s own documents, the agency \n“conducts the majority of its [signals intelligence] activities solely pursuant to” E.O. \n12,333.8 Over the past year, it has grown increasingly clear that the scale of the \ngovernment’s surveillance under E.O. 12,333 is vast—and that the government uses this \ninformation when investigating individuals here in the United States.9 Under this \nauthority, the NSA collects both content—such as phone calls, emails, and text \nmessages—and so-called “metadata” like phone records, records of internet activity, and \nlocation information.  \nRecent reports show just how expansive the government’s surveillance under E.O. \n12,333 has become. These reports indicate that the NSA is, among other things:  \n  Recording and storing every single cell phone call in and out of at least two \ncountries, including the Bahamas.10 \n                                                 \n7 NSA Overview of Signals Intelligence Authorities, Jan. 8, 2007, at 4, \nhttp://bit.ly/1ruKbBk; see 3 C.F.R. 202, 210–212 (1981), reprinted as amended, note \nfollowing 50 U.S.C. § 401, pp. 543, 547–548. \n8 NSA Legal Fact Sheet: Executive Order 12333, Jun. 19, 2013, at 1, \nhttp://bit.ly/1CG9EtT. \n9 See Savage 12,333 Article; Two Sets of Rules for Surveillance, Within U.S. and on \nForeign Soil, N.Y.

Even purely domestic communications or \ndata may be routed or stored abroad without a person ever realizing it, leaving that data \nvulnerable to collection under E.O. 12,333.19 \nIn this case, the government has relied on, among other things, its interception of \nMr. Muhtorov’s international communications with the administrator of \nwww.sodiqlar.com, a non-U.S. person located abroad; Mr. Jumaev’s visits to foreign-\nbased websites; and Mr. Jumaev’s communications via phone and other electronic \nmethods with persons overseas. It is likely that some or all of these communications were \neither collected pursuant to E.O. 12,333, or were collected based on information derived \nfrom earlier E.O. 12,333 surveillance.20  \n                                                 \n18 See, e.g., Savage 12,333 Article; John Napier Tye, Op-Ed, Meet Executive Order \n12333: The Reagan Rule That Lets the NSA Spy on Americans, Wash.

Policy Research Conf. (Aug. 27, 2014), \nhttp://bit.ly/1lWB4I4. \n20 Although the FBI says that it obtained “court authorization” to acquire some of Mr. \nMuhtorov’s emails, see Muhtorov Compl. ¶ 12, that is not inconsistent with the \ngovernment’s reliance on E.O. 12,333 to acquire the defendants’ communications. For \nexample, it is possible that the NSA first acquired Mr. Muhtorov’s emails via E.O. \n12,333 and subsequently tipped the FBI, which then obtained the same communications \nand/or others pursuant to court authorization. In that case, the government’s evidence \nwould still be derived from E.O. 12,333 surveillance of the defendant, and Mr. Muhtorov \nwould still be entitled to notice. A similar scenario may have occurred with Mr. Jumaev. \nThe FBI obtained Mr. Jumaev’s mobile phone number as part of his immigration arrest in \nFebruary 2010, which the government may then have used to query information it had \nalready obtained under E.O. 12,333, or to collect information under other undisclosed \nlegal authorities. See Jumaev Compl. ¶ 13 (claiming, without detail, that the FBI used \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 31\nSurveillance programs operated under E.O. 12,333 have never been reviewed by \nany court. Moreover, these programs are not governed by any statute, including FISA, \nand, as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee has conceded, they are not \noverseen in any meaningful way by Congress.21 Instead, this surveillance is conducted \nentirely under Executive Branch authority, on the basis of a presidential directive first \nissued by President Reagan in 1981. As a result, there are few statutory or practical \nconstraints on the government’s use of this authority, even when it sweeps in huge \nquantities of Americans’ data overseas. As a former State Department official recently \nwrote, “Executive Order 12333 contains nothing to prevent the NSA from collecting and \nstoring all such communications—content as well as metadata—provided that such \ncollection occurs outside the United States in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence \ninvestigation. No warrant or court approval is required, and such collection never need be \nreported to Congress.”22  \nBased on the public record, the government rarely provides notice to criminal \ndefendants when its investigation has relied upon surveillance conducted under E.O. \n12,333. In fact, according to unnamed government officials, the Department of Justice \nbelieves that it has no legal obligation to provide notice to defendants, at least where its \n                                                 \n“appropriate authority” to obtain information about Mr. Jumaev “through various \ninvestigative techniques”) \n21 See Ali Watkins, Most of NSA’s Data Collection Authorized by Order Ronald Reagan \nIssued, McClatchy, Nov. 21, 2013, http://bit.ly/1lCXFsC. \n22 John Napier Tye, Op-Ed, Meet Executive Order 12333: The Reagan Rule That Lets the \nNSA Spy on Americans, Wash.

The NSA Call-Records Program \nIt is also extremely likely that the government’s investigation of Mr. Muhtorov \nand Mr. Jumaev relied on its bulk collection of Americans’ phone records. For more than \na decade, the NSA has been collecting call records in bulk from major domestic \ntelecommunications companies. The government conducts this program under Section \n215 of the Patriot Act, 50 U.S.C. § 1861.24 As currently operated, the government \npresents multiple telecommunications carriers with secret court orders requiring them to \nproduce to the NSA “on an ongoing daily basis . . . all call detail records or ‘telephony \nmetadata’” relating to every domestic and international call placed on their networks.25 \nThe orders, which are renewed every ninety days, further specify that the phone records \nsought include, for each call, the originating and terminating telephone number as well as \nthe call’s time and duration. Once collected, the bulk call records are stored in a \ngovernment database for five years, where the NSA queries those records—hundreds or \nthousands of times each year—to search for unknown connections between its \n                                                 \n23 Savage 12,333 Article (“[O]fficials contend that defendants have no right to know if \n12333 intercepts provided a tip from which investigators derived other evidence.”). \n24 See Order, In re Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Prod. of Tangible \nThings from [Redacted], No. BR 06-05 (FISC May 24, 2006), http://1.usa.gov/1f28pHg; \nsee USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Pub.

In this case, the \ngovernment has pointed to hundreds of phone calls made or received by the defendants. \nSee Section I. Some of the phone calls between Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev—or \nbetween the defendants and others—may initially have been identified using precisely \nthis program. Moreover, the government may have relied, in part, on phone records the \nNSA collected in 2009, when it was still violating the court-ordered rules that restricted \nits collection, use, and dissemination of this sensitive information. See Section I \n(discussing communications between the defendants in 2009).  \n                                                 \n26 See Primary Order, In re Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Prod. of \nTangible Things from [Redacted], No. BR 14-96 (FISC June 19, 2014), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/1oLUFtg. \n27 See, e.g., Order at 8–9, In re Prod. of Tangible Things From [Redacted], No. BR 08-13 \n(FISC Mar. 2, 2009), http://bit.ly/1rJup07 (finding that the government’s “failure to \nensure that responsible officials adequately understood the NSA’s alert process, and to \naccurately report its implementation to the Court, has prevented, for more than two years, \nboth the government and the FISC from taking steps to remedy daily violations”). \n28 See, e.g., id. at 13 (describing 2,549 telephone numbers that the NSA tipped to the FBI, \nand the FBI’s investigation of U.S. persons based on such tips). \n29 See, e.g., Primary Order 8–9, In re Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the \nProd. of Tangible Things from [Redacted], No. BR 11-07 (FISC Jan. 20, 2011), \nhttp://1.usa.gov/1tyykiI (approving for querying “[i]dentifiers that are currently the \nsubject of electronic surveillance” authorized by the FISC). \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 31\nThe NSA’s call-records program has been deemed unconstitutional by one court \nbecause it violates the Fourth Amendment,30 yet the government has never provided \nofficial notice of this surveillance to a single criminal defendant. Only one defendant has \never learned that the program was used in his case—United States v. Moalin, No. 10-CR-\n4246 (S.D. Cal.)—and he only discovered that fact after his trial was over, when \ngovernment officials sought to justify the bulk call-records program by pointing to his \ncase in congressional testimony.31 In short, the government appears to believe that it has \nno legal obligation to tell criminal defendants when it relies on evidence derived from the \nNSA’s bulk collection of call records. \nC.  The NSA Internet-Metadata Program \n  The government’s investigations of Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev may well have \nrelied on yet another bulk-collection program: the NSA’s internet-metadata program. \nFrom 2001 to 2011, the NSA tracked the online activities of Americans by collecting \ninternet metadata in bulk. (The program is sometimes known as the NSA’s “PR/TT” \nprogram because, beginning in 2004, it was operated on the basis of FISA’s pen \nregister/trap-and-trace provisions, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1841–1846.) Under this program, the \ngovernment acquired multiple types of internet records, including information about the \nsenders and recipients of email messages and records of internet activity.32 Once \n                                                 \n30 Klayman v.

Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \n113th Cong. (June 18, 2013), http://1.usa.gov/1mz0YjI (statement of FBI Deputy \nDirector Sean Joyce). \n32 For instance, the government may have also collected information about internet \ntransactions such as logging into or out of a web-based account, or the processing of an \ninstant message communication. See Memorandum Opinion at 34–35, [Redacted], No. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 31\ncollected, the internet records were stored in a government database for several years, \nwhere the NSA queried those records to search for connections between its targets and \nothers—much as it does using the call-records program discussed above.  \nThe FBI, DOJ, and other agencies used information derived from the internet-\nmetadata program in the course of investigations for years—including the period covered \nby the government’s investigation in this case.33 At one point, the NSA estimated that \nhundreds of accounts would be “tipped” to the FBI and CIA each year under the program, \nand that approximately 25 percent of those accounts would be associated with U.S. \npersons.34 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) imposed a number of \nrestrictions on the NSA’s ability to disseminate information obtained under this \nprogram—yet, from 2004 through at least 2009, the government repeatedly violated those \ncourt-ordered restrictions.35  \nIndeed, for years, the NSA failed to abide by the FISC’s rules for collecting, \nquerying, and handling internet metadata.36 From the outset of the PR/TT program, the \nNSA continuously and systematically over-collected Americans’ internet records in \n                                                 \nPR/TT [Redacted] (FISC [Redacted]) (Bates, J.), http://1.usa.gov/1q3af5P (“FISC 2010 \nOp.”). \n33 See, e.g., Decl. of Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander at 16 n.7, No. PR/TT [Redacted] (FISC \n[Redacted]), http://bit.ly/1r4t72o (describing the NSA’s provision of “research to \nDepartment of Justice or Department of Defense personnel for their review in connection \nwith criminal or detainee proceedings”). \n34 See Opinion & Order at 46, [Redacted], No. PR/TT [Redacted] (FISC [Redacted]) \n(Kollar-Kotelly, J.), http://1.usa.gov/1lPEe07 (“FISC 2004 Op.”). \n35 FISC 2010 Op. at 12, 17–22; FISC 2004 Op. at 80–87. \n36 FISC 2010 Op. at 9–22 (describing the NSA’s “substantial non-compliance” and \n“systemic overcollection” of metadata); Order at 6–7, [Redacted], No. PR/TT [Redacted] \n& In re Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things \nFrom [Redacted], No. BR 09-06 (FISC June 22, 2009), http://1.usa.gov/1tioe5f. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 31\nviolation of the FISC’s orders, which had authorized the collection of only specified \ncategories of metadata. According to the government, for several years, “virtually every \nPR/TT record” generated by the program contained some illegally collected data.37  \nAlthough the FISC acknowledged these violations in 2010, it did not require the \ngovernment to identify and destroy all of the illegally acquired information. Instead, it \nallowed the government to retain and search this data so long as it claimed not to know \nwhether the information was acquired through unauthorized electronic surveillance.38 In \nDecember 2011, the government reportedly decided not to seek reauthorization of the \ninternet-metadata program for operational reasons.39 \nAs discussed above, the government relies on intercepted email communications \nas well as records of Mr. Muhtorov’s and Mr. Jumaev’s other internet activities—\nactivities that may have first been tracked through the bulk collection of the defendants’ \ninternet metadata. See Section I. Because the government’s investigation was active in \n2011—and, in all likelihood, in 2010—it likely relied on information collected during \nprecisely the period when the NSA operated the PR/TT program in violation of court-\nordered rules. \nEven beyond these compliance violations, the NSA’s internet-metadata program \nraises constitutional and statutory questions on par with the NSA’s call-records program. \nCf.

Although FISA expressly requires notice \nof this surveillance, see 50 U.S.C. 1845(c), the government has never provided notice of \nthe NSA’s internet-metadata program to a single criminal defendant. \nD.  Bulk Collection of Financial Records \nThere is evidence also that the government collects financial records in bulk—\nincluding international money transfers like those the government monitored in this \ninvestigation. In November 2013, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal \nreported that the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) was collecting records of these \ntransfers in bulk from companies like Western Union and MoneyGram.40 The financial \nrecords program is reportedly conducted under Section 215, 50 U.S.C. § 1861. The CIA \nhas used the information it collects in bulk to amass “a vast database of international \nmoney transfers that includes millions of Americans’ financial and personal data,” \nincluding Social Security numbers.41 The data is analyzed by the CIA and then shared \nwith other agencies like the FBI. According to a former official, “[I]f a CIA analyst \nsearches the data and discovers possible suspicious terrorist activity in the U.S., the \nanalyst provides that information to the FBI.”42 No criminal defendant, however, has ever \nreceived notice of the government’s reliance on this bulk collection program. \n                                                 \n40 Charlie Savage & Mark Mazzetti, C.I.A.

See \nSection I (describing Mr. Muhtorov’s use of these international monetary services since \nat least 2007 and Mr. Jumaev’s use of them between 2000 and 2012). The FBI claims that \nit obtained evidence of one such transfer by searching Mr. Jumaev’s trash, see Bates No. \nG_000303, but that may be one instance of the “parallel construction” that law-\nenforcement agencies reportedly use to conceal tips and leads they receive from \nintelligence agencies.43 Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev are entitled to notice if the \ngovernment’s investigation relied on the bulk collection of their financial records. \nE.  Other Surveillance Techniques \nGiven the number of surveillance programs the government concealed for years, it \nis possible that the government relied on other, still-secret surveillance techniques in its \ninvestigations of Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev. Disclosures suggest that it may have \ntracked the defendants’ locations, other financial activities, or various other kinds of \ncommunications data. Defendants’ motion to compel notice is not limited to the \nsurveillance programs described above or surveillance methods the government has \npublicly acknowledged to date.44 Rather, it encompasses any surveillance program or \ntechnique that the government used to monitor the defendants’ communications or \nactivities as part of its investigation.  \n                                                 \n43 See John Shiffman & Kristina Cooke, Exclusive: U.S. Directs Agents to Cover Up \nProgram Used to Investigate Americans, Reuters, Aug. 5, 2013, http://reut.rs/1h07Hkl \n(describing DEA’s use of “parallel construction” to conceal its reliance on information \nderived from NSA surveillance). \n44 See Charlie Savage & Mark Mazzetti, C.I.A.

The Defendants Are Entitled to Notice \nA.  Due Process Entitles the Defendants to Notice \nMr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev are entitled to notice of the surveillance \ntechniques that contributed to the government’s investigation, so that they may challenge \nthe legality of the surveillance and the admissibility of the resulting evidence. The \ngovernment cannot preempt the right to seek suppression by withholding notice based on \nits own conclusion that its methods were lawful. Rather, the defendants are entitled to \nhave the Court—not the government—decide issues going to their basic constitutional \nrights. Those questions include (1) whether the government’s surveillance violated the \nFourth Amendment or other legal protections, and (2) whether the government’s evidence \nis in fact “derived” from such surveillance. See, e.g., United States v. U.S. District Court \n(Keith), 407 U.S. 297 (1972); Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969). \nThe only way to effectuate a criminal defendant’s right to suppress illegally \nacquired evidence is through notice. This suppression right becomes especially important \nwhen the government adopts new and intrusive surveillance techniques. By now, it is \nclear that the government routinely employs legally untested surveillance methods in aid \nof investigations like this one—and that it often seeks to conceal those methods in order \nto avoid court review.45 But due process rights grounded in the Fourth and Fifth \nAmendments entitle the defendants to challenge the legality of these surveillance \n                                                 \n45 See Savage 12,333 Article (describing continuing efforts to avoid giving notice of E.O. \n12,333 surveillance); Savage FAA Article (describing five-year effort to avoid giving \nnotice of FAA surveillance); John Shiffman & Kristina Cooke, Exclusive: U.S. Directs \nAgents to Cover Up Program Used to Investigate Americans, Reuters, Aug. 5, 2013, \nhttp://reut.rs/1h07Hkl (describing use of “parallel construction” to conceal reliance on \ninformation obtained from intelligence agencies). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 31\ntechniques and to seek suppression of the resulting evidence. See Wong Sun v. United \nStates, 371 U.S. 471, 486–88 (1963) (describing “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine); \nMurray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533, 536–37 (1988) (describing right to seek \nsuppression of evidence “derived” from an unlawful search).46  \nThe exercise of the suppression right depends entirely on notice. Thus, courts \nhave long found notice a constitutionally required element of surreptitious searches like \nwiretaps and sneak-and-peak entries. See Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 60 (1967) \n(finding wiretapping statute unconstitutional because, among other things, it had “no \nrequirement for notice as do conventional warrants”); United States v. Freitas, 800 F.2d \n1451, 1456 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding sneak-and-peak warrant constitutionally defective for \nits failure to provide explicitly for notice within a reasonable time); United States v. \nDalia, 441 U.S. 238, 247–48 (1979) (observing that Title III provided “a constitutionally \nadequate substitute for advance notice by requiring that once the surveillance operation is \ncompleted the authorizing judge must cause notice to be served on those subjected to \nsurveillance” (emphasis added)).  \n                                                 \n46 The defendants’ right to notice is also found within the government’s Brady obligation. \nIn order to comply with that requirement, the government must disclose any information \nmaterial to a defendant’s motion to suppress evidence. See United States v. Gamez-\nOrduno, 235 F.3d 453, 461 (9th Cir. 2000); Smith v. Black, 904 F.2d 950, 965–66 (5th \nCir. 1990), vacated on other grounds, 503 U.S. 930 (1992) (due process mandates the \ndisclosure of information in the government’s possession if nondisclosure would “affect[] \nthe outcome of [a] suppression hearing”). It goes without saying that in order to seek \nsuppression, the defendants must be aware of the surveillance that served as the source(s) \nof the government’s evidence. As a result, Brady requires the government to give notice \nof the surveillance techniques used to monitor the communications or activities of the \ndefendants that were relied upon in the investigation, and the information obtained or \nderived from that surveillance. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 31\nCongress has responded to these rulings by incorporating express notice \nprovisions into many surveillance statutes. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(d) (Title III); S. \nRep. No. 1097, at 2194 (1968) (explaining the inclusion of a notice requirement in Title \nIII’s wiretapping provisions, and citing Berger); see also 50 U.S.C. § 1806(c) (FISA \nelectronic surveillance); id. § 1825(d) (FISA physical search); id. § 1842(c) (FISA pen \nregister); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(f) (requiring notice). \nAs the cases above show, today is not the first time courts have had to confront \nthe government’s use of new technologies to carry out surreptitious searches. The use of \nsecret wiretapping and electronic recording devices in criminal investigations posed \nsimilarly novel legal problems in the last century. The courts that addressed the legality \nof these methods—and laid down the rules governing their use—were only able to do so \nbecause the defendants received notice of that surveillance. Thus, in Keith, the \ngovernment responded to the defendant’s motion to compel the disclosure of electronic \nsurveillance information in a national-security prosecution by publicly acknowledging \nthat investigators had overheard the defendant’s conversations using wiretaps. 407 U.S. at \n299–300. In Kyllo, the defendant had notice that the government’s search warrant \napplication relied on evidence gathered using thermal-imaging technology. Kyllo v. \nUnited States, 533 U.S. 27, 29–30 (2001). Likewise, in Jones, the defendant had notice of \nthe government’s use of GPS tracking in order to record his movements. United States v. \nJones, 132 S. Ct. 945, 948 (2011). All of these seminal Fourth Amendment decisions \nwould have been impossible if the defendants had not received notice of the \ngovernment’s secret searches. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 31\nEqually here, the Court must ensure that the defendants have sufficient notice of \nany surveillance of their communications or activities to allow them to press their claims \nfairly before the Court. For the reasons described above, it appears extremely unlikely \nthat the government has applied such a standard in making its notice determinations in \nthis case. For instance, the government apparently believes that it has no obligation to \ngive notice any time its evidence is derived from E.O. 12,333 surveillance. See Savage \n12,333 Article (describing the government’s view that “defendants have no right to \nknow” if investigators derived evidence from an E.O. 12,333 intercept). Similarly, the \ngovernment appears to believe that it has no obligation to provide notice when it relies on \nthe NSA’s bulk collection of call records in criminal investigations, see Section III.B—\nperhaps because it does not believe its collection and querying of these records \nconstitutes a “search.” But the call-records program plainly presents novel questions of a \nconstitutional dimension, and one court has already found the program unlawful. See \nKlayman v. Obama, 957 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2013). It is not the government’s \nprerogative to secretly and self-servingly conclude that its surveillance is legal and then \nto withhold notice from criminal defendants on that basis. \nThis point is a commonsense one. Due process entitles the defendants to test, on \nthe facts of this case, whether the government’s evidence should be suppressed as the \nfruit of unlawful surveillance. Due process does not leave these questions to the \ngovernment’s sole judgment and discretion. See Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, \n168 (1969) (recounting, in wiretapping challenge, Supreme Court’s refusal “to accept the \nex parte determination of relevance by the Department of Justice in lieu of adversary \nproceedings in the District Court”); Kolod v. United States, 390 U.S. 136, 136–37 (1968) \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 31\n(prior proceedings); cf., e.g., United States v. Eastman, 465 F.2d 1057, 1062–63 & n.13 \n(3d Cir. 1972) (concluding that the Wiretap Act’s statutory notice provision was \n“intended to provide the defendant whose telephone has been subject to wiretap an \nopportunity to test the validity of the wiretapping authorization”). It would make little \nsense if the government could pre-determine, as part of its notice analysis, difficult or \nnovel legal questions that a defendant would properly put before the Court—if only he \nknew. \nThe government’s definition of “derived” evidence is especially opaque and \nproblematic—yet notice in many cases turns on that definition. According to reports, the \ngovernment has long held a “narrow understanding of what ‘derived from’ means in \nterms of when it must disclose specifics to defendants” in the context of foreign-\nintelligence surveillance. Savage FAA Article. The government has never publicly \ndescribed that “narrow understanding”—either before or after its notice policies began to \ndraw scrutiny in the past year. But the consequences are significant. If the government is \ndefining “derived” evidence more narrowly than the Constitution allows,47 and \nwithholding notice on that basis, then it is concealing the underlying sources of its \nevidence, and thereby insulating them from judicial review. The government’s failure to \nprovide notice of FAA surveillance in this case or any other for five years relied on \nprecisely this type of evidence laundering. See id. Similarly, when the government \nengages in parallel construction—in order to conceal the nature of its underlying \n                                                 \n47 See, e.g., Murray, 487 U.S. at 536–37 (prohibiting “the introduction of derivative \nevidence, both tangible and testimonial, that is the product of the [unlawful search], or \nthat is otherwise acquired as an indirect result of the unlawful search, up to the point at \nwhich the connection with the unlawful search becomes ‘so attenuated as to dissipate the \ntaint’”). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 31\ninvestigation—that is a refusal to give notice of “derived” evidence as due process \nrequires.48 \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that when the government chooses \nto criminally prosecute an individual, it may not keep secret the sources of its evidence.  \n[T]he Government can invoke its evidentiary privileges only at the price \nof letting the defendant go free. The rationale of the criminal cases is that, \nsince the Government which prosecutes an accused also has the duty to \nsee that justice is done, it is unconscionable to allow it to undertake \nprosecution and then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the \naccused of anything which might be material to his defense. \n \nJencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 670–71 (1957) (quoting United States v. Reynolds, \n345 U.S. 1, 12 (1953)). Simply put, the government may not have it both ways—its \nsecrecy and its prosecution—when an individual’s liberty is at stake. Indeed, due process \nrequires not only notice to a defendant, but may also call for disclosure of underlying \nsurveillance applications or intercepts. In Keith, the Supreme Court compelled the \ngovernment to turn over records of wiretapped conversations in a national-security case, \neven as the government threatened to abandon the prosecution if required to disclose \nthem. See 407 U.S. at 318–24, aff’g 444 F.2d 651, 655 (6th Cir. 1971) (discussing the \ngovernment’s assertions). The Court did not blink—it ordered disclosure. See 407 U.S. at \n324. The government is bound by that same choice here, wherever it has relied on \nundisclosed surveillance programs in the conduct of its investigation. \nAccordingly, the government must give notice of the surveillance techniques that \ncontributed to its investigation of Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev—so that the Court may \nultimately decide whether there is a legal and factual basis for suppression. \n                                                 \n48 See, e.g., John Shiffman & Kristina Cooke, Exclusive: U.S. Directs Agents to Cover Up \nProgram Used to Investigate Americans, Reuters, Aug. 5, 2013, http://reut.rs/1h07Hkl. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 31\nB.  18 U.S.C. § 3504 Entitles the Defendants to Notice \nCongress has also provided a right to notice of electronic surveillance by statute. \nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3504(a), if a party in a proceeding before any court claims that \n“evidence is inadmissible” because “it is the primary product of an unlawful act or \nbecause it was obtained by the exploitation of any unlawful act” then the government \nmust “affirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged unlawful act.” The statute defines \n“unlawful act” as “the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device (as defined in \nsection 2510(5) of this title) in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States \nor any regulation or standard promulgated pursuant thereto.” Id. § 3504(b). \nThe government has recognized that 18 U.S.C. § 3504 requires “the affirmance or \ndenial of the fact of electronic surveillance, even if the government believes it was \nlawful.” David S. Kris & J. Douglas Wilson, National Security Investigations & \nProsecutions 2d at § 27:12 (emphasis in original). A “cognizable claim” for notice under \nthe statute “need be no more than a ‘mere assertion,’ provided that it is a positive \nstatement that illegal surveillance has taken place.” United States v. Apple, 915 F.2d 899, \n905 (4th Cir. 1990) (citing United States v. Tucker, 526 F.2d 279, 282 & n.4 (5th Cir. \n1976)). The party must make a prima facie showing that he was “aggrieved” by the \nsurveillance—i.e., “that he was a party to an intercepted communication, that the \ngovernment’s efforts were directed at him, or that the intercepted communications took \nplace on his premises.” Apple, 915 F.2d at 905. Because a defendant will have only \nlimited information about the government’s undisclosed surveillance, this initial showing \nneed not be complete; it must only have a “colorable basis.” Id. (citing United States v. \nPacella, 622 F.2d 640, 643 (2d Cir. 1980)). \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 31\nMr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev have made such a showing. The government has \ndescribed or disclosed numerous communications involving the defendants while \nrefusing to specify how it obtained them. See Section I. Those include the defendants’ \ninternational communications and their online activities, which could readily have been \nvacuumed up by the government’s dragnet collection of content and metadata under \nExecutive Order 12,333. See Section III.A. Separately, the government has \nacknowledged the domestic collection of internet metadata in bulk for at least ten years, \nup until 2011, under the NSA’s PR/TT program. See Section III.C. That program \ninvolved the interception of defendants’ metadata and/or communications, and was \ndirected at defendants (as well as many others), rendering them aggrieved under section \n3504. See generally United States v. Rodriguez, 968 F.2d 130, 136 (2d Cir. 1991) \n(“[W]hen the contents of a wire communication are captured or redirected in any way, an \ninterception occurs at that time.”). Finally, the government has acknowledged the NSA’s \nbulk collection of phone records over a period of years that spans its investigation in this \ncase. Through that program, the NSA obtained the call records of millions of individuals \nacross multiple phone companies, and it uses that aggregated data to track the calls of \nindividuals who are the subject of foreign-intelligence surveillance, like the defendants \nhere. See Section III.B. \nAccordingly, the government must provide notice of the surveillance methods \nused in this case and its purported legal authorities. See United States v. Alter, 482 F.2d \n1016, 1027 (9th Cir. 1973) (holding that the government’s response to a claim under \nsection 3504 was insufficient because it was conclusory, failed to clearly identify all \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:12-cr-00033-JLK   Document 653   Filed 10/20/14   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 31\ngovernmental agencies involved in the surveillance, failed to identify the date ranges of \nthe surveillance, and relied on vague hearsay recitations). \nC.  50 U.S.C. § 1845 Entitles the Defendants to Notice \nFinally, FISA expressly requires notice of surveillance conducted pursuant to the \nstatute’s pen-register and trap-and-trace provisions. 50 U.S.C. § 1845(c). The NSA’s \ninternet-metadata program was, for seven years, conducted under this authority. If the \ngovernment used data obtained via this program in its investigation of the defendants, it \nmust give notice so that they may seek to suppress any resulting evidence. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons above, Mr. Muhtorov and Mr. Jumaev respectfully request that \nthe Court issue an order compelling the government to provide notice of: (1) each \nsurveillance technique it used to obtain information about the defendants’ \ncommunications or activities in its investigation; (2) the timing or duration of that \nsurveillance; (3) the legal authority relied upon; and (4) the evidence obtained or derived \nfrom that surveillance. \nDated this 20th day of October 2014.
