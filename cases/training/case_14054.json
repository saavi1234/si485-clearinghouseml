Torruella, Appellate Judge: On March 3, 2015, the parties filed a Joint Motion for a Preliminary Fairness Hearing in the district court. On March 5, 2015, the district court granted the motion and scheduled a preliminary fairness hearing for April 9, 2015. On March 16, the parties filed a joint motion to remand this case to the district court for the purpose of holding preliminary and final settlement fairness hearings. We regard the district court's intention to schedule a fairness hearing as a sufficient statement that it believes that the parties' Joint Motion for a Preliminary Fairness Hearing \"raises a substantial issue.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1(a)(3); see also Fed. R. App. P. 12.1(b). In view of the district court's March 5, 2015, order embodying that view, the case is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with that order. Jurisdiction is retained. Once the district court concludes its proceedings, then the parties should proceed in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 42(b) or propose some other disposition. Appellants shall file a status report every 60 days. (Paine, Matthew) (Entered: 04/02/2015)"

As an initial matter, the requests for intervention and to entirely quash the subpoena are DENIED. The request for Modification of the subpoena, however, is GRANTED, but in part only, as follows. First, this order shall apply to all three state correctional institutions which are the subject of the subpoena. Second, Plaintiffs and MDOC shall forthwith enter into a Protective Order substantially if not entirely similar to the protective order which applies to Plaintiffs and Defendants. Third, by May 9, 2013, and subject to the further provisos below, MDOC shall produce the public policies and procedures to Plaintiffs. Fourth, by May 16, 2013, MDOC shall produce to Plaintiffs the private policies, i.e., staff access only policies, and the post orders to Plaintiffs, subject to the further provisos below. Fifth, notwithstanding the protective order, MDOC may redact from the private policies and post orders such material as falls entirely outside the subject matter of Schedule A of the subpoena, on the further condition, however, that the general subject matter of the redacted portions shall be described to Plaintiffs by MDOC; Plaintiffs are free to challenge those redactions at a later date.. Sixth, MDOC need only produce current policies and procedures (whether public or private) and post orders of an institution if those policies, procedures and/or post orders, as applicable, are accompanied by an affidavit which indicates that they have not materially changed since September of 2008. So ordered. (Neiman, Kenneth) (Entered: 05/02/2013)"

Neiman: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered denying 104 Defendants' Motion to Amend Answer so as to add an affirmative defense regarding the named plaintiff's and/or members of the class's failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. as assertedly required by 42 U.S.C. section 1997e(a), the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"). Even putting aside Plaintiffs' argument that the PLRA does not apply here (which argument has merit), the court finds that Defendants' motion -- which comes nearly two years after Defendants filed their original answer to the complaint, almost eighteen months after the commencement of discovery, and a matter of weeks before the expiration of fact discovery on liability (a deadline extended at Defendants' request without any mention by them of this affirmative defense)-- was unduly delayed and will cause undue prejudice to Plaintiffs. In this regard, Defendants give no persuasive reason for delaying the invocation of such an affirmative defense, one with which they should have been familiar since the commencement of this action, and fail to fully appreciate the extensive additional discovery which would have to be undertaken were the motion allowed. At best, Defendants argue that, because of the relatively recent certification of the class, this defense is \"only now applicable to the members of the class.\" As Plaintiffs assert, this argument has no weight; the complaint was filed as a class action and contained class allegations, affirmative defenses were \"applicable\" to class members all along, and Defendants understood this when they filed their answer and included other affirmative defenses explicitly directed toward the \"alleged class.\" (Neiman, Kenneth) (Entered: 09/16/2013)"

Neiman: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered granting in part and denying in part 120 Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Witnesses and Documents Identified in Disclosures Made After the Close of Discovery, as follows. The motion is ALLOWED without objection with regard to witness DeCou. The motion is also ALLOWED with regard to the following witnesses: Bernardi-Agnes, Connor, Harriman, Lyman, Pfister and Pratt. In so ruling, the court finds first that Defendants' justification for the late disclosure is unconvincing; all of these individuals were known to Defendants for quite some time as having information with regard to this action but nonetheless were not disclosed. Second, the fact that some of their names may have appeared in the thousands of pages of documents does not amount to appropriate disclosures; indeed, Defendants themselves indicate that several of these witnesses' names may have appeared only once or twice, others not at all, and yet others a bit more often but with no explanation of the context of those occasions. (See Opposition (Document No. 135) at pages 3 through 5.) Third, Defendants' assertion that the broad-based disclosures in their October 5, 2012 Supplemental Automatic Disclosures would suffice is particularly unpersuasive; as Plaintiffs argue, this approach to disclosure would not only violate Rule 26(a)(1) but swallow it whole. Fourth, Defendants' argument to the contrary, these late disclosures would in fact adversely affect not only Plaintiffs' ability to complete appropriate discovery but would inappropriately extend the court's management of this litigation. And fifth, Defendants' argument that most of these witnesses \"are likely of only tangential import to this case\" (Defendants' Opposition at page 1) actually mitigates against, not for, their being included as witnesses, to wit, there is apparently less need for the precluded evidence than Defendants might otherwise argue. The motion, however, is DENIED with regard to witnesses Blair, Laurens, Morales, but only in their capacities as former inmates at the facility. Given some of Plaintiffs' deposition testimony, Defendants should have the opportunity to present these three individuals as witnesses, subject to Defendants paying the costs of any depositions which Plaintiffs may wish to take of them. The motion is also DENIED with respect to certain HCCC Policies and Procedures, it appearing to the court that these documents are either the same as or closely related to documents previously produced by Defendants. In contrast, the motion is ALLOWED with regard to audits by the American Correctional Association and the Department of Correction prior to 2008, the court concluding that these documents ought to have been revealed earlier insofar as they may have influenced the procedures utilized by Defendants and at issue in this case. In so ruling, the court acknowledges that Plaintiffs have acceded to yet other late disclosures which are not at issue. So ordered. (Neiman, Kenneth) (Entered: 12/09/2013)"

Defendants shall fully respond to Request No. 8 with regard to all incident reports requested to the extent not yet produced. With regard to Request No 9, Defendants shall provide, in addition to videos already produced, access to all videos (in which a female corrections officer held the video camera) for every third month beginning September of 2008 through the relevant three-and-one-half tear time period. In so ruling, the court finds that the scope of discovery is broader than what Defendants profess and that, for the various reasons set forth in Plaintiffs' motion, the discovery is potentially relevant to the claims of the putative class. The court also concludes that any privacy interests of the videotaped inmates would be more than adequately protected by the existing protective order. In limiting the discovery to every third month, however, the court recognizes the burdens placed on Defendants while ensuring that an appropriate sample of potential evidence is produced. Defendants shall produce the discovery no later than October 26, 2012. So ordered. (Neiman, Kenneth) (Entered: 10/04/2012)"

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought money damages, alleging that the Sheriff's Department violated their Fourth Amendment rights by allowing male officers to be present for and videotape non-emergency strip searches.</p><p>Following discovery and arguments on the specifics of the Sheriff Department's policies with regards to non-emergency strip searches, on May 23, 2013 the District Court (Judge Michael A. Ponsor) granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The class consisted of 178 current and former WCC inmates who were videotaped by male correctional officers during strip searches. The Sheriff's Department appealed, but the First Circuit denied hearing the appeal.</p><p>On August 26, 2014, Judge Ponsor granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, finding that the mere presence of male corrections officer during non-emergency strip searches violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. Further proceedings were deemed necessary to determine the issue of liability and potential monetary and equitable relief. The Sheriff's Department appealed the order to the First Circuit. While that ruling was pending on appeal, the court stayed further proceedings on Oct. 3, 2014. </p><p>Meanwhile, the parties reached a settlement in March 2015: the state (not the county) agreed to pay $675,000.  $475,000 was allocated to the plaintiffs' attorneys for fees and $22,000 for costs; $20,000 to the lead plaintiff; $2,000 each to four plaintiffs who were deposed, and the remaining class members were set to receive at least $850, and more depending on the claiming rate.  In addition, defendants agreed to change their policy to prohibit male officers from holding the video camera during strip searches except in exigent circumstances, as defined in the Prison Rape Elimination Act regulation, which defined \"exigent circumstances\" to be \"any set of temporary and unforeseen circumstances that require immediate action in order to combat a threat to the security or institutional order of a facility.\" PREA Standards ยง 115.5. The defendants were to provide plaintiffs with statistics, a copy of the video of the full movie and strip search and any reports or materials documenting the need for the male videotaping up until June 30, 2016.</p><p>On April 2, 2015, the First Circuit remanded the case back to the district court in response to the parties' joint motion requesting the remand for purposes of holding a settlement fairness hearing. </p><p>A preliminary fairness hearing was held on April 9, 2015, and Judge Ponsor agreed to proceed to a final fairness hearing. On September 10, 2015 the court found the settlement fair and reasonable, and approved it; it also granted $475,000 in attorneys' fees and $22,000 in costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. The First Circuit terminated the appeal on Sept. 16, 2015 in response to the parties voluntarily dismissing the appeal.</p><p>The case is now closed.</p>",

Defendants shall fully\nrespond to Request No. 8 with regard to all incident reports requested to the extent not\nyet produced. With regard to Request No 9, Defendants shall provide, in addition to\nvideos already produced, access to all videos (in which a female corrections officer\nheld the video camera) for every third month beginning September of 2008 through the\nrelevant threeโandโoneโhalf tear time period. In so ruling, the court finds that the\nscope of discovery is broader than what Defendants profess and that, for the various\nreasons set forth in Plaintiffs' motion, the discovery is potentially relevant to the claims\nof the putative class. The court also concludes that any privacy interests of the\nvideotaped inmates would be more than adequately protected by the existing protective\norder. In limiting the discovery to every third month, however, the court recognizes the\nburdens placed on Defendants while ensuring that an appropriate sample of potential\nevidence is produced. Defendants shall produce the discovery no later than October\n26, 2012. So ordered.

Even putting aside Plaintiffs' argument that\nthe PLRA does not apply here (which argument has merit), the court finds that\nDefendants' motion โโ which comes nearly two years after Defendants filed their\noriginal answer to the complaint, almost eighteen months after the commencement of\ndiscovery, and a matter of weeks before the expiration of fact discovery on liability (a\n\nCase: 3:11-cv-30223   As of: 01/18/2018 06:56 PM EST   12 of 23\ndeadline extended at Defendants' request without any mention by them of this\naffirmative defense)โโ was unduly delayed and will cause undue prejudice to\nPlaintiffs. In this regard, Defendants give no persuasive reason for delaying the\ninvocation of such an affirmative defense, one with which they should have been\nfamiliar since the commencement of this action, and fail to fully appreciate the\nextensive additional discovery which would have to be undertaken were the motion\nallowed. At best, Defendants argue that, because of the relatively recent certification of\nthe class, this defense is \"only now applicable to the members of the class.\" As\nPlaintiffs assert, this argument has no weight; the complaint was filed as a class action\nand contained class allegations, affirmative defenses were \"applicable\" to class\nmembers all along, and Defendants understood this when they filed their answer and\nincluded other affirmative defenses explicitly directed toward the \"alleged class.\"\n(Neiman, Kenneth) (Entered: 09/16/2013)\n09/19/2013 109  Assented to MOTION to Take Deposition from Rebecca Bermudez a Person Confined\nin Prison by Michael J.

(Finn, Mary).\n(Entered: 12/06/2013)\n12/06/2013 146  REPLY to Response to 120 MOTION to Strike witnesses and documents identified in\ndisclosures made after the close of discovery filed by Debra Baggett. (Milton, David)\n(Entered: 12/06/2013)\n12/09/2013 147  Magistrate Judge Kenneth P. Neiman: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered granting in\npart and denying in part 120 Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Witnesses and Documents\nIdentified in Disclosures Made After the Close of Discovery, as follows. The motion is\nALLOWED without objection with regard to witness DeCou. The motion is also\nALLOWED with regard to the following witnesses: BernardiโAgnes, Connor,\nHarriman, Lyman, Pfister and Pratt. In so ruling, the court finds first that Defendants'\njustification for the late disclosure is unconvincing; all of these individuals were\nknown to Defendants for quite some time as having information with regard to this\naction but nonetheless were not disclosed. Second, the fact that some of their names\nmay have appeared in the thousands of pages of documents does not amount to\nappropriate disclosures; indeed, Defendants themselves indicate that several of these\nwitnesses' names may have appeared only once or twice, others not at all, and yet\nothers a bit more often but with no explanation of the context of those occasions. (See\nOpposition (Document No. 135) at pages 3 through 5.) Third, Defendants' assertion\nthat the broadโbased disclosures in their October 5, 2012 Supplemental Automatic\n\nCase: 3:11-cv-30223   As of: 01/18/2018 06:56 PM EST   15 of 23\nDisclosures would suffice is particularly unpersuasive; as Plaintiffs argue, this\napproach to disclosure would not only violate Rule 26(a)(1) but swallow it whole.\nFourth, Defendants' argument to the contrary, these late disclosures would in fact\nadversely affect not only Plaintiffs' ability to complete appropriate discovery but\nwould inappropriately extend the court's management of this litigation. And fifth,\nDefendants' argument that most of these witnesses \"are likely of only tangential import\nto this case\" (Defendants' Opposition at page 1) actually mitigates against, not for,\ntheir being included as witnesses, to wit, there is apparently less need for the precluded\nevidence than Defendants might otherwise argue. The motion, however, is DENIED\nwith regard to witnesses Blair, Laurens, Morales, but only in their capacities as former\ninmates at the facility. Given some of Plaintiffs' deposition testimony, Defendants\nshould have the opportunity to present these three individuals as witnesses, subject to\nDefendants paying the costs of any depositions which Plaintiffs may wish to take of\nthem. The motion is also DENIED with respect to certain HCCC Policies and\nProcedures, it appearing to the court that these documents are either the same as or\nclosely related to documents previously produced by Defendants. In contrast, the\nmotion is ALLOWED with regard to audits by the American Correctional Association\nand the Department of Correction prior to 2008, the court concluding that these\ndocuments ought to have been revealed earlier insofar as they may have influenced the\nprocedures utilized by Defendants and at issue in this case. In so ruling, the court\nacknowledges that Plaintiffs have acceded to yet other late disclosures which are not at\nissue. So ordered. (Neiman, Kenneth) (Entered: 12/09/2013)\n12/11/2013 148  Magistrate Judge Kenneth P. Neiman: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered granting 117\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel. Although Defendants did not waive their right to object\nto the disclosure, the court concludes, after reviewing the seven emails in question,\nthat the documents are not protected by either an attorneyโclient privilege or the\nworkโproduct doctrine and, further, are not evidence related to an expert under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 26(b)(4)(D). Mr. Milosovich was identified by Defendants as a fact witness,\nwas deposed in that capacity without objection, and the emails are potentially relevant\nto that testimony, even though Defendants now assert that the emails are of little\nimport to this case. (See Defendants' Opposition (Document No. 134) at page 1.) The\ndocuments will remain under seal by the court (as discovery materials) but shall be\nforthwith provided to Plaintiffs by Defendants. So ordered.

The parties to this action, class representative Debra Baggett, individually and on \nbehalf of the Class (โPlaintiffsโ), and Michael J. Ashe, Jr., and Patricia Murphy, in their individual \ncapacities (โDefendantsโ), by counsel, have entered into this Settlement Agreement, which they \nsubmit to the Court for approval. The Agreement requires Defendants to change their policy to \nprohibit male correctional officers from holding the camera during the strip searches of female \ninmates  except  in  exigent  circumstances.  The  Agreement  provides  that  Defendants  will  settle \nPlaintiffsโ claims for $675,000, to be allocated as follows, subject to the approval of the Court: Class \nMembers will receive a total of $178,000 (the โClass Member Poolโ), which will be divided equally \namong participating class members after payment of a $20,000 bonus to the class representative and \n$2,000 bonuses to each of the four class members who had their depositions taken. Under this \nAgreement, participating class members will receive one payment each no matter how many times \nthey were videotaped by a male officer during the class period. Plaintiffsโ counsel will receive a total \nof $497,000, of which $475,000 represents attorneyโs fees and $22,000 represents costs.  This is a \nsettlement of a disputed claim.  Defendants deny any wrongdoing on their own parts or on the part \nof their staff.   \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 2 of 20\nII.   BACKGROUND \n2.  Class representative Debra Baggett is a former  inmate at the Western Massachusetts \nRegional Womenโs Correctional Center (โWCCโ) in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The WCC is part of \nthe Hampden County Sheriffโs Department (โHCSDโ).  \n3.  Defendant Michael J. Ashe, Jr., is the Sheriff of Hampden County. \n4.  Defendant Patricia Murphy is the Assistant Superintendent in charge of the WCC. \n5.  Plaintiff filed this class action lawsuit for damages on September 15, 2011, alleging, \ninter alia, that Defendantsโ policy permitting male correctional officers at the WCC to videotape \nfemale  inmates being strip searched in non-emergency situations violated the Fourth Amendment. \n6.  On May 23, 2013, the Court certified this case as a class action pursuant to Rule \n23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The class is defined as โAll women strip searched \nat  the  Western  Massachusetts  Regional  Womenโs  Correctional  Center  while  a  male  officer \nvideotaped the strip search, since September 15, 2008.โ The parties have identified 176 women who \nmeet this definition (โClass Membersโ). Class membership was determined by reviewing incident \nreports about moves to the Segregation Unit at the WCC and videotapes of these moves and \nattendant strip searches.  \n7.  By Memorandum and Order dated August 26, 2014, the Court granted Plaintiffsโ \nMotion  for  Summary  Judgment.  The  Court  ruled  that  Defendantsโ  policy  permitting  male \ncorrectional officers to videotape female inmates during strip searches in non-emergency situations \nviolated Class Membersโ constitutional rights, and that Defendants were liable to class members for \nthese violations. \n8.  Defendants deny any wrongdoing or unlawful conduct on their own part or on the \npart of their employees or staff. Defendants deny that any male officers ever watched any portion of \nthe strip search of a female inmate. They reassert that any cross-gender viewing was expressly \nforbidden by policy, procedure, and training, that there was a Supervisor present at every strip search \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 3 of 20\nto ensure compliance with policy, procedure, and training, and that neither Defendants nor their \nstaff  ever  received  a  written  grievance  about  the  challenged  practice.  Plaintiffs  dispute  these \nassertions. On September 17, 2014, Defendants filed a notice of appeal of the Courtโs decision to \nthe First Circuit Court of Appeals.  \n9.  The parties reached this Agreement before any briefs were filed in the First Circuit. \n10.  The  parties  reached  this  Agreement  after  engaging  in  armโs-length  settlement \nnegotiations, including a mediation session and multiple follow-up discussions with the Honorable \nPatrick King, Settlement Counsel at the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Following an in-person \nsession with Judge King on November 4, 2014, the parties continued negotiations for more than a \nmonth  via  telephone  and  email  with  Judge  King  serving  as  an  intermediary.  Judge  King \nrecommended the Total Settlement Amount to the parties and he endorsed the manner in which \nthis amount is divided among Class Members, the named Plaintiff, the Class Member deponents, \nand attorneyโs fees and costs. \n11.  Plaintiffsโ counsel conducted a thorough examination and investigation of the facts \nand law relating to this litigation. The parties engaged in comprehensive discovery for almost two \nyears. Discovery included 23 depositions including those of the named Plaintiff and the Defendants; \nClass Members and other former WCC  inmates who are not class members; numerous Hampden \nCounty Sheriffโs Department correctional officers, supervisors, and administrators; and an outside \nconsultant to the Sheriffโs Department. The parties engaged in extensive document discovery, \nincluding the production by Defendants of more than 15,000 pages of documents. Pursuant to \nsubpoena, nonparties the Massachusetts Department of Correction (โDOCโ) and the Middlesex \nCounty Sheriffโs Department produced more than 1,000 pages in total. Defendants produced more \nthan 800 videos of moves to Segregation and accompanying strip searches, including 274 videos of \nmoves and strip searches in which a male correctional officer held the video camera during the strip \nsearch. Plaintiffs and Defendants both served expert reports from correctional professionals. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 4 of 20\n12.  The parties have concluded that settlement is desirable in order to avoid the time, \nexpense, and inherent risks and uncertainties of continuing this litigation, and in order to finally and \ncompletely resolve all pending claims of the Plaintiff and Class Members relating to the alleged \nconduct involved in this lawsuit.  This Settlement Agreement represents a compromise of a disputed \nclaim.  Defendants  deny  any  liability,  wrongdoing,  and/or  malfeasance  on  the  part  of  the \nDefendants, the Commonwealth, and/or their employees or staff.. \n13.  The parties believe that this Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable and adequate. \nPlaintiffsโ counsel believes it is in the best interests of Plaintiff and Class Members. \n14.  This  Settlement  Agreement  is  made  and  entered  into,  through  counsel,  by \nDefendants Michael J. Ashe, Jr., and Patricia Murphy, in their individual capacities, and Plaintiff \nDebra  Baggett,  individually  and  on  behalf  of  all  Class  Members.  As  described  below,  the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, through counsel, also assumes obligations under this Agreement \nand intends to be bound by this Agreement. \n  15.  All parties and Class Members are bound by this Settlement Agreement  \n.III.   REQUIRED PAYMENTS AND POLICY CHANGES \n  16.  On behalf of both Defendants, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will pay the \nsum of Six Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($675,000.00) to settle all claims brought by \nPlaintiffs in this action, including claims for attorneyโs fees and costs. The $675,000 is referred to as \nthe โTotal Settlement Amount.โ The Total Settlement Amount represents the sum of the amount \npaid to Class Members, which is $178,000, and the amount paid to Plaintiffsโ counsel as attorneysโ \nfees and reimbursement for costs (โAttorneyโs Fees and Costsโ), which is $497,000. \n17.  All payments hereunder will be made by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as \ndetailed in this Agreement. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 5 of 20\n18.   All parties understand that this agreement will require the approval of the Court. All \nparties will ask the Court to approve the terms of this Settlement Agreement.  \n  19.   Defendants will amend the WCC policy on inmate movement to prohibit male \nofficers from holding the video camera during strip searches except in exigent circumstances. The \nrestriction on male officersโ videotaping strip searches shall be the same restriction as applies in \nDefendantsโ policies to male officersโ conducting strip searches. The restriction in both cases shall \nmirror the restriction on cross-gender strip searches and cross-gender visual body cavity searches in \nthe final standards of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (โPREAโ), which prohibit such searches \nexcept in exigent circumstances. PREA Standards ยง 115.15. Defendantsโ policies shall adopt the \nPREA standardsโ definition of โexigent circumstances,โ which are โany set of temporary and \nunforeseen circumstances that require immediate action in order to combat a threat to the security \nor institutional order of a facility.โ PREA Standards ยง 115.5.  Within thirty (30) days of the Courtโs \ngranting preliminary approval of the settlement, Defendants shall provide Plaintiffsโ counsel with an \nunsigned final draft of all amended policy documents containing the changes required under this \nAgreement. Defendants shall make the amended policies effective no later than thirty (30) days after \nthe Courtโs final approval of the settlement, by which time they shall provide Plaintiffsโ counsel with \ncopies of the signed, effective version of all amended policy documents.   \n  20.  The above restrictions shall be included in the following places in Defendantsโ \nwritten policies and procedures (โP&Pโsโ). \n(a) In P&P 3.1.7 (โInmate Movementโ), the paragraph of the Background section \ncurrently requiring female officers to videotape strip searches โunless impracticable to do \nsoโ shall be amended to read: โThe videotaping of the strip search portion of a compliant or \nnoncompliant security escort is assigned to female staff except in exigent circumstances. The \nterm โexigent circumstancesโ is defined below, and is intended to prohibit supervisors from \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 6 of 20\nassigning male officers to videotape the strip search portion of a security escort except in \ncircumstances that would warrant assigning  male staff to be one of the primary staff \nconducting a strip search. (See 3.1.11 Strip Searches).โ \n(b) In P&P 3.1.7, the Definitions section shall include the following definition of \nexigent circumstances: โExigent circumstances: Any set of temporary and unforeseen \ncircumstances that require immediate action in order to combat a threat to the security or \ninstitutional order of a facility.โ \n(c) In P&P 3.1.7, Section D, โCompliant Security Escorts,โ ยถ 2(c) shall be amended \nto read: โAssigned staff video records the entire escort. Except in exigent circumstances, the \nassigned staff who videotapes the strip search portion of the escort shall be a female.โ    \n(d) In P&P 3.1.7, Section D, ยถ 34 shall be amended to read: โA female staff informs \nthe inmate and the other staff that she will conduct a strip search. (See 3.1.11 Inmate \nSearches.) At this time, the camera operator, if male, shall hand the camera to a female staff \nor stop videotaping, except in exigent circumstances.โ \n  21.  Defendants shall provide statistics to Plaintiffsโ counsel regarding (a) the total \nnumber of moves to higher security and (b) total number of moves in which a male officer \nvideotaped during the strip search, as follows: (1) By January 30, 2016, Defendants shall provide \nsuch statistics for the period from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015; (2) by July 30, 2016, \nDefendants shall provide such statistics for the period from January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016. For \nany male-on-camera moves that occur during a reporting period, Defendants shall provide, along \nwith the statistics, a copy of the video of the full move and strip search and any reports or materials \ndocumenting the need for the male videotaping. \n  22.  The parties will request that the Court hold a hearing to determine whether to grant \npreliminary approval to the settlement. Before the hearing the parties will file a Joint Motion for \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 7 of 20\nPreliminary Approval of the Settlement Agreement. If preliminary approval is granted, the parties \nwill begin to implement the settlement. \n  23.  The parties will request that the Court hold the Final Fairness Hearing to decide \nwhether to grant final approval of the settlement on a date approximately 90 days after the Court \ngrants preliminary approval to the settlement.  \n24.  Before the date of the Final Fairness Hearing, the parties will file a Joint Motion for \nFinal Approval of the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffsโ counsel will file a separate motion asking the \nCourt to approve the attorneysโ fees and costs contemplated under this Agreement. Defendants \nagree not to oppose this motion provided that the total amount of fees and costs requested do not \nexceed $497,000.   \n  25.  If the Court grants final approval of the settlement, the Total Settlement Amount \nwill then be distributed pursuant to this Agreement and the orders of the Court.  \n  26.  Defendants shall inform Plaintiffsโ counsel when the Total Settlement Amount is \navailable for distribution.  Counsel recognize that the timing of funding for the Settlements and \nJudgments account is entirely at the discretion of the Legislature and is not necessarily predictable \nbefore the Legislature takes action. \n27.  All parties represent that they are authorized to enter into this Settlement Agreement \nand that they are able to perform each of its terms. Defendants specifically represent that the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts has agreed to pay the Total Settlement Amount and is bound to \ndo  so  under  the  terms  of  this  Settlement  Agreement  and  in  accordance  with  this  Settlement \nAgreement. \n  28.  The parties will cooperate with each other in good faith and will promptly take all \nnecessary steps to carry out and effectuate this Settlement Agreement. Defendants and their counsel \nagree to provide reasonable assistance to facilitate the administration of this settlement including \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 8 of 20\nproviding access to Class Member information in their possession necessary to send notice and to \nprocess  claims.  Defendants  and  their  counsel  further  agree  to  provide  access  to  all  data  and \ndocuments,  in  their  possession  including  any  videos,  necessary  to  resolve  any  appeals  from \nindividuals who file claims (โClaimantsโ) who dispute Plaintiffsโ counselโs determination that they \nare not Class Members. \nIV.  CLASS NOTICE AND CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION \n29.   Plaintiffsโ counselโs law firm, the Law Offices of Howard Friedman, P.C. (โLOHFโ), \nwill serve as Claims Administrator for this case. Plaintiffsโ counsel and LOHF will not receive \nadditional fees or other compensation (including reimbursement for additional costs) for this work \napart from the fees and costs provided for in ยถยถ 1 and 16, above. Plaintiffsโ counsel may include the \ntime spent and costs incurred performing this work in its application to the Court for attorneyโs fees \nand costs. LOHF has settled numerous prisoner class actions, and has worked closely with third-\nparty claims administration services. LOHF prepared and sent the initial Class Notice in this case. \nLOHF is knowledgeable about the systems and procedures necessary to ensure adequate notice to \nClass  Members  and  processing  of  claims.  LOHF  is  aware  of  the  time  and  effort  that  claims \nadministration of the settlement will entail; LOHF has the resources to administer this settlement. \nUpon preliminary approval by the Court, LOHF will provide the claims administration services \ndescribed in this Agreement. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts will distribute settlement checks \nto Class Members and provide the other services described below.  \n30.   LOHF will administer notice to Class Members in the manner prescribed by the \nCourt; shall accept and record all claim forms; shall send each denied Claimant notice that her claim \nhas been denied; shall resolve any appeals of claim denials and shall calculate the payment to Class \nMembers in accordance with this agreement. Plaintiffsโ counsel will provide Defendants and the \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 9 of 20\nCommonwealth with the class distribution list after final approval of the settlement, as described in \nยถ 51, below. \n31.  As soon as practicable, but in no case later than the date the Court holds a hearing \non preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, Defendantsโ counsel will provide Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel with the following information for all Class Members: (a) full name; (b) known aliases; (c) \nSocial  Security  Number,  (d)  date  of  birth;  (e)  last  known  address(es),  and,  if  known,  phone \nnumber(s); and (f) the date of the Class Memberโs release from HCSD custody. The information \ndescribed  in  (a)  through  (f)  of  this  paragraph,  which  shall  be  known  as  the  โClass  Member \nInformation,โ  shall  be  provided  electronically  in  Microsoft  Excel  format.  The  โlast  known \naddress(es)โ  shall  mean  the  most  recent  address(es)  known  to  the  Hampden  County  Sheriffโs \nDepartment. โKnown to the Hamden County Sheriffโs Departmentโ means known to any division \nof the HCSD, including but not limited to the WCC, the Western Massachusetts Correctional \nAlcohol Center (โWMCACโ), and the Community Safety Center. If any individual is in the custody \nof any Hampden County Sheriffโs Department or Massachusetts Department of Correction facility \nat the time the Class Member Information is provided, Defendants shall provide the name and \naddress of the facility in addition to such individualโs last known outside address(es).  \n32.  LOHF will send a Notice of Class Action and Proposed Settlement (โNoticeโ), and a \nSettlement Claim Form (collectively, the โNotice Packetโ), by first-class mail postage prepaid to all \nClass Members at their last known addresses within ten (10) days of receipt of the Class Member \nInformation  from  Defendants,  or  the  date  the  Court  preliminarily  approves  the  settlement, \nwhichever is later. For any Class Members who have contacted LOHF directly to provide an \naddress, LOHF will also send the Notice Packet to this address, if it is known to be more recent \nthan the address provided by Defendants; if it is unknown which address is more recent, LOHF will \nsend the Notice Packet to both addresses. If any mail is returned by the post office with notice of a \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 10 of 20\nmore current address, LOHF will resend the Notice Packet to the newer address.  If any mail is \nreturned by the post office as undeliverable without notice of a more current address, LOHF will \nuse an online skip trace service to identify potentially current addresses of Class Members. LOHF \nwill also attempt to reach class members via social media and email. LOHF may, but is not required \nto, make any further efforts to send mail directly to Class Members or otherwise contact Class \nMembers individually.  \nIf any Class Member contacts Defendants or their representatives with updated contact \ninformation, Defendants will, to the best of their ability,  provide this information to LOHF and will \ntell the Class Member to contact LOHF.  Specifically, to comply with the terms of this paragraph, \nDefendants will provide a notice to the switchboard at every HCSD facility that handles female \ninmates (i.e. the WCC, WMCAC, the Day Reporting Center, After-Incarceration Support Services, \nand the HCSDโs main switchboard), which notice will include a log sheet and instructions for \nfielding such calls. \n  33.   The Notice will include the terms of the settlement including the Class Memberโs \nrights to contest the settlement. The Notice will explain the settlement terms and answer anticipated \nquestions. The Notice will provide the date and time of the Final Fairness Hearing. The proposed \nNotice mailed to Class Members is attached as Exhibit A.  \n34.   The Claim Form requests the Class Memberโs contact information and instructions \nfor check delivery, and requires completion of a substitute W-9 Form. The proposed Claim Form is \nattached as Exhibit B. \n  35.  At the time they provide Plaintiffsโ counsel with Class Member Information, \nDefendants shall identify each Class Member who is then in the custody of the Hampden County \nSheriffโs Department, whether in the WCC, WMCAC, or another HCSD facility, and shall hand \ndeliver to each such Class Member a Notice Packet. Approximately 30 days before the deadline for \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 11 of 20\nsubmitting claims, Defendants shall again identify all Class Members in HCSD custody at that time, \nand shall hand deliver a Notice Packet to any Class Member not identified the first time.  \n  36.  Defendants shall provide a copy of a โGeneric Noticeโ and โGeneric Claim Formโ โ \ndesigned for individuals whom the parties have not already determined to be Class Members โ to \nany female inmate at either facility upon request. The Generic Notice and Generic Claim Form are \nattached as Exhibit C and Exhibit D, respectively. Defendants and their employees shall provide the \nname, address, and phone number of the LOHF in response to any inquiries about the settlement or \nthe claims procedure, but Defendants shall have no further obligation to respond to any such \ninquiries. \n  37.  The parties shall issue a joint press release informing the public of the settlement. \nThe press release shall be sent to local news organizations, including the Springfield Republican, Valley \nAdvocate, Daily Hampshire Gazette, Greenfield Recorder, the Associated Press, and several Western \nMassachusetts radio and TV stations within 10 days of preliminary approval. The press release is \nattached as Exhibit E. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts will not join in this press release. Class \ncounsel shall place legal notice by publication for two days in the Springfield Republican within 10 days \nof preliminary approval. The legal notice is attached as Exhibit F. The Notice, Claim Form and \nother information about the lawsuit will also be available on LOHFโs website, www.civil-rights-\nlaw.com. Notice as set forth in this paragraph shall be deemed sufficient legal notice to Class \nMembers who did not receive individual notice. \n38.  To  claim  a  share  of  the  settlement,  a  Class  Member  must  submit  a  valid  and \ncomplete Claim Form and substitute W-9 form that are received no later than sixty (60) days after \nthe date that Notice is first mailed to Class Members, or as allowed by the Court. This deadline is \nthe โClaims Deadline.โ \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 12 of 20\n39.  Claim  Forms  received  by  LOHF  after  the  Claims  Deadline  will  be  denied  as \nuntimely, except as allowed by the Court.  \n40.   To object to the proposed settlement, a Class Member must submit a written notice \nof the objection to LOHF that is received no later than sixty (60) days after the date that Notice is \nfirst mailed to Class Members. An objector who has submitted a timely written notice of objection \nmay also appear in person or through counsel at the Final Fairness Hearing. Plaintiffsโ counsel will \nfile all written objections with the Court no less than ten (10) days before the Final Fairness Hearing. \nThe objecting Class Member must also submit a Claim Form if she wishes to be eligible to share in \nthe settlement should it be approved despite her objection or any other objections. \n41.  LOHF will review each Claim Form to determine that a Class Member Claimant \nqualifies to be a Participating Class Member by confirming (a) that the completed Claim Form is \ntimely and valid, (b) that the information on the Claim Form is consistent with the Class Member \nInformation provided by Defendants, and (c) that the form is completely filled out and signed and is \naccompanied by a completed substitute W-9 form. If LOHF determines that an individual not on \nthe Class List and who submits a Claim Form is a Class Member, LOHF will send her a notice of \napproval, provided that the Claim Form meets requirements (a) and (c). LOHF will provide a copy \nof the notice of approval to Defendantsโ counsel.  \n42.  LOHF may, in its discretion, waive a technical defect in a completed Claim Form to \nachieve substantial justice.  \n43.   If the Claimant is determined not to be a Participating Class Member, LOHF will \nsend a Notice of Claim Denial to the Claimant. Where possible, LOHF shall provide the reason for \nthe denial. LOHF will provide a copy of the notice of denial to Defendantsโ counsel. \n44.  To object to LOHFโs determination that she is not a Class Member, a Claimant must \nsend a written appeal to LOHF received no later than fourteen (14) days after the date of the mailing \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 13 of 20\nof the Notice of Claim Denial. The Claimant must include a written statement of the basis for \nassertion that she is a Class Member. LOHF will investigate the claim and, after consulting with \ndefense counsel, make a determination on each appeal within seven (7) days. LOHF will inform the \nClaimant in writing of its determination, and provide a copy to defense counsel. \n45.   A Claimant may appeal to the Court LOHFโs final decision denying a claim. In order \nto do so, a Claimant must write a letter addressed to LOHF indicating her wish to appeal to the \nCourt that is received no more than fourteen (14) days after the date of the mailing of the final \ndecision denying her Claim. Plaintiffsโ counsel will present all such appeals, along with supporting \nmaterials and other materials relevant to the determination, to the Court when they are received. \nV.  SUBMISSION FOR PAYMENT  \n  46.    Within ten (10) days after approval of the settlement at the Final Fairness Hearing, or \nreceipt of the Distribution List and W-9 Forms from LOHF, whichever is later, defense counsel will \nsubmit to the Comptrollerโs Office for payment an executed Settlement and Judgment Payment \nAuthorization Form, along with all required documentation.   Thereafter, Defendantsโ monetary \nobligation will be processed by the Commonwealth in accordance with the procedures set forth in \n815 CMR 5.00.  In the next available appropriations vehicle following submission of the aforesaid \ndocumentation to the Comptrollerโs Office, the Commonwealth will seek all necessary \nappropriations from the Massachusetts Legislature to meet its monetary obligation under this \nSettlement Agreement. \nVI.   EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYโS FEES \n47.   Plaintiffsโ counsel will ask the Court to approve payment of Plaintiffsโ attorneyโs fees \nin an amount of $475,000. In addition to attorneyโs fees, Plaintiffs will ask that the Court award \nlitigation expenses and class action administrative costs, which combined shall not exceed $22,000.   \nThese sums shall be incorporated into a single payment of $497,000 to be paid by one check \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 14 of 20\nmade payable to Plaintiffsโ counsel. Such check shall be mailed at the same time that distribution \npayments are first made to Participating Class Members under this Agreement. \nThe parties have engaged in exceptionally hard fought litigation for more than three years. \nPlaintiffsโ counsel represents that their attorneyโs fees as of the date of this Agreement exceed \n$475,000, and that Plaintiffsโ litigation costs as of the date of this Agreement exceed $22,000. \nPlaintiffsโ counsel significantly reduced the amount of fees and costs to which they would be entitled \nas a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and under the contingent fee agreement with the class \nrepresentative (which provided for reimbursement of all costs), in order to facilitate settlement. \nPlaintiffsโ counsel agreed to administer the settlement through their law firm as an additional \nmeasure to facilitate settlement by saving costs. Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiffsโ counsel \nreduced their demand for fees and costs during settlement negotiations. \nVII.   DISTRIBUTION TO CLASS MEMBERS \n  48.   In addition to her share as a Participating Class Member, class representative Debra \nBaggett will receive $20,000, subject to approval of the Court, to be paid from the Class Member \nPool to compensate her for bringing this case, the time she spent on this case and her loss of privacy \nas a result of serving as the named Plaintiff. Ms. Baggett has worked closely with Plaintiffsโ counsel \nsince late 2009 to change the policy at issue. Since the lawsuit was filed in September 2011, she has \nregularly provided counsel with information and has informed numerous Class Members and other \nwitnesses about the lawsuit. She attended pretrial hearings including the summary judgment hearing, \nand she attended a mediation in Worcester with then-Magistrate Judge Timothy S. Hillman. She \nanswered interrogatories and document requests, many of which were of a highly personal nature, in \npainstaking detail. She spent many hours preparing for her deposition, which lasted for the full \nseven hours permitted under the Federal Rules. Although she was released from the WCC in 2011, \nthe lawsuit has required her to continue to focus on painful memories of her time in jail. This \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 15 of 20\npayment will be issued at the same time as the distribution payments to Class Members.   \n  49.   In addition to their respective shares as Participating Class Members, the four Class \nMembers who gave depositions, will each receive $2,000 from the Class Member Pool, subject to \napproval by the Court, to compensate them for their service to the Class and their time and effort in \nbeing deposed by defense counsel. Their work in this regard included meeting with Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel to prepare for the deposition and reviewing the transcript of the deposition afterwards.  \n  50.   Participating Class Members will each receive an equal share of $150,000, which is \nthe amount of the Class Member Pool remaining after payment of the above service bonuses to the \nclass representative and the deponents. LOHF will calculate the amount of money due each Class \nMember by dividing $150,000 by the number of Participating Class Members. Each Participating \nClass Member will receive the same amount regardless of how many times she was strip searched \nwhile a male officer operated the video camera. \n  51.  LOHF will prepare a settlement distribution list in the form of a spreadsheet which \nwill contain the legal names, current addresses, mailing addresses (if different), and Social Security \nNumber or Taxpayer ID number of the Participating Class Members as well as the Distribution \nAmount for each Participating Class Member (โDistribution Spreadsheetโ). LOHF shall send the \nDistribution Spreadsheet, along with all of the Substitute W-9 forms submitted by Participating \nClass Members, to Defendantsโ counsel after the time for any appeals to LOHF of denied claims has \nexpired. \n  Any subsequent changes of address requests must be made in writing and must be signed by \nthe Participating Class Member and must include an amended W-9 Form. The Defendants will give \nnotice when the funds are appropriated and when the Comptrollerโs Office is no longer accepting \naddress changes (which should be no more than 30 days before the checks are distributed).At this \ntime, LOHF will send a final Distribution Spreadsheet that reflects all changes of address. \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 16 of 20\n52.  The Commonwealth will directly pay each Participating Class Member and Plaintiffsโ \nCounsel. The Commonwealth may deduct any outstanding child support or tax obligations or other \ndelinquent debts owed to the Commonwealth pursuant to M.G.L. Ch. 7A ยง 3, from a Participating \nClass Memberโs Distribution Amount if that Class Member owes any such obligations. The check \nstub or payment advice shall indicate the amount of any such deduction(s), the department for \nwhich the deduction(s) is (are) being made, and the contact information of such department(s). If a \nParticipating Class Member receives no money from the settlement as a result of such deduction(s), \nthen she shall receive a check stub or payment advice with the foregoing information concerning the \ndeductions. \n53.   The Commonwealth will be responsible for all tax withholding and reporting as \nrequired by law.  Participating Class Members are responsible for payment of any additional taxes \nand other withholdings for which they are legally responsible that may become due on settlement \nproceeds, and hold Defendants, and their counsel harmless from any and all claims for said taxes \nand withholdings thereon.  \n54.  Each Participating Class Memberโs check will be made payable only in her name or \nin the name of a deceased Class Memberโs estate, provided the duly appointed estate representative \nhas complied with ยถ 61 and completed a W-9 Form, and subject to the provisions of Paragraph 52. \nIf the Class Memberโs address is listed on the Distribution List as โClass Member c/o [another \nindividual]โ, the Commonwealth shall ensure that the Class Memberโs check is not made payable to \nthe โClass Member c/o [such individual].โ The check will contain a memo or other indication that it \nis payment for the โHampden County class action settlement,โ to help Class Members identify the \npurpose of the check. The check will be mailed to the Participating Class Member at the legal \naddress indicated on the Claim Form or as updated as provided in Paragraph 51, above.

If  any  Class  Member  contacts  the \nCommonwealth with new contact information, the Commonwealth will provide this information to \nLOHF and tell the Class Member to contact LOHF.  \n55.  If a Participating Class Member is confined in a prison, hospital, or other institution \nand has provided the address of such institution for payment, the settlement check will be sent to \nthat address unless the Participating Class Member makes other acceptable arrangements in writing \nwith LOHF. \nVIII.   POST-DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION \n  56.   The Commonwealth will prepare all 1099s, and any other tax forms relating to the \nsettlement that are required by law, for all Participating Class Members during the next regular tax-\nform processing period following the distribution. \n57.  Within 60 days of mailing settlement checks to Class Members, the Commonwealth \nwill  provide  to  LOHF  a  settlement  distribution  report  accounting  for  the  distribution  of  the \nSettlement Proceeds, including attorneyโs fees and expenses. The report shall contain the following \ninformation for each Participating Class Member: full name; taxpayer identification number; vendor \ncustomer code; check number; check issue date; check clear date; amount of payment; amount of \ninterception by the Commonwealth, if any; and address to which the check was sent. \n58.  One year after the original date of the first distribution, the Commonwealth will \nprovide a final report accounting for the distribution of the Settlement Proceeds, upon written \nrequest, which shall include the information described in ยถ 57.  \n  59.   Class Members will be informed in the Claim Form that all settlement checks must \nbe cashed within sixty days.  \n  60.   Checks not presented for payment within one year from the original date of issue \nwill be subject to M.G.L. c. 29, ยง 32. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 242-1   Filed 03/31/15   Page 18 of 20\nIX.   DECEASED CLASS MEMBERS \n  61.   If a Class Member is deceased, an authorized representative may file a Settlement \nClaim Form on behalf of the estate. However, the representative must provide to LOHF \ndocumentation that an estate has been established in accordance with the law and that he or she is \nthe duly appointed representative. \nX.   RELEASE AND DISMISSAL \n \n \n  62.   In consideration of payment of the Settlement Proceeds, and the Defendantsโ other \nundertakings hereunder, and for other good and sufficient consideration, the receipt and sufficiency \nof which is hereby acknowledged, Plaintiffs, including those Class Members who do not file claims, \nhereby remise, release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge Defendants Michael J.

Nos. 156 & 171)\nAugust 26, 2014\nPONSOR, U.S.D.J.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff Debra Baggett represents a class of 178\nformer and current inmates of the Western Regional\nWomenโs Correctional Center, who have brought suit\nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against Defendants Michael Ashe,\nJr., Hampden County Sheriff, and Patricia Murphy,\nAssistant Superintendent.1  Plaintiff claims that\nDefendantsโ policy of permitting male officers to\nvideotape female inmates being strip-searched upon\ntransfer to the segregation unit violated the Fourth\nAmendment.\n1\n   Though this case is a class action, the court, for\nsimplicityโs sake, refers to Plaintiff in the singular\nthroughout this memorandum. \n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 2 of 38\nDefendants have moved for summary judgment, (Dkt.\nNo. 156), and Plaintiff has cross-moved for summary\njudgment or, in the alternative, for partial summary\njudgment on the legal issue of whether any legitimate,\npenological interest justified assigning males officers\nto videotape the strip searches, (Dkt. No. 171). \nPlaintiff presents two theories in support of judgment\nin her favor.  First, she contends that the policy of\npermitting male guards to be present to videotape the\nstrip searches โ- even if they somehow refrained from\nactually viewing the inmates while performing the\nvideotaping โ- violated the Constitution.  The court\nagrees that this policy violated the class membersโ\nconstitutional rights and that no legitimate,\npenological interest justified it.  Moreover,\nDefendants are not entitled to the protection of\nqualified immunity for this violation. \nGiven this, it will be unnecessary for the court to\naddress in detail Plaintiffโs second contention, that\nthe policy foreseeably resulted in male officers\nactually viewing strip searches of female inmates and\nthat such viewing constituted a violation Plaintiffโs\nconstitutional rights under clearly established law. \nPlaintiff is correct that at the relevant time period,\nclear authority established that, if such viewing did\n-2-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 3 of 38\noccur in a manner that was more than incidental or\ninadvertent, it violated the Constitution and\nDefendants would not be shielded by qualified immunity. \nIf the court needed to address this second theory of\nrecovery, however, a trial would be necessary in order\nto determine whether actual viewing, as opposed to\nvideotaping without looking, occurred.  It would also\nbe necessary to determine whether Defendants were\nlegally responsible for the actual viewing. \nIn sum, because Plaintiff will prevail on her\npredominant claim, the court will deny Defendantsโ\nmotion for summary judgment and allow Plaintiffโs\nmotion on the issue of liability.  Further proceedings\nwill be necessary to determine the appropriate\npotential equitable relief and monetary damages.\nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\nPlaintiff, Debra Baggett, was a prisoner at the\nWestern Massachusetts Regional Womenโs Correctional\nCenter (โWCCโ) from September 5, 2008, through\nSeptember 12, 2008, and again from October 2, 2008,\nthrough January 28, 2010.  She represents a class of\n2    Unless otherwise noted, the facts are drawn from\nDefendantsโ Statement of Material Facts (Dkt. No. 160),\nPlaintiffโs Statement of Material Facts (Dkt. No. 173),\nPlaintiffโs Counter Statement of Material Facts (Dkt.\nNo. 174), and Defendantsโ Counter Statement of Material\nFacts (Dkt. No. 195), along with the documents\nreferenced therein.\n-3-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 4 of 38\napproximately 178 former and current inmates of the WCC\nwho, upon transfer to the segregation unit, were\nsubjected to a strip search videotaped by male\ncorrectional officers.  As noted, Defendants are\nMichael J. Ashe, Jr., the Sheriff of Hampden County,\nand Patricia Murphy, Assistant Superintendent in charge\nof the WCC.\nThe WCC is an all-female facility that houses\ndetainees and sentenced prisoners from the four western\ncounties of Massachusetts.  If a prisoner presented as\na suicide risk, committed certain disciplinary\ninfractions, or needed to be in protective custody, she\nwas transferred to the segregation unit to separate her\nfrom the general population.  \nThe WCC maintained a set of policies that governed\nthe transfer of prisoners into that unit, specifically\nPolicy and Procedure (โP&Pโ) 3.1.7.  A transition team\nheaded by Defendant Murphy wrote the policies, though\nDefendants Ashe and Murphy discussed them while they\nwere being drafted.  There is no dispute that Ashe and\nMurphy were responsible for the policy.  During the\nprocess, the team also relied on an expert consultant,\nJohn Milosovich.  The policy was updated nearly every\nyear, though its central tenants remained the same. \n(Murphy Aff. (Defs.โ Ex. D), Dkt. No 164, Exs. 1-6.)\n-4-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 5 of 38\nThe policy adopted by Defendants required, at a\nminimum, four officers to move an inmate to\nsegregation.  The officers effectuated the move by\ncuffing the inmateโs wrists, shackling her ankles,\nconducting a pat search, and leading her into the unit. \nIf an inmate were not compliant, additional officers\nwould assist.  Any inmate transferred into the unit was\nsubject to a strip and body cavity search.  This\nrequired the inmate to run her fingers through her\nhair, remove dentures if she wore them, raise both\narms, lift her breasts, lift her stomach for visual\ninspection if she had a large mid-section, and remove\nany tampon or pad if she were menstruating.  She was\nthen required to turn around, bend over, spread her\nbuttocks, and cough.  \nThe policy also specified the location of the strip\nsearches.  They would occur either in the individual\nsegregation unit itself or in the segregation intake\nroom.  If the search occurred in the individual cell,\nat least two female officers would remain with the\nprisoner during the search.  If the supervisor were\nfemale, she would also remain in the cell.  However, if\nthe supervisor were male, the policy dictated that he\nโremain[] in the cell but stand[] in the doorway.โ  \n(Murphy Aff. (Defs.โ Ex. D), Dkt. No 164, Ex. 1.) \n-5-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 6 of 38\nAlternatively, if the search occurred in the intake\nroom, the entire transfer team would remain in the\nroom.\nOne officer was responsible for videotaping the\ntransfer from the beginning of the move through, and\nincluding, the strip search.  The filming officer was\nexpected to stand just outside of the cell and point\nthe camera in the direction of the inmate.  From 2007\nto 2010, the policy stated that if a male officer held\nthe camera, he was to โstand[] outside the cell facing\nthe Dayroom [away from the cell] with the camera\npointing inside the cell and record[ing] the prisoner\nfrom the neck up.โ  (Murphy Aff. (Defs.โ Ex. D), Dkt.\nNo 164, Exs. 1 & 2.)  From 2010 to 2012, the policy\nrequired โthe officer operating the video camera, if\nmale, [to] stand[] outside the cell with the camera\npointing inside the cell and record[ing] the prisoner.โ \n(Murphy Aff. (Defs.โ Ex. D), Dkt. No 164, Exs. 3-4.) \nSince March 2012, the policy mandated that male\nofficers operating the camera stand โoutside the cell\nand position[] the camera on the prisoner from the neck\nup . . . then turn[] his head to the side to afford the\nprisoner as much privacy as possible.โ  (Murphy Aff.\n(Defs.โ Ex. D), Dkt. No 164, Ex. 5.)  \n-6-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 7 of 38\nIn other words, male officers filming the strip\nsearch were required under the policy to conduct the\nfilming while attempting to avoid looking at the\nsubject being filmed and, at the same time, taking care\nto film the unseen inmate only from the neck up. \nAccording to Plaintiff, when this section of the policy\nwas being drafted, Mr. Milosovich questioned the need\nfor the videotaping at all and expressed doubts that\nmale guards, as a practical matter, could consistently\nfollow the very awkward procedure as it was prescribed. \n(Dkt. No. 175, Ex. 28 at 15 (stating โhow can you be\nsure that [the camera] will stay from the neck up . . . \nSuggest someone check to make sure a strip search can\nbe video taped at allโ).) \nSince September 15, 2008, a male guard has held the\ncamera during 274 strip searches.  For 90% of these\nsearches, two or more female guards were in the cell,\nand during 58%, three or more females were present. \nDuring that period, Defendants employed on the security\nstaff roughly 31 female officers and 49 to 54 male\nofficers.  According to Plaintiff, several women\ncomplained to WCC staff about the cross-sex videotaping\npolicy. \nIn May 2010, Plaintiffโs counsel sent a letter to\nDefendants, informing them that he believed this policy\n-7-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 8 of 38\nwas unconstitutional.  Around the same time, Defendants\naltered P&P 3.1.7 to restrict the circumstances under\nwhich male officers could operate the camera.  Female\nofficers were required to do the videotaping unless\nโimpracticable.โ (Murphy Aff. ยถ 110 (Defs.โ Ex. D),\nDkt. No. 164, Ex. 3.)  Between May 2010 and September\n2011, male officers held the camera 26% of the time. \nSince September 2011, when this suit was filed, males\nhave held the camera only 2.5% of the time.  From\nJanuary 1, 2013 to July 31, 2013, a male held the\ncamera only one time out of 96 total transfers.  \nThough it is undisputed that male officers operated\nthe cameras, the parties vigorously dispute whether\nmales actually viewed the female inmates during the\nsearches and, if they did, whether such viewing was\nmore than incidental or inadvertent.  Plaintiff relies\non the testimony of five members of the class who\ndiscussed their experiences.  They described their\nobservations of male officers viewing them during strip\nsearches.  As Plaintiff herself testified, โSometimes I\ncould see their eyes and . . . sometimes the camera was\nobscuring the face but I almost always could see their\nface.โ  (Baggett Dep. 279:13-19, Dkt. No. 175, Ex. 13\nat 2.)  She further said, โThey were looking at me, at\nmy direction, their faces were pointed and their\n-8-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 9 of 38\npostures and everything were pointed directly at me.โ \n(Id. 281:17-22.)  Plaintiff also provides testimony\nfrom a former WCC corrections officer who claimed that\nmale officers would simply โstand off to the side and\njust watch the viewfinder.โ  (Matlasz Dep. 53:11-15,\nDkt. No. 175, Ex. 5 at 4.) \nMoreover, Plaintiff points to the videos\nthemselves, 68% of which show some or all of the\nwomenโs genitals, buttocks, or breasts, and 82% of\nwhich show some portion of the women below the neck.  \nBased upon the steadiness of the camera and the footage\nof the inmatesโ bodies, she believes that a male\nofficer had to be facing the inmates (or watching\nthrough the viewfinder) to keep the camera as still as\nit was and trained on the correct area in the cell. \nDefendants, meanwhile, provide testimony from 11\nformer and current officers who state that they never\nwitnessed a camera operator actually viewing a search. \nMore broadly, Defendants believe that Plaintiffโs\nevidence is insufficient to establish anything more\nthan incidental viewing. \nOn September 15, 2011, Plaintiff filed this one-\ncount complaint against Defendants alleging a violation\nof 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  This court, on May 23, 2013,\ncertified a class of โapproximately 178 former and\n-9-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 10 of 38\ncurrent WCC inmates who were videotaped by male\ncorrectional officers during strip searches.โ  (Dkt.\nNo. 86.)  \nOn February 21, 2014, Defendants filed their Motion\nfor Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 156), and Plaintiff\ncross-filed on March 19, 2014 (Dkt. No. 171).  As\nnoted, Plaintiff also moved, in the alternative, for\npartial summary judgment on the issue of whether any\ntrue emergency or other legitimate, penological\ninterest justified assigning male officers to videotape\nthe strip searches.  On April 22, 2014, the court heard\nargument on the motions and took the matter under\nadvisement. \nIII.  DISCUSSION\nOn summary judgment, the facts and all reasonable\ninferences that might be drawn from them are viewed in\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Pac.\nIns. Co., Ltd. v. Eaton Vance Mgmt., 396 F.3d 584, 588\n(1st Cir. 2004).  When addressing cross-motions for\nsummary judgment, โthe court must consider each motion\nseparately, drawing inferences against each movant in\nturn.โ Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1\n(1st Cir. 1997).  Summary judgment is appropriate if no\n-10-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 11 of 38\ngenuine dispute of fact exists and a party is entitled\nto judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. \nPlaintiff only offers one count in this lawsuit โ-\na violation of ยง 1983.  To succeed on this claim, โthe\nchallenged conduct must be attributable to a person\nacting under color of state law . . . [and] the conduct\nmust have worked a denial of rights secured by the\nConstitution or by federal law.โ  Soto v. Flores, 103\nF.3d 1056, 1061-62 (1st Cir. 1997).  The law also\nโrequires the plaintiff to prove not only a deprivation\nof federal right, but also that the defendantโs conduct\nwas a cause in fact of the alleged deprivation.โ  Id.\nat 1062. \nThe first element is undisputedly satisfied in this\ncase.  Defendants were acting in their official\ncapacities when they created the challenged policy. \nNor is causation in doubt; they were directly\nresponsible for the policyโs enactment.  Plaintiffโs\nclaim thus turns on whether Defendantsโ policy violated\nthe Constitution. \nPlaintiff, as noted in the introduction, presents\ntwo theories.  First, she contends that the policy of\npermitting cross-sex videotaping of strip searches --\n-11-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 12 of 38\nirrespective of whether any viewing of the inmate\nactually occurred during the taping โ- violated the\nConstitution.  Alternatively, Plaintiff says, the\nvideotaping violated the Fourth Amendment because it in\nfact did -- regularly and over extended periods of time\n-- result in male guards viewing female inmates during\nthe strip searches.  Each theory will be addressed\nbelow.\nA. Was the Policy of Permitting Cross-Sex Videotaping,\nRegardless of Viewing, Unconstitutional?\nPlaintiffโs initial theory is that the searches\nrequired by the policy permitting cross-sex videotaping\nviolated the class membersโ Fourth Amendment rights,\neven if the male officer doing the videotaping was able\nsomehow to avert his eyes while using the camera.  It\nmust be conceded that the fact scenario posited by this\ntheory is difficult to conjure up.  Nevertheless, this\n(Defendants say) is what occurred, and a fair analysis\nof this first, broader theory of recovery must assume,\nin the light most favorable to Defendants, that any\nvideotaping by male guards occurred without the male\nactually looking at the female inmate he was filming.  \nTo tackle the argument, two questions must be\naddressed: first, did the policy generate\nunconstitutional searches of the class members, and\n-12-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 13 of 38\nsecond, if it did, are Defendants entitled to the\nprotection of qualified immunity?3\n1. Was there a constitutional violation?\nThe Fourth Amendment broadly protects โagainst\nunreasonable searches and seizures.โ  U.S. Const.\namend. IV.  In the narrow context of searches in prison\nfacilities, two interwoven strands of cases are\nrelevant.  The first, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520\n(1978), provides guidance for courts tasked with\ndetermining the reasonableness of a custodial search. \nThe second, Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1978),\nbalances an inmateโs rights against the legitimate\nneeds of prison facilities.  Though the analyses\noverlap to some degree, the cases will be discussed\nseparately for the sake of clarity. \n3   Defendants believe that Plaintiffโs case is a\nโfacialโ challenge to the constitutionality of the\npolicy and, thus, Plaintiff can only succeed if she\nshows that the policy is unconstitutional in every\nconceivable application.  See U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S.\n739 (1987)(noting that a facial challenge must\nestablish โthat no set of circumstances exists under\nwhich the Act would be validโ).  Though difficult to\napply at times, a distinction has emerged between\nโfacialโ challenges โ- which broadly attack a law or\npolicy regardless of the way it is enacted โ- and โas\nappliedโ challenges โ- those that arise from a specific\ndispute about a particular way in which a law is\nimplemented.  See Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State\nRepublican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 450 (2008). \nPlaintiffโs challenge here is brought on behalf of a\nclass of inmates who believe their rights were violated\nby the specific manner in which Defendants applied the\npolicy to them.  It thus arises from a concrete dispute\nand fits neatly into the โas appliedโ category. \n-13-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 14 of 38\na. Bell v. Wolfish\nIn Bell, the Supreme Court considered the\nreasonableness of strip searches conducted on pre-trial\ndetainees in state custody.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558. \nThe Court upheld the policy over a Fourth Amendment\nchallenge and, in doing so, identified a number of\nfactors to consider when assessing the reasonableness\nof these searches.  The elements were: (1) the scope of\nthe search; (2) the manner in which it was conducted;\n(3) the justification for it; and (4) the place where\nit was conducted.  Id. at 559.  To evaluate the policy\nhere, the court must weigh the Bell factors. \nThe first consideration -- the actual scope of the\nsearch -- is not the subject of any substantial dispute\nin the circumstances of this case.  The parties agree\nthat a strip search during a transfer to a segregation\nunit is permissible.  See Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886\n(1st Cir. 1983).  Moreover, the actual strip searches\nwere completed within a reasonable period of time and\nwere no more intrusive than other, constitutionally\npermissible searches.  Id.  \nThe crux of the challenge is the manner in which\nthe searches were conducted -- that is, with male\nofficers present during the strip searches to videotape\nthe female inmates.  In Cookish v. Powell, the First\n-14-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 15 of 38\nCircuit considered whether a strip search of a male\ninmate โconducted within the visual vantage point of\nfemale correctional officersโ violated the Fourth\nAmendment.  945 F.2d 441, 442 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991).  The\nsearch in that case occurred in the immediate aftermath\nof a prison riot.  Id. at 444-45.  Though the court\nultimately found that the defendants in Cookish were\nprotected by qualified immunity, it described the state\nof the law as follows:\n(1) inadvertent, occasional, casual, and/or\nrestricted observations of an inmate's naked\nbody by a guard of the opposite sex did not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment and (2) if the\nobservation was other than inadvertent,\noccasional, casual, and/or restricted, such\nobservation would (in all likelihood) violate\nthe Fourth Amendment, except in an emergency\ncondition.\nId. at 447.\nCookish recognized that, despite their confinement,\ninmates have some limited expectation of privacy.  That\nright โis violated when guards of the opposite sex\nregularly observe him/her engaged in personal\nactivities, such as undressing, showering, and using\nthe toilet.โ  Id. at 446; see also Burns v. Loranger,\n907 F.2d 233 (1st Cir. 1990); Bonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d\n164 (1st Cir. 1986), overruled on other grounds by\nUnwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124 (1st Cir. 1988). \n-15-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 16 of 38\nSince Cookish, the First Circuit has addressed a\nnumber of challenges to custodial strip searches.  The\nCourt of Appeals, when considering the reasonableness\nof such searches, has consistently recognized the risk\nof a constitutional violation posed by the presence of\ncustodial staff of the opposite sex.  For example, in\nRoberts v. State of Rhode Island, the First Circuit\nupheld a strip search policy, in part because โthe\npolicy requires the search to be conducted by officers\nof the same sex as the inmate.โ  239 F.3d 107, 112 (1st\nCir. 2001).  Two years later, the First Circuit again\nupheld a similar policy because โ[i]t was done in a\nprivate area, by a single officer of the same gender,\nand without physical contact.โ  Wood v. Hanock Cnty.\nSheriffโs Depโt, 354 F.3d 57, 69 (1st Cir. 2003).  \nIn 2004, the court expanded its analysis by not\nmerely referencing the gender of the individual\nconducting the search, but broadening the focus to\ninclude the environment of the search itself.  In\napproving the constitutional legitimacy of the search\nin United States v. Cofield, the court noted that โthe\nofficers did not require [the plaintiff] to assume\nhumiliating poses, [or to] expose himself in an\nunnecessarily public place or to members of the\nopposite sex.โ  391 F.3d 334, 337 (1st Cir. 2004). \n-16-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 17 of 38\nDefendantsโ central contention is that these cases\nonly proscribe actual viewing by a guard of the\nopposite sex.  The Constitution, in Defendantsโ view,\ndoes not restrict the mere nearby presence of a male\nofficer during a strip search of a female inmate, even\nif he is operating a video camera, so long as his eyes\nare averted. \nDefendants read the First Circuit case law too\nnarrowly.  Underpinning these authorities is the\nunderstandable implication that even the nearby\npresence of an individual of the opposite sex during a\nstrip search can be, in itself, a deeply humiliating\nexperience.  No inmate placed in such a vulnerable and\nexposed position should have to rely, or comfortably\nwould rely, on the scrupulousness of an officer of the\nopposite sex turning his or her head as a safeguard to\nthe inmateโs privacy and basic dignity.  \nAny other conclusion would defy human nature.  Even\nif an officer, standing a few feet away and pointing a\nvideo camera at an inmate of the opposite sex, did in\nfact avert his or her eyes from the scene entirely (as\nperhaps many, or -โ as Defendants contend -- all do),\nthe humiliating sense of exposure arising in this\nsituation would be virtually as extreme, from the\nviewpoint of the inmate, as it would be if the inmate\n-17-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 18 of 38\nknew the officer were actually looking.  It is possible\nsome inmates might not care, but for the vast majority\nof inmates the scene would reasonably be experienced as\npainfully degrading.  To suggest otherwise is to ignore\nthe inborn sense of privacy most human beings harbor\nfrom childhood through the end of life.  \nMoreover, in this case -- as Defendant Ashe himself\nnoted -- utilizing a female officer rather than a male\nunquestionably would add โto the dignity and worth and\nprivacyโ of the individual inmate.  (Ashe Dep. 110:20-\n111:4, Dkt. No. 175 at 44-45, Ex. 6.)   \nAdmittedly, the explicit holding of Cookish is that\nit is a violation of the Constitution, except in very\nlimited circumstances, when an officer of the opposite\nsex actually views a strip search.  The case does not\nsuggest, however, that the nearby presence of an\nofficer of the opposite sex pointing a video camera at\nan inmate during a strip search, and the forced\nreliance of that inmate on the officerโs strict\ncompliance with a procedure requiring him or her to\nlook away during the filming, would satisfy the\nConstitution.  Cofieldโs use of the word โexposureโ\nreveals the core value being protected, which is the\ninmateโs privacy and basic dignity, experienced from\nthe inmateโs point of view.  The constitutionality of\n-18-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 19 of 38\nthe search does not hinge solely on what the officer of\nthe opposite sex happens to see but, instead, on the\ndegradingly vulnerable position the inmate is forcibly\nplaced in.  \nHere, the male official is present during the\nentire transition to segregation and the subsequent\nstrip search.  It is undisputed that the female inmate\nis fully aware that a male guard is videotaping her.\nIndeed, if she looks, she can see him holding the\ncamera in her direct line of sight from a few feet\naway.  The applicable procedure then requires the\nfemale inmate to strip naked and manipulate her body\nwhile in the direct presence of the male guard\nvideotaping her.  The inmate will be ordered to lift\nher breasts, spread her legs, bend over, and spread her\nbuttocks.  For the female inmate, the knowledge that\nthe nearby male is obliged to look away (if, indeed,\nshe is aware of this restriction) cannot, to any\nsignificant degree, minimize the extreme level of\nexposure she experiences.  The fact that the male\nofficer, while operating the video camera, may be\nturned to one side or have his back turned will do\nlittle, for most female inmates, to diminish the sense\nof embarrassment, humiliation, and vulnerability that\nshe must inevitably feel.  \n-19-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 20 of 38\nUltimately then, the constitutional violation here\narises from the male video operatorโs close presence\nwhile the female inmate is required โnot only to strip\nnaked in front of a stranger, but also to expose the\nmost private areas of her body.โ  Swain v. Spinney, 117\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).  For the reasons stated, the\nconduct of these searches breached the constitutional\nboundary to such a degree that, even if the remaining\ntwo Bell factors did not favor Plaintiffโs position,\nthe policy would still be a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.4  A review of these factors, however, reveals\nthat, for the most part, they favor Plaintiff.\nThe next factor identified by the Supreme Court is\nDefendantsโ justification for the policy.  In their\ninitial memorandum (Dkt. No. 159), Defendants noted\nthat 103 C.M.R.  924.06(3)(f) authorized strip\nยง \nsearches upon an inmateโs transfer into segregation. \nBased on this, they argued, the policy was justified.  \nThe problem with this initial argument is that the\nidentified regulation only supports the policy insofar\nas it calls for the strip searches.  No one, not even\n It is well established that an emergency situation\n4\n  \nmay justify a search that would otherwise be\nunconstitutional.  As Cookish makes clear, extenuating\ncircumstances may require a male to videotape the\nsearch.  945 F.2d at 447.  Here however, with only one\nexception, Defendants do not contend that an emergency\never justified the male presence.\n-20-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 21 of 38\nPlaintiff, disputes the propriety of strip searches\nduring transfers to segregation, per se.  As invasive\nas they necessarily are, these searches do not violate\nthe Constitution and, indeed, constitute an appropriate\nsafeguard in the custodial environment.  The\nregulation, however, is silent as to the practice of\nvideotaping these searches and, more importantly, as to\nthe permissibility of an individual of the opposite sex\nholding the camera.  \nIn their reply memorandum, (Dkt. No. 193),\nDefendants offer a number of practical justifications\nfor the videotaping policy.  Again, however, while\nvideotaping strip searches may, to some extent, be\ncontroversial, Plaintiff does not take the position\nthat videotaping itself violates the Constitution.  The\nprocedure undoubtedly has advantages.  It provides an\nobjective record of the transition into segregation,\nenhances professionalism, and deters both misconduct\nand false accusations of misconduct.  None of these\npurported justifications, however, covers the use of\nmale staff to videotape female inmates.\nOnly one asserted justification bears directly on\nthe issue of the officerโs gender.  The ability to\nutilize a male officer to videotape females during\nstrip searches, Defendants contend, provides\n-21-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 22 of 38\nflexibility during potentially urgent situations.  A\ntransfer to segregation can be fraught with risk;\nserious problems can arise quickly and unpredictably. \nThe possible use of a male guard to handle videotaping\n-- a male instructed to look away while conducting the\ntaping -- helps to ensure the safety and security of\nstaff and inmates.  \nTo buttress this point, Defendants point to one\nevent in 2013 where an immediate need arose to transfer\nan inmate to segregation, but no female officer was\navailable to handle the videotaping.  The flexibility\nof the policy permitted a male officer to hold the\ncamera and complete the transfer promptly.  This\nprevented a potentially dangerous situation from\nspinning out of control.5  \nThe shortcoming in this legal argument is that\nPlaintiff does not dispute the constitutional\nlegitimacy of cross-sex videotaping in a true\nemergency.  All the case law recognizes this\nregrettable but necessary contingency.  Moreover, as a\nfactual matter, the record provides no support for the\nsuggestion that, at least prior to 2013, videotaping of\nstrip searches by male officers was limited to urgent\n5   Defendants offer additional justifications under the\nSupreme Courtโs Turner decision, which are addressed\nbelow.  \n-22-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 23 of 38\nsituations.  In fact, the record confirms that female\nofficers were not only available but actually present\nduring the vast majority of strip searches.  The\nevidence also demonstrates that Defendants employed\nfemale officers at a roughly similar rate as male\nofficers.  Critically, no evidence in this record\nsuggests that the lack of a female officer would have\nrequired postponement of a transfer, or generated any\nrisk, in any but the rarest of circumstances. \nMoreover, if male guards were potentially needed in\nemergency situations to effectuate swift moves โ- a\nsituation Plaintiff concedes might require cross-sex\nvideotaping โ- this contingency still would not justify\nthe challenged policy.6  The 2013 event described by\nDefendants, one that occurred well after Defendants\naltered their policy, illustrated the feasibility of a\nnarrowly crafted exception covering a truly urgent\nsituation.  It does not, however, provide support for a\ncarte blanche license to use male guards regularly to\nvideotape strip searches of female inmates.  \n6   Defendants take issue with Plaintiffโs narrow\ndefinition of an emergency.  The court need not address\nthis disagreement since it is undisputed that no\nemergency, however defined, precipitated the searches\nat issue in this case.  \n-23-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 24 of 38\nIn sum, Defendantsโ attempt to offer justifications\nfor their policy is flatly inadequate to provide a\nbandage for its constitutional deficiencies. \nThe final Bell factor is the location of the\nsearches.  The policy, as noted, provides two different\nlocations where the searches can occur, the segregation\nunit itself and the intake area.  Plaintiff contends\nthat both areas are too public; Defendants disagree. \nThe importance of this issue may be secondary compared\nto the gender issue and, in any event, the partiesโ\ndisagreement raises an issue of fact.  Notably, even\nassuming Defendants are correct, it would still not\nsave the policy given the unreasonableness of the\nmanner of the searches, and thus the disagreement does\nnot implicate any material fact precluding entry of\nsummary judgment.  \nTo summarize, examination of the Bell factors\nestablishes that the strip searches of class members in\nthis case, to the extent they occurred with male\nofficers in the immediate vicinity conducting\nvideotaping, were unreasonable regardless of whether\nthe officers actually viewed the inmates.  Plaintiffโs\nFourth Amendment rights were violated by the mere\npresence of a male officer nearby conducting the\nvideotaping during her strip search.  Since Plaintiffโs\n-24-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 25 of 38\nrights were violated, the analysis shifts to the Turner\ncase. \nb.  Turner v. Safley\nAlthough the policy violates Plaintiffโs Fourth\nAmendment rights, that finding must still survive the\nTurner analysis.  At issue in that case was, inter\nalia, the permissibility of restricting an inmateโs\nright to marry.  The Courtโs holding, broad in nature,\nis relevant here.  \nIn determining the permissibility of a prison\nregulation, the Court said, โ[W]hen a prison regulation\nimpinges on an inmatesโ constitutional rights, the\nregulation is valid if reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interests.โ  Turner, 42 U.S. at 89.  Turner \nprovided four factors to be weighed in making that\ndetermination: (1) whether there exists a valid,\nrational connection between the regulation and the\ngovernmental interest; (2) whether โthere are\nalternative means of exercising the right that remain\nopen to prison inmatesโ; (3) the impact the demanded\naccommodation would have on the facility, staff, and\ninmates; and (4) the availability or absence of ready\nalternatives to the complained of policy.  Id.   \nDefendants believe that each factor illuminates a\nreasonable relationship between their policy and a\n-25-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 26 of 38\nvalid, penological interest.  Plaintiff, meanwhile,\ncontends that Defendants have the weaker argument on\neach factor and that she is, at a minimum, entitled to\npartial summary judgment on the question of whether any\nemergency or legitimate interest justified the\nsearches. \nAs to the first factor -- the connection between\nthe policy and the goal -- Defendants reiterate their\nargument that videotaping the searches is justified and\nthat male guards are a critical component to carrying\nout that policy.  Moreover, they assert that the use of\nmales permits flexibility in staffing and ensures that\nthe WCC can provide equal employment opportunities.\nThese arguments are unpersuasive.  Though\nvideotaping itself may be appropriate, nothing supports\nthe conclusion that male guards need to be utilized to\nconduct the videotaping outside of emergency\nsituations.  Indeed, since this litigation began,\nDefendants have essentially adopted a policy requiring\nonly female guards to videotape the searches and have\nnot encountered any problems. \nDefendantsโ employment-related arguments rely\nsolely on speculation.  The record offers no examples\nof employees complaining about their assignments; no\ndata evidences staffing problems.  Nothing in the\n-26-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 27 of 38\nrecord suggests that permitting males routinely to\nvideotape strip searches enhanced employment\nopportunities for anyone.  Therefore, Defendants have\nfailed to establish a valid connection between the\npolicy and their purported goals.  \nThe second Turner factor, the existence of an\nalternative to exercise the identified constitutional\nright -- in this case, the right to be free from an\nunreasonable search -- favors Plaintiff.  Defendants\nhave conceded that their policy left no room for an\nalternative method to exercise this right.  Bull v. San\nFrancisco, 595 F.3d 964, 973 n.9 (9th Cir.\n2010)(stating that the right to be free from an\nunreasonable search โis not a right susceptible to\nexercise by alternative meansโ).\n   With respect to the third Turner factor โ- the\nimpact the demanded accommodation would have on the\nfacility, staff, and inmates โ- Defendants repeat their\nargument that, in order to avoid compromising the\noperation of their facility, their only feasible option\nwas to restrict male guards from viewing female inmates\nduring strip searches, not from videotaping them.  This\nrule, they point out, was already in place at the time\nthis lawsuit was filed and was sufficient.  Any other\naccommodation, such as excluding males entirely from\n-27-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 28 of 38\nvideotaping strip searches (except in an emergency or\notherwise urgent situation), would, Defendants argue,\nhave reduced Defendantsโ flexibility and undermined\nsecurity. \nThe flaw in this argument, as this memorandum has\nalready noted, is that the record offers no support for\nDefendantsโ contention that utilizing female guards for\nvideotaping strip searches decreased Defendantsโ\nability to effectuate transfers to segregation in non-\nurgent situations.  On the contrary, Defendantsโ\ncurrent policy of strictly limiting the presence of\nmales during strip searches has shown that the\noverwhelming majority of transfers to segregation can\nbe managed easily within constitutional boundaries. \nPlaintiffโs proffered alternative to the policy as it\nexisted at the time this lawsuit was filed was clearly\na feasible accommodation that minimally burdened the\nfacility, staff, and inmates.   \nOn the final Turner factor -- the availability and\nbenefits of ready alternatives โ- Defendants argue that\nno available alternative would have provided the same\nbenefits as the challenged policy.  Defendants itemize\na number of options they consider inferior to\nvideotaping: an audio recording, not utilizing a\ncamera, using a tripod, or using a ceiling camera. \n-28-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 29 of 38\nThey believe that each alternative would present\nserious problems.  An inmate could say something false\non an audio recording; an emergency might arise that\nwould need to be documented on camera; the tripod could\nbe used as a weapon; a ceiling camera would actually be\nmore invasive.  In sum, a video camera held by a\nperson, Defendants say, was the only option that, as a\npractical matter, accomplished Defendantsโ goals. \nDefendantsโ contentions may all very well be true,\nbut they miss the point.  At the risk of repetition, \nthis dispute is not about the propriety of videotaping\nthe searches per se.  It is about who should be holding\nthe camera.  Since the only real alternative is to\nrequire female guards to hold the camera except in\ncases of emergencies, and Defendants have failed to\nshow why this would not be feasible โ- indeed, such a\npolicy appears to have effectively been adopted at this\npoint โ- the court must conclude that the final Turner\nfactor manifestly favors Plaintiff. \nAs a final plea, Defendants suggest that deference\nunder Turner is particularly appropriate here for a\nnumber of reasons.  First, Defendants utilized an\nexpert when drafting the regulations to ensure that\nthey were legally permissible.  Second the WCC has\napplied for and received accreditation from the\n-29-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 30 of 38\nAmerican Correctional Association, which did a complete\nreview of every policy and procedure, including the\npolicy governing videotaping.  Finally, the\nMassachusetts Department of Corrections audited the WCC\ntwice a year, and no issues respecting the policy were\never flagged.  \nNone of these reasons justifies deference to the\nparticular policy at issue.  First, use of an expert,\nthough prudent, cannot innoculate an unconstitutional\npolicy.  Here, in any event, a particular irony adheres\nto this argument since Defendantsโ expert explicitly\nwarned that the policy presented both practical and\nlegal problems.  (Dkt. No. 175, Ex. 28 at 15.)\nDefendantsโ other arguments essentially assert that\nsince no one who reviewed the policy found a problem\nwith it, no problem existed.  Again, while the use of\nreview by outside entities reflected prudence and\nprofessionalism on the part of Defendants, the fact\nthat these entities did not condemn the videotaping\npolicy obviously cannot, ipso facto, render it\nconstitutional.  \nIn sum, no legitimate penological interest\njustified the regular practice of using male officers\nto videotape female inmates while they were being strip\nsearched, even assuming the officers respected the\n-30-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 31 of 38\npolicy requirement to avert their eyes while operating\nthe camera.  Moreover, nothing in the record indicates\nthat any emergency situation ever required the use of\nmale officers to handle videotaping.  Since the policy\nviolated the Fourth Amendment rights of the class\nmembers, and since Turner does not save Defendants, the\npolicy as applied to class members was\nunconstitutional. \n2. Qualified Immunity\nQualified immunity protects officials performing\ndiscretionary functions when their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable officer should have known. \nWilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609 (1999).  Qualified\nimmunity is not appropriate where (1) an official\nviolated a constitutional or statutory right, and (2)\nthe right was โclearly establishedโ at the time the\nimpermissible conduct occurred.  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,\n131 S.Ct. 2074, 2080 (2011), citing Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). \nDefendants contend that qualified immunity is\nappropriate here for two reasons.  First, the legal\nquestion at the heart of this case is obscure, and no\n-31-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 32 of 38\nclearly established law existed at the time of the\nviolation.  If anything, Defendants say, the law\nsupported their approach since courts have consistently\nupheld the use of video cameras to record searches.\nSee, e.g., Powell v. Cusimano, 326 F. Supp. 2d 322, 335\n(D. Conn. 2004).  Second, Defendants say, they strived\nto ensure that the policy complied with the\nConstitution โ- for example, they hired an expert and\nhad the procedures audited โ- and therefore acted\nreasonably in concluding that it was permissible.\nThough Defendantsโ argument has some traction, it\nis ultimately unpersuasive.  They essentially concede\nthat, at the relevant time period, the Constitution\nclearly prohibited males from conducting strip searches\nof female inmates, or from viewing the strip searches,\nexcept where such viewing was inadvertent or in\nemergency situations.  These cases, they argue, were\ninsufficient to put them on notice that the practice of\nhaving a male officer videotape a strip search of a\nfemale inmate without looking at the inmate violated\nthe inmateโs rights.  \n-32-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 33 of 38\nOn the question of when a constitutional right is\nclearly established, the Supreme Court has emphasized\nthat โa case directly on pointโ is not required. \nAshcroft, 131 S.Ct. at 2083.  Instead, the inquiry is\nwhether the law โplaced the statutory or constitutional\nquestion beyond debate.โ \nAt the time of this constitutional violation,\nclearly established law prohibited a male officer from\nviewing a female inmate during a strip search. \n945 F.2d \nCookish,  at 447.  It was also plainly\nunconstitutional to require a female inmate to expose\nherself, particularly to the extreme degree required\nduring a strip search, in the presence of a male\nCofield, 391 F.3d at 337.  Given these cases,\nofficer.  \nany reasonable official would have recognized the\nunreasonableness of requiring a female inmate to strip\nin the presence of a male officer holding a video\ncamera and pointing it at her.  The unconstitutionality\nof such a policy was, quite simply, \nโa foregone\nconclusion.โ  Bonitz, 804 F.2d at 173 n.10.  Given the\nclarity of the law at the time the policy was put in\nplace, a reasonable official would have been properly\n-33-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 34 of 38\non notice that the policy would inevitably result in an\nunconstitutional search. \n  Moreover, even if the state of the law were\nambiguous โ- which it was not โ- this policy was so\nclearly โantithetical to human dignityโ that qualified\nimmunity would still be inappropriate.  Hope v. Pelzer,\n536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002).  Any reasonable official\nviewing the policy would have concluded that it had the\npotential to humiliate and demean the female inmates. \nHowever sincere Defendantsโ attempts to comply with the\nlaw may have been, it was unreasonable for them to\nneglect the obvious ramifications of their policy. \nUltimately, a reasonable individual in Defendantsโ\nposition could not have concluded that permitting male\nofficers to videotape female inmates during strip\nsearches โ- even if the officers looked away โ- was\nconstitutional.  Therefore, Defendants are not entitled\nto the protections of qualified immunity, and Plaintiff\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nB. Was the Policy Unconstitutional Because It\nForeseeably Led to Cross-Sex Viewing of Strip\nSearches?\n-34-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 35 of 38\nThe courtโs ruling on Plaintiffโs first theory\nmakes extended discussion of her second theory\nunnecessary.  Plaintiff asserts that the videotaping\npolicy was also unconstitutional because it in fact\ninevitably led to male officers actually viewing, in a\nmanner that was not merely incidental or inadvertent, \nstrip searches of female inmates in non-emergency\nsituations.\nAs a legal matter, if Plaintiffโs assertions were\nshown to be true โ- i.e., male officers regularly\nviewed female inmates during strip searches โ- she\nwould be entitled to judgment in her favor.  Cookish\nand its progeny, as discussed, undisputedly hold that\nin non-emergency situations cross-sex viewing that is\nmore than incidental or inadvertent violates the\nConstitution.  Cookish, 945 F.2d at 447.  Qualified\nimmunity would certainly not protect Defendants given\nthis case law. \nSummary judgment, however, would not be available\non this alternate theory on the current record of this\ncase, based on two disputed issues of fact: did the\npolicy result in actual viewing that was more than\n-35-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 36 of 38\nincidental or inadvertent, and, if so, were these\nspecific Defendants legally responsible for the\nviewing?  Plaintiff relies on the testimony of five\nclass members, the videos themselves, and testimony by\na former WCC officer to support her position. \nDefendants, in turn, provide testimony from eleven\nofficers to the effect that male guards handling\nvideotaping did not routinely view female inmates\nduring searches.  Moreover, Defendants argue, any\nviewing that did occur was incidental and therefore\ninsufficient to create a pattern or practice of\nunconstitutional conduct for which these Defendants\nwould be liable.  \nOn Plaintiffโs second theory, if this case went to\ntrial, Defendants might have their work cut out for\nthem.  The notion that a male officer could\nsuccessfully perform the job of videotaping a female\ninmateโs strip search (and keep the camera focused on\nthe neck up as the policy required) without actually\nobserving the search seems, to put it mildly, dubious. \nThe practical demands of the task, keeping the camera\nsteady and trained on the correct location in the cell,\n-36-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 37 of 38\nwould make this argument a hard sell to a jury.  Of\ncourse, as the court has already noted, the degrading\nexposure of the female inmate placed in this position\nshould have made the constitutional violation inherent\nin this practice manifest to Defendants.  Nevertheless,\nto the extent that Plaintiff offers actual viewing as a\nยง\nbasis for her claim of a violation of   1983, the\nrecord contains sufficiently documented disputed issues\nof fact to render summary judgment inappropriate on\nthis alternate theory.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION\nManaging a correctional facility is a uniquely\ndifficult task, and Defendant Sheriff Michael J. Ashe\nJr., has a well deserved reputation not only for highly\ncompetent administration but for sensitivity to the\nrights and the welfare of the inmates he is responsible\nfor.  The hallmark of his long tenure as Sheriff has\nbeen scrupulous attention to the dignity of every\ninmate, consistent with the operational requirements of\nthe particular facility. \nUnfortunately, in this case a misjudgment occurred\nresulting in a policy that clearly transgressed the\n-37-\n\nCase 3:11-cv-30223-MAP   Document 219   Filed 08/26/14   Page 38 of 38\nConstitution and injured the plaintiff class.  For this\nreason, Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt.\nNo. 156) is hereby DENIED, and  Plaintiffsโ Motion for\nSummary Judgment (Dkt. No. 171) is hereby ALLOWED on\nthe issue of liability.  \nBy September 9, 2014, Plaintiff shall submit a\nproposed schedule to address the questions of potential\nequitable relief and monetary damages.  If Plaintiffโs\nproposal is not assented to, Defendants may submit\ntheir counter-proposal by September 23, 2014. \nIt is So Ordered.\n/s/ Michael A. Ponsor \nMICHAEL A. PONSOR\nU. S.

This  1s  a  ctvil  rights  class  action  for money  damages  against Hampden  County  Sheriff \nMichaelJ . Ashe, Jr.,  and  Assistant  Superintendent Patricia  Murphy  for permitting  male  guards  at  the \nWestern  Massachusetts  Regional Womenโs  Correctional  Center  (โWCCโ)  to  view  and  videotape \nstrip-searches  of women  inmates.  Women  at  the  WCC  who  cannot  remain  in  the  general  prison \npopulation  for mental  health  or  disciplinary  reasons  are  taken  to  the  Segregation  Unit.  With  four  or \nmore  officers  present,  the  inmate  must  take  off all  her  clothes  and  perform  a  series  of actions:  she \nmust lean  forward,  lift  her  arms,  lift  her  breasts  and,  if large,  her  stomach,  turn  around,  bend  over, \nspread  her  buttocks  with  her  hands  and  cough,  and  stand  up  and  face  the  wall.  An  officer with  a \nvideo  camera  stands  a  few  feet  away  and  records  the  entire  strip  search.  This  officer is  almost  always \nmale,  in  violation  of the  federal  Constitution,  Massachusetts  law,  national  correctional  standards,  and \nthe  basic  human  dignity  that  these  authorities  are  supposed  to  protect. \n2.  Defendants  Ashe  and  Murphy  are  responsible  for  this  unconstitutional  practice. \nโThey  have  created  and  maintained written  strip  search  policies  that  permit  male  guards  to  record\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  2  of  11 \nnaked women.  โThey  know  of and  condone  the  fact  that  in  practice,  the  guard  recording  the  women \nis  almost  always  male. \n3,  Debra  Baggett,  a  former  an  inmate  at WCC,  suffers  from  mental illness,  which \nresulted  in  her  being  taken  to  the  Segregation  Unit  numerous  times.  April  Marlborough,  another \nformer inmate,  was  also  taken  to  the  Segregation  Unit;  like  many  other inmates  at WCC,  Ms. \nMarlborough  1s  a  survivor  of sexual  abuse.  Ms.  Baggett  and  Ms.  Marlborough  seek  to  represent  a \nclass  of women  inmates  at WCC  who,  like  them,  were  strip  searched while  a  male  guard watched \nand  took video.  On  information  and  belief,  hundreds  of women  have  been  subjected  to  this \nhumiliating  and  unconstitutional  practice. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n4.  This  action  is  brought  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1983  and  1988  and  the  Fourth  and \nFourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution. Jurisdiction  is  founded  upon  28  U.S.C. \nยงยง  1331  and  1343. \nII.  PARTIES \n5.  Named  plaintiff Debra  Baggett was  at  all  times  relevant  to  this  complaint  a  resident \nof Massachusetts.  Ms.  Baggett was  an  inmate  at  the  WCC  from  September  2008  to January  2010. \n6.  Named  plaintiff April  Marlborough was  at  all  tumes  relevant  to  this  complaint  a \nresident  of Massachusetts.  Ms.  Marlborough was  an  inmate  at  the  WCC  from  May  2008  to  April \n2011. \n7.  Defendant MichaelJ . Ashe, Jr.  was  at  all  times  relevant  to  this  complaint  a  resident \nof Massachusetts.  He  has  been  the  Sheriff of Hampden  County  since  1974.  He  1s  sued  1n  his \nindividual  capacity  for  actions  taken  under  color  of law.\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  3  of  11 \n8.  Defendant Patricia  Murphy was  at  all  times  relevant  to  this  complaint  a  resident  of \nMassachusetts.  She  has  been  the  assistant  superintendent in  charge  of the  WCC  since  it  opened  1n \n2007.  She  is  sued  tn  her individual  capacity  for  actions  taken  under  color  of law. \nIV.  FACTS \n9.  The  Western  Massachusetts  Regional Womenโs  Correctional  Center in  Chicopee \nopened  in  October  2007.  It is  operated  by  the  Hampden  County  Sheriffs  Department.  It  houses \nwomen  detainees  and  convicted  offenders  from  the  four western  counties  in  Massachusetts. \n10.  The  WCC  houses  approximately  230  women  inmates.  Most  of the  women  have  been \nconvicted  of,  or  are  being  detained  for,  nonviolent  offenses.  More  than  a  third  have  mental  health \nproblems.  Many  have  been  victims  of sexual  assault  or  abuse. \n11.  Inmates  at  the  WCC  who  cannot  remain  in  general  population  because  they  have \nmental  health  issues  or  need  to  be  held  in  protective  custody,  or who  commit  certain  disciplinary \ninfractions,  are  taken  to  the  Segregation  Unit. \n12.  Multiple  officers  conduct  the  move.  The  Shift  Commander  leads  the  team,  which \nincludes  at  least  three  other  officers.  If the  inmate  ts  initially  noncompliant,  the  team includes  at  least \nfour  officers,  wearing  riot gear. \n13.  To  begin  the  move,  the  officers  cuff the  tnmateโs  wrists  and  shackle  her  ankles.  A \nfemale  officer  puts  on  gloves  and  conducts  a  thorough  โpat  searchโ  of the  inmateโs  full  body. \n14.  After  leading  the  inmate  into  a  cell in  the  Segregation  Unit,  the  officers  remove  the \ninmateโs  cuffs  and  shackles. \n15.  Allinmates  taken  to  segregation  are  strip  searched,  regardless  of whether  there  1s  any \nreason  to  believe  they  may  be  concealing  a weapon  or  other  contraband.\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  4  of  11 \n16.  An  officer  tells  the  inmate  to  take  off all  of her  clothes.  If the  inmate  1s  menstruating, \nshe  must remove  any  tampon  or  pad  she  1s  using  and  hand  it  to  a  guard. \n17.  Once  naked,  the  inmate  is  ordered  to  lean  forward  and  run  her  fingers  through  her \nhair,  to  remove  her  dentures  if she  wears  them,  to  raise  both  arms,  and  then  to  lift  her  breasts.  If she \nhas  a  large  midsection,  she  must  โlift  her  stomach  for visual inspection.โ \n18.  A guard  tells  the  inmate  to  turn  around  so  that  she  is  facing  away  from  the  officers. \nShe  is  ordered  to  bend  over,  spread  her  buttocks  apart with  her  hands,  and  cough.  She  must bend \nover  far  enough  for guards  to  be  able  to  see  inside  her  anus  and  vagina. \n19.  The  inmate  is  ordered  to  stand  up  and  face  the  wall,  and  to  remain  facing  the  wall \nuntil  the  officers  exit  the  cell. \n20.  During  this  entire  process,  an  officer with  a  handheld  video  camera  stands  just \noutside  the  cell,  a  few  feet  away. \n21.  The  officer  faces  the  inmate  and  records  her  naked  body. \n22.  This  officer is  almost  always  a  male. \n23.  The  Shift  Commander remains  inside  the  cell  throughout  the  strip  search.  About  half \nthe  time,  the  Shift  Commander ts  a  male. \n24.  Twenty  years  ago,  the  United  States  Court  of Appeals  for  the  First  Circuit ruled  that \nunless  there  is  an  emergency,  cross-gender viewing  of an  inmateโs  naked  body  during  a  strip  search \nโwould  (in  all  likelihood)  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment.โ  Cookesh  v.  Powell,  945  F.2d  441,  447  (1% \nCir.  1991)  (per  curtam).  Courts  around  the  country  have  agreed.  See,  ยข.g.,  Byrd v.  Maricopa  County \nSheriff's Dep't,  629  F.3d  1135,  1147  (9%  Cir.  2011)  (en  banc)  (describing  the  โlitany  of cases  over  the\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page 5  of  11 \nlast  thirty yearsโ  finding  that  cross-gender  strip  searches  1n  the  absence  of an  emergency  are \nunconstitutional). \n25.  Massachusetts  regulations  governing  county  correctional  facilities  require  that  strip- \nsearches  be  conducted  โtn  relative  privacy with  as  much  dignity  as  possible  ...  by  staff the  same  sex \nas  the  inmate.โ  103  C.M.R.  924.06(3). \n20.  American  Correctional  Association  standards  state  that  โ[o|nly  staff of the  same  sex \nas  the  offender  participate  in  strip  searches.โ  ACA Adult  Community  Residential  Services  (4  ed.) \n2C-06. \n27.  The  Prison  Rape  Elimination  Act  of 2003  called  for  the  creation  of a  national \ncommission  to  study  the  causes  of prison  sexual  abuse  and  to  develop  standards  designed  to \neradicate  it.  These  standards,  issued  in June  2009,  prohibit  cross-gender  strip  searches  and  viewing \nof inmatesโ  naked  bodies  except in  an  emergency.  See National Prison  Rape  Elimination \nCommission  Standards  for  the  Prevention,  Detection,  Response,  and  Monitoring  of Sexual Abuse  in \nAdult Prisons  and Jails,  PP-4. \n28.  Longstanding  United  Nations  standards  prohibit  men  from  supervising women \nprisoners  at  all.  See  United  Nations  Standard  Minimum  Rules  for  the  โT'reatment  of Prisoners  {|  53. \n29.  Defendantsโ  written  procedures  pay  lip  service  to  the  well-established  prohibition  on \nmale  guardsโ  viewing  of female  strip  searches.  In  practice,  however,  guards  do  not  follow  the  written \nprocedures. \n30.  WCC  Policy  and  Procedure  3.1.7,  titled  โInmate  Movement,โ  sets  forth  the \nprocedures  for moving  an  inmate  to  the  Segregation  Unit,  including  the  requirement  that  the  inmate \nbe  strip  searched  and  that  the  entire  process  be  videotaped.\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  6  of  11 \n31.  Until  early  2010,  the  written  procedure  for videotaping  the  strip  search  stated,  โโUhe \nResponse  Officer  operating  the  video  camera,  if male,  stands  outside  the  cell  facing  the  Dayroom \nwith  the  camera  pointing  inside  the  cell  and  records  the  inmate  from  the  neck up.โ \n32.  This  written  procedure  was  illogical  and  unworkable.  The  officer was  to  face  away \nfrom  the  cell while  recording  activity  behind  his  back inside  the  cell.  It would  be  impossible  to \nrecord  the  inmate  from  the  neck up  without  looking  through  the  camera  lens  or viewfinder.  โThis  1s \nparticularly  so  since  the  inmate  moves  during  the  procedure,  bending  over,  twice,  during  the  strip \nsearch.  If the  inmate  moved  or was  moved  to  another  part  of the  cell,  the  guard would  not  know \nthis,  and  would  not  be  able  to  continue  recording  her  at  all,  unless  he  was  looking  at  her. \n33.  Because  the  written  policy  required  guards  to  do  the  impossible,  they  disregarded  it \nas  a  matter  of course.  Male  guards  faced  inside  the  cell  as  they  recorded  the  female  inmatesโ  naked \nbodies  during  the  strip  search. \n34,  After  recetving inquiries  about  the  policy,  Defendants  changed  the  written  policy in \nearly  2010. \n35.  The  new  policy  states  that  the  officer videotaping  should  be  a  female  โunless \nimpracticable  to  do  so.โ  In  practice,  male  guards  still  almost  always  do  the  videotaping. \n36.  The  new written  policy  contains  instructions  on  how  male  officers  should  videotape \nwomen.  โThese  instructions  reflect what  had  been  and  remains  the  practice:  male  officers  do  not  face \naway  from  the  naked  inmates  and  do  not limit  their recording  to  the  neck  up.  โThe  new written \npolicy  states  simply  that  the  โofficer  operating  the  video  camera,  if male,  stands  outside  the  cell with \nthe  camera  pointing inside  the  cell  and  records  the  inmate.โ\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  7  of  11 \n37.  As  Sheriff,  Defendant  Ashe  is  the  final policymaker  for  the  Hampden  County \nSheriff's  Department.  He  is  responsible  for  all  of the  policies  of the  department,  including  the \nmovement  and  strip  search  policies  of the  WCC.  His  job  responsibilities  include  ensuring  that  the \npolicies  and  practices  of the  WCC  comply with  the  Constitution. \n38.  Defendant Murphy ts  in  charge  of overall  operations  at  the  WCC.  She  is  responsible \nfor  creating  and  implementing  the  policies  and  practices  of the  facility.  Her job  responsibilities \ninclude  ensuring  that  the  policies  and  practices  of the  WCC  comply with  the  Constitution. \n39.  Defendants  Ashe  and  Murphy  created  and  implemented  the  written  strip  search  and \nmovement  procedures  for  the  WCC. \n40.  They  created  and  maintained  these  written  policies  with  knowledge  that  male  guards \nwould  routinely  view  naked  female  inmates  as  they were  being  strip  searched,  or with  reckless \ndisregard  of this  fact. \n41.  Defendants  Ashe  and  Murphy were  aware  that  male  staff were  routinely viewing \nfemale  inmates  during  these  strip  searches  because  women  complained  about  this,  formally  and \ninformally.  However,  Defendants  permitted  the  practice  to  continue. \n42.  Debra  Baggett was  taken  to  the  Segregation  Unit  multiple  tumes  while  she  was  an \ninmate  at  the  WCC,  mostly  for  mental  health  reasons.  On  one  occasion,  she  asked  to  be  taken  into \nprotective  custody  because  she  was  too  afraid  to  remain  in  general  population  after witnessing  a \nfight.  On  this  occasion,  like  every  other  time  she  was  taken  to  segregation,  she  was  strip  searched  in \nthe  manner  described  above,  with  a  male  officer  directly viewing  and  videotaping  her  naked  body \nfrom  a  few  feet  away.  She  felt  humiliated  and  degraded.\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  8  of  11 \n43,  April Marlborough was  taken  to  the  Segregation  Unit  on  one  or  more  occasions  for \ndisciplinary  reasons.  She  was  strip  searched  1n  the  manner  described  above,  with  a  male  officer \ndirectly viewing  and  videotaping  her  naked  body  from  a  few  feet  away.  As  a victim  of sexual  abuse \nas  a  child,  she  felt violated  and  dehumanized  by  this  experience. \nV.  CLASS  ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n44,  This  action  is  brought  pursuant  to  Rule  23(a)  and  (b)  (1)  and  (3)  of the  Federal  Rules \nof Civil  Procedure  by  the  named  Plaintiffs  as  a  class  action  on  behalf of all women  taken  to  the \nSegregation  Unit  at WCC  whose  strip  searches  were  videotaped  by  a  male  officer. \n45,  The  named  plaintiffs,  Debra  Baggett  and  April Marlborough,  are  members  of the \nclass.  โhe  class  represented  by Plaintiffs  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of all  such  persons  ts \nimpractical.  โhe  practice  described  above  has  existed  for  a  period  going  back more  than  three  years \nbefore  this  complaint was  filed.  On  information  and  belief,  it  has  affected  several  hundred  class \nmembers. \n46.  There  are  questions  of law  and  fact  common  to  the  class  of plaintiffs.  Central  to  all \nthe  claims  is  the  nature  and  constitutionality  of the  practice  at  the  WCC  of having  male  guards  view \nand  film  female  inmates  being  strip  searched  upon  being  brought  to  the  Segregation  Unit. \n47.  The  named  plaintiffsโ  claims  or  defenses  are  typical  of the  claims  or  defenses  of the \nclass  of plaintiffs. \n48.  The  named  plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  represent  and  protect  the  interests  of \nthe  members  of the  class.  Counsel  for  the  plaintiffs  1s  experienced  and  capable  in  c1vil  rights \nlitigation.  Class  counsel  has  successfully  represented  plaintiffs  in  other  class  actions  alleging  unlawful \nstrip  searches.  Counsel  has  the  resources  and  expertise  to  prosecute  this  action.\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  9  of  11 \n49.  This  action  1s  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the  prosecutions  of \nseparate  actions  by  the  individual  members  of the  class  would  create  a  risk  of inconsistent  or varying \nadjudications  with  respect  to  individual  members  of the  class,  which would  establish  incompatible \nstandards  of conduct  for  the  defendants. \n50.  This  action  is  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the  prosecution  of \nseparate  actions  would  create  a  risk  of adjudications  with  respect  to  individual  members  of the  class \nthat would,  as  a  practical  matter,  be  dispositive  of the  interests  of the  other members  who  are  not \nparties  or would  substantially impair  or impede  their  ability  to  protect  their interests. \n51.  This  action  1s  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the  questions  of law \nand  fact  common  to  the  class  predominate  over  any  questions  affecting  only  individual  class \nmembers,  and  a  class  action  is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  fairly  and  efficiently \nadjudicating  the  controversy. \n52.  As  a  direct  result  of the  policy  or practice  as  described  above,  class  members  have \nbeen  subjected  to  unlawful  strip  searches,  which  have  caused  each  member  of the  class  to  endure \nemotional  distress,  humiliation,  and  degradation. \nVI.  CLAIM \nCount  One:  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983,  Fourth  and  Fourteenth Amendments \n53.  The  above  paragraphs  are  incorporated  herein. \n54.  Sheriff Ashe  was  the  chief executive  officer  of the  Hampden  County  Sheriff's \nDepartment.  He  created  and  implemented  the  movement  and  strip  search  policies  at  the  WCC. \n55.  Sheriff Ashe  knew  or recklessly  disregarded  that  male  guards  were  routinely viewing \nand  videotaping  female  inmates  being  strip  searched,  in  non-emergency  situations,  in  violation  of\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  10  of  11 \nthe  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  He  had  an  obligation  to  correct  this \npractice  so  that it would  conform  to  the  Constitution. \n56.  Assistant  Superintendent Murphy was  responsible  for  supervision  and  overall \noperations  of the  WCC.  She  created  and  implemented  the  movement  and  strip  search  policies  at  the \nWCC. \n57.  Assistant  Superintendent Murphy  knew  or  recklessly  disregarded  that  male  guards \nwere  routinely  viewing  and  videotaping  female  inmates  being  strip  searched,  in  non-emergency \nsituations,  in  violation  of the  Fourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  She  had  an \nobligation  to  correct  this  practice  so  that it would  conform  to  the  Constitution. \n58.  By  allowing  the  practice  of routine  male  viewing  and  filming  of naked  women  being \nstrip  searched  to  continue  during  the  class  period,  Defendants  Ashe  and  Murphy  acted  with  reckless \nindifference  to  the  constitutional  rights  of individuals  who  were  held  at  the  WCC  as  described \nabove. \n59.  Well  before  the  class  period,  the  law was  clearly  established  that  routine  male \nviewing  of naked  female  prisoners,  in  the  absence  of an  emergency,  violates  the  Constitution.  By  the \nactions  described  above,  Defendants  deprived  the  named  plaintiffs  and  members  of the  plaintiff \nclass  of their  clearly  established  right,  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  of the  United  States,  to  be  free \nfrom  unreasonable  searches. \n60.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of this  conduct,  plaintiffs  and  the  plaintiff class  have \nsuffered  injuries  as  described  above. \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs  request  that  this  Court: \n(a)  Award  compensatory  damages  and  punitive  damages  to  the  named  plaintiffs  and  to \nmembers  of the  plaintiff class; \n(b)  Award  plaintiffs  the  costs  of this  action  including  reasonable  attorneyโs  fees;  and \n10\nCase  3:11-cv-30223-MAP  Document1  Filed  09/15/11  Page  11  of  11 \n(c)  Award whatever  additional  relief this  Court  deems  necessary  and  appropriate. \nVII.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n      \nDEBRA BAGGETT, ET AL.,   )\nPlaintiffs )\n)\nv. )  C.A. No. 11-cv-30223-MAP\n    )\nMICHAEL J. ASHE, JR., ET AL., )\nDefendants      )\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING\nPLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\n(Dkt. No. 41)\nMay 23, 2013\nPONSOR, U.S.D.J.\nPlaintiff Debra Baggett was a prisoner at the Western\nMassachusetts Regional Womenโs Correctional Center (โWCCโ)\nfrom September 5 through 12, 2008, and again from October 2,\n2008, through January 28, 2010.  While in custody, Plaintiff\nwas taken to the Segregation Unit and strip searched during\nthe transfer, a process which, pursuant to WCC policy, is\nvideotaped by a corrections officer.  Plaintiff has brought\nthis putative class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and\n1988 and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution, contending that Defendantsโ policy of\npermitting male correctional officers to videotape strip\nsearches of the female inmates in non-emergency situations\nviolated her constitutional rights.  \n\nBefore the court now is Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class\nCertification, seeking to certify a class of approximately\n178 former and current WCC inmates who were videotaped by\nmale correctional officers during strip searches.    \nThe 178 potential class members satisfy the numerosity\nrequirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Plaintiffโs claims\nraise questions of both law and fact common to the class,\nspecifically (1) whether Defendants maintained a policy or\ncustom of authorizing males to videotape strip searches of\nfemale prisoners in non-emergency situations and, if this\noccurred, (2) whether this policy violated the Fourth\nAmendment.  Rule 23(a)(2).  Plaintiffโs claims and defenses,\nsince she contends that she herself was a subject of the\npolicy, are obviously typical of the claims and defenses of\nthe class, as required by Rule 23(a)(3).  Furthermore,\nPlaintiff as the representative party, along with her very\nwell qualified attorneys, will adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.  Rule 23(a)(4).  \nFinally, as required by Rule 23(b)(3), a class action\nin this case is the superior method for resolving the common\nquestions of law and fact that exist.  Differences in the\nspecific circumstances of individual class members may\naffect entitlement to damages, but do not affect the\nanalysis of the propriety of as class action.  See Tyler v.\n2\n\nSuffolk County, 253 F.R.D. 8, 11 (D. Mass. 2008) (certifying\na class because the existence of divergent damages among\nclass members is not an obstacle where a โโsufficient\nconstellationโ of common questions predominatesโ). \nDefendantsโ opposition raises several arguments that\nmay be pertinent to the ultimate resolution of the case on\nthe merits, but are unpersuasive on the issue of class\ncertification.  Defendants assert that Plaintiff has failed\nto meet her burden under Rule 23(a), as established by the\nSupreme Court in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct.\n2541, 2551 (2011), of affirmatively demonstrating the\nexistence of the four elements for class certification. \nHowever, the Affidavit of David Milton (Dkt. No. 43) in\nsupport of Plaintiffsโ motion offers sufficient proof of the\nfact that the four elements are met to satisfy the standard\nas articulated in Wal-Mart.  Also, Defendants refute the\nexistence of a commonality of issues because Defendants\nallege that they had several different policies in place for\nthe transfer of prisoners into the Segregation Unit during\nthe class period.  However, the minor variations in the\napplicable policies do not make certification improper. \nAccording to Plaintiff, none of the polices limited\nvideotaping of strip searches by male correctional officers\nto emergency situations alone; this is what she challenges.\n3\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class\nCertification (Dkt. No. 41) is hereby ALLOWED.  The pretrial\nphase of the case will continue to unfold, under the\nsupervision of Magistrate Judge Kenneth P. Neiman, in\naccordance with the revised scheduled order entered on\nJanuary 9, 2013 (Dkt. No. 36), as modified by the partiesโ\njoint motion (Dkt. No. 72), adopted by the court on April\n30, 2013.\nIt is So Ordered. \n/s/ Michael A. Ponsor          \nMICHAEL A. PONSOR\nU. S. District Judge\n4\n4",
