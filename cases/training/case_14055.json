The plaintiffs challenged the legality of NSA's Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) as violating their free speech and privacy rights as well as the Separation of Powers doctrine. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, asked the court for declaratory judgment and permanent injunction.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that their regular conduct (e.g., journalism, the practice of law, and scholarship) have been impaired by the TSP, which violated various portions of the U.S. Constitution. The NSA countered that the plaintiffs: (1) lacked standing; and (2) could not establish a prima facie case without the use of state secrets, so that the state secret privilege barred plaintiffs' claims. </p><p>On August 17, 2006, the District Court (Judge Anna Diggs Taylor) disagreed with most of the NSA's arguments, and issued a judgment and permanent injunction order: (1) the TSP violated the Separation of Powers doctrine, the Administrative Procedures Act, the First and Fourth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; and (2) the NSA was enjoined from utilizing the TSP including conducting wireless wiretaps of telephone and internet communication, as violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Title III. The plaintiffs' data-mining claims were denied. The same day, the NSA filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.</p><p>The 6th Circuit stayed the operation of the the district court's injunction, 467 F.3d 590 (6th Cir., Oct. 4, 2006) and then on July 6, 2007, vacated the District Court's order and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals found that the plaintiffs lacked standing.  493 F.3d 644 (6th Cir. 2007).  On March 3, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari review. 552 U.S. 1179.</p>",

Page 2\n_________________\nOPINION\n_________________\nALICE M. BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.  The United States National Security Agency\n(“NSA”) appeals from the decision of the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan that\ngranted summary judgment against the NSA and imposed a permanent injunction.  The plaintiffs\nare a collection of associations and individualsl ed by the American Civil Liberties Union, and they\ncross-appeal.  Because we cannot find that any of teh plaintiffs have standingf or any of their claims,\nwe must vacate the district court’s order and remand for dismissal of the entire action.\nI.\nSometime after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Bush authorized the NSA\nto begin a counter-terrorism operation that has com e to be known as t he Terrorist Surveillance\nProgram (“TSP”).  Although the specifics remain undisclosed, it has been publicly acknowledged\nthat the TSP includes the interception (i.e., wiretapping), without warrants, of telephone and email\ncommunications where one party to the communication is located outside the United States and the\nNSA has “a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the com munication is a member of al\nQaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or a member of an organization affiliated with al Qaeda, or working\nin support of al Q aeda.”  See Press Briefing by Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales and Gen. Michael\nHayden, Principal Deputy Dir. for Nat’l Intelligence (Dec. 19, 2005),  available at http://www.\nwhitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1.html (last visited July 2, 2007).1\n1\n In Hepting v. AT&T Corp., the District Court for the Northern Disritct of California collected and documented\ncertain publicly available information, which provides some background and context for the present case:\n“The New York Times disclosed the [TSP] on December 16, 2005.  (James Risen and Eric Lichthlau,B  ush Lets U.S. Spy\non Callers Without Courts, The New York Tim es (Dec 16, 2005)).  The follo wing day, President George W  Bush\nconfirmed the existence of a ‘terrorist surveillance program’ in his weekly radio address:\n‘In the weeks following the [September 11, 2001] terrorist attacks on our Nation, I authorized the\nNational Security Agency, consistent with U.S. lawa nd the Constitution, to intercept the international\ncommunications of people with known links to Al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations.  Before\nwe intercept these communications, the Government must have information that establishes a clear\nlink to these terrorist networks.’\n“[Transcript] available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051217.html (last visited July 19,\n2006).  The President also described the mechanism by which the program is authorized and reviewed:\n‘The activities I authorized are reviewed approximately every 45 days.  Each review is based on a\nfresh intelligence assessment of terrorist threats to the continuity of our Government and the threat of\ncatastrophic damage to our hom eland.  During each asses sment, previous activities under the\nauthorization are reviewed.   The review includes approval by our Nation’s top legal officials,\nincluding the Attorney General and the Counsel to the President.  I have reauthorized this program\nmore than 30 times since the September the 11th attacks, and I intend to do so for as long as our\nNation faces a continuing threat from Al Qaeda and related groups.\n‘The NSA’s activities under this authorizationa re throughly reviewed by the Justice Department and\nNSA’s top legal officials, inclu ding NSA’s General Counsel and Inspector General.  Leaders in\nCongress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this authorization and the activitiesc onducted\nunder it.  Intelligence officials involved in this activity also receive extensive training toe nsure they\nperform their duties consistent with the letter and intent of the authorization.’\n“Id.\n“Attorney General Alberto Gonzales subsequently confirmed that this program intercepts ‘contents of communications\nwhere . . . one party to the communication is outside the United States’ and the government has ‘a reasonable basis to\nconclude that one party to the communication is a member of al Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or a member of an\norganization affiliated with al Qaeda, or working in support of al Qaeda.’  [Press Briefing]  available at http://www.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 3\nThe plaintiffs in this action include journalists, academ ics, and lawyers who regularly\ncommunicate with individuals located overseas, who the plaintiffs believe are the types of people\nthe NSA suspects of being al Qaeda terrorists, affiliates, or supporters, and are therefore likely to\nbe monitored under the TSP.  From this suspicion, and the limited factual foundation in this case,\nthe plaintiffs allege that they have a “well founded be lief” that their communications are being\ntapped.  According to the plaintif fs, the NSA’s operation of the TSP — and the possibility of\nwarrantless surveillance — subjects them to conditions that constitute an irreparable harm.\nThe plaintiffs filed suit in the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking a permanent injunction\nagainst the NSA’s continuation of the TSP and a declaration that two particular aspects of the TSP\n— warrantless wiretapping and data m ining — viol ate the First and Fourth Am endments, the\nSeparation of Powers Doctrine, the Adm inistrative Procedures Act (“APA”), Title III of  the\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (“Title III”), and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nAct (“FISA”).  Both sides moved for summary judgment.  The district court dismissed the data\nmining aspect of the plaintiffs’ claim , but gr anted judgment to the plaintiffs regarding the\nwarrantless wiretapping.  See ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d 754, 782 (E.D. Mich. 2006).\nThe NSA had invoked the State Secrets Doctrine 2 to bar the discovery or adm ission of\nevidence that would “expose [confidential] matters which, in the interest of national security, should\nnot be divulged.”  See United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 10 (1953).   The NSA argued that,\nwithout the privileged inf ormation, none of the named plaintiffs could establish standing.  The\ndistrict court applied the state secrets privilege, but rejected the NSA’s argument, holding instead\nthat three publicly acknowledged facts about the TSP — (1) it eavesdrops, (2) without warrants,\n(3) on international telephone and email communications in which at least one of the parties is a\nsuspected al Qaeda affiliate — were sufficient to establish standing.3  Moreover, the district court\nwhitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1.html (last visited July 19, 2005).  The Attorney General also\nnoted, ‘This [program] is not about wiretapping everyone.  This is a very concentrated, very limited program focused\nat gaining information about our enemy.’  Id. at 5.  The President has also made a public statement, of which the court\ntakes judicial notice, that the government’s ‘international activities strictly target al Qaeda and their known affiliates,’\n‘the government does not listen to domestic phone calls without court approval’ and the government is ‘not mining or\ntrolling through the personal lives of millions of innocent Americans.’  The White House, President BushD  iscusses NSA\nSurveillance Program  (May 11, 2006), [ available at ] http://www.whitehouse.gov/n ews/releases/2006/05/\n20060511-1.html (last visited July 19, 2005).”\nHepting v. AT&T Corp., 439 F. Supp. 2d 974, 986-87 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (certain citation forms altered).\n2\n The State Secrets Doctrine has two applications:  a rule of evidentiary privilegsee, e United Statesv . Reynolds,\n345 U.S. 1, 10 (1953), and a rule of non-justiciability,  see Tenet v. Doe , 544 U.S. 1, 9 (2005).  T he present case\nimplicates only the rule of state secrets evidentiary privilege.  The rule of non-justiciability applies when the subject\nmatter of the lawsuit is itself a state secret, so the claim cannot survive.  See id. (espionage contract); Weinberger v.\nCatholic Action of Haw./Peace Educ. Project, 454 U.S. 139, 146-47 (1981) (s torage of nuclear weapons); Totten v.\nUnited States, 92 U.S. 105, 107 (1875) (espionage contract).  If litigation would necessitate admission or disclosure of\neven the existence of the secret, then the case is non-justiciable and must be dismissed on the pleadings.  Because the\ngovernment has already acknowledged the existence of the warrantless wiretapping in this case, there is no risk ofs uch\ndisclosure and the rule of non-justiciability does not appl y.  The alleged data m ining, which has not been publicly\nacknowledged, might fall within this rule.  But, under the present analysis, a decision on this matter is unnecessary.\n3\n The plaintiffs have not challenged on appeal either the invocation or the grant of the state secrets privilege\nand that issue is not before the court.  At oral argument, Judge Gilman asked the plaintiffs’ counsel if the court should\nremand for further fact-finding in support of standing.  Counsel  asserted that the plaint iffs’ injuries were clear and\nundisputed in the record and there was no need to remand for a hearing or admission of additional evidence on this issue.\nTo be sure, the parties dispute the implications of the privilege (i.e., whether the publicly available information about\nthe TSP is sufficient to establish their claims), but it would not be appropriate to inquire, sua sponte, into the propriety\nof the NSA’s invocation of the privilege, the district court’s grant of the privilege, or the scope of the privilege granted.\nThe government provided the district court an opportunity to review certain, secret documents, in camera and\nunder seal, as support for the invocation of the state secrets privilege.  The government provided each member of this\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 4\nfound these three facts sufficient to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the merits of their\nclaims, resulting in a declaratory judgment and the imposition of an injunction.  These three facts\nconstitute all the evidence in the record relating to the NSA’s conduct under the TSP.\nIn deciding the merits, the district court constured the Fourth Amendment as an absolute rule\nthat “requires prior warrants for any reasonable search,”A CLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 775, and\nannounced that “searches conducted without prior approval by a judge or magistrate were per se\nunreasonable,” id. at 771.  Having found that the NSA was operating without warrants, the district\ncourt concluded without further explanation that  President Bush had “undisputedly violated the\nFourth [Amendment] . . . and accordingly ha[d]  violated the First Am endment Rights of these\nPlaintiffs as w ell.”   Id. at 776.  Proceeding from  this conclusion, the court deem ed the TSP\nunconstitutional and issued an order enjoining its further operation entirely:\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants [i.e., NSA], its agents,\nemployees, representatives, and any other  persons or entities in active concert or\nparticipation with Defendants, are permanently enjoined from directly or indirectly\nutilizing the Terrorist Surveillance Program  (hereinaf ter ‘TSP’) in any way,\nincluding, but not lim ited to, conducting warrantless wiretaps of telephone a nd\ninternet communications, in contravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nAct (hereinafter ‘FISA’) and Title III;\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND DECLARED that the TSP violates the\nSeparation of Powers doctrine, the Adm inistrative Procedures Act, the First and\nFourth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the FISA and Title III[.]\nACLU v. NSA, E.D. Mich. Dist. Court, No. 2:06-CV-10204, “Judgment and Permanent Injunction\nOrder” (Aug. 17, 2006).  The NSA moved for a stay of the injunction pending appeal, which the\ndistrict court denied.  Meanwhile, the NSA appealde, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and\nthat the State Secrets Doctrine prevented adjudicaotin on the merits.

Based on the analysis presented herein, it is unnecessary to reach the issue of\nintervening mootness.  See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.

Citizens\nfor a Better Env’t , 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998) (stating that th ere is no “doctrine of hypothetical\njurisdiction”).  “Every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its\nown jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even [if] the parties are\nprepared to concede it . . . .

Selden, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975), and “a\nplaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press,” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v.\nCuno, 547 U.S. --, 126 S.

However,\nfor purposes of the asser ted declaratory judgm ent — though not necessarily for the requested\ninjunction6 — it is only necessary that one plaintiff has standing.  See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S.\n714, 721 (1986) (deciding a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute because at least one\nplaintiff had standing).7  The injunction in this case is predicated on the declaratory judgment (i.e.,\na determination that the NSA’s conduct is unlawful), so it follows that if the plaintiffs lack standing\nto litigate their declaratory judgment claim, they must also lack standing to pursue an injunction.\nThe question is whether any plaintiff has standing to litigate the declaratory judgment claim.\nAs for the “particular claims,” the plaintiffs have asserted six separate claims or causes of\naction — three constitutional (Fisrt Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and Separation of Powers) and\nthree statutory (APA, Title III, and FISA) 8 — and the plaintiffs must establish that at least one\n5\n On the merits of this appeal, this court is presentde with a cascade of serious questions. H  as the NSA violated\nthe United States Constitution — the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, or the Separation of Powers Doctrine?\nOr, has the NSA violatedf ederal statute — the APA, FISA, or Title III?  If the NSA has violated a federal statute, isth at\nstatute constitutional when applied to the NSA in this manner?  If the NSA has violated eithert he Constitution or a valid\nfederal statute, is an injunction justified?  And, if an injunction is justified, what is its proper scope?  The district court\nanswered all of the questions in the affirmative and imposed an injunction of the broadest possible scope.\n6\n “[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.” L aidlaw, 528 U.S. at 185\n(citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983) (notwithstanding that the plaintiff had standing to pursue\ndamages, he lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief)).\n7\n After argument on this appeal, the plaintiffs fileda  citation to supplemental authority, urging us to rely on the\nSupreme Court’s recent decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. -- , 127 S. Ct.1 438, 1453 (2007) (“Only one of the\npetitioners needs to have standing top ermit us to consider the petition for review.”).  That case, howevero, ffers no direct\nlegal support for the plaintiffs’ claim of standing because it involves a “petition for review,” a particular cause of action\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1), see id. at 1451 n.16, which has no applicability in the present case.\n8\n The plaintiffs, in the plain language of  their complaint, actually assert only one statutory cause of action,\npredicated on the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702( 2000).  They claim that the NSA violated the “substantive provisions” of FISA\nand Title III, and contend that this establishes standing for an APA cause of actione ven if they cannot establish standing\nto litigate a cause of action under either FISA’s or Title  III’s civil suit provisions (i.e., under the relevant statutes).\nBecause the APA itself has no applicability in the present circumstances, see Section IV.B.1, the plaintiffs’ references\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 6\nplaintiff has standing for each.  See Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 721; Cuno, 126 S. Ct. at 1867.  Because\na cause of action is intertwined with an injury,  the injuries being alleged m ust be described as\nprecisely and unambiguously as possible.  A particularized analysis is therefore necessary.\nThe conduct giving rise to the alleged injuries  is undisputed:  the NSA (1) eavesdrops,\n(2) without warrants, (3) on international telephon eand email communications in which at least one\nof the parties is reasonably suspected of al Qaeda ties.  The plaintiffs’ objection to this conduct is\nalso undisputed, and they demand that the NSA discontinue it.  The plaintiffs do not contend — nor\ncould they — that the m ere practice of wiretapping (i.e., e avesdropping) is, by itself,\nunconstitutional, illegal, or even improper.  Rather, the plaintiffs object to the NSA’s eavesdropping\nwithout warrants, specifically FISA warrants with their associated lim itations and minimization\nrequirements.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804-06.  Accord ing to the plaintiffs, it is the absence of  these\nwarrants that renders the NSA’s conduct illegal and unconstitutional.  But the plaintiffs do not —\nand because of the State Secrets Doctrine cannot  — produce any evidence that any of their own\ncommunications have ever been intercepted by the NSA, under the TSP, or  without warrants.\nInstead, they assert a mere belief, which they contend is reasonable and which they label a “well\nfounded belief,” that:  their overseas contacts are the types of people targeted by the NSA; the\nplaintiffs are consequently subjected to theN SA’s eavesdropping; the eavesdropping leads the NSA\nto discover (and possibly disclose) private or privileged inf ormation; and the mere possibility of\nsuch discovery (or disclosure) has injured them in three particular ways.\nNotably, the plaintiffs do not allege as injury that they personally, either as individuals or\nassociations, anticipate or fear any form of direct reprisal by the government (e.g., the NSA, the\nJustice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, etc.), such as crim inal prosecution,\ndeportation, administrative inquiry, civil litigation, ore ven public exposure.  The injuries that these\nplaintiffs allege are not so direct; they are more amorphous and necessitate a pointed description.\nThe plaintiffs’ primary alleged injury — the ifrst of three — is their inability to communicate\nwith their overseas contacts by telephone or email due to their self-governing ethical obligations.9\nUnder this claim, the immediate injury results directly from the plaintiffs’ own actions and decisions,\nbased on (1) their subjective belief that the NSA might be intercepting their communications, and\n(2) t he ethical requirem ents governing such ci rcumstances, as dictated by their respective\nprofessional organizations or affiliations.  Relying on the district court’s three facts, the plaintiffs\nallege their “well founded belief” that the NSA is intercepting their communications with overseas\ncontacts, to the perceived detriment of those overseas contacts.  The plaintiffs explain that they have\nan ethical duty to keep their communications confidential, which, under the circumstances, requires\nthat they refrain from communicating with the overseas contacts by telephone or email, lest they\nviolate that duty.10  The possibility that private com munications may be revealed burdens the\nto FISA and Title III are construed liberally in this opinion, as assertions of independent causes of action under each,\nto consider whether the plaintiffs had standing to litigate their case despite the possible inartfulness of their pleading.\n9\n This injury, as alleged, actually appears to implicate the Fifth or Sixth Amendments, see, e.g., United States\nv. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 270 (1967) (Brennan, J., concurring) (quoting Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 492 (1959))\n(stating that “the right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable\ngovernmental interference comes within the ‘liberty’ and ‘property’ concepts of the Fifth Am endment”); Sinclair v.\nSchriber, 916 F.2d 1109, 1112-13 (6th Cir. 199 0) (describing “a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nensuing from government surveillance”); Berlin Democratic Club v. Rumsfeld, 410 F. Supp. 144, 161-62 (D.D.C. 1976)\n(considering an alleged violation of the Sixth Amendment due to “electronic surveillance of conversations between his\nattorney and a consultant”), but the plaintiffs have not asserted these causes of action.\n10\n Some plaintiffs appear to describe this injurya s an untenable choice, in which they must decide between their\n“professional duty” (i.e., completing the job) and complying with their ethical duties.  Even accepting, arguendo, that\nthese plaintiffs are bound by these duties, this description  is incorrect.  While these circumstances demand that the\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 7\nplaintiffs’ pursuit of their chosenp rofessions or organizational objectives — i.e., in order to comply\nwith their ethical duties, the plaintiffs must refrain from communicating by telephone or email, and\nare instead required either to travel overseas to meet with these contacts in person or else refrain\nfrom communicating with them altogether.  The injury manifests itself in both a quantifiable way\n(as the added time and expense of traveling overesas) and a non-quantifiable way (as the incomplete\nor substandard performance of their professional responsibilities and obligations).  The plaintiffs\nalleged this injury in their complaint and again on appeal, even though it went unaddressed by the\ndistrict court.\nThe second alleged injury — and the only one expressly addressed by the district court —\nis the “chilling effect” on the overseas contacts’ willingness to communicate with the plaintiffs by\ntelephone or email.  Under this claim, the immediate injury results directly from the actions of the\noverseas contacts who, the plaintiffs contend, feart hat the NSA’s discovery of otherwise private or\nprivileged information (being communicated by telephone or email) will lead to some direct reprisal\nby the United States government, their own governments, or others.  This fear causes the overseas\ncontacts to refuse to com municate with the plaintiffs by telephone or em ail, and this refusal to\ncommunicate burdens the plaintiffs in the perform ance of their jobs or other  lawful objectives,\nbecause, in order to pursue their chosen profession sor organizational objectives, the plaintiffs must\ntravel overseas to meet with these contacts in person.  This injury manifests itself as both an added\nexpense and an added burden.\nThe plaintiffs’ third alleged injury is the NSA’s violation of their legitimate expectation of\nprivacy in their overseas telephone and email communications.  Under this claim, the immediate\ninjury comes directly from the actions of the NSA.  The plaintiffs assert that the Fourth Amendment,\nTitle III, and FISA limit the occasions and circumstances in which, and the manner by which, the\ngovernment can lawfully intercept overseas electronic communications, giving rise to a legitimate\nexpectation that their overseas communications will be intercepted only in accordance with these\nlimits.  The plaintiffs conclude that, because the NSA has conducted foreign electronic surveillance\nwithout obtaining FISA warrants (and presumably, without strict adherence to FISA’s minimization\nrequirements), the NSA has breached their legitimate expectation of privacy, thereby causing them\ninjury.  The plaintiffs alleged a violation of their privacy rights in their complaint, but the district\ncourt did not mention it and they have not pressed it on appeal.11\nThis third kind of injury, unlike the other two, is direct and personal; under this theory, the\nNSA has directly invaded the plaintiffs’ interest and proof of such invasion is all that is necessary\nto establish standing.  If, for instance, a plaintiff could demonstrate that her privacy had actually\nbeen breached (i.e., that her communications had actually been wiretapped), then she would have\nstanding to assert a Fourth Amendment cause of action for breach of privacy1.2  In the present case,\nthe plaintiffs concede that there is no single plaintiff who can show that he or she has actually been\nwiretapped.  Moreover, due to the State Secrets Docrtine, the proof needed either to make or negate\nplaintiffs comply with both obligations, this dual compliance is “tenable”; compliance with both obligationsw  ill simply\nbe more costly, time consuming, and burdensome.  The obligations are not conflicting or mutually exclusive.  The \nchoice is actually between paying the cost oft his dual compliance or not completing the job, and therefore, the “injury”\nis the added cost of completing the job, in compliance with the ethical duties, under the present circumstances.\n11\n At oral argument, the plaintiffs’ counsel conceded that it would be unprecedented for a court to find standing\nfor a person to litigate a Fourth Amendment cause of action without any evidence that the defendant (i.e., government)\nhad actually subjected that particular person to an illegals earch or seizure.  The plaintiffs’ briefs are nott o the contrary.\n12\n As will be discussed in Section IV.A.1, however, she could not — under this scenario — establish standing\nto litigate a First Amendment cause of action.  See Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 10 (1972) (holding that standing is not\nsatisfied “by a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his First Amendment rights is being chilled by the mere\nexistence, without more, of a governmental investigative and data-gathering activity”).\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 8\nsuch a showing is privileged, and thereforew  ithheld from discovery or disclosure. S ee Tenenbaum\nv. Simonini, 372 F.3d 776, 777 (6th Cir. 2004) (upholding dsimissal because the defendants “cannot\ndefend their conduct . . . without revealing the privileged information [so] the state secrets doctrine\nthus deprives [the d]efendants of a valid defense to the [plaintiff]s’ claims”).  This injury is not\nconcrete or imminent under these circumstances, and this opinion focuses on the plaintiffs’ two other\nalleged injuries.\nOne other issue demands attention, namely, that the plaintiffs’ failure to subject themselves\nto actual harm does not, by itself, prevent a finding that they have standing — specifically, it does\nnot deprive them of the right to seek declaratory judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) (empowering\ncourts to “declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such\ndeclaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought”).  Implicit in each of the plaintiffs’\nalleged injuries is the underlyingp ossibility — which the plaintiffs label a “well founded belief” and\nseek to treat as a probability or even a certainty — that the NSA is presently intercepting, or will\neventually intercept, communications to or from one or more of these particular plaintiffs, and that\nsuch interception would be detrimental to the plaintiffs’ clients, sources, or overseas contacts.  This\nis the premise upon which the plaintiffs’ entire theor yis built.  But even though the plaintiffs’ beliefs\n— based on t heir superior knowledge of thei r contacts’ activities — m ay be reasonable,13 the\nalternative possibility remains that the NSA m ight not be intercepting, and might never actually\nintercept, any communication by any of the plaintiffs named in this lawsuit.\nA plaintiff’s refusal to engage in potentially harmful activities is the typical substance of a\ndeclaratory judgment action and does not, by itselfp, reclude a finding that the plaintiff has standing.\nSee MedImmune, Inc. v. G enetech, Inc., 549 U.S. -- , 127 S. Ct. 764, 772-73 (2007).  But it is\nimportant to distinguish the two harms that surround a declaratory judgment action.  The anticipated\nharm that causes one to ref rain from the activities may satisfy the “injury-in-fact” element of\nstanding if it is sufficiently imminent and concrete.  For reasons that will be made clear in the\nanalysis, the other harm  — the harm  that results from refraining from the potentially harm ful\nactivities — is another m atter.  In the present  case, the plaintif fs anticipate that the NSA’s\ninterception of telephone and email communications might be detrimental to their overseas contacts,\nand this perceived harm causes the plaintiffs to refrain from that communication (i.e., potentially\nharmful activity).  Because there is no evidence that any plaintiff’s communications have ever been\nintercepted, and the state secrets privilege prevents discovery of such evidence, see Reynolds, 345\nU.S. at 10, there is no proof that interception would be detrimental to the plaintiffs’ contacts, and\nthe anticipated harm  is neither im minent nor  concrete — it  is hypothetical, conjectural, or\nspeculative.  Ther efore, this harm  cannot satisfy the “injury in fact” requirem ent of standing.\nBecause the plaintiffs cannot avoid this shortcoming, they do not propose this harm — the harm that\ncauses their refusal to communicate — as an “injury” that warrants redress.  Instead, they propose\nthe injuries that r esult from their refusal to communicate and those injuries do appear imminent and\nconcrete.\nThus, in crafting their declaratory judgm ent action, the plaintiffs have attem pted\n(unsuccessfully) to navigate the obstacles to stating a justiciable claim .  By r efraining from\ncommunications (i.e., the potentially harmful conduct), the plaintiffs have negated any possibility\nthat the NSA will ever actuallyi ntercept their communications and thereby avoided the anticipated\nharm — this is typical of declaratory judgment and perfectly permissible.  See MedImmune, 127 S.\nCt. at 772-73.  But, by propos ing only injuries that  result f rom this ref usal to engage in\ncommunications (e.g., the inability to conduct theipr rofessions without added burden and expense),\n13\n Note that a legal determination of objective reasonableness would require additional specific information\nabout the mechanics of the TSP, such as the number of communications being intercepted, the percentage of the total\nthat number represents, the actual selection and screening process, the actual retention, dissemination, and disclosure\npolicy, etc.  This information is unavailable due to the State Secrets Doctrine.  See Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 10.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 9\nthey attempt to supplant14 an insufficient, speculative injury with an injury that appears sufficiently\nimminent and concrete, but is only incidental to the alleged wrong (i.e., the NSA’s conduct) — this\nis atypical and, as will be discussed, impermissible.\nTherefore, the injury that would support a declaratory judgment action (i.e., the anticipated\ninterception of communications resulting in harm to the contacts) is too speculative, and the injury\nthat is imminent and concrete (i.e., the burde n on professional performance) does not support a\ndeclaratory judgment action.  This general proposition — the doctrine of standing — is explained\nmore fully in the sections of the analysis regarding each, individual cause of action.\nIII.\nBy claiming six causes of action, the plaintiffs  have actually engaged in a thinly veiled,\nthough perfectly acceptable, ruse.  To call a spa de a spade, the plaintiffs have only one claim ,\nnamely, breach of privacy, based ona  purported violation of the Fourth Amendment or FISA — i.e.,\nthe plaintiffs do not want the NSA listening to their phone calls or reading their em ails.  That is\nreally all there is to it.  On a straightforwar d reading, this claim  does not im plicate the First\nAmendment.15  The problem with asserting only a breach-of-pri vacy claim is that, because the\nplaintiffs cannot show that they have been or will be subjected to surveillance  personally, they\nclearly cannot establish standing under the Fourth Amendment or FISA.16  The plaintiffs concede\nas much.17  In an attempt to avoid this problem, the plaintiffs have recast their injuries as a matter\nof free speech and association, characterized their calim as a violation of the First Amendment, and\n14\n To clarify:  If the plaintiffs and their overseas  contacts were to proceed with the telephone and em ail\ncommunications, in disregard of the TSP (thereby incurring no additional cost, burden, or diminution of professional\nperformance), and none of their communications were ever actually intercepted by the NSA, then there would be no\ninjury to these plaintiffs due to the NSA’s conduct.  Undetrh is scenario, even if the NSA, unbeknownst to the plaintiffs,\ndid intercept a communication, there would be no tangible injury until the NSA disclosed the information (presumably\nin a manner demonstrating a direct injury to the plaintiffs or their contacts).  Therefore, it is only by refraining from the\ncommunications that the plaintiffs can transmute a speculative future injury into an actual present injury.\n15\n See Gordon v. Warren Consol. Bd. of Educ. , 706 F.2d 778, 781 n.3 (6th Cir. 1983) (explaining that\nsurveillance, which falls under the Fourth Amendment, “does not violate First Amendment rights, even though it may\nbe directed at communicative or associative activities”).  The First Amendment protects public speech and the free\nexchange of ideas, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992), while the Fourth Amendment protects citizens from\nunwanted intrusion into their personal lives and effects, Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967).  Otherwise\nstated, the First Amendment protects one’s right to associate and be heard, while the Fourth Amendment protects the\nright to remain unheard.  The First Amendment protects one’s posting of a sign in her front yard, while the Fourth\nAmendment protects her hiding of the same sign in her basement.\n16\n See Section IV.A.2 (citing Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 133-34 (1978) (“Fourth Amendment rights are\npersonal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.”))  and Section IV.B.3\n(citing H.R. Rep. No. 95-1283, at 66 (1978) (Report by thPee rmanent Select Comm. on Intel., in support of the proposed\nFISA bill and amendments) (“[T]he term [aggrieved person] is intended to be coextensive [with], but no broader than,\nthose persons who have standing tor aise claims under the Fourth Amendment with respect to electronic surveillance.”)).\n17\n At oral argument, the plaintiffs’ counsel conceded that it would be unprecedented for a court to find standing\nfor a person to litigate a Fourth Amendment cause of action without any evidence that the defendant (i.e., government)\nhad actually subjected that particular person to an illegal searcho r seizure.  The plaintiffs’ briefs are not to the contrary.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 10\nengaged the First Amendment’s relaxed rules on standing1.8  This argument is not novel, but neither\nis it frivolous; it warrants consideration, analysis, and an a full explanation by this court.\nAt this point, it becomes apparent that my analysis of whether the plaintiffs have standing\ndiverges at a fundamental level from that of the concurring and dissenting opinions.  They each\nemploy a single, broad, all-encompassing analysis, with which they attempt to account for all of the\nplaintiffs’ alleged injuries, requested remedies, and legal claims.  As much as I would prefer that\nresolution of this question were so simple, I believe the law demands a particularized analysis of the\nplaintiffs’ three alleged injuries, six asserted legal claims, and two requested forms of relief.  See\nCuno, 126 S. Ct. at 1867 (“[A] pl aintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim  he seeks to\npress.”); Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 185 (“[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form\nof relief sought.”).  Therefore, I believe the complexity of this case calls for a far more specific and\ncomprehensive analysis than that offered by my colleagues.\nA comprehensive analysis of all six claim s in a single opi nion, however, invites som e\noverlap of legal doctrine, precedent, and reasoni ng.  Such overlap sim ilarly invites ambiguity,\nconfusion, and misapplication.  To avodi this pitfall, I define the planitiffs’ alleged injuries precisely,\nconfine each cause of action to its own section, and take special care to ensure that I do not\nimproperly carry precedent or legal doctrine from one cause of action to another.  The benefit of\nprecision will, I hope, outweigh any annoyance cr eated by strict com partmentalization or\nredundancy.\nIV.\nThe analytical approach to the determination of standing for constitutional claims differs\nfrom the approach to statutory claims.  See Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 731-32 (1972).\nWhether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to\nobtain judicial resolution of that controversy is what has traditionally been referred\nto as the question of standing to sue.  Where the party does not rely on any specific\nstatute authorizing invoc ation of the judi cial process, the question of standing\ndepends upon whether the party has allegeds uch a personal stake in the outcome of\nthe controversy, as to ensure that the dispute sought to be adjudi cated will be\npresented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of\njudicial resolution.  Where, however, Congress has authorized public officials to\nperform certain functions according to law, and has provided by statute for judicial\nreview of those actions under certain circumstances, the inquiry as to standing must\nbegin with a determination of whether the sattute in question authorizes review at the\nbehest of the plaintiff.\nId. (quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Court clarified:\nCongress may not confer jurisdiction on Art. III federal courts to render advisory\nopinions, or to entertain ‘friendly’ suits, or to resolve ‘political questions,’ because\nsuits of this character are inconsistent with the judicial function under Art. III.  But\nwhere a dispute is otherwise justiciable,t he question whether the litigant is a ‘proper\n18\n See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 445 n.5 (1972) (“Indeed, in First Amendment cases we have\nrelaxed our rules of standing without regard to the relationship between the litigant and those whose rights he seeks to\nassert precisely because application of thoser ules would have an intolerable, inhibitory effect on freedom of speech.”);\nMetromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 546-47 (1981) (“The most important exception to this standing\ndoctrine permits some litigants to challenge on First Amendment grounds laws that may validly be applied against them\nbut which may, because of their unnecessarily broad reach, inhibit the protected speech of third parties.”).\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am.

Constitutional Claims\n“The irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three requirem ents”:  “[1]\ninjury in fact, [2] causation, and [3] redressability.”   Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 102-03 (citations and\nfootnotes omitted).  “Injury in fact” is a harm suffered by the plaintiff that is “concrete and actual\nor imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”I d . at 103 (quotation marks omitted) (citing Whitmore\nv.

This\n“irreducible constitutional minimum” applies to every claim sought to be litigated in federal court.\n1.  First Amendment\nThe plaintiffs allege that the NSA has, byc onducting the warrantless wiretaps, violated the\nfree speech and free association clauses of the First Amendment.  The district court assumed that\nthe plaintiffs had engaged in certain “protected expression,” apparently referring to the telephone\nand em ail com munications.  Although the plaintiffs’ painstaking efforts to keep these\ncommunications confidential belies thec ontention that this case involvese xpression,20 I nonetheless\nassume this is a viable First Amendment cause of action.  Standing to litigate this claim requires a\nshowing of three elements:  (1) injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability.  Steel Co., 523\nU.S. at 102-03.\n19\n Sierra Club twice acknowledges that courts reach this analysis only where it is determ ined that th e\ncontroversy at issue is “otherwise justiciable.”   Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at 731-32.  Justiciability, of course, includes\nnumerous doctrines, including mootness, standing, the prohibition on advisory opinions, and the political question\ndoctrine.  See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95 (1968).  Sierra Club’s use of the term “otherwise justiciable” thus refers\nto the doctrines of justiciability “other” than standing.  Assuming that these other justiciability doctrines are satisfied,\nSierra Club distinguishes between standing analysis for statutory and non-statutory claims.  For non-statutory claims,\nwhich include the constitutional claim s at issue here,  Sierra Club requires the plaintiffs to show that they have a\n“personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.”  Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at 732.  The Court used this “personal stake\nin the outcome” language to define Article III standing prior to its adoption of the three-part test in Lujan v. Defenders\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  But the standing analysis is different for statutory claims.  Sierra Club instructs\ncourts that “the inquiry as to standing m ust begin with a determination of whether the statute in question authorizes\nreview at the behest of the plaintiff.” S ierra Club, 405 U.S. at 732.  This instruction to begin standinga nalysis with the\nstatutory language makes perfect sense in light of the welle-stablished legal principle that “Congress may enact statutes\ncreating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standi ng, even though no injury would exist without the statute.”\nLinda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 n.3 (1973); see also Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41\nn.22 (1976), (recognizing “Congress’ power to create new interests the invasion of which will confer standing”).  Thus\nthe analysis of whether the plaintiffs have standing to bring a statutory claim necessarily requires a determination of\nwhether the plaintiffs were injured under the relevant statute.\n20\n There is, in fact, a certainv iew that this is not a First Amendment issue at all. S ee Gordon v. Warren Consol.\nBd. of Educ., 706 F.2d 778, 781 n.3 (6th Cir. 1983) (noting that surveillance, which falls under the Fourth Amendment,\n“does not violate First Amendment rights, even though it may be directed at communicative or associative activities”).\nUltimately, however, this distinction is a merits issue that I need not — and indeed cannot — address at this stage.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 12\nInjury in Fact\n“Art. III requires the party who invokes the court’s authority to show that he personally has\nsuffered some actual or threatened injury as  a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the\ndefendant.”  Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Sep. of Church & State, Inc,. 454 U.S.\n464, 472 (1982) (quotation marks omitted).  “Allegations of a subjective ‘chill’ are not an adequate\nsubstitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm[.]”  Laird\nv. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1972).  The Suprem e Court’s “clear precedent requir[es] that the\nallegations of future injury be particular and concrete.”  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 109.\nThe Supreme Court framed the question inL aird, 408 U.S. at 10, as “whether the jurisdiction\nof a federal court m ay be invoked by a complainant who alleges that the exercise of his First\nAmendment rights[21] is being chilled by the m ere existence, without m ore, of a governmental\ninvestigative and data-gathering activity.”  The Court held that its plaintiffs, subjects of s ecret\nUnited States Arm y surveillance, m ay have suf fered a “subjective chill,” but did not allege a\nsufficiently concrete, actual, and imminent injury to entitle them to standing.  Id. at 15.  Something\n“more” was necessary, and in a passage that is peculiarly applicable to the present case, the Court\nexplained:\nIn recent years [we have] found in a number of cases that constitutional violations\nmay arise from the deterrent, or ‘chilling,’ effect of governmental regulations that\nfall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights.  In\nnone of these cases, however, did the chilling e ffect arise m erely from  the\nindividual’s knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities\nor from the individual’s concom itant fear that, arm ed with the fruits of those\nactivities, the agency m ight in the future take som e other and additional action\ndetrimental to that individual.  Rather, i neach of these cases, the challenged exercise\nof governmental power was regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature, and\nthe complainant was either pres ently or prospectively subject to the regulations,\nproscriptions, or compulsions that he was challenging.\nId. at 11 (citations om itted; emphasis added);  accord Sinclair, 916 F.2d at 1114-15 (finding\nsurveillance alone insufficient for standing); United Presb. Church v. Reagan, 738 F.2d 1375, 1380\n(D.C. Cir. 1984) (finding no injuryi n fact because “no part of the challenged [surveillance] imposes\nor even relates to any direct governmental constraint upon the plaintiffs”).\nI cannot subscribe to a view that the reason the injury inL  aird was insufficient was because\nthe plaintiffs alleged “only” chilled speech and that, by something “more,” the Laird Court meant\nmore subjective injury or other injuries that derive from the chilled speech.  The plaintiffs in Laird\nwere political activists and the speech being chilled was political speech.  Laird, 408 U.S. at 2.  In\nFirst Amendment jurisprudence, political speech is the most valued type of speech.  See R.A.V. v.\nCity of St. Paul , 505 U.S. 377, 422 (1992) (Ste vens, J., concurring) (“Our First Am endment\ndecisions have created a rough hierarchy in the constitutional protection of speech.  Core political\nspeech occupies the highest, most protected position. . . .”).  To sayt hat there could be more injury\nin other circumstances is to suggest that political speech is not valuable in and of itself and that no\nconsequences flow from  the chilling of political  speech if such consequences ar e not easily\narticulable.  Certain plaintiffs in the present case contend that the “professional injuries” that flow\nfrom the chilling of their “professional” speech is enough to satisfy  Laird’s requirement of\nsomething “more.”  Under such reasoning, if the  Laird plaintiffs had alleged a chilling of some\n21\n Laird involved a First Amendment claim.  I do not assert or imply that Laird’s holding, which I narrowly\nconstrue as regarding only a subjective chill on First Amendment rights, extends to any other causes of action.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 13\ncommercial speech, they would have had standing because the lost sales would constitute easily\narticulable injuries resulting f rom the chilli ng, which would — under th is view — constitute\nsomething “more.”  This is nonsense, as it would effectively value com mercial speech above\npolitical speech and protect the former but not the latter.  It is also at odds with the remainder of the\nLaird opinion and First Amendment doctrine in general.  Consequently, it is not the value of the\nspeech that determines the injury but the level of restraint, and “chilling” is not sufficient restraint\nno matter how valuable the speech.\nTherefore, to allege a sufficient injury under teh First Amendment, a plaintiff must establish\nthat he or she is regulated, constrained, or compelled directly by the government’s actions, instead\nof by his or her own subjective chill.  Laird, 408 U.S. at 11; Reagan, 738 F.2d at 1378.  The D.C.\nCircuit’s decision in Reagan, 738 F.2d at 1380, involved a plaintiff’s First Amendment challenge\nto alleged government surveillance.  The Reagan court clarified why mere subjective chill deriving\nfrom government surveillance is insufficient to establish a concrete injury, stating:\nThe harm of ‘chilling effect’ is to be di stinguished from the immediate threat of\nconcrete, harmful action.  The former consists of present deterrence [of the plaintiff,\nby the government,] from First Amendment conduct because of the difficulty [that\nplaintiff has in] determ ining the application of a [governm ent practice] to that\nconduct, and will not by itself support standing.\nId.  “‘Chilling effect’ is cited as the reason why the governmental imposition is invalid [under the\nFirst Amendment] rather than as the harm which entitles the plaintiffs to challenge it.”  Id. at 1378.\nIn an attempt to establish harm, the Reagan plaintiffs claimed that they were “especially likely to\nbe targets of the unlawful [surveillance] authorized by the order,” but the court explained:\nEven if it were conceded that . . . the plaintiffs [were] at greater risk than the public\nat large, that would still fall far short of the ‘genuine threat’ required to support this\ntheory of standing, as opposed to mere ‘speculative’ harm.  It must be borne in mind\nthat this order does not  direct intelligence-gathering activities against all persons\nwho could conceivably come within its scope, but merely authorizes them.\nId. at 1380 (citations omitted).  The Reagan court therefore held that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy\nthe injury-in-fact requirement because they did no tallege that “any direct governmental constraint”\nwas “threatened or even contemplated against them.”  Id.  The present case is no different.\nThe plaintiffs here contend that the NSA has inflicted First Amendment injury in two ways,\nboth of which prevent them from performing their jobs or pursuing other lawful objectives.  The first\ninjury, which went unaddressed by the district court, involves the plaintiffs’ own unwillingness to\ncommunicate with their overseas contacts by telephone or email.  The plaintiffs fear that the NSA\nmay intercept their communications, and therefore, their ethical obligations require them to forgo\nthe communications in order to a void interception.  The injurious consequence of the NSA’s\nconduct, the plaintiffs contend, is that they must either suffer diminished performance in their jobs\nfor lack of communication, or else bear the cost of traveling overseas to meet with these contacts\nin person.\nEven accepting this as a good faith assertion and assuming the factual statements are true,\nthe plaintiffs’ first injury still involves two purelys peculative fears:  (1) that the NSA will actually\nintercept the plaintiffs’  particular communications, and (2) that arm ed with the fruit of those\ninterceptions, the NSA will take action detrim ental to the contacts.  If , on the other hand, the\nplaintiffs could be assured tha tthe NSA would not intercept their communications, or, if interception\noccurs, that no harm would befall the overseas contacts, then the NSA could continue the TSP\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 14\nwiretapping without harm to the plaintiffs. 22  It is not the m ere existence of the TSP, but the\npossibility that the plaintiffs’ overseas contacts will be subjected to it, that ultimately results in the\nalleged harm.  Even assuming these fears are imminent rather than speculative, this is still a tenuous\nbasis for proving a concrete and actual injury.  That is, even if it were certain that the NSA would\nintercept these particular plaintiffs’ overseas com munications, if the overseas cont acts were\nnonetheless willing to com municate with the plaintiffs by telephone or em ail in spite of the\nimpending interception, then it is doubtful that the plaintiffs (journalists, academ ics, lawyers, or\norganizations), who have themselves alleged no personal fear of our government (or basis for fear\nof our governm ent), would still be unwilling or unable to com municate.  The pl aintiffs’\nunwillingness comes not from any anticipated harm to themselves, but from their apprehension for\nand duty to their overseas contacts.23\nMoreover, even if  their allegations are true, the plaintif fs still allege only a subjective\napprehension and a personal (self-imposed) unwillingness to communicate, which fall squarely\nwithin Laird, 408 U.S. at 13-14.  In fact, this injury is even less concrete, actual, or immediate than\nthe injury in Laird.  In Laird, the Army was conducting “massive and comprehensive” surveillance\nof civilians, secretly and (apparently) without warrants.  The Laird plaintiffs alleged that the Army\nsurveillance program caused a chilling effect on theirF  irst Amendment rights in that they and others\nwere reluctant to associate or communicate for fear of reprisal, stemming from their fear that the\ngovernment would discover or had disc overed them (and their activities) by way of the secret\nsurveillance.  The harm alleged in the present case is no more substantial; the plaintiffs allege a\nsimilar chilling effect on their First Amendment rights, in that they are bound by professional and\nethical obligations to refrain from communicating with their overseas contacts due to their fear that\nthe TSP surveillance will lead to discovery, exposuer, and ultimately reprisal against those contacts\nor others.  But  unlike the Laird plaintiffs, the plaintiffs here do not assert that they personally\nanticipate or fear any direct reprisal by the UnitedS  tates government, or that the TSP data is being\nwidely circulated or misused.  Indeed, the district court stated that, to date, no one has been exposed\nor prosecuted based on information collected under the TSP. A CLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 771.\nThe plaintiffs attempt to distinguish  Laird.  They first contend that they have all eged a\nchilling of their own communications, whereas the Laird plaintiffs did not.  But theL aird plaintiffs\nalleged the same amount (or lack) of personalized surveillance as the present plaintiffs claim, and\nboth alleged a chilling o ftheir own communications.  Even if this distinction were accurate, it would\nnot alter  Laird’s holding that federal courts lack jurisdiction over cases in which the pla intiff\n“alleges that the exercise of  his First Amendment rights is being chilled by the m ere existence,\nwithout more, of a governmental investigative and data-gathering activity.”  Laird, 408 U.S. at 10.\nThe plaintiffs next argue that they have alleged a present injury, namely, an inability to engage in\nthe communication necessary to perform their professional duties, whereas the plaintiffs in Laird\nalleged only a speculative future harm.  But the injury alleged here is just as attenuated as the ufture\n22\n As discussed in Section II, this scenario could result in a breach of the plaintiffs’ privacy under the Fourth\nAmendment, but the present analysisc oncerns only the First Amendment cause of action.  The Fourth Amendment, and\nharms attributable to a defendant’s breach of its protections, necessitate a different analysis.  See Section IV.A.2.\n23\n The plaintiffs who are lawyers take this argument one step further, alleging that their concerns render them\nincapable of communicating with their clients and others, which their duty of zealous representation to these clients\ndemands.  Because they assume with their “well founded belief” that their communications will be intercepted, they\nassert that knowingly engaging in such com munications would breach their duty to keep those com munications\nconfidential.  Therefore, they argue, their professionally imposed ethical obligations make the alleged effects more acute.\nAs a lawyer, I am  certainly mindful of these concerns, but I cannot escape the fact that they are prem ised on the\nplaintiffs’ duties to their clients, and not on a personal ha rm to them selves.  A client, a fter all, can waive such\nconfidentiality, and if a fully informed overseas client who does not fear the NSA chooses to communicate with full\nawareness that the NSA m ight be listening, then th e lawyer would not breach any duty by enga ging in such\ncommunication.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 15\nharm in Laird; the present injury derives solely from the fear of secret government surveillance, not\nfrom some other form of direct governm ent regulation, prescription, or com pulsion.  Id. at 11.\nFinally, the plaintiffs argue that theL aird plaintiffs’ reactions to the surveillance were unreasonable\nbecause there was no illegal conduct alleged in that case.   Laird, however, did not dis cuss the\nreasonableness of its plaintiffs’ response; it held  that the mere subjective chill arising f rom the\ngovernment’s investigative activity — reasona ble or not — is insufficient to establish First\nAmendment standing.   Id. at 15-16;  see also Reagan, 738 F.2d at 1378 (rejecting an identical\nattempt to distinguish Laird).  I find these attempts to distinguish Laird unpersuasive.\nThe plaintiffs have directed us to several other decisions as support for their assertion that\ntheir professional injuries constitute something “more” than subjective chill.  See, e.g., Meese v.\nKeene, 481 U.S. 465 (1987);O  zonoff v. Berzak, 744 F.2d 224 (1st Cir. 1984)P; aton v. LaPrade, 524\nF.2d 862 (3d Cir. 1975).  I reiterate taht the something “more” required by  Laird is not merely more\nsubjective injury, but is the e xercise of governmental power that is regulatory, proscriptive, or\ncompulsory in nature, and that directly regulates, proscribes, or compels the plaintiffs.  And these\nthree cases involve plaintiffs who can show direct injury because the governm ent did directly\nregulate, order, or constrain them.  These cases certainly do not help the present plaintiffs, who are\nnot subject to any direct governm ent regulation, order, or constraint.  Rather, to the extent the\nplaintiffs claim that they are prevented, required,c ompelled, or coerced in their actions, it is due not\nto any direct and immediate order or regulation by the government, but to circumstances stemming\nfrom the plaintiffs’ own subjective apprehension that (1) their communications will be intercepted\nby the NSA and (2) that interception will be detrimental to their overseas contacts.  This is not a\nconcrete, actual, and imminent injury for purposes of establishing standing.  See Laird, 408 U.S. at\n11; Reagan, 738 F.2d at 1378-80.\nIn Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. at 465, the plaintiff, Mr. Keene, a lawyer and a member of the\nstate legislature, wanted to exhibit certain iflms that a federal statute required be labeled as “political\npropaganda.”  Id. at 469-70.  The Court found that the harm to Mr. Keene’s personal, political, and\nprofessional reputation, that woudl result from his exhibiting films labeled “propaganda,” constituted\ninjury in fact.  Id. at 472.  It is evident from even a cursory reading of the case, however, that Mr.\nKeene was subject to a regulatory statute that directly and expressly  ordered the labeling of the\nfilms in the manner that would cause the harm.  Id. at 472-74.  The plaintiffs in the present case are\nnot regulated by the NSA’s operation of the TSP in any way, nor are they directly ordered to do or\nrefrain from doing anything.  Meese offers no support for the plaintiffs’ position.\nIn Ozonoff v. Berzak, 744 F.2d at 224, the plaintiff, Dr. Ozonoff, sought employment with\nthe World Health Organization, and the government ordered him to submit to a loyalty investigation\nas a condition of seeking the job.  Id. at 225.  The First Circuit found that this requirement created\na speech- and association-related qualification for the WHO job, which effectively punished Dr.\nOzonoff for joining certain organizations or expressing certain views.  The court held that this\nrequirement created a concrete injury, satisfying the injury-in-fact element.  Id. at 229.  In contrast,\nthe NSA’s operation of the TSP does not directly  order or require the plaintiffs to do anything;\ninstead, it is the plaintif fs’  subjective apprehension (that the NSA m ight intercept their\ncommunication) that compels, coerces, or motivates the plaintiffs to alter their behavior.  As with\nMeese, Ozonoff offers no support for the plaintiffs’ position under the present circumstances.\nFinally, in Paton v. LaPrade, 524 F.2d at 862, Ms. Paton challenged the governm ent’s\nretention of an FBI file on her alleged involvement with the Socialist Workers Party because the\nexistence of that file “endanger[ed] her future educational and employment opportunities.”  Id. at\n868.  The Third Circuit found a sufficeintly concrete future injury deriving from the existence of that\nfile.  Id.  Ms. Paton was not only subject to government regulation, she knew and could prove that\nthe government had intercepted her specific mail (not just mail of a like kind) and was maintaining\nan FBI file on her particular activities (not just activities  of a like kind).  In stark contrast, the\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 16\nplaintiffs in the present case allege only their suspicion and fear (i.e., their “well founded belief”)\nthat their contacts are likely targets of the TSP  or that their com munications are likely to be\nintercepted.  As documented in the present record, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated and cannot\ndemonstrate that the NSA is monitoring their particular personal activities.\nI find no basis — either factual or legal — upon which to distinguish Laird from the First\nAmendment claim raised by the plaintiffs here, and I conclude that Laird controls this claim.  But\nlet me reemphasize, just to be perfectly clear, that I do not contend that Laird controls this entire\ncase — it does not. L aird controls the First Amendment claim, based on the first type of injury.  The\nplaintiffs’ first alleged injury, arising from a personal subjective chill, is no more concrete, actual,\nor imminent than the injury alleged in  Laird.  The injury in  Laird was insufficient to establish\nstanding for a First Amendment cause of action; the plaintiffs’ first injury is less than or, at best,\nequal to that in Laird; and the plaintiffs’ first injury is likewise insufficient to establish standing.\nThe plaintiffs’ second injury is the unwillingness of their overseas contacts, clients,\nwitnesses, and sources to communicate by telephone or email, due to their fear that the NSA will\nintercept the communications.  The district court, in its standing analysis,r famed the issue this way:\nThe Plaintiffs in this case are not claiming simply that the [NSA]’s surveillance has\n‘chilled’ them from making international calls to sources and clients[2.4]  Rather, they\nclaim that Defendants’ surveillance has chilled their sources, clients, and potential\nwitnesses from communicating with them.   The alleged effect on Plaintiffs is a\nconcrete, actual inability to communicate with witnesses, sources, clients and others\nwithout great expense which has significantly crippled Plaintiffs, at a minimum, in\ntheir ability to report the news and com petently and ef fectively represent their\nclients.\nACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 769 (emphasis added).  Under this view, the plaintiffs claim that\ntheir contacts have been chilled, which prevents them from communicating with these contacts.25\nIn Presbyterian Church v. United States, 870 F.2d 518, 520 (9th Cir1. 989), the Ninth Circuit\nconsidered a claim by plaintiff churches that “INS agents entered the churches wearing ‘body bugs’\nand surreptitiously recorded church services” in violation o fthe First and Fourth Amendments.  The\ndistrict court had dismissed the claims for lack of standing, based on the plaintiffs’ failure to show\ninjury in fact, opining that the protections of the First Amendment extend not to corporations but\nto individuals, because “churches don’t go to heaven.”  Id. at 521.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\nreversed, finding that the plaintiff churches had pled a sufficient injury:\nWhen congregants are chilled from participating in worship activities [and] refuse\nto attend church services because they fear the government is spying on them and\ntaping their every utterance, all as allegedin  the complaint, we think a church suffers\norganizational injury because its ability to carry out its ministries has been impaired.\n24\n In fact, the plaintiffs are claiming that the NSA’s surveillance (coupled with their own ethical obligations)\nhas chilled them from making international calls to sources and clients, as has been discussed throughout this opinion\nthus far.  The district court simply misunderstood the extent of the plaintiffs’ claims.\n25\n In finding an injury on this theory — the unwillingness of the plaintiffs’ overseas contacts to communicate\ndue to their fear that the NSA is eavesdropping — the  district court relied on affidavits submitted by several of the\nindividual plaintiffs.  None of the overseas contacts provided an affidavit or testimony of their alleged fear; the theory\nis based solely on the plaintiffs’ own testimony, which is self-serving and may be inadmissible as hearsay.  Ultimately,\nhowever, the questionable character of this evidence has no bearing on this injury-in-fact analysis, because the outcome\nis the same even if I assume it to be true.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 17\nId. at 522 (emphasis added).  The Ninth Circuit then distinguished Laird:\nAlthough Laird establishes that a litigant’s allegation that it has sufefred a subjective\n‘chill’ does not necessarily confer Article III standing, Laird does not control this\ncase.  The churches in this case are not caliming simply that the INS surveillance has\n‘chilled’ them from holding worship services.  Rather, they claim  that the INS\nsurveillance has chilled individual congregants from attending worship services, and\nthat this effect on the congregants has int urn interfered with the churches’ ability to\ncarry out their ministries.  The alleged effect on the churches is not a mere subjective\nchill on their worship activities; it is a conrcete, demonstrable decrease in attendance\nat those worship activities.  The injury to the churches is ‘distinct and palpable.’\nLaird has no application here.\nId. (citations omitted).\nIn one sense, the Ninth Circui t’s decision could be read as concluding that the churches\nsuffered injury based on the actions of third parties (i.e., individual parishioners) — a reading that\nsupports the plaintiffs’ arguments in favor of standing. 26  In another se nse, however, the Ninth\nCircuit’s decision may be confined to the unique idea of “organizational injury”; a church is, after\nall, an organization comprising a congregation of parishioners, and these congregants are properly\nviewed as intrinsic to the church organization, rather than as separate third parties.  This reading of\nPresbyterian Church would weaken its application to the present contexte bcause the overseas third-\nparty clients, contacts, and sources  in this case are not af filiated with the plaintiffs in the same\nintrinsic manner as are parishioners with a church. 27  None of the plaintiffs  have alleged any\n“organizational injury” in the present context.28\nHaving acknowledged these alternative  i nterpretations of  Presbyterian Church , it is\nunnecessary to resolve that issue definitively on this record.  Injury in fact is but one of the criteria\nnecessary to establish standing, and ultimately, it is not determinative of this case.  Either of the\nother two criteria — causation or redressability — might ultimately defeat the plaintiffs’ claim of\nstanding, even if the plaintiffs’ alleged injury is deemed adequate to state an injury in fact.\nCausation\n“[F]ederal plaintiffs m ust allege som e threatened or actual injury   resulting from the\nputatively illegal action before a federal court may assume jurisdiction.”  Simon, 426 U.S. at 41\n(citations and footnotes omitted; emphasis added).  “In other words, . . . a federal court [may] act\nonly to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and  not\ninjury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.”  Id. at 41-\n42 (emphasis added).  Causation “depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is him self an\nobject of the action . . . at issue.” L  ujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  When\ncausation hinges on independent third parties, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the third\n26\n But see the discussion of the causation elem ent in this First Am endment analysis, infra, regarding the\ndifficulties of obtaining standing based on the conduct of third-party actors.\n27\n The plaintiffs have not claimed membership in any overriding “organization” that would inculde the plaintiffs\nand the overseas contacts.  There has been no suggestiotnh at the plaintiff journalists, academics, or lawyers are members\nof al Qaeda, or that their overseas contacts — presum ably suspected by the NSA of being al Q aeda operatives or\naffiliates — are (or desire to be) members of some organization of American journalists, academics, or lawyers.\n28\n Certain plaintiffs are organizations (American Civil Liberties Union, Council on American Islamic Relations,\nGreenpeace) and it is therefore possible that these plaintiffs, on a different record, might assert organizational injury.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 18\nparties’ choices “have been or will be made in such a manner as to produce causation and permit\nredressability of injury.”  Id. at 562.\nIn the present case, the “putatively illegal action” is the NSA’s interception of  overseas\ncommunications without warrants (specifically FISA warrants), and the “threanteed or actual injury”\nis the added cost of in-person communication with the overseas contacts (or correspondingly, the\ndiminished performance resulting from the inability to communicaet).  Therefore, to show causation,\nthe plaintiffs must show that, but for the lack of warrants (or FISA compliance), they would not\nincur this added cost.  There are two causal pathways based on the two types of alleged injury.  In\nthe first: (1) the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping, (2)c reates in the plaintiffs a “well founded belief”\nthat their overseas telephone and email communications are being intercepted, which (3) requires\nthe plaintiffs to refrain from these communications (i.e., chills communication), and (4) compels the\nplaintiffs to travel overseas to m eet personally with these contacts in order to satisf y their\nprofessional responsibilities, thereby (5) causing the pl aintiffs to incur additional costs.  In the\nsecond:  (1) the NSA’s warr antless wiretapping (2) causes the “well founded belief,” which (3)\ncompels the overseas cont acts to refuse to com municate by telephone or em ail (i.e., chills\ncommunication), thereby (4) requiring in-person communication, with its (5) associated additional\ncosts.  The district court attempted to articulate this relationship:  “All of the Plaintiffs contend that\nthe TSP has caused clients, witnesses and sour ces to discontinue th eir communications with\nplaintiffs out of fear that their communications will be intercepted.”  ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp.\n2d at 767 (footnote omitted).  From this, the district court theorized:  “Plaintiffs would be able to\ncontinue using the telephone and email in the execution of their professional responsibilities if the\nDefendants were not undisputedly and adm ittedly conducting wa rrantless wiretaps of\nconversations.”   Id. at 769.  In considering these causal pathways, I question the second step\n(whether the “well founded belief” is actually founded on the warrantless wiretapping) and refute\nthe third step (whether the unwillingness t o communicate is actually caused by the warrantless\ncharacter of the wiretaps).\nThe underpinning of the second step is questionable.  The plaintiffs allege that they have a\n“well founded belief” that their overseas contacts are likely tar gets of the NSA and that their\nconversations are being intercepted.  The plaintiffs have no evidence, however, that the NSA has\nactually intercepted (or will actually intercept) a ny of their conversations.  No ma tter what the\nplaintiffs and others might find “reasonable,” the evidence establishes only a possibility — not a\nprobability or certainty — that these calls m ight be intercepted, that the inf ormation might be\ndisclosed or disseminated, or that this might lead to some harm to the overseas contacts.  While this\nlack of evidence is not, by itself, enough tod isprove causation, the absence of this evidence makes\nthe plaintiffs’ showing of causation less certain and the likelihood of causation more speculative.\nThe third step is unsupportable.  In this step, eth plaintiffs allege, andt he district court found,\nthat it is the absence of a warrant (and all that goes with i2t9) that has chilled the plaintiffs and their\noverseas contacts from communicating by telephone or email.  See ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d\nat 769 (“Plaintiffs would be able to continue using the telephone and email in the execution of their\nprofessional responsibilities if the Defendants were not  undisputedly and admittedly conducting\n29\n The well-known Fourth Amendment warrant requirement involves interjection of a neutral and detached\nmagistrate, demonstration of probable cause, and description of the things to be seized or the place to be searched.  See\nDalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238, 255 (1979);U  nited States v. U.S. Dist. Ct. (Keith), 407 U.S. 297, 316 (1972).  The\nmore obscure FISA warrant requirement involves a petition by a federal official, with the approval of the Attorney\nGeneral, 50 U.S.C. § 1804(a), to a specialF ISA Court, § 1803(a), for an order approving the electronic surveillance for\nforeign intelligence purposes, § 1805, basedu pon “probable cause to believe that the target of thee lectronic surveillance\nis a foreign power or the agent of a foreignp ower,” § 1805(a)(3)(A).  The FISA petition and order must include, among\nother things, provisions to limit the duration, §§ 1805(a)(10), -(c)(1)(E), -(e), and content, §§ 1804(a)(6), 1805(c)(1)(C),\n1806(i), of the surveillance, and provisions to ensure the minimization of the acquisition, retention, and dissemination\nof the information, §§ 1804(a)(5), 1805(a)(4), -(c)(2(A), 1806, 1801(h).\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 19\nwarrantless wiretaps of conversations.”).  Thi sallegation does not stand up under scrutiny, however,\nand it is not clear whether the chill can fairly be traced to the absence of a warrant, or if the chill\nwould still exist without regard to the presence or absence of a warrant.  The insufficiency of this\nstep leads to a breakdown in the causal pathway. S ee Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43; Laird, 408 U.S. at\n14 n.7 (“Not only have respondents left somewhat unclear the precise connection between the mere\nexistence of the challenged system and their own alleged chill, but they have also cast considerable\ndoubt on whether they themselves are in fact suffering from any such chill.”).\nA wiretap is always “secret” — that is its very purpose — and because of this secrecy,\nneither the plaintiffs nor their overseas contacts would know, with or without a warrant, whether\ntheir communications were being tapped.  Therefore, the NSA’s secret possession of a warrant\nwould have no more effect on the subjective willingness or unwillingness of these parties to “freely\nengage in conversations and correspond via email,” see ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 770, than\nwould the secret absence of that warrant.  The planitiffs have neither asserted nor proven any basis\nupon which to justifiably conclude that the mere absence of a warrant — rather than some other\nreason, such as the prosecution of the W ar on Te rror, in general, or the NSA’s targeting of\ncommunications involving suspected al Qaeda terrorists, affiliates, and supporters, in particular —\nis the cause of the plaintiffs’ (and their overesas contacts’) reluctance to communicate by telephone\nor email.\nThe plaintiffs have argued that if the NSA were to conduct its surveillance in compl iance\nwith FISA, they would no longer feel compelled to cease their international telephone and email\ncommunications.30  But again, even if the NSA had (secretly) obtained FISA warrants for each of\nthe overseas contacts, who the plaintiffs themselves assert are likely to be monitored, the plaintiffs\nwould still not have known their communications were being intercepted, still faced the same fear\nof harm to their contacts, still incurred the sa me self-imposed (or contact-imposed) burden on\ncommunications and, therefore, still suffered the same alleged injury.  The plaintiffs’ theory relies\non their contention that their ethica l obligations require them  to cease telephone or em ail\ncommunications any tim e they believe the private or privileged inform ation in those\ncommunications might be discovered or disclosed to the detrim ent of their clients, sources, or\ncontacts.  Assuming that this contention is true, it must also be true that this ethical obligation would\narise whenever, and continue so long as, the plainftfis believe their contacts to be the types of people\nlikely to be monitored by the NSA.\nThe imposition of FISA requirements into this scenario would not change the likelihood that\nthese overseas contacts are the types of people whot he plaintiffs believe would be monitored.  Nor\nwould it change the plaintiffs’ “well founded belief” that the NSA is intercepting their\ncommunications with these individuals, the plaintiffs’ ethical obligations, or the overseas contacts’\nsubjective fears.  Even under the plaintiffs’ depictoin, it would merely assure the plaintiffs and their\ncontacts that — while their international tele phone and e mail communications with al Qaeda\naffiliates are still just as likely to be intercepted — the NSA will obtain FISA Court orders, which\nwill presumably limit the duration and content of the acquisition and the use and dissemination of\nthe acquired information.  The plaintiffs, however, have not asserted, explained, or proven how a\nchange in the duration or content of the NSA’isn terceptions — purely hypothetical changes that are\nunknown and unknowable based on the established record and the State Secrets Doctrine — would\nalleviate their  fear s.  Specifically, the plainti ffs have not proffered any types or topics of\ncommunication, from which they are currently refraining, but about which — upon the imposition\n30\n FISA’s applicability (i.e., the plaintiffs’ standing to bring a cause of action under FISA) is addressed\nseparately in Section IV.B.3, infra.  The present discussion, which concerns only the plaintiffs’ assertion that their First\nAmendment injuries are caused by the NSA’s failure to comply with FISA (or would be redressed by imposing FISA’s\nrequirements), assumes FISA’s applicability and does not address standing vis a vis a FISA cause of action.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 20\nof FISA’s limitations and protections — they would thereafter “freely engage in conversations and\ncorrespond[ence] via email.”  See ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 770.\nSome plaintiffs (especi ally those who are  lawyers) assert that the im position of FISA\nminimization — to limit the use and dissemination of the information acquired — would relieve\ntheir fears sufficiently to satisfy their  ethical obligations because it would ensure that those\ncommunications would remain confidential and privileged in the event of a subsequent c riminal\nprosecution, removal proceeding, military tribunal, etc.  Therefore, they argue, imposition of FISA\nrequirements would alter the type and content of their communications.  This theory, however, is\npredicated on the assumption that their current fears and apprehensions are justified — and there is\nno support for this assum ption.  First, there is no evidence in the cur rent record from which to\npresume that the information collected by the NSA via warrantless wiretapping will be used or\ndisclosed for any purpose other than national securiyt.  Next, there is no evidence in the record from\nwhich to presume that the NSA is not complying with, or even exceeding, FISA’s restrictions on the\nacquisition, retention, use, or disclosure of thisi nformation (i.e., FISA’s minimization techniques).\nFinally, there is no basis to presume that traditional post-hoc remedies, such as the Exclusionary\nRule or FISA’s civil suit provision, 50 U.S.C.  § 1810, would not adequately deter the us e or\ndissemination of this inf ormation.  Consequentl y, this disconnect in th e plaintiffs’ theory is\nunavoidable, and the plaintiffs’ injury is not fairly traceable to the m ere absence of FISA\ncompliance.\nUnder the plaintiffs’ second form of injury (i.e., the ref usal by the overseas contacts to\ncommunicate by telephone or email), this third step in the causal pathway is further disrupted by the\nindependent decisions of the third-party overseas contacts.  In Simon, the Supreme Court held that,\ndue to the independence of third-party actors, its plai ntiffs could not prove a causal connection\nbetween the defendant’s misconduct and the alleged injury:\nThe complaint here alleged only that [the government], by the adoption of Revenue\nRuling 69-545, had ‘encouraged’ [the third-party] hospitals to deny services to [the\nindigent plaintiffs]. . . . [But, it] is purely speculative whether the denials of service\n[i.e., the alleged harm ] specified in the com plaint fairly can be traced to [ the\ngovernment’s] ‘encouragement’ or instead result from decisions made by the [third-\nparty] hospitals without regard to the tax implications [i.e., government conduct].\nSimon, 462 U.S. at 42-43.  In the present case, as inS imon, it is possible that the overseas contacts’\nrefusal to communicate with the plaintiffs has nor elation to the putatively illegal government action\nof wiretapping without FISA com pliance.  The m ere fact that the United States governm ent is\naggressively prosecuting a worldwide W ar on Terror — in which, by t he plaintiffs’ own “well\nfounded belief,” these contacts are likely suspects —w ould appear sufficient to chill these overseas\ncontacts regardless of the absence of FISA protections.  Notably, the record contains no testimony,\nby affidavit or otherwise, from  any of the overseas contacts them selves as to the cause of their\nrefusal to communicate; it contains only the plaintiffs’ self-serving assertions and affidavits.\nThe plaintiffs have not shown a sufficient causal connection between the com plained-of\nconduct (i.e., the absence of a warrant or FISA protection) and the alleged harm (i.e., the inability\nto communicate).  This inadequacy is further exemplified in the analysis of redressability.\nRedressability\n“Relief that does not rem edy the injury suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal\ncourt; that is the very essence of  the redressability requirem ent.”  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 107.\nRedressability thus requires “that prospective relief will remove the harm,” Warth, 422 U.S. at 505,\nand the plaintiff must show “that he personally would benefit in a tangible way from the court’s\nintervention,” id. at 508 (footnote omitted).  In the prototypical redressability case, Linda R.S. v.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 21\nRichard D., 410 U.S. 614, 615 (1973) , a single mother sought to compel the State to enforce a\ncriminal statute against the father of her illegitimate child and imprison him for his failure to pay\nchild support.  The Supreme Court acknowledged that the mother had “no doubt suffered an injury\nstemming from the failure of her child’s father to contribute support payments.”  Id. at 618.  The\nCourt reasoned, however, that even if she “were granted the requested relief, it would result only\nin the jailing of t he child’s father,” and not rem edy the harm caused by his failure to pay child\nsupport.  Id.  The Court thus held that “the ‘direct’ relationship between the alleged injury and the\nclaim sought to be adjudicated, which . . . is a preerquisite of standing,” was absent in that case. I d.\nIn the present case, the plaintiffs requesteda  declaratory judgment and an injunction.  They\ntheorize that their injury (i.e., deficient professional performance or the additional cost of in-person\ncommunication) will be redressed by a declaration that the NSA’s practice of  warrantless\nwiretapping is unlawful, because it naturally follows that the unlawful conduct will be prohibited.\nThe declaratory judgm ent thus f orms the basi s for an injunction prohibiting interception of\ncommunications without FISA compliance.  The district court agreed, declaring the NSA’s conduct\nillegal and imposing an injunction, on the belief that  its injunction would redress the plaintiffs’\ninjury by assuring them “that they could freely engage in conversations and correspond via email\nwithout concern, at least without notice, thats uch communications were being monitored.”  ACLU\nv. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 770-71.  This theory of redressability rests on the preimse that the NSA’s\ncompliance with FISA’s warrant requirements will entice the plaintiffs and their contacts to “freely\nengage in conversations and corerspond via email without concern.”  The likelihood of this outcoem,\nhowever, “can, at best, be termed only speculative,” see Linda R.S., 410 U.S. at 618; it is just as\nlikely (if not more likely) that, even with the imposition of a warrant requirement, the plaintiffs’\ncurrent situation will not change — their fears will not be abated.\nThe TSP is designed and operated for the prevention of terrorism, and the NSA is interested\nonly in telephone and email communications in which one party to the communication is located\noutside the United States and the NSA has a “reas onable basis to conclude that one party to the\ncommunication is a member of al Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or a member of an organization\naffiliated with al Qaeda, or working in support of  al Qaeda.”  It is reasonable to a ssume that the\nFISA Court would authorize the interception of this type of communication, see 50 U.S.C. § 1805,\nand keeping this likelihood in mind, the issuance of FISA warrants would not relieve any of the\nplaintiffs’ fears of being overheard ;it would relieve them only of the fear that the information might\nbe disseminated or used against them.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(5); 1801(b)(1)-(4); 1806(a) & (h)\n(minimization requirements).31  Recall, however, that the NSA has not disclosed or disseminated\nany of the information obtained via this warrantless wiretapping.  This “remedy” would therefore\nnot alter the plaintiffs’ current situation and, accordingly, would not redress the injuries alleged.\n31\n FISA does not necessarilyp rohibit even the interception of attorney-client communications.  Because FISA\nstates that “[n]o otherwise privileged com munication obtained in accordance with [ FISA] shall lose its privileged\ncharacter,” 50 U.S.C. § 1806(a), it therefore follows that FISA, at least in some instances, authorizes the interception\nof privileged communications, which presumably includes communications between attorney and client.  For example,\nFISA might not prohibit the interception of attorney-clien ctommunications under circumstances where the NSA adheres\nto a policy of complete non-disclosure.  Due to the St ate Secrets Doctrine, the plaintiffs do not (and cannot) know\nwhether the NSA actually adheres to a policy of complete non-disclosure, but based on the record evidence, it certainly\nremains possible.  The plaintiffs have never alleged, nor is  there evidence in the presen t record to suggest, that the\ninformation collected by the NSA under the TSP has been disclosed to anyone for any purpose. S ee ACLU v. NSA, 438\nF. Supp. 2d at 771 (“the perceived need for secrecy has apparetlny required that no person be notifiedth at he is aggrieved\nby the activity, and there have been no prosecutions, no requests for extensions or retroactive approvals of warrants”).\nIn any event, FISA’s general requirement that electronic surveillance may proceed only upon issuance of a FISA Court\nwarrant is not absolute, as FISA provides for instances in which a prior warrant may be unnecessary, at least for a short\nperiod of time.  See, e.g., 50 U.S.C. § 1805(f) (emergency situations).\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 22\nNeither will the requested injunctive relief increaes the likelihood that the plaintiffs and their\noverseas contacts will resum e telephone or em ail communications.  As discussed previously,\n“warrantless” and “secret” are unrelated things.  All wiretaps are secret, and the plaintiffs are not\nchallenging the secret nature, but only thew  arrantless nature, of the TSP.  Because all wiretaps are\nsecret, neither the plaintiffs nor their overseasc ontacts would know — with or without warrants —\nwhether their communications were being tapped, and the secret possession of a warrant would have\nno more effect on the subjective willingness or unwillingness of these parties to “freely engage in\nconversations and correspond via email” than would the secret absence of that warrant.  Thus, as a\npractical matter, the mere issuance of a warrant w ould not alleviate either the pl aintiffs’ or the\ncontacts’ fears of interception, and consequently, would not redress the alleged injury.  Even if the\nwiretaps were not secret — that is, if the overseas contacts and the plaintiffs were actually notified\nbeforehand that the NSA was tapping their communication — this knowledge would not redress the\nalleged injury.  It is patently unreasonable to think that those who are reluctant to speak when they\nsuspect the NSA of listening would be willing to speak once they know the NSA is listening.\nThe district court’s injunction is also insufficient to relieve the plaintiffs’ fear of reprisal\nagainst their contacts.  A warrant requireme nt will not protect the overseas contacts f rom\nprosecution in all circumstances, see In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d. 717, 731 (F.I.S.C.R. 2002), which\nleaves some doubt whether this will allay their fears enough to entice them to resume unreserved\ncommunications with the plaintiffs.  Ironically, the absence of a warrant would be more likely to\nprohibit the government from using the intercepted information in a subsequent prosecution, due to\nthe probability that the Exclusionary Rule woudl bar the admission of information obtained without\na warrant.  See Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961).  The  warrant requirement does many\nthings; it does not, however, remedy the injuries alleged by the plaintiffs in this case.\nSimilarly, to the extent the plaintiffs or their contacts fear some misconduct by the NSA (in\nthe discovery, disclosure, or dissemination of the information), the mere requirement of a warrant,\nFISA or otherwise, will not guarantee the preventioonf  that misconduct, and therefore fails to satisfy\nthe redressability element.  In  Leeke v. Timmerman, 454 U.S. 83, 84-85 (1981), f ederal prison\ninmates, who had filed criminal charges against prison guards for a beating that occurred during a\nprison uprising, filed suit in federal court to facilitate the issuance of arrest warrants for the guards.\nOn review, the Supreme Court found that the issuance of an arrest warrant “is simply a prelude to\nactual prosecution,” because “the decision to pros ecute is solely within the discretion of the\nprosecutor [and] issuance of t he arrest warrant  in this case would not necessarily lead to a\nsubsequent prosecution.”  Id. at 86-87.  The Court held that the inm ates lacked standing because\nthere was “no guarantee that issuance of the arre st wa rrant[s] would rem edy claimed past\nmisconduct of guards or prevent future misconduct.”  Id. at 86.  Any such guarantee (i.e, that the\nissuance of a FISA warrant will prevent future FISA misconduct) is similarly lacking in the present\ncase.\nConsequently, the district court’s declaration againstw  arrantless wiretaps is insufficient to\nredress the plaintiffs’ alleged injury because teh plaintiffs’ self-imposed burden on communications\nwould survive the issuance of FISA warrants.  Theo nly way to redress the injury would be to enjoin\nall wiretaps, even those for which warrants are issued and for which full prior notice is given to the\nparties being tapped.  Only then would the plaintiffs be relieved of their fear that their contacts are\nlikely under surveillance, the contacts be relieved of tehir fear of surveillance, and the parties be able\nto “freely engage in conversations and correspond via em ail without concern.”  Because such a\nbroad remedy is unavailable, the plaintiffs’ requested relief, which is much narrower, would not\nredress their alleged injury.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs in the present action have no standing to pursue their\nFirst Amendment claim.  Even if they could demonstrate injury, they cannot establish causation, and\ntheir alleged injury is not redressable by the remedy they seek.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 23\n2.  Fourth Amendment\nThe plaintiffs allege that the NSA has, byc onducting the warrantless wiretaps, violated the\n“plaintiffs’ privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.”  The district court — asserting\na heretofore unprecedented, absolute rule that the Fourth Amendment “requires prior warrants for\nany reasonable search,” ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 775 — agreeda nd granted the plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on this theory, id. at 782.\nHowever, the Supreme Court has made clear that Fourth Amendment rights are “personal\nrights” which, unlike First Amendment rights, may not be asserted vicariously.S  ee Rakas v. Illinois,\n439 U.S. 128, 133-34 (1978).  The Court explained in Rakas:\nUnder petitioners’ target theory, a court  could determine that a def endant had\nstanding [] without having to inquire into the substantive questi on of whether the\nchallenged search or seizure violated theF ourth Amendment rights of that particular\ndefendant.  However, having rejected petitioners’ target theory and reaffirmed the\nprinciple that the rights assured by the Fourth Amendment are personal rights, which\nmay be enforced [] only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed\nby the search and seizure, the question necessarily arises whether it serves any useful\nanalytical purpose to consider this principle a matter of standing, distinct from the\nmerits of a defendant’s Fourth Amendment claim. . . .  Rigorous application of the\nprinciple that the rights secured by this Amendment are personal, in place of a notion\nof ‘standing,’ will produce no additiona l situations in which evidence m ust be\nexcluded.  The inquiry under either approach is the same.  But we think the better\nanalysis forth-rightly focuses on the extent of a particular defendant’s rights under\nthe Fourth Amendment, rather than on any theoretically separate, but invariably\nintertwined concept of standing.\nId. at 138-39 (quotation marks, citations, footnotes, and edits omitted; emphasis added); see also\nEllsberg v. Mitchell, 709 F.2d 51, 65 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“An essential eleemnt of each plaintiff’s case\nis proof that he himself has been injured.  Membership in a group of people, ‘one or more’ members\nof which were exposed to surveillance, is insufficient to satisfy that requirement.”).\nThe plaintiffs do not, and cannot,32 assert that any of their own communications have ever\nbeen intercepted.  Instead, they allege only a belife that their communications are being intercepted,\nbased on their own assessment of their overseas contacts as people who are likely to fall within the\nNSA’s broad, public description of its targets.   As acknowledged by plaintiffs’ counsel at oral\nargument, it would be unprecedented for this court to find standing for plaintiffs to litigate a Fourth\nAmendment cause of action without any evidence that the plaintiffs thesmelves have been subjected\nto an illegal search or seizure.  See Rakas, 439 U.S. at 133-34.\n3.  Separation of Powers\nThe plaintiffs allege that the NSA has, by conducting the warrantless wiretaps, “violat[ed]\nthe principle of the separation of powers because[ the NSA’s conduct] was authorized by President\nBush in excess of his Executive authority under Article II of the United States Constitution and is\ncontrary to limits imposed by Congress.”  Th is two-part accusation — that President Bush\n(1) exceeded his presidential authority under the  Constitution, and (2) violated a statutory lim it\nimposed upon that authority by Congress — presupposes that the Constitution gives Congress the\nauthority to impose limits on the President’s powers under the present circumstances.  The district\n32\n The plaintiffs’ prospective inability to assert that anoyf  their personal communications have been intercepted\nis due to the State Secrets Doctrine.  See Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 10.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 24\ncourt agreed with the plaintiffs’ allegation in toto, and declared the NSA’s conduct a violation of\nthe Separation of Powers Doctrine.  See ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 779-79.\nA plaintiff asserting a claim under the Separation of Powers Doctrine must, like all other\nplaintiffs seeking to bring a claim  in federal court, dem onstrate injury in fact, causation, and\nredressability.   INS v. Chadha , 462 U.S. 919, 936 (1983) (requiring an “injury in fact and a\nsubstantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prevent or redress the claimed injury”);\nsee also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 117 (1976) (stating that “litigants with sufficient concrete\ninterests at stake may have standing to raise  constitutional questions of separation of powers”).\nHere, the plaintiffs contend that the executive branc h(i.e., the NSA at the direction of the President)\nhas, by instituting the TSP’s practice of warrantlses wiretapping, acted in excess of its constitutional\nor statutory limitations, thereby encroaching upon the powers expressly reserved to another branch\n(i.e., Congress).  The NSA’s violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine, the plaintiffs say, has\ncaused them to fear that the NSA might intercept their communications with their overseas contacts,\npreventing them from performing their jobs or pursuing other lawful objectives without incurring\nadditional burden and expense.\nTo prove causation, the plaintiffs must connect the alleged separation-of-powers violation\n(“the putatively illegal action”) to the burden on the performance of their professional obligations\n(the alleged injury).  See Simon, 426 U.S. at 41.  Six steps separate the putatively illegal conduct\nfrom the alleged injury:  (1) the President allegedly exceeded his allotted authority by authorizing\nthe NSA to conduct warrantless wiretapping as part of its enhanced national security (i.e., counter-\nterrorism) operations and the worldwide War on Terror, causing (2) the NSA to institute its practice\nof warrantless wiretapping under the TSP, causing (3)t he plaintiffs’ “well founded belief” that the\nNSA is intercepting their telephone and email communications, causing (4) either the plaintiffs\nthemselves or the overseas contacts to refrain form these communications, causing (5) the plaintiffs\neither to underperform in their professional capacities or to travel to m eet personally with these\ncontacts, causing (6) the additional burden on performance of the plaintiffs’ professional duties.\nThis record simply does not permit the kind of particularized analysis that is required to\ndetermine causation.  Ignoring for a moment the first two steps in the analysis, it is clear that the\nthird and fourth are problematic.  The plaintiffs have presented no evidence to support their alleged\n“well founded belief” that their conversations areb eing intercepted.  The evidence establishes only\na possibility — not a probability or certainty — that these communications might be intercepted,\ndisclosed, or disseminated.  Furthermore, the reasonableness of this possibility is indeterminable,\ndue to the limited record before us and the State Secrets Doctrine.  Unlike each of the cases in which\nthe Supreme Court has found standing for a Separation of Powers claim, the plaintiffs in this case\ndo not, and cannot,33 assert that they themselves have actually been subjected to the conduct alleged\nto violate the Separation of Powers.  See, e.g., Chadha, 462 U.S. at 923, 930, 935-36 (reviewing\nwhether one “House of Congress” could order the plaintiff deported);  Buckley, 424 U.S. at 117\n(reviewing whether the Federal Election Commission could make rulings regarding the plaintiff);\nPalmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389, 390 (1973) (reviewing whether the plaintiff could be tried\nbefore non-Article III courts); Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 532-33 (1962) (reviewing\nwhether the plaintiffs’ cases could be adjudicaetd by judges designated from non-Article III courts).\nThe Supreme Court has been clear that the injury must be “distinct and palpable, and not abstract\nor conjectural,” so as to avoid “generalized grievances m ore appropriately addressed in the\nrepresentative branches” and the electoral process.  Allen, 468 U.S. at 751 (citations omitted).\n33\n The plaintiffs’ prospective inability to assert that anoyf  their personal communications have been intercepted\nis due to the State Secrets Doctrine.  See Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 10.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 25\nIt is also unclear from  the record whether the plaintiffs’ or their contacts’ refusal to\ncommunicate can fairly be traced to the Presid ent’s authorization of an am biguous warrantless\nwiretapping program, or if that same refusal would exist regardless of the authorization of the TSP.\nAnd any wiretap would be m erely one com ponent of counter- terrorist or m ilitary intelligence\nsurveillance.  Those such as the present plaintiffs, who choose to com municate with individuals\nlocated overseas who are by the plaintiffs’ own reckoning individuals reasonably suspected to be\nal Qaeda terrorists, affiliates, or supporters, shoudl expect that those communications will be subject\nto heightened monitoring and surveillance for national security or military purposes.  Therefore, the\nplaintiffs have no evidence to support a conclusion that the President’s authorization of the TSP\nwould have any m ore effect on t he parties’ re spective apprehensions than would the broader\ncircumstances of the War on Terror and heightened national security.\nBecause the plaintiffs cannot dem onstrate that the alleged violation of the Separation of\nPowers has caused their injury, they lack standing to litigate their separation-of-powers claim.  It\nis therefore not necessary to address redressability, the third element of standing.\nFinally, I note that the district court statedt hat, unless it found standing for these plaintiffs,\nthe President’s action would be insulated from judicial review.  This idea, however, is neither novel\nnor persuasive.  “The assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have\nstanding, is not a reason to find standing.”  Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418\nU.S. 208, 227 (1974).  Nevertheless, the district coutr editorialized that, if it “were to deny standing\nbased on the unsubstantiated minor distinctions drawn by Defendants, the President’s actions in\nwarrantless wiretapping, in contravention of FISA,T  itle III, and the First and Fourth Amendments,\nwould be immunized from judicial scrutiny.  It wa s never the intent of the Fram ers to give the\nPresident such unfettered control . . . .”  ACLU v. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 771.\nThe Supreme Court has confronted this suggestion and expressly rejected it, explaining its\nreasoning at some length:\nIt can be argued that if respondent is not permitted to litigate this issue, no one can\ndo so.  In a very real sense, the absence of any pa rticular individual or class to\nlitigate these claims gives support to the argum ent that the subject m atter is\ncommitted to the surveillance of Congress, and ultimately to the political process.\nAny other conclusion would m ean that the Founding Fa thers intended to set up\nsomething in the nature of an Atheniand emocracy or a New England town meeting\nto oversee the conduct of the National Government by means of lawsuits in federal\ncourts.  The Constitution created a  representative Governm ent with the\nrepresentatives directly responsible to their constituents at stated periods of two,\nfour, and six years; that the Constitution does not afford a judicial remedy does not,\nof course, completely disable the citizen who is not satisfied with the ‘ground rules’\nestablished by the Congress for reporting  expenditures of the Executive Branch.\nLack of standing within the narrow confines of Art. III jurisdiction does not impair\nthe right to assert his views in the politica florum or at the polls.  Slow, cumbersome,\nand unresponsive though the traditional electoral process may be thought at times,\nour system  provides for changing m embers of the poli tical branches when\ndissatisfied citizens convince a sufficient number of their fellow electors that elected\nrepresentatives are delinquent in performing duties committed to them.\nUnited States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 179 (1974).  The Court noted inL aird:  “there is nothing\nin our Nation’s history or in this Court’s d ecided cases, including our holding today, that can\nproperly be seen as giving any indication that act ual or threatened injury by reason of unlawful\nactivities of the [executive branch] would go unnoticed or unremedied.”  Laird, 408 U.S. at 16.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 26\nThe plaintiffs allege that the President, as an actor in our tripartite system of government,\nexceeds his constitutional authority by authorizing the NSA to engage in warrantless wiretaps of\noverseas communications under the TSP.  But this ocurt, not unlike the President, has constitutional\nlimits of its own and, despite the im portant national interests at stake, cannot exceed its allot ted\nauthority.  See Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 125 n.20 (“[O]ur standing doctrine is rooted in separation-of-\npowers concerns.”); Flast, 392 U.S. at 97 (stating that Article III standing lim itations “confine\nfederal courts to a role consistent with a system of separated powers”).  It would ill behoove us to\nexceed our authority in order to condemn the President or Congress for exceeding theirs.\nB.  Statutory Claims\nIn addition to their three constitutional claims, the plaintiffs present statutory claims under\nthe APA, Title III, and FISA (or a combination thereof).  The first step is to consider whether any\nof these statutes “authorize[] review at the behest of the plaintiff[s]” — i.e., whether these statutes\n(1) govern the NSA’s challenged conduct and (2) provide the plaintiffs a means of judicial review.\nSee Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at 732.  The availability of a statutory claim, however, does not relieve\nthe plaintiffs of the need to establish constitutional standing to litigate that claim.  See Raines, 521\nU.S. at 820 n.3 (“It is  settled that Congress cannot erase Article III’s standing requirements by\nstatutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.”).34\nThis standing analysis includes consideration o fboth constitutional and prudential principles.\nElk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 11-12 (2004).  The irreducible constitutional\nminimum of standing contains  three requirements: (1) injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3)\nredressability.  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 102-03.  The prudentiaslt anding doctrine embodies “judicially\nself-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 161\n(1997).  Because these prudential principles are“ limits” on standing, they do not themselves create\njurisdiction; they exist only to remove jurisdiction where the Article III standing requirements are\notherwise satisfied.  A prudential standing principle of particular relevance to statutory causes of\naction is the “zone-of-interest” test, which “limits . . . the exercise of federal jurisdiction” where a\nplaintiff’s claim falls outside “the zone of interest protected by the law invoked.”  Allen, 468 U.S.\nat 751.35  The APA, Title III, and FISA are each addressed separately, followed by consideration\nof a cause of action which, the plaintiffs theorize, arises from the interaction of Title III and FISA.\n34\n Raines stands for the proposition that Congress cannot enact  a statute that directly grants standing to a\nplaintiff who otherwise does not satisfy the Article III requirements.  But Raines does not indicate that Congressc annot\nprovide standing indirectly by enacting a statute that creates a new legal interest, “the invasion of which will confer\nstanding.”  See Simon, 426 U.S. at 41 n.22.  Analysis of the plaintiffs’ statutory claims thus requires a detailed\nconsideration of the statute at issue, to discern whether Congress “create[d] a statutory right or entitlement the alleged\ndeprivation of which can confer standing to sue.”  See Warth, 422 U.S. at 514.  Thus, in my opinion, the mere fact that\nthese plaintiffs cannot show they were subject to surveillance under the TSP — while sufficient to demonstrate lack of\nstanding for their constitutional claims — does not foreclose them from bringing their statutory claims.  Assessment of\nwhether the plaintiffs have standing to litigate their statut ory claims requires more — an analysis of t he rights and\ninterests protected therein.\n35\n The Supreme Court first announced the zone-of-interestt est in a case involving theA  PA, stating that “[t]he\nquestion of standing . . . concerns . . . whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within\nthe zone of interest to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.”  Ass’n of Data\nProcessing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970).  Although this original formulation implied that the\nzone-of-interest test may be a means of establishing standing ,the Supreme Court has since made it clear that the zone-of-\ninterest test is a prudential limitation, not an affirmative means of establishing standing.  See Allen, 468 U.S. at 751;\nValley Forge, 454 U.S. at 474-75.  The Court also has distinguished various instances in which thez one-of-interest test\napplies.  Suits brought under the APA are them  ost prevalent cases employing that test, see Camp, 397 U.S. at 153, and\nin those cases the zone of interest is broader because  of the “generous review provisions” enumerated in the APA,\nBennett, 520 U.S. at 163. T he test also has been listed among the generally applicable prudential limitations of standing,\nsee Allen, 468 U.S. at 751, where the zone of interest, depending upon the statute at issue, is often narrower than under\nthe APA, see Bennett, 520 U.S. at 163.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 27\n1.  Administrative Procedures Act\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 101-913, governs the conduct of\nfederal administrative agencies, which presumably includes the NSA,s ee 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1).  The\nAPA provides that “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of any  agency action, or adversely\naffected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to\njudicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702 (emphasis added).  The APA authorizes judicial review for\n“[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other\nadequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704 (emphasis added).36  Thus, to bring a cause of action\nunder the APA, the plaintiffs, first and foremost, must complain of “agency action.”\n“Agency action” is defined in the APA as “the  whole or part of an agency rule, order,\nlicense, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13).\nThis definition is divided into three parts “begin[ning] with a list of five categories of decisions\nmade or outcomes implemented by an agency — agency rule, order, license, sanction[, or] relief.”\nNorton v. S. Utah Wilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004) (quotation marks omitted).\nAll of t hose categories involve  circumscribed, discrete agency actions , as their\ndefinitions make clear:  [1] ‘an agency st atement of . . . future  effect designed to\nimplement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy’ (rule); [2] ‘a final disposition . . . in\na matter other than rule m aking’ (order); [3] a ‘perm it . . . or other form  of\npermission’ (license); [4] a ‘prohibition  . . . or taking [of] other com pulsory or\nrestrictive action’ (sanction); or [5] a ‘grnat of money, assistance, license, authority,’\netc., or ‘recognition of a claim, right, immunity,’ etc., or ‘taking of other action on\nthe application or petition of, and beneficial to, a person’ (relief).\nId. (quoting 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(4), (6), (8), (10), (11))  (emphasis added).  The second part of the\n“agency action” definition — “the equivalent or denial thereof” — must be a discrete action or the\ndenial of a discrete action, otherwise it would not beeq uivalent to the five listed categories. I d.  And\nthe final part of the definition —a  “failure to act” — is “properly understood as a failure to take an\nagency action.”  Id.  Under Supreme Court precedent, classic examples of “agency action” include\nthe issuance of an agency opinion, see Bennett, 520 U.S. at 157, or a declaratory ruling, see Nat’l\nCable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 977-78 (2005).\nHere, however, the plaintiffs are not complaining of “agency action” as defined in the APA,\nand the record contains no evidence that would uspport such a finding.  The plaintiffs challenge the\nNSA’s warrantless interception of overseas com munications, the NSA’s failure to comply with\nFISA’s warrant requirements, and the NSA’s presumed failure to comply with FISA’s minimization\nprocedures.  This is conduct, not “agency action.”  Furthermore, there is no authority to support the\ninvocation of the APA to challenge generalized conduct.\nLooking at the “five categories” of enum erated “agency action,” the NSA’s surveillance\nactivities, as described by the three facts of record, do not constitute, nor are they conducted\npursuant to, any agency rule, order, license, sanction, or relief.  Although the plaintiffs labeled the\nNSA’s surveillance activities as “the Program ,” and the district court la beled it the “TSP,” the\nNSA’s wiretapping is ac tually just general conduct given a label for purposes of abbreviated\nreference.  The plaintiffs do not  complain of any NSA rule or order, but m erely the generalized\npractice, which — so far as has been admitted or disclosed — was not formally enacted pursuant\n36\n Admittedly, this provision is seldom considered from the present viewpoint, and is generally considered as\nmerely the means by which Congress waived sovereign immunity in actions seeking relief other than money damages.\nSee Presbyterian Church, 870 F.2d at 524.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 28\nto the strictures of the APA, but merely authorized by the President (albeit repeatedly, and possibly\ninformally).  Nor do the plaintiffs challenge any license, sanction, or relief issued by the NSA.\nThe plaintiffs do not complain of anything equivalent to agency action, which also requires\nsome discrete action by the NSA.S  ee Norton, 542 U.S. at 62.  The plaitniffs are not challenging any\nsort of “circumscribed, discrete” action on the part o fthe NSA, but are seeking to invalidate or alter\nthe NSA’s generalized practice of wiretapping certain overseas communications without warrants.\nSee id. at 64 (“[t]he limitation to discrete agency action precludes [a] broad programmatic attack”).\nSimilarly, the plaintiffs have not alleged that the NSA failed to perform a discrete agency action.\nWhen challenging an agency’s failure to perform, the APA “empowers a court only to compel an\nagency to perform a ministerial or non-discretionary act.”   Id.  The plaintiffs contest the NSA’s\nfailure to adhere to FISA’s warrant requirement and minimization procedures.  Even assum ing,\narguendo, that the warrant requirement and minimization procedures are discrete agency actions,\nthose procedures are replete with discretionary considerations,  see 50 U.S.C. § 1801(h), thus\ndisqualifying them from this definition of agency action under the APA.\nNo matter how the plaintiffs’ claims are characterized, they do not challenge agency action\nas it is defined in the APA.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs have not asserted a viable cause of action\nunder the APA.37\n2.  Title III\nTitle III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (“Title III”), 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2510-22, generally r egulates the governm ent’s interception of wire, oral, and electronic\ncommunications.  See United States v. Ojeda Rios, 495 U.S. 257, 259 (1990); 18 U.S.C. § 2516.  The\nfirst relevant question is whether Title III applies to the type of surveillance conducted by the NSA\nunder the TSP, considering Title III’s express limitations:\nNothing contained in this [statute (i.e.,Title III)] . . . shall be deemed to affect [1] the\nacquisition by the United States Governm ent of foreign intelligence information\nfrom international or foreign communications, or [2] foreign intelligence activities\nconducted in accordance with otherwise applicable Federal law involving a foreign\nelectronic com munications system , utiliz ing a m eans other than electronic\nsurveillance as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\nof 1978, and [ 3] procedures in this [ statute (i.e.,Title III)]  . . . and the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall be the exclusive m eans by which\nelectronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of such Act, and the interception\nof domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.\n18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).  When this statutory language is parsed into its three individual clauses, its\nlimitations becom e clear.  The f irst clause  disclaims Title III applicability generally —\nacknowledging that Title III does not apply to “the acquisition by the United States Government of\nforeign intelligence information from international or foreign communications.”  The second clause\n37\n It is noteworthy thatt he plaintiffs’ APA claim fails for an additional reason.  To the extent the plaintiffs rely\non the APA provision allowing judicial review for “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in\na court,” see 5 U.S.C. § 704 (emphasis added), they must demonstrate that the alleged agency action is “final.”  “As a\ngeneral matter, two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be ‘final.’”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177.  “First, the\naction must mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking process.”  Id. at 177-78.  “And second,t he action\nmust be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Id. at\n178 (quotation marks omitted).  Becauset he NSA’s surveillance activities do not constitute “agency action,” the analysis\nof whether they are final agency action is strained and awkward.  It nevertheless is clear that the NSA’s wiretapping does\nnot consummate any sort of agency decisionmaking process nor does it purport to determine the rights or obligations\nof others.  For this additional reason, the plaintiffs cannot assert a claim for judicial review under the APA.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 29\ndisclaims Title III applicability specifically — recognizing that Title III does not govern “foreign\nintelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable Federal law involving a\nforeign electronic communications system, utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance as\ndefined in [FISA].”  The final clause, which i sknown as the “exclusivity provision,” recognizes the\nrespective roles of Title III and FISA, by stating that the “procedures in [Title III] and [FISA] shall\nbe the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of [FISA], and\nthe interception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.”38\nThe first clause of § 2511(2)(f) — stating that Title III does not govern the acquisition of\n“foreign intelligence inf ormation from international or f oreign communications” — expressly\ndisclaims application of Title III to surveillance activities of the type at issue in the present case.\nThe NSA monitors international communications for the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence\nabout terrorist organizations; this type of surveillance falls squarely under the disclaimer found in\nthe first clause of § 2511(2)(f).  By its own terms, then, Title III does not apply to the conduct of\nwhich the plaintiffs complain.39  Cf. United States v. U.S. Dist. Ct(. Keith), 407 U.S. 297, 306 (1972)\n(finding “the conclusion inescapable,” as to the pre-FISA version of Title III, “that Congress only\nintended to make clear that [ Title III] simply did not legislate with respect  to national security\nsurveillances”).\nBecause the first clause of § 2511(2)(f) expressly disclaims Title III’s application to this\ncase, it is unnecessary to construe the second andt hird clauses.  But, it is worth acknowledging that\nthese two clauses raise  complex legal issues which cannot be resolved on the present record.  The\nsecond clause explains that Title III does not apply i ffour factors are all satisfied:  (1) the defendant\nis engaged in “foreign intelligence activities”; (2) the defendant is acting “in accordance with\notherwise applicable Federal law”; (3) the defendant’s surveillance involves a “foreign electronic\ncommunications system”; and (4) the deefndant utilizes “a means other than electronic surveillance”\nas defined in FISA.  These factor s raise a host  of intricate issues, such as whether the NSA’s\nwiretapping actually involves “electronic surveillance” as defined in FISA, and whether the NSA\nis acting in accordance with federal law, such  as the Authorization for Use of Military Force\n(“AUMF”), Pub. L. 107-40, § 2, 115 Stat. 224 (2001).  Some of these issues involve sophisticated\nlegal questions or complex factual questions.  But ,resolving these issues is unnecessary because the\nfirst clause of § 2511(2)(f) conclusively disclaims Title III’s application.\nIt is likewise unnecessary, at this point, to delve into the numerous issues raised by the third\nclause, i.e., the exclusivity provision.  The exclusivity provision differs from the first two clauses\nof § 2511(2)(f), in that it does not merely disclaim Title III’s application.  Instead, it states that Title\nIII and FISA shall be the “exclusive means” by which particular types of surveillance may occur,\nthus prescribing the separate roles o fTitle III andF ISA, rather than the application o fTitle III alone.\nThe plaintiffs assert a statutory cause of action for the NSA’s alleged violation of the exclusivity\n38\n This third clause is discussed in further detail in Section IV.B.4, infra, titled “The Exclusivity Provision.”\n39\n Even assuming, arguendo, that Title III applies to the NSA’si nternationally focused surveillance activities,\nthe plaintiffs cannot maintain the action for relief brought in this case.  Title III prescribes equitable relief in only a few\ninstances, none of which applies here.  Two provisions in Title III authorize injunctive relief for claims brought by the\ngovernment.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2521 (“the Attorney General may initiate a civil action . . . to enjoin” a violation of\nTitle III); § 2511(5)(a)(ii)(A) (“the Federal Government shall be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief” when a “person”\nviolates 18 U.S.C. § 2511(5)).  Because the plaintiffs are not representatives of or otherwise affiliated with the federal\ngovernment, neither of these provisions permits injunctive relief in this case.  Another Title III provision authorizes “any\nperson whose wire, oral, or electronic communication is intercepted, disclosed, or intentionally used in violation of [Title\nIII]” to recover declaratory or equitable relief from a “person or entity, other than the United States, which engaged in\nthat violation.”  18 U.S.C. § 2520(a) (emphasis added).  This provision does not help the plaintiffs becauseu nder these\nprovisions neither declaratory nor injunctive relief is available against the United States government and the plaintiffs\ncannot prove interception.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 30\nprovision, which I address separately in Section IV.B.4i,n fra.  It is, therefore, unnecessary to dissect\nthe exclusivity provision at this point in the analysis.\nBecause the first clause of § 2511(2)(f) stat es that Title III does not  apply to the\ninternationally focused surveillance activities challenged in this case, the plaintfisf have not asserted\na viable cause of action under Title III.\n3.  FISA\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (“FISA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq., —\nas the separate and distinct counterpar t to Title III — governs the interception of electronic\ncommunications involving foreign intelligence information.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1802(a)(1).  FISA is\nfraught with detailed statutory definitions and is expressly limited, by its own terms, to situations\nin which the President has authorized “electronic surveillance,” as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f),\nfor the purposes of acquiring “foreign intelligence information,” as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e).\nFirst, the surveillance in question must acquire “foreign intelligence information,” which\nincludes “information that relates to . . . the ability of  the United States to protect against . . .\ninternational terrorism.”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)(1)(B ).  In the present case, the NSA intercepts\ncommunications in which it has a r“easonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication\nis a member of al Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or a member of an organization affiliated with al\nQaeda, or working in support of al Qaeda.” S ee Press Briefing by Att’y Gen. Alberto Gonzales and\nGen. Michael Hayden, Principal Deputy Dir. for Nat’l Intellige nce (Dec. 19, 2005), available at\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1. html (last visited July 2, 2007)\n(emphasis added).  The proclaimed purpose is to prevent future terrorist attacks, see id. (“This is a\nvery concentrated, very limited program focused at gaining information about our enemy.”), and\nthus the NSA’s conduct satisfies this statutory requirement.\nNext, the interception must occur by “electronic surveillance.”  According to the plaintiffs,\nthe government’s admission that it intercepts telephone and email communications — which involve\nelectronic m edia and are generally considered, in com mon parlance, form s of electroni c\ncommunications — is tantamount to admitting that the NSA engaged in “electronic surveillance”\nfor purposes of FISA.  This argument fails upon recognition that “electronic surveillance” has a very\nparticular, detailed meaning under FISA — a legal definition that requires careful consideration of\nnumerous factors such as the types of communications acquired, the location of the parties to the\nacquired com munications, the location where the acqui sition occurred, the location of any\nsurveillance device, and the reasonableness of the parties’ expectation of privacy.  See 50 U.S.C.\n§ 1801(f).40  The plaintiffs have nots hown, and cannot show, that the NSA’s surveillance activities\n40\n FISA defines “electronic surveillance” in exactly four ways:\n(1) the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any\nwire or radio communication sent by or intended to be received by a particular, known United States\nperson who is in the United States, if the contents are acquired by intentionally targeting that United\nStates person, under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a\nwarrant would be required for law enforcement purposes;\n(2) the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the contents of any\nwire communication to or from a person in theU  nited States, without the consent of any party thereto,\nif such acquisition occurs in the United States, but does not include the acquisition of those\ncommunications of computer trespassers that would be permissible under section 2511(2)(i) of title\n18, United States Code;\n(3) the intentional acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device of the cnotents\nof any radio communication, under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes, and if both the sendera nd all\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 31\ninclude the sort of conduct that would satisfy FISA’s definition of “electronic surveillance,” and the\npresent record does not demonstrate that the NSA’s conduct falls within FISA’s definitions.\nFinally, even assuming, arguendo, that FISA applies to the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping,\nthe plaintiffs cannot sustain a claim under FISA.  FISA’s civil suit provision permits an “aggrieved\nperson” to bring a cause of action for a violation of that statute:\nAn aggrieved person, other than a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, as\ndefined in [50 U.S.C. § 1801(a) or (b)(1)(A)], respectively, who has been subjected\nto an electronic surveillance or about whom  information obtained by electronic\nsurveillance of such person has been disclosed  or used in violation of [50 U.S.C.\n§ 1809] shall have a cause of action against any person who com mitted such\nviolation and shall be entitled to recover --\n(a) actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages of $ 1,000 or $ 100 per day\nfor each day of violation, whichever is greater;\n(b) punitive damages; and\n(c) reasonable attorney’s fees and other investigation and litigation costs reasonably\nincurred.\n50 U.S.C. § 1810 (em phasis added).  There are at  least three reasons why the plaintif fs cannot\nmaintain their claims under FISA’s statutory authorziation.  First, the plaintfifs have not alleged, and\nthe record does not contain sufficient facts from  which to conclude, that they are “aggrieved\npersons.”  FISA defines an “ aggrieved person” as “a person who is the target of an electronic\nsurveillance or any other person whose com munications or activities were subject to electronic\nsurveillance.”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(k).  “[T]he term [aggrieved person] is intended to be coextensive\n[with], but no broader than, those persons who  have standing to r aise claims under the Fourth\nAmendment with respect to electronic surveillance.”  H.R. Rep. No. 95-1283, at 66 (1978) (citing\nAlderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969)) (Report by the Permanent Select Committee on\nIntelligence, in support of the proposed FISA bill and amendments).  The plaintiffs have not shown\nthat they were actually the target of, or subject to, the NSA’s surveillance; thus — f or the same\nreason they could not maintain their Fourth Amendment claim — they cannot establish that they are\n“aggrieved persons” under FISA’s statutory scheme.  Second, as previously discussed, the plaintiffs\nhave not demonstrated that the NSA’s wiretapping satisfies the statutory definition of “electronic\nsurveillance,” which is also required by FISA’sl iability provision.  Third, FISA does not authorize\nthe declaratory or i njunctive relief sought by the  plaintiffs, but allows only for the recovery of\nmoney damages.  No matter how these claims are characterized, the plaintiffs have not asserted a\nviable FISA cause of action.\nintended recipients are located within the United States; or\n(4) the installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance device in the United States\nfor monitoring to acquire inform ation, other than from  a  wire or radio communication, under\ncircumstances in which a person has a reasonable  expectation of privacy and a warrant would be\nrequired for law enforcement purposes.\n50 U.S.C. § 1801(f).  The present record, which contains threef acts regarding the TSP, offers no indication as to where\nthe interception may occur or where any surveillance device is located.  Nor d oes it offer any basis to conclude that\nparticular people located in the United States are being targeted.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 32\n4.  The Exclusivity Provision\nThe plaintiffs attempt to bring an ambiguous statutory cause of action under Title III and\nFISA jointly, based on their allegation that the TSP violates the “exclusivity provision”  of\n§ 2511(2)(f).  The exclusivity provision states tha tTitle III and FISA “shall be the exclusive means\nby which electronic surveilla nce, as defined in  section 101 of [FISA], and the interception of\ndomestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.”  18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).\nThis provision contains two separate and independent, albeit parallel, stateemnts:  (1) Title III “shall\nbe the exclusive  means by which . . . the inte rception of dom estic wire, oral, and electronic\ncommunications may be conducted,” and (2) FISA “shall be the exclusive m eans by which\nelectronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of [FISA] . . . may be conducted.”  This provision\ndoes not foreclose the possibility that the government may engage in certain surveillance activities\nthat are outside of the strictures of both Title III and FISA.\nThe plaintiffs cannot assert a viable cause oafc tion under this provision.  It is undisputed that\nthe NSA intercepts international, rather than domestic, communications, so, as already explained,\nTitle III does not apply.  Moreover, because the planitiffs have not shown, and cannot show, that the\nNSA engages in activities satisf ying the statutory def inition of “electronic surveillance,” the\nplaintiffs cannot dem onstrate that FISA does  apply.  Consequently, this e ntire provision is\ninapplicable to the present circumstances.\nThe plaintiffs, however, read this provision as satting that Title III and FISA are together the\n“exclusive means” by which the NSA can intercepta ny communication, and that these two statutes\ncollectively govern every interception (i.e., if not FISA then Title III, and if not Title III then FISA\n— there are no other options).  Spe cifically, the plaintiffs contend that the NSA cannot lawfully\nconduct any wiretapping (under the TSP or otherwise) in a manner that is outside both the Title III\nand the FISA frameworks; the NSA’s conduct must fall within the governance of one statute or the\nother.  Based on this reading, the plaintiffs believe that they need not dem onstrate the specific\napplicability of either statute — that is, they need not demonstrate either that the NSA is engaging\nin “electronic surveillance,” in  order to place it under FISA ,41 or that the NSA is engaging in\ndomestic surveillance, in order to place it under Title III.\nThe plaintiffs’ theory is prem ised on the assertion that FISA and Title III, collectively,\nrequire warrants for the legal interception of any and all communications, and appears to be that\nbecause the NSA has publicly admitted to intercepting certain overseas communications without\nwarrants, one must infer that the NSA has violated  one or the other of t hese two statutes.  The\nconsequence of this inference — the plaintiffs would have us find — is a violation of § 2511(2)(f),\nwhich is not a violation of  either Title III or FISA individually, but instead a violation of  the\ncollective application of the tw o.  Thus, according to the plaintiffs, the NSA has violated the\n“exclusivity provision” of  § 2511(2)(f), and basedo n this (presumed) violation, the plaintiffs have\nstanding to bring a cause of action under this statutory provision.\nThe intended inferential “logic” of the plaintfifs’ theory falls apart upon recognition of their\nfaulty premise.  As previously explained, “electronic surveillance” under FISA does not cover all\ntypes of foreign surveillance, but instead has a ver yparticular and detailedd efinition.  The plaintiffs\npoint to no provision in FISA, Title III, or any ot her statute that states that the f our definitions\n“electronic surveillance” listed in FISA are the onlkyi nd of “electronic surveillance” that could ever\nbe conducted.  And the fact that the “exclusivity pr ovision” is expressly lim ited to electronic\nsurveillance “as defined in section 101 of [FI SA]” leaves room  to infer that other electronic\n41\n This, of course, begst he question of why Congress would define “electronic surveillance” — in four explicit\nways — if, as the plaintiffs contend, a demonstration that the interception is “electronic surveillance” is unnecessary.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 33\nsurveillance is possible.  Therefore, the plaintiffcsa nnot prove that FISA applies.  More importantly,\nthis inability to prove that the interceptions are “electronic surveillance” does not, as the plaintiffs\ntheorize, lead to an inescapable conclusion that Title III applies.  It simply means that FISA does\nnot apply.  On the other hand, it is irrefutable undetrh e first clause of § 2511(2)(f) that Title III does\nnot apply to this case because the NSA’s wiretapping activities are focused oni nternational, rather\nthan domestic, communications.  To read this entire statute in the way that the plaintiffs suggest is\nto create an internal contradiction, which courts are loath to do.  Rather, the unavailability of the\nevidence necessary to prove (or disprove) that  the NSA is engaging in “electronic surveillance”\ncompels a conclusion that the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that either statute applies.\nBut even assum ing, arguendo, that the plaintiffs  have posited a proper reading of the\nexclusivity provision, and that the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping violates that provision, “the fact\nthat a federal statute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to\na private cause of action in favor of that person.”  Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 688\n(1979).  The question of whether a statute implicitly creates a cause of action “is basically a matter\nof statutory construction.”  Transam. Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewi s, 444 U.S. 11, 15 (1979).\n“The ultimate question is one of congressional intent, not one of whether this [c]ourt thinks that it\ncan improve upon the statutory scheme that Congress enacted into law.”   Touche Ross & Co. v.\nRedington, 442 U.S. 560, 578 (1979).\nThe exclusivity provision does not appear to creaet such an implied cause of action.  In cases\nwhere a court implies a cause of action, “the statute in question at least prohibit[s] certain conduct\nor create[s] federal rights in  favor of private parties.”  Id. at 569.  This “exclusivity provision,”\nhowever, does not proscribe conduct as unlawful or confer rights on private parties.  Moreover, the\nstructure of Title III — the statute in which  the exclusivity provision is found — suggests that\nCongress did not intend to create a private cause  of action.  Ti tle III expressly states that the\n“remedies and sanctions described in this chapter . . . are the only judicial remedies and sanctions\nfor nonconstitutional violations of [Title III].”  18 U.S.C. § 2518(10)(c).  Thus, Title III explicitly\nlists the only available remedies and means of statutory relief.  Because it is unreasonable to assume\nthat Congress implicitly (i.e., silently) intended to create a third avenue of statutory relief with the\nexclusivity provision (in addition to the express causes of action contained in Title III and FISA\nthemselves), the provision does not provide any basis for a cause of action.\nWhen considering statutory claim s, “the inquiry as to sta nding m ust begin with a\ndetermination of whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff.” \nSierra Club, 405 U.S. at 732.  The plaintiffs asserted trhee statutory bases — the APA, Title III, and\nFISA — and none of these three sattutes, individually or collectively, provides an express or implied\ncause of action that “authorizes review” of the plaintiffs claims.  See id.  Therefore, the plaintiffs\ncannot establish standing to litigate their statutory claims, and further explanation is unnecessary.\nThe plaintiffs have, however, raised certain other arguments that warrant mention.\nC.  Additional Considerations\nHaving proceeded methodically through the standing analysis, I address the plaintiffs’ only\nremaining arguments, which defy classification under a compartmentalized approach.  Under the\nfirst of these arguments, the plaintiffs rely heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision in Friends of\nthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., 528 U.S. 167 (2000), as support for their\nallegation of injury in fact.  In Laidlaw, the Court considered whether the plaintiffs had Article III\nstanding to bring a claim  under the citizen-suit provision of the Clean W ater Act, 33 U.S.C.\n§ 1365(a).  Therefore,  Laidlaw is immediately distinguishable with rega rd to the constitutional\nclaims.  See Sierra Club, 405 U.S. at 732 (noting the differencei n the standing analysis, as between\nconstitutional and statutory claims).  If Laidlaw is to offer the plaintiffs any support at all, it is only\nwith respect to their statutory claims.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 34\nLaidlaw is a case involving particular statutor y claims and well-defined environm ental\ninjuries, however, and differs significantly from the present context, which involves dramatically\ndifferent statutory claims and far less palpable alleged injuries.  In this sense, it is noteworthy that\nthe Laidlaw Court explicitly confined its injury-in-fact reasoning to environmental cases, stating:\n“environmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected\narea and are persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened by\nthe challenged activity.”   Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 183 (quotation m arks omitted; emphasis added).\nBecause the injuries and claims in Laidlaw differ in a significant way fr om those alleged by the\nplaintiffs in the present case, Laidlaw offers only minimal support for the plaintiffs’ position.\nSetting aside the fact t hat  Laidlaw is an environm ental case involving a particular,\nstatutorily-created claim, the Court’s analysis in  Laidlaw remains unpersuasive in the pres ent\ncontext.  The Laidlaw Court found that the plaintiffs had satnding to challenge Laidlaw’s discharge\nof pollutants into a river because the discharge “curtail[ed] their recreational use of that waterway\nand would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms.”  Id. at 184.  In its standing analysis,\nthe Court distinguished City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 107 n.7 (1983), which had held\nthat a plaintiff lacked standing to seek an injunction against thee nforcement of a police choke-hold\npolicy because he could not credibly allege that he faced a realistic threat fr om the policy.  The\nLyons Court had noted that “‘[t]he reasonableness of Lyons’ fear is dependent upon the likelihood\nof a recurrence of the allegedly unlawful conduct,’ and his ‘subjective apprehensions’ that such a\nrecurrence would even take place were not enough to support standing.” L aidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184\n(quoting Lyons, 461 U.S. at 108 n.8).  In contrast, theL aidlaw Court found a concrete, actual injury\nbased on the plaintiffs’ showing that the defenda nt’s unlawful discharge of pollutants into a\nparticular river was ongoing and may reasonably have caused nearby residents to curtail their use\nof that waterway.  The facts of the present case are more analogous to Lyons than Laidlaw.  Unlike\nthe plaintiffs in Laidlaw, the present plaintiffs have curtailed their com munications despite the\nabsence of any evidence that the government has intercepted their particular communications — or\nby analogy to Laidlaw, without any evidence that the defendant has polluted their particular river.\nRather, like the plaintiffs in Lyons, the present plaintiffs claim a threat from the government’s policy\nand a re chilled by their subjective apprehension that the governm ent is intercepting their\ncommunications.  This c onclusion is therefore consistent with the holding and reasoning of\nLaidlaw.42\nThe plaintiffs’ assertion that numerous other district courts have found standing to challenge\nthe TSP is also unpersuasive.  Other cases involving non-similarly situated plaintiffs are typically\nirrelevant to the issue of standing because standnig reflects whether “a particular person is a proper\nparty to maintain the action.”  Flast, 392 U.S. at 100; see also Raines, 521 U.S. at 819 (“We have\nconsistently stressed that a plaintiff’s complaint must establish that he has a ‘personal stake’ in the\nalleged dispute, and that the alleged injury suffered is particularized as to him.”).  In any event, the\nexisting district court decisions  regarding this  TSP reveal a wholly different picture from  that\npresented by the plaintiffs.  Neither of the two district courts to address claims against the NSA’s\noperation of the TSP found that their plaintiffs had standing.  In Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation,\nInc. v. Bush, 451 F. Supp. 2d 1215, 1226 (D. Or. 2006), unlike the present  case, the plaintiffs\npurported to have evidence proving that their own communications had actually been intercepted.\n42\n Even assuming, arguendo, that Laidlaw assists in establishing a cognizabl eand concrete injury, the obsatcles\nto causation and redressability present here were absent there.  Moreover, Laidlaw’s redressability analysis is entirely\ninapplicable to the present case.  The redressability analysis in Laidlaw considered whether civil penalties paid to the\ngovernment, rather than the plaintiffs, could redress the plaintiffs’ alleged injuriesL. a idlaw, 528 U.S. at 185.  The Court\ndetermined that “the civil penalties sought by [the plaintiffs] carried with them a deterrent effect that made it likely, as\nopposed to merely speculative, that the penalties would redress[ the plaintiffs’] injuries by abating currentv iolations and\npreventing future ones.”  Id. at 187.  This analysis, as to the deterrent  effect of civil damages, does not apply in the\npresent case, which does not involve any claims for damages but only for injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 35\nBased in part on that evidence, the district cout rfound that the “plaintiffs should have an opportunity\nto establish standing and make a prima facie case, even if they must do so in camera.”  Id.  The\ncourt did not, however, definitively decide the standing issue at that stage of its proceeding.  In\nTooley v. Bush, No. 06-306, 2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 92274, 2006 WL 3783142, at *24 (D.D.C. Dec.\n21, 2006), the district court found tha tthe plaintiff lacked standingb ecause he did not provide “any\nfactual basis for his conclusion that he ha[d] been the subject of illegal wiretaps.”  Two other cases\nchallenged a telecommunications provider’s (rather than the NSA’s) participation in the TSP.  In\nTerkel v. AT&T Corp., 441 F. Supp. 2d 899, 919-20 (N.D. Ill. 2006)t,h e district court found that the\nplaintiffs were unable to establish standing aganist AT&T because they could not show that AT&T\nhad disclosed their records to the government.  InH  epting v. AT&T Corp,. 439 F. Supp. 2d 974, 999-\n1000 (N.D. Cal. 2006), the district court found that the plaintiffs had standing against AT&T, but\nrefused to consider the government’s actions in its standing inquiry.  Consequently, these cases\nprovide no support for the plaintiffs’ position in the present case.\nBased on t he evidence in the record, as applied in the foregoing analysis, none of the\nplaintiffs in the present case is able to establis h standing for any of the asserted claim s.  At oral\nargument, we asked the plaintiffs’ counsel if we should remand for further proceedings on the issue\nof standing.  Counsel asserted that the plaintiffs’ ijnuries were clear and undisputed in the record and\nthere was no need to remand for a hearing or admission of additional evidence on this issue.  But\neven to the extent that additional evidence may exist, which might establish standing for one or more\nof the plaintiffs on one or m ore of their cl aims, discovery of such e vidence would, under the\ncircumstances of this case, be prevented by the State Secrets Doctrine.S  ee, e.g., Reynolds, 345 U.S.\nat 10-11; Tenenbaum, 372 F.3d at 777; Halkin v. Helms, 690 F.2d 977, 981 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\nV.\nThe district court dismissed the data mining aspect of the plaintiffs’ claim, finding that the\nplaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case without resorting to privileged information.  ACLU\nv. NSA, 438 F. Supp. 2d at 765.  The plaintiffs press this issue as a cross-appeal.\nA thorough review of the complaint, the district court opinion, and the arguments presented\non appeal, makes it clear that the plaintiffs allege no separate injury in connection with the alleged\ndata-mining aspect of the TSP.  Therefore, thiss tanding analysis applies equally, and the plaintiffs’\ncross-appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  See Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 109-10.\nVI.\nWe hold that the plaintiffs do not have standi ng to assert their clai ms in federal court.\nAccordingly, we VACATE the order of the district court and REMAND this case to the district\ncourt with instructions to DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 36\n____________________________________\nCONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT\n_____________________________________\nJULIA SMITH GIBBONS, Circuit uJdge, concurring.  The disposition o fall of the plaintiffs’\nclaims depends upon the single fact that the plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence  that they are\npersonally subject to the TSP.  W ithout this evidence, on a m otion for summary judgment, the\nplaintiffs cannot establish standing for a ny of their claims, constitutional or statutory.1  For this\nreason, I do not reach the myriad other standing and merits issues, the complexity of which is ably\ndemonstrated by Judge Batchelder’s and Judge Gilman’s very thoughtful opinions, and I therefore\nconcur in the judgment only.\nThe case or controversy requirement in Article III of the Constitution determines the power\nof the federal courts to entertain a suit, es tablishing an “irreducible constitutional m inimum of\nstanding” that is required for both constitutional and statutory claims.  See Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992);W  arth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975);O  ’Shea v. Littleton,\n414 U.S. 488, 493 n.2 (1974).  The Constitution “r equires the party who invokes t he court’s\nauthority to show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the\nputatively illegal conduct of the defendant.”   Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for\nSeparation of Church & State, Inc,. 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982) (quotatoin marks omitted) (emphasis\nadded).  This persona l injury must be “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a)\nconcrete and particularized and (b) actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” D  efenders\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560 (citations and quotation marks omitted); see also Friends of the Earth,\nInc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. T(OC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (noting that the relevant showing\nis the injury to the plaintiff, not the environment).  In order for a plaintiff to show that the injur y\nfrom a government policy is actual and imminent, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he personally\nwould be subject to the future application of that policy.C  ity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95,\n106 n.7 (1983); see Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184; Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 189 n.7 (1984).  A\nplaintiff’s fear that he will be subject to the policy is insufficient; “[i]t is the reality of the threat of\nrepeated injury that is relevant to the standinign quiry, not the plaintiff’s subjective apprehensions.”2\nLyons, 461 U.S. at 107 n.8; see Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184.\nJudge Gilman’s opinion arrives at the opposite ocnclusion, relying exclusively on its  reading\nof Laidlaw.  It concludes that the attorney-plaintiffs need not show that they have ever been or will\n1\n Although Judge Batchelder clearly disagrees about the depth of treatment required, at least with respect to\nthe plaintiffs’ constitutional claims and FISA claim, she appears to agree that the plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate that\nthey have been subject to the TSP is fatal to their constitutional standing.  (See Batchelder Op. 9-10 (discussing all the\nclaims generally and FISA specifically); id. at 13-14, 18 (First Amendment); id. at 23 (Fourth Amendment); id. at 24\n(Separation of Powers).)  We may differ, however, with respect to the plaintiffs’ other statutory claims because Judge\nBatchelder determines that the statutes do not apply without reaching the issue of constitutional standing.  My reading\nof Supreme Court precedent suggests that we must reach the constitutional standing issue first with respect to all the\nclaims.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 89, 92-93 (1998) (warning that a court must determine\nconstitutional standing before addressing the “existence of a cause of action”); see also Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S.\n727, 732 & n.3 (1972) (noting that the inquiry as to “whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of\nthe plaintiff” occurs where a dispute is “otherwise justiciable” because Article III jurisdiction is present).  Because in\nmy view the plaintiffs have no constitutional standing to raise any of their claims, I find it unnecessary to discuss the\napplicability of the other statutes.\n2\n This is not to say that a plaintiff lacks standing  until a defendant has acted.    A  “genuine threat” of\nenforcement of a policy against a plaintiff who is demonstrably subject to that policy supports standing.  See Steffel v.\nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 475 (1974).  But that case differs from one in which a plaintiff cannot establish that he is\nsubject to the policy but merely fears that he is subject to the policy that may be enforced, which cannot support standing.\nSee, e.g., United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. v. Reagan, 738 F.2d 1375, 1380 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 37\never be actual subjects o fsurveillance but rather onyl the “reasonableness of their fear” that they will\nbe subjects of surveillance.  (Gilman Op. 44, 50.)  In doing so, Judg eGilman transforms the holding\nin Laidlaw, under which the plaintiffs who werei n fact subject to defendant’s conduc thad standing\nbecause they reasonably feared harm from that conduct, into a m uch broader proposition, under\nwhich plaintiffs may establish standing by showing merely that they possess a reasonable fear of\nbeing subject to defendant’s allegedly harmful conduc.t  This distinction is critical to “t[]he relevant\nshowing for purposes of Article III standing, . . . injury to the plaintiff,” Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 181,\nas the Supreme Court made clear in distinguishingL aidlaw from Lyons.  InL  aidlaw, the Court noted\nthat in Lyons, a policy of chokehold use existed, but thep laintiff’s “‘subjective apprehensions’ that\nsuch a recurrence [of the unlawful conduct] would even  take place were not enough to support\nstanding.”   Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184.  The plaintiff’s fear of being subject to conduct of the\ndefendant under the chokehold policy was insuffici ent to support standing.  The  Supreme Court\nfurther explained that standing was present in Laidlaw because “in contrast, it is undisputed that\nLaidlaw’s unlawful conduct . . . was occurring . . . .  [T]hen, the only ‘subjective’ issue here is ‘the\nreasonableness of the fear’ that led the affiants to respond to that concededly ongoing conduct” by\nrefraining from use of the polluted areas.  Id. (brackets omitted).  The Court noted that it differed\nfrom the dissent in seeing nothing “‘improbable’ about the proposition that a company’s continuous\nand pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby residents to curtail\ntheir recreational use of that waterway and would subject them  to other economic and aesthetic\nharms.”   Id.  Thus, in  Laidlaw, the plaintiff’s  fear of har m from the defendant’s undisputed\nconduct—conduct that would also undisputably affect plaintiffs personally if they undertook their\ndesired activities—was sufficient to support standing.  Id. at 184-85.  In summary, I read Laidlaw\nto require that plaintiffs demonstrate that they (1) are in fact subject to the defendant’s conduct, in\nthe past or future, and (2) have at least a reasonable fear of harm from that conduct.\nThe  Laidlaw majority’s discussion of Lyons and its observations about theL aidlaw plaintiffs\nexplain exactly why plaintiffs here are like the plaintiff in Lyons, who lacked standing, and unlike\nthose in Laidlaw, who had standing.  Like the plaintiffs in Laidlaw and Lyons, the plaintiffs in the\npresent case may have a reasonable fear of harm from the defendants’ conduct.  See id. at 184-85\n(finding plaintiffs’ fear of “economic and aesthetic harms” from “illegal discharges of pollutants”\nto be “entirely reasonable”);L yons, 461 U.S. at 100 (describing the daeths of those who were subject\nto chokeholds).  But Laidlaw and Lyons differ in outcome based on whether the plaintiffs have\nestablished that they are in fact subject to the conduct of the defendants.  Here, plaintiffs fear being\nsubject to a government policy of surveillance and have alleged that they and those with whom they\ncommunicate have ceased their normal communication.  If  they i nstead continued their normal\nactivities, they would still be fearful, but whether they would actually be subject to surveillance is\npurely speculative.  They are like the Lyons plaintiff who can show nothing more than a fear of the\nuse of a chokehold.  See Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184 (discussing the “‘subjective apprehensions’ that\nsuch a recurrence would even  take place” in Lyons).  By contrast, if the Laidlaw plaintiffs had\nresumed their abandoned activities, they would definitely have been subject to the defendant’s\nconduct—illegal discharges into the river.   See id. (contrasting Laidlaw’s “concededly ongoing\nconduct” of “continuous and pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river . . . nearby”).\nJudge Gilman’s attempt to distinguish Lyons from the case at bar is directly contrary to the\nSupreme Court’s own reading of that case.  It is immaterial that the likelihood that Lyons would be\nsubject to the chokehold policy m ay be far more remote than the likeli hood that the attorney-\nplaintiffs in this case may be subjectt o the warrantless surveillance policy.  S(ee Gilman Op. 45-46.)\nAs Laidlaw makes clear, a plaintiff must be actually subject to the defendant’s conduct, not simply\nafraid of  being subject to it, regardless of how reasonable that fear may be.  The Supreme Court’s\ndistinction between Laidlaw and Lyons was one of kind, not degree.  See Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184\n(distinguishing between the “subjective apprehensions that such  arecurrence would even take place”\nin Lyons and the “subjective issue [of] the reasonableness of the fear” that pollutants would cause\n“economic and aesthetic harms” in Laidlaw) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Here,\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 38\nthe attorney-plaintiffs lack st anding because they have failed to  present evidence that they are\npersonally subject to the warrantless surveillance policy; that is, the attorney-plaintiffs have failed\nto present evidence as to whether, in the governm ent’s view, “there are reasonable grounds to\nbelieve that a party to the [attorney-plaintiffs’] communication[s] is affiliated with al Qaeda.”\nJudge Gilm an attem pts to distinguish  United Pr esbyterian Church  on its facts by\nconfounding the different injuries alleged in that case.  The plaintiffs in that case alleged three\ndifferent kinds of injuries:  (1) “the ‘ch illing’ of constitutionally protected activities,”  United\nPresbyterian Church , 738 F.2d at 1377; (2) “the im mediate threat of being targeted for\nsurveillance,” id.; and (3) direct injury from surveillance taken against them, id. at 1380 & n.2.  As\nthe plaintiffs in this case have no evidence that they have ever been subject to the TSP, Judge\nGilman correctly distinguishes the D.C. Circuit’sr easoning on the third alleged injury.  (Gilman Op.\n46 (discussing the “direct injury” and quoting in parUt nited Presbyterian Church, 738 F.3d at 1380-\n81 (“The third kind of harm [the plaintiffs] allege is . . . too generalized and nonspecific to support\na complaint. . . .  There is no allegation or even suggestion that any unlawful action to which the\n[plaintiffs] have been subjected in the past wast he consequence of the presidential action they seek\nto challenge.”)).)  Judge Gilman ignores the D.C. Circuit’s reasoning on the second alleged injury,\nfor which it found that the plaintiffs lacked standing based upon the same distinction made by the\nSupreme Court in Laidlaw.  The D.C. Circuit noted that the plaintiffs would have standing if they\nwere subject to an “immediate threat of concrete, harmful action.” U  nited Presbyterian Church, 738\nF.2d at 1380.  However, it concluded that the plainftfis’ allegations that “their activities are such that\nthey are especially likely to be tragets of the [surveillance] authorized by the order” were insufficient\nto support standing because those allegations only “place[d] the plaintiffs at greater risk” of being\nsubject to surveillance. I d.  There is no relevant factual difference between thUe nited Presbyterian\nChurch plaintiffs, whose activities the D.C. Circuit conceded made them more likely to be subject\nto surveillance, id., and the attorney-plaintiffs in this case, whose representatino of “exactly the types\nof clients” targeted by the TSP makes them more likely to be targeted by the TSP, (Gilman Op. 47).\nUnlike the plaintiffs in United Presbyterian Church and this case, in every case cited by\nJudge Gilman in which standing was found, the plaintiff was cle arly subject to conduct of the\ndefendant about which the plaintiff complained.  See Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 473 (1987)\n(noting that the three films the plaintiff sought to show were identified as “political propaganda”);\nSteffel, 415 U.S. at 459 (noting that the plaintiff’s fear of prosecution was not speculative because\nhe had been personally threatened with prosecution);O  zonoff v. Berzak, 744 F.2d 224, 228 (1st Cir.\n1984) (noting that “[a]s one  who has worked for the W HO in the past and who has filed an\nemployment application again seeking work,” the palintiff felt constrained by the loyalty standards);\nPaton v. La Prade, 524 F.2d 862, 865, 870-71, 873 (3d Cir. 1975) (noting that “Paton’s name and\naddress were ascertained as a result of the mail cover” and concluding the plaintiff had standing\nbecause “she may have sustained or be im mediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as a\nresult” of the FBI investigation directed against her, which resulted from the mail cover).\nIn applying any understanding of constitutional standing, it is im portant to recognize the\nburden of proof required.  “Thep arty invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing\nthe[] elements” of standing.   Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 561.  “[E]ach elem ent must be\nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,i .e.,\nwith the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  Id.  As\nthis case was decided on the government’s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs “must ‘set\nforth’ by affidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts,’ which for purposes of the summary judgment\nmotion will be taken to be true.”  Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  Applying my formulation of\nthe standing requirements, the plaintiffs have failed to meet this burden because there is no evidence\nin the record that any of the plaintiffs are personally subject to the TSP.  Judge Gilman frequently\nrefers to the attorney-plaintiffs ’ allegations, (Gilm an Op. 44, 47, 48), and concludes that the\n“attorney-plaintiffs have alleged a[] . . . concrete and particularized injury,” (Gilman Op. 47).  On\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 39\nsummary judgment, however, the plaintiffs’ m ere allegations are insufficient, and although the\npublicly admitted information about the TSP “supports” them, (Gilman Op. 48), it does not satisfy\nthe plaintiffs’ burden.  In applying his formulation of the standing requirement, the reasonableness\nof plaintiffs’ fear, Judge Gilman concludes that “[t]he likelihood that [the plaintiff in Lyons] would\nagain find himself in a chokehold by the Los Angeles police seems to me far more remote than the\nongoing concern of the attorney-plaintiffs here that their telephone or email communications will\nbe intercepted by the TSP.”  (Gilman Op. 45-46.)  Unfortunately for the plaintiffs’ position, besides\nJudge Gilman’s subjective assessment, there is no evidence as to the likelihood the plaintiffs will\nbe surveilled for this court to consider on summary judgment.\nUnder any understanding of constitutional standing, the plaintiffs are ultimately prevented\nfrom establishing standing because of t he state secrets privilege.3  As Judge Batchelder notes,\nplaintiffs have not challenged the government’s invocation of the privilege or its application.  All\nthree members of the panel have reviewed the documents filed by the government under seal that\narguably are protected by the privilege.  The state secrets privilegeo perates as a bar to the admission\nof evidence to which the privilege attaches, and the plaintiff must proceed without the benefit of\nsuch evidence.  See United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 11 (1953); see also Ellsberg v. Mitchell,\n709 F.2d 51, 65 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  W here the privilege prevents the plaintif f from producing\nsufficient evidence to establish his or herp rima facie case, the court must dismiss the claim.  Kasza\nv. Browner, 133 F.3d 1159, 1166 (9th Cir. 1998).   In this way, the state secrets privilege has\nprevented the plaintiffs from conducting discovery that might allow them to establish that they are\npersonally subject to the TSP, as I believe cons titutional standing requires.  However, where the\nprivilege deprives the government of a valid defense to the plaintiff’s claim, the court must also\ndismiss the claim.  Tenenbaum v. Simonini, 372 F.3d 776, 777 (6th Cir. 2004); Kasza, 133 F.3d at\n1166.  Even applying Judge Gilman’s formulation of the standing requirement, the court cannot\navoid the state secrets privilege.4  Evidence arguably protected by the state secrets privilege may\nwell be relevant to the reasonableness of the plaintiffs’ fear.  Whether that evidence is favorable to\nplaintiffs or defendants, its unavailability requires dismissal.  That it may be unsatisfying that facts\npertinent to the standing inquiry are unavailable can have no bearing on the disposition of this case.\nIf the state secrets privilege prevents the plaintiffs from  presenting adequate evidence of thei r\n3\n Judge Batchelder’s decision does notd iscuss the implications of the state secrets privilegeb ecause, under her\nreading of Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1 (1972),t he plaintiffs can establish standing only if they are “regulated, constrained,\nor compelled directly by the government’s actions,” (Batchelder Op. at 13), not if their injury “aris[es]f rom a personal\nsubjective chill” caused by the existence of government surveillance, (Batchelder Op. 16; see Batchelder Op. 14-15).\nThe implication of this reasoning is that even if the plaintfifs had evidence that they were personally subjectt o the TSP,\nthey would not have standing if the government was only conducting surveillance.\nIt is not clear to me that Laird must be read this way.  The language inL aird about regulation, proscription, and\ncompulsion to me seems merely descriptive of the facts in prior cases in which the Supreme Court had found standing.\nLaird could be read as holding that when the  only harm alleged is chilled speech, then the exercise of governmental\npower must be regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature.  See Laird, 408 U.S. at 11, 13-14. H  ere, the plaintiffs’\nprofessional injuries are arguably a harm beyond chilled speech.  Furthermore, because the plaintiffs in Laird alleged\nonly chilled speech, Laird does not directly address whether other injuries that derive from the chilled speech must be\ndiscounted.  See id. at 13-14.  Given this am biguity, I see no need to express an  opinion as to the extent of Laird’s\nholding and whether the plaintiffs could establish standing  were they to provide evidence that they were personally\nsubject to surveillance.\nIn any event, even under Judge Batchelder’s reasoning, the state secrets privilege plays a prominent role that\nmust be acknowledged.  Because of the statese crets privilege, the plaintiffs are unable to conduct discovery tdoe termine\nif information from the TSP is used in such a way as to satisfy the requirements that Judge Batchelder finds in Laird.\n4\n Judge Gilman’s opinion does not dispute the majority opinion’s contention that the plaintiffs’ standing would\nbe undermined if the NSA hypotheticallya dhered to a policy of complete nondisclosure, but rather criticizes the analysis\nas speculation.  (Gilman Op. 51.)  It correctly notes that we cannot knoww  hether such a policy exists “[a]bsent a public\nrevelation from the NSA.”  (Gilman Op. 51.)  However, it misapprehends the impact of this observation.  The plaintiffs’\nclaims fail not because of the majority’s speculation that such a policy exists but rather because the statsee crets privilege\nprecludes the NSA from disclosing whether it exists.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 40\nstanding, we must dismiss their claims.  If the state secrets privilege prevents the government from\npresenting evidence that might refute the plaintiffs’ allegations that they are likely to be surveilled\nand undercut the reasonableness of their asserted fear, we must also dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 41\n_______________\nDISSENT\n_______________\nRONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge, dissent ing.  My colleagues conclude that the\nplaintiffs have not established standing to bring their chall enge to the Bush Adm inistration’s\nso-called Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP).  A  fundamental disagreement exists between the\ntwo of them and myself on what is required to show standing and whether any of the plaintiffs have\nmet that requirement.  Because of that di sagreement, I respectfully dissent.  Moreover, I would\naffirm the judgm ent of the district court becau se I am  persuaded that the TSP a s originally\nimplemented violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA).\nI.  ANALYSIS\nA. Procedural posture\nThis case comes to us in a relatively unique procedural postur e.  In the district court, the\nplaintiffs moved for partial sum mary judgment.  They filed a statem ent of undisputed facts in\nsupport of that motion.  The government then filed its own motion to dismiss or, in the alternative,\na motion for summary judgment.  In this motion, the government asserted that the plaintiffs could\nnot establish standing and that the state-secrets privilege barred their claims.  But the government\ndid not contest the plaintiffs’ statem ent of undisput ed facts or provide its own statem ent of\nundisputed facts.  The district court was therefore bound by the requirements of Rule 56(e) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides as follows:\nWhen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this\nrule, an adverse party m ay not rest upon t he mere allegations or denials of the\nadverse party’s pleading, but the adverse party’s response, by affidavits or as\notherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.  If the adveres party does not so respond, summary judgment,\nif appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.\nAfter reviewing the affidavits and related supporting material submitted in support of the\nplaintiffs’ motion, the district court found that they had set f orth the necessary facts to meet the\nprerequisites for standing.  The court then considere dthe plaintiffs’ claims on the merits and granted\ntheir motion as to all but their datamining claim. \nDespite this procedural posture, the lead opinion asserts that the record presently before us\ncontains only “three publicly acknowledged facts about the TSP—(1) it eavesdrops, (2) without\nwarrants, (3) on international telephone and em ail communications in which at least one of the\nparties is a suspected al Qaeda affiliate.”  Lead Op. at 3.  For the reasons both stated above and set\nforth below, I believe that this description si gnificantly understates the m aterial in the record\npresently before us.\nB. Standing\n1. Injury in fact\nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution “requires the party who invokes the court’s authority to\nshow that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively\nillegal conduct of the defendant.”  Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of\nChurch & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982) (quotation m arks omitted).  This is som etimes\nreferred to as the “direct injury” or the “distinct and palpable injury” requirement.  Laird v. Tatum,\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 42\n408 U.S. 1, 13 (1972); Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 475.  The Supreme Court has defined “injury in\nfact” as “an invasion of a legally protected intere st which is (a) concrete and particularized and\n(b) actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\n555, 560 (1992) (citations and quotation m arks omitted).  An association has standing t o sue on\nbehalf of its members when “its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,\nthe interests at stake are germane to the organization’s purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor\nthe relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Friends of the\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (citation omitted).  \nMoreover, as the lead opinion acknowledges, only one plaintiff need establish standing to\nsatisfy Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement.  Mass. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 127 S. Ct. 1438,\n1453 (2007) (“Only one of the petitioners needs to ha ve standing to permit us to consider the\npetition for review.”); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986) (finding the Article III\nrequirement satisfied where at least one plaintiff could establish standi ng).  The position of the\nattorney-plaintiffs, in my opinion, is the strongest for the purpose of the standing analysis.  This is\nnot to say that the journalists and the scholars do not have standing.  They might.  But because only\none plaintiff need establish standing, I will focus my discussion on the attorney-plaintiffs.  \nThe lead opinion criticizes the attorney-plainti ffs for asserting multiple causes of action\ndespite “hav[ing] one claim,” but this is hardly a “ruse,” whether “perfectly acceptable” or not as\nthe lead opinion would have it.  Lead Op. at  9.  The Suprem e Court’s recent decision in\nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,  126 S. Ct. 1854, 1868 n.5 (2006), indeed reiterates that a litigant\ncannot “by virtue of his standing to challenge one government action, challenge other governmental\nactions that did not injure him.”  In the present case, however, the plaintiffs seek to challenge the\nonly action that has injured them —the NSA’s implementation of the TSP—and they do so by\n“identifying all grounds” against that action.  Id. at 1868 n.5.  Thus, I do not believe that this case\nrequires “a particularized analysis of the plaintiffs’ three alleged injuries, six asserted legal claims,\nand two requested forms of relief.”  Lead Op. at 10.\nI now return to the first element of the standing analysis. D  espite the willingness of the lead\nopinion to assume that the attorney-plaintiffs’ asserted injuries could be “deemed adequate to state\nan injury in fact,” Lead Op. at 17, its analysis suggests the opposite.  I have accordingly set forth\nbelow the reasons why I conclude that the attorney-plaintiffs have dem onstrated that no such\nassumption is needed because they have actually stated an injury in fact.\nThe attorney-plaintiffs assert a claim for the injuries flowing from the failure of the TSP to\ncomply with FISA’s requirements that “minimization procedures” be utilized to protect privileged\ncommunications—such as between attorneys and theri clients—from interception or, if intercepted,\nfrom s ubsequent disclosure.  Contrary to the lead opinion’s characterization of the\nattorney-plaintiffs’ assertions, the harm alleged here in fact “causes the plaintiffs to refrain from”\npotentially harmful conduct.  Lead Op. at 8.  I find that the distinction the lead opinion attempts to\ndraw between a harm that causes an injury and a harm  that results from an injury is ultim ately\nunpersuasive.  To my mind, the attorney-plaintiffs have art iculated an actual or im minent harm\nflowing from the TSP. \nThe lead opinion’s contrary view is largely  based on its reading of  the D.C. Circuit’s\ninterpretation of Laird; namely, that “a plaintiff m ust establish that he or she  is regulated,\nconstrained, or com pelled directly by the govern ment’s actions, instead of by hi s or her own\nsubjective chill.”  Lead Op. at 13 (citing Laird, 408 U.S. at 11, and United Presbyterian Church v.\nReagan, 738 F.2d 1375, 1378 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).  In fact, the lead opinion says that Laird controls,\nand that the injury alleged here is at best no more concrete than that in Laird.  Lead Op. at 16.  The\nlead opinion then analogizes the injury to the attorney-plaintfisf’ ability to perform their professional\nduties as a chill on “com mercial speech.”  Drawing on this com mercial-speech analogy—an\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 43\nargument never raised by the governm ent—the lead opinion rejects the plaintiffs’ contention of\nhaving suffered an injury in fact because, as so characterized by the lead opinion, the consequence\n“would effectively value commercial speech above political speech.”  Lead Op. at 13. But there is\nno legal support offered for the lead opinion’s contention that the plaintiffs’ inability to perform\ntheir jobs is nothing more than the equivalent of a chill on commercial speech.  Lead Op. at 12-13.\nIn addition, the lead opinion’s commentary on the relative value of different forms of speech is not\na point raised by either of the parties or, to my mind, in any way relevant to the resolution of this\ncase.  For this reason, I find the lead opinion’sd iscussion ranking the value of political speech over\ncommercial speech puzzling.  I instead believe that Laird is distinguishable because the attorney-\nplaintiffs have in fact alleged a concrete, imminent, and particularized harm flowing from the TSP.\nOn appeal, the government contends that any litigation about the TSP must be premised on\nthe three general facts that the government has publicly disclosed:  (1) the TSP exists, (2) it operates\nwithout warrants, and (3) it intercepts “only communications that originate or conclude in a foreign\ncountry, and only if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a party to the communication is\naffiliated with al Qaeda.”  According to the government, the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they\nwere actually targets of the TSP and thus cannot  show more than a “subjective chill” on their\nactivities.  The governm ent asserts that the plaintiffs cannot establish standing because the\nstate-secrets privilege prevents us rfom testing the plaintiffs’ allegations that they have been or likely\nwill be subject to surveillance under the TSP.  Moreover, the government argues that the plaintiffs\nimproperly seek to assert the rights of thi rd parties, such as their overseas contacts, clients, and\nsources, who are not presently before the court.\nThe attorney-plaintiffs respond that they have suffered concrete, particularized injuries as\na result of the TSP.  Specifically, they contend that the TSP puts them in the position of abrogating\ntheir duties under applicable professional-responsibility rules if they communicate with clients and\ncontacts via telephone or email.  The TSP, in short, allegedly prevents them from doing their jobs.\nSpecifically, the attorney-plaintif fs contend that  they have had to travel internationally f or\nface-to-face meetings at a significant expense in terms of time and money.  They claim that their\nability to conduct research and factfinding has been limited, if not entirely thwarted, as a result.\nThe attorney-plaintiffs, as part of their re presentation of clients accused of being enem y\ncombatants or of providing aid to organizations dseignated as terrorist groups, declare that they have\nconducted internet research on terrorism, religion, politics, and human-rights issues in parts of the\nMiddle East and South Asia.  They further state  that they have reviewed web sites where topic s\nincluding jihad, kidnapping, and other terrorist acts are discussed.  As part of their work on behalf\nof their clients, these attorneys have communicated with potential witnesses, experts, lawyers, and\nother individuals who live and work outside the  United States about subjects such as terrorism ,\njihad, and al-Qaeda.  The attorney-plaintiffs cont end that because of the TSP, they have ceased\ntelephone or email communications about substantive issues with their overseas contacts.  This is\nbecause the TSP, unlike FISA, provides no m inimization procedures to protect attorney-client\ncommunications. \nUnder FISA, an application for an order authorizing surveillance must include a description\nof the minimization procedures that will be utilized to protect privileged communications.  50 U.S.C.\n§ 1804(a)(5).  “Minimization procedures” are “specific procedures . . . that are reasonably designed\n. . . to m inimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the di ssemination, of nonpublicly\navailable information concerning unconsenting United States persons.”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(h)(1)s;e e\nalso  50 U.S.C. §§1801(h)(2)-(4) (providing a further definition of t he term ).  Privileged\ncommunications remain such under FISA.  50 U.S.C. § 1806(a) (“No otherwise privileged\ncommunication obtained in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this subchapter\nshall lose its privileged character.”); id. § 1806(h).  \n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 44\nAs noted above, the lead opinion finds that  Laird controls this case.  Lead Op. at 16.\nAlthough the lead opinion then asserts that it lim its its application of Laird to only the attorney-\nplaintiffs’ First Amendment claim, its analysis suggests otherwise. L aird addressed the question of\n“whether the jurisdiction of a federal court properly may be invoked by a complainant who alleges\nthat the exercise of his First Amendment rights is being chilled by them ere existence, without more,\nof a governmental investigative and data-gathering activity that is alleged to be broader in scope\nthan is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of a valid governmental purpose.”  408 U.S.\nat 10 (emphasis added).  The case stands for thep roposition that “[a]llegations of a subjective ‘chill’\nare not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific\nfuture harm.”  Id. at 13-14.  In  Laird, the Court found that the U.S. Arm y, in its ca pacity as a\ndomestic peacekeeping body, had collected information on “public activities that were thought to\nhave at least some potential for civil disorder.”  Id. at 6.  “The information itself was collected by\na variety of means, but it is significant that the pirncipal sources of information were the news media\nand publications in general circulation.”  Id. \nI believe that the attorney-plaintif fs here allege a distinct set of  facts that is legally\ndistinguishable from those set forth inL  aird.  Unlike in the present case, theL aird plaintiffs simply\narticulated “speculative apprehensiveness that th e Army may at some future date misuse the\ninformation in some way that would cause direct harm to [them].”  408 U.S. at 13-14.  The Court\nstated that the plaintiffs “freely admit that they complain of no specific action of the Army against\nthem . . . .  There is no evidence of illegal or unlawful surveillance activities.”  Id. at 9.  \nIn contrast to  Laird, the attorney-plaintiffs here complain of specific present harms, not\nsimply of some generalized fear of the future  misuse of intercepted communications.  The TSP\nforces them to decide between breaching their dutyo f confidentiality to their clients and breaching\ntheir duty to provide zealous representation.  Neither position is tenable.  The attorney-plaintiffs\nmust travel to meet in person with clients and soucres in order to avoid the risk o fTSP surveillance.\nUnlike the situation in Laird, the attorney-plaintiffs in the present case allege that the government\nis listening in on private person-to-person communications that are not open to the public.  These\nare com munications that any rea sonable person would understand to be private.  The\nattorney-plaintiffs have thus identified concrete harms to themselves flowing from their reasonable\nfear that the TSP will intercept privileged communications between themselves and their clients.\nTo survive the government’s standing-to-sue challenge, the attorney-plaintiffs do not have\nto demonstrate that their past communications have in fact been intercepted by the TSP.  ILna idlaw,\nfor example, the Supreme Court found that environmental groups had standing to sue a polluter\nwhere their members declared “that they would use the nearby North Tyger River for recreation if\nLaidlaw were not discharging pollutants into it.”  528 U.S. at 184.  The Court did not require the\nplaintiffs to show that the pollutants had actually harmed the environment, instead finding that their\nmembers’ “reasonable concerns about the effects of [Laidlaw’s] discharges directly affected those\naffiants’ recreational, aesthetic, and econom ic interests,” and that these concerns “present[ed]\ndispositively more than the mere general averments and conclusory allegations found inadequate”\nin prior cases.  Id. at 183-84 (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nA similar conclusion was reached by the Fourth Circuit in  Friends of the Eart h, Inc. v.\nGaston Copper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149 (4th Cir. 2000).  InG  aston Copper, the court found\nthat the plaintiff had standing basedo n his assertion that he used the affected lake less than he would\nhave otherwise as a result of the ongoing pollu tion, despite the lack of evidence showing an\nobjective environmental change in the lake.  Id. at 156, 159.  \nBoth the Laidlaw and the Gaston Copper plaintiffs asserted more than “a mere academic or\nphilosophical interest,” Gaston Copper, 204 F.3d at 159, or “an ingenious academic exercise in the\nconceivable.”  United States v. Students ChallengingR egulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 45\nU.S. 669, 688 (1973).  The attorney-plaintiffs in thec ase before us likewise have alleged a harm far\nbeyond the academic in their challenge to the TSP.\nIn reaching the opposite conclusion, the l ead opinion attempts to distinguish Laidlaw by\nnoting that the plaintiffs there brought their complaint under the citizen-suit provision of the Clean\nWater Act, a fact that the lead opinion asserts “offers only minimal support” for the plaintiffs in the\npresent case.  Lead Op. at 34.  Although the plainti ffs in that case did indeed base their cause of\naction on an environmental statute, the Supreme Court still analyzed whether they satisf ied the\nconstitutional standing requirements of Article III.  See Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 180-89.  The fact that\nthe Clean Water Act contained a citizen-suit provision did not absolve the courts of examining the\nconstitutional standing of the particular plaintiffs before them.  I therefore find the lead opinion’s\ntreatment of  Laidlaw unpersuasive.  As in  Laidlaw, I have analyzed the att orney-plaintiffs’\nassertions of Article III standing and have concluded that they satisfy those requirements.\nThe concurring opinion also criticizes m y interpretation of  Laidlaw, describing it as\n“transform[ing] the holding” in that case.  C oncurring Op. at 37.  I do not belie ve that this\ncharacterization holds up under scrutiny.  In discussing the case, the concurring opinion describes\nthe Laidlaw plaintiffs as “in fact subject to defendan’ts conduct” of discharging pollutants in excess\nof permitted amounts into the North Tyger River.  Id.  (emphasis omitted).  The Supreme Court, to\nbe sure, noted that “it is undisputed that  Laidlaw’s unlawful conduct . . . was occurring,” but\nnonetheless found nothing “im probable about the proposition that a com pany’s continuous and\npervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby residents to curtail their\nrecreational use of that waterway and would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms.”\nLaidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \nThe concurring opinion then argues, in reference to the Laidlaw plaintiffs, that their “fear\nof harm from the defendant’s undisputed conduct—conduct that would also undisputably affect\nplaintiffs personally if they undertook their desired activities—was sufficient to support standing.”\nConcurring Op. at 37 (emphasis in original).  Similarly, the concurring opinion acknowledges that\n“the plaintiffs in the present case may have a reasonable fear of harm from the defendants’ conduct.”\nId.  It goes on to state, however, that the attorney-plaintiffs lack standing because they “m ust be\nactually subject to the defendant’s conduct, not simply afraid of being subject to it.”  Id.  Because\nI believe that the plaintiffs in the present case  are “actually subject to the defendant’s conduct”\nwithin the meaning of Laidlaw, I respectfully disagree with my colleague’s conclusion.\nTo my mind, the concurring opinion describes, rather than distinguishes, the situation of the\nattorney-plaintiffs.  The concurring opinion would hodl that the attorney-plaintiffs must demonstrate\nthat they have personally been subject to surveillnace under the TSP in order to have standing to sue.\nThis is akin to Laidlaw’s argument that the plaintiffs should have been required to demonstrate that\nLaidlaw’s mercury discharge violations caused them to “sustain[] or face[] the threat of any ‘injury\nin fact’ from Laidlaw’s activities.”  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 181.  But the Supreme Court rejected such\nan argument, stating that the plaintiffs need only show “the reasonableness of the fear that led the\naffiants to respond to that concededly ongoing conduct . . . .”  Id. at 184 (brackets and quotation\nmarks omitted). \nBoth the lead and concurring opinions proceedto  analogize the present case to two cases that\nI find distinguishable.  One is Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), where the Supreme Court\ndenied standing for injunc tive relief to a Los Angeles m otorist who had been subjected to a\nchokehold by the police duringa  routine traffic stop. I d. at 100.  The Court reasoned in part that the\nplaintiff’s “subjective apprehensions” that “a recurrence of the allegedly unlawful conduct” would\noccur were insufficient to support standing.  Id. at 107 n.8.  But the likelihood that Lyons would\nagain find himself in a chokehold by the Los Angeles police seems to me far more remote than the\nongoing concern of the attorney-plaintiffs here that their telephone or email communications will\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 46\nbe intercepted by the TSP.  Based upon the principles set forth in Laidlaw, the “reasonableness of\nthe fear” of the attorney-plaintiffs in the present case strikes me as being well beyond what is needed\nto establish standing to sue.  See Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184.\nPushing the lead opinion’s reasoning still f urther, the concurring opinion argues that the\nattorney-plaintiffs “can show nothing more than a fear” of “being subject to a government policy\nof surveillance.”  Concurring Op. at 37.  “By contrast, if the Laidlaw plaintiffs had resumed their\nabandoned activities, they would definitely have been subject to the defendant’s conduct—illegal\ndischarge into the river.”   Id.  The concurring opinion the n asserts that “[t]he Suprem e Court’s\ndistinction between Laidlaw and Lyons was one of kind, not degree.”  Id.  But I find no support for\nthis assertion, and my colleague’s reliance on a quotation from Laidlaw for this point strikes me as\nunpersuasive. \nIn fact, the Laidlaw plaintiffs were personally affected by the defendant’s conduct whether\nthey used the waterway or not.  Nothing inL aidlaw required that the plaintiffs demonstrate that they\nwere all equally likely to be affected by the pollutants, that the pollutants were evenly dispersed\nthrough the waterway, or that a plaintiff swimming in the river w as more likely than a plaintiff\ncanoeing on the river to be  injured.  All that was required was that they dem onstrate that, given\nLaidlaw’s undisputed conduct, they possessed a reasonable fear of harm.  This holds equally true\nfor the attorney-plaintiffs in the present case.   The existence of the TSP is undisputed and these\nplaintiffs are personally affected by the TSP whether they engage in targeted communications or not.\nIn sum, I believe that the distinction between Laidlaw and Lyons is in fact one of degree, and that\nthe attorney-plaintiffs here occupy a position far closer to the former than to the latter.\nThe other case to which the lead opinion analogizes the present suit is United Presbyterian\nChurch v. Reagan, 738 F.2d 1375 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  In  United Presbyterian Church, a group of\nreligious and political organizations, academics, journalists, and a member of Congress challenged\nthe constitutionality of a n Executive Order that “specif[ied] the organization, procedures and\nlimitations applicable to the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities of the Executive\nBranch.”  Id. at 1377.  TheU  nited Presbyterian Church plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that\nthis Executive Order violated the First, Fourt h, and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, the\nseparation-of-powers doctrine, and the National Security Act of 1947.   Id.  Unlike the\nattorney-plaintiffs in the present case, however, theU  nited Presbyterian Church plaintiffs “fail[ed]\nto allege that any plaintiff has suffered any injury in fact under the Or der.”  Id. (discussing the\ndistrict court opinion).  The D.C. Circuit therefor e affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the\ncomplaint for lack of standing to sue, but that fact-driven result has no bearing on the present case\nwith its dramatically different facts.  \nIn dismissing the complaint, the D.C. Circuit ofllowed Laird in concluding that the plaintiffs\nhad alleged no m ore than a subjective chill.   Id. at 1378-81.  The facts in the present case are\nsubstantially different, however, with even the concurring opinion acknowledging that “[h]ere the\nplaintiffs’ professional injuries are arguably a harm beyond chilled speech.”  Concurring Op. at 39\nn.3.  To be sure, several of the groups in  United Presbyterian Church claimed that they had\nexperienced direct injury, such as interception  of their m ail, disruption of their events, and\ninfiltration of their m eetings. United Presbyterian Chur ch, 738 F.3d at 1381 n.2.  But these\nallegations were deemed “too generalized” and insufficient because “[t]here is no allegation or even\nsuggestion that any unlawful action to which the appellants have been subjected in the past was the\nconsequence of the presidential action they seek to challenge here.”   Id. at 1380-81.  The D.C.\nCircuit thus concluded that, “[w]ithout such connection, standing to pursue the present suit does not\nexist.”  Id. at 1381.\nHere, in contrast, the attorney-plaintiffs have provided a connection between their injury and\nthe TSP.  Specifically, officials in the Bush Ad ministration have publicly stated that the TSP\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 47\ninvolves “intercepts” of “international calls” and “communications” where the government “ha[s]\na reasonable basis to conc lude that one party  to the communication is a m ember of al Qaeda,\naffiliated  with  al  Qaeda,  or   a  member  of  an  organization   affiliated  with  al  Qaeda,  or\nworking  in  support  of  al  Qaeda.”   Press  Bierfing  by  Alberto  Gonzales,  Att’y  Gen.,  and  Gen.\nMichael Hayd en, P rincipal D eputy D ir. f or N at’l Intelligence (Dec. 19, 2005),\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1.html.  These are exactly the\ntypes of clients that the attorney-plaintif fs represent.  The TSP theref ore constitutes a “genuine\nthreat” of harm to the attorney-plaintiffs, see Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 475 (1974), the\nabsence of which doomed the United Presbyterian Church plaintiffs’ action. \nA number of cases have distinguished Laird in situations such as this where the plaintiffs\nhave suffered professional injuries.  In Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465 (1987), for example, a state\nlegislator wished to publicly screen three Canadian-made films about the effects of acid rain and\nnuclear winter.  Under a f ederal statute, the films would have had to be designated as “political\npropaganda” in order to be shown in this country.  Keene sued for injunctive relief, contending that\nthe statute violated his First Amendment rights.  The Supreme Court held that Keene had standing\nto raise a First Amendment claim on the ground that identifying the films as “political propaganda”\nthreatened to cause him cognizable professional injury. I d. at 473.  Keene had not in fact shown the\nfilms, but alleged that he had standing based onh is anticipated harm.  The Court agreed, convinced\nthat voters would be less likely to support a candidate associated with propaganda.  Id. at 475.  \nAnother example is Ozonoff v. Berzak, 744 F.2d 224 (1st Cir. 1984),w  here the First Circuit\nfound standing for a physician who wished to work for the World Health Organization (WHO).  An\nExecutive Order required that a U.S. citizen undegro a loyalty check before the WHO could extend\nan offer of employment to that person, notwithstanding the fact that the WHO was not an entity of\nthe U.S. government.  The First Circuit distinguishedL aird because Ozonoff was alleging more than\n“the mere existence” of a governmental investigative and data-gathering activity.  Id. at 229-30.\nInstead, Ozonoff’s alleged injury was that the loyalty check would deter him from joining certain\norganizations or expressing certain views.  Because of the Executive Order, Ozonoff had chosen to\nlimit his organizational af filiations, m uch as the existence of  the TSP has caused the\nattorney-plaintiffs to limit their telephone and email communications.  Unlike Ozonoff, however,\nthe attorney-plaintiffs are stym ied in their ef forts to do their jobs by the need t o limit their\ncommunications.  I thus believe that the attorney-plaintiffs have alleged an even more concrete and\nparticularized injury than Ozonoff alleged.  \nA final example comes from the Third Circuit case of Paton v. LaPrade, 524 F.2d 862 (3d\nCir. 1975), where the court found standing for high-school student Lori Paton, who alleged that the\nexistence of an FBI investigative file about her oculd impair her future educational and professional\nopportunities.  Id. at 868.  As part of  a high school social studies class on “the contem porary\npolitical spectrum,” Paton had requested information from the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).  Id.\nat 865.  The FBI was monitoring mail received and sent by the SWP, resulting in Paton’s name and\naddress being recorded and placed in an FBI inve stigative file.  This “m ail cover” was in fact\ndirected at the SWP.  Like the TSP, the mail cover did not directly compel, proscribe, or regulate\nPaton.  But its effect, like that of the TSP, was to injure her.  Paton learned of the file after an FBI\nagent visited her high school to inquire about her.  On these facts, the Third Circuit found that she\nhad standing to challenge the postal regulation auhtorizing the recording of information about mail\ngoing to or from  an organi zation such as the SW P because “she m ay have sustained or be\nimmediately in danger of sustaining a direct in jury” to her present and fut ure educational or\nprofessional activities as a result.  Id. at 871-73. \nThe lead opinion attempts to distinguish these cases and others like them on the basis that\nthey challenged the “regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory” exercise of governmental power to\nwhich the complainants were presently or prospectively subject.  Lead Op. at 12 (quoting United\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 48\nPresbyterian Church, 738 F.2d at 1378).  But that type of government power is precisely what is\nbeing challenged here.  The attorney-plaintiffs have made credible allegations that the operation of\nthe TSP has compelled them to cease telephone and email communication about sensitive topics\nwith their clients and contacts.  Publicly admitted information about the TSP supports them.\nWhat I believe distinguishes  Meese, Ozonoff, Paton, and the like from  Laird is that the\nplaintiffs in the first-named cases successfully explained the “precise connection between the mere\nexistence of the challenged system and their alleged chill.”  Laird, 408 U.S. at 13, n.7.  Unlike the\nLaird plaintiffs who conceded that they them selves were not suf fering from any chill, the\nattorney-plaintiffs here have established a reasonable fear that has generated “actual,” “imminent,”\n“concrete,” and “particularized” harm resulting from the operation of the TSP, a program that lacks\nany minimization procedures to protect their privileged communications.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n560.\nFinally, the concurring opi nion would find that the state-secrets privilege prevents the\nattorney-plaintiffs from establishing an injury in fact.  Concurring Op. at 39 (“[T]he state secrets\nprivilege has prevented the plaintiffs from conducting discovery that might allow them to establish\nthat they are personally subject to the TSP, asI  believe constitutional standing requires.”).  But this\nreading expands the reach of the privilege in ways that the caselaw does not support.  Because the\nstate-secrets privilege “operates t o foreclose relief for violations of rights that m ay well have\noccurred by foreclosing the discovery of evidence th at they did occur, it is a privilege not to be\nlightly invoked.” H  alkin v. Helms, 690 F.2d 977, 990 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (citation and quotation amrks\nomitted); see also Ellsberg v. Mitchell, 709 F.2d 51, 57 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“[T]he privilege may not\nbe used to shield any m aterial not strictly necessary to prevent injury  to national security; and,\nwhenever possible, sensitive information must be disentangled from nonsensitive information to\nallow for the release of the latter.”).  \nThe privilege is typically invoked with respect to specific requests for discovery.  See, e.g.,\nJabara v. Kelley, 75 F.R.D. 475, 478-79 (E.D. Mich. 1977).  I,f however, the state-secrets privilege\n“deprives the [d]efendants of a valid defense to the [plaintiffs’] claims,” then summary judgment\nmay be granted to the defendant.  Tenenbaum v. Simonini, 372 F.3d 776, 777-78 (6th Cir. 2004).\nBut unlike inJ abara  or Tenenbaum, the attorney-plaintiffs here seek no additional discovrey\nfrom the defendants.  Instead, the attorney-plaintiffs argue that they have established standing based\non the facts in the public record.  This issue highlight s what I believe to be the key difference\nbetween the lead and concurring opinions on th e one hand and m y opinion on t he other.  My\ncolleagues believe that the attorney-plaintif fs must establish that they  were actually subject to\nsurveillance under the TSP, whereas I conclude that a demonstration of a reasonable, well-founded\nfear that has resulted in actual and particularized injury suffices.  My reading of the caselaw leads\nme to conclude that the state-secrets privilege is not so broad as to bar the attorney-plaintiffs from\nmaking such a showing.\nIn short, the critical question in this case isn ot whether the attorney-plaintiffs have actually\nbeen surveilled—because, as the lead opinion aptly notes, a wiretap by its nature is m eant to be\nunknown to its targets—but whether the “reasonabl eness of the fear”  of such surveillance is\nsufficient to establish that they have suffered actual, imminent, concrete, or particularized harm from\nthe government’s alleged unlawful action. S ee Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184.  For the reasons discussed\nabove, I believe that the plaintiffs have established  such an injury in fact.  I therefore turn to the\nremaining factors in the Article III constitutional-standing analysis.\n2. Causation\nThe plaintiffs must next demonstrate a causal connection between the injury asserted and the\ngovernment’s alleged conduct.  This means that “a federal court [can] act only to redress injury that\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 49\nfairly can be traced to the cha llenged action of the defendant, and  not . . . that results from  the\nindependent action of some third party not before the court.”  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org.,\n426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976).  The “fairly traceable” st andard, however, does not r equire that the\ndefendant’s conduct be the sole cause of the plaintiff’s injury.   See, e.g., Am. Canoe Ass’n, Inc. v.\nCity of Louisa Water & Sewer Comm’n, 389 F.3d 536, 543 (6th Cir. 2004) (finding the causation\nprong satisfied despite the absence of evidenc e  proving “to a scientific certainty” that the\ndefendant’s pollution caused the plaintiff’s injury). \nIn the present case, the lead opinion finds thatth e attorney-plaintiffs have failed to establish\ncausation due to its characterization of their “twoc ausal pathways based on the two types of alleged\ninjury.”  Lead Op. at 18.  These two pathways are then described as (1) the plaintiffs’ decision to\ncease certain communications as a result of the TSP, and (2) the decision by overseas contacts of\nthe plaintiffs to cease certain com munications as a result of the TSP.   Id.  The lead opinion\nconcludes that the plaintiffs “have no evidence . . . that the NSA has actually intercepted (or will\nactually intercept) any of  their conversations.”   Id.  Rather, the lead opinion characterizes the\nevidence in the record as establishing “only a possibility — not a probability or certainty — that\nthese calls might be intercepted, that the inofrmation might be disclosed or disseminated, or that this\nmight lead to some harm to the [plaintiffs’] overseas contacts.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  This\n“possibility” is too indeterminate, according to the lead opinion, and thus renders “the plaintiffs’\nshowing of causation less certain and the likelihood of causation more speculative.”  Id.  The lead\nopinion also concludes that the absence of a warrant for the alleged surveillance is insufficient to\nestablish causation because “it is not clear whether the chill can fairly be traced to the absence of\na warrant, or if the chill would still exist without regard to the presence or absence of a warrant.”\nLead Op. at 19. \nBased upon my reading of the complaint and the subsequent motion for partial summary\njudgment, I believe that the lead opinion has mischaracterized the attorney-plaintiffs’ allegations.\nWhat the attorney-plaintiffs themselves allege, in fact, is that the existence of the TSP outside of\nFISA’s minimization procedures has prevented  them from communicating by telephone and by\nemail with their clients, contacts, and sources, thus either compelling them to violate their ethical\nobligations, or requiring them to undertake costly overseas trips; in short, the TSP has prevented\nthem from doing their jobs.  In response, the lead opinion asserts that “there is no evidence in the\nrecord from which to presume that the NSA i s not complying with, or even exceeding, FISA’s\nrestrictions on the acquisition, retention, use, or dislcosure of [the information acquired] (i.e., FISA’s\nminimization techniques).”  Lead Op. at 20.  \nThis unsupported assertion is belied by statements on the public record from  Executive\nBranch officials.  With respect to the acquisition of inform ation, the TSP has been described as\nhaving   a   “softer   trigger”   than   FISA,   Prses   Briefing   by   Alberto   Gonzales,   Att’y   Gen.,\nand Gen. Michael Hayde n, Pr incipal Dep’y Dir. for Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005),\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1.html, and one that uses a\n“reasonable belief” standard rather than FISA’s  probable cause standard for surveillance.   See\nRemarks by Gen. Michael V. Hayden, Pirncipal Dep’y Dir. of Nat’l Intel., Address to the Nat’l Press\nClub, Jan. 23, 2006, http://www.dni.gov/speeches/20060123_speech.htm.  A senior official in the\nDepartment of Justice further inform ed Congress in 2006 that, “[a]lthough the [TSP] does not\nspecifically target the com munications of attorneys or physicians, calls invol ving such persons\nwould not  be  categorically  excluded  f rom  interception  . . . .”   Le tter  from  William  E.\nMoschella, Assistant Att’y Gen., to the Honorable F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (Mar. 24, 2006), at\n55, http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/doj032406.pdf.\nTo be sure, the Bush Administration has also asserted that “procedures are in place to protect\nU.S. privacy rights, including applicable  procedures required by Execut ive Order 12333 and\napproved by the Attorney General, that govern acquisition, retention, and dissem ination of\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 50\ninformation relating to U.S. persons.”  Id.  A review of this Executive Order, however, reveals that\nit makes no mention of protecting privileged communications.  See Exec. Order No. 12,333, 46 Fed.\nReg. 59, 941 (Dec. 4, 1981).  Furthermore, the Administration has claimed that “[b]ecause collecting\nforeign intelligence information without a warrant does not violate the Fourth Am endment and\nbecause   the   [TSP]   is   lawful,   there   appears   to   be   no   legal   barrier   against   introducing\nthis   evidence   in   a   criminal   prosecution.”    Letter   from  William   E.   Moschella,   Assistant\nAtt’y  Gen.,  t o  t he  Honorable   F.  Jam es  Sensenbrenner,  Jr.  (Mar.  24,  2006),  at  54,\nhttp://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/doj032406.pdf.  \nWhich characterization of injury one acceptsw  ill largely determine the causation prong (as\nwell as the redressability prong discussed below) of the standing analysis.  As one distinguished\ncommentator has noted, \n[t]he central problem in the causation cases is not whether there is a causal nexus\namong injury, remedy, and illegality; it is how to characterize the relevant injury.\nWhether the injury is due to the defendant’s conduct, or likely to be remedied by a\ndecree in his favor, depends on how the injury is described.\nCass R. Sunstein, Standing and the Privatization of Public Law,  88 Colum. L. Rev. 1432, 1464\n(1988).  \nThe lead opinion focuses prim arily on the lack of evidence that “the NSA has actually\nintercepted (or will actually intercept) any of [the plaintiffs’] conversations,” and on the “the\nabsence of a warrant (and all that goes with it).”  Lead Op. at 18 (footnote and emphasis omitted).\nBut as I discussed earlier in Part I.A.1., the attorney-plaintiffs need show only the reasonableness\nof their fear, not that their fear has in fact been realized. S ee, e.g., Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 184;M  eese,\n481 U.S. at  475.  I thus find the attorney-plain tiffs’ characterization of their injury the m ore\npersuasive.\nSince learning of the existence and operation ofth e TSP, the attorney-plaintiffs contend that\nthey have ceased communicating by telephone or email about sensitive subjects with their clients\nand contacts.  W hether the potential surveillance is conducted pursuant to a warrant is not the\ngravamen of their complaint.  Their concern is directed at the impact of the TSP on their ability to\nperform their jobs.  The causation requirement does not demand that the government’s conduct be\nthe “sole cause” of the attorney-plaintiffs’ injury, only that the injury be “fairly traceable” to that\nconduct.  See Simon, 426 U.S. at 41; Am. Canoe Ass’n, 389 F.3d at 543.  If the TSP did not exist,\nthe attorney-plaintiffs would be protected by FISA’s minimization procedures and would have no\nreason to cease telephone or email communication with their international clients and contacts.  I\ntherefore conclude that the attorney-plaintiffs have demonstrated a causal connection between their\nasserted injury and the government’s alleged actions.  \n3. Redressability\nThis leaves the issue of  whether the attorn ey-plaintiffs’ injury “will be redressed by a\nfavorable decision.”  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 181.  The lead opinion’s redressability analysis appears\nto make two basic points.  First, the lead opinion cites 50 U.S.C. § 1806(a) for the proposition that\n“the issuance of FISA warrants would not relieve any of the plaintiffs’ fears of being overheard; it\nwould relieve them only of the fear that the infor mation might be disseminated or used against\nthem.”  Lead Op. at 21.  The lead opinion also asserts that \nFISA might not prohibit the interception of attorney-client communications under\ncircumstances where the NSA adheres to ap olicy of complete non-disclosure.  Due\nto the State Secrets Doctrine, the plaintiffs do not (and cannot) know whether the\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 51\nNSA actually adheres to a policy of complete non-disclosure, but based on the record\nevidence, it certainly remains possible.  \nLead Op. at 21 n.31.  That proposition, however, isi tself speculation, as the lead opinion concedes.\nAbsent a public revelation from the NSA, the attorney-plaintiffs (or anyone else, for that matter) will\nsimply never know whether a nondisclosure policy in fact exists.  \nIn the face of this uncertainty, the attorney-plaintiffs must presume the absence of such a\npolicy.  Their ethical obligations require them  to do so, lest they run the risk of reveal ing\nconfidential and possibly incriminating information directly to the government.  The reasonable\nconcern about the possibility of disclosure—not the disclosure itself—triggers those obligations.\nSimilarly, the simple assertion that\n[t]he TSP is designed and operated for the prevention of terrorism, and the NSA is\ninterested only in telephone and email communications in which one party to the\ncommunication is located outside the United States and the NSA has a ‘reasonable\nbasis to conclude that one party to the com munication is a member of[, affiliated\nwith,] or working in support of al Qaeda,’\nLead Op. at 21, doe s not mean that the TSP is not and could not be used to facilitate crim inal\ninvestigation.  Cf. In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 727 (For. Intel. Surv. Ct. Rev. 2002) (stating that\nFISA does not “precl ude or limit the government’s use or proposed use of foreign intelligence\ninformation . . . in a criminal prosecution.”).  \nThe lead opinion contends that there is a lack of “evidence in the present record to suggest[]\nthat the information collected by the NSA under  the TSP has been disclosed to anyone f or any\npurpose.”  Lead Op. at 21 n.31.B  ut see Al-Haramain Islamic Found. v. Bush, 451 F. Supp. 2d 1215,\n1223-25, 1228-30 (D. Or. 2006) (discussing the effect of the government’s inadvertent disclosure\nof a sealed docum ent that arguably described  surveillance of the plaintiffs under the  TSP).\nNotwithstanding the lead opinion’s contention, a pl ain reading of the FISA statute provides no\nsupport for the speculative assertion that a “policy of complete non-disclosure” exists within the\nNSA.  FISA’s explicit provisions regarding minimization procedures and privileged communications\nin fact strongly support the opposite conclusion. \nThe lead opinion’s second point is premised on 50 U.S.C. § 1805(f), which sets forth the\nemergency-based exceptions to the norm al FISA procedures.  It cites this subsection for  the\nproposition that “FISA’s general requirement that electronic surveillance may proceed only upon\nissuance of a FISA Court warrant is not absolute, as FISA provides for instances in which a prior\nwarrant may be unnecessary, at least for a short period of time.”  Lead Op. at 21 n.31.  I agree that\nFISA’s warrant requirement is “not absolute.”  But the “warrant requirement” is besides the point.\nInstead, FISA’s minimization procedures regarding the use of wiretapped information are the only\nFISA protections that ultimately bear on the redressability prong of the standing analysis in the\npresent case.  The point is that these m inimization procedures are “absolute” even though the\nwarrant requirement is not.   See 50 U.S.C. § 1805(f) (“If the Attorney General authorizes such\nemergency employment of electronics urveillance, he shall require that the minimization procedures\nrequired by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed.”) (emphasis added). \nAdmittedly, the Supreme Court has f urnished little guidance regarding the scope of  the\nredressability inquiry beyond requiring a “‘direct’ relationship between the alleged injury and the\nclaim sought to be adjudicated.” L  inda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 618 (1973).  But I believe\nthat the present case clearly demonstrates such a direct link between the attorney-plaintiffs’ injury\nand their claim.  The attorney-plaintiffs’ redressability arguments revolve around their very real\nongoing ethical obligations to their clients, to ther iprofession, and to themselves.  These obligations,\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 52\nas noted above, exist independently of whether the attorney-plaintiffs’ communications with their\nclients have actually been wiretapped through theT SP, independently of whether the NSA actually\nadheres to a “policy of com plete non-disclosure” for all TSP-wireta pped inform ation, and\nindependently of whether a judicially authorized warrant has actually been procured in advance of\nthe alleged wiretapping.  This is where the Supreme Court’s 2000 decision in Laidlaw again comes\ndirectly into play.\nThe Court in Laidlaw found that the plaintiffs had satisfied the redressability prong even\nthough the defendant, during the course of the appeal, had voluntarily ceased the conduct that had\ninitially given rise to the lawsuit.  528 U.S. at 188-89.  Here , too, the NSA has allegedly ceased\nconducting the TSP independently of the FISA court,  as discussed in greater depth i n Part I.D.\nbelow.  But as the government’s counsel conceded at oral argument, the Executive Branch views\nitself as free to unilaterally “opt out” of the FISA court’s oversight at any time.  The civil penalties\nimposed on the defendant in Laidlaw, the Supreme Court held, redressed the plaintiffs’ alleged\ninjuries from the prior unauthorized pollutant discharges because those injuries were ongoing and\nthe penalties would generally deter  not only that particular def endant, but also others sim ilarly\nsituated to it, from engaging in similar conduct in the future.  See id. at 187. \nDeterrence, in short, is an especially appropriate consideration where, as here, the alleged\nharm is not “wholly past” but, as publicly acknowledged by the government, instead “ongoing at\nthe time of the complaint and . . . could continue into the f uture.”   Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 188\n(distinguishing the holding inS teel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’,t 523 U.S. 83, 108 (1998)).  The\nCourt’s holding in Laidlaw could not be m ore applicable than it is to the present case:  “It can\nscarcely be doubted that, for a plaintiff who is injured or faces the threat of future injury due to\nillegal conduct ongoing at the tim e of suit, a sanction that effectively abates that conduct and\nprevents its recurrence provides a form of redress.”  Id. at 185-86.   \nThe facts alleged by the attorney-plaintiffs here  fit this language to a “T.”  Each of them\n“faces the threat” that the TSP will harm them in the future, the TSP was undisputedly ongoing at\nthe time that the attorney-plaintiffs filed their lawsuit, and the district court’s injunction “effectively\nabates” the TSP and “prevents its recurrence.”  Thel ead opinion’s parting assertion that “[t]he only\nway to redress the injury would be to enjoin all wiretaps, even those for which warrants are issued\nand for which full prior notice is given to the  parties being tapped,” Lead Op. at 22, provides\nrhetorical flourish but significantly overstates thea ttorney-plaintiffs’ allegations.  Simply requiring\nthat the Executive Branch conform its surveillance-gathering activities to governing law, including\nthe requirements of FISA, will redress the attorney-plaintif fs’ injury.  More is not needed.  I\ntherefore conclude that the attorney-plaintiffs have satisfied the redressability prong of the standing\nanalysis.\n4. Prudential requirements\nThe attorney-plaintiffs must satisfy the requirements of prudential standing in addition to\nsatisfying the Article III constitutional requirements.  Specifically, they must demonstrate that they\nare asserting their own interests rather than those of a third partys,e e Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,\n751 (1984), and that they are asserting a personalized claim rather than a generalized grievance.S  ee\nFed. Election Comm’n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 23-25 (1998).  Othepr rudential-standing requirements\nexist t hat a re not universally  applied in all cases.  One such requirem ent is the so-called\nzone-of-interests test. See Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 400 n.16 (1987) (noting that\nthe zone-of-interests test “is most usefully understood as a gloss on the meaning of § 702” of the\nAdministrative Procedures Act).  This test requiresp laintiffs to show that they are “within the zone\nof interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision or constitutional guarantee invoked in\nthe suit.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997).\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 53\na. Generalized grievance and personal interest\nPrudential-standing requirements preclude litigation in efderal court “when the asserted harm\nis a ‘generalized grievance’ shared in substantially equal measure by all of al arge class of citizens,”\nor where a plaintiff seeks to “rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975).  The fact that ah arm is widely shared, however, will not\nby itself preclude standing if the harm is also concrete and particularized.M   ass. v. Envtl. Protection\nAgency, 127 S. Ct. 1438, 1456 (2007) (“[W]here a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court\nhas found ‘injury in fact.’”) (quoting Fed. Election Comm’n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 24 (1998))).  \nIn the present case, the attorney-plaintif fs have alleged specif ic and concrete injuries to\nthemselves and to their ability to engage in their proefssional work due to the operation of the TSP.\nThey allege that they are unable to engage int elephone and email communications with clients and\ncontacts because the identity of those clients and contacts, some of whom have been charged with\nlinks to terrorism  or terrorist organizations, fa ll within the am bit of  the TSP.  Because the\ngovernment has admitted that the TSP has opera ted outside of FISA and does not distinguish\nattorneys from any other person whose  telephone or em ail communications might be under\nelectronic surveillance, the attorney-plaintif fs have been unable, consistent with their ethical\nresponsibilities to their clients and to the bar, to engage in privileged communications.  They must\ninstead incur the significant financial and professional burden of traveling to meet in person with\nclients and contacts.\nThe TSP has thus injured the attorney-plaintiffs both personally and professionally.  For\nthese reasons and for the reasons previously discussedi n my analysis of injury in fact in Part I.B.1.\nabove, I conclude that the attorney-plaintiffs araes serting personalized, individual harms rather than\ngeneralized grievances or the rights of a third party.\n   b. Zone of interests\nThe zone-of-interests t est i s the other prudential standing requirem ent that the\nattorney-plaintiffs must satisfy.  They must show that they are arguably within the zone of interests\nof “a relevant statute.”  5 U.S.C. § 702; Clarke, 479 U.S. at 396.  The Supreme Court has clarified\n“that the breadth of the zone of interests varies according to the provisions of law at issue, so that\nwhat comes within the zone of i nterests of a statute for purposes of obtaining judicial review of\nadministrative action under the generous review  provisions of the APA may not do so for other\npurposes.” Id. at 163 (quotation marks omitted). \nIn the present case, the attorney-plaintiffs don ot raise a cause of action under FISA or under\nTitle III; instead, their cause of action arises under the APA.  Under § 702 of the APA, “[a] person\nsuffering legal wrong because of agency action, or daversely affected or aggrieved by agency action\nwithin the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  A\nplaintiff must therefore “identify some agency action that affects him in the specified fashion.”\nLujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 882 (1990) (quotation marks omitted).  Second, the\nplaintiff must show that he has suffered a “legal wrong” because of that agency action or that he is\n“adversely affected or aggrieved by that action within the meaning of a relevant statute.” I d. at 883\n(quotation marks omitted).  \nThe Supreme Court said in Lujan “that to be adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the\nmeaning of a statute, the plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of . . . falls within the\nzone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal\nbasis for his complaint.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  “In determining whether the petitioners\nhave standing under the zone-of-interests test to bring their APA claims, we look not to the terms\nof the [relevant statute’s] citizen-suit provision, butto  the substantive provisions of the [statute], the\nalleged violations of which serve as the gravamen of the complaint.”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 175.  The\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 54\nattorney-plaintiffs here maintain that the T SP violates FISA and Ti tle III by functioning as an\nelectronic surveillance program outside the “exclusive means” of those statutes. \nFISA includes a civil-liability provision, which states that\n[a]n aggrieved person, other than a foreignp ower or an agent of a foreign power, as\ndefined in section 1801(a) or (b)(1)(A) of this title, respectively, who has been\nsubjected to an electronic surveillance or about w hom information obtained by\nelectronic surveillance of such person has  been disclosed or us ed in violation of\nsection 1809 of this title shall have a cause of action against  any person who\ncommitted such violation and shall be entitled to recover [actual and punitive\ndamages and reasonable attorney fees and costs].\n50 U.S.C. § 1810.  The lead opinion asserts that the attorney-plaintiffs c annot establish that they\nhave a right to sue because they are not “aggrieved persons” under FISA.  An “aggrieved person”\nis defined as “a person who is the target of an electronic surveillance or any other person whose\ncommunications or activities were subject to el ectronic surveillance.”  50 U.S.C. § 1801(k).\nAccording to the lead opinion, because the plaintiffs “have not shown that they were actually the\ntarget of, or subject to, the NSA’s surveillance,”th ey cannot establish a cause of action under FISA.\nLead Op. at 32.   \nThe attorney-plaintiffs’ challenge, however, is precisely that the TSP has operated outside\nof FISA despite the  fact that Congress has decl ared FISA to be the “exclusive m eans” for the\ngovernment to engage in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes in this country.\n18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).  They rely on provisions of FISA and of Title III of the Om nibus Crime\nControl and Safe Streets Act, which criminalizes the interception and/or disclosure of wire, oral, or\nelectronic communications other than pursuant to those statutes.S  ee 50 U.S.C. § 1809(a); 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2511(2)(f).  \nThe lead opinion contends that Title III canno stupport standing because the statute provides\nthat “[n]othing contained in this chapter or ch apter 121 or 206 of this title, or section 705 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, shall be deem ed to affe ct the acquisition by the United States\nGovernment of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications.”\n18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).  Lead Op. at 29.  But this erading of the statute ignores the remainder of the\nsentence.  In full, section (2)(f) states as follows:\nNothing contained in this chapter or chapter 121 or 206 of this title, or section 705\nof the Communications Act of 1934, shall bed eemed to affect the acquisition by the\nUnited States Government of foreign intelligence information from international or\nforeign communications, or foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance\nwith otherwise applicable Federal law invovling a foreign electronic communications\nsystem, utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance as deifned in section 101\nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978,a nd procedures in this chapter\nor chapter 121 and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall be the\nexclusive means by which electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of such\nAct, and the interception of domestic wir,e oral, and electronic communications may\nbe conducted.\n(Emphasis added.)  In light of the fact that Title III deals only with dom estic wiretaps to obtain\nintelligence inf ormation relating to  certain specif ied offenses,  see 18 U.S.C. § 2516, the\nabove-quoted subsection makes quite clear that FISA “shall be the  exclusive means by which\nelectronic surveillance [for foreign intelligence purposes] . . . may be conducted.”  Id.  (emphasis\nadded). \n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 55\nThe lead opinion contends, however, that the “exclusive means” provision of Title III and\nFISA should be read “as two separate and independent, albeit parallel, statements.”  Lead Op. at 32.\nAccordingly, the lead opinion asserts, “[t]his provision does not foreclose the possibility that the\ngovernment may engage in certain surveillance activities that are outside of the strictures of both\nTitle III and FISA.”   Id.  But the lead opinion provides no le gal support for this novel statutory\ninterpretation and none is apparent to me.  This, in my opinion, flies directly in the face of the plain\nlanguage of FISA and its legislative history.  I note, moreover, that the government announced in\nJanuary of this year that the TSP would hencefotrh be conducted under the aegis of the FISA Court\nof Review.\nThe language of both the FISA statute and its l egislative history is explicit:  FISA was\nspecifically drafted “to curb the practice by which the Executive [B]ranch may conduct warrantless\nelectronic surveillance on its own unilateral determination that national security justiifes it.”  S. Rep.\nNo. 95-604, pt. I, at 8,  reprinted at 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3904, 3910; see also id. at 3908.  When\ndebating FISA, Congress made clear that it intended to prevent the Executive Branch from engaging\nin electronic surveillance in the United States without judicial oversight, even during times of war.\nSee S. Rep. No. 95-701, at 47,r eprinted at 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3973, 4016 (“This bill will establish\nthe exclusive United States law governing electronic surveillance in the United States for foreign\nintelligence purposes.”).  \nCongress explicitly refuted the “inherent authority” argument on which the government seeks\nto justify the TSP’s existence:\nFinally, S. 1566 spells out taht the Executive cannot engage in electronic surveillance\nwithin the United States without a prior judicial warrant. This is accomplished by\nrepealing the so-called executive “inherent power” disclaimer clause currently found\nin section 2511 (3) of Title 18, United States Code.  S. 1566 provides instead that its\nstatutory procedures (and those found in chapter 119 of title 18) “shall be the\nexclusive means” for conducting electronic surveillance, as defined in the legislation,\nin the United States. The highly controversial disclaim er has often be en cited as\nevidence of a congressional ratificati on of the President’s inherent constitutional\npower to engage in electronic surveillan ce in order to obtain f oreign intelligence\ninformation essential to the national security.  Despite the adomnition of the Supreme\nCourt that the language of the disclaimer was “neutral” and did not reflect any such\ncongressional recognition of inherent power, the section has been a major source of\ncontroversy. By repealing section 2511(3) and expressly stating that the stat utory\nwarrant procedures spelled out in the law must be followed in conducting electronic\nsurveillance in the United States, this legislation ends the eight-year debate over the\nmeaning and scope of the inherent power disclaimer clause.\nS. Rep. No. 95-604, pt. I, at 6-7,  reprinted at 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3904, 3908.  In fact, Congres s\nrejected language that would have made FISA and Title III the “exclusive statutory means” under\nwhich electronic surveillance could be conducte d, instead adopting language that m ade those\nstatutes simply the “exclusive means” governing such surveillance.  See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-\n1720, at 35, reprinted at 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4048, 4064 (emphasis added).\nMore  to  the  point,  the  government  has  publicly  admitted  that  the  TSP  has  operated\noutside of  the  FISA  and  Title  III  statutor y  framework,  and  that  the  TSP  engages  in\n“electronic surveillance.”    Press   Briefing   by    Alberto   Gonzales,   Att’y   Gen.,   and   Gen.\nMichael  Hayden,  Principal  Deputy Dir.   for  Nat’l  Intellige nce  ( Dec.  19,  2005),\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1.html (General Hayden: “I can\nsay unequivocally that we have used this program in lieu of [the FISA processes] and this program\nhas been successful.”).  In January of 2007, in fact, the Bush Administration announced that it had\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 56\nreached a secret agreement with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) whereby the\nTSP would com ply with FISA, a further acknow ledgment that the TSP had pr eviously been\noperating without FISA approval.  See Letter from Alberto Gonzales, Att’y Gen., to the Honorable\nPatrick Leahy  &  the  Honorable  Arlen  Specter   (Jan.  17,  2007),  at   1  (“[A]ny  electronic\nsurveillance that  was  occurring  as  part  of  the  Terrorist  Surveillance  Program  will  now  be\nconducted subject to the approval of the Fo reign Intelligence  Surveillance Court.”),\nhttp://leahy.senate.gov/press/200701/1-17-07%20AG%20to%20PJL%20Re%20FISA%20Court.pdf;\nsee also Dan Eggen, Spy Court’s Orders Stir Debate on Hill, Wash. Post, Jan. 19, 2007, at A06\n(reporting on the reaction to the B ush administration’s announcement “that it will dismantle the\ncontroversial counterterrorism surveillance program  run by the National Security Agency and\ninstead conduct the eavesdropping under the authority o fthe secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt, which issues warrants in spy and terrorism cases”).\nThe lead opinion, however, repeats the government’s assertion that none of the plaintiffs\nhave shown “that the NSA’s surveillance activities include the sort of conduct that would satisfy\nFISA’s definition of ‘electronic surveillance,’” and declares that “the present record does not\ndemonstrate that the NSA’s conduct falls within FISA’s definitions.”  Lead Op. at 31.  As an initial\nmatter, this argument has been waived because the government failed to raise it before the district\ncourt.  See, e.g., United States v. Abdi, 463 F.3d 547, 563 (6th Cir. 2006) (“It is fundamental, and\nfirmly established by Supreme Court precedent, that appellate courts generally are not to consider\nan issue brought for the first time on appeal.”).  \nMoreover, the government’s contention lacks merit.  The Attorney General has publicly\nacknowledged that FISA “requires a court order befor e e ngaging in  this kind of\nsurveillance . . . unless otherwise authorized by Congress.”  Press Briefing by Alberto Gonzales,\nAtt’y Gen., and Gen. Michael Hayden, Principal  Dep’y Dir. f or Nat’l Intel. (Dec. 19, 2005),\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1.html.  (Em phasis added.)\nOther Administration officials have similarly characterized the TSP as being used “in lieu of” FISA.\nId.  These statements indicate that the TSP in fact captures electronic surveillance as defined by\nFISA, despite the belated effort of Executive Branch officials to disavow this acknowledgment.  \nThere is no doubt in my mind that the attorney-plaintiffs have established that the injury\ncomplained of falls  wi thin t he zone of inte rests sought to be protected by these statutes.\nAccordingly, I conclude that they have satisfied the prudential-standing requirements.\n5. Standing summary\nFor all of the reasons discussed above, I believe that the attorney-plaintiffs have satisfied\nboth the constitutional and prudential requirements for standing to sue.  I thereofre conclude that the\nattorney-plaintiffs are entitled to proceed with their claims against the government for the injuries\nallegedly flowing from the operation of the TSP.  \nC. Mootness\nThe last procedural hurdle that the plaintiffs m ust overcome is the question of mootness.\nArticle III of the Constitution lim its the jurisdiction of the federal courts to “actual, ongoing\ncontroversies.” Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 317 (1988).  Federal coutrs have “neither the power to\nrender advisory opinions nor to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case\nbefore them.”   Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975) (quotatoin marks omitted).  Mootness\nbecame an issue in this case in January of 2007, when the government publicly announced that a\njudge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had issued orders authorizing the government\nto conduct electronic surveillance of “internationalc ommunications into or out of the United States\nwhere there is probable cause to believe” that one party to the communication is “a member or agent\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 57\nof al Qaeda or an associated te rrorist organization.”  Letter from Alberto Gonzales, Att’y Gen.,\npreviously cited on p. 56, at 1. \nAs a result of these orders, electronic surveillance that had been occurring under the TSP\n“will now be conducted subject to the approval” ofth e FISC, and “the President has determined not\nto reauthorize” the TSP.   Id. at 1-2.  The governm ent, in short, decided t o voluntarily cease\nelectronic surveillance of international communications in this country outside of FISA.  On the\nground that such surveillance would henceforth be FISA-compliant, the government argues that we\nshould dismiss this case as moot and vacate the judgment below.  To be sure, if we could be satisfied\nthat the TSP would never be reinstituted, then the government’s argument would have merit.  We\nmust therefore determine whether the present situation fits into the voluntary-cessation exception\nto the mootness doctrine.\nUnder well-established Supreme Court precedent, the “voluntary cessation of allegedly\nillegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case, i.e., does not\nmake the case moot,” United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953), because “courts\nwould be compelled to leave the defendant . . . free to r eturn to his old ways.”   United States v.\nConcentrated Phosphate Export Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968) (quotation marks omitted).  The\ntest is demanding:  “A case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that\nthe allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasona bly be  expected to recur,”  Concentrated\nPhosphate, 393 U.S. at 203, and if “interim  relief or events have com pletely and irrevocably\neradicated the effects of the alleged violation.”  Los Angeles County v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631\n(1979).  Moreover, the “heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct cannot\nreasonably be expected to start up againl ies with the party asserting mootness.”  Laidlaw, 528 U.S.\nat 189 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The government urges us to find that there is “no\nlonger any live genuine controversy to adjudicate” because the TSP ceased to exist when the\nPresident’s last authorization for it expired, thus resolving and mooting the plaintiffs’ claims. \nBut the government continues to assert that the TSP did not violate the Constitution or any\nfederal statute prior to the January 2007 FISC orders.  Instead, it contends that “[a]n independent\njudicial body—the FISA court—has now acted to  provide additional and wholly sufficient legal\nauthority for the activity in question.”  The government accordingly argues that it “has in no sense\nterminated its conduct in response to plaintiffs’ sui”t, but rather that the FISC orders “provide[] legal\nauthority that plaintiffs claimed was absent.”  Both in its briefsa nd at oral argument, the government\ninsisted that the FISC orders represent an independent “intervening act of a coordinate branch of\ngovernment” that suffices to render the voluntary-cessation exception inapplicable. \nBut the government acknowledged at oral argument that the President maintains that he has\nthe authority to “opt out” of the FISA framework at any time and to reauthorize the TSP or a similar\nprogram.  The government also conceded that theF ISC orders were actively sought by the Executive\nBranch, and that the President decided that he would comply with the orders only “after determining\nthat the [FISC] order[s] provide[d] the necessary speed and agility” ofr TSP-style surveillance.  Most\nrecently, the Director of National Intelligence stated duri ng a congressional hearing that the\ngovernment continued to believe that t he President has the authority under Article II of the\nConstitution to order the N SA to conduct w arrantless electronic surveillance.  Jam es Risen,\nAdministration Pulls Back on Surveillance Agreement, N.Y. Times, May 2, 2007, at A18.  These\nfacts do not support a conclusion that it is “absolut ely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior\ncould not reasonably be expected to recur.” C  oncentrated Phosphate, 393 U.S. at 203.  Indeed, the\ngovernment’s insistence that the TSP was perfectly lawful and the reservation of its ability to opt\nout of the FISC orders at any time lend credence to the opposite position.  \n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 58\nI therefore conclude that the government has failed to meet its heavy burden of showing that\nthe challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again.  Accordingly, I conclude\nthat this case is not moot and that this court may properly continue to exercise jurisdiction over it.\nD. Merits\nWithout expressing an opinion concerning the analysis of the district court, I would affirm\nits judgment because I conclude that the TSP violaets FISA and Title III and that the President does\nnot have the inherent authority to act in disregadr of those statutes.  The clearest ground for deciding\nthe merits of this appeal is the plaintiffs’ statutory claim, just as the clearest argument for standing\nis presented by the attorney-plaintiffs.   This is not to say that the plaintiffs’ other causes of action\nlack merit, but simply that this case can, andt herefore should, be decided on the narrowest grounds\npossible.  See, e.g., City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 457 (1985) (“When a\nlower court correctly decides a case, albeit on what this Court concludes are unnecessary\nconstitutional grounds, our usual custom i s . .  . to affirm on the narrower, dispositive ground\navailable.”) (quotation marks omitted).\n1. The TSP violated FISA and Title III\nThe government contends that “it would be imprudent . . . to address plaintiffs’ FISA claim\nwithout a district court decision addressing the preidcate questions necessary to the resolution of that\nclaim in the first instance.”  This argument overlooks the fact that an appellate court possessed of\nproper jurisdiction can affirm on any ground fairly supported by the record.  See In re Cleveland\nTankers, Inc., 67 F.3d 1200, 1205 (6th Cir. 1995).  Moreover, as the following analysis indicates,\nno predicate findings from the district court are needed to resolve the plaintiffs’ statutory argument.\nBoth FISA and Title III expressly prohibit electronic surveillance outside of their statutory\nframeworks, as set forth in Part I.B.4.b. above.  The language used is unequivocal.  In ena cting\nFISA, Congress directed that electronic surveillance conducted inside the United States for foreign\nintelligence purposes was to be undertaken only as athuorized by specific federal statutory authority.\nSee 50 U.S.C. § 1809.  Title III crim inalizes the interception and disclosure of  wire, oral, and\nelectronic communications except under certain specified exceptions.  See 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).\nThe statute clearly states that chapter 119 and FISA “s hall be the  exclusive means by which\nelectronic surveillance  .  .  .  a nd th e in terception o f d omestic w ire, o ral, a nd e lectronic\ncommunications may be conducted.”  Id. (emphasis added). \nIn construing statutory language, we assume that “Congress said what it meant.”  United\nStates v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 757 (1997).  W here the text of a statute is clear, “we need not\nassess the legislative history of the . . . provision.”C  ircuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105,\n119 (2001).  I nonetheless reiterate that the l egislative history of FISA clearly reinforces the\nconclusion that FISA and Title III constitute the sole means by which electronic surveillance may\nlawfully be conducted.  During a conference sessoin on the FISA legislation, members of Congress\nrejected language that would have described FISA and Title III as the “exclusive statutory means”\nby which electronic surveillance was perm itted, preferring instead the broader construction,\n“exclusive means.”  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1720, at 35 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n4048, 4064.\nCongress has thus unequivocally declared that FISA and Title III are the exclusive means\nby which electronic surveillance is perm itted.  No other authorization can com ply with the law.\nCongress further emphasized this point by criminalizing the undertaking of electronic surveillance\nnot authorized by statute in two separate places in the U.S. Code. S ee 50 U.S.C. § 1809; 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2511(1) & (2)(e).  The government, however, contends that Congress authorized the TSP in the\naftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks by enactnig the Authorization for Use of Military Force\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 59\n(AUMF), Pub. L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (Sept. 18, 2001).  In addition, the governemnt notes that\n“foreign intelligence gathering is . . . vital to the successful prosecution of war.”\nBut FISA itself expressly and specifically restricts the President’s authority even in times\nof war.  The statute provides that “[n]otwithst anding any other law, the Pr esident, through the\nAttorney General, may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order under this subchapter\nto acquire foreign intelligence information for a period not to exceed fifteen calendar days following\na declaration of war by the Congress.”  50 U.S.C. § 1811.  FISA thus limits warrantless electronic\nsurveillance to the first 15 days following a declaration of war, a more formal action than even the\nenactment of an authorization for the use of force.  This 15-day period of warrantless surveillance\nwas enacted to permit “consideration of any amendment to this Act that may be appropriate during\na wartime emergency.”  H.R. Conf. Rep. 95-1720, at 34,  reprinted at 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4048,\n4063.  \nTo be sure, Congress in 1978 likeyl did not contemplate a situation such as the one that arose\nwith the attacks of September 11, 2001.  But in thea ftermath of those attacks, Congress has shown\nitself both willing and abl e to consider appropriate amendments to FISA.  Congress has in fact\namended FISA multiple times since September 11, 2001, increasing the President’s authority by\npermitting “roving” wiretaps and expanding the permissible use of pen-register devices.   S ee USA\nPATRIOT Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-56 §§ 206, 214,  as amended by Pub. L. No. 109-177,\n§§ 108, 128 (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. § 1805 and 18 U.S.C. § 1842).  \nBut  Congress  has  never  suspended  FISA’s  application  nor  altered  the  15-day  limit\non  warrantless  electronic  surveillance.   Id.   The  Attorney  General  has  in  fact  acknowledged\nthat  the  Bush  Administration  has  never  sought  an  am endment  to  FISA  that  m ight  have\nprovided   authorization   for   the   TSP   or   a   similar   program   because   certain   members   of\nCongress   allegedly   informed   the   Administration   that   such   an   amendment   would    be\n“difficult,  if  not  impossible”  to  obtain.   Press  Briefing  by  Alberto  Gonzales,  Att’y  Gen.,\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051219-1.html.\nYet the TSP is precisely the type of program that FISA was enacted to oversee.  A senior\nDepartment of Justice official has conceded  that the TSP involved warrantless electronic\nsurveillance of communications into and out of the United States.

Rockefeller,  IV,\nthe Honorable Peter Hoekstra, & the Honorable Jane Harm an (Dec. 22, 2005), at 1-3,\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/pdf/12%2022%2005%20NSA%20letter.pdf.  The TSP, in addition,\noperated without a court order.  Press  Briefing by Alberto Gonzales, At t’y Gen.,\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/print/20051219-1.html.\nIn arguing that the  TSP did  not violate FISA, the governm ent contends that Congress\nauthorized such warrantless electronic surveillance when it passed the AUMF.  The AUMF states\nin pertinent part\n[t]hat the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against\nthose nations, organizations, or persons he determ ines planned, authorized,\ncommitted, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Septem ber 11, 2001, or\nharbored such organizations or persons, in order to pre vent any future acts of\ninternational terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or\npersons.\nPub. L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (Sept. 18, 2001).  \nAccording to the government, the AUMF provides the authorization ne cessary to satisfy\nFISA’s prohibition on electronic surveillan ce “except as authorized by statute.”   See 50 U.S.C.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 60\n§ 1809(a).  No reference to surveillance, howeve, ris found in the AUMF.  Instead, the governemnt’s\nargument rests on a general inference to be drawn from the AUMF; in other words, that the phrase\n“all necessary and appropriate force” encompasses electronic surveillance by implication.  But this\ninterpretation of the AUMF directly conflicts with the specific statutory language of both FISA and\nTitle III.\nIn particular, the government’s argument requires us to accept that the AUMF has implicitly\nrepealed the “exclusive means” provision of Title III.  See 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f).  The problem\nwith this position is that neither the caselaw nor  the rules of s tatutory construction support the\ngovernment’s argument.  Certainly the expre ss language of t he AUMF cannot sustain such an\ninterpretation because, as noted above, it says nothing about electronic surveillance.  In 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2511, Congress criminalized the undertaking of electronic surveillance except as “specifically\nprovided in this chapter” or as authorized by FISA.  The AUMF is neither “in this chapter” nor\ndesignated as an amendment to FISA.  In order to give the government’s argument effect then, the\nAUMF must either repeal the “excl usive means” provision of the original FISA legislation as\ncodified in Title III or work in conjunction with FISA.  \n“Repeals by implication are not favored,” Ex parte Yerger, 75 U.S. 85, 105 (1868), and are\nappropriate only when established by “overwhelming evidence” that Congress intended the repeal\nand “when the earlier and later stat utes are irreconcilable.”   J.E.M. Ag. Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer\nHi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 534 U.S. 124, 137, 141-42 (2001).  In the present situation, the statutes are easily\nreconciled:  FISA places limits on the means by which the President may fulfill his duties under the\nAUMF.  The President is free to engage in surveillance without a warrant up to the lim its set by\nCongress when it enacted FISA, which is in keeping with Congress’s stated purpose “to curb the\npractice by which the Executive Branch may conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on its own\nunilateral determination that national security justifies it.”  S. Rep. No. 95-604, pt. I, at 8r, eprinted\nat 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3904, 3910.  \nFISA, as noted previously, includes explicit provisions for wartime usage.  The government\nargues that if the AUMF has not implicitly repealed the exclusive-means provision, then the AUMF\nand FISA must be in conflict, and that the AUMF should trump FISA.  This disregards the fact that\nshortly after enacting the AUMF, Congress am ended certain provisions of  FISA through its\nenactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, as described above.  Congress thus saw no conflict between\nFISA and the AUMF.  Cf. al-Marri v. Wright, No. 06-7427, — F.3d — , —,  2007 WL 1663712,\nat *22 (4th Cir. Jun. 11, 2007) (concluding that Congress’s enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act,\nwith specific provisions relating to the detention of “terrorist aliens”s uch as the plaintiff, “provides\nstill another reason why we cannot assume that Congress silently empowered the President in the\nAUMF to order the indefinite military detention without any criminal process of civilian ‘terrorist\naliens’ as ‘enemy combatants’”).\nIn addition, the government’s argument completely ignores two fundamental principles of\nstatutory construction.  The first relevant principle is that when interpreting potentially conflicting\nstatutes, “a more specific statute will be given precedence over a more general one, regardless of\ntheir temporal sequence.”  Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 406 (1980); see also Morales v.\nTWA, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 384-85 (1992) (noting that a spefciic and “carefully drawn” statute prevails\nover a more general one).  FISA’s provisions regarding wartime electronic surveillance are detailed\nand specific.  The AUMF, in contrast, sweeps broadly, m aking no reference at all to electronic\nsurveillance.  \nTo read the statutes as the government suggests would render FISA’s provisions relating to\nwartime usage mere surplusage.  Such a reading would run counter to the second relevant principle\nof statutory construction that requires courts to “give effect, if possible, to every clause and word\nof a statute.”  Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152 (1883);s ee also United States v. Perry, 360\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 61\nF.3d 519, 538 (6th Cir. 2004) (discussi ng the rule against surplusage in statutory construction).\nThus, FISA prevails over the AUMF with respect to electronic surveillance in the context of this\ncase.   \nIn addition, the government’s reading of the phrase “except as authorized by statute” strains\nthe legislative record.   See Elizabeth B. Bazan & Jennifer K. Elsea, Cong. Research Serv.,\nPresidential Authority to Conduct Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Gather Foreign\nIntelligence Information, at 40 (Jan. 5, 2006), http://www.fa.sorg/sgp/crs/intel/m010506.pdf (noting\nthat “the legislative history appears to reflect anin tention that the phrase ‘authorized by statute’ was\na reference to chapter 119 of Title 18 of the U.S.  Code (Title III) and to FISA itself, rather than\nhaving a broader meaning”).  I accordingly believe that the legislative history does not support the\ngovernment’s reading.\nThe government also contends that the AUMF can be read as a more specific statute than\nFISA based on recent Suprem e Court jurisprudence.  In  Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 519\n(2004), a plurality of the Court concluded that “[b]ecause detention to prevent a combatant’s return\nto the battlefield is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the use of ‘necessary and\nappropriate force,’ Congress has clearly and unm istakably authorized detention i n the narrow\ncircumstances considered here.”  The plurality  then reached the conclusion that “the AUMF is\nexplicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the na rrow category we\ndescribe,” namely individuals who were “part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States\nor coalition partners in Afghanistan and who engaged in an armed conflict against the United States\nthere.”   Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 516-17 (plurality) (quotation m arks omitted).  Despite the stated\nnarrowness of this holding, the governm ent argues that  Hamdi allows us to read the AUMF as\nauthorizing “signals intelligence” gathering on al-Qaeda and other suspected terrorists, and to\nconstrue such signals intelligence as including electronic surveillance targeting U.S. persons inside\nthis country.  \nBut FISA’s wartime provision distinguishes the present situation from that raised inH  amdi.\nCongress had not enacted a law at the time of the Hamdi decision that specifically authorized the\nunlimited detention of American citizens during wartime, and the effect of that legislative omission\nwas the subject of the analysis in the Hamdi decision.  542 U.S. at 516-25.  In contrast, Congress\nhas enacted a law (FISA) that specif ically authorizes electronic surveillance within the U.S. f or\nforeign intelligence purposes, and has specifically included a provision dealing with times of war.\n50 U.S.C. § 1811.  What was thus found to be a reasonable exercise of authority where Congress\nhad been silent becomes an unreasonable exercise where Congress has plainly spoken.  See also\nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)\n(discussing the authority of the President and how it relates to congressional enactments). \nFinally, the Supreme Court’s more recent decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S. Ct. 2749\n(2006), clearly rejected the government’s theory of the AUMF.  The Court in Hamdan declined to\nread the AUMF as implicitly authorizing the President to override a provision in the Uniofrm Code\nof Military Justice (UCMJ) that sets forth thec onditions for convening military commissions in lieu\nof courts-martial.  “[T]here is nothing in the text or legislative history of the AUMF even hinting\nthat Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the UCMJ.”\nHamdan, 126 S. Ct. at 2775.  \nThe same observation holds true in the present case.  Nothing in the AUMF suggests that\nCongress intended to “expand or alter the authorization” set forth in FISA.  Moreover, the text and\nthe legislative history of FISA and Title III make quite clear that the TSP or a similar program can\nbe authorized only through those two statutes.   The TSP plainly violated FISA and Title III and,\nunless there exists som e authority f or the Presid ent to supersede this statutory aut hority, was\ntherefore unlawful.  \n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 62\n2. Inherent authority\nThe government’s final defense is that the Constitution grants the President the “inherent\nauthority” to “intercept the international com munications of those affiliated with al Qaeda.”  A\ncontrary position would, according to the government, “present a grave constitutional question of\nthe highest order.”  For that reason, the government contends that we should follow the canon of\nconstitutional  avoidance and construe FISA and the AUMF to avoid any constitutional conflict.\nSee Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568,\n575 (1988) (discussing the canon of constitutional avoidance).  \nBut the canon of constitutional avoidance “is  not a method of adjudicating constitutional\nquestions by other means.”  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005) (discussing the role played\nby the canon of constitutional avoidance in statutoryi nterpretation).  Instead, its purpose is to allow\ncourts to construe a statute so as to avoid serious constitutional problesm, “unless such construction\nis plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.”  DeBartolo, 485 U.S. at 575 (emphasis added).\nThe Constitution divides the nation’s war powesr between the Executive and the Legislative\nBranches.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8 (setting forth the powers of Congress) & art. II, § 2 (setting\nforth the powers of the President); see also Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring)\n(noting that the powers of the President “depend[] upon their disjunction or conjunction with those\nof Congress”).  In contrast to the government’s suggestion, the President does not have exclusive\nwar powers.  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8 (setting forth the affirmative powers of the Congress, including\nthe power “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the\nforegoing Powers”).  \nThe Constitution expressly grants Congress the powe tro make laws in the context of national\ndefense.  Id.  Moreover, the Constitution requires the President to conform to duly enacted laws.\nU.S. Const. art. II, § 3 (“[ H]e shall take Care  that the Laws be f aithfully executed.”).  This\nrequirement endures even in times of war.  In Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170, 177-78\n(1804), for example, the Supreme Court held that duirng the “Quasi War” with France, the President\ncould not give instructions that ran counter to a validly ena cted statute, despite the fact that the\nPresident’s construction seemed to give the law better effect.  The Supreme Court reiterated this\nprinciple in Ex Parte Milligan, 71 U.S. (4 Wall) 2 (1866), holding that the Habeas Corpus Act of\n1863 barred the President from denying habeas corpus rights to a detainee who was captured outside\nthe area of battle.  More recently, the Court held in Hamdan that the President “may not disregard\nlimitations that Congress has, in proper exercise  of its own war powers , placed on his powers.”\nHamdan, 126 S. Ct. at 2774 n. 23 (citing Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring)).\nThe Supreme Court fully addressed the question of the inherent authority of the President\nin Youngstown.  There, the Court struck down Presidetn Truman’s executive order to seize domestic\nsteel-production facilities during the Korean war.I n  his famous concurring opinion, Justice Jackson\ndescribed our tripartite system  as one of  “s eparateness but interdependence, autonomy but\nreciprocity.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  “Presidential powers are not\nfixed but fluctuate, depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.”  Id.\nHe then laid out the three so-called zones of presidential power as follows: \n1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of\nCongress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses\nin his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. . . . \n2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial\nof authority, he can only rely upon hiso wn independent powers, but there is\na zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority,\nor in which its distribution is uncertain. . . . \n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 63\n3. When the President takes m easures incompatible with the expressed or\nimplied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely\nonly upon his own constitutional powersm  inus any constitutional powers of\nCongress over the matter.\nId. at 635-37.  \nWhen the President acts in Zone 3, “[c]ourts can sustain exclusive Presidential control in\nsuch a case only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.  Presidential claim to a\npower at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is\nthe equilibrium established by our constitutional system.”  Id. at 637-38 (footnote omitted).\nWe must thus determine into which zone the TSP fits.  From that determination, the program\nwill stand or fall.  The government argues that the TSP fits into Zone 1, where the President’s\nauthority is at its zenith.  But this argument ignores Congress’s clear directive that FISA and Title\nIII constitute the exclusive means for undertaking electronic surveillance within the United States\nfor foreign intelligence purposes.  The result might not be what the President would prefer, but that\ndoes not give him  license to “disregard lim itations” that Congress has “placed on his powers.”\nHamdan, 126 S. Ct. at 2774 n.23.  In light of FISA and Title III, I have no doubt that the TSP falls\ninto Zone 3, where the President’s authority is at its lowest ebb.\nThe government, however, turns to a case from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\nof Review as support for its argument that the President has “inherent constitutional authority to\nconduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance.”  See In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 746\n(For. Intel. Surv. Ct. Rev. 2002) (per curiam).  To be sure, theS ealed Case court stated in dicta that\n“[w]e take for granted that the President does have” the “inherent authority to conduct warrantless\nsearches to obtain foreign intelligence inform ation.”   Id. at 742.  This  dicta, however, is\nunpersuasive because the Sealed Case court relied on a Fourth Circuit decision from 1980 that dealt\nwith a challenge to pre-FISA surveillance. I d. (discussing United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629\nF.2d 908, 914 n.4 (4th Cir. 1980)).\nThe Sealed Case court discussed Truong for the purpose of determining whether the Fourth\nCircuit had articulated the proper constitutional standard f or evaluating a Fourth Am endment\nchallenge to FISA.  Id. at 742-44.  Finding that Truong did set forth the proper standard, theS ealed\nCase court applied the same standard to uphold the post-PATRIOT Act version of FISA against a\nFourth Amendment challenge.  Id. at 742.  In sum, the dicta inS ealed Case cannot overcome the fact\nthat Congress has unequivocally acted within its  constitutional power to l imit the President’s\nauthority over warrantless electronic surveillance within this country. \nFinally, all of the courts to have considered the question of whether FISA was constitutional\nbefore the statute was amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 have in fact upheld the statute.\nSee United States v. Nicholson , 955 F. Supp. 588, 590 n.3 (E.D. Va. 1997) (collecting case s\nupholding FISA against various constitutional challenges).  Those courts that have considered the\nconstitutionality of FISA since it was amended by the USA PATRIOT Act have likewise upheld the\nstatute against constitutional challenges. S ee United States v. Ning Wen, 477 F.3d 896, 898-99 (7th\nCir. 2007) (finding no conflict with the Fourth Amendment where evidence obtained pursuant to a\nFISA court order was used in a criminal prosecution); United States v. Damrah, 412 F.3d 618, 625\n(6th Cir. 2005) (noting that “FISA has uniform ly been held to be consistent with the Fourth\nAmendment”); In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d at 746.  In light of these persuasive authorities, I find\nno merit to the government’s “inherent authority” argument. \n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al. Page 64\nE. Plaintiffs’ datamining cross-appeal\nThe plaintiffs raise a cross-appeal from the district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\ngovernment on the plaintiffs’ datamining claim.  After a careful review of the record, I conclude that\nthe district court’s analysis of this issue and of the preclusive effect of the state-secrets privilege is\npersuasive.  I would therefore not disturb the disrtict court’s judgment on the plaintiffs’ datamining\nclaim.\nII.  CONCLUSION\nThe closest question in this case, in my opinion, is whether the plaintiffs have the standing\nto sue.  Once past that hurdle, however, the resgte ts progressively easier.  Mootness is not a problem\nbecause of the government’s position that it retains the right to opt out of the FISA regime whenever\nit chooses.  Its AUMF and inherent-authority arguments are weak in lighto f existing precedent and\nthe rules of statutory construction.  Finally, when faced with the clear wording of FISA and Title\nIII that these statutes provide the “exclusive m eans” for the government to engage in electronic\nsurveillance within the United States f or foreign intelligence purposes, the conclusion becom es\ninescapable that the TSP was unlawful.  I would therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nNos. 06-2095/2140 Am. Civil Liberties Union, et al. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, et al.

Introduction\nThis is a challenge to the legality of  a secret program (hereinafter “TSP”) undisputedly\ninaugurated by the National Security Agency (hereinafter “NSA”) at least by 2002 and continuing\ntoday, which intercepts without benefit of warrant or other judicial approval, prior or subsequent,\nthe international telephone and internet communications of numerous persons and organizations\n1\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 2 of 44 \nwithin this country.  The TSP has been acknowledged by this Adm inistration to have been\nauthorized by the President’s secret order during 2002 and reauthorized at least thirty times since.1\nPlaintiffs are a group of persons and organiza tions who, according to their affidavits, are\ndefined by the Foreign Intelligence SurveillanceA  ct (hereinafter “FISA”) as “U.S. persons.”2  They\nconducted regular international telephone and internet communications for various uncontestedly\nlegitimate reasons including journalism , the practice of  law, and scholarship.  Many of their\ncommunications are and have been with persons in the Middle East.  Each Plaintiff has alleged a\n“well founded belief” that he, she, or it, has been subjected to Defendants’ interceptions, and that\nthe TSP not only injures them specifically and directly, but that the TSP substantially chills and\nimpairs their constitutionally protected communications.  Persons abroad who before the program\nspoke with them by telephone or internet will no longer do so.\nPlaintiffs have alleged that the TSP violates  their free speech and associational rights, as\nguaranteed by the First Am endment of the United  States Constitution; their privacy rights, as\nguaranteed by the Fourth Am endment of the United States Constitution; the principle of  the\nSeparation of Powers because the TSP has been authorized by the President in excess of his\nExecutive Power under Article II of the United States Constitution, and that it specifically violates\nthe statutory limitations placed upon such interceptions by the Congress in FISA be cause it is\nconducted without observation of any of the pr ocedures required by law, either statutory or\nConstitutional.\nBefore the Court now are several motions filed by both sides.  Plaintiffs have requested a\n1Available at http://www.white-house.gov//news/releases/2005/12/20051219-2.html\n2Pub. L. 95-511, Title I, 92 Stat 1976 (Oct. 25, 1978), codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq. \n2\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 3 of 44 \npermanent injunction, alleging t hat they sustai n irreparable dam age because of the continued\nexistence of the TSP.  Plaintiffs also request a Partial Sum mary Judgment holding that the TSP\nviolates the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”); the Separation of Powers doctrine; the First\nand Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and the statutory law.\nDefendants have moved to dismiss this lawsuit, or in the alternative for Summary Judgment,\non the basis of the state secrets evidentiary privilege and Plaintiffs’ lack of standing.\nII.  State Secrets Privilege\nDefendants argue that the state secrets privilege bars Plaintiffs’ claims because Plaintiffs\ncannot establish standing or a  prima facie case for any of their claim s without the use of state\nsecrets.  Further, Defendants argue that they cnanot defend this case without revealing state secrets.\nFor the reasons articulated below, the court rejecst Defendants’ argument with respect to Plaintiffs’\nclaims challenging the TSP.  The court, however, agrees with Defendants with respect to Plaintiffs’\ndata- mining claim and grants Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on that claim.    \nThe state secrets privilege i s an evidentiary  rule developed to prevent the disclosure of\ninformation which may be detrimental to national security.  There are two distinct lines of cases\ncovering the privilege.  In the first line of cases the doctrine is more of a rule of “non-justiciability\nbecause it deprives courts of their ability to h ear suits against the G overnment based on covert\nespionage agreements.”  El-Masri v. Tenet, 2006 WL 1391390 at 7 (E.D.Va., 2006). The seminal\ndecision in this line of cases is Totten v. United States 92 U.S. 105 (1875).  In Totten, the plaintiff\nbrought suit against the government seeking payment for espionage services he had provided during\nthe Civil War.  In affirming the dismissal of the case, Justice Field wrote: \nThe secrecy which such contracts im pose precludes any action for\ntheir enforcement. The publicity produced by an action would itself\n3\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 4 of 44 \nbe a breach of a contract of t hat kind, and thus defeat a recovery.\nTotten, 92 U.S. at 107.\nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed Totten in Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, (2005).   In Tenet, the\nplaintiffs, who were former Cold War spies, brought estoppel and due process claims against the\nUnited States and the Director o fthe Central Intelligence Agency (hereinafter “CIA”) for the CIA’s\nalleged failure to provide them with the assistance it had allegedly promised in return for their\nespionage services.   Tenet, 544 U.S. at 3.  Relying heavily on  Totten, the Court held that the\nplaintiffs claims were barred.  Delivering the opinion for a unanim ous Court, Chief J ustice\nRehnquist wrote:\nWe adhere to  Totten. The state secrets privilege and the m ore\nfrequent use ofi n camera judicial proceedings simply cannot provide\nthe absolute protection we found necessary in enunciating theT otten\nrule. The possibility that a suit m ay proceed and an espionage\nrelationship may be revealed, if the state secrets privilege is found not\nto apply, is unacceptable: “Even a small chance that some court will\norder disclosure of a source’s identity could well impair intelligence\ngathering and cause sources to ‘close up like a clam .’” (citations\nomitted).  Tenet, 544 U.S. at 11.\nThe second line of cases deals with the exclusion of evidence because of the state secrets\nprivilege.  In United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953), the plaintiffs were the widows of three\ncivilians who died in the crash of a B-29 aircraft.  Id. at 3-4.  The plaintiffs brought suit under the\nTort Claims Act and sought the production of the Air Force’s official accident investigation report\nand the statements of the three surviving crew members.  Id.  The Government asserted the states\nsecret privilege to resist the discovery of this information, because the aircraft in question and those\naboard were engaged in a highly secret mission of the Air Force.  Id. at 4.  In discussing the state\nsecrets privilege and its application, Chief Justice Vinson stated:\nThe privilege belongs to the Government and must be asserted by it;\n4\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 5 of 44 \nit can neither be claimed nor waived by a private party.  It is not to be\nlightly invoked.  There must be formal claim of privilege, lodged by\nthe head of the department which has control over the matter, after\nactual personal consideration by that officer.  The court itself mus t\ndetermine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of\nprivilege, and yet do so without forcnig a disclosure of the very thing\nthe privilege is designed to protect.   Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 8. \nThe Chief Justice further wrote: \nIn each case, the showing of necessity which is made will determine\nhow far the court should probe in satisfying itself that the occasion\nfor invoking the privilege is appropriate. Where there is a strong\nshowing of necessity, the claim  of privilege should not be lightly\naccepted, but even the most compelling necessity cannot overcome\nthe claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military\nsecrets are at stake.  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 11. \nThe Court sustained the Government’s claim of privilege, finding the plaintiffs’ “necessity” for the\nprivileged information was “greatly m inimized” by the fact that the plaintiffs had an available\nalternative.  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 11.  Moreover, the Court found that there was nothing to suggest\nthat the privileged information had a “causal connection with the accident” and that the plaintiffs\ncould “adduce the essential facts as to causation without resort to material touching upon military\nsecrets.”  Id.  \nIn Halkin v. Helms, 598 F.2d 1 (D.C.Cir.1978) (Halkin I ), the District of Columbia Circuit\nCourt applied the holding in Reynolds in a case in which the plaintiffs, Vietnam  War protestors,\nalleged that the defendants, former and present members of the NSA, the CIA, Deefnse Intelligence\nAgency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation a nd the Secret Service engaged in warrantless\nsurveillance of their international wire, cable and telephone communications with the cooperation\nof telecommunications providers.  Id. at 3.  The telecommunications providers were also named as\ndefendants.  Id.  The plaintiffs specifically challenged the legality of two separate NSA surveillance\n5\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 6 of 44 \noperations undertaken from 1967 to 1973 named operation MINARET and operation SHAMROCK3.\nId. at 4.\nThe Government asserted the state secrets pr ivilege and m oved for dism issal for the\nfollowing reasons: (1) discovery would “confirm the identity of individuals or organizations whose\nforeign communications were acquired by NSA”; (2) discovery would lead to the disclosure of\n“dates and contents of such communications”; or (3) discovery would “divulge the methods and\ntechniques by which the communications were acquired.”  Halkin, 598 F.2d at 4-5.  The district\ncourt held that the plaintiffs’ claims against operation MINARET had to be dismissed “because the\nultimate issue, the fact of acquisition, could neither be admitted nor denied.”  Id. at 5.  The district\ncourt, however, denied the Governm ent’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim s regarding\noperation SHAMROCK, because it “thought congressional committees investigating intelligence\nmatters had revealed so m uch information about operation SHAMROCK that s uch a disclosure\nwould pose no threat to the NSA mission.” Id. at 10.\nOn appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit Court affirmed the district court’s dismissal of\nthe plaintiffs’ claims with respect to operation MINARET but reversed the court’s ruling with\nrespect to operation SHAMROCK.  In reversing the district court ruling regarding SHAMROCK,\nthe circuit court stated:\n. . . we think the affidavits and testimony establish the validity of the\nstate secrets claim with respect to both SHAMROCK and MINARET\nacquisitions; our reasoning applies to bot h. There is a “reasonable\ndanger”, (citation om itted) that conf irmation or denial that a\nparticular plaintiff's communications have been acquired would\n3Operation MINARET was part of the NSA’s regular intelligence activity in which foreign electronic\nsignals were monitored.  Operation SHAMROCK involved the processing of all telegraphic traffic leaving or\nentering the United States.  Hepting v. AT & T Corp 2006 WL 2038464 (N.D.Cal.2006) quoting Halkin.  \n6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 7 of 44 \ndisclose NSA capabilities and other valuable intelligence information\nto a sophisticated intelligence analyst.  Halkin, 598 F.2d at 10. \nThe case was remanded to the district court and it dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the NSA\nand the individuals connected with the NSA’s alleged monitoring.  Halkin v. Helms, 690 F.2d 977,\n984 (D.C. Cir.1982) (Halkin II).\nIn Halkin II, 690 F.2d 977, the court addressed plaintiff’s remaining claims against the CIA,\nwhich the district court dismissed because of the state secrets privilege.  In affirm ing the district\ncourt’s ruling, the District of Columbia Circuit stated:\nIt is self-evident that the disclosures sought here pose a “reasonable\ndanger” to the diplomatic and military interests of the United States.\nRevelation of particular instances in w hich foreign governments\nassisted the CIA in conducting surveillance of dissidents could strain\ndiplomatic relations in a number of ways-by generally embarrassing\nforeign governments who may wish to avoid or may even explicitly\ndisavow allegations of CIA or United St ates involvements, or by\nrendering foreign governments or their officials subject to political\nor legal action by those among their own citizens who may have been\nsubjected to surveillance in the course of dissident activity.  Halkin\nII, 690 F.2d at 993.\nEllsberg v. Mitchell, 709 F.2d 51 (D.C. Cir.1983) was yet another case where the District\nof Columbia Circuit dealt with the state secrets privilege being raised in the defense of a claim of\nillegal wiretapping.  In  Ellsberg, the plaintiffs, the defendants and attorneys in the “Pentagon\nPapers” criminal prosecution brought suit when, durnig the course of that litigation, they discovered\n“that one or more of them had been the subject of warrantless electronic surveillance by the federal\nGovernment.” Id. at 51.  The defendants admitted to two wiretaps but refused to respond to some\nof the plaintiffs’ interrogatories, asserting the state secrets privilegeI. d . at 54.  The plaintiffs sought\nan order com pelling the information and the di strict court denied the m otion, sustaining the\nGovernment’s assertion of the state secrets privilege.   Id. at 56.  Further, the court dismissed the\n7\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 8 of 44 \nplaintiffs’ claims that pertained “to surveillance of  their foreign communications.”  Ellsberg v.\nMitchell, 709 F.2d at 56.\nOn appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the district court with respect to the\nplaintiffs’ claims regarding the Government’s admitted wiretaps, because there was no reason to\n“suspend the general rule that the burden is on those seeki ng an exem ption from the Fourth\nAmendment warrant requirement to show the need for it.”  Ellsberg, 709 F.2d at 68.  With respect\nto the application of the state secrets privilege, the court stated:\nWhen properly invoked, the state s ecrets privilege is absolute. No\ncompeting public or  private interest can be advanced to com pel\ndisclosure of inform ation found to be protected by a claim  of\nprivilege.  However, because of the broad sweep of the privilege, the\nSupreme Court has made clear that “[i]t is not to be lightly invoked.”\nThus, the privilege may not be used to shield any material not strictly\nnecessary to prevent injury to national security; and, whe never\npossible, sensitive inf ormation m ust be disentangled f rom\nnonsensitive inf ormation to allow   for the release of  the latter.\nEllsberg,  709 F.2d at 56. \nIn Kasza v. Browner, 133 F.3d 1159 (9th Cir.1998), the plaintiffs, former employees at a\nclassified United States Air Force facility, filed suit against the Air Force and the Environmental\nProtection Agency under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, alleging violations at the\nclassified facility.  Id. at 1162.  The district court granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs,\nbecause discovery of information necessary for the proof of the plaintiffs’ claims was impossible\ndue to the state secrets privilege.  Id.  In affirming the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nagainst one of the plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit stated:\nNot only does t he state secrets privilege bar [t he plaintiff] from\nestablishing her prima facie case on any of her eleven claims, but any\nfurther proceeding in this matter would jeopardize national security.\nNo protective procedure can salvage [the plaintiff’s] suit.K  asza, 133\nF.3d at 1170. \n8\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 9 of 44 \nThe Kasza court also explained that “[t]he application of the state secrets privilege can have\n. . . three effects.” Kasza, 133 F.3d at 1166.  First, when the privilege is properly invoked “over\nparticular evidence, the evidence is completely removed from the case.”  Id.  The plaintiff’s case,\nhowever, may proceed “based on evidence not covered by the privilege.” Id.  “If . . . the plaintiff\ncannot prove the prima facie elements of her claim with nonprivileged evidence, then the court may\ndismiss her claim as it would with any plaintiff who cannot prove her case.” Id.  Second, summary\njudgement may be granted, “if the privilege depr ives the defendant  of information that would\notherwise give the defendant a valid defens e to the claim.”   Id.  Lastly, “notwithstanding the\nplaintiff's ability to produce nonprivileged evidence, if the ‘very subject matter of the action’ is a\nstate secret, then the court should dismiss the plaintiff's action based solely on the invocation of the\nstate secrets privilege.” Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit delivered its definitive opinion regarding the states secrets privilege, in\nTenenbaum v. Simonini, 372 F.3d 776 (6th Cir. 2004).  In that case, the plaintiffs sued the United\nStates and various employees of federal agencies, alleging that the defendants engaged in criminal\nespionage investigation of the plaintiff,D  avid Tenenbaum, because he was Jewish. I d. at 777.  The\ndefendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they could not defend themselves against the\nplaintiffs’  “claims without disclosing information protected by the state secrets doctrine.” I d.  The\ndistrict court granted the defendants’ motion and the Sixth Circuit affirmed stating:\nWe further conclude that Defe ndants cannot defend their conduct\nwith respect to Tenenbaum  without revea ling the privileged\ninformation.  Because the state secrets doct rine thus deprives\nDefendants of a valid defense to the Tenenbaum s’ claims, we find\nthat the district court properly dismissed the claims.  Tenenbaum, 372\nF.3d at 777.\nPredictably, the War on Terror of this administration has produced a vast number of cases,\n9\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 10 of 44 \nin which the state secrets privilege has been invoked.4  In May of this year, a district court in the\nEastern District of Virginia addressed the state secrets privilege in  El-Masri v. Tenet, 2006 WL\n1391390,  (E.D. Va. May 12, 2006).  In  El Masri, the plaintiff, a Germ an citizen of Lebanese\ndescent,  sued the former director of the CIA and others, for their alleged involvement in a program\ncalled Extraordinary Rendition.  Id. at 1.   The court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims, because they\ncould not be fairly litigated without the disclosure of state secrets.5  Id. at 6.  \nIn Hepting v. AT & T Corp., 2006 WL 2038464, (E.D. Cal. June 20, 2006), which is akin to\nour inquiry in the instant case, the plaintiffs  brought suit, alleging that AT & T Corporation was\ncollaborating with the NSA in a warrantless su rveillance program, which illegally tracked the\ndomestic and foreign communications and communication records of millions of Americans.  Id.\nat 1.  The United States intervened and moved that the case be dismissed based on the state secrets\nprivilege.  Id.  Before applying the privilege to the plaintiffs’ claims, the court first examined the\ninformation that had already been exposed to the public, which is essentially the same information\nthat has been reve aled in the instant case.   District Court Judge Vaughn W alker found that the\nGovernment had admitted:\n. . . it monitors “contents of communications where * * * one party\nto the com munication is outside the United States a nd t he\ngovernment has a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the\ncommunication is a member of al Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or\na member of an organization affiliated with al Qaeda, or working in\nsupport of al Qaeda.”  (citations om itted).  Hepting, 2006 W L\n4In Terkel v. AT & T Corp., 2006 WL 2088202 (N.D. Ill. July 25, 2006), the plaintiffs alleged that AT&T\nprovided information regarding their telephone calls and internet communications to the NSA.  Id. at 1.  District\nCourt Judge Matthew F. Kennely dismissed the case because the state secrets privilege made it impossible for the\nplaintiffs to establish standing.  Id. at 20. \n5Further, the court was not persuaded by the plaintiff’s argument that the privilege was negated because the\nGovernment had admitted that the rendition program existed because it found the Government’s admissions to be\nwithout details.  \n10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 11 of 44 \n2038464, at 19.\nAccordingly Judge Walker reasoned that “[b]ased on these public disclosures,” the court could not\n“conclude that the existence of a certification regarding the ‘communication content’ program is a\nstate secret.”  Id.\nDefendants’ assertion of the privilege withouta ny request for answers to any discovery has\nprompted this court to first analyze this case under Totten/Tenet, since it appears that Defendants\nare arguing that this case should not be subj ect to judicial review.  As discussed  supra, the\nTotten/Tenet cases provide an absolute bar to any kind of judicial review.T  enet, 544 U.S. at 8.  This\nrule should not be applied in the instant case, however, since the rule applies to actions where there\nis a secret espionage relationship betw een the Plaintiff and the Governm ent.  Id. at 7-8.  It is\nundisputed that Plaintiffs’ do not claim  to be  parties to a secret espionage relationship with\nDefendants.  Accordingly, the court finds theT otten/Tenet rule is not applicable to the instant case.\nThe state secrets privilege belongs exclusively to the Executive Branch and thus, it is appropriately\ninvoked by the head of t he Executive Branch agency with control over the secrets involved.\nReynolds, 345 U.S. at 1.  In the instant case, the  court is satisfied that the privilege was properly\ninvoked.  De fendants’ publicly-filed affidavits  from Director of National Intelligence John D.\nNegroponte and Signal Intelligence Director, NSA Major General Richard J. Quirk, set forth facts\nsupporting the Government’s contention that the state secrets privilege and other legal doctrines\nrequired dism issal of the case.  Additionally, Defendants filed classified versions of these\ndeclarations ex parte and in camera for this court’s review.  Defendants also filed ex parte and in\ncamera versions of its brief along with other classified materials, further buttressing its assertion of\nthe privilege.  Plaintiffs concede that the public declaration from Director Negroponte satisfies the\n11\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 12 of 44 \nprocedural requirements set forth inR  eynolds.  Therefore, this court concludes that the privilege has\nbeen appropriately invoked.\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed because Plaintiffs cannot establish\nstanding or a prima facie case for any of its claims without the disclosure of state secrets.  Moreover,\nDefendants argue that even if Plaintiffs are able to establish a prima facie case without revealing\nprotected information, Defendants would be unable to defend this case without the disclosure of\nsuch information.  Plaintiffs argue that Defenda nts’ invocation of the s tate secrets privilege is\nimproper with respect to their challenges to th e TSP, since no additional facts are necessary or\nrelevant to the summary adjudication of this case.  Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue, that even if the\ncourt finds that the privilege was appropriately asserted, the court should  use creativity and care to\ndevise methods which would protect the privilege but allow the case to proceed.  \nThe “next step in the judicial inquiry into the validity of the assertion of the privilege is to\ndetermine whether the information for which the privilege is claimed qualifies as a state secret.”\nEl Masri, 2006 WL 1391390, at 4.  Again, the court acknowledges that it has reviewed all of the\nmaterials Defendants submitted ex parte and in camera.  After reviewing these materials, the court\nis convinced that the privilege  applies “because a reasonable danger exists that disclosing the\ninformation in court proceedings would harm national security interests, or would impair national\ndefense capabilities, disclose intelligence-gathering methods or capabilities, or disrupt diplomatic\nrelations with foreign governments.”  Tenenbaum, 372 F.3d at 777.  \nPlaintiffs, however, maintain that this information is not relevant to the resolution of their\nclaims, since their claims regarding the TSP are based solely on what Defendants have publicly\nadmitted.  Indeed, although the instant case appears factually similar to Halkin, in that they both\n12\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 13 of 44 \ninvolve plaintiffs challenging the legality o fwarrantless wiretapping, a key distinction can be drawn.\nUnlike Halkin or any of the cases in the  Reynolds progeny, Plaintiffs here are not seeking any\nadditional discovery to establish their claims challenging the TSP.6  \nLike Judge Walker in Hepting, this court recognizes that simply because a factual statement\nhas been made public it does not necessarily follow that it is true.  Hepting, 2006 WL 2038464 at\n12.  Hence, “in determining whether a factual statement is a secret, the court considers only public\nadmissions or denials by the [G]overnm ent.”  Id. at 13.  It is undisputed that Defendants have\npublicly admitted to the following:( 1)  the TSP exists; (2) it operatse without warrants; (3) it targets\ncommunications where one party to the com munication is outside the United States, and the\ngovernment has a reasonable basis to conclude tha tone party to the communication is a member of\nal Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or a m ember of an organization af filiated with al Qaeda, or\nworking in support of al Qaeda.  As the Government has on many occasions confirmed the veracity\nof these allegations, the state secrets privilege does not apply to this information.    \nContrary to Defendants’ arguments, the court is persuaded that Plaintiffs are able to establish\na prima facie case based solely on Defendants’ public admissions regarding the TSP.  Plaintiffs’\ndeclarations establish that their com munications would be m onitored under the TSP. 7  Further,\nPlaintiffs have shown t hat because of the existe nce of the TSP, they have suffered a real and\nconcrete harm.  Plaintiffs’ declarations state undisputedly that they are stifled in their ability to\n6In Halkin, the plaintiffs were requesting that the Government answer interrogatories and sought to depose\nthe secretary of defense.  Halkin, 598 F.2d at 6.  \n7See generally, in a Declaration, attorney Nancy Hollander stated that she frequently engages in\ninternational communications with individuals who have alleged connections with terrorist organizations.  (Exh. J,\nHollander ).   Attorney William Swor also provided a similar declaration. (Exh. L, Swor Decl. ).   Journalist Tara\nMcKelvey declared that she has international communications with sources who are suspected of helping the\ninsurgents in Iraq.  (Exh. K, McKelvey Decl.).   \n13\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 14 of 44 \nvigorously conduct research, interact with sources, talk with clients and, in the case of the attorney\nPlaintiffs, uphold their oath of providing effective and ethical representation of their clients.8  In\naddition, Plaintiffs have the additional injury of incurring substantial travel expenses as a result of\nhaving to travel and meet with clients and others relevant to their cases.  Therefore, the court finds\nthat Plaintiffs need no additional f acts to establish a  prima facie  case for any of their claim s\nquestioning the legality of the TSP.  \nThe court, however, is convinced that Plaintiffs cannot establish ap rima facie case to support\ntheir data- mining claims without the use of privileged information and further litigation of this issue\nwould  force the disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect.  Therefore, the\ncourt grants Defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to this claim.  \nFinally, Defendants assert that they cannot defend this case without the exposure of state\nsecrets.  This court disagrees.  The Bush Administration has repeatedly told the general public that\nthere is a valid basis in law ofr the TSP.9  Further, Defendants have contended that the President has\nthe authority under the  AUMF and the Constitution to authorize the continued use of  the TSP.\nDefendants have supported these argum ents wit hout revealing or  r elying on any classified\ninformation.  Indeed, the court has reviewed the clsasified information and is of the opinion that this\ninformation is not necessary to any viable defense to the TSP.   Defendants have presented support\n8Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Facts (hereinafter “SUF”) SUF 15 (Exh. J, Hollander Decl. ¶¶12, 16,\n25; Exh. L, Swor Decl. ¶¶9, 11-12, 14-16);Plaintiffs;’ Reply Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment (hereinafter “Pl.’s Reply”) (Exh. P,  Dratel Decl. ¶¶9-11; Exh. Q, Abdrabboh Decl.\n¶¶7-8; Exh. R. Ayad. Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6-8); (Exh. M  Niehoff Decl. ¶¶ 12 ).\n9On December 17, 2005, in a radio address, President Bush stated: \nIn the weeks following the terrorist attacks on our nation, I authorized the\nNational Security Agency, consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution, to\nintercept the international communications of people with known links to al\nQaeda and related terrorist organizations.\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051217.html\n14\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 15 of 44 \nfor the argument that “it . .  is well-established  that the President may exercise his statutory and\nconstitutional authority to gather intelligence information about foreign enemies.”10  Defendants cite\nto various sources to support this position.  Consqeuently, the court finds Defendants’ argument that\nthey cannot defend this case without the use of acslsified information to be disingenuous and without\nmerit.  \nIn sum, the court holds that the state secrets pivrilege applies to Plaintiffs’ data-mining claim\nand that claim is dismissed.  The privilege, however, does not apply to Plaintiffs’ remaining claims\nchallenging the validity of the TSP, since Plaintiffs are not relying on or requesting any classified\ninformation to support these claims and Defendants do not need any classified information to mount\na defense against these claims.11 \nIII.  Standing\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs do not establishth eir standing.  They contend that Plaintiffs’\nclaim here is merely a subjective fear of surveillance which falls short of the type of injury necessary\nto establish standing.  They argue that Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are too tenuous to be recognized,\nnot “distinct and palpable” nor  “concrete and particularized.” \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution lim its the federal court’s jurisdiction to “cases” and\n“controversies”.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  To have a genuine case\nor controversy, the plaintiff m ust establish standing.  “[T]he core com ponent of standing is an\nessential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.”   Lujan v.\n10Defendants’ Brief in Support of Summary Judgment pg. 33. \n11Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred because they properly invoked statutory\nprivileges under the National Security Agency Act of 1959, 50 U.S.C. § 402 and the Intelligence Reform and\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004, 50 U.S.C. § 403-(i)(1).  Again, these privileges are not availing to Defendants\nwith respect to Plaintiffs’ claims challenging the TSP, for the same reasons that the state secrets privilege does not\nbar these claims.      \n15\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 16 of 44 \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 560.  To establish standing under Article III, a plaintif f must\nsatisfy the following three requirements: (1) “the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact - an\ninvasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; (2) “t here must be a causal connection between the\ninjury and the conduct complained of”, and (3) “itm  ust be likely, as opposed to merely speculative,\nthat the injury will be redressed by a favor able decision.”  Id. at 560-561.  The party invoking\nfederal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.  Id. at 561. \n“An association has standing tob ring suit on behalf of its members when its members would\notherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the\norganization’s purpose, and neither the claim  asserted nor the relief requested requi res the\nparticipation of individual m embers in the lawsuit.”   Friends of the Earth, I nc. v. Laidlaw\nEnvironmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (citing  Hunt v. Washington State\nApple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 342 (1977)).\n “At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s\nconduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we ‘presume that general allegations embrace those\nspecific facts that are necessary to support the claim .’ ” Id. at 561 (quoting  Lujan v. National\nWildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 889 (1990)).  “In response to a motion for summary judgment,\nhowever, the plaintiff can no longer rest upon such  ‘mere allegations,’ but m ust ‘set forth’ by\naffidavit or other evidence ‘specific facts ’Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 56(e), which for purposes of the summary\njudgment motion will be taken to be true.”  Id.  This court is persuaded that Plaintiffs in this case\nhave set forth the necessary facts to have satisfi ed all three of the prerequisites listed above to\nestablish standing. \n16\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 17 of 44 \nTo determine whether Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the TSP,\nwe must examine the nature of the injury-in-fact which they have alleged.  “The injury must be ...\n‘distinct and palpable,’ and not ‘abstract’ or ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical.’”   National Rifle\nAssociation of America v. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, 280 (6th Cir. 1997) (citingA  llen v. Wright, 468 U.S\n737, 751 (1982)).\nPlaintiffs here contend that the TSP has interf ered with their ability to carry out their\nprofessional responsibilities in a variety of ways, including that the TSP has had a significant piamct\non their ability to talk with sources, locate witnesses, conduct scholarship, engage in advocacy and\ncommunicate with persons who are outside of the United States, including in the Middle East and\nAsia.  Plaintiffs have submitted several declarations to that ef fect.  For example, scholars and\njournalists such as plaintiffs Tara McKelvey, Larry Diamond, and Barnett Rubin indicate that they\nmust conduct extensive research in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, and must communicate with\nindividuals abroad whom the United States government believes to be terrorist suspects or to be\nassociated with terrorist organizations.12   In addition, attorneys Nancy Hollander, William Swor,\nJoshua Dratel, Mohammed Abdrabboh, and Nabih Ayad indicate that they must also communicate\nwith individuals abroad whom the United States government believes to be terrorist suspects or to\nbe associated with terrorist organizations1,3 and must discuss confidential information over the phone\nand email with their international clients.14    All of the Plaintiffs contend that the TSP has caused\nclients, witnesses and sources to discontinue their communications with plaintiffs out of fear that\n12SUF 15B (Exh.

As University of Michigan legal ethics professor Leonard Niehoff explains, attorney-\nclient confidentiality is “central to the functioning of the attorney-client relationship and to effective\nrepresentation.”17  He further explains that Defendants’ TSP “creates an overwhelm ing, if not\ninsurmountable, obstacle to effective and ethical representation” and that although Plaintiffs are\nresorting to other “inefficient” m eans for ga thering information, the TSP cont inues to cause\n“substantial and ongoing harm to the attorney-client relationships and legal representations.”18  He\nexplains that the increased risk that privilegedc ommunications will be intercepted forces attorneys\nto cease telephonic and electronic com munications w ith clients to f ulfill their ethical\nresponsibilities.19\nDefendants argue that the allegations present no more than a “chilling effect” based upon\npurely speculative fears that the TSP subjects the Plaintiffs to surveillance.  In arguing that the\ninjuries are not constitutionally cognizable, Defendants rely heavily on the case ofL aird v. Tatum,\n408 U.S. 1 (1972).\n15SUF 15 (Exh. J, Hollander Decl. ¶¶12, 16, 25; Exh.

The plaintiffs argued\nthat the surveillance created a chilling ef fect on their First Am endment rights caused by the\nexistence and operation of  the surveillance program in general.   Id. at 3.  The Suprem e Court\nrejected the plaintiffs’ efforts to rest standnig upon the mere “chill” that the program cast upon their\nassociational activities.  It said that the “jurisdiction of a federal court may [not] be invoked by a\ncomplainant who alleges that the exercise o fhis First Amendment rights is being chilled by the mere\nexistence, without more, of a governmental investigative and data-gathering activity.”I d . (emphasis\nadded) \nLaird, however, must be distinguished here.  The plaintiffs in Laird alleged only that they\ncould conceivably become subject to the Arm y’s domestic surveillance program.  Presbyterian\nChurch v. United States, 870 F.2d 518, 522 (1989) (citingL aird v. Tatum, 408 U.S at 13) (emphasis\nadded).  The Plaintiffs here are not merely alleging that they “could conceivably” become subject\nto surveillance under the TSP, but that continuation of the TSP has damaged them.  The President\nindeed has publicly acknowledged that the types of calls Plaintiffs are m aking are the types of\nconversations that would be subject to the TSP.20\nAlthough Laird establishes that a party’s allegation that it has suffered a subjective “chill”\nalone does not confer Article III standing,L aird does not control this case.   As Justice (then Judge)\n20In December 2005, the President publicly acknowledged that the TSP intercepts the contents of certain\ncommunications as to which there are reasonable grounds to believe that (1) the communication originated or\nterminated outside the United States, and (2) a party to such communication is a member of al Qaeda, a member of a\ngroup affiliated with al Qaeda, or an agent of al Qaeda or its affiliates. Available at http://www.white-\nhouse.gov//news/releases/2005/12/20051219-2.html.   \n19\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 20 of 44 \nBreyer has observed, “[t]he problem  for the govern ment with Laird . . . lies in the key words\n‘without more.’” Ozonoff v. Berzak, 744 F.2d 224, 229 (1 st Cir. 1984).  T his court agrees w ith\nPlaintiffs’ position that “standing here does not rest on the TSP’s ‘mere existence, without more.’”\nThe Plaintiffs in this case are not claiming simply that the Defendants’ surveillance has “chilled”\nthem from making international calls to sources and clients.  Rather, they claim that Defendants’\nsurveillance has chilled their sources, clients,  and potential witnesses from communicating with\nthem.  The alleged effect on Plaintiffs is a concrete, actual inability to communicate with witnesses,\nsources, clients and others without great expense  which has significantly crippled Plaintiffs, at a\nminimum, in their ability to report the news and cmo petently and effectively represent their clients.\nSee Presbyterian Church v. United State,s 870 F.2d 518 (1989) (church sfufered substantial decrease\nin attendance and participation of individual congregants as a result of governmental surveillance).\nPlaintiffs have suffered actual concrete injuries  to their abilities to carry out their prof essional\nresponsibilities.  The direct injury and objective chill incurred by Plaintiffs are more than sufficient\nto place this case outside the limitations imposed by Laird. \nThe instant case is more akin to Friends of the Earth, in which the Court granted standing\nto environmental groups who sued a pollut er under the Clean Water Act because environmental\ndamage caused by the defendant had deterred members of the plaintiff organizations from using and\nenjoying certain lands and rivers.  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 181-183.  The Court there held\nthat the affidavits and testim ony presented by plaintiffs were sufficient to establish reasonable\nconcerns about the effects of those discharges and were m ore than “general averm ents” and\n“conclusory allegations.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 183-184.  The court distinguished the\ncase from Lujan, in which the Court had held that no act ual injury had been established where\n20\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 21 of 44 \nplaintiffs merely indicated “‘some day’ intentions to visit endangered species around the world.”\nFriends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 184 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at  564).   The court found that the\naffiants’ conditional statements that they would use the nearby river for recreation if defendant were\nnot discharging pollutants into it was sufficient to establish a concrete injury.  Id. at 184.  \nHere, Plaintiffs are not asserting speculative allegations.  Instead, the declarations asserted\nby Plaintiffs establish that they are suffering a present concrete injury in addition to a chill of their\nFirst Amendment rights.  Plaintiffs would be able to continue using the telephone and email in the\nexecution of their professional responsibilities if  the Defendants were not undisputedly and\nadmittedly conducting warrantless wire taps of conversations.  As in  Friends of the Earth,  this\ndamage to their interest is sufficient to establish a concrete injury.\nNumerous cases have granted standing where the plainti ffs ha ve suffered concrete\nprofession-related injuries comparable to those suffered by Plaintiffs here.  For example, the First\nCircuit conferred standing upon claim ants who challenged an executive order which required\napplicants for employment with the World Health Organization to undergo a “loyalty” check that\nincluded an investigation into the applicant’s asscoiations and activities.  The court there determined\nthat such an investigation would have a chilling effect on what an applicant says or does, a sufifcient\ninjury to confer standing. O  zonoff, 744 F.2d  at 228-229.  Similarly, the District of Columbia Circuit\nCourt of Appeals granted standing to a r eshelver of books at the Library of Congress who was\nsubjected to a full field FBI investigation which included an inquiry into his political beliefs and\nassociations and s ubsequently resulted in his being denied a prom otion or any additional\nemployment opportunities; the court having determ ined that plaintiff had suffered a present\nobjective harm, as well as an objective chill of  his First Am endment rights and not m erely a\n21\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 22 of 44 \npotential subjective chill as in Laird.  Also, the Supreme Court in Presbyterian Church v. United\nStates, granted standing to a church which suffered decreased attendance and participation when the\ngovernment actually entered the church to conduct surveillance.  Presbyterian Church,  870 F.2d\nat 522.   Lastly, in Jabara v. Kelley, 476 F.Supp. 561 (E.D. Mich. 1979), vac’d on other grounds\nsub. nom. Jabara v. Webster , 691 F.2d 272 (6 th Cir. 1982), the court held  that an attorney had\nstanding to sue to enjoin unlawf ul FBI and NSA surveillance which had deterred others f rom\nassociating with him and caused “injury to his reputation and legal business.”  Id. at 568.  \nThese cases constitute ac knowledgment that substantial burdens upon a plaintiff’s\nprofessional activities are an injury sufficient t osupport standing.  Defendants ignore the significant,\nconcrete injuries which Plaintiffs continue to experience from Defendants’ illegal  monitoring of\ntheir telephone conversations and em ail communications.  Plaintiffs undeniably have cited t o\ndistinct, palpable, and substantial injuries that have resulted from the TSP.  \nThis court finds that the injuries alleged by Plaintiffs are “concrete and particularized”, and\nnot “abstract or conjectural.”  The TSP is noth ypothetical, it is an actual surveillance program that\nwas admittedly instituted after September 11, 2001, and has been reauthorized by the President more\nthan thirty times since the attacks.21    The President has, moreover, emphasized that he intends to\ncontinue to reauthorize the TSP indefinitely.22  Further, the court need not speculate upon the kind\nof activity the Plaintiffs want to engage in - they want to engage in conversations with individuals\nabroad without fear that their First Am endment rights are being infringed upon.  Therefore, this\ncourt concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied  the requirement of alleging “actual or threatened\n21Available at http://www.white-house.gov//news/releases/2005/12/20051219-2.html\n22Id.\n22\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 23 of 44 \ninjury” as a result of Defendants’ conduct.  \nIt must now be determined whether Plaintiffs have shown that there is a causal connection\nbetween the injury and the com plained of conduct.   Lujan,  504 U.S. at 560-561.  The causal\nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of is fairly traceable to the challenged\naction of Defendants.  The TSP admittedly targets communications originated or terminated outside\nthe United States where a party to such communication is in the estimation of Defendants, a member\nof al Qaeda, a member of a group affiliated with al Qaeda, or an agent of al Qaeda or its affiliates.23\nThe injury to the Plain tiffs stems directly from the TSP and their injuries can unequivocally be\ntraced to the TSP.\nFinally, it is likely that the injury will be rederssed by the requested relief.  A determination\nby this court that the TSP is unconstitutional anda  further determination which enjoins Defendants\nfrom continued warrantless wiretapping in contravention of FISA would assure Plaintiffs and others\nthat they could freely engage in conversations and correspond via email without concern, at least\nwithout notice, that such communications were being monitored.  The requested relief would thus\nredress the injury to Plaintiffs caused by the TSP.\nAlthough this court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient injury to establish\nstanding, it is important to note that if the court were to deny standing based on the unsubstantiated\nminor distinctions drawn by Defendants, the President’s actions in warrantless wiretapping, in\ncontravention of FISA, Title III, and the First and Fourth Amendments, would be immunized from\njudicial scrutiny.  It was never thein tent of the Framers to give the President such unfettered control,\nparticularly where his actions blatantly disregard the parameters clearly enumerated in the Bill of\n23Available at http://www.white-house.gov//news/releases/2005/12/20051219-2.html\n23\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 24 of 44 \nRights.  The three separate branches of government were developed as a check and balance for one\nanother.   It is within the court’s duty to ensu re that power is never “condense[d] ... into a single\nbranch of government.”  Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (plruality opinion).  We must\nalways be mindful that “[w]hen the President takes official action, the Court has the authority to\ndetermine whether he has acted within the law.”  Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 703 (1997).   “It\nremains one of the m ost vital functions of this  Court to police with care the separation of  the\ngoverning powers . . . . When structure fails, liberty is always in peril.” P ublic Citizen v. U.S.  Dept.\nof Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 468 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\nBecause of the very secrecy of the activity here challenged, Plaintiffs each must be and are\ngiven standing to challenge it, because each of th em, is injured and chilled substantially in the\nexercise of First Am endment rights so long as it continues.  Indeed, as the perceived need for\nsecrecy has apparently required that no person be notified that he is aggrieved by the activity, and\nthere have been no prosecutions, no requests for extnesions or retroactive approvals of warrants, no\nvictim in America would be given standing to challenge this or any other unconstitutional activity,\naccording to the Government.  The activity has been acknowledged, nevertheless.\nPlaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that they suffered an actual, concrete injury traceable to\nDefendants and redressable by this court.  Acco rdingly, this court denies Defendants’ motion to\ndismiss for lack of standing.\nIV.  The History of Electronic Surveillance in America\nSince the Court’s 1967 decision ofK  atz v. U.S., 389 U.S. 347 (1967), it has been understood\nthat the search and seizure of private telephone conversations without physi cal trespass required\n24\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 25 of 44 \nprior judicial sanction, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment.  Justice Stewart there wrote for the Court\nthat searches conducted without prior approval by a judge or magistrate were per se unreasonable,\nunder the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 357.\nCongress then, in 1968, enacted Title III of theO mnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act\n(hereinafter “Title III”)24 governing all wire and electronic interceptions in the fight against certain\nlisted major crimes.  The Statute defined an “ aggrieved person”,25 and gave such person standing\nto challenge any interception allegedly made without a judicial order supported by probable cause,\nafter requiring notice to such person of any interception made.26\nThe statute also stated content requirements for warrants and applications unde roath therefor\nmade,27 including time, name of the target, place to bese arched and proposed duration of that search,\nand provided that upon showing of an emergency situation, a post-interception warrant could be\nobtained within forty-eight hours.28\nIn 1972 the court decided U.S. v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972) (the Keith case)\nand held that, f or lawful electronic surveillance even in dom estic security m atters, the Fourth\nAmendment requires a prior warrant.  \nIn 1976 the Congressional “Church Committee”29 disclosed that every President since 1946\n24Pub.

In the  Keith case, Justice Powell wrote that “Congre ss simply left\nPresidential powers where it found them”, that the disclaimer was totally neutral, and not a grant of\nauthority.  U.S. v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. at 303.\nThe FISA defines a “United States person3”3 to include each of Plaintiffs herein and requires\na prior warrant for any domestic international interception of their communications.  For various\nexigencies, exceptions are made.  That is, the govermn ent is granted fifteen days from Congressional\nDeclaration of War within which it may conduct intercepts before application for an order.34  It is\nalso granted one year, on certification by the Attorney General,35 and seventy-two hours for other\n30S.

Rep. 807 (1765) in m ind”, stated Circuit Judge Skelly W right in\nZweibon v. Mitchell, 516 F.2d 594, 618 n.67 (D.C. Circ. 1975) (enb anc) (plurality opinion).  Justice\nDouglas, in his concurrence in the Keith case, also noted the significance of Entick in our history,\n28\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 29 of 44 \nstating:\nFor it was such excesses as the use of general warrants and the writs\nof assistance that led to the ratiifcation of the Fourth Amendment.  In\nEntick v. Carrington (citation omitted), decided in 1765, one finds a\nstriking parallel to the executive warrants utilized here.  The\nSecretary of State had issued general executive warrants to his\nmessengers authorizing them to roam about and to seiz e libelous\nmaterial and libellants of the sovereign.  Entick, a critic of the Crown,\nwas the victim of one such general search during which his seditious\npublications were im pounded.  He brought a s uccessful damage\naction for trespass against the messengers.  The verdict was sustained\non appeal.  Lord Camden wrote that if such sweepi ng tactics were\nvalidated, then the secret cabinets and bureaus of every subject in this\nkingdom will be thrown ope n to th e search and inspection of a\nmessenger, whenever the secretary of state shall think fit to charge,\nor even to suspect, a person to be the author, printer, or publisher of\na seditious libel.’ (citation om itted) In a related and sim ilar\nproceeding, Huckle v. Money (citation omitted), the same judge who\npresided over Entick’s appeal held for another victim  of the same\ndespotic practice, saying ‘(t)o enter a m an’s house by vir tue of a\nnameless warrant, in order t o procure evidence, is worse than the\nSpanish Inquisition . . .’  See also Wilkes v. Wood (citation omitted),\n. . . [t]he tyrannical invasions  described and assailed in  Entick,\nHuckle, and  Wilkes, practices which also were endured by the\ncolonists, have been recognized as the primary abuses which ensured\nthe Warrant Clause a prominent place in our Bill of Rights.  U.S. v.\nU.S. District Court, 407 U.S. at 328-329 (Douglas, J., concurring).\nJustice Powell, in writing for the court in the Keith case also wrote that:\nOver two centuries ago, Lord Mansfield held that com mon-law\nprinciples prohibited warrants that ordered the arrest of unnam ed\nindividuals who the officer might conclude were guilty of seditious\nlibel.  ‘It is not fit,’ said Mansfield, ‘that the receiving or judging of\nthe information should be left to the discretion of the officer.  The\nmagistrate ought to judge; and should give certain directions to the\nofficer.’  (citation omitted).\nLord Mansfield’s formulation touches the very heart of the Fourth\nAmendment directive: that, where practical, a governmental search\nand seizure should represent both the efforts of the officer to gather\nevidence of wrongful acts and the judgment of the magistrate that the\ncollected evidence is suf ficient to justif y invasion of  a citizen’s\n29\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 30 of 44 \nprivate premises or conversation.  Inherent in the concept of a\nwarrant is its issuance by a ‘neutral and detached m agistrate.’\n(citations omitted)  The f urther requirement of ‘probable cause’\ninstructs the magistrate that baseless searches shall not proceed.U  .S.\nv. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. at 316.\nThe Fourth Amendment, accordingly, was adopted to assure that Executive abuses of the\npower to search would not continue in our new nation.\nJustice White wrote in 1984 inU  nited States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984), a case involving\ninstallation and monitoring of a beeper which had ofund its way into a home, that a private residence\nis a place in which society recognizes an expectation of privacy; that warrantless searches of such\nplaces are presumptively unreasonable, absent exigencies.  Id. at 714-715.  Karo is consistent with\nKatz where Justice Stewart held that: \n‘Over and again this Court has emphasized that the mandate of the\n(Fourth) Am endment requires adherence to judicial processes,’\n(citation omitted) and that searches conducted outside the judicial\nprocess, without prior approval by judge or m agistrate, are per se\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment - subject only to a few\nspecifically established and well-delineated exceptions.  Katz, 389\nU.S. at 357.\nJustice Powell’s opinion in the Keith case also stated that:\nThe Fourth Amendment does not contemplate the executive officers\nof Government as neutral and disinterested magistrates.  Their duty\nand responsibility are  to enforce the laws, to investigate, and to\nprosecute. (citation om itted)  But those charged with this\ninvestigative and prosecutorial duty should not be the sole judges of\nwhen to utilize constitutionally sensitive m eans in pursuing their\ntasks.  The historical judgm ent, which the Fourth Am endment\naccepts, is that unreviewed executive discretion may yield too readily\nto pressures to obtain incriminating evidence and overlook potential\ninvasions of privacy and protected speech.   U.S. v. U.S. District\nCourt, 407 U.S. at 317.\nAccordingly, the Fourth Amendment, about which much has been written, in its few words requires\n30\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 31 of 44 \nreasonableness in all searches.  It also requirse prior warrants for any reasonable search, based upon\nprior-existing probable cause, as well as particularity as to persons, places, and things, and the\ninterposition of a neutral magistrate between Executive branch enforcement officers and citizens.\nIn enacting FISA, Congress made numerous concessions to stated executive needs.  They\ninclude delaying the applications for warrants until after surveillance has begun for several types\nof exigencies, reducing the probable cause requirement to a less stringent standard, provision of a\nsingle court of judicial experts,a nd extension of the duration of approved wiretaps from thirty days\n(under Title III) to a ninety day term.\nAll of the above Congressional concessions to Executive need and to the exigencies of our\npresent situation as a people, however, have been futile.  The wiretapping program here in litigation\nhas undisputedly been continued for at least five years, it has undisputedly been im plemented\nwithout regard to FISA and of course the m ore stringent standards of Title III, and obviously in\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.\nThe President of the United States is himself created by that same Constitution.\nVI.  The First Amendment\nThe First Amendment provides:\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of\nspeech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to\nassemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\nU.S. CONST. Amend. I.\nThis Amendment, the very first which the American people required to be made to the new\nConstitution, was adopted, as was the Fourth, withE ntick v. Carrington,  and the actions of the star\nchamber in mind.  As the Court wrote in Marcus v. Search Warrants, 367 U.S. 717 (1961):\n31\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 32 of 44 \nHistorically the struggle for freedom of speech and press in England\nwas bound up with the issue of the scope of the search and seizure.\n.  . . \n* * * *\nThis history was, of cours e, part of the intellectual m atrix within\nwhich our own constitutional fabric was shaped.  The Bill of Rights\nwas fashioned against the backgorund of knowledge that unrestricted\npower of search and seizure could also be an instrument for stifling\nliberty of expression.  Marcus, 367 U.S. at 724, 729\nAs Justice Brennan wrote for the Court in Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 (1965), the\nappellant organizations had been subjected to rpeeated announcements of their subversiveness which\nfrightened off potential m embers and contributors, and had been harm ed irreparably, requiring\ninjunctive relief.  The Louisiana law against whihc they complained, moreover, had a chilling effect\non protected expression because, so long as the statute was available, the threat of prosecution for\nprotected expression remained real and substantial.\nJudge Wright, in Zweibon, noted that the tapping of an organization’s office phone will\nprovide the membership roster of that organization, as forbidden by B ates v. City of Little Rock, 361\nU.S. 516 (1960); t hereby causing members to leave that organization, and thereby chilling the\norganization’s First Amendment rights and causing the loss of membership.  Zweibon, 516 F.2d  at\n634.\nA governmental action to regulate speech  may be justif ied only upon show ing of a\ncompelling governmental interest; and that the means chosen to further that interest are the least\nrestrictive of freedom of belief and association that could be chosen. C  lark v. Library of Congress,\n750 F.2d 89, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\nIt must be noted that FISA explicitly admonishes that “. . . no United States person may be\n32\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 33 of 44 \nconsidered . . . an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities protected by the First\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States.” 50 U.S.C. §1805(a)(3)(A).  See also United\nStates v. Falvey, 540 F. Supp. at 1310.\nFinally, as Justice Powell wrote for the Court in the Keith case:\nNational security cases, moreover, often reflect a convergence of\nFirst and Fourth Amendment values not present in cases of ‘ordinary’\ncrime.  Though the investigative duty of the executive m ay be\nstronger in such cases, so also is the re gr eater jeopardy to\nconstitutionally protected speech.  ‘Historically the struggle for\nfreedom of speech and press inE  ngland was bound up with the issue\nof the scope of  the search and  seizure power,’ (citation omitted).\nHistory abundantly docum ents the tendency of Governm ent\n–however benevolent and benign its motives – to view with suspicion\nthose who most fervently dispute its policies.  Fourth Am endment\nprotections become the more necessary when the targets of official\nsurveillance may be those suspected of unorthodoxy in their political\nbeliefs.   U.S. v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. at 313-314.\nThe President of the United States, a creature of the same Constitution which gave us these\nAmendments, has undisputedly violated the Fourth in failing to procure judicial orders as required\nby FISA, and accordingly has violated the First Amendment Rights of these Plaintiffs as well.\nVII.  The Separation of Powers\nThe Constitution of the United States provides that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted\nshall be vested in a Congress of the United States. . . .”43  It further provides that “[t]he executive\nPower shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”44  And that “. . . he shall take\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed . . . .”45 \n43U.S. CONST. art. I, § 1\n44U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1\n45U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3\n33\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 34 of 44 \nOur constitution was drafted by founders and  ratified by a people who still held in vivid\nmemory the image of King George III and his General Warrants.  The concept that each form of\ngovernmental power should be separated was a well-developed one.  James Madison wrote that:\nThe accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary,\nin the same hands, whether of one, a few, or m any, and whether\nhereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the\nvery definition of tyranny.  THE FEDERALIST NO. 47, at 301 (James\nMadison).\nThe seminal American case in this area, and one on which the government appears to rely,\nis that of Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) in which Justice Black, for the\ncourt, held t hat t he Presidential order in que stion, to seize steel m ills, was not within the\nconstitutional powers of the chief executive.  Justice Black wrote that:\nThe founders of this Nation entrusted the law-making power to the\nCongress alone in both good and bad times.  It would do no good to\nrecall the historical events, the fears of power and the hopes  for\nfreedom that lay behind their choice.  Such a review would but\nconfirm our hol ding that this seizure order cannot stand.\nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 589.\n Justice Jackson’s concurring opinion in that case has becom e historic.  He wrote that,\nalthough the Constitution had diffused powers the better to secure liberty, the powers of the\nPresident are not fixed, but fluctuate, depending upon their junctures with the actions of Congress.\nThus, if the President acted pursuant to an experss or implied authorization by Congress, his power\nwas at it maximum, or zenith.  If he acted in absence of Congressional action, he was in a zone of\ntwilight reliant upon only his own independent powers.   Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 636-638.  But\n“when the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress,\nhis power is at its lowest ebb, for he can rely only upon his own Constitutional powers minus any\nConstitutional powers of Congress over the m atter.” Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 637 (Jackson, J.,\n34\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 35 of 44 \nconcurring).\nIn that case, he wrote that it had been conceded that no congressional authorization existed\nfor the Presidential seizure.  Indeed, Congress had several tim es covered the area with statutory\nenactments inconsistent with the seizure.  He further wrote of the President’s powers that:\nThe example of such unlimited executive power that must have most\nimpressed the forefathers was the prerogative exercised by George\nIII, and the description of its evilsin  the Declaration of Independence\nleads me to doubt that they were creating their new Executive in his\nimage.  Continental European exam ples were no m ore appealing.\nAnd if we seek instruction from our own times, we can match it only\nfrom the executive powers in those governm ents we disparagingly\ndescribe as totalitarian.  I cannot accept the view that this clause is a\ngrant in bulk of all conceivable executive power but regard it as an\nallocation to the presidential office of the generic powers thereafter\nstated. Id. at 641.  \nAfter analyzing the more recent experienceso f Weimar, Germany, the French Republic, and\nGreat Britain, he wrote that:\nThis contemporary foreign experience may be inconclusive as to the\nwisdom of lodging e mergency powers som ewhere in a m odern\ngovernment.  But it suggests that emergency powers are consistent\nwith free government only when their control is lodged elsewhere\nthan in the Executive who exercisest hem.  That is the safeguard that\nwould be nullified by our adoption of the ‘inherent powers’ formula.\nNothing in my experience convinces me that such risks are warranted\nby any real necessity, although such powers would, of course, be an\nexecutive convenience.  Id. at 652.\nJustice Jackson concluded that:\nWith all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have discovered\nno technique for long preserving free governm ent except that the\nExecutive be under the law, a nd t hat the law be m ade by\nparliamentary deliberations. Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 655 (Jackson,\nJ., concurring).\nAccordingly, Jackson concurred, the President had acted unlawfully.\n35\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 36 of 44 \nIn this case, the President has acted, undisputedly, as FISA forbids.  FISA is the expressed\nstatutory policy of our Congress.  The presidentialp ower, therefore, was exercised at its lowest ebb\nand cannot be sustained.\nIn United States v. Moussaoui , 365 F.3d 292 (4 th Cir. 2004)  a prosecution in which\nproduction of enemy combatant witnesses had been refused by the government and the doctrine of\nSeparation of Powers raised, the court, citing Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), noted\nthat it:\n“[C]onsistently has given voice to, and has reaffirm ed, the central\njudgment of the Framers of the Constitution that, within our political\nscheme, the separation of governmental powers into three coordinate\nBranches is essential to the preservation of liberty.”  United States v.\nMoussaoui, 365 F.3d at 305 citing  Mistretta v. United States, 488\nU.S. 361, 380 (1989)\nFinally, in the case of  Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681 (1997), the sepa ration of powers\ndoctrine is again discussed and, again,  some overlap of the authorities of two branches is permitted.\nIn that case, although Article III  jurisdiction of teh federal courts is found intrusive and burdensome\nto the Chief Executive it did not follow, the court held, that separation of powers principles would\nbe violated by allowing a la wsuit against the Chief Executive to proceed.   Id. at 701.  Mere\nburdensomeness or inconvenience did not rise to the level of superceding the doctrine of separation\nof powers.  Id. at 703.\nIn this case, if the teachings of Youngstown are law, the separation of powers doctrine has\nbeen violated.  The President, undispute dly, has violated the provisions of FISA for a five-year\nperiod.  Justice Black wrote, in Youngstown:\nNor can  th e s eizure o rder b e s ustained because o f th e s everal\nconstitutional provisions that grant executive power to the President.\n36\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 37 of 44 \nIn the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see\nthat the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be\na lawmaker.  The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking\nprocess to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing\nof laws he thinks bad.  And the Constitution is neither silent nor\nequivocal about who make laws which the President is to execute.\nThe first section of the first article says that ‘All legislative powers\nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States *\n* *’\nThe President’s order does not direct that a congressional policy be\nexecuted in a m anner prescribed by Congr ess – it directs that a\npresidential policy be executed in a m anner prescribed by the\nPresident. . . . The Constitution  did not subject this law-m aking\npower of Congress to presidential or military supervision or control.\nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 587-588. \nThese secret authorization orders m ust, like the executive order in that case, fall.  They\nviolate the Separation of Powers ordained by the very Constitution of  which this President is a\ncreature.\nVIII.  The Authorization for Use of Military Force\nAfter the terrorist attack on this Country o Sfeptember 11, 2001, the Congress jointly enacted\nthe Authorization for Use of Military Force (hereinafter “AUMF”) which states:\nThat the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate\nforce against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines\nplanned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that\noccurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or\npersons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism\nagainst the United States by suchn ations, organizations or persons.46\nThe Government argues here that it was given authority by that resolution to conduct the TSP\nin violation of both FISA and the Constitution. \nFirst, this court m ust note that the AUMF says nothing whatsoever of intelli gence or\n46Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub. L. No. 107-40, § 2(a), 115 Stat. 224 (Sept. 18, 2001)\n(reported as a note to 50 U.S.C.A. § 1541)\n37\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 38 of 44 \nsurveillance.  The government argues that such authority must be implied.  Next it must be noted\nthat FISA and Title III, are together by their terms denominated by Congress as the exclusive means\nby which electronic surveillance may be conducted.  Both statutes have made abundantly clear that\nprior warrants must be obtained from the FISA court for such surveillance, with limited exceptions,\nnone of which are here even raised as applicable.  Inde ed, the government here claims that the\nAUMF has by implication granted its TSP authority for m ore than five years, although FISA’s\nlongest exception, for the Declaration of War by Congress, is only fifteen days from date of such\na Declaration.47\nFISA’s history and content, detailed above, areh ighly specific in their requirements, and the\nAUMF, if construed to apply at all to intelligence is utterly general.  In Morales v. TWA, Inc., 504\nU.S. 374 (1992), the Supreme Court taught us that “it is a commonplace of statutory construction\nthat the specific governs the general.” I d. at 384.  The implication argued by Defendants, therefore,\ncannot be made by this court.\nThe case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004) in which the Supreme Court held that\na United States citizen may be held as an enemy combatant, but is required by the U.S. Constitution\nto be given due process of law, must also be examined.  Justice O’Connor wrote for the court that:\n[D]etention of individuals . . . for the duration of t he particular\nconflict in which they are captured is so fundamental and accepted an\nincident to war as to be an execrise of the “necessary and appropriate\nforce” Congress has authorize d the President to use.   Hamdi, 542\nU.S. at 518.\nShe wrote that the entire object of capture is to prevent the captured com batant from\nreturning to his same enemy force, and that a prisoner would most certainly return to those forces\n4750 U.S.C. § 1811\n38\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 39 of 44 \nif set free.  Congress had, therefore, clearl yauthorized detention by the Force Resolution .I d. at 518-\n519.\nHowever, she continued, indefinite detentionf or purposes of interrogation was certainly not\nauthorized and  it raised  the question of  what process is  constitutionally due to a citizen who\ndisputes the enemy combatant status assigned him.  Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 521, 524.\nJustice O’Connor concluded that such a citizen must be given Fifth Amendment rights to\ncontest his classification, including notice and the opport unity to be heard by a neutral\ndecisionmaker.  Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 533 (citing Cleveland Board of Education v. Laudermill, 470\nU.S. 532 (1985)).  Accordingly, her holding was  that the Bill of Right s of the Uni ted States\nConstitution must be applied despite authority granted by the AUMF. \nShe stated that:\nIt is during our m ost challenging and uncertain m oments that our\nNation’s commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it\nis in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to\nthe principles for which we fight abroad. \n* * * *\nAny process in which the Executive’s factual assertions go wholly\nunchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity\nfor the alleged combatant to dem onstrate otherwise f alls\nconstitutionally short.  Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 532, 537.\nUnder Hamdi, accordingly, the Constitution of the United States must be followed.\nThe AUMF resolution, i f indeed it is constr ued as replacing FISA, gives no support to\nDefendants here.  Even i f that Resolution superceded all other statutory law, Defendants have\nviolated the C onstitutional rights of  their c itizens including the F irst A mendment, F ourth\nAmendment, and the Separation of Powers doctrine.\n39\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 40 of 44 \nIX.  Inherent Power\nArticle II of the United States Constitution provides that any citizen of appropriate birth, age\nand residency may be elected to the Office of President of the United States and be vested with the\nexecutive power of this nation.48\nThe duties and powers of the Chief Executive are carefully listed, including the duty to be\nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United Stat es,49 and the Presidential Oath of\nOffice is set forth in the Constitution and requires him to swear or affirm that he “will, to the best\nof my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”50\nThe Government appears to argue here that , pursuant to the penum bra of Constitutional\nlanguage in Article II, and particularly becauset he President is designated Commander in Chief of\nthe Army and Navy, he has been gr anted the inherent power to violate not only the law s of the\nCongress but the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution, itself.  \nWe must first note that the Office of the Ch ief Executive has itself been created, with its\npowers, by the Constitution.  There are no hereditary Kings in America and no powers not created\nby the Constitution.  So all “inherent powers” must derive from that Constitution.\nWe have seen in Hamdi that the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution is fully\napplicable to the Executive branch’s actions and tehrefore it can only follow that the First and Fourth\nAmendments must be applicable as well.51  In the Youngstown case the same “inherent powers”\nargument was raised and the Court noted that the President had been created Commander in Chief\n48U.S. CONST. art.

Blaisdell, we were taught that no emergency can create\npower.53\nFinally, although the Defendants have suggested the unconstitutionality of FISA, it appears\nto this court that that question is here irrelevnat.  Not only FISA, but the Constitution itsel fhas been\nviolated by the Executive’s TSP.  As the court states inF  alvey, even where statutes are not explicit,\nthe requirements of the Fourth Amendment must still be met.54  And of course, theZ weibon opinion\nof Judge Skelly Wright plainly states that although many cases hold that the President’s power to\nobtain foreign intelligence information is vast, none suggest that he is immune from Constitutional\nrequirements.55\nThe argument that inherent powers justify the program here in litigation must fail.\nX.  Practical Justifications for Exemption\nFirst, it must be remembered that both Title III and FISA permit delayed applications for\nwarrants, after surveillance has begun.  Also,  the case law has long perm itted law enforcement\naction to proceed in cases in which the lives of o fficers or others are threatened in cases of “hot\npursuit”, border searches, school locke r searches, or where em ergency situations exist.

Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990). \nIndeed, in Zweibon, Judge Wright enumerates a number of Defendants’ practical arguments\nhere (including judicial c ompetence, danger of security leaks, less likelihood of crim inal\nprosecution, delay, and the burden placed upon bot h the courts and the Executive branch by\ncompliance) and finds, after long and careful analysis, that none constitutes adequate justification\nfor exemption from the requirements of either FISA or the Fourth Amendment.

It is noteworthy, in this regard, that Defendants here ha ve sought no Congressional\namendments which would remedy practical difficulty.\nAs long ago as theY oungstown case, the Truman administration argued that the cumbersome\nprocedures required to obtain warrants made the process unworkable5.6  The Youngstown court made\nshort shift of that argument and, it appears, the present Defendants’ need for speed and agility is\nequally weightless.  The Supreme Court in the Keith57, as well as the Hamdi58 cases, has attempted\nto offer helpful solutions to the delay problem, all to no avail. \nXI.  Conclusion\nFor all of the reasons outlined above, this court  icsonstrained to grant to Plaintiffs the Partial\nSummary Judgment requested, and holds that the TSP violates the APA; the Separation of Powers\ndoctrine; the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution; and the statutory law.\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss the final claim of data-mining is granted, because litigation\nof that claim would require violation of Defendants’ state secrets privilege.\n56See generally Youngstown, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) \n57See generally U.S. v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972) \n58See generally Hamdi, 542 U.S. 507 (2004) \n42\n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 70     Filed 08/17/2006     Page 43 of 44 \nThe Permanent Injunction of the TSP requestedb y Plaintiffs is granted inasmuch as each of\nthe factors required to be m et to sustain such an injunction have undisputedly been m et.59  The\nirreparable injury necessary to warrant injunctive relie fis clear, as the First and Fourth Amendment\nrights of Plaintiffs are violated by the TSP.  See Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479 (1965).  The\nirreparable injury conversely sustained by Defendants under this injunction m ay be rectified by\ncompliance with our Constitution and/or statutory law, as amended if necessary.  Plaintiffs have\nprevailed, and the public interest is clear, in this matter.  It is the upholding of our Constitution.\nAs Justice Warren wrote in U.S. v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967):\nImplicit in the term  ‘national defense’ is the notion of  defending\nthose values and ide as which set this Nation apart. . . . It would\nindeed be ironic if, in the nam e of na tional defense, we would\nsanction the subversion of . . . those liberties . . . which m akes the\ndefense of the Nation worthwhile.

Further, “[a] party is entitled to a permanent injunction if it can\nestablish that it suffered a constitutional violation and will suffer “continuing irreparable injury” for which there is\nno adequate remedy at law.”  Women's Medical Professional Corp. v.

STEINBERG \nKARYL MOSS \nAmerican Civil Liberties Uni011 Fund of Michigan \n60 West Hancock Street \nDetroit, MI 48201-1343 \n(313) 578-6814 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 2 of 50 \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of a secret government \nprogram to intercept vast quantities of the international telephone and Internet \ncommunications of innocent Americans without court approval (hereinafter \"the \nProgram\").  The National Security Agency I Central Security Service (\"NSA\") launched \nthe Program in 2001 and t11e President of!he United States ratified it in 2002. \n2.  Plaintiffs are a group of prominent journalists, scholars, attorneys, and \nnational nonprofit organizations who frequently communicate by telephone and email \nwith people outside the United States, including in the Middle Bast and Asia.  Because of \nthe nature of their calls and emails, and the identities and locations of those with whom \nthey commimicate, plaintiffs have a well-founded belief that their communications are \nbeing intercepted under the Program.  The Program is disrnpting the ability of the \nplaintiffs to talk with sources, locate witnesses, conduct scholarship, and engage in \nadvocacy. \n3.  By seriously compromising the free speech and privacy rights of the \nplaintiffs and others, the Program violates the First and Fourth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution.  It also violates constitutional separation of powers principles, \nbecause it was authori,-.ed by President George W. Bush in excess of his Executive \nauthority and contrary to limits imposed by Congress.  ln response to widespread \ndomestic surveillance abuses committed by the Executive Branch and exposed in the \n1960s and 1970s, Congress enacted legislation that provides \"the exclusive means by \nwhich electronic surveillance ... and !he interception of domestic wire, oral, and \nelectronic communications may be conducted.\"  18 U.S.C. ~ 2511 (2)( l) (emphasis \n2 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 3 of 50 \nadded),  Plaintiffs respectfully seek a declaration that the Program is unlawful, and a \npermanent injunction against its use. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This case arises under the United States Constitution and the laws orthe \nU11ited States and presents a federal question within this Cou11's jurisdiction un.der \nAlticle III of the United States C011stitution and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

Through \nTitle TTI, Congress created a statutory framework to govern !he surveillance of wire and \noral communications in law enforcement investigations. \n6 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 7 of 50 \n23.  Tn its current form, Title Ill authmizes the government to intercept wire, \noral, or electronic communications in investigations of certain enumerated criminal \noffenses, see 18 U.S.C. § 2516, with prior judicial approval, see id.§ 2518.  ln order to \nobtain a court order authorizing the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic \ncommunication, the government must demonstrate \"probable cause for bclicflhat an \nindividllal is committing, has commi!!ed, or is abollt to commit\" one of the enumerated \ncriminal offenses.  Id. § 2518(3 )(a).  It must also demonstrate, among other things, \n\"probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning [!he enumerated] \noffense will be obtained through [the] interception,\" id.§ 2518(3)(b), and that \"non11al \ninvestigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be \nunlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous,\" id.§ 2518(3)(c). \n24.  Every court order authori>:ing surveillance under Title III must include a \nprovision requiring that the interception be \"conducted in a such a way as to minimize the \ninterception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter.\" \nId. § 2518(5). \n25.  While Title Ill generally pennits surveillance only with prior judicial \nauthorization, the statute includes a provision that allows for warrantlcss surveillance in \n\"emergency situation[ s]\" - where, for example, a \"situation exists that involves ... \nimmediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person.\" id. fl 2518(7)(a). \nWhere an emergency situation exists and \"there arc grounds upon which an order could \nbe entered ... to authmi'!:e ... interception,\" the statute pe1mits specified executive \nofficials to authori:1,e wanantlcss surveillance \"if an application for an order approving \n7 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 8 of 50 \nthe interception is made in accordance with this section within forty-eight hours after the \ninterception has occurred, or begins to occur.\"  ld. § 2518(7)(b ). \n26.  Title III specifies civil and criminal penalties for survcilla:nce that is not \nauthorized.  See id. §§ 2511 & 2520. \n27.  As originally enacted, Title llT provided that \"[n]othing contained in \nthis chapter. , . shall limit the constitutional power of the President to take such measures \nas he deems necessary to pmlect the Nation against actual or potential attack or other \nhostile acts of a foreign power, to obtain foreign intelligence i11fom1ation deemed \nessential to the security of the United States, or to protect national security information \nagainst foreign intelligence activities.  Nor shall anything contained in this chapter be \ndeemed to limit the constitulional power ofthc President to take such measures as he \ndeems necessary to protect the United States against the overthrow of the Government by \nforce or other unlawful means, or against any other clear and present danger to the \nstructure or existence of the Government.\"  See 18. U.S.C. § 2511(3) (1976).  As \ndiscussed below, Congress repealed this provision in 1978. \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n28.  In 1978, Congress enacted FISA to govern the use of electronic \nsurveillance against foreign powers and their agents inside the United States.  The statute \ncreated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a court composed of seven (now \neleven) federal district court judges, and empowered this court to grant or deny \ngovGmment applications for electronic surveillance orders in foreign intelligence \ninvestigations.  See 50 U.S.C. § I 803(a). \n8 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 9 of 50 \n29.  Congress enacted FTSA after the U.S. Supreme Court held, in United \nStales v.  United States District Court.for the Eastern Districl of Michigan. 407 U.S. 297 \n( 1972), that the Fouith Amendment does not permit warra.ntlcss surveillance in \nintelligence investigations of domestic Hecurity threats.  FISA was a response to that \ndecision and to the Report of the Senate Select Committee to Study Government \nOperations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, S.Rep. No. 94-755, 94th Cong., 2d \nSess. (1976) (\"Church Committee Report\"), which found that the executive had engaged \nin warranlless wiretapping of numerous United States citizens - including journalists, \nactivists, and Congressmen  who posed no threat to the nation's security and who were \nnot suspected of any criminal offense.  The Church Committee Report warned that \n\"[ u ]nless new and tighter controls arc established by legislation, domestic intelligence \nactivities threaten to undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its \nnature.\" \n30.  When Congress enacted FISA, it amended Title Ill to provide that the \nprocedures set out therein and in FlSA \"shall be the exclusive means by which electronic \nsurveillance ... and the interception of domesti.c wire, oral, and electronic \ncommunications may be conducted.\"  18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(f) (emphasis added).  FISA \nprovides that no one may engage in electronic surveillance \"except as authorized by \nstatute,\" id.§ 1809(a)(l), and it specifics civil and criminal penalties for electronic \nsurveillance undertaken without statutory authority, see id. §§ 1809 & 1810.  The Senate \nJudiciary Committee explained that \"[t]he basis for this legislation is the understanding \nconcun-ed in by the At!on1ey General - that even if the President has an 'inherent' \nConstitutional power to authorize warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence \n9 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 10 of 50 \npurposes, Congress has the power to regulate the exercise of this authority by legislating \na reasonable warrant procedure goveniing foreign intelligence surveillance.\"  S. Rep. 95-\n604(1), reprinted at 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3917.  The Committee further explained that \nthe legislation was meant lo ··spell out that lhe executive cannot engage in electronic \nsurveillance within the United States without a prior Judicial warrant.\" Td. at 3906. \n31.  FISA defines \"electronic surveillance\" broadly to include: \na.  \"the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance \ndevice of the contents of any wire or radio communication sent by or \nintended to be received by a particular, known United States person \nwho is in the United States, if the contents are acquired by \nintentionally targeting that United States person, under circumstances \nin which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a \nwarrant would be required for law enforcement purposes\"; \nb.  \"lhe acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance \ndevice of the contents of any wire communication to or from a person \nin the United Slates, without the consent of any party thereto, if such \nacquisition occurs in the United States ... \"; \nc.  \"the intentional acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other \nsurveillance device of the contents of any radio communication, under \ncircumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy and a wammt would be required for law enforcement \npurposes, and if both the sender and all intended recipients arc located \nwithin the United States\"; and \n10 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 11 of 50 \n<l.  \"the installation or use of an electronic, mechanical, or other \nsurveillance device in the United Slates for monitoring to acquire \ninfonnati(ln, other than from a wire or radio communication, under \ncircumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy and a wan-ant would be required for Jaw enforcement \npurposes.\"  SO U.S.C. § I 801(±). \n32.  FlSJ\\ defines \"contents\" lo include \"any infonnation concerning the \nidentity or the parties lo such communication or the existence, substance, purport, or \nmeaning of that communication.\"  50 U.S.C. § 180!(n).  Tt defines \"United Stales person\" \nto include United States citizens and lawful pennanenl residents.  Id. § 1801 (d). \n33.  In order to obtain an order from lhe FISA Comt authorizing clcc!ronic \nsurveillance, the government must demonstrate, among other things, probable cause lo \nbelieve that \"the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a \nforeign power\" and that \"each or lhe facilities or places at which lhe electronic \nsurveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an \nagent ofa foreign power.\"  Id.§ 1805(a)(3). \n34.  While FISA generally prohibits surveillance without prior judicial \nauthorization, it, like Tille Ill, includes a provision that aJlows for warrantless \nsurveillance in \"emergency situation[s].\"  ld. § 1805(£).  Where an emergency situation \nexists and \"!he factual basis for issuance of an order under this subchapler to approve \nsuch surveillance exists,\" the statute pcm1its the AUomcy General to authorize \nwarrantless surveillance \"if a judge having j urisdicticm under section 1803 of this ti lie is \ninfonned by the At torncy General or his designee at the time of such authorization that \nl 1 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 12 of 50 \nthe decision has been made lo employ emergency electronic surveillance and if an \napplication in accordance with this subchapter is made to that judge as soon as \npracticable, but not more than 72 hours after the Attorney General authorizes such \nsurveillance-\" id. \n35.  FTSA also allows the Attorney General to authorize electronic \nsurveillance without a court order for up to one year if the Attomey General certifies in \nw1iting under oath that the electronic surveillance is directed solely at the property or \nmeans of communication used exclusively by a foreign power, that \"there is no \nsubstantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire !he contents of any \ncommunication to which a United States person is a party,\" and that there are \nminimization procedures in place.  Id. § 1802. \n36.  Finally, FISA permits electronic surveillance without a court order for \nfifteen days after a formal declaration of war.  Id.§ 1811  (\"Notwithstanding any other \nlaw, the President, through the Atton1ey General, may allthorize electronic surveillance \nwithout a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for \na period not to exceed fifteen calendar days following a declaration of war hy the \n(,, ongress. \") . \n37.  FISA requires the Attorney General to report to the House and Senate \nIntelligence Committees twice a year regarding \"all electronic surveillance\" authorized \nunder FISA.  Id. § l 808(a).  Statistics released annually by the Justice Department \nindicate that, between 1978 and 2004, the government submitted almost 19,000 \nsurveillance applications to the FISA Court.  The FISC denied four of these applications; \n12 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 13 of 50 \ngranted approximately 180 applications with modifications; and granted !he remainder \nwithout modifications. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Pi·ogram \n38.  According to published news reports, in the fall of2001 the NSA \nlaunched a secret surveillance program (\"the Program\") to intercept, without prior \njudicial authorization, the telephone and In!en;et communications of people inside the \nUnited States.  President Bush ratified the Program in 2002.  Since !hen, the President has \nreauthorized the Program more than 30 times. \n39.  Under the Program, the NSA engages in \"electronic surveillance\" as \ndefined by FISA and Title III. \n40.  Under the Program, the NSA intercepts vast quantities of the \ninternational telephone and Internet communications (hereinafter collectively \n\"communications\") of people inside the United States, including citizens and lawfol \npermanent residents. \n41.  Under the Program, the NSA also intercepts some purely domestic \ncommunications, that is, communications among people all of whom are inside !he \nUnited States. \n42.  Under the Program, the NSA intercepts the communications of people \ninside the United States without probable cause to believe that the surveillance targets \nhave committed or are about to commit any crime. \n13 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 14 of 50 \n43.  Under the Program, the NSA intercepts the cornmunications of people \ninside the United Stales without probable cause lo believe that the surveillance targets arc \nforeign powers or agents thereof. \n44.  Under the Program, the NSA intercepts the communications of people \ninside !he United States without obtaining authorization fbr each interception frorn the \nPresident or the Attorney General. \n45.  Under the Program, NSA shift supervisors arc authorized to approve \nNSA employees' requests to intercept the communications of people inside the United \nStates. \n46.  Under the Program, the NSA accesses communications in at least three \nways. \n47.  First, the NSA uses NSA-controlled satellite dishes to access \ncommunications that are transmitted via satellite.  Some of these NSA-controlled satellite \ndishes are located within the United States. \n48.  Second, !he NSA works with tclccmnmunications companies to access \ncommunications that pass through switches controlled by these companies.  These \nswitches, which are located inside the United States, serve as primary gateways for \ncommunications going into and out of the United States.  The switches connect to trans \noceanic fiber optic cables that transmit communications to other countries. \n49.  Third, the NSA works with Tnternet providers and lelecommllnications \ncompanies to access comrnunications transmitted over the Internet. \n50.  Under the Program, the NSA intercepts, retains, and analyzes \ncommunications in at least three ways. \n14 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 15 of 50 \n51.  First, the NSA obtains names, telephone numbers and Internet addresses \nfrom the cell phones, computers, and other infonnation found in the possession of \npersons deemed suspicious.  The NSA intercepts the telephone numbers and Internet \naddresses associated with these people, as well as numbers and emails associated with \nanyone who communicates with them, and continues to identify additional telephone \nnumbers and Internet addresses in an expanding network of people with fewer and fewer \nlinks to the original suspect.  Through this method, the NSA intercepts the contents of the \ncommunications of as many as a thousand people inside the United States at any one \ntime. \n52.  Second, the NSA intercepts communications to and from particular \ncounhies, including Iraq and Afghanistan.  The intercepted communications include calls \nand emails between people inside the tlnited States and people in those other countries. \n53.  Third, the NSA engages in wholesale datamining of domestic and \ninternational communications.  It uses artificial intelligence aids to search for keywords \nand analyze patterns in millions of communications at any given time.  One purpose of \nthis datamining is to identify individuals for targeted sttrveillance. \n54.  Under the Program, the NSA docs not obtain judicial review before or \nafter intercepting the communications of people inside the United States. \n55.  The NSA has submitted information obtained through the Program to \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to support applications for \nsurveillance orders under FISA. \n15 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 16 of 50 \nPlai11tiffs' Allegatio11s \n56.  Plaintiffs and their staff and members (hereinafter \"plaintiffs\") routinely \ncommunicate by email and telephone with people outside the United States, including \npeople in the Middle East and Asia. \n57.  Some of!he plaintiffs, in connection with scholarship, journalism, or \nlegal representation, communicate with people whom the United States government \nbelieves or believed to be !enorist suspects or to be associated with terrorist \norganizations. \n58.  Plaintiffs communicate about subjects that are likely to t1igger scrutiny \nby the NSA under the Program. \n59.  Some of the plaintiffa conduct research on the Internet concerning \ntopics that are likely to trigger semtiny under the Program. \n60.  Because of the nature of plaintiffs' communications and the identities \nand locations ofthose with whom they communicate, plaintiffa have a well-founded \nbelief that their domestic and international communications are heing intercepted by the \nNSA under lhe Program. \n61.  The Program is substantially impairing plaintiffs' ability lo obtain \ninfornrnlion from sources abroad, lo locate wihwsses, to represent their clients, lo conduct \nscholarship, and to engage in advocacy. \n62.  The Program is inhibiting the lawful, constitutionally protected \ncn111munications ofplaintiffa and others not before the Court. \n16 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 17 of 50 \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union !lnd American Civil Liberties Union Foundation \n63.  The ACLU is a 501(c)(4) non-profit, non-partisan organization that \nengages in public education and lobbying about the constitutional principles of libe11Y \nand equality.  The ACLU has more than 500,000 members.  The ACLU's activities \ninclude lobbying Congress on legislation that affects civil liberties, analyzing and \neducating the public about such legislation, and mobilizing ACLU members and activists \nto lobby their legislators t(l protect ci vii rights and civil liberties. \n64,  The ACLUF is a 501(c)(3) organization that educates the public about \ncivil liberties and that cmplClys lawyers who provide legal representation free of charge in \ncases involving civil liberties. \n65.  Since September 11, a core priority of the ACLU and the ACLUl' has \nbeen to publicize and oppose violations of civil liberties effected in the name of national \nsecu1ity.  This work frequently requires ACLU and ACLUF staff and members to \ncommunicate by email and telephone with people and organizations outside the United \nStates.  The international communications of ACLU and ACLUF Slaff and members \nconcern a range of subjects that are likely to trigger sc111tiny under the Prngra111. \n66.  For exan1plo, in November and December 2002, ACLU staff traveled to \nPakistan to interview men whom the Immigration and Naturalization Service had arrested \nand held after the terrorist attacks of S<.'Jllember 2001  as \"special interest\" detainees but \nsubsequently deported without having been charged with any terrorism related offense. \nIn preparation for this trip, ACLU staff communicated by telephone and email with \npeople and organizations in Pakistan and India.  For example, Marsha Zecsman, the \nACLU's Director of Campaigns and Special Projects, and Emily Whitfield, the ACLU's \n17 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 18 of 50 \nMedia Relations Director, communicated by telephone and email on multiple occasions \nwith staff of the lluman Rights Commission of Pakistan, an organization based in \nKarachi.  Whitfield also communicated hy ~mail with Ash-har Quraishi, Cahle News \nNetwork's correspondent in Pakistan; with Carlo!la Gall, a New York Times \ncorrespondent in Pakistan; and with David Rohde, a New York Times correspondent in \nIndia.  Some of the communications of ACLU staff concerned individuals whom the \nJustice Department's website describes as \"linked to the September I l th investigation.\" \n67.  In Ja11uary 2004, the ACLUF filed a petition with lhe United Nations \nWorking Group on Arbitrary Detention on bchal f of some of the men whom the INS had \nheld as \"special interest\" detainees.  The drafting of the petition required ACLUF \nattorney Omar Jadwat and other ACLUF employees to communicate by telephone and \nemail with former detainees living in Pakistan, Egypt, and Jordan. \n68.  Since March 2005, ACLUF attorneys and staff have been investigating \ninstances in which the CIA has transferred  \"rendered\"  foreign nationals to detention \nand interrogation in facilities operated by the CTA outside U.S sovereign territory and to \ncountries and intelligence services that are known to employ torture and other forms of \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  In co1mcction with this research, ACLUF \nattorneys and human rights advisors have communicated by telephone and email with \nindividuals whom the ClA has alleged are associated with terrorist organizations. \nACLUF attorneys and staff have also communicated by telephone and email with \nattorneys representing these individuals. \n69.  ACLUF attorneys currently represent Kha.led El-Masri, a German \ncitizen residing in Neu-Ulm, Gcmmny, whom the CTA rendered to a CIA-nm prison in \n18 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 19 of 50 \nAfghanistan in January 2004.  ACLUF human rights advisor Steven Wall regularly \ncommunicates by telephone and email with Mr. El-Masri and with Mr. El-Masri's \nGem1an attorney, Manfred Gnjidic.  In addition, as part of the ACLU's research into the \nextraordinary rendition program, Mr. Watt regularly communicates by telephone with \nattorneys based in Sweden and Egypt representing Ahmed Agiza and Mohammed Alzery, \nwhom the ClA rendered from Sweden to Egyptian custody in December 2001, and with \nthe Italian attorney representing Abu Omar, whom the CIA rendered from Ttaly to \nEgyptian custody in February 2003. \n70.  ACLUF attorneys also currently represent a number of individuals who \nwere detained and abused by United States forces at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and at \nother detention facilities in Traq and Afghanistan.  ACLUF attorney Omar Jadwat and \nACLUF human rights advisor Jamil Dakwar regularly communicate by telephone and \nemail with individuals in Iraq and Afghanistan, including plaintiffs in the litigation, \nconcerning the treatment of prisoners held by United States forces in those countries. \nSome of these communications concern individuals who remain in the custody of United \nSlates forces. \n71.  Because of the content of their communications and lhe identities and \nlocations of individuals with whom they are communicating, ACLU and ACLUF staff \nhave a well.founded belief that their communications are being intercepted by the NSA \nunder the Program. \n72.  The Program substantially impairs the ability of the ACLU and ACLUF \nto engage in communication that is vital to their respective missions.  The Program \nrequires ACLU and ACLUF staff and members to minimize the sensitive inforniation \n19 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 20 of 50 \nthey include in their communications because of the risk that such information will be \nintercepted.  In addition, ACLU and ACLUF staff and members believe that individuals \nabroad are more reticent in communicating with them because of the possibility that their \ncommunications are being intercepted by the NSA under the Program. \n73.  Attorneys at the ACLUF have represented to many of their clients that \ntheir telephone and email communications with ACLUF attorneys are confidential and \ncovered by the attorney-client privilege.  The willingness of ACLUF clients lo consult \nwith ACLUF attorneys and to provide information to ACLUF attorneys is based in part \non that assurance.  The Program is inhibiting candid communication between ACLUF \nattorneys and their clients and is thereby compromising the ability of ACLUF attorneys \nto effectively represent their clients. \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of IVHchigan \n74.  The ACLU of Michigan is the Michigan affiliate of the ACLU and is \ndedicated to ddending the civil liberties ofMicl1igan residents.  Its activities include \nlobbying the Michigan legislature on proposed bills that affect civil liberties, educating \nthe Michigan public about such legislation and mobilizing ACLU of Michigan members \nand activists to lobby their representatives to protect civil rights and civil liberties. \n75.  Since September 11, 200 I, a core priority of the ACLU of Michigan has \nbeen to publicize and oppose violations of civil liberties affected in the name of national \nsecurity.  For exan1plc, the Michigan ACT ,lJ established a \"Safe and Free Project\" \ndevoted to post·9/I I civil liberties issues and hired a staff attorney for the project.  It \nopposed state legislation that it believed tumecessarily sacrificed civil liberties in the \nname of national security.  Tt mobilized its members to lobby local government bodies \n20 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 21 of 50 \nacross the state, resulting in the enactment of sixteen local resolutions opposing \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act that pose the most serious threats to civil liberties. \nThe manner in which post·9/J I measures impact Arab-Americans is especially important \nto the Michigan ACLU affiliate because sout11east Michigan has the highest \nconcentration of Arab-Americans in the country. \n76.  The ACLU of Michigan has many members who regularly \ncommunicate with people outside the U11ited States, including in the Middle East and \nAsia.  Because oftlw nature of these communications, the identities of the individuals \nwith whom they cmnnmnicate, and the locations of individuals with whom they \ncommunicate, ACLU of Michigan members have a well-founded belief that their \ncommunications are being intercepted by the NSA under the Program.  The Program is \ninhibiting ACLU of Michigan members from communicating freely and candidly in their \npersonal and professional communications. \nNoel Saleh \n77.  Noel Saleh is a member of the ACLU of Michigan who resides in \nWayne County, Michigan.  He is a United States citize11. Jle is a licensed altomey in the \nState of Michigan and served as !he staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union \nofMichiga11's \"Safe and Free Project\" from 2002 to 2004. \n78.  Mr. Saleh has been a community activist for Arab causes both in the \nUnited States and in the Arab World.  Since 1989 he has served on the board of \nACCESS, the Arab Cornmunity Center for Economic and Social Services.  Cum\"ntly, he \nis the Chair of the ACCESS Board of Directors.  As part of his role as an ACCESS Board \nmen1ber, Mr. Saleh is frequently called upon to comment on ernTent affairs and events \n21 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 22 of 50 \naffecting the Arab American community. \n79.  Mr. Saleh has friends and family in Lebanon, Jordan and the Occupied \nPalestinian Territories with whom he frequently communicates by phone and by email. \nPrior to becoming aware of the Program, Mr. Saleh communicated with family members \nabout various political topics and their opinions on current events including Israeli \nrepression of Palestinians under occupation, Palestinian Right of Return and statehood, \nIslamic fundamentalists, terrorism, Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, mid America's role in \neach of these areas. \n80.  Bccau~e of his frequent communications with numerous people in the \nMiddle East and other foreign countries about topics likely to trigger monitoring, Mr. \nSaleh has a well-founded belief that his communications m·e currently being intercepted \nby the NSA under the Program. \n81.  The likelihood U1at his communications are being intercepted by the \nNSA under the Proe,'l'am impinges on Mr. Saleh's ability to communicate freely and \ncandidly in his intemational calls and emails.  Since learning of the Program in news \nrepmis, he has refrained from talking about or emailing friends and family abroad about \ntopics that might trigger monitoring. \n82.  The Program also interferes with Mr. Sal.eh's efforts to promote peace \nand justice in this country.  Before he became awm·e of the Program, he felt free to \nengage in free and open communication with people in other countries about critical \nissues of the day.  He gained unique insight from these conver~alions into U.S. foreign \npolicy that he could not gain from the media in this country.  Because of the NSA \nProgram, he is less willing lo engage in substantive discussions with people abroad and \n22 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 23 of 50 \ntherefore is not able to either gain these unique insights or share them with others. \nMohammed Ahdrabboh \n83.  Mohammed Abdrabboh is a member of the ACLU of Michigan and has \nbeen a member of the ACLU of Michigan's Board of Directors since 2002.  He is a \nUnited States citizen and a licensed attorney in the State of Michigan, with a practice in \nimmigration, criminal defense and civil rights law, in Wayne County, M.ichigan.  Mr. \nAbdrabboh serves as a Commissioner on the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, to \nwhich he was appointed by the Governor in May 2003.  Mr. Ahrabboh also teaches a \ncourse on civil liberties and national security at the University of Michigan at Dearborn. \n84.  Mr. Abdrabboh frequently communicates by telephone and email with \nfamily in the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem.  After law school, Mr. Ahdrabboh worked \nfor Al Haq, a human rights organization in the West Bank.  He frequently communicates \nwith fiiends and acquaintances he met while working there.  He also communicates a \nnumber of times per month by telephone and email with fiiends and acq t1aintanccs in \nSaudi Arabia. \n85.  Approximately ninety-percent of Mr. Abdrabboh's clien!ele come l'rom \ncountries in the Middle East.  As part of his immigration practice, he regularly represents \nindividuals who live in the Middle East and are seeking lo enter the United States, and as \npart of his representation he must conduct all communications with them through \ntelephone and email.  The nature of Mr. Abdrabhoh's law practice requires him to \ncommunicate regularly by telephone and email with people in Lebanon, the West Bank \nand Gaza.  His practice also requires that he occasionally communicate with individuals \nby telephone and email in Jordan, Afghanistan and Yemen.  These communications arc \n23 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 24 of 50 \nessential in providing effective representation to his clients. \n86.  As part of his criminal defense practice, Mr. Abdrabboh has represented \nand continues to represent people the government has suspected of allegedly having some \nlink to ten-oiism or tetTorist organizations. \n87.  Because of the nature of his communications, the identities and \nlocations of people with whom he communicates, Mr. Abdrabboh has a well-founded \nbelief that his t.ommunications are being intercepted by the NSA under the Program. \n88.  The Program has inhibited communications between Mr. Abdrabboh \nand his family mid friends because he is less candid about his political views and avoids \nsaying things that are critical of the U.S. government over the telephone or through email. \n89.  The Program has inhibited communications between Mr. Abdrabboh \nand his clients, both foreign and domestic. .  Since learning of the Program, Mr. \nAbdrabboh has limited his communications about sensitive or privileged matters over the \ntelephone or by email for fem· the government is monitoring the communication.  Instead, \nhe has tried to limit such communications to in-person meetings, which has greatly \nimpaired his ability to quickly get information he needs for the purpose of representing \nclients.  Mr. Adbrabboh also believes that some of his clients have now stopped giving \nhim sensitive infonnation over the telephone.  In one instance, a client who now lives in \nAfghanistan refused to share information over the telephone with Mr. Adbrabboh that \nwas necessary to his representation in an immigration matter because the client feared the \n.c ommunication was being monitored by the gove111rnent \nNabih Ayad \n90.  Nabih Ayad is a member of the ACLU of Michigan.  He is a licensed \n24 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 25 of 50 \nattorney whose practice includes immigration, criminal defense and civil rights cases, in \nWayne County, Michigan.  Since 2002, he has served on the Lawyers Committee of the \nACLU of Michigan, a committee that makes recommendations to the Board of Directors \nabout which cases to pursue. \n91.  In his immigration practice, Mr. Ayad represents individuals throughout \nthe Middle East and South Asia including individuals  Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, \nfr()J11 \nEgypt, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia.  The govcmment has \nattempted to deport some of his clients because of suspected ties to terrorism.  For \nexample, the government suspected some of his clients of supporting, or having ties to, \nthe military wing of Hez.bollah, a group !hat has been designated a terrorist organization \nby the Department of State.  Mr. Ayad has also represented individuals from Lebanon, \nLiberia, and Trinidad who seek political asylum in this country.  He successfully \nprevented 130 immigrants from Leb;mon and Yemen accused of visa fraud from being \ndeported through an expedited removal process.  In the course of his immigration \npractice, Mr. Ayad is required to communicate by phone or through email with clients, \nclients' families and associates, and witnesses in the countries mentioned above. \n92.  . Mr. Ayad has represented criminal defendants from Middle Eastern \ncount1ies who have been accused of terrorism-related crimes.  For example, he \nrepresented one individual from Jordan with suspected ties to the Taliban who came into \nthis country with $12 million of counterfoil checks.  Ile represented a man for Yemen \nwho case was dismissed at the preliminary examination afler he was wrongfi.tlly accused \nof attempting to blow up a federal building in Detrnit.  He also represented individuals \nfrom Lebanon who were accused of smuggling weapons oversees to Hezbollah.  Through \n25 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 26 of 50 \n!he course of his criminal defense work, it is necessary to prepare a defense by \ncommunicating with clients, clients' families, witnesses and others in the client's home \ncountries. \n93.  Mr. Ayad is a naturalized U.S. Citiz.en who was born in Lebanon.  He \nhas family and friends in Lebanon and Germany with whom he communicates by phone \nand email.  When speaking with friends and family in tl1e past, he discussed current \nevents in the Middle East including the war in Iraq and terrorism. \n94.  Because ofthc nature of his communications, the identities of the some \nof the people with whom he communicates and the subject matter of conversations, Mr. \nAyad has a well-founded belief that his communications are being intercepted by the \nNSA under the Program. \n95.  The Program has already inhibited communications between Mr. Ayad \nand individuals in the Middle East and Asia that arc necessary to provide effective legal \nrepresentation to his clients.  Because of the Program, Mr. Ayad will not have certain \nkinds of conversations hy phone or email for fear tliat the goven:unent might he \nmonitoring his communicati.ons.  For example, he will no longer communicate by phone \nor email about important strategic matters and about certain evidence in !enorist-relatcd \nirrnnigration or criminal cases.  In addition, because of the program Mr. Ayad will even \navoid discussing c.ertain political topics with family and friends abroad for foar that such \nconversations will trigger monitoring. \nCouncil on American-Islamic Relations \n96.  Plaintiff CAIR is a non-profit and non-partisan grassroots organiza!im1 \ndedicated to enhancing the general public's understanding of Islam, protecting civil \n26 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 27 of 50 \nliberties, empowering American Muslims and building coalitions that promote social \njustice and mutual understanding.  CATR is the largest Islamic civil liberties organi~ation \nin the United States with more than 30 affiliated sister chapters throughout the United \nStates and Canada representing the interests of over seven million Ame1ican Muslims. \n97.  CAIR's Communications Department works in conjunction with local, \nnational an<;! international media outlets to ensure that an accurate portrayal of Islam and \nMuslims is presented lo the general public. CAIR 's daily news release service reaches \nindividua.ls and intemational media outlets on a daily basis.  Because of its \ncommunications work, CA TR has become a respected and credible source for journalists \nand other media professionals worldwide.  CAlR representatives are regularly \ninterviewed by CNN, BBC World Service, FOX News, The Washington Post, The New \nYork Times, and The Los Angeles Times, as well as media outlets throughout the \nMuslim world, such as Al-Jaz.eera, Al-Arabi ya, the Middle East Broadcasting Company \n(MBC), GEO TV (Pakistan), Al-A11ram, and other intemational print and broadcast \noutlets. \n98.  Because of its advocacy work, CAIR makes international telephone \ncalls and write emails to journalists worldwide. \n99.  C:AIR's international media communications an\" vital to its \norganizational goals of enhancing understanding oflslam, facililali11g inter-cultural \nunderstanding, ensuring fair and accurate portrayals of Islam and Muslims in the media, \nand serving as a bridge between American and the Muslim world.  CAIR's \ncommunications with members of the American Muslim community arc also an essential \npart of its organizational success. Many members of the American Muslim community \n27 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 28 of 50 \ncommunicate, both clcctrnnically and otherwise, to their families abroad. \n100.  CATR ·~ international media comnnmications cover a range of subjects \nthat are likely to trigger NSA scmtiny under the Program.  These subjects incl Lide Islam, \nextremism, post-9111 policies, surveillance, terrolism and counterterrorism, the war in \nIraq and the American Muslim community. \n101.  CATR's Communications Department drafts press releases, edits \nopinion articles and coordinates public education campaigns related to CAlR's missmn \nand vision.  In this role, CAIR's Communications Department receives calls from \njournalists from all over the world who seek infomiation or official comment from the \nAmerican Muslim perspective on issues related to CATR's press releases or official \npositions. \n102.  The Program suhstantially impairs lhe ability of CATR lo engage in \ncommunications that are vital to its mission and the ability of!he American Muslim \ncommunity to freely communicate abroad without the fear of being placed under \nunlawful surveillance. \n103.  As a civil rights organi;i;ation, CAIR also communicates confidential \ninformation about pending civil rights cases via international telephone calls and emails. \n104.  For example, alter lwo high-profile individuals, musician Cat Stevens \n(known as Yusufislam since his conversion to Islam) and world-renowned academic \nTariq Ramadan, named one of TIME Magazine's Top 100 Innovators, were denied \nadmission to the United States; CAIR personally spoke with and emailed each of the \nindividuals abroad. \n105.  The members of the American Muslim community, many of whom are \n28 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 29 of 50 \nmembers of CAIR, are engaged in efforts of commerce, education and social services \nwith individuals and institutions in the Muslim world.  The work of the A:mericai1-\nM uslim community in being able to engage freely in commerce, education and social \nservices in the l'v1uslim world is a vi la.I part of building bridges between America and the \nMuslim world and thus, is integral to America's national security and vital interests.  The \nProgram substantially impairs the ability of the American Muslim community to engage \nin collllnunications that arc vital to America's national interests. \n106.  The communications of C:AlR, its members and the American Muslim \ncommunity with individuals and journalists abroad are an integral part of the mission and \nvision of CA IR, specifically related to building bridges of understanding between \nAmerica and the Muslim world. The possibility that the Ami;:rican Muslim c(llmnunity's \ninternational electronic communications are being intercepted by the NSA impinges their \nability to communicate freely and candidly in their international communications. \nCA1R-Michigan \nI 07.  CAIR-Michigan is a non-profit and non-partisan grassroots organization \ndedicated to enhancing the general public's understanding ofislam, protecting civil \nliberties, empowering American Muslims and building coalitions that promote social \njustice and mutual understanding. \n108.  Because of its advocacy and civil rights work, CATR-Michigan makes \nintemational telephone calls and writes emails to journalists worldwide related lo the \nlarge American Muslim population within the state of Michigan. \n109.  CAIR-Michigan's media communications are vital to its organizational \ngoals of enhancing a better understanding ofislam, facilitating inter-cultural \n29 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 30 of 50 \nunderstanding and ensuring fair and accurate portrayals oflslam and M LLs\\ims in the \nmedia.  CAIR-Michigan's communications are also essential to the organization's \ncommunication with its members in the American Muslim conununity in Michigan; \nmany o I' whom communicate, both electronically and otherwise, to their families abroad. \nNa7,ihllas~ \n110.  Nazih Hassan is a member of CAIR-Michigan who resides in \nWashtenaw County, Michigan.  He was born in Lebanon in 1969, and became a legal \npcnnanent resident of the United States in 2001.  From 2002 to 2003, he served as the \npresident of the Muslim Community Associalion of /\\nn Arbor.  He has served as chair \non MCA' Board of Directors from mid-2005 to the present.  Mr. Hassan works as a \ntechnology consultant. \n111.  Mr. Hassan has friends and family in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, France, \nAustralia and Canada with whom he frequently communicates by telephone and email. \nAmong the people with whom he communicates by phone and email are his friends !slam \nAhnurabit and Rabih Haddad. \n112.  Mr. Haddad is a native of Lebanon who was educated in the United \nStates and lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan for more than 3 years.  Mr. Haddad was an \nactive member and popular volunteer teacher at the mosque to which Mr. Hass<1.n \nbelongs.  Mr. Haddad co-founded Global Relief Foundation (GRF) in 1993, a \nhumanitarian organization which the federal government has accused of having provided \nmaterial support for tenorism.  ln December 2001, Mr. Haddad was arrested for an \nimmigration violation on the same day that the offices of GRF were raided. Mr. Haddad \nwas held for about a year before being deported to Lebanon.  As one of the two media \n30 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 31 of 50 \ncoordinators for the Free Rabih Haddad Commi!tee, Mr. Hassan drafted press releases, \nspoke to the media and organized public demonstrations against the detention of Mr. \nHaddad.  Mr. Hassan visits Rabih Haddad when he returns to Lebanon for vacations. \n113.  Islam Alnrnrabit, the fo1mer executive director oflslamic Assembly of \nNorth Arnerich, lived in Ann Arbor for approximately 7-8 years.  Tn 2003, after the IANA \noffices were raided in Ypsilanti, Mr. Almurabit was visited by !he FBI and accused of \nbeing a supporter of extremism.  Rather than face continual harassment by the FBI, Mr. \nA lmurabit left the United States in 2004 or 2005 and lJloved to Saudi Arabia. \n114.  Prior to beco111ing aware of the NSA Program, Mr. Hassan would speak \nwith or communicate with family members about various political topics and their \nopinions on current events including Tslan1 and the war in Iraq, Islamic fundamentalists, \nterrorism, Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, the war in Afghanistan and the riots in France and \nAustralia.  Mr. Hassan would also participate in online discussion groups or bulletin \nboards about the war in Afghanistan on foreign websites in order to learn what people \nfrom other count1ies were thinking and to voice objections to those who favored \nextremism. \n115.  Because of his activism in the United States, his friendship with Islam \nAhnurabit and Rabih Haddad, and his frequent communications with numerous people in \nthe Middle East and other foreign countries about topics likely to trigger monitoring, MT. \nHassan has a well-founded belief that his communications are currently being intercepted \nby the NSA under the Program. \n116.  The likelihood that his communications are being intercepted by the \nNSA under the Program impinges on Mr. Hassan's ability to communicate freely and \n31 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 32 of 50 \ncandidly in his calls and emails.  Since learning of the NSA Program in news reports, he \nhas refrained from talking about m emailing friends and family abroad about any topic \nthat might trigger monitoring.  He has not called his friends Islam Al-Murabit or Rabih \nHaddad or engaged in email communications with them about anything political for fear \nthat such commu11ications would somehow be taken out of context or misconstrued as \nsupport for extremism.  Finally, he no longer visits websites or discussion groups where \nsome people advocate extremism, even though his purp(lse in participating in the \ndiscussion groups previously had been to oppose extremism. \n117.  The Program also interferes with J\\.fr. Hassan's efforts lo promote peace \nand justice in this country.  Before he became aware of the NSA Program, he felt free to \nengage in free and open communication with people in other countries about critical \nissues of the day.  He gained unique insight from these conversations into U.S. forcii;,'11 \npolicy that he could not gain from the media in this country.  Mr. Hassan used these \ncommunications in his political work in the United States to educate Americans about the \nconsequences l)fU.S. policy abroad.  Because of the Program, he is no longer engaging \nin substantive discussions with people abroad and therefore is not able to either gain these \nunique insights or share them with others. \nGreenpeace \n118.  Plaintiff Greenpeace is an advocacy organization dedicated to \ncombating the most serious threats tc) the planet's biodiversity and environment.  Since \n1971, Greenpeace has been at the forefront of environmental activism through non\" \nviolent protest, research, lobbying, and public education.  Greenpeace has approximately \n250,000 members and seven offic.es in the United States.  Greenpeace is associated with \n32 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 33 of 50 \ninternational Greenpeace entities, which have a presence in 39 other countries and more \nthan 2.5 million members. \n119.  As part of its international environmental advocacy, Greenpeace leaders \nand staff engage in international communications, via telephone and email, on a daily \nbasis.  Individuals contacted include staff members of Greenpeace offices in other \ncountries, representatives of multinational organizations, governmental officials, \nscientific ex.pe1is, ru1d Greenpeace members.  GreenpeacG communicates by telephone \nand email with people in the Netherlands, England, Germany, Canada, Mexico, Australia, \nBrazil, Tndia and Japan. \n120.  Greenpeace is aware that it has been targeted for surveillance in the past \nby the NSA.  For exarnple, in 1992 British intelligence officials revealed to the London \nObserver that in the 1990s the NSA had used the word \"Greenpeace\" as a keyword to \nintercept communications outside the United States.  Government documents recently \noh tamed under the Freedom of Infonnation Act (FOIA) reveal that Greenpeace has been \nthe subject of sunrcillance by the FBI and Joint Ternirism Task Forces, whose internal \ndocuments contend that the organization is associated with \"suspicious activity with a \ncollllection to international terrorism.\"  Documents obtained through the FOIA also \nindicate that the FBI has us<:ld confidential informants to obtain infom1atiou about \nGreenpeace activities. \n121.  Greenpeace's recent activities also make the organization a likely target \nfor government surveillance.  In the past several years, Greenpeace has repeatedly \nengaged the Bush administration through public protest and activism.  In 200 I, \nGreenpeace held public demonstrations outside the personal residences of President Bush \n33 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 34 of 50 \nand Vice President Cheney, attacking the administration's environmental and energy \npolicies. Greenpeace has also actively publicized the Bush administration's ties to the oil \nindustry, particularly to ExxonMobil.  Seventeen Greenpeace activists were anested in \n2001 in connection with a p1.·otest aimed at disrupting a \"star wars\" missile test at \nVandenberg Air Force Base.  In 2002, Greenpeace protestors chained themselves to gas \npumps at ExxonMobil stations in New York and Los Angeles, carrying banners that \ncalled on the Bush administration to stop favoring the oil industry over the environment. \nln 2003, there were several European protests against the war in Traq by Greenpeace \nactivists, including one al Rota Naval Air Base in Spain.  More recently, a team of \ninternational Greenpeace experts exposed the United States' military's failure to secure \nand contain nuclear waste fi.1cilities in Iraq. \n122.  Bccacise of the nature of Greenpeace's international communications, \nGreenpeace's recent activities, and the U.S. government's past surveillance of \nGreenpeace, Greenpeace has a well-founded belief that its international communications \nare currently being intercepted by the NSA under the Program. \n123.  Greenpeace's telephone calls, emails, and other Internet \ncommunications with individuals and organizations abroad are vital to its organizational \ngoal of addressing enviromnental problems of glohal magnitude.  This mission requires \nfree and open communication with international colleagues, members, experts, and \nleaders of governments and industry. \n124.  The Program substantially impairs the ability of Greenpeace to engage \nin communications that are vital to i!s mission.  Kn(lwledgc of the Program requires \nGreenpeace staff to minimize !he sensitive infonnation they include in their international \n34 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 35 of 50 \nelectronic communications and to be more circumspect and less candid in their \ncommunications to members and others.  Greenpeace also believes that people abroad are \nmore reticent in communicating with Greenpeace because of the lihlihood that their \nconversations will be monitored by the NSA under the Program.  (rreenpeacc fears that \nthe Program will enable the U.S. government to dismpl Greenpeace's lawful activities by \ntaking preemptive action against legitimate, and peaceful, protests. \nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers \n125.  The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACOL) is a \nDistrict of Columbia non-profit organization whose membership is comprised of over \n13,000 lawyers and 28,000 affiliate members representing every stale.  The NACOL was \nfounded in 1958 to promote study and research in the field of criminal law; to \ndisseminate and advance knowledge of the law in the area of criminal practice; and to \nencourage the integrity, independence, and expertise of defense lawyers in criminal cases. \n126.  NACOL is concerned with the erosion of due process and the rights of \ncriminal defendants and suspects generally, but particularly so with respect to the impact \nof the \"War on Tenor\" upon lhe criminal justice system, due process, and the protections \nafforded by the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. \n127.  NACDL has been active with respect to those issues.  NACDL has filed \namicus briefs in a considerable number of cases involving the infringement of rights \nprecipitated by !he War on Terror, including in the Courts of Appeal, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review, and the Supreme Court.  NA CDT. has been \ninvolved as amicus in all of the cases involving the rights of detainees, either U.S. \nciti;~ens or those held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in the lower and appeals courts. \n35 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 36 of 50 \n128.  NACDL also has at least three com111ittecs that address these issues:  its \nSelect Committee on Military Tribunals, its international Law Committee, and its Ethics \nCommittee.  Its Amicus Curiae Committee has also been intensively involved in these \nissues. \n129.  Al least fifty NACDL members currently represent or have represented \nterrorism suspects, and many of these members regularly communicate with people \noutside the United States.  Because of the nature of!hese communications, the identities \nof the individuals with whom they communicate, and the locations of individuals with \nwhom thev communicate, NACDL members have a well-found beliefthal their \ncommunications are being intercepted by !he NSA under the Program.  The Program is \ninhibiting communications that are necessary for NACDL members to provide effective \nlegal representation to !heir clients. \nJoshua L. Dratel \n130.  Joshua L. Dratcl is a nationally recognized criminal defense lawyer in \nNew York City.  Mr. Dratel is  a member ofNACDL's Board of Directors and Co-Chair \nof its Select Committee on Military Tribunals.  He is also co-editor of The Torture \nPapers:  The Legal Road to Abu Ghraib (Cambridge University Press:  2005). \n13 J _  Mr. Dratel currently represents a number of individuals who have been \naccused by !he federal government of terrorism-related crimes.  For example, Mr. Dratel \nis lead counsel for David Hicks, whom the United States government has detained as an \nenemy combatant at Guantanan10 Bay since 2001, and who is being prosecuted by the \nU.S. military commission.  Mr. Dratel also represents Lynne Stewart, a criminal defense \nlawyer accused of providing material support for terrorism_  Mr. Dratel also represents \n36 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 37 of 50 \nMohamed El-Mezain in a federal prosecution charging material support for te1Torism, and \nWadih El-Hage, a defendant in United States v.  Usama Bin Laden (the Embassy \nBombings case), in Mr. El-Hage's pending appeal of his conviction.  Mr, Dratcl also \nrepresented Sami Omru· Al-Hnssayen, who was acquitted in federal cou1i in Idaho of \nproviding material support for terrorism based on the technical support he provided to \nweb sites and discussitln boards about terrorism and jihad. \n132.  ln representing these and other clients, Mr. Dratel routinely engages in \ntelephone and email communications with witnesses, foreign counsel, experts, \njournalists, and government officials in Israel, Gcm1any, Australia, the United Kingdom, \nand elsewhere.  He also routinely communicates with the family members of his clients, \nmany of whom reside in other countries.  These conununications are essential to his \neffective representation of his clients. \n133.  In representing these and other clients, Mr. Dratel conducts research and \naccesses discussion boards on the lnte1net as an integral par! of the investigatory process. \nThis research often includes review of web sites that allegedly support terrorism and \njihad, and/or discuss the issues, including qoqaz.com, azzam.com, alasr.ws, palestine \ninfo.org, islamway.com, and cageprisoners.com, among many others.  Because of the \ncharges against Sarni Omar Al-Hussayen, Mr. Dratel reviewed hundreds of such web \nsites and discussion boards in preparation for trial.  Mr. Dratel also engages in keyword \nsearches using terms such as \"Usama bin Laden,\" \"Chechnya,\" \"qoqaz,\" \"Sheikh Safer \nal-Hawaii,\" \"Sheikh Salman al Odah,\" and \"Hamas.\" \n134.  Because of the nature of his conununications, the identities of people \nwith whom he communicates, and the subject matter of his onlinc re~earch, Mr. Dratel \n37 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 38 of 50 \nhas a well-founded belief that his communicalions arc heing intercepted under the \nProgram. \n135.  The Program has already inhibited co111munications between Mr. Dratcl \nand individuais in other countries that are necessary to provide effective legal \nrepresentation to his clients.  Since learning of the Program, Mr. Orate! has ceased having \ncertain kinds of discussions over the telephone or by cmai.l for fear that lhe government \nmay be monitoring his conmrnnicatfons. \nNancy Hollander \n136.  Nancy Hollander, a member and past President ofNACDL, is a \nnationally recognized criminal defense lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Ms. \nHollander is co-chair ofNACDL's lntcmalional Affairs Committee and also in charge of \nrecruiting volunteers to represent prisoners at Guantanamo. \n13 7.  Ms. Hollander currently represents organizations and individuals who \nhave been accused by the federal government ofte1TOrism-related crimes.  For exan1plc, \nMs. Hollander represents Holy Land Foundation and its Executive Director Shukri Abu \nBaker, who are currently under indictment in Dallas, Texas charged with providing \nmaterial support lo a terrorist organization.  She also represents Mohammcdou Ould \nSalahi, who the federal govemm<:'nt has declared an enemy combatant and who has been \ndetained at Guantanamo Bay since 2002.  She also represented Fawaz Damrah, who was \ncharged and convicted in Ohio of naturalization crimes but whom the federal goveminent \nattempted to link to Sarni Al-A1ian, a profossor accused and recently acquitted in Florida \nof terrorism-related crimes. \n38 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 39 of 50 \n138.  The nature of Ms. Hollander's legal practice requires her to \ncommunicate regularly by email and telephone with individuals outside the United States. \nThese communications arc essential in providing effoc!ive representation to her clients. \nliar example, in representing thes\"' and other clients, Ms. Hollander routinely \ncommunicates by telephone and email with witnesses, foreign counsel, experts, \njournalists, government officials and political figures in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, \nEgypt, and other countries in the Middle East, as well as in Mauritania. \n139.  In representing these and other clients, Ms. Hollander also conducts \nresearch on !he Internet about terrorism, religion, and polities in the Middle East and \nSouth Asia, and also participates in Internet discussions on these topics.  Ms. Ho! lander \nroutinely searches web sites using key words such as \"Hamas,\" \"Palcstianian Islamic \n.Jihad,\" \"muhajadin,\" and \"suicide bomber.\"  This research is a necessary component of \nthe investigatory process. \n140.  Because of the nature of her communications, the identities of people \nwith whom she communicates, and the subject matter of her on line research, Ms. \nHollander has a we11·founded belief that his communications are being intercepted by the \nNSA under the Program. \n141.  The Program has already inhibited communications between Ms. \nHollander and individuals in the Middle East that are necessary to provide effective legal \nrepresentation to her clients.  Since learning of the Program, Ms. Hollander has ceased \nhaving certain kinds of discussions over the telephone or by email for fear that t11c \ngovernment may be monitoring her communications.  Ms. Hollander has decided that \nshe will no longer communicate by phone or email about any strategic or privileged \n39 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 40 of 50 \nmatters with her clients charged in terrorism related cases, or with witnesses, experts, \npotential experts and co-counsel outside the United Stales.  Jn one cunent case, Ms_ \nHollander is planning an expensive trip to obtain information that she would have \npreviously obtained via telephone and email. \nWilliam W. Swor \n142.  William W. Swor is a member of the NACDL, and a member of the \nBoard of Directors of the Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan.  He maintains a \nprivate practice or law in Detroit, Michigan.  His practice is primarily in the areas of \nfederal criminal defense and immigration law. \n143.  Mr. Swor has represented, currently represents and expects !o represent \nin the future, individuals who were investigated and or prosecuted under one or more of \nthe federal terrorism-related statutes_  For example, Mr. Swor rcpre~ents Abdcl-Ilah \nElmardoudi who was wrongfolly accused by the United States of providing material aid \nin support of terrorism.  Mr. Swor also represents Mahmoud Kourani who was accused \nby the United States of providing material aid to Hezbollah, in Lebanon.  Mr. Swor has \nother matters pending, both criminal and immigration matters, in several federal districts \nin which his clients arc being investigated or prosecuted under one or more of the federal \nterrorism-related statutes. \n144.  In representing these and other clients, Mr. Swor conducts research on \nthe Jntcrnet about terrorism, religion and politics in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, \nAfrica and the Caucasus Mountain region.  This research includes review of sites that \nsupport terrorism and/or organizations that the United States has declared Foreign \nTerrorist Organizations (FTOs).  This research is a necessary component of his \n40 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 41 of 50 \npreparation of his cases.  Based upon discovery provided by the United States in pending \nmatters, he will continue to need to refer lo these sites for infonnatiort \n145.  The nature of Mr. Swor's legal practice also requires him to \ncommunicate by telephone with individuals outside of the United States, including \nindividuals whose communications are likely to have been intercepted under the \nProgram.  These individuals are witnesses, potential experts, journalists, and others who \nare located in tbe Middle East, e.g. Lebanon, and Jordan, as well as western European \ncountries such as France and England.  These communications are essential in providing \neffective representation to his clients. \n146.  Mr. Swor has a well-founded belief that his communications are being \nintercepted hy the NSA under the program.  The Program has already iJJhibited \ncommunications between Mr. Swor and individuals in the Middle East that are necessary \n\\(1 provide effective legal representation to his clients.  Since learning of the Program, Mr. \nSwor has avoided having cmtain kinds of discussions over the telephone or email for fear \nthat the government may be monitoring his communications.  Mr. Swor believes that he \nwill now have to schedule one or more trips overseas to interview witnesses and to ohtain \ninfom1ation that he would have previously been able to obtain via telephone and email \ncommunications. \n.James Bamford \n147.  Plaintiff James Bamford, of Washington, D.C., is an award-winning and \nbestselling author and journalist.  He is one of the world's leading experts on U.S. \nintelligence generally and lhe National Security Agency specifically.  Mr. Bamford is the \nauthor of A Pretext for War:  9/11, Irnq, and the Abuse of America's Intelligence \n41 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 42 of 50 \nAgencies (Doubleday, 2004), Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National \nSecurity Agency (Doubleday, 2001), and The Puzzle Palace:  A Report on NSA, \nAmerica's Most Secret Agency (H(mghton Mifflin, 1982).  Mr. Bamford has written \nextensively on national sccwily issues for a range of newspapers a11d magazines, \nincluding investigative cover stories for The New York Times Magazine, The \nWashington Post Magazine, and The Los Angeles Times Magazine.  From 1989 -1 998, \nhe was the Washington investigative producer for ABC's World News Tonight with Peter \nJennings.  In 2002, he was a distinguished visiting professor of National SecL1rity at the \nGoldman School of Public Policy, University of California, Berkeley. \n148.  As an expert on intelligence, Mr. Bamford has testified before \nco111111ittees of both the Senate and House of Representatives as well as the European \nParliament in Brussels and the International Criminal Tribunal for the fonner Yugoslavia. \nHe has also been a guest speaker at the Central Intelligence Agency's Senior Intelligence \nFellows Progran1, the National Security Agency's National Cryptologic School, the \nDefense Intelligence Agency's Joint Military Intelligence College, the Pentagon's \nNational Defense Umversity and Air War College, and the Director of National \nIntelligence's National Counterintelligence Executive. \n149.  Mr. Bamford first experie1ic.ed the impact of illegal NSA eavesdropping \non Americans, and the lengths to which the U.S. government will go to prevent \ndisclosure of its spying programs, thirty years ago.  As Mr. Bamford was wri!ing The \nPuzzle Palace. he discovered that the Justice Depa11mc11t in 1976, during the Ford \nadministration, began a secret criminal investigation into widespread illegal domestic \ncavesdnlpping by the NSA.  Mr. Bamford filed a request under the Freedom of \n42 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 43 of 50 \nInformation Acl for documents dealing with that investigation.  Several hundred pages of \ndocuments were eventually released lo h.im in 1979.  The documents showed that the FBI \nquestioned senior NSA officials about the possibility of their having violated federal \ncriminal laws by engaging in warrnntlcss eavesdropping of American citizens.  \"The \ninvestigation,\" said the documents, \"uncovered 23 differe11t categories of questionable \nactivities.\"  However, because oflhe secrecy of the operations, and the fact that law was \nundefined in this area, the Justice Depiiliment decided against prosecution and instead \nrecommended that new law5 be created to outlaw this type of activity. \n150.  Shortly a Iler President Ronald Reagan took office, the Justice \nDepartment, at the request of!he NSA, notified Mr. Bamford that lhe documents had \nbeen \"reclassified\" as top secret and demanded their return.  When Mr. Barn f(lrd refused, \nsaying that they had been properly declassified and released lo him by the Carter \nadministration, he was threatened with prosecution.  Mr. Bamford then cited the \npresidential executive order on secrecy which stated that once a document had been \ndeclassified, it cannot be reclassified.  As a result, President Reagan changed the \nexecutive order to indicate that once a document has been declassified it can be \nreclassified.  However, because !he order could not be applied retroactively, the new \nexecutive order could not be applied to Mr. Bamford and the infonn<ttion was \nsubsequently published in The Puzzle Palace. \n151.  During that period, sources necessary to Mr. Bamford's investigative \njournalism were much less willing to communicate with him due to the likelihood that his \ncommunications were being intercepted by the NSA.  The NSA had previously placed \nanother writer, David Kahn, on its watch list, and intercepted his communications, as he \n43 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 44 of 50 \nwas writing his history of cryplology, The Codcbrcakers.  According to the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, the agency also considered undertaking \"clandestine service \napplications\" against the author, which apparently meant anything from physical \nsurveillance to conducting a \"surreptitious entry\" into Kalm's New York home. \n152.  Mr. Bamford's recent work has again made it likely that his \ncommunications are being intercepted by the NSA.  For example, in the fall of2001, Mr. \nBamford received a book contract from Doubleday Publishing Company lo write A \nPretext for War, which documents the intellige110e mistakes that led lo the nation's failure \nto prevent the 9/11  attacks and lhe Bush administration's subsequent misuse of \nintelligence to sell preemptive war to the American people. \n153.  Since the fall of2001, Mr. Bamford has also written more than two \ndozen articles, reviews and opinion pieces on intelligence, 9111, and the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.  These include \"Where Spying Starts and Stops\" (The New York Times, \nJanuary 2006), \"The Agency That Could Be Big Brother\" (The New York Times, \nDecember 2005), \"The Labyrinthine Morass of Spying in the Cold War\" (The New York \nTimes, July 2003), \"This Spy For Rent\" (The New York Times, June 2004), \"How To \nDe-Centralize Intelligence\" (The New York Times, Novernber 2002), ''War of Secrets\" \n(The New York Times, September 2005), \"Washington Bends The Rules\" (The New \nYork Times, September 2002), \"A Fonner CIA Cowboy and his Disillusioning Ride\" \n(The New York Times, September 2002), \"We're Watching Them\" (The Washington \nPost, Febrnary 2005), \"Sowing the Whirlwind\" (The Washington Post, Febrnary 2004), \n\"A Look Over My Shoulder\" (The Washington Post, April 2003), \"Shadow Warriors\" \n(The Washington Post, December 2002), \"Strategic Thinking\" (The Washington Post, \n44 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 45 of 50 \nSeptember 2002), \"The Wrong Man\" (The Washington Post, January 2002), \"Intelligence \nFailures\" (The Washington Post, June 2002), \"Maintain CIA's Independence\" (USA \nToday, October 2002), \"U1m:sted Administration Hawks Clamor for War\" (USA Today, \nSeptember 2002), \"Bush Wrong to Use Pretext as Excuse to lnvadc Iraq\" (USA Today, \nAugust 2002), \"Linguist Reserve Corp Answers Terror Need\" (USA Today, July 2002), \n\"Secret Warriors: The Great Game\" (The Los Angeles Times, May 2004), \"Secrets on \nHigh\" (The Los Angeles Times, March 2003), \"The Man Whu Sold The War\" (Rolling \nStone, December 2005) and \"Breeding Terror: The Intelligence Community Analyzes a \nCotmterproduclive War\" (The American Conservative, March 2005).  Mr. Bamford also \nis a contributing editor for Rolling Stone and has served on the USA Today Board of \nContributors. \n154.  Communicating with individuals i11 Traq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in \nthe Middle East via email and telephone is a vital part ofMr. Bamford's work as an \nauthor and journalist.  Mr. Bamford's sources in the Middle East include people \nworking for the United States military and intelligence agencies, intelligence officials in \nother countries, intelligence experts, and foreign journalists specializing in writing on \nintelligence. \n155.  Mr. Bamford's email communications include discussions of the NSA, \nCentral Intelligence Agency, military strategies related to the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and the 9111 attacks and other terrorist attacks.  The people with whom Mr. \nBamford has communicated, the locations of people with whom he has communicated, \nand the content of his communications are all likely to have triggered scrutiny by the \nNSA under the Program. \n45 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 46 of 50 \n156.  Mr. Bamford also frequently communicates by telephone and email \nwith journalists in the Middle East, both as part of his research and because he is often \ninterviewed as an expert on U.S. intelligence.  For example, he has appeared several \ntimes on Al-Jazeera, the leading teh;vision network in the Arab world. \n157.  As part of his research, Mr. Bamford also frequently visits web sites \nthat are likely to trigger NSA scrutiny.  For example, Mr. Bamford has researched web \nsites about ten-orism, jihad, Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, Islamic fundamentalism, \nSaddam Hussein, weapons of mass destruction, and signals intelligence.  One web site, \nJihad Unleashed, includes translations of Osama bin Laden's communications.  Some of \nthese web sites express support for terrorism. \n158.  Mr. Bamford's ability to research and write about the NSA, \nintelligence, and the war on terror is seriously compromised by the Program.  Because the \nProgram substantially increases the likelihood that his communications are being \nintercepted by the NSA, Mr. Bamford is less able to communicate freely and candidly in \nhis international calls and emails.  ln addition, because of the Program, Mr. Bamford \nbelieves that sources who have first-hand knowledge about intelligence failures and \nabuses are less willing to engage in communications with him. \nLarry Diamond \n159.  Larry Diamond is a senior fellow al the Hoover Institution, Stanford \nUniversity, and founding coeditor of the Joumal of Democracy.  He is also codirector of \nthe hltemational Fornm for Democratic Studies of the National Endowment for \nDemocracy. At Stanford University, he is professor by courtesy of political science and \nsociology and coordinates the democracy program of the Center on Democracy, \n46 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 47 of 50 \nDevelopment, and the Rule of Law.  During 2002-03, he served as a consultant to the \nU.S. Agency for International Development (USA IO) and was a contributing author of its \nreport Foreign Aid in the National Interest.  Currently he serves as a member ofUSATD's \nAdvisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid.  Professor Diamond has also advised \nand lectured to the World Bank, the United Nations, the State Department, and other \ngovernmental and nongovernmental agencies dealing with governance and development. \n160.  During the first three months of 2004, Professor Diamond served as a \nsenior adviser on governance to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad.  He is \nnow lecturing and writing about the challenges ofpost,conflict state building in Iraq, and \nthe challenges of developing and promoting democracy around the world, with a \nparticular focus on the Middle East and Africa.  Professor Diamond has worked with a \ngroup of Europeans and A.mericans to produce the Transatlantic Strategy for Democracy \nand Human Development in lhe Broader Middle East, published in 2004 by the German \nMarshall Fund of the United Stales,  During 2004-5, he has been a member of the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations' Independent Task Force on United Stales Policy Toward \nArab Refo1m. \n161.  Professor Diamond is the author of numerous books, including \nSquandered Victory: The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring \nDemocracy to Iraq (Times Books, 2005).  His recent edited books include Islam a11d \nDemocracy in the Middle East (with Marc F. Plattner and Daniel Brumberg) and \nAssessing the Quality of Democracy (with Leonardol\\forlino). \n162.  Professor Diamond's work requires him to communicate by email, and \noccasionally by telephone, with advocates of democracy in lhe Middle East, Asia, and \n47 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 48 of 50 \nAfrica.  For example, Professor Diamo11d corresponds by email with Saad Eddin Ibrahim, \na leading advocate of democratic refonn in Egypt, and with Professor Maye Kassem, a \npolitical scientist at the American University in Cairo.  Professor Diamond corresponds \nwith Adel Abdellatif of the United Nations Development Program in Beiruit.  Professor \nDiamond also corresponds with advocates for democratic reform in many other countries, \nincluding Iran, the Palestinian Authority, Pakistan, China, the Philippines, Nigeria, \nKenya, and Uganda. \n163.  Professor Diamond has a well-founded belief that his communications \nare being intercepted by the Program. \n164.  Some of Professor Diamond's correspondence with individuals in the \nMiddle East and Asia concerns political and human rights issues that are extremely \nsensitive.  For example, Professor Diamond has coJTesponded with Sana Baloch, a \nPakistani Senator, about human rights issues in Baluchistan.  Profossor Diamond believes \nthat Senator Baloch would not have provided him with this information had he believed \nthat communications with Professor Diamond were monitored by the United States \ngovernment. Profossor Diamond believes that the existence of the Program makes it less \nlikely that individuals in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, China, and elsewhere in the \nMiddle East and Asia will provide him with sensitive information over email or by \ntelephone in the future. \nI 65,  Because Professor Diamond is a well-known scholar of democratic \nreform, he is occasionally contacted unsolicited by individuals who live under repressive \ngovernments and have complaints about !heir governments' policies.  Professor Diamond \nbelieves that the Program makes it substantially less likely that such individuals will \n48 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 49 of 50 \ncontact him.  Professor Diamond believes that this is particularly true of individuals who \nlive under repressive governments that have close relations with the United States, such \nas Pakistan, EgyPt, and Kazakhstan, because these individuals will reasonably fear that \ntheir communications may ultimately be provided by the United States to their own \ngovernments. \n166.  Professor Diamond's ability to advocate and advise on democratic \nreform in the Middle East and Asia depends in part on the willingness of political \ndissidents to contact him, to consult with him, and to provide him with information about \ntheir own governments' policies.  Professor Diamond believes that the Program infobits \nthe exchange of infom1ation and ideas among advocates of democratic refonn and the \nvictims of human rights abuses and defenders of human 1ights, and thereby compromises \nhis ability to study the progress of democratic reform and support those in the Middle \nEast and Asia who advocate change. \n167.  Additionally, Professor Diamond is concerned about the implications of \nthe program for academic freedom.  He periodically has undergraduate and graduate \nstudents who travel lo !he Middle East, Asia, and Ar rica to conduct research on sensitive \npolitical questiuns and who need to be in touch with him by email for advice and \ncoordination while in the field.  For example, this past summer, one of his Stanford \nundergraduate advisees, Omar Shakir, worked for him as a research assistant in EgyPt \ninterviewing opposition activists, intellectuals, and advocates of democratic change. \nShakir sent weekly reports back to Professor Diamond and they communicated by email \nwhile he was in Egypt.  Professor Diamond believes the Program inhibits the conduct and \ncoordination of overseas research and the supervision of student research by impairing \n49 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 50 of 50 \nthe ability to communicate freely and responsibly wi!h his students and assistants \noverseas, who often give their interviewees pledges of strict confidentiality. \nCh risto1>her Hitchens \n168.  Christopher Hitchens is a reporter and author based in Washington, \nD.C.  He is a prominent and controversial commentator who is vocal in his suppo11 for \nthe military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Mr. Hitchens writes frequently on the \npolitics of the Middle East.  Many of his articles focus on understanding the role and \ninfluenc0 of Islamic fundamentalism in the region.  He also probes the success ofUnitcd \nStates policy in assuaging the threat to security posed by Muslim terrorists harbored in \nthe Middle East and West Asia. \n169.  Mr. Hitchens' reportage and analysis appear in numerous publications. \nHe has published in Harpers, The Spectator, The Nation, New York Newsday, and \nAtlantic Monthly.  He currently is a frequent contributor to Slate and Vanity Fair.  Mr. \nHitchens writes a regularly featured column for Slate called Fighting Words, which he \nused to voice his strong support for the allied military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHe has traveled throughout the Middle East on behalf of Vanity Fair in order to write a \nseries of articles describing the political climate in various countries.  Mr. Hitchens is \nalso a best-selling author of several books.  In 2003, he published A Long Short War: The \nPostponed Liberation of Iraq, a c<lllection of essays analyzing arguments for and against \nthe war in Iraq.  In 2005, he contributed an essay to Thomas Cushman's compilation A \nMatter of Principle: Humanitarian Arguments for War in Iraq. \nI 70.  Mr. Hitchens' work requires him to maintain frequent contact with \nsources in the Middle East and Western Asia.  Such communications were necessary for \n50 \n\n2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW   Doc # 1-2   Filed 01/17/06   Pg 1 of 12    Pg ID 1\nhim to research his Vanity Fair articles 011 political conditions in various Midd.le East \nstates.  These articles mclude \"On the Frontier of Apocalypse\" on Pakistan (January \n2002), \"The Maverick Kingdom\" on Qatar (Decernber 2002), \"Saddam's Long Good \nByc\" on Kuwait (June 2003), \"A Prayer for Indonesia\" (January 2004), \"Afghanistan's \nDangerous Bet\" (November 2004), and \"Iran's Waiting Game\" (July 2005).  Mr. \nHitchens' upcon1ing book and continuing journalism will involve contact wilh, and visits \nto, the Middle East and Western Asia. \n171.  As part of his work, Mr. Hitchens regularly exchanges emails and \ntelephone calls wi!h individuals in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, \nQatar and Kuwait.  In a typical week, Mr. Hitchens hears from individuals in st'lveral of \nthese counhies.  For example, Mr. Hitchens has spoken with Dr. Masuda Jalal, the only \nwoman who ran for president of Afghanistan; Hossein Khomeini, a cleric whose \ngrandfather overthrew the Iranian monarchy in J 979; Ali Mohmmcd Kamal, a TV \nmarketing director for Al Jazeera; and Sardar Sikander Haya! Khan, the prime minister of \nPakistani Kashmir.  Mr. Hitchens' communications to the Middle East and Western Asia \ninclude contacting journalists of a variety of nationalities and individuals in the United \nStates military and diplomatic corps. He also contacts those who are actively hostile to \nthe United States military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan and the United States \nmore generally.  Because of the subject mal(er of his reporting, many of Mr. Hitchens' \ncommunications involve discussions oflslamic fundamentalism, te1Toiism, jihad, Osania \nbin Laden, al Qaeda, and Saddam Hussein. \n172.  Since well before 200 I, but more regularly and frequently since then, \nMr. Hitchens' work has required him to travel to the Middle East and Western Asia. \n51 \n\n2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW   Doc # 1-2   Filed 01/17/06   Pg 2 of 12    Pg ID 2\nSince 2001, the countries he has visited include Traq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, \nIndonesia, Qatar and Kuwait  Travel is an important element of Mr. Hitchens' work, as \nhis reporting offers detailed, first-hand accounts of conditions in countries few \nWcstemers have an oppo11unity to visit.  For instance, Mr. Hitchens traveled throughout \nIran to prepare \"Tran's Waiting Game\" (July 2005 Vanity Fair)_  He visited Tehran, Qom, \nand Mashhad to gain a sense oflife under Iran's theocratic government.  Tn researching \n\"Afghanistan's Dangerous Bet\" (November 2004 Vanity Fair), Mr. Hitchens ventured \nfrom Kabul to the pr(1vincial capital of Heral to witness the rnn-up to Afghanistan's first \ndemocratic elections from different vantage points_  Mr. Hitchens visited Qatar to report \non its relatively free society, a report in which he devoted much attention to Qatar-based \nmedia outlet Al Jazeera (The Maverick Kingdom, December 2002 Vanity Fair).  While \ntraveling, Mr. Hitchens communicates regularly by telephone and email with colleagues, \neditors, and sources in the United States. \n173.  Because of the nature of his communications with people in the Middle \nEast, the identities of those with whom he communicates, and the subject matter of his \nonline research, Mr. Hitchens has a well-founded belief that his communications are \nbeing intercepted by the NSA under the Program,  Mr. Hitchens believes that free and \nopen communication with his sources is an essential element ofhis work as a journalist. \nGiven the sensitive nature of his work, Mr. Hitchens must assure some of his sources that \ntheir communications iu-e kept in strict confidentiality.  The Program unde1mines Mr. \nHitchens' ability to make that assurance.  As a result, individuals are less forthcoming in \ntheir conversations with him, and may cut off communications completely.  In addition, \nthe likelihood that Mr. Hitchens' international communications are being intercepted by \n52 \n\n2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW   Doc # 1-2   Filed 01/17/06   Pg 3 of 12    Pg ID 3\nthe NSA under the spying program impinges his own ability to communicate freely and \ncandidly wi!h his sources and others, to the detriment of his effectiveness as ;m \ninvestigative journalist. \nTara McKelvcy \n174.  Plaintiff Tara McKelvey is a senior editor at The American Prospect \nand a contributing editor to Marie Claire.  Her a1iicles have appeared in those two \nmagazines as well as in The Nation, USA Today, Chicago Tiibunc, and The New York \nTimes. \n175.  Ms. McKelvey has written extensively about the Midd.le East, including \narticles about Iraqi detainees held in United States custody, about women's issues in Iraq, \nand about the United States military in Iraq.  She is working on a book about U.S. legal \nefforts to fight torture and is editing an upcoming anthology about women and torture. \n176.  Communicating with individuals in Iraq, Jordan, and Syria via \ntelephone and email is a vital part of Ms. McKelvey's work as a journalist.  Since \nOctober 2004, Ms. McKclvey regularly emails people in Iraq and Jordan as part of her \nresearch.  For example, she made frequent calls to individuals in Iraq, Jordan, and Syria \nduring November and December 2004 and January, November, and December 2005.  Ms. \nMcKelvey's sources in the Middle Easl include individuals working for the United Stales \nmilitary, Iraqi soldiers, nongovernmental agencies, bankers, school administrators, \njournalists, activists, human-rights workers, and others. \n177.  Among Ms. McKelvey's many sources in the Middle East arc \nindividuals she believes are likely to have been the targets of United States government \nsurveillance because they have heen anested or investigated by United States or coalition \n53 \n\n2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW   Doc # 1-2   Filed 01/17/06   Pg 4 of 12    Pg ID 4\nforces, have been suspected of aiding insurgents, have ties to the former Iraqi regime, or \nare critical oflhe United States presence in Iraq. \n178.  For example, in December 2004, for an article for The Ameiican \nProspect, Ms. l'vfcKelvey interviewed hy telephone Khadeja Vassen in B<1ghdad.  Yasscn \nwas a ranking member of the Baalh Party and is the sister of fonner vice president Taha \nYassin Ramadan, who in turn was included in the United States military's playing card \ndeck of!he 55 most wanted Iraqis.  Vassen had her house raided by United States .forces \nin 2003 and was thereafter arrested. \n179.  Also in December 2004, for an article for The American Prospect, Ms. \nMcKelvey interviewed Saja, an engineer in her thirties, by telephone at her home in \nDamascus.  Ms. McKclvcy also emailed her.  Saja is, according to an American \nspokesman for coalition forces in Iraq, believed to be a fonner mistress of Saddam \nHussein. \n180.  As part of her journalistic research, Ms. McKelvey visits numerous \nwebsites hosted in the Middle East that include aggressive anti-American propaganda. \n181.  Because of her journalistic c.ontacts with individuals in Iraq who have \nbeen arrested or investigated by United States or coalition forces, who have been \nsuspected of aiding insurgents, who have tics to the fonner Iraqi regime, or who are \ncritical of the United States presence in Iraq, Ms. McKelvcy has a well-founded belief \nthat her international communications arc being intercepted by the NSA under !he \nProgram. \n182.  The Program substantially impairs Ms. McKelvey's ability to \ncommunicate openly with sources in the Middle East that are essential to her work as a \n54 \n\n2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW   Doc # 1-2   Filed 01/17/06   Pg 5 of 12    Pg ID 5\njoumalist.  Many of Ms. McKclvey's most important sources have spoken to her in the \npast only with greal trepidation: they fear that other Iraqis will kill them for speaking \nwith an American and, at the same time, they foar being arrested (in some cases, re \narrested) by United States or coalition forces who suspect them of being involved in \ninsurgent activities.  Ms. McXelvey believes that the Program is diminishing the \nwillingness of her sources to communicate with her and may deter them from \ncommunicating with her altogether for fear that their communications may be \nintercepted. \nBarnett R.

Because of the nature of Professor Rubin's communications, and the \nidentities and locations of those with whom he communicates, Professor Rubin has a \nwell-founded belief that his communications are being intercepted by the NSA under the \nProgram. \n191.  Professor Rubin believes that free and open ctimrnunication with \nindividuals in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle Easl and Asia is essential to his \nwork as a scholar.  A large part of Professor Rubin's work involves exchanging ideas and \n58 \n\n2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW   Doc # 1-2   Filed 01/17/06   Pg 9 of 12    Pg ID 9\ninfonnation with people in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East and Asia.  The \nideas are sometimes controversial and the information is sometimes sensitive.  Pro ressor \nRubin believes that the Program inhibits the free exchange of controversial ideas and \nsensitive infom1ation and thereby compromises his ability lo engage in scholarship and lo \nwork collaboratively with individuals in Afghanistan and elsewhere in lhe Middle East \nand Asia. \nCAUSES 01<' ACTION \n192.  The Program violates plaintiffs' free speech and associational rights \nguaranteed by the First Amendment. \n193.  The Program violates plaintiffs' privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth \nAmendment. \n194.  The Program violates the principle of separation of powers because it \nwas authorized by President Bush in excess of his Executive authority under Article 11 of \nthe United States Constitution and is contrary to limits imposed by Congress. \n195.  The Program violates the Administrative Procedures Act because the \nNSA's actions Lmder the Pmgram exceed statutory authority and .limitations imposed by \nCongress through PISA and Title III; are not otherwise in accordance with law; arc \ncontrary lo conslilulional 1ight; and are taken without observance of procedures required \nby law. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE plaintiffs respectfully requests that the Court: \n1.  Declare that the Program is unconstitutional under the First and Fourth \nAmendments; \n59 \n\n-\n2:06-cv-10204-ADT-RSW   Doc # 1-2   Filed 01/17/06   Pg 10 of 12    Pg ID 10\n2.
