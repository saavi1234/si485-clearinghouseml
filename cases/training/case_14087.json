    "summary": "<p>On August 14, 2014, a number of prisoners in Louisiana state prisons filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 against the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest attorneys, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that, despite being found not guilty by reason of insanity of criminal offenses, they were still being incarcerated in Louisiana prisons. The named plaintiffs claimed that their continued imprisonment violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights under the Due Process Clause, the Americans with Disabilities Act (&ldquo;ADA&rdquo;), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (&ldquo;Section 504&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>The named plaintiffs were all found not guilty by reason of insanity during their criminal trials, and they were all committed by the courts to the Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (&ldquo;ELMHS&rdquo;), which ran a state mental health facility. Nevertheless, at the time of the complaint, all named plaintiffs still remained incarcerated in state prisons, despite the fact that no other criminal charges had been filed against them. The plaintiffs claimed that by continuing to incarcerate them, the state discriminated against them on the basis of their mental illness and denied them appropriate mental health services.</p>\r\n<p>After the plaintiffs filed an amended class-action complaint, the Judge Shelly Dick granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. 2014 WL 7334911. Judge Dick dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; Fourteenth Amendment claims, which sought monetary damages against the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services on sovereign immunity grounds. Judge Dick, however, denied the defendants&rsquo; motion as to all other respects.</p>\r\n<p>The court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification on December 22, 2014, finding that numerosity was not satisfied because the putative class consisted of only thirty-six individuals. 2014 WL 7338846. The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint on January 26, 2015, and a third amended complaint on May 13, 2015. Discovery and litigation continued, and on February 3, 2016, this case was consolidated with Advocacy Center v. Kliebert (Docket No. 3:15-cv-00751). 2016 WL 3660497.</p>\r\n<p>After several months of settlement discussions, on July 18, 2016, the court dismissed the case without prejudice to the right to reopen it within sixty days if the parties did not settle. On September 2, 2016, the parties reported that they had reached a settlement, moving jointly to reopen the case for the purpose of entering that agreement as a court order. The court granted the motion and approved the settlement on November 16, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>The terms of the settlement agreement applied to &ldquo;All individuals who, after having been found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity or Incompetent to Stand Trial are remanded by a court to a mental health facility for treatment.&rdquo; The settlement required the defendants to maintain a record of all such persons, conduct prompt behavioral health assessments after the court orders commitment or inpatient treatment, admit such persons currently on a waitlist to a mental health facility or appropriate program, create a procedure for expedited admission of such persons to the appropriate facilities in the event of an emergency need, maintain pre- and post-admissions procedures for ensuring appropriate placement of such persons, work to develop less constricting and new placement options, and report back to the plaintiffs on a monthly basis. The settlement agreement also awarded the plaintiffs attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in the amount of $466,000 and possible future fees related to the execution of this settlement agreement. The agreement was set to terminate after four continuous years of the defendants&rsquo; substantial compliance with its terms.</p>\r\n<p>On November 16, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for continued reporting and jurisdiction over the settlement agreement and notice of negotiations related to a supplemental agreement. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants had been unable to maintain substantial compliance with the settlement agreement for four continuous years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion on December 3, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2021, the plaintiffs circulated a proposed draft of a supplement to the settlement agreement, which outlined specific actions to assist the defendants in returning to compliance with the settlement agreement and the development of supporting documentation. The parties then negotiated the terms of this proposed supplement, but the plaintiffs asserted that the defendants&rsquo; counter proposal made clear that they had no interest in negotiating a supplemental settlement agreement in good faith.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs, therefore, filed a motion to reopen discovery and to show cause why the defendants should not be held in contempt on June 12, 2021. In opposition, the defendants argued that they should not be held in contempt because of unforeseeable and unprecedented issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and because they had been in substantial compliance for 3.5 years until the Center for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidelines for congregate settings, as well as local quarantine protocols. On September 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion. 2021 WL 4429458. The court granted limited discovery on the purported non-compliance with Paragraphs 6, 8, 9, 15 of the settlement agreement and the reasons for such non-compliance. All post-judgment discovery was ordered to be completed by December 1, 2021. The court held that it would not reach the issue of whether the defendants should be held in contempt.</p>\r\n<p>On April 26, 2023, the parties filed a joint motion for entry of a supplemental stipulated order, which the court granted on May 2, 2023. The court ruled that the supplemental stipulated order should supplement the settlement agreement, and that the settlement would remain in full force and effect until the defendants maintained substantial compliance with the supplemental stipulated order for a period of two years. Some terms of the supplemental stipulated order included that the defendants would need to demonstrate for three consecutive months that it met the following goals:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>No incompetent individuals or not guilty by reason of insanity clients had waited longer than thirty days for transfer to ELMHS,</li>\r\n<li>90% of incompetent individuals or persons deemed not guilty by reason of insanity were admitted to ELMHS within two business days or fifteen calendar days, and</li>\r\n<li>90% of Behavioral Health Assessments of incompetent individuals and persons deemed not guilty by reason of insanity occur within five (calendar days of receipt of an order for inpatient treatment or commitment.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Section X of the supplemental stipulated order provides that within 30 days of entry of the Supplemental Stipulated Order, the plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel was to provide the defendants&rsquo; counsel with an itemized accounting of attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs incurred in connection with obtaining the defendants&rsquo; compliance with the settlement. The plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel provided their itemized accounting on May 31, 2023, requesting recovery of $278,479 in fees and costs. The defendants did not object to any of the items in the plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel&rsquo;s accounting. More than six months after the plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel submitted their request for payment, the defendants had neither paid the amount due nor identified a specific time when payment would be made. On January 2, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for entry of a judgment enforcing the fee provision of the supplemental stipulated order. This case remains ongoing. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Ryan Kasami).2 Plaintiff DRLA is a private, \n                                                           \n1 Formerly the Advocacy Center. \n2 These individuals are consolidated plaintiffs, see ECF No. 65 and ECF No. 150, who were either found \nincompetent to proceed or NGRI and were awaiting mental health care treatment placement at the time of filing. \nThese individual plaintiffs’ criminal cases do not remain in the same procedural posture as they were at the time of \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 208-1    11/16/20   Page 2 of 7\nfederally funded, non-profit corporation, designated by Louisiana to serve as the State’s protection \nand advocacy system for persons with disabilities and is a party in the instant consolidated case as \nan associational plaintiff.  \nOn  November  16,  2016,  this  Court  signed  a  Settlement  Agreement3  to  resolve  the \nconsolidated actions alleging that Defendants Rebekah Gee4 and Louisiana Department of Health \n(LDH)5 were failing to promptly provide requisite mental health placements for people found \nincompetent to stand trial (hereinafter “incompetent”) or people found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity (hereinafter “NGRI”). The Settlement Agreement provides for, inter alia:  \n•  a procedure for coordinating with criminal courts regarding orders related to \nincompetent and NGRI individuals; \n•  Behavioral Health Assessments (BHAs)  conducted by a psychiatrist, licensed \npsychologist,  or  District  Forensic  Coordinators  (DFCs),  within  a  specified \ntimeframe, for NGRI and incompetent individuals to assess the acuity of mental \nillness and addiction problems; \n•  timelines for transferring incompetent and NGRI individuals from jail to mental \nhealth placements including expedited admission of individuals with emergency \nmental health needs, as determined by the BHA; \n•  intake and post-admission procedures to ensure appropriate treatment placements;  \n                                                           \nfiling, but as plaintiffs with standing at the time of entry of the Settlement Agreement, they continue as plaintiffs in \nefforts to enforce and maintain the terms of the Settlement Agreement. \n3 ECF No. 200. \n4 Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for the automatic substitution of a public officer’s \nsuccessor “when a public officer who is a party in an official capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold \noffice while the action is pending.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). Accordingly, Dr. Courtney N. Phillips, who is serving as \nthe successor Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health since April 2020, is automatically substituted for Dr. \nRebekah Gee in the caption. \n5 Formerly Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.  \n2 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 208-1    11/16/20   Page 3 of 7\n•  development of less restrictive placement options for NGRI and incompetent \nindividuals; \n•  maintenance  of  lists  and  regular  reporting  to  verify  compliance  regarding \nincompetent and NGRI individuals in jails awaiting mental health placements, and \ntimeliness of transfer and BHAs.  \n  This Court “retain[s] jurisdiction to enforce this Settlement Agreement until this matter is \ndismissed  after  four  (4)  continuous  years  of  Defendants’  substantial  compliance  with  this \nSettlement  Agreement.”6  The  parties  agree  that  Defendants  have  been  unable  to  maintain \nsubstantial compliance with the Settlement Agreement including providing BHAs and placements \nof incompetent and NGRI individuals within the timelines required by Paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 of \nthe Settlement Agreement due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.7  \nThe parties also agree that the COVID-19 pandemic was and remains the major driver of \nthe failure to maintain substantial compliance with the Settlement Agreement. At the beginning of \nthe pandemic, in March and April 2020, Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (ELMHS) \nsuffered a widespread infection from COVID-19 of nearly 20% of the patient population. Based \non information received from Defendants on November 6, 2020, COVID-19 caused the death of \neleven (11) patients, just under 2% of the patient population at ELMHS. Jails entered periods of \nlockdown restricting visitor access and halting transports. This combination of factors made \nprevious systems of patient evaluation and treatment of people found incompetent and NGRI \ndangerously impractical and caused significant increases to the wait list of individuals awaiting \ntransfer to a mental health placement. The March 2020 reports8 from Defendants reflected a wait \n                                                           \n6 ECF No. 200 at 18, Para. 50.  \n7 ECF No. 200 at 7–8. \n8 Exhibit 1, Redacted Summary Sheet of March 2020 Report. \n3 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 208-1    11/16/20   Page 4 of 7\nlist of sixteen (16) people found incompetent and one (1) person found NGRI incarcerated and \nawaiting transfer when ELMHS stopped accepting admissions in mid-March. By April 15, 2020, \nDefendants reported there were twenty-two (22) people found incompetent and one (1) person \nfound NGRI incarcerated in local jails awaiting mental health treatment.  The overwhelming \nmajority of these people had already waited longer than the 15-day time limit required by \nParagraph 9 of the Settlement Agreement.  In fact, most wait times on the April 15, 2020 wait list \nexceeded the thirty (30) calendar day limit provided for “unusual and exigent circumstances” under \nParagraph 9 of the Settlement Agreement.    \nIn mid-April 2020, Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) informed Plaintiffs' counsel \nthat admissions to ELMHS and other community placements had been frozen in response to the \nunprecedented public health crisis caused by COVID-19. LDH proposed a temporary stay of the \nSettlement Agreement. Plaintiffs requested LDH provide information related to the development \nof a plan to comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement and supporting documentation \nconsidering the conditions created by COVID-19.9 LDH responded with some, but not all of the \nrequested information.10 After further discussion, Plaintiffs re-urged the request for a proactive \nremedial plan from LDH for returning to substantial compliance with the Settlement Agreement, \nand requested outstanding and additional information in July 2020.11  \nELMHS reported that admissions began again in August 2020 on a limited basis. Despite \nthe resumption of admissions to ELMHS, the wait list remains extensive. The September 2020 \nreports12 provided by LDH included fifty-two (52) people found incompetent and three (3) people \n                                                           \n9 Exhibit 2, May 20, 2020 Letter to LDH.  \n10 Exhibit 3, June 5, 2020 Letter to DRLA and MacArthur Justice Center.  \n11 Exhibit 4, July 15, 2020 Letter to LDH.  \n12 Exhibit 5, Redacted Summary Sheet of September 2020 Report.  \n4 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 208-1    11/16/20   Page 5 of 7\nfound NGRI on the wait list.13 Forty-five (45) out of the fifty-two (52) people found incompetent \nand all three (3) people found NGRI had been waiting over fifteen (15) days from the date a court \norder was received.14 The September 2020 reports also list people who were placed off the wait \nlist. Twenty nine (29) people found incompetent were placed off the wait list, and twenty-five (25) \nof these people had been on the list for longer than fifteen (15) days from the date a court order \nwas received. All three (3) people found NGRI who were placed off the wait list also waited longer \nthan fifteen (15) days from the date a court order was received.  \nTo be clear, Plaintiffs are not and have never advocated for LDH to abandon testing and \ndistancing measures in favor of clearing and preventing treatment wait lists. However, new \nprocedures must be developed, including determining mechanisms for providing treatment to \npeople found incompetent and people found NGRI in safer non-congregate settings and detailed \nprotocols for providing treatment during peaks of the pandemic.  \nAdditionally, LDH reported that BHAs resumed in July 2020. However, details of how \nBHAs are being conducted, and how DFCs are working around the issues of jail closures have not \nbeen resolved.15 In order to come into compliance with the Settlement Agreement, LDH must \ndevelop detailed protocols with local jails for how to determine the acuity of people found \n                                                           \n13 The September 2020 report for individuals found incompetent included a total of eighty-one (81) names, and \ntwenty-nine (29) of these people were placed off the wait list. The September 2020 report for individuals found \nNGRI included a total of six (6) names, and three (3) of these people were placed off the wait list. \n14 As raised elsewhere, the acuity of people on the waitlist is not being assessed consistently through BHAs \nincluding a period of time when BHAs ceased completely. The lack of consistent BHAs raises the possibility that \nDefendants may also be consistently noncompliant with the 2-business day timeline for emergency admissions \nrequired by Paragraph 8 of the Settlement Agreement. This possibility is supported by the September 2020 report of \nthose found incompetent where even among those who did receive BHAs, all six (6) individuals labelled \n“emergency admit” waited beyond the 2-business day timeline as of the print date of the report (October 6, 2020). \n15 See, e.g., Exhibit 6, list of jails reflecting limitations in DFC access.  \n5 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 208-1    11/16/20   Page 6 of 7\nincompetent and people found NGRI in light of COVID-19 conditions including lockdowns, and \nprovide timely treatment based on the level of acuity.  \nGiven the wait lists and continued inconsistencies in providing BHAs, LDH has not been \nin substantial compliance with the provisions of the Settlement Agreement since March 2020. \nBecause Defendants have been unable to maintain substantial compliance due to the current \nunprecedented COVID-19 health crisis, the parties agree that the reporting provisions of the \nSettlement Agreement and this Court’s jurisdiction should not terminate on November 16, 2020. \nThe advent of COVID-19 was an unprecedented and unanticipated global event. Because \nthe parties agree that Defendants have been unable to maintain substantial compliance with the \nSettlement Agreement, rather than involve the Court in contentious litigation, the parties are \ncontinuing negotiations to reach an agreement to supplement the Settlement Agreement. The \nparties anticipate that this supplemental agreement will outline immediate steps that LDH can take \ntowards achieving substantial compliance with the Settlement Agreement in light of the conditions \ncreated by COVID-19.  \nThe Plaintiffs therefore request that this Court continue the reporting provisions and the \nCourt’s jurisdiction over the enforcement of the original Settlement Agreement beyond November \n16, 2020, until such time an agreement may be reached by the parties or negotiations reach an \nimpasse requiring the intervention of the Court.   \n                  \n   \n6 \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 208-1    11/16/20   Page 7 of 7\nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n            /s/ Ronald Lospennato     \n            Ronald K.

A hearing on class certification was held on December 9, \n2014.  For the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion is hereby denied. \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe  Plaintiffs  are  Louisiana  residents  with  mental  illness  who  have  been \nadjudicated by various state courts “Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity” (“NGRI”).  The \nPlaintiffs contend that, despite having been found NGRI, and subsequently ordered \ncommitted to a mental health facility, they remain incarcerated. The Plaintiffs recount \nand offer evidence that, after having been adjudicated NGRI and ordered committed to \n                                            \n1 Rec. Doc. 2. \n2 Rec. Doc. 9. \n1 \n \n\nthe Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (“ELMHS”), Plaintiffs remain incarcerated \nin  Louisiana  correctional  facilities  for  months  while  awaiting  bed  space  at  ELMHS.  \nPlaintiffs move for class certification under Rule 23(a) and 23(b) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, and propose the following as their class definition: \n \n[A]ll  persons  in  Louisiana  who  are  being,  or  may  be  in  the  future, \nincarcerated in Louisiana correctional facilities after a finding of NGRI and \ntheir commitment to a mental health facility pursuant to La. Code Crim. \nProc. Art. 657.3 \n \nII.   CLASS CERTIFICATION \nThe  party  seeking  class  certification  bears  the  burden  of  proving  all  four \nrequirements of Rule 23(a); namely, numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate \nrepresentation.4  In addition to meeting the requirements of Rule 23(a), a class must \nalso meet at least one element of Rule 23(b).  In this case, the Plaintiffs rely on Rule \n23(b)(2) which provides that a class action may be maintained if “the party opposing the \nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby \nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect \nto the class as a whole”. \n“The class action is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by \nand on behalf of the individual named parties only’.”5  Because class actions are the \nexception and not the rule, “[a] district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the \nRule  23  prerequisites  before  certifying  a  class”.6    The  elements  of  commonality, \n                                            \n3  Rec. Doc. 2-1, p. 2. \n4 Berger v. Compaq Computer Corp., 257 F.3d 475, 479-80 (5th Cir. 2001). \n5 Wal-mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2550 (2011)(quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 99 S.Ct. \n2557 (1979)). \n6 Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 740 (5th Cir. 1996). \n2 \n \n\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation are not in dispute.7  The Defendants oppose \nclass certification on the grounds that the proposed class is not so numerous as to \nmake joinder impractical.8 \nAccording to the evidence offered in support of the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \nCertification, as of March 28, 2014, the Department of Health and Hospitals (“DHH”) \nhad eleven persons who had been adjudicated NGRI and committed to ELMHS, but \nwho remained incarcerated while awaiting bed space.9  The evidence further indicates \nthat, in the twelve months ending in April of 2014, twenty-five individuals had been \nadjudicated NGRI and ordered committed to ELMHS but remained incarcerated for \nseveral  months  before  being  admitted  to  ELMHS  for  mental  health  treatment.10  \nPlaintiffs contend, and the Defendants do not dispute that, the population of individuals \nwho  are  adjudicated  NGRI  and  ordered  committed  to  a  mental  health  facility  is \nchanging.    Stated  differently,  the  proposed  class  of  plaintiffs  is  ever-changing  and \nremains fluid. \nIII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \n  In this case, while the putative class is a fluctuating population, according to the \nPlaintiffs’ evidence, only thirty-six individuals meet the class definition.11  For purposes \nof the numerosity requirement, “[t]he proper focus is not on numbers alone, but on \nwhether joinder of all members is practicable in view of the numerosity of the class and \n                                            \n7 The Court is mindful of its obligation to “conduct a rigorous analysis to determine whether the plaintiffs \nhave met the Rule 23 requirements”. Castano, 84 F.3rd at 740.  After close examination of the pleadings \nand evidence, the Court is satisfied that the elements of commonality, typicality, and adequacy of \nrepresentation have been met. \n8 Rec. Doc. 9.  \n9 Rec. Doc. 32-1, p. 6. Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 2. \n10 Rec. Doc. 32-1, pp. 4-5. Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 1. \n11 Rec. Doc. 32-1, pp. 4-6. Plaintiffs’ Exhibits 1 and 2. \n3 \n \n\nall other relevant factors”.12  Other factors which are relevant to the “numerosity” inquiry \ninclude the geographical dispersion of the class, the ease with which class members \nmay be identified, the nature of the action, and the size of each plaintiff’s claim.13  Not \nsurprisingly, there are no definitive instructions or guidelines in terms of the number of \npurported class members required to satisfy the numerosity requirement.14 \nThe Fifth Circuit instructs that: “[T]he number of members in a proposed class is \nnot determinative of whether joinder is impracticable.”15  The Fifth Circuit has further \ncounseled that “courts must not focus on sheer numbers alone”.16 The crux of the \nnumerosity inquiry is the ease and practicability of joinder of party plaintiffs.17 \nIn  Garcia  v.  Gloor,18  the  Fifth  Circuit  affirmed  the  District  Court’s  denial  of \ncertification  of  a  class  comprised  of  only  thirty-one  persons  whose  identity  and \naddresses were readily ascertainable and who lived in a compact geographical area.19 \nIn this case, the evidence indicates that once an offender is adjudicated NGRI and \nordered committed, DHH captures and tracks the following information: the offender’s \nname, age, race, case number, committing Parish, committing offense, date of NGRI \nadjudication, and date of admission to a mental health facility.20  Up until the point that \nthe  offender  is  admitted  to  a  mental  health  facility,  DHH  places  the  offender  on  a \n                                            \n12 Phillips v. Joint Legislative Committee, 637 F.2d 1014, 1022 (5th Cir. 1981); Zeidman v. J. Ray \nMcDermott & Company, 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981). \n13 Id. \n14 Wright and Miller 7A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. Section 1762 (3rd Ed.). \n15 Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. 1999). \n16 Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 868 n.11 (5th Cir. 2000). \n17 “The basic question is practicability of joinder, not number of interested persons per se. Practicability of \njoinder depends on size of the class, ease of identifying its members and determining their addresses, \nfacility of making service on them if joined and their geographic dispersion.” Garcia v. Gloor, 618 F.2d \n264, 267 (5th Cir. 1980). \n18 618 F.2d 264 (5th Cir. 1980). \n19 Id. at 267. \n20 Rec. Doc. 32-1, Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 1. \n4 \n \n\n“waitlist.”21 There was no evidence that DHH failed to know the name and whereabouts \nof any offender having been adjudicated NGRI and ordered committed.  In short there \nwas no evidence that the offenders awaiting commitment were not known to DHH, or \nthat NGRI committed offenders’ whereabouts were unknown.  The only evidence before \nthe Court demonstrated that the identity and whereabouts of putative plaintiffs is readily \nascertainable.    \nPlaintiffs cite J.D. v. Nagin22 which the Court finds distinguishable.  Although the \nproposed class contains future members, unlike the proposed class in J.D. v Nagin, the \nfuture  Plaintiffs  in  this  case  are  easily  identifiable.  Once  adjudicated  NGRI  and  a \ncommitment order is entered, if the offender is not immediately placed, the offender’s \nname goes on the DHH waitlist. Thus, future Plaintiffs are easily identified. Likewise, \nfuture Plaintiffs are easily located by virtue of the fact that the committing Parish, ie. the \nparish where the offender is incarcerated, is also identified on the DHH waitlist.  In this \ncase, the population of putative plaintiffs is continually changing; however, that fact \nalone does not, in the Court’s view, present an undue obstacle to joinder. The mere fact \nthat the population of potential plaintiffs will evolve during the pendency of litigation \ndoes not render their future joinder impractical.  The Fifth Circuit cautions the need to \nread Rule 23(a) liberally in the context of civil rights suits where plaintiffs seek injunctive \nrelief on behalf of past, present, and future class members.23 The Court finds that this \ngoal can be accomplished by crafting a process whereby DHH is required to disclose \nthe names and locations of offenders placed on the mental health waitlist to Plaintiffs \nperiodically for the purpose of facilitating joinder. \n                                            \n21 Rec.

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Plaintiffs, Brandon Cooper, Louis Davenport, Ron Gatlin, Kenny Swatt, Stephen \nZeringue, and William Pitzer are individuals who have been diagnosed with mental illness and \nfound Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI) of a criminal offense but, despite that finding, \ncontinue to be incarcerated in correctional facilities in Louisiana. They bring this civil rights \naction  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and  federal  statutes  barring  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \ndisability, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly-situated persons. Plaintiffs seek a \ndeclaratory  judgment  and  injunctive  relief  to  enjoin  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  and \nprocedures, executed under color of state law, which have caused them to be deprived of their \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 2 of 16\nliberty due to their disabilities, and denied necessary mental health treatment. Plaintiffs and the \nclass they represent contend that these policies, practices, and procedures violate their rights \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nTitle  II  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  of 1990 (“ADA”), and  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”).  \nII.  JURISDICTION \n2.    This Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343, in \nthat this is an action arising under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nSection 504, and the ADA.   \n3.    Venue  is  appropriate  in  this  court  under  28  U.S.C.  §1391(b)(2)  because  the \nDefendants reside in this district. \nIII.  PARTIES \n4.  Plaintiff BRANDON COOPER is a 34-year old man with mental illness. On \nFebruary 14, 2014, the St. Tammany Parish District Court found Mr. Cooper not guilty by reason \nof insanity for two counts of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and committed him to Eastern \nLouisiana Mental Health System (“ELMHS”), which is a state mental health facility in Jackson, \nLouisiana. Mr. Cooper has been continuously incarcerated in the St. Tammany Parish Jail since \nthe date of that finding. No other criminal charges have been filed against him. \n5.  Plaintiff LOUIS DAVENPORT is a 25-year old man old with mental illness. On \nApril 23, 2014, the Jefferson Parish District Court found Mr. Davenport not guilty by reason of \ninsanity for one count of battery on a correctional facility employee, and committed him to \nELMHS. Mr. Davenport has been continuously incarcerated in the Jefferson Parish Correctional \nCenter since the date of that finding. No other criminal charges have been filed against him. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 3 of 16\n6.  Plaintiff RON GATLIN is a 25-year old man with mental illness. On March 19, \n2014, the Jefferson Parish District Court found Mr. Gatlin not guilty by reason of insanity for one \ncount  of  obscenity,  and  committed  him  to  ELMHS.  Mr.  Gatlin  has  been  continuously \nincarcerated in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center since the date of that finding.  No other \ncriminal charges have been filed against him. \n7.  Plaintiff KENNY SWATT is a 25-year old man with mental illness. On April 23, \n2014, the Jefferson Parish District Court found Mr. Swatt not guilty by reason of insanity for one \ncount of aggravated battery, and committed him to ELMHS. Mr. Swatt has been continuously \nincarcerated in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center since the date of that finding.  No other \ncriminal charges have been filed against him. \n8.  Plaintiff STEPHEN ZERINGUE is a 31-year old man with mental illness. On \nMarch 19, 2014, the Jefferson Parish District Court found him not guilty by reason of insanity for \none  count  of  aggravated  arson,  and  committed  him  to  ELMHS.  Mr.  Zeringue  has  been \ncontinuously incarcerated in  the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center since the date of that \nfinding. No other criminal charges have been filed against him. \n9.  Plaintiff WILLIAM PITZER is a 57-year old man with mental illness. On April \n16, 2014, the Jefferson Parish District Court found him not guilty by reason of insanity for two \ncounts of auto theft and one count of theft, and committed him to ELMHS.  Mr. Pitzer has been \ncontinuously incarcerated in  the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center since the date of that \nfinding. No other criminal charges have been filed against him.  \n10.  Defendant KATHY KLIEBERT is the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of \nHealth and Hospitals (“DHH”).  Pursuant to La. R.S. 36:254, she is responsible for the oversight, \nsupervision and control of DHH and its divisions and is ultimately responsible for ensuring that \nDHH’s services for people with disabilities are provided in conformance with federal law. The \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 4 of 16\nCommunity Forensic Coordinators program, which monitors and provides services to persons \nfound NGRI, is located within her Department. She is being sued in her official capacity only. \n11.   Defendant,  LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  AND  HOSPITALS \n(DHH) is the state agency that operates Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (ELMHS). \nELMHS maintains a waiting list for the services it provides to persons with mental illness who \nhave been ordered to ELMHS to receive mental health treatment. DHH receives federal financial \nassistance and is a public entity as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) (B). \nIV.   CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n12.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. The class consists of all persons \nin Louisiana who are being, or who may be in the future, incarcerated in Louisiana correctional \nfacilities after a finding of NGRI and their commitment to a mental health facility pursuant to La. \nCode Crim. P. art. 657. \n13.  The number of persons in the class is so numerous and in such fluctuation that \njoinder of all of them is impractical. There are scores of individuals throughout the state of \nLouisiana who have been or will be found NGRI and committed to a mental health facility, but \nwho remain or will remain incarcerated in a parish jail, often for months at a time.  \n14.  The questions of law and fact raised in this case are common to both the named \nPlaintiffs and the class as defined above. These common questions of law and fact include \nwhether it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and is unlawful discrimination on the basis of disability to incarcerate individuals \nafter a finding of NGRI and an order that they be committed to a mental health facility, pursuant \nto La. Code Crim. P. art. 657, even though no other criminal charges have been filed against \nthem.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 5 of 16\n15.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the proposed class. As with \nPlaintiffs,  the  class  of  individuals  they  represent  have  been  or  will  be  found  NGRI  but \nnevertheless remain incarcerated in parish jails, even though no other criminal charges have been \nfiled against them. \n16.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, have no \ninterests that are antagonistic to the class, and seek relief that will benefit all members of the \nclass. Plaintiffs are represented by counsel experienced in the prosecution of class actions.  \n17.  The Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class, making injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate for the class as a whole. \nV.  STATUTORY SCHEME \n18.  La. R.S. 14:14 states that an individual charged with a criminal offense is exempt \nfrom criminal responsibility for his behavior when “the circumstances indicate that because of a \nmental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and \nwrong with reference to the conduct in question.” \n19.  La. R.S. 28:2(20) defines a mentally ill person as “any person with a psychiatric \ndisorder which has substantial adverse effects on his ability to function and who requires care \nand treatment.” \n20.  When the defendant enters a plea of not guilty and NGRI, the court may appoint a \nSanity Commission, as provided in La. Code Crim. P. art. 644, to examine the defendant to \ndetermine whether he or she was “insane” at the time of the offense. La. Code Crim. P. arts. 650–\n652.  \n21.  A  finding  of  NGRI  means  that  the  defendant  has  committed  the  acts  that \nconstitute the crime; however, the defense has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 6 of 16\nthe defendant was insane at the time the acts were committed and thus cannot be held legally \nresponsible. La. Code Crim. P. art. 651. \n22.  La. Code Crim. P. art. 654 provides that if the defendant is found not guilty by \nreason of insanity in a non-capital case, the court shall remand him to the parish jail or to a \nprivate mental  institution approved by the court and promptly hold a hearing to determine \nwhether the defendant can be released. When a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is \nreturned in a capital case, the court shall commit the defendant to a state or private mental \ninstitution for care, custody, and treatment. \n23.  Under  the  United  State  Constitution,  an  insanity  acquittee’s  liberty  may  be \ncurtailed only upon a finding that he is both dangerous and mentally ill. However, implicit in the \nNGRI acquittal is a finding that the defendant is mentally ill. Therefore, at the initial hearing \nfollowing an NGRI finding, the only issue before the court in determining whether the acquittee \nshould be released or committed, is whether the acquittee is dangerous.  \n24.  Under Louisiana’s statutory scheme, after a contradictory hearing, and considering \nthe Sanity Commission’s findings, the court may order the individual’s release, place him on \nconditional release, or commit him. La. Code Crim. P. art. 657.1. \n25.  If the court determines that the defendant cannot be released without danger to \nhimself or others, the court shall order him committed to a proper state mental institution or to a \nprivate mental institution approved by the court for custody, care, and treatment. La. Code Crim. \nP. art. 654. \n26.  Even if a defendant has been committed under La. Code Crim. P. art. 654, as a \nresult of having been found dangerous and presumed mentally ill based on the finding of NGRI, \nthe acquittee may later apply for discharge or conditional release.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 7 of 16\n27.  The insanity acquittee or the superintendent of the facility in which he or she is \nbeing held may petition the review panel for discharge, which can recommend to the court that \nthe person be discharged conditionally or unconditionally or placed on conditional release, after \nfinding that the acquittee is not a danger to himself or others or is no longer mentally ill.  \nVI.  STATEMENT OF FACTS  \na.   Plaintiff Brandon Cooper  \n28.  Mr. Cooper has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was first hospitalized for \nmental health problems when he was a teenager. He currently receives a monthly injection of the \npsychotropic medication Haldol. \n29.  On or about December 12, 2012, Mr. Cooper was arrested and placed in the St. \nTammany Parish Jail for two counts of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.  \n30.  On April 8, 2013, Mr. Cooper’s public defender filed an application with the St. \nTammany Parish District Court to determine Mr. Cooper’s present mental health condition, and \nhis mental health condition at the time of the alleged offense. Mr. Cooper’s public defender \nadvised the court that he had good reason to believe that Mr. Cooper was not of sound mind and \nunderstanding and was currently insane and insane at the time of the alleged offense; and that \nMr.  Cooper  was  “mentally  defective  or  deficient”  and  unable  to  understand  his  criminal \nproceedings. Mr. Cooper’s public defender asked the court to appoint two physicians to examine \nMr. Cooper with regard to his mental condition. \n31.   On May 9, 2013, the circuit court appointed two physicians to examine Mr. \nCooper, and scheduled a hearing for June 27, 2013 to determine Mr. Cooper’s present mental \ncondition, and his mental condition at the time of the alleged offenses. \n32.  On  February  14,  2014,  the  circuit  court  adjudicated  Mr.  Cooper  NGRI  and \nordered him committed to ELMHS. However, as of today’s date, Mr. Cooper remains in the St. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 8 of 16\nTammany Parish Jail where his mental health treatment is limited to monthly injections of \nHaldol.  \nb.   Plaintiff Louis Davenport \n33.  Mr. Davenport has been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, \nand has been hospitalized for mental health treatment on several occasions.  \n34.  In late 2012 or early 2013, Mr. Davenport was transferred to the Jefferson Parish \nCorrectional Center from the Orleans Parish Prison for allegedly forfeiting a bond issued to him \nby the Jefferson Parish District Court in 2007. On or about March 19, 2013, while suffering from \nuntreated psychosis, Mr. Davenport was accused of committing a battery upon a Jefferson Parish \ncorrectional officer who tried to escort Mr. Davenport out of the jail infirmary.  \n35.   On or about March 22, 2013, Mr. Davenport was transported to ELMHS for a \ncompetency evaluation, at which time the Department of Health and Hospitals reported that Mr. \nDavenport  was  in  a  “floridly  psychotic  state”  and  had  a  “significant  psychosis  and  mood \ndisturbance.” It took the doctors at ELMHS five months to stabilize Mr. Davenport through \nmedication. \n36.  On or about September 19, 2013, Mr. Davenport’s public defender filed a Motion \nfor Mental Examination with the Jefferson Parish District Court to request that the court appoint \nphysicians to evaluate Mr. Davenport to determine if he was insane at the time of his alleged \noffense. The district court ordered a sanity evaluation that same day.  \n37.  On  April  23,  2014,  the  district  court  adjudicated  Mr.  Davenport  NGRI  and \ncommitted him to ELMHS. However, as of today’s date, Mr. Davenport remains in the Jefferson \nParish Correctional Center where his mental health treatment is limited to receiving his daily \npsychotropic medications.  \nc.  Plaintiff Ron Gatlin \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 9 of 16\n38.  Mr. Gatlin has a history of mental illness dating back to his childhood. On or \nabout July 15, 2013, Mr. Gatlin was charged with one count of obscenity for an incident that \noccurred in the Kenner City Jail. Although Mr. Gatlin had been hospitalized for mental health \nproblems just a few months prior to  this offense, he was not receiving any medication or \ntreatment at the time that he was charged with obscenity. \n39.  On or about December 17, 2013, Mr. Gatlin’s public defender filed a motion with \nthe  Jefferson  Parish  District  Court  requesting  the  appointment  of  a  sanity  commission  to \ndetermine whether Mr. Gatlin was insane at the time of the alleged obscenity offense.  \n40.  On March 19, 2014, the district court adjudicated Mr. Gatlin not guilty by reason \nof insanity and committed him to ELMHS. However, as of today’s date, Mr. Gatlin remains in \nthe Jefferson Parish Correctional Center where his mental health treatment is limited to his daily \npsychotropic medications.  \nd.  Plaintiff Kenny Swatt \n  41.  On or about July 1, 2013, Mr. Swatt was arrested for one count of aggravated \nbattery and placed in  the Jefferson Parish  Correctional  Center, where he started to receive \ntreatment for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. \n  42.  On or about September 10, 2013, Mr. Swatt’s public defender filed a motion with \nthe  Jefferson  Parish  District  Court  requesting  the  appointment  of  a  sanity  commission  to \ndetermine whether Mr. Swatt was insane at the time of the alleged offense. The district court \nappointed a sanity commission on September 11, 2013, and ordered the commission to report its \nfindings to the court by November 13, 2013. \n  43.  On April 23, 2014, the district court adjudicated Mr. Swatt not guilty by reason of \ninsanity for one count of aggravated battery and committed him to ELMHS. However, as of \ntoday’s date, Mr. Swatt remains incarcerated in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center where \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 10 of 16\nhis mental health treatment is limited to receiving the medication Haldol. Due to the lack of \ntreatment, Mr. Swatt spends nearly all of his time sleeping and worries that his condition is \ndeteriorating in jail. \ne.  Plaintiff Stephen Zeringue \n  44.   Mr. Zeringue has a lengthy history of mental health problems and psychiatric \ntreatment dating back to his childhood. On or about January 4, 2013, Mr. Zeringue was arrested \nfor one count of aggravated arson and placed in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. \n  45.  On or about March 27, 2013, Mr. Zeringue was found incompetent to stand trial, \nand was remanded to ELMHS to be restored to competency. Mr. Zeringue remained at ELMHS \nfor over five months, and was eventually returned to the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center \naround September 19, 2013. \n  46.   On November 19, 2014, Mr. Zeringue’s public defender filed a motion with the \nJefferson Parish District Court to request the appointment of a sanity commission to determine \nwhether Mr. Zeringue was insane at the time of the alleged offense. The district court appointed a \nsanity commission that same day, and ordered the physicians to report their findings to the court \non January 8, 2014.  \n  47.  On March 19, 2014, the district court found Mr. Zeringue not guilty by reason of \ninsanity and committed him to ELMHS. However, despite this order, Mr. Zeringue remains \nincarcerated in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center where his treatment is limited to oral \npsychotropic medications.  \nf.  Plaintiff William Pitzer  \n  48.  William Pitzer was arrested on or around February 28, 2012 for two counts of \nauto theft and one count of theft. He was initially deemed incompetent to stand trial, and was \nremanded to ELMHS on or around February 20, 2013 to be restored to competency. At the time \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 11 of 16\nof his admission, the physicians at ELMHS described him as psychotic and delusional, and \ndiagnosed him with delusional disorder.  \n  49.  Mr. Pitzer returned to the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center at the end of June \n2013, and on or about July 18, 2013, Mr. Pitzer’s public defender filed a motion to request a \nsanity  commission  to  determine  whether  Mr.  Pitzer  was  insane  at  the  time  of  the  alleged \noffenses.  \n  50.  On April 16, 2014, the Jefferson Parish District Court adjudicated Mr. Pitzer \nNGRI, and committed him to ELMHS. However, Mr. Pitzer remains incarcerated in the Jefferson \nParish Correctional Center where his treatment is limited to oral psychotropic medications. Mr. \nPitzer does not receive any visitors, and passes his time by sleeping through the day. \ng.  Defendants’ Unconstitutional Policies and Practices  \n51.    The  primary  purpose  for  incarcerating  individuals  in  Louisiana  correctional \nfacilities is punishment and pre-trial detention. Such facilities do not have the capacity to provide \nthe mental health treatment to individuals found NGRI. \n52.  Defendant Kliebert’s policies, practices, and procedures, including maintaining a \nwaiting list for placement at ELMHS, cause scores of individuals to remain incarcerated in \ncorrectional facilities in Louisiana for months at a time following an NGRI determination and \ntheir commitment to a mental health facility. \n53.  Only  persons  with  mental  illness  in  Louisiana  are  intentionally  subjected  to \npunishment by incarceration in correctional facilities in the absence of pending criminal charges \nor a conviction of a criminal offense. \n54.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this Complaint, have acted under color of state \nlaw. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 12 of 16\n55.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this Complaint, have acted and continue to act \nwith deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ liberty interests.  \n56.  Defendants intentionally discriminate against persons found NGRI on the basis of \ntheir mental illness by confining them, or causing them to be confined, in Louisiana correctional \nfacilities where they are subjected to punishment and unable to access appropriate mental health \nservices. \n57.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this Complaint, knowingly and intentionally \nviolated Plaintiffs’ constitutional and federal statutory rights. \n58.   As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs, and the class they \nrepresent, have suffered or are likely to suffer deprivation of their liberty by incarceration in \ncorrectional  facilities,  discrimination  based  on  their  disabilities,  and  significant  irreparable \ndamage to their mental health.   \nVII.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n  A.  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS  \n59.    Under the Due Process Clause to the United States Constitution, individuals who \nhave not been properly charged with a crime or convicted may not be punished by incarceration \nin prison or jail. Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 369 (1983).  \n60.  “[D]ue process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\" Jackson v. Indiana, \n406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972).  \n61.     For insanity acquittees, the purpose of commitment is to provide treatment of \ntheir mental illness in a manner that is not punitive, and to protect society from dangerous \nbehavior that may result from that mental illness.  \n62.  For insanity acquittees, when either dangerousness or mental illness ceases to \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 13 of 16\nexist, the State has no legitimate interest in commitment.  \n63.    Defendants’  policies,  practices,  and  procedures, which cause individuals with \nmental illness who have been found NGRI and committed to mental health facilities to instead be \nconfined in correctional facilities, violate their rights under the Due Process Clause to the United \nStates Constitution. \n64.  As set forth in this Complaint, Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures of \nmaintaining a waiting list for placement at ELMHS that causes Plaintiffs to remain incarcerated \nin correctional facilities in Louisiana for months at a time following an NGRI determination and \ntheir commitment to a mental health facility, violate their rights under the Due Process Clause to \nthe United States Constitution.  \nB.  VIOLATIONS OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n65.

The ADA's implementing regulations further provide that \"a public entity may \nnot, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of \nadministration: (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability….” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3). \n68.  As set forth in this Complaint, Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures of \nmaintaining  a  waiting  list  for  placement  at  ELMHS,  which  cause  Plaintiffs  to  remain \nincarcerated in correctional facilities in Louisiana for months at a time following an NGRI \ndetermination and their commitment to a mental health facility, violate Title II of the ADA.  \nC.  VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \n  69.  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  states  that  \"[n]o  otherwise  qualified \nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving federal financial assistance . . ..\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n70.  Section 504's regulations also prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance \nfrom \"utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration ... (i) [t]hat have the effect of subjecting \nqualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap ….\" 45 C.F.R. § \n84.4(b)(4); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(I). \n71.  As set forth in this Complaint, Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures of \nmaintaining  a  waiting  list  for  placement  at  ELMHS,  which  cause  Plaintiffs  to  remain \nincarcerated in correctional facilities in Louisiana for months at a time following an NGRI \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-SCR   Document 1    08/14/14   Page 15 of 16\ndetermination and their commitment to  a mental health facility,  violate Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act. \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they represent pray for judgment against the \nDefendants as follows: \nA.  Certify this action as a class action; \nB.  Issue an order granting Plaintiffs and the class they represent permanent injunctive \nrelief prohibiting Defendants from confining persons with disabilities in correctional facilities, \nfollowing their commitment to a mental health facility; \n  C.

At the \ntime of the filing of the Second Amended Complaint, Mr. Perkins had been continuously \nincarcerated in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison for over two months after being \ncommitted to ELMHS. No other criminal charges have been filed against him. \n12.  Plaintiff  DOMINICK  PERNICIARO,  III,  is  a  30-year-old  man  with \nmental illness.  On April 8, 2015, the 24th Judicial District Court found Mr. Perniciaro \nnot guilty by reason of insanity to his pending criminal charges and committed him to \nELMHS.  Mr. Perniciaro has not been placed at ELMHS, but has instead remained \ncontinuously  incarcerated  in  Jefferson  Parish  Correctional  Center  since  the  NGBRI \nfinding. He is currently ninth on the waitlist for admission to ELMHS, per documentation \nprovided by Defendants’ counsel on April 10, 2015.  No other criminal charges have \nbeen filed against him. \n13.   Plaintiff SCOTT FRYE is a 49-year-old man with a mental illness.  On \nApril 7, 2014, the Calcasieu Parish District Court found Mr. Frye not guilty by reason of \ninsanity to the charge of simple robbery and committed him to ELMHS. Mr. Frye has \nbeen continuously incarcerated in the Calcasieu Parish Correctional Center since the date \nof that finding. No other criminal charges have been filed against him.  \n14.

Plaintiff FRANCIS MARY WATSON is a 52-year-old woman with a \nmental illness.  On December 8, 2014, the Lafayette Parish District Court found Ms. \nWatson not guilty by reason of insanity to two counts of armed robbery and committed \nher to ELMHS.  Ms. Watson has been continuously incarcerated in the Lafayette Parish \nCorrectional Center since the date of that finding. No other criminal charges have been \nfiled against her. \n16.   Plaintiff ADVOCACY CENTER is a private, federally-funded, non-profit \ncorporation, designated by Louisiana to serve as the State’s protection and advocacy \nsystem for persons with mental illness. \n17.  Plaintiff Advocacy Center is part of a nationwide network of disability \nrights  agencies  created  under  federal  law  to  provide  legal  representation  and  other \nadvocacy services on behalf of persons with disabilities (“Protection and Advocacy” \norganizations).    See  Protection  and  Advocacy  of  Individual  Rights  Program  of  the \nRehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  29  U.S.C.  § 794e  (2009);  Protection  and  Advocacy  for \nIndividuals  with  Mental  Illness  (“PAIMI”)  Act  of  1986,  42  U.S.C. §§10801–10851 \n(2009);  Developmental  Disabilities  Assistance  and  Bill  of  Rights  Act  of  2000,  42 \nU.S.C. §§15041–45  (2009).    Pursuant  to  these  statutes,  Protection  and  Advocacy \norganizations are authorized to investigate incidents of abuse or neglect of such persons, \nto enforce the federal and state constitutional and statutory rights of such persons through \nadministrative, legal, and other appropriate remedies, and to provide information and \nreferrals relating to programs and services addressing the needs of such persons. \n18.  In  addition  to  a  governing  board,  Plaintiff  Advocacy  Center  has  an \nadvisory board known as a “PAIMI Council.”  At least sixty percent of these PAIMI \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 7 of 26\nCouncil members have received or are receiving mental health services or are family \nmembers  of  such  individuals;  the  PAIMI  Council  also  includes  mental  health \nprofessionals  and  individuals  from  the  public  who  are  knowledgeable  about  mental \nillness.  Because so many people on the PAIMI Council have family members with \nmental health issues, it is not surprising that some of those family members have ended \nup in the criminal justice system, and inevitable that such involvement will continue. \n19.  Plaintiff  Advocacy  Center  has  met  with  persons  who  have  been \nincarcerated in Louisiana correctional facilities after a finding of NGRI and commitment \nto a mental health facility pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 657 (“NGRI Acquittees”). \nNGRI Acquitees have been, or are being, held for extended periods in parish prison. Each \nNGRI Acquittee is a constituent of the Advocacy Center and has suffered, and/or is \ncontinuing to suffer, an injury that would allow him or her to bring suit in his or her own \nright.  NGRI Acquittees without either relatives or friends with whom they are in contact \nwhile in jail have no one other than the Advocacy Center to act on their behalf in civil \nmatters. \n20.  Plaintiff Advocacy Center brings this suit as an associational plaintiff on \nbehalf of NGRI Acquittees, who allege that the actions of the Defendants in incarcerating \nindividuals who have been found NGRI violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, Section 504, and the ADA. \n21.  Defendant  KATHY  KLIEBERT  is  the  Secretary  of  the  Louisiana \nDepartment  of  Health  and  Hospitals  (“DHH”).  Pursuant  to  La.  R.S.  36:254,  she  is \nresponsible for the oversight, supervision and control of DHH and its divisions and is \nultimately responsible for ensuring that DHH’s services for people with disabilities are \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 8 of 26\nprovided  in  conformance  with  federal  law.  The  Community  Forensic  Coordinators \nprogram, which monitors and provides services to persons found NGBRI, is located \nwithin her Department. She is being sued in her official capacity only.  \n22.   Defendant  LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  AND \nHOSPITALS (DHH) is the state agency that operates Eastern Louisiana Mental Health \nSystem (ELMHS). ELMHS maintains a waiting list for the services it provides to persons \nwith mental illness who have been ordered to ELMHS to receive mental health treatment. \nDHH receives federal financial assistance and is a public entity as defined by 42 U.S.C. § \n12131(1)(B).  \nIV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n23.   Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n23(a) and (b)(2) on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated.1  The class \nconsists  of  all  persons  in  Louisiana  who  are  being,  or  who  may  be  in  the  future, \nincarcerated  in  Louisiana  correctional  facilities  after  a  finding  of  NGBRI  and  their \ncommitment to a mental health facility pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 657.  \n24.  The number of persons in the class is so numerous and in such fluctuation \nthat joinder of all of them is impractical. There are scores of individuals throughout the \nState of Louisiana who have been or will be found NGBRI and committed to a mental \nhealth facility, but who remain or will remain incarcerated in a parish jail, often for \nmonths at a time.  \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification at the time of the filing of the original Complaint (Rec. \nDoc. 2).  After a hearing on December 9, 2014, the Court denied the class certification motion based on a \nfinding that the joinder of individual plaintiffs was practicable (Rec. Doc. 44). Plaintiffs have retained the \nclass certification allegations in the instant Amended Complaint such that Plaintiffs retain the ability to \nrenew a motion for class certification if the circumstances upon which the Court based its denial change. \nPlaintiffs are not pursuing a motion for class certification at this time.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 9 of 26\n25.   The questions of law and fact raised in this case are common to both the \nnamed Plaintiffs and the class as defined above. These common questions of law and fact \ninclude whether it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution and is unlawful discrimination on the basis of disability to \nincarcerate individuals after a finding of NGBRI and an order that they be committed to a \nmental health facility, pursuant to La. Code Crim. P. art. 657, even though no other \ncriminal charges have been filed against them.  \n26.   The  claims  of  the  named  Plaintiffs  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the \nproposed class. As with Plaintiffs, the class of individuals they represent have been found \nNGBRI but nevertheless have been incarcerated in parish jails, even though no other \ncriminal charges have been filed against them.  \n27.   Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class, \nhave no interests that are antagonistic to the class, and seek relief that will benefit all \nmembers of the class. Plaintiffs are represented by counsel experienced in the prosecution \nof class actions.  \n28.   Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable \nto the class, making injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate for the class as a whole.  \nV. STATUTORY SCHEME \n29.   La. R.S. 14:14 states that an individual charged with a criminal offense is \nexempt from criminal responsibility for his behavior when “the circumstances indicate \nthat  because  of  a  mental  disease  or  mental  defect  the  offender  was  incapable  of \ndistinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the conduct in question.”  \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 10 of 26\n30.   La. R.S. 28:2(20) defines a mentally ill person as “any person with a \npsychiatric disorder which has substantial adverse effects on his ability to function and \nwho requires care and treatment.”  \n31.   When the defendant enters a plea of not guilty and NGBRI, the court may \nappoint a Sanity Commission, as provided in La. Code Crim. P. art. 644, to examine the \ndefendant to determine whether he or she was “insane” at the time of the offense. La. \nCode Crim. P. arts. 650– 652.  \n32.   A finding of NGBRI means that the defendant has committed the acts that \nconstitute the crime; however, the defense has proven by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the defendant was insane at the time the acts were committed and thus cannot be held \nlegally responsible. La. Code Crim. P. art. 651.  \n33.   La. Code Crim. P. art. 654 provides that if the defendant is found not \nguilty by reason of insanity in a non-capital case, the court shall remand him to the parish \njail or to a private mental institution approved by the court and promptly hold a hearing to \ndetermine whether the defendant can be released. When a verdict of not guilty by reason \nof insanity is returned in a capital case, the court shall commit the defendant to a state or \nprivate mental institution for care, custody, and treatment.  \n34.   Under the United States Constitution, an insanity acquittee’s liberty may \nbe curtailed only upon a finding that he is both dangerous and mentally ill. However, \nimplicit in the NGBRI acquittal is a finding that the defendant is mentally ill. Therefore, \nat the initial hearing following an NGBRI finding, the only issue before the court in \ndetermining  whether  the  acquittee  should  be  released  or  committed,  is  whether  the \nacquittee is dangerous.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 11 of 26\n35.   If  the  court  determines  that  the  defendant  cannot  be  released  without \ndanger to himself or others, the court shall order him committed to a proper state mental \ninstitution or to a private mental institution approved by the court for custody, care, and \ntreatment. La. Code Crim. P. art. 654.  \n  36.   Even if a defendant has been committed under La. Code Crim. P. art. 654, \nas a result of having been found dangerous and presumed mentally ill based on the \nfinding of NGBRI, the acquittee or the superintendent of the facility in which he or she is \nbeing held may later apply for discharge or conditional release.  \n37.  Under Louisiana’s statutory scheme, after a contradictory hearing, and \nconsidering  the  Sanity  Commission’s  findings,  the  court  may  order  the  individual’s \nrelease, place him on conditional release, or commit him. La. Code Crim. P. art. 657.1.  \nVI.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \na.   Plaintiff Brandon Cooper \n38.   Mr.  Cooper  has  been  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  and  was  first \nhospitalized for mental health problems when he was a teenager.  He currently receives a \nmonthly injection of the psychotropic medication Haldol. \n39.   On or about December 12, 2012, Mr. Cooper was arrested and placed in \nthe St. Tammany Parish Jail for two counts of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.  \n  40.   On April 8, 2013, Mr. Cooper’s public defender filed an application with \nthe St. Tammany Parish District Court to determine Mr. Cooper’s present mental health \ncondition,  and  his  mental  health  condition  at  the  time  of  the  alleged  offense.  Mr. \nCooper’s public defender advised the court that he had good reason to believe that Mr. \nCooper was not of sound mind and understanding and was currently insane and insane at \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 12 of 26\nthe time of the alleged offense; and that Mr. Cooper was “mentally defective or deficient” \nand unable to understand his criminal proceedings. Mr. Cooper’s public defender asked \nthe court to appoint two physicians to examine Mr. Cooper with regard to his mental \ncondition.  \n  41.   On May 9, 2013, the circuit court appointed two physicians to examine \nMr. Cooper, and scheduled a hearing for June 27, 2013, to determine Mr. Cooper’s \npresent mental condition, and his mental condition at the time of the alleged offenses.  \n42.   On February 14, 2014, the circuit court adjudicated Mr. Cooper NGBRI \nand ordered him committed to ELMHS. However, as of the date of the filing of the \noriginal Complaint, Mr. Cooper remained in the St. Tammany Parish Jail, where his \nmental health treatment was limited to monthly injections of Haldol.  \nb.   Plaintiff Louis Davenport  \n43.   Mr. Davenport has been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar \nType, and has been hospitalized for mental health treatment on several occasions.  \n44.   In late 2012 or early 2013, Mr. Davenport was transferred to the Jefferson \nParish Correctional Center from the Orleans Parish Prison for allegedly forfeiting a bond \nissued to him by the Jefferson Parish District Court in 2007. On or about March 19, 2013, \nwhile suffering from untreated psychosis, Mr. Davenport was accused of committing a \nbattery upon a Jefferson Parish correctional officer who tried to escort Mr. Davenport out \nof the jail infirmary.  \n45.   On or about March 22, 2013, Mr. Davenport was transported to ELMHS \nfor a competency evaluation, at which time the Department of Health and Hospitals \nreported that Mr. Davenport was in a “floridly psychotic state” and had a “significant \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 13 of 26\npsychosis and mood disturbance.” It took the doctors at ELMHS five months to stabilize \nMr. Davenport through medication.  \n46.   On or about September 19, 2013, Mr. Davenport’s public defender filed a \nMotion for Mental Examination with the Jefferson Parish District Court to request that \nthe court appoint physicians to evaluate Mr. Davenport to determine if he was insane at \nthe time of his alleged offense. The district court ordered a sanity evaluation that same \nday.  \n47.   On April 23, 2014, the district court adjudicated Mr. Davenport NGBRI \nand committed him to ELMHS. However, as of the date of the filing of the original \nComplaint, Mr. Davenport remained in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center, where \nhis mental health treatment was limited to receiving his daily psychotropic medications.  \nc.   Plaintiff Ron Gatlin  \n48.   Mr. Gatlin has a history of mental illness dating back to his childhood. On \nor about July 15, 2013, Mr. Gatlin was charged with one count of obscenity for an \nincident that occurred in the Kenner City Jail. Although Mr. Gatlin had been hospitalized \nfor mental health problems just a few months prior to this offense, he was not receiving \nany medication or treatment in jail at the time that he was charged with obscenity.  \n49.   On or about December 17, 2013, Mr. Gatlin’s public defender filed a \nmotion with the Jefferson Parish District Court requesting the appointment of a sanity \ncommission to determine whether Mr. Gatlin was insane at the time of the alleged \nobscenity offense.  \n50.   On March 19, 2014, the district court adjudicated Mr. Gatlin not guilty by \nreason of insanity and committed him to ELMHS. However, as of the date of the filing of \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 14 of 26\nthe original Complaint, Mr. Gatlin remained in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center, \nwhere his mental health treatment was limited to his daily psychotropic medications.  \n  d.   Plaintiff Kenny Swatt  \n51.   On  or  about  July  1,  2013,  Mr.  Swatt  was  arrested  for  one  count  of \naggravated battery and placed in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center, where he was \ngiven medication for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.  \n52.   On or about September 10, 2013, Mr. Swatt’s public defender filed a \nmotion with the Jefferson Parish District Court requesting the appointment of a sanity \ncommission  to  determine  whether  Mr.  Swatt  was  insane  at  the  time  of  the  alleged \noffense. The district court appointed a sanity commission on September 11, 2013, and \nordered the commission to report its findings to the court by November 13, 2013.  \n53.   On April 23, 2014, the district court adjudicated Mr. Swatt not guilty by \nreason of insanity for one count of aggravated battery and committed him to ELMHS. \nHowever, as of the date of the filing of the original Complaint, Mr. Swatt remained \nincarcerated  in  the  Jefferson  Parish  Correctional  Center,  where  his  mental  health \ntreatment was limited to receiving the medication Haldol. Due to the lack of treatment, \nMr. Swatt spent nearly all of his time incarcerated sleeping. \ne.   Plaintiff Stephen Zeringue  \n54.   Mr.  Zeringue  has  a  lengthy  history  of  mental  health  problems  and \npsychiatric treatment dating back to his childhood. On or about January 4, 2013, Mr. \nZeringue was arrested for one count of aggravated arson and placed in the Jefferson \nParish Correctional Center.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 15 of 26\n  55.   On or about March 27, 2013, Mr. Zeringue was found incompetent to \nstand trial, and was remanded to ELMHS to be restored to competency. Mr. Zeringue \nremained at ELMHS for over five months, and was eventually returned to the Jefferson \nParish Correctional Center around September 19, 2013.  \n56.   On November 19, 2014, Mr. Zeringue’s public defender filed a motion \nwith  the  Jefferson  Parish  District  Court  to  request  the  appointment  of  a  sanity \ncommission to determine whether Mr. Zeringue was insane at the time of the alleged \noffense. The district court appointed a sanity commission that same day, and ordered the \nphysicians to report their findings to the court on January 8, 2014.  \n57.   On March 19, 2014, the district court found Mr. Zeringue not guilty by \nreason of insanity and committed him to ELMHS. However, despite this order, at the \ntime of the filing of the original Complaint, Mr. Zeringue remained incarcerated in the \nJefferson Parish Correctional Center, where his mental health treatment was limited to \noral psychotropic medications.  \n  f.   Plaintiff William Pitzer  \n58.   William Pitzer was arrested on or around February 28, 2012, for two \ncounts of auto theft and one count of theft and was incarcerated at Jefferson Parish \nCorrectional  Center.  He  was  initially  deemed  incompetent  to  stand  trial,  and  was \nremanded to ELMHS on or around February 20, 2013, to be restored to competency. At \nthe time of his admission, the physicians at ELMHS described him as psychotic and \ndelusional, and diagnosed him with delusional disorder.  \n59.   Mr. Pitzer returned to the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center at the end \nof June 2013, and on or about July 18, 2013, Mr. Pitzer’s public defender filed a motion \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 16 of 26\nto request a sanity commission to determine whether Mr. Pitzer was insane at the time of \nthe alleged offenses.  \n60.   On April 16, 2014, the Jefferson Parish District Court adjudicated Mr. \nPitzer not guilty by reason of insanity, and committed him to ELMHS. However, as of \nthe date of the filing of the original Complaint, Mr. Pitzer remained incarcerated in the \nJefferson Parish Correctional Center, where his mental health treatment was limited to \noral psychotropic medications. Mr. Pitzer did not receive any visitors while incarcerated, \nand passed his time in Jefferson Parish Correctional Center by sleeping through the day.  \ng.  Plaintiff Tyrin Perkins \n61.   Plaintiff Tyrin Perkins is a 21-year-old man with mental illness.  He has \nbeen diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has been hospitalized numerous times related to \nhis illness.   \n62.  Mr. Perkins was found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity to one charge of \nArmed Robbery on March 20, 2014.  \n63.  Upon being found NGBRI, Mr. Perkins was conditionally released and \nplaced in the custody of Harmony Transitional Center, a group home located in Baton \nRouge, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 558.1 and 658.1.  He was further placed on \nsupervised/active probation for a period of five (5) years, pursuant to La. Code Crim. \nProc. arts. 657, 658, and 895. \n64.  Mr. Perkins was arrested on or about August 20, 2014, after allegedly \nleaving the group home without permission.  He was not charged with any criminal \noffense, but was nonetheless incarcerated in East Baton Rouge Parish Prison pending a \nprobation revocation hearing. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 17 of 26\n65.  On August 25, 2014, Judge Anthony J. Marabella Jr. of the 19th Judicial \nDistrict Court revoked Mr. Perkins’ supervised probation based on a finding that he was \n“in  need  of  indefinite  hospitalization  due  to  the  presence  of  mental  illness  and/or \ndangerousness.”   \n66.  The court ordered that Mr. Perkins be recommitted to ELMHS pursuant to \nLa. Code Crim. Proc. art. 658(B)(4).  \n67.  Mr. Perkins had not been recommitted to ELMHS at the time of the filing \nof the Second Amended Complaint.  He remained incarcerated in East Baton Rouge \nParish Prison for over two months after the court ordered him committed to ELMHS. The \nmajority of his incarceration at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison was spent in solitary \nconfinement, and his treatment was limited to oral medications.  He was placed on \nsuicide watch on at least one occasion during this period. \nh.  Plaintiff Dominick Perniciaro, III \n68.  Mr. Perniciaro is a 30-year-old man with mental illness.  He has been \ndiagnosed  with  schizoaffective  disorder,  which  manifests  in  extreme  paranoia.    Mr. \nPerniciaro has been hospitalized on numerous occasions since the age of 21, and has \nattempted suicide on at least two prior occasions.  \n69.  Mr. Perniciaro was arrested by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Department \nin June 2013 following an altercation with a neighbor. \n70.  During the course of his arrest processing at Jefferson Parish Correctional \nCenter, and while experiencing untreated psychosis, Mr. Perniciaro had an altercation \nwith several correctional officers.  Officers subsequently slammed Mr. Perniciaro’s face \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 18 of 26\ninto a brick cinder block wall, breaking three of his front teeth.  Mr. Perniciaro was \ncharged with additional criminal counts related to this incident. \n71.  The 24th Judicial District Court found Plaintiff incompetent to stand trial \nand on August 22, 2013, he was committed to ELMHS for competency restoration. \n72.  After nearly seven months of commitment at ELMHS, on March 21, 2014, \nPlaintiff was determined to have been restored to competency and was transferred back to \nJefferson Parish Correctional Center. \n73.   Shortly after his arrival at Jefferson Parish Correctional Center, Plaintiff \nwas determined by the examining psychiatrist and psychologist appointed by the 24th \nJudicial District Court to be “floridly psychotic.”  The psychiatrist and psychologist \nrecommended that he be returned to ELMHS for another competency restoration. \n74.  Plaintiff was re-committed and returned to ELMHS on April 15, 2014. \n75.  After nearly eight months of commitment at ELMHS, in December 2014, \nPlaintiff was again determined to be competent.  He was returned to Jefferson Parish \nCorrectional Center. \n76.  In February 2015, Mr. Perniciaro’s was re-evaluated by the psychiatrist \nand psychologist appointed by the district court.  Based upon their recommendation, and \nthe agreement of the prosecuting attorneys, the Court, and Plaintiff’s criminal counsel, \nthe Court accepted a plea of NGBRI to Mr. Perniciaro’s pending criminal charges. \n  77.  On April 8, 2015, Judge Danyelle Taylor of the 24th Judicial District Court \nfound Mr. Perniciaro NGBRI and ordered him committed to ELMHS.  \n78.   Mr.  Perniciaro  remains  incarcerated  in  Jefferson  Parish  Correctional \nCenter despite being found NGBRI to the criminal charges facing him.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 19 of 26\n79.  The  entirety  of  Mr.  Perniciaro’s  incarceration  at  Jefferson  Parish \nCorrectional Center has been spent in solitary confinement, with no access to family \nvisits, telephone calls, sunlight, or exercise.  Mr. Perniciaro is not allowed access to any \npens or pencils, and so is unable to write to his family or legal counsel.  He is not allowed \nto leave his cell at all except during the brief period that he is allowed to shower.  He has \nphysical injuries, including a dislocated shoulder sustained during his commitment at \nELMHS, which have remained untreated during his incarceration.

Mr.  Frye  is  a  49-year-old  man  with  a  mental  illness,  namely \nschizophrenia, who is  currently incarcerated in Calcasieu Parish Correctional  Center \ndespite being found NGBRI to the criminal charges facing him. \n81.  On April 7, 2014, the Calcasieu Parish District Court found Mr. Frye not \nguilty by reason of insanity to the charge of simple robbery and committed him to \nELMHS.    \n82.  Mr.  Frye  has  not  been  placed  at  ELMHS,  but  has  been  continuously \nincarcerated in the Calcasieu Parish Correctional Center since the date of that finding..   \n83.  No other criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Frye. \nj.   Plaintiff Ryan Kazami \n84.  Plaintiff Ryan Kazami is a 40-year-old man with a mental illness who is \ncurrently  incarcerated  in  Lafayette  Parish  Correctional  Center  despite  being  found \nNGBRI to the criminal charges facing him. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 20 of 26\n85.  On March 23, 2015, the Lafayette Parish District Court found Mr. Kazami \nnot  guilty by  reason of insanity to  the charge of terrorizing and committed him to \nELMHS.   \n86.

No other criminal charges have been filed against Ms. Watson.  \nl. Defendants’ Unconstitutional Policies and Practices  \n92.   The  primary  purpose  for  incarcerating  individuals  in  Louisiana \ncorrectional facilities is punishment and pre-trial detention. Such facilities do not have \nthe capacity to provide the mental health treatment to individuals found NGBRI.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 21 of 26\n93.   Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures, including maintaining a \nwaiting list for placement at ELMHS, cause scores of individuals to remain incarcerated \nin  correctional  facilities  in  Louisiana  for  months  at  a  time  following  an  NGBRI \ndetermination and their commitment to a mental health facility.  \n94.   Only persons with mental illness in Louisiana are intentionally subjected \nto  punishment  by  incarceration  in  correctional  facilities  in  the  absence  of  pending \ncriminal charges or a conviction of a criminal offense.  \n95.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this Third Amended Complaint, have \nacted under color of state law.  \n96.   Defendants, at all times relevant to this Third Amended Complaint, have \nacted and continue to act with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ liberty interests.  \n97.   Defendants intentionally discriminate against persons found NGBRI on \nthe basis of their mental illness by confining them, or causing them to be confined, in \nLouisiana correctional facilities where they are subjected to punishment and unable to \naccess appropriate mental health services.  \n98.   Defendants,  at  all  times  relevant  to  this  Third  Amended  Complaint, \nknowingly and intentionally violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional and federal statutory rights.  \n  99.   As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, Plaintiffs, and the class \nthey  represent,  have  suffered  or  are  likely  to  suffer  deprivation  of  their  liberty  by \nincarceration  in  correctional  facilities,  discrimination  based  on  their  disabilities,  and \nsignificant irreparable damage to their mental health.  \n   \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 22 of 26\nVII. CAUSES OF ACTION   \nA.   VIOLATIONS OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS   \n100.  Under  the  Due  Process  Clause  to  the  United  States  Constitution, \nindividuals who have not been properly charged with a crime or convicted may not be \npunished by incarceration in prison or jail. Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 369 \n(1983).  \n101.   “[D]ue process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear \nsome reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\" Jackson \nv. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972).  \n102.   For NGBRI acquittees, the purpose of commitment is to provide treatment \nof their mental illness in a manner that is not punitive, and to protect society from \ndangerous behavior that may result from that mental illness.  \n103.   For NGBRI acquittees, when either dangerousness or mental illness ceases \nto exist, the State has no legitimate interest in commitment.   \n104.   As  set  forth  in  this  Third  Amended  Complaint,  Defendant  Kliebert’s \npolicies, practices, and procedures of maintaining a waiting list for placement at ELMHS, \nwhich have caused and continue to cause individuals with mental illness who have been \nfound  NGBRI  and  committed  to  mental  health  facilities  to  instead  be  confined  in \ncorrectional facilities, violate those individuals’ rights under the Due Process Clause to \nthe United States Constitution.  \n105.   As  set  forth  in  this  Third  Amended  Complaint,  Defendant  Kliebert’s \npolicies, practices, and procedures of maintaining a waiting list for placement at ELMHS \nthat  have  caused  and  continue  to  cause  the  named  Plaintiffs  to  be  incarcerated  in \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 23 of 26\ncorrectional  facilities  in  Louisiana  for  months  at  a  time  following  an  NGBRI \ndetermination and their commitment to a mental health facility, violate their rights under \nthe Due Process Clause to the United States Constitution.  \nB.   VIOLATIONS OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT  \n106.   As  qualified  persons  with  disabilities,  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  the \nprotections and benefits of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which provides \nthat “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n107.   Regulations  implementing  the  ADA  prohibit  a  public  entity  from \nproviding any aid, benefit, or service, directly or through contractual licensing, or other \narrangements that (i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to \nparticipate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service; (ii) Afford a qualified individual \nwith a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or \nservice that is not equal to that afforded others; (iii) Provide a qualified individual with a \ndisability with  an aid,  benefit, or service that is  not  as effective in  affording equal \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level \nof achievement as that provided to others; and (iv) Provide different or separate aids, \nbenefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with \ndisabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified \nindividuals with disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as effective as those \nprovided to others. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i–iv).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 24 of 26\n108.   The ADA’s implementing regulations further provide that “a public entity \nmay not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other \nmethods of administration:  (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals \nwith disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability....” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3).  \n109.   As  set  forth  in  this  Third  Amended  Complaint,  Defendants’  policies, \npractices, and procedures of maintaining a waiting list for placement at ELMHS, which \nhave  caused  and  continue  to  cause  Plaintiffs  to  remain  incarcerated  in  correctional \nfacilities in Louisiana for months at a time following an NGBRI determination and their \ncommitment to a mental health facility, violate Title II of the ADA.  \nC.   VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT  \n110.   Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that “[n]o otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving federal financial assistance . . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \n111.   Section  504’s  regulations  also  prohibit  recipients  of  federal  financial \nassistance from “utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration . . . (i) [t]hat have the \neffect  of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to  discrimination  on the basis of \nhandicap . . . .” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i).  \n112.   As set forth in this Third Amended Complaint, Defendants’ policies, \npractices, and procedures of maintaining a waiting list for placement at ELMHS, which \nhave caused and continue to cause Plaintiffs to remain incarcerated in correctional \nfacilities in Louisiana for months at a time following an NGBRI determination and their \ncommitment to a mental health facility, violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB   Document 65    05/13/15   Page 25 of 26\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they represent pray for judgment against the \nDefendants as follows:  \nA.  Certify this action as a class action;  \nB.  Issue  an  order  granting  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  they  represent  permanent \ninjunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from confining persons with disabilities \nin correctional facilities, following their commitment to a mental health facility;  \nC.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures \nof continuing to confine persons with disabilities in state correctional facilities, \nfollowing their commitment to a mental health facility, violate Plaintiffs’ rights \nunder the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990;  \nD.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs;  \nE.

Plaintiffs are criminal offenders with mental illnesses who have \nbeen adjudicated “Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity” (“NGRI”) and ordered committed to \nEast  Louisiana  Mental  Health  System  (“ELMHS”)  pursuant  to  Article  657  of  the \nLouisiana  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.4  Plaintiffs  allege  that  after  having  been \nadjudicated  NGRI  and  ordered  committed  to  ELMHS  they  remain  incarcerated  in \nLouisiana  correctional  facilities  for  months  while  awaiting  bed  space  at  ELMHS.   \nPlaintiffs allege that their continued incarceration under these circumstances violates \nthe Fourteenth Amendment5; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)6; and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”)7.

Rule 12(b)(1) \nA 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss is analyzed under the same rubric as a 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss.  The Court must accept all well pleaded facts in the Complaint as \ntrue and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  While a 12(b)(6) motion is \ndetermined solely on the face of the pleadings, for purposes of a 12(b)(1) motion, the \nCourt may look at evidence in the record.9  A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction should only be granted if it appears that the plaintiff “cannot prove any set of \nfacts” in support of the plaintiff’s claims to relief.10  In ascertaining the likelihood of \nwhether the plaintiff can “prove any set of facts” in support of his/her claims for relief, \nthe Court may evaluate the Complaint, supplemented by undisputed facts, and the \nCourt’s resolution of disputed facts.11  Furthermore, “[w]hen a Rule 12(b)(1) motion is \nfiled in conjunction with other Rule 12 motions, the court should consider the Rule \n12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack before addressing any attack on the merits.”12 \nB. Eleventh Amendment \n  The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States \nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted \nagainst one of the United States by Citizens of another State or by Citizens or subjects \nof  any  Foreign  State.”13    Where  there  is  Eleventh  Amendment  immunity  from  suit, \n                                                 \n9 Ambraco, Inc. v.

U.S., 281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir. 2001)(“Lack of subject matter may be found in any of \nthree instances: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced \nin the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court’s resolution of \ndisputed facts.”). \n12 Id. \n13 United States Constitution, Amendment XI.   \n3\n24341 \n\nfederal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction.14  Although not expressed by its terms, \nEleventh Amendment Immunity is triggered when a citizen brings a suit against his/her \nown state in federal court.15  In this case, the Plaintiffs have named a state entity, DHH, \nand  a  state  official,  Kathy  Kliebert,  secretary  of  DHH  in  her  official  capacity,  as \nDefendants. \nThe Eleventh Amendment bars suit against State entities where the entity is an \narm of the State such that the suit is in reality a suit against the State itself.16  The Fifth \nCircuit has held that DHH is an arm of the State and is, therefore, entitled to Eleventh \nAmendment Immunity.17  Likewise, “[t]he Eleventh Amendment bars a suit against state \nofficials when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in interest’.”18  “The general rule is \nthat relief sought nominally against an officer is in fact against the sovereign if the \ndecree would operate against the latter.”19  “A suit against state officials that is in fact a \nsuit against a State is barred regardless of whether it seeks damages or injunctive \nrelief.”20  Accordingly, in this case, the Court starts with the premise that the Eleventh \nAmendment bars claims against DHH and its Secretary, unless immunity has been \n                                                 \n14 See, Wagstaff, 509 F.3d at 664. \n15 Tennessee v.

ANALYSIS \nA. Secretary of DHH’s Sovereign Immunity Defense \nThe  Supreme  Court’s  holding  in  Ex  Parte  Young  recognized  an  important \nexception to the general rule of sovereign immunity for state officials.  Ex Parte Young \nholds that the Eleventh Amendment does not prohibit a federal court from issuing an \ninjunction  against  a  state  official  to  enjoin  unconstitutional  acts  rooted  in  federal \nauthority.24  In this case, the Plaintiffs allege that Kathy Kliebert, as the Secretary of \nDHH,25 acting in her official capacity, has engaged in an ongoing violation of federal \nconstitutional law by depriving persons with mental illness, who have been adjudged \nNGRI, to remain confined in correctional facilities as opposed to mental health facilities \nto which they have been ordered committed.26  Plaintiffs allege that this continuous \nincarceration amounts to a deprivation of NGRI detainees’ liberty interests guaranteed \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Plaintiffs seek declaratory and prospective \ninjunctive relief only against the Secretary of DHH, whom the Plaintiffs allege has acted \n                                                 \n21 Federal Courts lack jurisdiction over suits against a State, a State agency, or a State official in his/her \nofficial capacity unless the State has waived its sovereign immunity or Congress has clearly abrogated \nthe State’s sovereign immunity. Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55, 116 S. Ct. 114, 134 \nL. Ed. 2nd 252 (1996); Moore v. Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, 743 F.3d 959, \n963 (2014). \n22 Id. \n23 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441 (1908).   \n24  Id.  As explained by the Fifth Circuit, “[t]o meet the Ex Parte Young exception, a plaintiff’s suit alleging \na violation of federal law must be brought against individual persons in their official capacities as agents \nof the state, and the relief sought must be declaratory or injunctive in nature and prospective in effect.”  \nAguilar v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, 160 F.3d 1052, 1054 (5th Cir. 1998). \n25 La. R.S. 36:254 sets forth the “powers and duties” of the Secretary of DHH.  Notably, the Secretary \n“shall organized, plan supervise, direct, administer, execute, and be responsible for the functions and \nprograms vested in the Department [DHH], in the manner and to the extent provided by this Title.”  La. \nR.S. 36:254(A)(4). \n26 Rec. Doc. 1.  \n5\n24341 \n\nunconstitutionally.    Therefore,  the  Ex  Parte  Young  exception  to  the  Eleventh \nAmendment  immunity  applies  and  this  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  Plaintiffs’  42 \nU.S.C. 1983 claims against Kathy Kliebert, Secretary of DHH, in her official capacity. \nThe  Plaintiffs’  ADA  Title  II  and  RA  §504  claims  for  injunctive  against  DHH \nSecretary Kliebert can also proceed.  In McCarthy ex rel. Travis v. Hawkins 27 the Fifth \nCircuit  rejected  the  argument  Ex  Parte  Young  applies  only  to  cases  against  state \nofficials that involve the violation of a federal right, not merely a violation of federal law. \nIn rejecting this argument, the Fifth Circuit drew upon the Supreme Court’s guidance in \nVerizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Service Commission 28  that “the inquiry into whether \nsuit lies under Ex parte Young does not include an analysis of the merits of the claim.”29 \nOn the contrary, the Court explained that “[i]n determining whether the doctrine of Ex \nparte Young avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a \n‘straightforward  inquiry  into  whether  [the]  complaint  alleges  an  ongoing  violation  of \nfederal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’”30 Accordingly, the \nCourt has jurisdiction over the Plaintiff’s ongoing constitutional claims and ADA Title II \nand R.A. §504 claims against Kathy Kliebert, in her official capacity as Secretary of \nDHH. The Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss the Plaintiffs’ claims against \nKathy Kliebert in her official capacity on the defense of sovereign immunity shall be \nDENIED. \n \n                                                 \n27 381 F.3d 407, 415 (5th Cir. 2004). \n28 535 U.S. 635, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002). \n29 Id. at 646, 122 S.Ct. 1753. \n30 381 F.3d 407, 416 (5th Cir. 2004) citing, Verizon Maryland, Inc. v. Public Service Commission, 122 \nS.Ct. 1753.  See also, McCarthy ex rel. Travis v. Hawkins, 381 F.3d 407, 416 (2004)(explaining how the \nSupreme Court in Verizon Maryland, Inc., “made clear that analyzing the applicability of the Ex Parte \nYoung exception should generally be a simple matter, which excludes questions regarding the validity of \nthe plaintiff’s cause of action.”). \n6\n24341 \n\nB. DHH’s Sovereign Immunity Defense \nThe  Ex  Parte  Young  exception  to  sovereign  immunity  applies  only  to  State \nofficials acting in their official capacities and does not apply to State agencies.31  Thus, \neven though the Court has Ex Parte Young jurisdiction over claims for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief as to Kathy Kliebert, Secretary of DHH, in her official capacity, the Court \nlacks jurisdiction to hear claims brought directly against DHH32 unless the State has \nwaived its sovereign immunity for those claims or Congress has clearly abrogated the \nState’s sovereign immunity as to those claims.33  \nTo determine whether Congress has abrogated the State’s Eleventh Amendment \nImmunity, the United States Supreme Court instructs that two predicate questions must \nbe answered; first, whether Congress expressed an unequivocal intent to abrogate \nState immunity and, if so, second, whether Congress “acted pursuant to a valid grant of \nConstitutional authority.”34   \nThe ADA and the RA contain unequivocal statements of intent to abrogate.35  \nThus the question becomes whether Congress’ abrogation of state sovereign immunity \n                                                 \n31 Moore v. Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, 743 F. 3d 959, 963 (5th Cir. \n2014)(citing Puerto Rico Aquaduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf and Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 146, 113 \nS.Ct. 684, 121 L. Ed. 2nd 605 (1993)(The Ex Parte Young doctrine “has no application in suits against the \nStates and their agencies, which are barred regardless of the relief sought.”). \n32 In its Memorandum in Support of dismissal, DHH admits that the Community Forensic Services \nprogram is administered by DHH, ELMHS.  Rec. Doc. 8-1, p. 7. \n33 Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 123 S. Ct. 1972 (2003) holding that Congress may \nabrogate a State’s immunity from suit in federal court “if it makes its intention to abrogate unmistakably \nclear in the language of the statute and act pursuant to a valid exercise of its power [to enforce the \nConstitutional guarantee of due process] under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” \n34 Tennessee v. Lane, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 1985 (2004)(quoting Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 120 S.Ct. \n631, at 640 (2000)). \n35  See  42 U.S.C.  §  12202  (“A  State shall not  be  immune under  the  eleventh  amendment  to  the \nConstitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a \nviolation of this chapter.”); 42 U.S.C. § 2000d–7(a)(1) (“A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh \nAmendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ....”); see also Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 121 \nS.Ct 955 (2001) (finding unequivocal statement requirement met for ADA). \n7\n24341 \n\nis a valid exercise of its power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce \nthe substantive guarantees of that amendment.36 \n  In Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \nabrogation of state sovereignty with respect to the enforcement of Title I of the ADA was \nnot a valid exercise of Congress’ §5 power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nprohibition on unconstitutional disability discrimination in public employment.37  “Garrett \nleft open the question whether Title II is a valid exercise of Congress’ §5 enforcement \npower.”38 \n  Addressing sovereign immunity in the context of Title II of the ADA, in Tennessee \nv. Lane the U.S. Supreme Court held that the abrogation of sovereign immunity for \npurposes of Title II is a valid exercise of Congressional power, to the extent that “‘it \napplies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts.”39 \nThe Court expressly did not consider whether abrogation under Title II extended to \nother rights considered to be fundamental under the Constitution.40   \nThe unanswered question is whether the principle of Lane extends to cases \ninvolving other fundamental rights, such as the liberty interests implicated in this case.  \nIn U.S. v. Georgia, the Supreme Court addressed “whether Title II of the ADA validly \nabrogates state sovereign immunity with respect to the claims” of a paraplegic wheel \nchair  confined  prisoner  challenging  the  conditions  of  his  confinement.41  The  Court \n                                                 \n36 Tennessee v. Lane, 124 S.Ct. at 1985. \n37 Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 518, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 \n(2001). \n38 Id. at 522. \n39 Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. at 533-34; See also, Bennett-Nelson v. Louisiana Bd of Regents, 431 \nF.3d 448 (2005) (citing Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 at 533-34 (2004)). \n40 Pace v. Bogalusa City School Board, 403 F.3d 272, 287 (5th Cir. 2005)(en banc). \n41 U.S. v Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 156, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006). Plaintiff alleged that the \nstate prison officials failed to accommodate his disability-related needs including mobility, hygiene and \n8\n24341 \n\ndeclined  to  hold  that  Title  II  of  the  ADA  operates  a  wholesale  abrogation  of  state \nsovereignty. Finding that the Plaintiffs ADA Title II claims were “based, at least in large \npart, on conduct that independently violated the provisions of § 1 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment”42, the Court held that “Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity”43  \nwhere the cause of action arises from “conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth \nAmendment.”44 The scope of Title II’s abrogation of state sovereignty remains unclear.   \nLikewise,  the  Fifth  Circuit  has  “yet  to  decide  whether  the  principle  of  Lane \nextends to cases involving other rights.”45  For the reasons stated by the Fifth Circuit in \nPace v Bogalusa City School Bd.46 and Bennett-Nelson v. Louisiana Board of Regents47 \nthis Court need not address the parameters or scope of Title II’s abrogation of state \nsovereignty. \n  The Fifth Circuit has held that the state’s receipt of federal funds is a knowing \nand voluntary waiver of its sovereign immunity as to claims arising under § 504 of the \nRA.48    The  Complaint  in  this  case  alleges  that  “DHH  receives  federal  financial \nassistance  and  is  a  public  entity  as  defined  by  42  USC  Section  12131(1)(B).”49  \nDefendants do not challenge this allegation.  Hence, considering the pleadings the \n                                                                                                                                                             \nmedical care and that he was excluded from participation in prison activities and programs due to his \ndisability.  \n42 Id. 126 S.Ct. at 881. \n43 Id. 126 S.Ct. at 882 (emphasis original). \n44 Id. \n45 Bennett-Nelson v. Louisiana Board of Regents, 431 F.3d 448, 454 (2005). \n46 Pace v. Bogalusa City School Board, 403 F 3d 272 (5th Cir. 2005). \n47 In Bennett-Nelson, 431 F.3d 448, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that because the rights and remedies are \nthe same under Title II of the ADA and §5 of the Rehabilitation Act, it need not reach the question of \nwhether Congress constitutionally abrogated sovereign immunity under Title II of the ADA as applied to a \npublic Louisiana university’s alleged failure to make reasonable accommodations for hearing impaired \nstudents.  The Court concluded that Louisiana had waived its sovereign immunity from actions under 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act and, since the rights and remedies under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and \nunder Title II of the ADA were coextensive under the facts of that case, the Court need not reach the Title \nII abrogation question. \n48 Pace v. Bogalusa City School Board, 403 F.2d 272 (2005)(en banc). \n49 Rec. Doc. 1, paragraph 11. \n9\n24341 \n\nCourt concludes that the State has waived it sovereign immunity from suit under §504 of \nthe RA. The Court further finds that the rights and remedies invoked in this case under \nTitle II of the ADA and Section 504 of the RA are virtually identical.50  Since Louisiana \nhas validly waived its sovereign immunity from actions under §504 of the RA, whether \nor not Congress has constitutionally abrogated state sovereignty under Title II of the \nADA under the circumstances in this case need not be reached.  The Court shall has \njurisdiction  over  Plaintiffs’  claims  arising  §504  of  the  RA,  which  for  all  intents  and \npurposes is identical to the plaintiffs’ claims under Title II of the R.A. \n  As for Plaintiffs’ remaining claims against DHH, there has been no abrogation of \nthe State’s sovereign immunity from suit in federal court for claims arising under 42 \nU.S.C. §1983.  The United States Supreme Court has expressly held “[t]hat Congress, \nin  passing  §1983,  had  no  intention  to  disturb  the  States’  Eleventh  Amendment \nimmunity.”51  Likewise there has been no waiver by the State of its sovereign immunity \nfor the §1983 claims.  Hence while the Court has jurisdiction over the ADA Title II and \n§504 RA claims, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs’ remaining \n42 U.S.C. §1983 claims against DHH.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims \n                                                 \n50 As to both of these claims, Plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive and declaratory relief barring the \ndiscriminatory practice of incarcerating persons deemed NGRI on the basis of their disability while \nawaiting placement in mental health facilities.  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs have alleged that “Defendants’ \nincarceration of individuals found NGRI constitutes intentional discrimination on the basis of disability \nbecause ‘[o]nly persons with mental illness in Louisiana are intentionally subjected to punishment by \nincarceration in correctional facilities in the absence of pending criminal charges or a conviction of a \ncriminal offense.”  Additionally  “Defendants intentionally discriminate against persons found NGRI on the \nbasis of their mental illness by confining them, or causing them to be confined, in Louisiana  correctional \nfacilities where they are subjected to punishment and unable to access appropriate mental health \nservices” in violation of the ADA.  Similarly, Plaintiffs allege violations of the RA based on “Defendants’ \npolicies, practices, and procedures of maintaining a waiting list for placement at ELMHS, which cause \nPlaintiffs to remain incarcerated in correctional facilities in Louisiana for months at a time following an \nNGRI  determination  and  their  commitment  to  a  mental  health  facility,  violates  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act.”. \n51Will v Michigan Dep’t of State Police, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2309-2310 (1989). \n10\n24341 \n\nagainst  DHH  shall  be  dismissed  without  prejudice  on  the  grounds  of  sovereign \nimmunity. \nC. Mootness \nDefendants urge the case is not justiciable owing to mootness.  Defendants \ncontend that, because the named Plaintiffs have now been placed in a mental health \nfacility, the actual controversy has been eliminated rendering the action moot.  Since the \nmootness challenge, however, a similarly situated Plaintiff, Tyrin Perkins, who remains \nincarcerated, has intervened.52  The Court finds that the present situation gives rise to \nan important exception to the mootness doctrine.  This case remains justiciable even \nthough the complained of conduct no longer directly affects the original named Plaintiffs, \nbecause the offending conduct is capable of repetition while at the same time evading \nreview.53 \nOwing to the temporary nature of NGRI individuals being waitlisted for admission \nto  a  mental  health  facility  and  the  possibility  that  release  from  incarceration  and \nassignment to a mental health facility may occur before a Plaintiff’s claims are fully \nadjudicated,  coupled  with  the  fact  that  there  are  continuous  additions  the  class  of \npersons who are adjudicated NGRI and placed on the waitlist for mental health hospital \nbeds, this case presents a classic example of the mootness exception for claims which \nare capable of repetition, yet evade review. Accordingly, the Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) \nMotion to Dismiss on the grounds of mootness shall be DENIED. \n \n \n                                                 \n52 Rec. Doc. 28. \n53 Moore v. Hosemann, 591 F.3d 741, 744 (5th Cir. 2009)(quoting Alvarez v. Smith, 130 S.Ct. 576, 581 \n(2009)(citing Fed. Election Comm’n v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc., 127 S.Ct. 2652 (1911)). \n11\n24341 \n\nD. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss \nDefendants  contend  that  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  allege  facts  showing \ndiscrimination on the part of Kliebert or DHH, or on-going violations of federal law.  \nDefendants’ argue that because article 654 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Conduct \ndoes not specify a time period in which insanity acquittees are to be transferred to a \nmental  institution,  a  claim  of  intentional  discrimination  is  implausible  and  must  be \ndismissed. Defendants further argue that they have not intentionally denied Plaintiffs \nany rights due to their disabilities and counter that the plaintiffs have been provided with \nall necessary accommodations.  Defendants argue that “at all times herein…[plaintiffs] \nreceived a bed to sleep in, clothes, meals, and more importantly, monitoring and jail-\nbased treatment by the District Forensic Coordinators while awaiting placement.”54 \nAt the motion to dismiss stage the Court must accept the well-plead factual \nallegations  as  true,  Defendants’  simple  denial  of  or  disagreement  with  the  factual \nallegations as plead carries no weight in the Court’s determination of whether Plaintiffs \nhave stated a claim.55  The Court views the Complaints in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, resolving all doubts in their favor.56  If the facts as plead allow the Court to \nconclude that it Plaintiff’s claims for relief are “plausible” the Motion must be denied.57 \nAfter  reviewing  the  Complaints,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  have  alleged \nsufficient facts to support their claims at this stage.  The Supreme Court has recognized \nthat unique considerations underlie the commitment of an insanity acquittee, including \n                                                 \n54 Rec. Doc. 8-1, p. 9. \n55 In their memorandum, Defendants argue that “Defendants, Kliebert and DHH, have not discriminated \nagainst the plaintiffs based on their disability or for any other reason;” “Defendants are not intentionally \ndenying Plaintiffs any rights due to their disabilities, nor have Defendants discriminated against Plaintiffs \nbecause  of  Plaintiffs’  disabilities;”  and  “Plaintiffs  are  not  being  excluded,  denied  or  subjected  to \ndiscrimination solely by reason of his or her disability.”  Rec. Doc. 8-1, pp. 7; 9-10. \n56 Tanglewood East Homeowners v. Charles-Thomas, Inc., 849 F.2d 1568, 1572 (5th Cir. 1988). \n57 Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). \n12\n24341 \n\nthat,  persons  deemed  NGRI  may  not  be  punished  because  they  have  not  been \nconvicted of a crime.58   Recently, the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana \nnoted how “state-imposed imprisonment without conviction is a ‘massive curtailment of \nindividual liberty.’”59  Plaintiffs have alleged that as insanity acquittees deemed NGRI \nwho  have  not  been  convicted  of  any  crimes,  Defendants’  policies,  practices,  and \nprocedures which result in the Plaintiffs’ continued confinement in Louisiana correctional \nfacilities while awaiting placement at ELMHS violates their substantive due process \nrights  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.60    They  further  contend  that  Defendants’ \nactions amount to deliberate indifference of the Plaintiffs’ constitutional liberty interests \nto be free from unlawful imprisonment.61   After reviewing the Complaints and accepting \nall well-plead facts as true, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a violation \nof their substantive due process rights as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.   \nThe Fifth Circuit has also explained that “the RA and the ADA are judged under \nthe same legal standards, and the same remedies are available under both acts.”62  For \npurposes of Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims, Plaintiffs must \n                                                 \n58 In Jones v. U.S., 103 S.Ct. 3043, 3052 (1983), the Court held that upon a finding of NGRI by a \npreponderance of the evidence, it is constitutional for the government to continue confinement until the \ncommittee has regained her sanity or is no longer a threat to herself or society.  In reaching this holding, \nthe Court explained that “insanity acquittees constitute a special class that should be treated differently \nfrom other candidates for commitment.” \n59 Advocacy Center for Elderly and Disabled v. Louisiana Dept. of Health and Hospitals, 731 F.Supp.2d \n603. 626 (E.D.La. 2010). \n60 At this stage, the Court does not reach the merits of Plaintiffs’ substantive due process challenge which \nwill require weighing “the individual’s liberty interest against the State’s asserted reasons for restraining \nindividual liberty.”  Youngberg v. Romero, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2460 (1972). \n61 In Foucha v. Louisiana, 112 S.Ct. 1780 (1992) the Supreme Court explained as follows: “[f]reedom \nfrom bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from \narbitrary governmental action. Youngberg v. Romeo, 102 S.Ct. 2452 2458 (1982).  The Supreme Court \nhas also repeatedly recognized “commitment for any purpose constitutes significant deprivation of liberty \ninterest that requires due process protection.” Addington v. Texas, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1810 (1979). \n62 Kemp v. Holder, 610 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 2010). See also, Bascle v. Parish, 2013WL4434911, at *2 \n(E.D.La. Aug. 14, 2013)(“A prima facie case under the RA is operationally identical to the test under the \nADA.  Moreover, ‘the ADA and Rehabilitation Act generally are interpreted in pari materia.’ Indeed, the \nlanguage of both the ADA and the RA is similar, and the remedies, procedures and rights available under \nthe RA are also available under the ADA.”(internal citations omitted)). \n13\n24341 \n\nhave pled facts of the following three elements: (1) Plaintiffs are qualified individuals \nunder the ADA; (2) Plaintiffs are being excluded from participation in, or, is being denied \nbenefits, services, programs, or other activities for which a public entity is responsible or \nis  otherwise  being  discriminated  against  by  the  public  entity;  and  (3)  that  such \nexclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination is by reason of their disability.63   \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have pled that they are qualified individuals due to \ntheir mental illness.  Plaintiffs have further pled that in spite of their mental disabilities, \nthey are being denied access to appropriate mental health treatment while incarcerated \nin correctional facilities, because such facilities cannot provide adequate mental health \ncare to meet their needs.  They have further pled that they are being denied the mental \nhealth  care  they  should  be  receiving  at  ELMHS.    In  support  of  the  third  element, \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the Defendants policies, procedures and actions which result \nin  continued  incarceration  operate  to  discriminate  against  them  because  of  their \ndisability.64  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfactorily pled enough facts “to state \na  claim  to  relief  that  is  plausible  on  its  face”  arising  under  the  ADA  and  RA.  \nAccordingly, Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion shall be denied.   \n   \n                                                 \n63 Melton v. Dall. Area Rapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 671-72 Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Class Action \nComplaint brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the grounds of \nEleventh Amendment Immunity and mootness, and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \non the grounds of mootness. (5th Cir. 2004). \n64 Plaintiffs plead “intentional discrimination. However, the Fifth Circuit makes it clear that “[a] plaintiff \nasserting a private cause of action for violations of the ADA or the [Rehabilitation Act] may only recover \ncompensatory damages upon a showing of intentional discrimination.” Delano-Pyle, 302 F.3d at 574 \n(citing Carter v. Orleans Parish Pub. Sch., 725 F.2d 261, 264 (5th Cir. 1984). However, Plaintiff’s seek \nonly declaratory and injunctive relief in this action; therefore the Court reads Plaintiff’s allegations of \n“intentional discrimination” as embellishment.  \n14\n24341 \n\nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Class \nAction  Complaint  brought  pursuant  to  Rule  12(b)(1)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \nProcedure is hereby GRANTED IN PART, and DENIED IN PART. \nDefendants’  Motion  is  GRANTED  as  to  Plaintiffs’  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  claims \nagainst DHH.

(R. Doc. \n217).  The motion is opposed. (R. Doc. 221). Plaintiffs filed a Reply. (R. Doc. 227).    \nI.  Background \n In these consolidated actions, Plaintiffs, Brandon Cooper, Louis Davenport, Ron Gatlin, \nKenny Swatt, Stephen Zeringue, William Pitzer, Tyrin Perkins, Dominick Perniciaro III, Scott \nFrye, and Ryan Kazemi are individuals who have been diagnosed with mental illness and found \nNot Guilty by Reason of Insanity (“NGRI”) of a criminal offense. (R. Doc. 203 at 1). Plaintiff \nMonica Jackson has been diagnosed with mental illness and was found incompetent to stand trial \nand ordered committed to Feliciana Forensic Facility, but was incarcerated in correctional \nfacilities in Louisiana following that order. (R. Doc. 203 at 1). Plaintiff Advocacy Center (now \nDisability Rights Louisiana) is a private, federally-funded, non-profit corporation, designated by \nLouisiana to serve as the State’s protection and advocacy system for persons with disabilities and \nis a party in the instant consolidated cases as an associational plaintiff. (R. Doc. 203 at 1-2). \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 2 of 11\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants have refused, and are continuing to refuse, to promptly accept \nphysical custody of individuals found NGRI and Incompetent to Stand Trial who have been \nordered to be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility for care and treatment. (R. Doc. 203 at \n2). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ refusal to accept physical custody has resulted and is \nresulting in prolonged and unconstitutional confinement in parish jails, in violation of Plaintiffs’ \nrights to due process under the United States Constitution, Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. (R. Doc. 203 at 2). \nOn September 2, 2016, the parties moved for entry of a Court-approved settlement \nagreement (“Settlement Agreement” or “Consent Decree”). (R. Doc. 196). The Court entered the \nSettlement Agreement into the record on November 17, 2016. (R. Doc. 203). Under Paragraph \n50 of the Settlement Agreement, the Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement \nAgreement “until this matter is dismissed after four (4) continuous years of Defendants’ \nsubstantial compliance with this Settlement Agreement.” (R. Doc. 203 at 18).  \nGiven the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in Louisiana, beginning in March 2020, \nPlaintiffs requested information regarding delays and cessations in transfers, as well as infection \ncontrol efforts at Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (“ELMHS”), and sought \nimplementation of a remedial action plan under Paragraph 9 of the Settlement Agreement.1 (See \nR. Docs. 217-3, 217-4, 217-5, 217-6). Defendants responded by providing certain information, \nand stated that they had commenced the implementation of a plan approved by state \nepidemiology to resume admissions to ELMHS on a limited basis. (R. Doc. 217-7, 217-8).   \n \n1 Under Paragraph 9 of the Settlement Agreement, “[i]f the monthly reporting provisions below demonstrate \nadmission times regularly exceeding 15 calendar days, the Plaintiffs may, at their option, call a meeting with \nDefendants to devise a remedial action plan to bring admission times within the 15-day threshold.” (R. Doc. 203 at \n8, ¶ 9). \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 3 of 11\nOn November 16, 2020, Plaintiff filed an Unopposed Motion for Continued Reporting \nand Jurisdiction Over the Settlement Agreement and Notice of Negotiations Related to a \nSupplemental Agreement. (R. Doc. 208). Among other things, the parties represented that \n“Defendants have been unable to maintain substantial compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement including providing [Behavioral Health Assessments (“BHAs”)] and placements of \nincompetent and NGRI individuals within the timelines required by Paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 of the \nSettlement Agreement due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.” (R. Doc. 208 at 2). Plaintiffs \nrequested the Court to “continue the reporting provisions and the Court’s jurisdiction over the \nenforcement of the original Settlement Agreement beyond November 16, 2020, until such time \nan agreement may be reached by the parties or negotiations reach an impasse requiring the \nintervention of the Court.” (R. Doc. 208 at 4). The district judge granted the motion, stating that \n“the Court’s jurisdiction over the settlement agreement and the reporting provisions therein shall \nremain in effect pending the parties’ negotiations.” (R. Doc. 210). \nOn February 22, 2021, Plaintiffs circulated a proposed draft supplement to the Settlement \nAgreement, which outlines specific actions to assist Defendants in returning to compliance with \nthe Settlement Agreement and the development of supporting documentation. (R. Doc. 217-10). \nThe parties then negotiated the terms of this proposed supplement. (R. Doc. 217-1 at 12-14; see \nR. Docs. 217-10, 217-11, 217-12, 217-13, 217-14). Plaintiffs assert that Defendants’ “redlined, \ndetailed counter proposal” provided on May 7, 2021 “made clear that they had no interest in \nnegotiating a supplemental settlement agreement in good faith.” (R. Doc. 217-1 at 14). \n  On June 12, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Reopen Discovery. (R. Doc. 217).   \nThere is no dispute that the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (“LDH”) remained in \nsubstantial compliance with the Settlement agreement from the onset of the Settlement \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 4 of 11\nAgreement in November 2016 to March 2020. There is also no dispute that LDH is currently not \nin compliance with Paragraphs 6, 8, 9, 15 of the Settlement Agreement, which respectively \nrequire Defendants to do the following:  \n•  Provide all NGRI or Incompetent Individuals a Behavioral Health Assessment (“BHA”) \nwithin five (5) calendar days of notification of an order for inpatient treatment or order of \ncommitment.  (R. Doc. 203 at 7, ¶ 6). \n \n•  Admit all new NGRI or Incompetent Individuals with Emergency Mental Health Needs \nto a Mental Health Facility within two (2) business days following completion of a BHA. \n(R. Doc. 203 at 7-8, ¶ 8). \n \n•  Admit all NGRI or Incompetent Individuals to the forensic unit at Eastern Louisiana \nMental Health System (“ELMHS”) or other mental health facility, or to an appropriate \ncommunity-based program within fifteen (15) calendar days following receipt of an \nOrder. (R. Doc. 203 at 8, ¶ 9). \n \n•  Create new placement options, in addition to and not in lieu of current placement \nopportunities, at clinically and legally suitable locations – including community-based \nsettings – to prevent unnecessary detention of NGRI and Incompetent Individuals in jails \nor confinement in Mental Health Facilities. (R. Doc. 203 at 10-11, ¶ 15). \n \n(R. Doc. 217 at 2-3; R. Doc. 221 at 1-2, 17-18).   \nPlaintiffs argue that the parties’ “efforts to confect an agreement designed to assist the \nDefendants in returning to compliance with the goals of the Settlement Agreement in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and the shifts in hospital functioning attendant on social distancing, \nquarantine and other infection control measures” have failed. (R. Doc. 217 at 3). Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs request that the Court re-open discovery to allow Plaintiffs to seek information related \nto the following categories of discovery:  \n•  NGRI Individuals who were discharged to community placements.  \n•  Tracking COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, quarantines, contract tracing, and other \ninfection control measures employed at ELMHS and community placements, and for \nNGRI and Incompetent Individuals on the waitlist awaiting transfer to ELMHS or other \nmental health facility or to an appropriate community-based program.  \n•  Policies and procedures related to tracking BHA provision at all jails within Louisiana.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 5 of 11\n \n•  Auditing or reviewing of ELMHS’ intake, post-admission assessment, and discharge \npolicies and procedures.  \n•  Defendants’ planning efforts to address or resolve the waiting lists of NGRI and \nIncompetent Individuals in local jails awaiting transfer to a mental health placement.  \n•  Halting or limiting admission and / or discharge to and from ELMHS and/or community \nplacements.  \n•  Patient flow between local jails, ELMHS and community placements.  \n•  Planning for creation of additional placements, including budget requests, Requests for \nProposals, and assessments of potential placement sites.  \n \n(R. Doc. 217 at 4-5). Plaintiffs also seek a hearing “for a rule to show cause why Defendants \nshould not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the Settlement Agreement.” (R. Doc. \n217 at 6). \n  In opposition, Defendants argue that they should not be held in contempt because LDH’s \ncompliance issues arise “solely from restrictions imposed due to the unforeseeable, \nunprecedented world-wide COVID-19 pandemic,” and LDH had otherwise “been in substantial \ncompliance for 3.5 years until it had to follow Center for Disease Control and Prevention \n(“CDC”) guidelines for congregate settings, as well as local quarantine protocols and mandates \nto lessen the spread of COVID-19 to protect the public, including employees working in \ncongregate settings and individuals in congregate settings.” (R. Doc. 221 at 1-2). Defendants \nargue that substantial compliance with the Settlement Agreement became impossible in light of \nthe restrictions on the various components of the criminal justice system emplaced during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, and provide significant details regarding their efforts to comply with the \nSettlement Agreement. (R. Doc. 221 at 3-19). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs are not entitled to \nadditional discovery in light of Defendants’ efforts at communication, the irrelevance of certain \ndiscovery sought with respect to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and the impossibility of \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 6 of 11\nperformance. (R. Doc. 221 at 19-24). Finally, Defendants argue that LDH has acted in good faith \nand should not be held in contempt. (R. Doc. 221 at 24-25).  \n  In reply, Plaintiffs argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is not a “fortuitous event” under \nLouisiana law that would relieve Defendants of their obligations under the Settlement Agreement \nand that Defendants have failed to provide information critical to assessing compliance with the \nSettlement Agreement. (R. Doc. 225). \nII.  Law and Analysis \nA.  Impossibility of Performance \nAs a preliminary issue, Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s requests for post-judgment \ndiscovery should be denied because the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a “fortuitous event that \nmakes performance impossible” under Louisiana Civil Code article 1873. (R. Doc. 221 at 18-19, \n23-24).  \n Consent decrees are construed according to “general principles of contract \ninterpretation.” Frew v. Janek, 780 F.3d 320, 327 (5th Cir. 2015). There is no dispute that \nLouisiana law applies to the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement \nAgreement does not contain a force majeure provision, so the Court will look to the relevant \nLouisiana law on impossibility of performance.  \nUnder Louisiana law, “[a]n obligor is not liable for his failure to perform when it is \ncaused by a fortuitous event that makes performance impossible. An obligor is, however, liable \nfor his failure to perform when he has assumed the risk of such a fortuitous event.” La. Civ. \nCode. Art. 1873. “A fortuitous event is one that, at the time the contract was made, could not \nhave been reasonably foreseen.” La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1875. Nevertheless, “[t]he \nnonperformance of a contract is not excused by a fortuitous event where it may be carried into \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 7 of 11\neffect, although not in the manner contemplated by the obligor at the time the contract was \nentered into.” Payne v. Hurwitz, 978 So. 2d 1000, 1005 (La. App. 1st Cir. 2008)(citing Dallas \nCooperage & Woodenware Co. v. Creston Hoop Co., 109 So. 844, 844 (1926)). “In other words, \nif the fortuitous event prevents the obligor from performing his obligation in the manner \ncontemplated at the time of contracting, he must pursue reasonable alternatives to render \nperformance in a different manner before he can take advantage of the defense of impossibility.” \nId. (citing West v. Cent La. Limousine Serv., Inc., 856 So.2d 203,205 (La. App. 3rd Cir. 2003)). \n“An obligor is not released from his duty to perform under a contract by the mere fact that such \nperformance has been made more difficult or more burdensome by a fortuitous event.” Id. (citing \nSchenck v. Capri Constr. Co., 194 So.2d 378, 380 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1967). \nIn determining whether to allow post-judgment discovery, the Court need not reach the \nissue of whether the COVID-19 pandemic, and corresponding government shutdowns, was an \nunforeseen, fortuitous event that rendered Defendants’ performance under the Settlement \nAgreement impossible. The issue before the Court is whether to allow Plaintiffs to conduct post-\njudgment discovery in light of Defendants’ admitted failure to perform, not whether the COVID-\n19 pandemic excused such performance. Defendants have not sought modification of the terms \nof the Settlement Agreement, whether under Rule 60(b) or otherwise, in light of the COVID-19 \npandemic. \nThe record indicates that the parties have been negotiating how to handle compliance \nwith the Settlement Agreement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year. While \nDefendants’ arguments regarding impossibility of performance may ultimately support \nmodification of the Settlement Agreement, or provide a defense to a finding of contempt, they do \nnot preclude a ruling requiring post-judgment discovery regarding Defendants’ failure to \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 8 of 11\nperform. Indeed, post-judgment discovery may bear on whether and to what extent Defendants’ \ndefense of impossibility of performance is merited if raised in an appropriate motion.  \n  B.   Post-Judgment Discovery \nA federal district court possess the power to enforce its judgments, including consent \ndecrees. Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 432 (2004) (“Federal courts are not \nreduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance. Once entered, that decree may \nbe enforced.”); United States v. Alcoa, Inc., 533 F.3d 278, 286 (5th Cir. 2008) (“[D]istrict courts \nhave the power and ordinarily must hold parties to the terms of a consent decree.”). “The rules \ngoverning discovery in postjudgment execution proceedings are quite permissive.” Republic of \nArgentina v. NML Cap., Ltd., 573 U.S. 134, 138 (2014). \nA district court may enforce its judgments by allowing post-judgment discovery. Caliste \nv. Cantrell, No. 17-6197, 2020 WL 814860, at *3 (E.D. La. Feb. 19, 2020).  Rule 69(a)(2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[i]n aid of the judgment or execution, the \njudgment creditor or a successor in interest whose interest appears of record may obtain \ndiscovery from any person—including the judgment debtor—as provided in these rules or by the \nprocedure of the state where the court is located.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a)(2). “Post-judgment \ndiscovery serves as an important tool to monitor a party’s compliance with the court’s order.” \nCaliste, 2020 WL 814860, at *3 (citing Brumfield v. Dodd, No. 71-1316, 2013 WL 360572, at *3 \n(E.D. La. Jan. 30, 2013)).  \nNotwithstanding Defendants’ detailed explanations regarding the issues crated by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, there is no dispute that Defendants are not in compliance with Paragraphs \n6, 8, 9, 15 of the Settlement Agreement. Allowing Plaintiff to conduct limited post-judgment \ndiscovery with respect to the bases for Defendants’ non-compliance with the Settlement \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 9 of 11\nAgreement would “aid [in] the judgment or execution” of the Settlement Agreement. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 69(a)(2). Having considered the record, the Court finds that there is good cause to allow \npost-judgment discovery in light of Defendants’ failure to comply with the Settlement \nAgreement. See Caliste, 2020 WL 814860, at *4 (finding “good cause” to allow post-judgment \ndiscovery under Rule 69(a)(2) where the plaintiffs sought to demonstrate that the defendant had \nviolated the terms of a consent decree). \n“While post-judgment discovery is broad, it is not without limits.” JP Morgan Chase \nBank, N.A. v. DataTreasury Corp., 936 F.3d 251, 259 (5th Cir. 2019) (district judge did not \nabuse discretion in limiting post-judgment discovery in light of proportionality requirement of \nRule 26(b)(1)). The Court will limit discovery to the purported non-compliance with Paragraphs \n6, 8, 9, 15 of the Settlement Agreement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reasons for \nsuch non-compliance. Such discovery is relevant to the issue of whether judicial enforcement or \nmodification of the Settlement Agreement is warranted in light of the ongoing COVID-19 \npandemic, and whether a finding of contempt is warranted in light of Defendants’ non-\ncompliance with the terms of Paragraphs 6, 8, 9, 15 of the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs are \ncautioned to narrowly draft their discovery requests and not seek information already provided \nby Defendants.  \nC.  Finding of Contempt \nDistrict courts have wide discretion in how to enforce consent decrees and implement \nremedies for their violation, including a finding of contempt for failing to meet deadlines set by \nthe consent decree. Alcoa, 533 F.3d at 286. \n“The movant in a civil contempt proceeding bears the burden of establishing by clear and \nconvincing evidence: (1) that a court order was in effect; (2) that the order required certain \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 10 of 11\nconduct by the respondent; and (3) that the respondent failed to comply with the court’s order.” \nPetroleos Mexicanos v. Crawford Enters., Inc., 826 F.2d 392, 401 (5th Cir. 1987). Clear and \nconvincing evidence is defined as the “weight of proof which ‘produces in the mind of the trier \nof fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, \nevidence so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable the fact finder to come to a \nclear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts’ of the case.” Travelhost, Inc. \nv. Blandford, 68 F.3d 958, 961 (5th Cir. 1995) (citing In re Medrano, 956 F.2d 101, 102 (5th Cir. \n1992)). “When a party violates a court order without objecting to it, asking the court to modify or \nvacate it, or even informing the court why it cannot or will not obey it, the court may hold the \nparty in contempt without first deciding whether the disobedience was justified.” Seven Arts \nPictures, Inc. v. Jonesfilm, 512 F. App’x 419, 422 (5th Cir. 2013) \nHaving granted Plaintiffs’ request to conduct post-judgment discovery, the Court will not \nreach the issue of whether Defendant should be held in contempt. “Instead of granting both \nrequests at once, a more sensible approach is to allow discovery in order to determine whether a \ncontempt finding is warranted.” Caliste, 2020 WL 814860, at *5. A finding of contempt would \nbe premature until more conclusive evidence emerges through post-judgment discovery. Id.; see \nMatter of Baum, 606 F.2d 592, 593 (5th Cir. 1979) (“The judicial contempt power is a potent \nweapon which should not be used if the court’s order upon which the contempt was founded is \nvague or ambiguous.”) (citing Int'l Longshoreman’s Assoc. v. Phila. Marine Trade Assoc., 389 \nU.S. 64, 76, 88 (1967)). Nevertheless, the Court reserves the authority to issue a contempt \nfinding in the event evidence emerges that a party “failed to comply with the court's order.” \nPetroleos, 826 F.2d at 401. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:14-cv-00507-SDD-RLB     Document 226    09/27/21   Page 11 of 11\nIII.  Conclusion \n  Based on the foregoing, \n  IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motion to Reopen Discovery and Rule to Show Cause \nWhy Defendants Should Not be Held in Contempt (R. Doc. 217) is GRANTED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART. The parties may conduct post-judgment discovery within the scope of Rule \n26(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. All post-judgment discovery shall be completed \nby December 1, 2021. The parties are encouraged to continue the negotiation of a reasonable \nand appropriate modification of the Settlement Agreement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIf warranted, Plaintiffs may renew their request to find Defendants in contempt after the close of \npost-judgment discovery.  \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 27, 2021. \nS \nRICHARD L.
