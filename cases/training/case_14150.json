      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nAssistant Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW - RFK \nWashington, DC  20530 \nOctober 31, 2008 \nMs. Yvonne B. Burke, Chairperson\nLos Angeles County Board of Supervisors\n500 West Temple Street, Suite 856\nLos Angeles, CA  90012 \nRe:  Investigation of the Los Angeles County Probation Camps \nDear Ms. Burke: \nI write to report the findings of the Civil Rights\nDivision’s investigation of conditions at the Los Angeles County\nProbation Camps (“the Camps”).  On November 9, 2006, we notified\nyou of our intent to conduct an investigation of the Camps\npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act,\n42 U.S.C. § 1997 (“CRIPA”), and the Violent Crime Control and Law\nEnforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“Section 14141\").  We \ninformed you that our investigation of the Camps would focus on\nwhether youth were adequately protected from harm.  As we noted,\nboth CRIPA and Section 14141 give the Department of Justice\n(“the Department”) authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or\npractice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal\nstatutory rights of youth in juvenile justice institutions. \nPrior to the investigatory tours, the Department and Los\nAngeles County (“the County”) agreed that the Department would\ntour a sample of the Camps, and that the Department’s inspection\nof the sample would stand as representative of all of the Camps.1  \nOn January 22-26, February 5-8, and March 5-8, 2007, we conducted\non-site inspections of Camp Vernon Kilpatrick (“Camp\nKilpatrick”), Camp Joseph Scott (“Camp Scott”), and Camp Karl\nHolton (“Camp Holton”), as well as five of the camps at the\nChallenger Memorial Youth Center (“Challenger” or “the Challenger\nCamps”).  We toured with expert consultants in juvenile justice \n1  The Los Angeles County Probation Camps include 19\njuvenile justice facilities.   The Department toured eight of\nthem. \n\n-2-\nadministration and, at the Challenger Camps, an expert consultant\nin mental health.  Before, during, and after our visit, we\nreviewed an extensive number of documents including, but not\nlimited to, policies and procedures, incident reports, housing\nlogs, and orientation materials.  However, the County refused to\nprovide us access to all child abuse investigations and to some\nmedical records and logs.2  Additionally, in conducting our on-\nsite investigations, we interviewed administrators,\nprofessionals, staff, and youth.  We observed the youth in a\nvariety of settings, including on their living units, while\ndining, in classrooms, and during recreation. \nConsistent with our commitment to provide technical\nassistance and conduct a transparent investigation, we conducted\nexit conferences at each facility we visited upon the conclusion\nof the tour, during which our expert consultants conveyed their\ninitial impressions and concerns. \nUnder the leadership of Robert Taylor, Chief Probation\nOfficer of the Los Angeles County Probation Department\n(“Probation Department”), the County has unequivocally indicated\nits clear desire to improve the facilities.  We commend the \nProbation Department staff for their helpful, courteous, and\nprofessional conduct throughout the course of this investigation.\nWe hope to continue to work with the County and facility staff in\nthe same cooperative manner going forward. \nConsistent with our statutory obligation under CRIPA, we set\nforth below the findings of our investigation, the facts\nsupporting them, and the minimum remedial steps that are\nnecessary to address the deficiencies we have identified.  As \ndescribed below, we conclude that youth confined at the Los\nAngeles Juvenile Camps suffer harm or the risk of harm from\nconstitutional deficiencies, specifically in the areas of\nprotection from harm and mental health care.  Notwithstanding the \n2  By law, our investigation must proceed regardless of\nwhether County officials choose to cooperate fully.  Indeed, when\nCRIPA was enacted, lawmakers considered the possibility that\nState and local officials might not cooperate in our federal\ninvestigations.  See H.R. Conf. Rep. 96-897, at 12 (1980),\nreprinted in 1980 U.S.S.C.A.N. 832, 836.  As we informed the \nCounty’s attorney, the County’s decision to deny us access to\nthese records permits us to draw negative inferences about their\ncontents.  We have drawn negative inferences with respect to the\nadequacy of abuse investigations and the adequacy of the\ndiscipline for staff who violate the rights of youth. \n\n-3-\nforegoing, we are pleased that the County informed us of some\npreliminary steps it intends to take to remedy deficiencies we\nreported during our exit conferences. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Description of the Facilities \nThe Los Angeles County Probation Department operates 19\ndetention camps.  Approximately 2,200 post-adjudicated youth are\nhoused in the Camps, which provide an intermediate sanction\nbetween community supervision and detention in the secure\nfacilities operated by the California Department of Corrections\nand Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice.  The Probation \nDepartment also operates the Los Angeles County Juvenile Halls\n(“Juvenile Halls”), which house approximately 1,500 to 1,800\nyouth who generally range in age from 11 to 19 and are awaiting\nadjudication.3  Many youth from the Halls are transferred to the\nCamps following adjudication. \n \n1.  THE CHALLENGER CAMPS \nThe Challenger Camps are six separate camps located on 44\nacres in the town of Lancaster in Los Angeles County’s Antelope\nValley.  In January 2007, one of the six camps, Camp Onizuka,\nwhich housed girls, was closed.  The remaining five camps -\nJarvis, McNair, Resnick, Scobee and Smith - have the capacity to\nhouse 110 youth each. \nEach camp is a large, concrete, single-story facility,\nconfigured in a semi-circle, divided in half by a continuous line\nof classrooms.  The classrooms divide the facility into two\nidentical halves, each with a large grass field area in its\ncenter.  There are three camps on each side of the facility’s\ndivide.  Although all youth in each camp move to school and to\noutdoor recreation together, programming and meals are conducted\nseparately in the dayrooms of each side of each camp. \nYouth housed at the Challenger Camps tend to include those\nwith histories of violence and/or escape.  All youth with medical\nand mental health needs are housed in the Challenger Camps.  A \nsignificant percentage of the population is prescribed \n3  On August 26, 2004, the Department, Los Angeles County,\nand the Los Angeles County Office of Education entered into an\nagreement to resolve the Department’s investigation regarding\nconditions of confinement at the Juvenile Halls. \n\n-4-\npsychotropic medication.  Youth housed at the Challenger Camps\nrange in age from 14 to 18 and most are fulfilling commitments of\nthree, six, or nine months. \nThere is also a 60-bed disciplinary unit called a Special\nHousing Unit (“SHU”) that operates as a separate program at the\nChallenger Camps.  The SHU also serves as a local detention \nfacility for up to 10 youth arrested by police in the community\nimmediately surrounding the Challenger Camps. \n2.  CAMP SCOTT \nCamp Scott is a secure facility for girls located in the\nrural Santa Clarita community of Los Angeles County.  Camp Scott\nis configured as a semi-circle of single story buildings.  Camp\nScott has a rated capacity of 125 youth, although the population\non the first day of our visit was 79 youth.  The girls, who range\nin age from 12 to 18, sleep in a single dorm designed to house up\nto 113 youth.  Girls are generally committed to Camp Scott for\nperiods of three, six, or nine months.  The newest building on\nthe campus is an Assessment Center (which also functions as a\ndisciplinary housing unit), with a capacity of 12 youth housed in\nsingle cells.  All of the camp’s buildings open onto the main\ngrass field and recreation area.  Girls are able to walk the \nshort distances from their dorm to the school, culinary unit,\nadministration building, assessment center, and other buildings\non the campus. \n3.   CAMP HOLTON \nCamp Holton is located in the rural Sylmar community of Los\nAngeles County.  This secure, all male facility is constructed\nlargely of cinderblock with a single dorm used as living quarters\nfor all youth.  Although the facility can house up to 119 youth,\n77 were assigned to the facility on the first day of our tour.\nYouth are typically committed to the camp for three, six, or nine\nmonths, with an average length of stay reported to be\napproximately 90 days.  The single dorm is divided into four\nsections, each with approximately 25 bunks.  The sections are \nseparated by a low, cinderblock wall running down the center of\nthe dorm with a control center located in the middle of the dorm. \nYouth ages 13 and under tend to be housed in one quadrant of the\ndorm while honors youth occupy another and general population\nyouth occupy the remaining two quadrants.4   The various buildings \n4  At the time of our visit, it appears that the youngest\nyouth housed in the camps we toured was 12 years old. \n\n-5-\nthat make up the facility - - the school, administrative area,\nculinary unit, Special Housing Unit and a gym - - are arranged in\na fully enclosed, semi-circle around a large, open area with\nbasketball courts, a track, and a grass field for recreation.\nYouth walk the relatively short distances from building to\nbuilding. \n4.  CAMP KILPATRICK \nCamp Kilpatrick is a secure facility for boys built in 1964\nin the hills of Los Angeles County’s Malibu community.  The \nfacility is unique among the Camps because of its focus on\nsports; Kilpatrick is a certified high school and its sports\nteams compete with area high schools in football, basketball,\nbaseball, and soccer, at both the junior varsity and varsity\nlevels.  Built mostly of cinderblock, the facility is in a\ngeneral state of physical and cosmetic disrepair.  For example,\nthe gymnasium was rendered structurally unsound after an\nearthquake in 1994 and has not been usable since. \nKilpatrick is configured in a fully enclosed, semi-circular\nfashion around a large dirt field and basketball courts.  The \nfacility’s rated capacity is 112 youth, although only 91 were\nassigned on the first day of our tour.  The youth ranged in age\nfrom 13 to 18 years old.  Youth are assigned to one of two\nidentical dorms, based largely on programming preferences.  Each \ndorm houses approximately 45 youth in single bunks arranged in\nfour rows with a control center in the middle of each dorm.  The \nvarious buildings that make up the facility - - the school,\nculinary unit, administration building, and Special Housing Unit\n- - open on to the field and recreational space and each is\nwithin easy walking distance to the dorms.  Youth at Kilpatrick\nare typically committed for periods of three, six, or nine\nmonths, with three-month commitments being the most common.  Camp\nKilpatrick is next to Camp Miller, with which it shares kitchen\nfacilities and its Special Housing Unit, although the camps\noperate as two separate and distinct camp programs. \nB.  Legal Background \nCRIPA gives the Department of Justice authority to\ninvestigate and take appropriate action to enforce the\nconstitutional rights and the federal statutory rights of\njuveniles in juvenile justice facilities.  42 U.S.C. § 1997.\nSection 14141 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \nAct of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141, makes it unlawful for any\ngovernmental authority with responsibility for the incarceration\nof juveniles to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that \n\n-6-\ndeprives incarcerated juveniles of constitutional or federal\nstatutory rights.  Section 14141 grants the Attorney General\nauthority to file a civil action to eliminate the pattern or\npractice. \nThe Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution governs the standards for conditions of\nconfinement of juvenile offenders who have not been convicted of\na crime.  Gary H. v. Hegstrom, 831 F.2d 1430, 1432 (9th Cir.\n1987); Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 931 (9th Cir. 2004).\nConfinement of youth in conditions that amount to punishment, or\nin conditions that represent a substantial departure from\ngenerally accepted professional standards, violates the Due\nProcess clause.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982); Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979); Alexander S. v. Boyd, 876 F. Supp.\n773, 796-799 (D.S.C. 1995), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on\nother grounds, 113 F.3d 1373 (4th Cir. 1997).  The Fourteenth \nAmendment prohibits imposing on incarcerated persons who have not\nbeen convicted of crimes conditions or practices not reasonably\nrelated to the legitimate governmental objectives of safety,\norder, and security.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 539-540. \nThe County has an obligation to assure the reasonable\nhealth, safety, and freedom from undue restraint of the youth in\nits custody.  See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982); Gary \nH. v. Hegstrom, 831 F.2d 1430 (9th Cir. 1987); Alexander S. v. \nBoyd, 876 F. Supp. at 786-7; Santana v. Collazo, 793 F.2d 41\n(1st Cir. 1984); D.B. v. Tewksbury, 545 F. Supp. 896 (D. Or.\n1982).  Confined juveniles must receive adequate medical\ntreatment, including adequate mental health treatment and suicide\nprevention measures.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323-24 & n.30;\nOregon Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1120 (9th Cir.\n2003); Gibson v. County of Washoe, 290 F.3d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir.\n2002); Carnell v. Grimm, 74 F.3d 977, 978-79 (9th Cir. 1996);\nCabrales v. County of Los Angeles, 864 F.2d 1454 (9th Cir. 1988),\nvacated and remanded, 490 U.S. 1087 (1989), reinstated, 886 F.2d\n235 (9th Cir. 1989); Horn v. Madison County Fiscal Court, 22 F.3d\n653, 660 (6th Cir. 1994); Gordon v. Kidd, 971 F.2d 1087, 1094\n(4th Cir. 1992). \nII.  FINDINGS \nYouth residing in Los Angeles County’s Camps are not\nadequately protected from harm.  Further, the County fails to\nprovide adequate suicide prevention and mental health care to\nyouth. \n\n-7-\nA.  Failure to Protect Youth From Harm \nYouth housed at the Camps are subjected to harm and risk of\nharm as a result of the following failures by the County:\n(1) failure to protect youth from harm by staff, including\nfailure to protect youth from use of excessive force by staff,\nexcessive and inappropriate use of Oleoresin Capsicum (“OC”)\nspray, and staff misconduct at Camp Holton; (2) failure to\nprotect youth from harm by other youth; (3) failure to provide\nadequate staffing; (4) failure to provide adequate staff\ntraining; (5) failure to adequately investigate allegations of\nabuse; (6) failure to provide an adequate classification system;\nand (7) failure to provide an adequate grievance process. \n1.  Failure to Protect Youth From Harm by Staff \na.  Use of Excessive Force by Staff  \nYouth at the Camps have a right to be free from unnecessary\nrestraint and the use of excessive force.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at\n315-16.  With the noteworthy exception of Camp Kilpatrick, our\ninvestigation uncovered systemic physical abuse of youth by\nstaff.  We found a disturbing consistency in the youth’s accounts\nof the use of unnecessary physical restraint and excessive force\nby staff at the Camps.  Most of the youth we interviewed reported\nstaff abuse they had received themselves or had witnessed.  Youth \nrepeatedly corroborated each other’s allegations in separate\ninterviews, with no opportunity to discuss the allegations\nbetween interviews.  In each instance, we attempted to track down\nwhether the abuse had been reported (by reviewing the Suspected\nChild Abuse Report (“SCAR”) forms we received from the County),\nor a grievance had been filed.  Some allegations had been\nreported to or discovered by the County.  Others, for various\nreasons, were reported to us in the first instance, suggesting\nboth that youth lack trust in the County to report abuse and that\nthe County systemically fails to detect abuse occurring at the\nCamps. \ni.  The Five Challenger Camps \nAt the Challenger Camps, many of the youth we interviewed\nreported several allegations of mistreatment at the hands of\nstaff.  Other youth witnesses corroborated the original youth’s\naccounts of these events.  In two instances that we describe \nbelow, staff knew about the incidents, yet did not take the\nrequired steps to report them to the Los Angeles Department of\nChildren and Family Services (“DCFS”) or initiate an \n\n-8-\ninvestigation.  Generally, we found that staff did not understand\ntheir responsibilities as mandatory child abuse reporters or know\nwhat procedures to follow when receiving an allegation of abuse.\nAs a result, the protections that would have been afforded by\nDCFS involvement were never accessed, and youth reported that\nthey did not feel safe enough to voice their concerns about\nmistreatment directly to staff.  Consider the following\nillustrative examples: \n \n• \t B.P.5 reported that a Camp McNair probation officer,\nwhile attempting to restrain L.N., slammed L.N. to the\nground and dislocated the youth’s shoulder.  L.N. \nreported that the incident occurred in December 2006 in\nthe dining hall after another youth threatened to spit\nin his food.  He stated that he got mad and started\nfighting the youth.  L.N. reported that staff ordered\nthe youth to stop fighting and that L.N. complied by\nbacking away from the other youth.  Nevertheless, the\nofficer grabbed him and slammed him to the floor on his\nshoulder.6  (We observed a bone sticking out of L.N.’s\nshoulder.  He told us that he was seen by camp medical\nstaff and told that he would have to see a bone \nspecialist). \n \t\n• One youth described being given what he believed was a\nnew jacket by a member of the staff, but learned later\nthat the jacket actually belonged to another youth in\nthe camp.  The other youth demanded that his jacket be\nreturned.  The reporting youth refused.  The two youth\nfought soon thereafter.  The staff member who had given \n5  The initials used to refer to youth are pseudonyms to\nprotect their privacy.  We will provide a key to the youth’s real\nnames to the County under separate cover. \n6  Youth reported that staff “slam” youth in the following\nmanner:  Youth are either slammed against the wall, or staff grab\nyouth, lift them in the air, and forcibly take them to the\nground.  In some cases, officers land on top of youth, injuring\nboth the youth and the officers involved in the process.  As \ndiscussed below, staff at all of the Camps consistently reported\nto us that the Probation Department did not have a use of force\ncontinuum and that staff had received no additional training on\nuse of force techniques after their initial new hire training.\nAbusive practices such as “slamming” are the predictable\nconsequences of a systemic lack of adequate training on the use\nof force. \n\n-9-\nthe jacket to the first youth intervened by physically\ntaking one youth to the ground.  The youth reported\nthat, during this contact, he suffered a broken jaw.\nFacility administrators reported that although staff\nknew about this incident, they had not investigated the\nveracity of any complaints of excessive force or that\nthe staff had purposefully instigated the incident.\nWith our urging, the Probation Department’s Special\nInvestigations Unit (“SIU”) was notified of this\nincident. \n \t\n• V.T. reportedly observed staff physically restrain a\nyouth in the dining hall because the youth continued to\ntalk after being instructed to be quiet.  After the \nrestraint, V.T. reported that he observed the youth\nwith a bloody mouth and a “knot” on his forehead. \n \t\n• A.K. reported that two Camp Resnick probation officers\nallegedly punched, kicked, and sprayed a youth with OC\nwhile he was handcuffed. \nYouth reported the following incidents at Camp Smith: \n \t\n• L.O. alleged that he was grabbed, slammed, and dragged\nacross the control center steps in Camp Smith because\nhe refused to exercise with the dorm. \n \t\n• Youth reported observing staff break a youth’s jaw and\nbeat him while restraining him (the youth purportedly\nsuffered a broken jaw after staff allegedly “slammed”\nthe youth to the ground). \n \t\n• C.R. reported that he observed staff beat a youth who\nhad assumed the “OC [Oleoresin Capsicum spray]\nposition”7 on the ground. \nWe received additional noteworthy reports of staff-on-youth\nassaults at Camp McNair, such as the following: \n7  Staff order youth to assume the “OC position” as a\nmeans of gaining control of the youth, meaning that the youth\nmust immediately lie down on the floor in the prone position with\nhis eyes shut. \n\n-10-\n \t\n• N.T. alleged that in December 2006, a Camp McNair\nprobation officer caught two youth “locking legs.”8  The \nofficer “slammed them,” sprayed them with OC, and\nkicked them. \n \t\n• J.I. allegedly witnessed staff members using excessive\nforce on V.T.   J.I. observed that, following the use of\nforce, V.T. had a bloody mouth and a big knot on his\nforehead. \n \t\n• F.D. alleged that he was physically assaulted by staff\nfor no reason.  The youth is visibly physically\ndisabled, and of short stature.  He reported suffering\nfrom a bone weakening disease that causes his bones to\nbe fragile and undeveloped.  Staff allegedly dragged\nF.D. across the recreation field, causing severe injury\nto his knee.  The County began an investigation of this\nincident after we brought it to the County’s attention.\nThe County preliminarily reported after our exit\nconference that F.D. was suspected of drug possession.\nThe County agreed, however, that regardless of the\nyouth’s offense, the staff should have handled the\nincident differently. \nThe allegations described above had indicia of credibility\nand we did not receive any documents refuting these accounts.\nMore generally, allegations like these, both founded and\nunfounded, are not uncommon in secure facilities such as the\nCamps.  It is therefore essential, for the protection of the\nyouth and the staff, that such allegations be promptly and\nproperly reported, and thoroughly investigated.  For this to \noccur, staff must understand their legal obligations in this\nregard and must know the formal steps required to properly report\nincidents of alleged child abuse. \n \t\nii. Camp Holton \nWe also uncovered abusive practices at Camp Holton.  Youth \nreported that some staff verbally and physically mistreated youth\nwhen their drill performance fell below expectations.  Youth \n8  “Locking legs” is a discreet method of fighting where\nyouth sit on the ground or on a bunk facing each other and\ninterlock their legs at the knee so only a few inches separate\nthem.  They then begin to hit each other.  The loser is \ndetermined, in part, by which youth first “unlocks” his or her\nlegs and moves away. \n\n-11-\nrevealed that some staff become agitated and impatient with youth\nwhen “facing movements” (a method of lining up youth in formation\nand moving them safely and efficiently from building to building)\nand when other required regimens are not carried out in a swift\nand organized manner. \nAdditionally, we uncovered a number of disturbing\nallegations of staff assault.  These allegations include: \n \t\n• One 15-year-old youth stated that staff kicked him\ntwice in the ribs during his first week at Camp Holton.\nHe explained that while he was in the dorm during\nshower time, staff allegedly directed him and others to\nline up.  Because he did not line up quickly enough,\nstaff allegedly directed him to come to the control\ncenter area.  Upon arriving at the control area, which\nis a slightly elevated staff observation area\nsurrounded by a wall standing approximately four feet\nin height, staff directed the youth to sit in a chair\nagainst the wall.  This positioning made it difficult\nfor other youth in the dorm or the video surveillance\nsystem to observe the youth.  While seated, the youth\nreported that a staff member kicked him twice in the\nribs and slapped him once on the back of his head with\nan open hand. \n \t\n• Another youth reported that in February 2007, a staff\nmember reportedly told him, “I can do whatever I want,”\nand pushed him with both hands on the youth’s chest,\ntackled him to the concrete floor, and twisted his arm\nand leg behind his back. \n \t\n• K.Z. reported that in January 2007, after an argument\nwith staff, staff bumped into the youth but claimed\nthat the youth hit the staff.  Using this as cause to\nrestrain the youth, staff reportedly grabbed the\nyouth’s arm and foot, causing the youth to fall\nforward.  Once on the ground, staff pushed the youth’s\nhead to the floor.  Another youth corroborated this\nincident and stated that he heard the youth scream.\nThe following day, the Director reported this incident\nto law enforcement; two days later, a deputy responded\nto the facility to interview the youth involved.  We do \nnot know the results of the investigation. \n \t\n• D.B. reported that staff pushed him against a wall and\nput  his arm behind his back in a painful hammer lock\nallegedly because he was moving too slowly.  He \n\n-12-\nreported that staff then placed him on the floor and\nput their knees to his head and against his ribs.  He \nsuffered scratches on his leg and neck and swelling\naround his eye as a result of this incident.  Another \nyouth corroborated this story, stating that the alleged\nvictim told him he had been beaten up by staff.\nAlthough a mental health professional completed a\nSuspected Child Abuse Report (“SCAR”) about the alleged\nincident, the incident was not reported to DCFS or law\nenforcement at that time.  The Camp Director filed a\nreport with law enforcement four days later, on January\n21, 2007, but law enforcement had yet to respond at the\ntime of our initial tour. \n \t\n• Another youth, whose arm was in a sling as a result of\na fractured clavicle, reported that, in December 2006,\ntwo staff who had been escorting him had taken him\nforcefully to the ground.9  He further reported that one\nof the officers drove his knee into the youth’s\nshoulder and pulled the youth’s arm up behind his back,\ncausing considerable pain and aggravating the fracture.\nThe youth reported that the officers then lifted him to\nhis feet and slammed him into the wall twice.  He \ncomplained about excessive pain to his injured arm but\nreported that medical staff did not see him until the\nfollowing day.  He reported the incident\nto his case manager, who had him complete an affidavit.\nA police report was filed, but staff from the SIU\ninterviewed the youth.  We do not know the results of \nthe SIU’s investigation.10 \nAdditionally, youth reported that Holton staff order youth\nto go to the Command Center (“CC”) and assume the “bob sled\nposition” (meaning that youth are made to sit on the ground with\ntheir knees close to their chests and their arms interlocked \naround their knees).  Youth reported that by “assuming the bob\nsled position” in the CC, “no one can see what is happening to\nyou.”  One youth reported that staff also turn the lights off and\nkick the youth when they are forced to assume the bob sled\nposition.  The youth reported that this practice occurs as often \n9  We believe that the youth’s clavicle was broken prior\nto the incident, but we cannot confirm or deny this belief\nbecause we were denied access to the youth’s medical files. \n10  As discussed later in the report, the County refused to\nprovide us with any of their child abuse investigations. \n\n-13-\nas two to three times per week.  S.C. reported that he had been\nforced to assume the bob sled position twice.  P.S. reported that\nyouth sit in the bob sled position out of camera range where\n“staff can slap and yell at you.” \niii. Camp Scott \nYouth at Camp Scott repeatedly reported that staff twist\nyouth’s arms behind their backs to control their behavior, and\none staff person in particular was mentioned repeatedly as using\ninappropriate force by tackling youth, twisting their arms behind\ntheir backs, and slamming them to the ground. \nStaff at Camp Scott also lack of knowledge of both the\nproper thresholds for reporting allegations of abuse and the\nauthorities to whom to report such allegations.  These \ninadequacies are clearly evident in the way in which recent\nallegations of staff abuse have been handled.  Although\nsupervisors and administrators took some action in most of the\nsituations described later in this letter, their actions stopped\nfar short of a formal report to the proper authority, and fell\nsubstantially below generally accepted professional standards. \n \t\niv. Camp Kilpatrick \nWe are very pleased to report that we did not uncover any\nreports of staff abuse at Camp Kilpatrick.  Although staff\ntraining on the use of force is inadequate at all of the Camps,\nincluding Kilpatrick (as discussed below), youth interviews and\ndocuments consistently indicated that staff at Camp Kilpatrick\nexercise a continuum of non-physical interventions prior to using\nphysical force.  Moreover, although proper medical documentation\nwas not available for review, the documents we did review\nindicated that staff intervention in altercations did not cause \nor exacerbate injuries to youth.  Youth at Camp Kilpatrick also\nconsistently reported that they could talk to staff about their\nproblems or concerns without fear of retaliation. \n \n \t\nb. Excessive and Inappropriate Use of OC Spray\nat Challenger  \nProbation officers throughout the Challenger Camps are using\nOC spray excessively.  See Alexander S. v. Boyd, 876 F. Supp. at\n786 (finding that the use of CS gas (a form of tear gas) in a\njuvenile justice facility for purposes other than the protection\nof staff or other juveniles, or where there is a threat of\nserious bodily harm, is unconstitutional).  Probation Department\npolicy on the use of chemical agents in the Camps appropriately \n\n-14-\nrequires that such agents be used only as a last resort.  The \npolicy requires that staff follow a use of force continuum and\nattempt to de-escalate a situation before deploying OC spray.\nThe Probation Department fails to comply with this policy. \nFor example, N.T. reported that a probation officer at Camp\nMcNair (one of the Challenger Camps) slams youth into a prone\nposition on the ground, sprays them with OC spray, and then kicks\nthem.  A number of youth similarly reported excessive uses of OC\nspray at Camp Smith.  L.O. allegedly observed a youth sprayed\nwith OC while the youth was restrained on the ground.  C.R. \nreportedly observed a youth sprayed in the face for no apparent\nreason as he entered the dorm.  At Camp Resnick, J.I. alleged\nthat he observed a probation officer empty a can of OC spray on\ntwo youth who had been fighting but had complied with his order\nto get on the ground.  As previously mentioned, A.K. alleged that\nprobation officers punched, kicked, and sprayed a handcuffed\njuvenile at Camp Resnick. \nFurther, a probation officer told us about an incident in\nwhich OC spray was used in the SHU in April 2006.  Allegedly,\nseveral Camp McNair youth were sent to the SHU after a\ndisturbance.  Many of the youth were yelling and banging on their\ncell doors for hours.  Another supervisor identified a couple of\nyouth who were banging especially hard.  That supervisor and an\nofficer moved to one of the cells and opened the door.  They gave\na verbal OC warning.  The youth jumped back in what the officers\nperceived to be a threatening manner.  A probation officer then\nsprayed the youth and quickly closed and locked the door to the\nyouth’s cell.  The probation officer and the supervisor then\nmoved to two other cells, where they sprayed one of the two youth\ninside. \nProbation Department policy also appropriately prohibits the\nuse of OC spray on youth who suffer from medical or respiratory\nconditions such as asthma, youth who are on psychotropic\nmedication, obese youth, and youth with mental health disorders. \n   As a mental health director reported, nearly half the youth\nat the Challenger Camps are being actively seen by mental health\nstaff, and roughly one-third are on at least one psychotropic\nmedication.  We were repeatedly told during our tours that youth\nwith mental health needs, and particularly troubled youth, are\nsent to one of the Challenger Camps.  Yet, we were told that the\nChallenger Camps are, paradoxically, the only camps at which\nstaff are authorized to carry OC spray.  One supervisor told us\nthat he believed that allowing staff to carry and use OC spray\nmade sense given the “mental health population” at the Challenger \n\n-15-\nCamps.  This rationale not only contradicts policy, but also\ngenerally accepted professional standards. \nIn addition to adequate policies, the County must also have\nclear procedures guiding the use of OC spray to ensure that youth\nwho have the disqualifying conditions listed above are not\nsprayed.  The probation officers with whom we spoke alleged that\nthey were not provided with this information.  Indeed, we\nreceived varying answers from staff regarding the types of youth\non whom it is impermissible to use OC spray.  When asked,\nprobation officers were unable to identify the conditions that\nshould prevent the use of OC spray, except for asthma or some\nother respiratory disorder.  Some staff could list a few youth\nwho had asthma, but most answered our inquiries about who could\nbe sprayed by saying, “I assume that all of them can.”  Further,\nofficers offered a variety of explanations as to precisely how\nthey would identify a youth as having one or more of the\ndisqualifying conditions.  Some officers stated that they simply\nhave no way of knowing whether a youth should not be sprayed,\nothers reported that youth with excluded conditions wear green\nt-shirts bearing the letters “MED,” while others told us that\ndifferent colored wrist bands were used to indicate the \nprohibited condition status of a youth. \nWe interviewed several youth who had been sprayed with OC in\nthe three months prior to our tour; several of them reportedly\nhad one of the disqualifying conditions listed above.  For \nexample: \n \t\n• W.G. reported having asthma.  Although he reported to\nus that he was not on any psychotropic medications, he\nreported earlier spending two months at the Dorothy\nKirby Center (the County’s psychiatric residential\ntreatment center), suggesting that he has a mental\nhealth diagnosis that would prohibit him from being\nsprayed. \n \t\n• G.R. was sprayed in mid-January 2007 and reported\nhaving been sprayed on at least one other occasion.  He \nreported taking psychotropic medications. \n \t\n• E.V. was sprayed in January 2007 after he and two other\nyouth were involved in a fight over a chair in the\ndorm.  He reported taking psychotropic medication. \nFailing to inform staff about which youth have disqualifying\nconditions for the use of OC spray is not only negligent, but \n\n-16-\nalso amounts to a gross deviation from generally accepted\nprofessional standards. \nFurther, no one at the Challenger Camps or in the leadership\nranks of the Probation Department has recognized that the use of\nOC spray at the Challenger Camps is a problem.  The \nSuperintendent at the Challenger Camps reported that she had\nheard of improper uses of OC spray in the past, but believed that\nthese had occurred “a long time ago.” \nFinally, the facilities do not have adequate procedures and\ndocumentation governing the issuance of OC spray canisters to\nofficers, nor do they have any procedures to weigh OC canisters\non a regular basis to detect the unauthorized discharge of spray.\nAfter our tour, the Probation Department  started to establish a\n“Use of Force Review” to assess the extent to which policies\nsurrounding the use of OC spray have been followed.  Although we\nhave not had an opportunity to assess the implementation and\nadequacy of this reform, it is evident that the use of force\nreview will not be meaningful until these policies are clearly\narticulated and staff have been adequately trained on them. \nc.  Inappropriate Staff Conduct at Camp Holton \nWe found the treatment of youth at Camp Holton by some of\nthe staff who work there particularly troubling.  We conducted a \nsecond, follow-up tour on March 7 and 8, 2007, to investigate\nnewly arising allegations of mistreatment and intimidation of\nyouth by Camp Holton staff, as well as reports that some staff\nmaintained and consumed alcohol on the facility premises during\nthe course of their 56-hour shifts.  The implications of these\nallegations were so troubling that we modified our previously\nestablished plans and revisited Camp Holton to interview youth,\nstaff, and Camp administrators, and to re-tour portions of the\nfacility. \nYouth reported on our follow-up tour that during our initial\nvisit in January 2007, staff allegedly warned them not to\n“embarrass” staff by reporting mistreatment.  We also learned of \nalleged remarks by staff during our second tour that were clearly\nintended to intimidate youth and prevent them from reporting\nstaff misbehavior to us.  A number of youth reported that one\nevening after we conducted interviews, staff purportedly made\ncomments like, “We’re going to have cheese sent up from the\nkitchen for the rats.”  Or, “C Dorm is still waiting for cheese\nfrom the kitchen.”  We heard numerous and serious allegations of\nstaff physically mistreating youth and intimidating them by\nthreatening physical harm or administrative sanctions if youth \n\n-17-\ncooperated with our investigation.  Youth repeatedly named three\nstaff and one former staff member as staff who threatened,\nintimidated, and put their hands on youth in a violent manner. \nAdditionally, on our second visit to Camp Holton, we\ndiscovered two bottles of alcoholic beverages in some of the\nstaff’s sleeping quarters.11  The use or possession of alcoholic\nbeverages by staff while on shift is expressly forbidden in\npolicy, and foments a serious and unnecessary risk of harm to\nyouth and staff in a secure institutionalized setting.  It is \nalso our understanding that Camp Holton leadership may allegedly\nhave been aware of allegations of mistreatment and alcohol\nconsumption by some of these staff. \nWe commend the County for taking immediate steps to address\nthe serious concerns raised as a result of this tour by ensuring\nthat the youth and staff who spoke with us were protected, and\nconducting an extensive follow up investigation.  We understand \nthat the County is also discussing this matter with the Probation\nOfficers’ union.  We do not know the current status of the \ninvestigation or the discussions, but believe that appropriate\ninitial measures had been taken when we raised our concerns at \nexit interviews. \n2.  Failure to Protect Youth from Harm by Other Youth \nThe high incidence of youth-on-youth assaults, particularly\nat the Challenger Camps and at Camp Scott, evidences another\nfailure of the County to keep youth safe.  At the Challenger\nCamps, youth reported that fights occur daily in the dorms.  A \nreview of the logbooks confirmed these reports.  Youth reported\nthat movement from the five camps to school - where groups of 90\nor more youth are escorted by approximately seven staff - was\nperhaps the most likely time for a fight to break out.  The \ncombination of large numbers of youth and relatively few staff\nwas cited by several youth as being a factor in fights occurring\nduring movement.  We learned that fights occur not only within\nthe staff’s field of supervision, but many occur out of staff’s\nline of sight, in places that could not be well supervised given\nthe small number of staff. \nYouth are aware of the severe shortage of staff and describe\ntwo primary “types” of fights - those that occur in the open and\nare seen and responded to by staff, and those that are conducted \n11  Staff who are in the sleeping quarters are still on\nduty. \n\n-18-\nin a more discreet fashion without staff becoming aware.  The \nmore discreet method of fighting is called “locking legs,” as\ndescribed above.  This form of fighting generally occurs in the\nback of the dorm room where large fans obscure the sound, and\nother youth obscure the vision of officers.  At Camp Scott, girls\nreported “locking legs” in the back of the dorm area and stated\nthat such fights occur daily.  Although youth reported that staff\nseldom noticed these fights, some youth believed that staff were\naware of the fights and allowed them to take place. \nAt Camp Scott, fights also typically occur undetected in the\nlaundry room and shower area.  For example, two youth fought\nundetected in the laundry room of the dorm.  Staff did not see \nthem until after the fight had ended, when a staff person noticed\nthat one of the girls appeared to be injured.  The girl required\nemergency medical treatment for a concussion sustained when the\nother girl repeatedly shoved her head against the wall.  Another \ngirl, H.N., alleged that she was repeatedly punched and stomped\nin the face and head in the laundry room.  A third girl had to\nintervene to stop the fight because staff were not around.  H.N. \nalleged that she had to be taken to the hospital as a result of\nher injuries and was purportedly told by a probation officer that\nif the officer gets into trouble due to the incident, “I’m filing\na ‘triple-seven’12 on both of you.”  In another incident of \nyouth-on-youth assault, two girls engaged in a premeditated fight\noutdoors, out of the view of staff.  Later, while the girls were\nworking on kitchen duty, kitchen staff noticed their injuries as\nthe girls washed their blood away in the sink. \nFights that occur in full view of staff are referred to as\n“going live.”13  Youth know that when they “go live” they will\nprobably be caught and punished.  Some youth alleged that staff\nhave encouraged youth occasionally to “go live.” \nFights are not the only evidence of the County’s failure to\nadequately protect youth from harm.  Many youth at the Challenger\nCamps also reported being “stressed” about other youth tampering \n12  A \"777\" refers to a formal probation violation filed\nwith the judge who retains jurisdiction in a youth’s case.  Such \nfilings can and, according to both staff and youth, often do,\nresult in additional time in custody for the subject youth. \n13  Many of the fights that occur at the Camps are\nconcealed, i.e., youth lock legs or fight in some other manner\nthat is undetected by staff.  “Going live” means that caution is\nabandoned and the fight occurs in plain view of staff and others. \n\n-19-\nwith their food, stealing their personal property, spitting on\ntheir beds, filling neoprene gloves with urine and throwing them,\nfilling soap cups in the shower with urine, as well as engaging\nin gang-related conflicts.  In several interviews, youth noted\nthat their stress levels interfered with their ability to sleep\nand that they had sought and received medication to aid them in\nthis area.  Several youth expressed fear that they would not be\nable to “make it” at the Challenger Camps. \nEach of these concerns from youth point, in part, to a need\nfor enhanced staff supervision.  Youth described the common \npractice of staff congregating for long periods in the command\ncenter area of the dorms, rather than circulating through the\ndorms as required.  Some staff believed that other staff,\nparticularly new staff, were afraid of the youth.  This fear of \nthe youth by some staff reportedly resulted in those staff either\nturning a blind eye to inappropriate activities or in a tendency\nto keep their distance from youth, typically remaining in the\nunits’ command center areas. \nIncreasing staff-to-youth ratios and ensuring that the youth\nremain under supervision at all times would likely reduce youth’s\nstress, decrease staff apprehension, and lessen youth-on-youth\nviolence at all of the Camps. \nAdditionally, the lack of an adequate behavior management\nsystem at the Camps contributes to youth-on-youth violence and\nthe staff’s inability to keep youth safe.  If staff had a range\nof options with youth rather than either, generally, the threat\nof a “triple-seven” or sending the youth to the SHU for an\ninfraction, and were provided with clear guidelines on the use of\npositive as well as negative incentives, the level of safety in\nthe Camps would increase. \n3.  Inadequate Staffing \nThe biggest factor preventing the Camps from keeping youth\nsafe is the lack of sufficient staff to adequately supervise\nyouth.  Without adequate numbers of trained staff, it is\nimpossible to respond in a safe and timely manner when violence\nand other crises occur.  Staff themselves discussed the stress \nthey experience when a violent altercation breaks out in their\ndorm, and they must choose between intervening in a fight or\nensuring that other youth do not become involved in it.\nMoreover, without adequate numbers of qualified staff, probation\nofficers do not have the time to build the relationships with \n\n-20-\nyouth that are necessary to identify potential conflicts, prevent\nincidents from occurring, and engage youth in meaningful\nrehabilitation. \nAdequate numbers of staff must be deployed to supervise\nyouth during waking and sleeping hours in order to protect youth\nfrom harm.  The number of staff available to supervise youth is\ndirectly relevant to nearly all of the measures designed to\nprotect youth from harm.  For example, each housing unit is\nstaffed with a combination of supervisory and line probation\nofficers.  Although seven staff may be assigned to a dorm holding\n100 youth, at any given time, only four of them are assigned\nprimary supervision duties, with two on one side of the dorm, and\ntwo on the other side of the dorm.  The requirement that they\nattend to the needs of so many youth prevents staff from being\nable to de-escalate tensions effectively.  This has serious \nrepercussions as some staff purportedly may not intervene in\nfights immediately, choosing instead to await the arrival of\nbackup staff, which creates the potential for youth to inflict\nmore serious injuries during physical altercations. \nBecause staff at the Camps work 56-hour shifts (16 hours on,\neight hours off, 16 hours on, eight hours off, and a final eight\nhours on shift before departing for four days off), they are\ngiven regular breaks throughout each of these stretches on duty.\nWe observed several meal periods during which only two staff were\npresent to supervise approximately 50 youth lining up, receiving\nfood, sitting down to eat, and cleaning up.  The other staff were \neither on break or doing casework (e.g., preparing court reports,\ncontacting the youth’s families, etc.).  When the youth were on\nthe housing unit, only two line staff were assigned to each side,\nresulting in a 1:27 ratio, at best.  All staff assigned to the\nunit are deployed to assist with movement to and from school,\nwhich may bring the ratio down to 1:15 if seven staff are\nassigned to the dorm.  When interviewed, however, staff indicated\nthat they are frequently required to operate with fewer than\nseven staff.14  In any event, a ratio of 1:15 during waking hours\nsubstantially departs from the generally accepted professional\nstandard, which is 1:8/10 during the day. \n14  The definition of “direct care staff” is inconsistent \nacross the Camps’ facility administrators and Probation\nDepartment policy.  The generally accepted practice is to count\nonly those staff whose primary duty is youth supervision, and to\nexclude those who are assigned as administrative, supervisory,\nand office staff. \n\n-21-\na.  Challenger Camps \nInadequate staffing during school hours at the Challenger\nCamps is a major concern.  The youth in each camp are distributed\nacross five classrooms allocated to that camp (youth from various\ncamps do not mix in the school setting, except in special\neducation classes).  During school hours, only one staff from\neach camp was assigned as the School Liaison, which translates to\na dangerous 1:110 ratio during the school day.  The School \nLiaison sits in “the bubble” (the equivalent of a control center\nat the school) and watches a monitor which, when functioning,\nprovides a three-second glimpse of each classroom in rotation.\nEach classroom has a telephone and a stationary panic button that\nthe teachers are to use when an incident begins.  Over the six \nmonths prior to our tour, the panic buttons were inoperable for\nlong stretches of time, resulting in one instance where a teacher\nwas unable to summon help when several students assaulted him in\nhis classroom.  Although other staff assigned to the dorm\nreportedly will respond when the School Liaison summons them on\nthe radio, those staff are often coming from far across campus\nand therefore are not immediately available to assist.  Teachers \nalso complained that the phone was often busy when they tried to\ncall the bubble to request assistance from the assigned officer.\nThe Superintendent at the Challenger Camps stated that the School\nLiaison is required to patrol the corridor outside the classrooms\nand to check in on each class periodically.  Neither teachers nor \nprobation officers reported that this occurs with any regularity. \nThe Probation Department’s Regional Director indicated that\nthe Challenger Camps had recently received additional staffing,\nsufficient to bring the waking hours ratio in all camps but\nJarvis up to generally accepted standards.  Although 62 new\npositions had been funded, 47 of these were vacant and the\nremainder were in pre-service training.  Thus, the enriched\nstaffing had yet to be put into place within the Camps during our\ntour.  In addition, the facility had 18 staff on worker’s\ncompensation leave, meaning that they were on leave after having\nbeen injured on the job.  Moreover, the filling of vacancies in\nthe recent past reportedly came, at least in part, at the expense\nof filled case worker positions.  According to the Regional\nDirector, 70% of case workers have returned to line staff\npositions, leaving significant vacancies in the case worker\nstaff. \nThe failure to meet generally accepted staffing levels at\nthe Challenger Camps results in significant and tangible harm to\nyouth.  As discussed earlier, physical altercations between youth\nare very common.  As detailed above, some of these fights \n\n-22-\noccurred within the staff’s field of supervision but many\noccurred out of the line of sight, in places that could not be\nwell supervised given the small number of staff. \nAt the Challenger Camps, directors and the Superintendent\nwere seldom observed circulating in the dorms or other common\nareas where youth could see them.  Youth commonly said that they\ndid not know who the Camp Directors were.  The lack of a \nhigh-level staff presence at the Challenger Camps seems\nparticularly unwise given the camps’ large number of new staff\nand generally challenging population. \nb.  Camp Holton \nCamp Holton also lacks sufficient staff to adequately\nprotect youth housed there.  Exacerbating the risk of harm\npresented to youth by chronic understaffing at Camp Holton is an\napparent lack of oversight and supervision.  As previously\nmentioned, youth repeatedly identified a specific group of staff\nas particularly abusive.  Also as noted, the leadership at Camp\nHolton allegedly was aware of some of the allegations concerning\nabuse, threats, intimidation, and alcohol, and we could not find\nevidence that adequate steps had been taken to address these\nserious allegations.  For example, during our January 2007 tour,\nwe expressed concern regarding the presence of alcohol at the\ncamp.  In response to this concern, the Camp Director reportedly\nissued a memorandum to all staff regarding the bringing of\ncontraband items into the camp.  Nonetheless, when we returned to\nCamp Holton in March 2007, we found alcohol on site. \nc.  Camp Scott \nWe also found inadequate staffing at Camp Scott.  A review \nof staff schedules revealed that overtime is used extensively,\nbut the lack of staff greatly affected facility operations.  In \nFebruary 2007, for example, the facility could not find\nadditional overtime staff to cover several shifts.  A review of \nthe supervisor’s log revealed that, on one night, staffing fell\ndangerously low, to only two staff from 10pm to 6am for\npopulations of 76 and 106 youth, respectively. \nInadequate staffing has led to staff being pulled from the\norientation/isolation unit (the Assessment Unit (“AU”)) at Camp\nScott.  A minimum of two staff is needed to keep this unit\noperational.  When the staffing complement is insufficient, the\nunit is closed.  A review of this unit’s Movement Log revealed\nthat the unit was closed on 10 of 63 days between January 1 and\nMarch 4, 2007, because of staff shortages.  Thus, the essential \n\n-23-\nfunctions of new resident orientation, small group counseling,\nand disciplinary isolation were not available on those days. \nMany youth corroborated that they either did not receive\norientation or were not sent to isolation as a result of the lack \nof staff.  In fact, during the several weeks prior to our visit,\nnew girls moved almost immediately into the dorms without\nreceiving the benefit of proper camp orientation.  One girl we\ninterviewed had been at Camp Scott for one week without having\nhad orientation and without having been assigned to a caseworker.\nAs a result of not having been assigned a case worker, she was at\na loss for how to access mental health services, gain access to\npersonal items that family members brought to the facility for\nher, file a grievance, access medical care, or become familiar\nwith the behavior management system.  She reported feeling\ndepressed and wanting to speak to someone from mental health, but\nshe did not know how to access mental health services, believing\nall girls were expected to make such requests through their\ncaseworker.  Camp staff and administrators informed us that the\nchronic staffing shortages have forced them to rely on youth who\nfill “leadership” positions to perform orientation and other\nduties more appropriately performed by staff. \nd.  Camp Kilpatrick \nCamp Kilpatrick also suffers from the lack of adequate\nstaff.  At the time of our visit, seven assigned staff were\nunable to report to work because of worker’s compensation leave,\nfamily leave, or sick leave.  Two other staff positions were\nvacant.  These nine slots accounted for about one-quarter of the\nfacility’s 38 line staff positions.  Although extra staff have\nbeen budgeted to ease some of this difficulty (i.e., staffing\nrelief factor), the significant number of staff who are unable to\nreport to work presents a significant burden for remaining staff. \nDuring our initial tour of Camp Kilpatrick, we entered a\nhousing unit at approximately 6:00 pm where only one staff person\nwas present, providing supervision from a position in the command\ncenter.  At the time, approximately 35 youth were involved in\nvarying activities the dorm.  Camp Kilpatrick’s staff-to-youth\nratios often fell below generally accepted standards.  The \ndisparity was particularly notable on the night shift, when a\nsingle staff member was commonly assigned to dorms housing as\nmany as 56 youth.  During our visit, the ratio was approximately\n1:45.  The generally accepted standard for staff-to-youth ratios\nat night is 1:16/20. \n\n-24-\n4.  Inadequate Staff Training \nNot only must the facilities have an adequate number of\nstaff, but these staff must also be well trained to manage youth\nbehavior appropriately, to de-escalate tensions and intervene\neffectively in crises, and to use force appropriately when less\nrestrictive means have failed.  The gross lack of staff training\nexacerbates all of the problems associated with the lack of\nstaffing at the Camps with respect to keeping youth safe.  The \ngross lack of training available to staff, coupled with the lack\nof adequate staff, means that staff are ill-equipped to ensure\nthat fights between youth are stopped quickly, appropriately, and\nsafely. \nThe County has no policy regarding staff training, when it\nis required, its content, or how staff skills and knowledge will\nbe assessed.  Staff at the Camps do not receive adequate training\nto perform critical job functions such as protecting youth from\nharm.  For example, staff at the Challenger Camps reported that\nthey do not receive sufficient guidance, either through formal\ntraining or on-the-job mentoring and supervision, on how to\nproperly restrain youth. \nThe lack of staff training is particularly problematic at\nthe Challenger Camps.  Given the characteristics of these camps’\npopulation as described by the facility Superintendent -- that\nis, youth who are on various forms of medication for mental\nhealth reasons, who have violent offense histories, who have\nmedical concerns, and who are generally considered to be “high\nrisk” -- staff training is essential to the safe operation of\nthese facilities.  This training is sorely lacking in all\ncritical areas, and was noted by many staff as being among the\ngreatest unmet needs at the Challenger Camps.  One supervisor\nnoted that this is particularly important given the large number\nof new staff at the facilities.  This supervisor noted that some\nstaff lacked basic knowledge about how to perform their jobs and\nconduct themselves in a safe and professional manner.\nSpecifically, the supervisor mentioned staff understanding of\nproper use of force techniques, as well as a wide range of\nunprofessional conduct, including staff use of foul language and\ntalking on cell phones while on duty, as priority training areas. \nTraining on the use of force should have, as its foundation,\na set of detailed policies governing the use of physical,\nmechanical, and chemical restraints.  The paucity of information\nin formal policy relevant to the use of force and the lack of a\nProbation Department-approved use of force curriculum illustrate\nthe lack of standardization and attention to this issue. \n\n-25-\nTraining documentation revealed that only 14% of Challenger staff\nhad received formal training in the use of force since January\n2006, while an additional 20% had received training at some point\nearlier in their careers.  At Holton, only 10% had received\ntraining in the use of force since January 2006, and 24%, at some\npoint earlier in their careers.  At Camp Kilpatrick, only 9%\npercent of staff had received formal training in the use of force\nsince January 2006, and only an additional 9% had such training\nat some point earlier in their careers.  Two-thirds of staff at \nboth Challenger (66%) and Camp Holton (67%), had never received \nformal training in the safe use of physical restraint measures;\nmore than three-quarters of Camp Kilpatrick staff (82%) had never\nhad formal training in such techniques.  Undoubtedly related to\nthis gross lack of training, as detailed above, youth uniformly\nreported the widespread use of slamming and other inappropriate\nuses of force by staff at virtually all the Camps. \nStaff interviews at all of the camps that we toured\nconfirmed that no Probation Department-approved use of force\ncontinuum exists, nor could staff name or demonstrate any\nspecific physical restraint techniques that were approved for\nuse.  Except for two individuals who were recently hired or\nrecently transferred to the Challenger Camps from one of the\nCounty’s Juvenile Halls, none of the staff had received any\ntraining in the use of force since their initial training after\nbeing hired.  For some staff, this meant that they had not\nreceived any use of force training in more than 10 years.\nSeveral staff indicated that they were not paid to attend\ntraining that was scheduled outside of their normal shifts, and\nthey therefore refused to attend. \nStaff’s lack of knowledge and the lack of a standardized\ncurriculum was highlighted in the incident reports we reviewed,\nnearly all of which lacked details about the specific ways in\nwhich staff intervened in fights between youth, what restraint\nwas used, and which staff participated in the restraint.  Most \nassisted \noften, the incident report indicated that the youth was “\nto the ground placed on the ground\n” or “ ,” but no details were\ngiven as to how this was accomplished.  (Emphasis added). \nIt is critical that training in the proper use of physical\nrestraint to break up a fight between youth be given to Camp\nstaff.  Youth and staff consistently reported a high number of\nyouth-on-youth assaults throughout the Camps.  Many youth\nreportedly sustained injuries during these fights (although the\nrate of injury could not be determined because the County denied\nus access to the youth’s medical charts despite our repeated\nrequests).  Youth and staff also reported a high number of staff \n\n-26-\ninjuries as a result of attempts to intervene in the fights.  The \nlack of training available to staff, coupled with the lack of\nadequate numbers of staff discussed previously, mean that staff\nare ill-equipped to ensure that fights between youth are stopped\nquickly, appropriately, and safely.  Of the 47 staff injured on\nthe job in 2006, nearly half (48%) were injured during the course\nof a restraint. \nFurther, our observations and reports from youth demonstrate\nthat staff are not properly trained to de-escalate conflict\nbetween youth.  Rather than using the typical methods of\nde-escalation (e.g., calm tone of voice, clear directions,\nproviding opportunities for youth to express themselves), some\nstaff reportedly instigate, antagonize, and otherwise encourage\nyouth to assault each other.  For instance, one youth reported\nthat in response to a brewing altercation between him and another\nyouth, the staff allegedly said, “Come on, you motherfuckers, I\nhaven’t seen anyone ‘go live’ in months.”  These, and other\nstatements like them reported by several youth, escalate, rather\nthan de-escalate, conflict.  Many youth described unprofessional\nbehavior by staff and offered graphic examples of improper uses\nof force.  Youth described staff provoking youth, ridiculing\nyouth in front of their peers, swearing at youth, calling them\nstupid, using sexual innuendos, fostering racial tension among\nyouth, punishing large numbers of youth for the behavior of one,\nand using excessive force.  Youth also stated that some staff \neven engaged in “gang talk” with them.  A youth from Camp Resnick\n(a Challenger Camp) indicated that a staff refused to let another\nyouth use the restroom after the youth stated that he felt ill.\nThe youth, in fact, vomited and the staff antagonized the youth\nby saying, “Stop acting like a bitch!  Suck it up!  Stop being a\npussy!”  The reporting youth filed a grievance regarding this\nincident and received a response two weeks later, stating that\nthe youth and staff had been “counseled.” \nStaff also are inadequately trained on procedures and safe\npractices regarding the use of OC spray.  The County’s OC Spray\npolicy fails to include a use of force continuum that would serve\nas a guide to its officers on when it is appropriate to use OC\nspray.  The policy also does not comment on the training and\ncertification requirements for staff.  We were also told that the \ntraining officers received upon hiring was inconsistent regarding\nthe proper use of OC spray, and that Challenger staff received a\nseparate training on the topic from a member of the Challenger\nstaff who also maintained all staff training records on this\ntopic.  We were unable to verify this because, according to the\nSuperintendent, the training records were lost.  Although we were\ninformed that efforts were underway to re-establish both OC spray \n\n-27-\ntraining and a record system to track the training, we were\nprovided with no documents reflecting the status of these\nefforts. \n5.  Inadequate Investigation of Abuse Allegations \na.  Failure to Report Abuse \nWhen an allegation of abuse is made, it must be reported to\nthe proper authorities to investigate the veracity of the\nallegation.  Generally accepted professional standards require\nthat all staff working at a juvenile justice facility be mandated\nchild abuse reporters.  As such, they must report all instances\nof alleged abuse, no matter how credible, to the state Child\nProtective Services agency.  The allegations or information must\nbe reported without filtering or making subjective decisions\nabout which are serious or credible enough to be reported.\nDisturbingly, most of the staff we interviewed at the Camps were\nunaware of their duties to report. \nAt all of the Camps, three separate agencies have been\ndesignated to handle allegations of abuse - the Department of\nChild and Family Services (“DCFS”), local law enforcement, and\nthe SIU.  Staff uniformly reported that they were responsible for\nreporting allegations they received to their supervisors, but had\nno knowledge of their responsibility to make an independent\nreport to any agency.  Indeed, none of the administrators or\nProbation Department officials knew what the staff’s obligations\nwere in this regard. \nAt Camp Holton, two of four abuse allegations that were\nreported to staff in the six months prior to our tour were not\npassed on to DCFS in a timely manner.  In November 2006, a youth\nmade an allegation of abuse to an officer and to a member of the\nmental health staff.  Neither of these individuals made a DCFS \nSuspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR), choosing instead to wait for\nthe Camp Director to return from vacation two weeks later to find\nout how to handle the allegation.  In January 2007, another youth\nreported an allegation to a member of the mental health staff,\nyet that staff person also failed to make a SCAR report.  The \nCamp Director made the report four days later.  The failure to \nmake a SCAR report is of great concern and severely threatens the\nintegrity of the process for protecting youth from harm by staff.\nIt does not appear that any of these staff were held accountable\nfor their failure to take required suspected child abuse\nreporting actions. \n\n-28-\nStaff at the Camps reported that they had not received any\ntraining on child abuse reporting in the previous year prior to\nour tour.  Training documentation revealed that only 16% of\nChallenger staff had received formal training in child abuse\nreporting since January 2006.  An additional 38% had received \nthis training at some point earlier in their career.  None of \nCamp Holton’s staff had received formal training in child abuse\nreporting since January 2006, but two-thirds (67%) had received\ntraining at some point earlier in their careers.  Only 4% of Camp\nScott staff had received formal training in child abuse\nprevention and reporting since January 2006; 49% had received\nsuch training at some point earlier in their careers. \nAlarmingly, nearly half (46%) of Challenger staff had never\nreceived formal training in child abuse reporting.  One-third \n(33%) of Camp Holton staff had never received formal training in\nchild abuse reporting, and nearly one-half of Camp Scott staff\n(47%) have never received any kind of training in child abuse\nreporting. \nAt Camp Scott, the lack of knowledge surrounding the proper\nthresholds and authorities for reporting allegations of abuse is\napparent in the way in which allegations of abuse have been\nhandled.  Although supervisors and administrators took some\naction in most situations, their actions stopped short of a\nformal report to the proper authority.  For example: \n \t\n• In November 2006, a youth provided a written statement\nrecounting an event that had allegedly occurred in\nAugust 2006:  “[staff] pushed me down on the control\ncenter and literally put his knee on top of my chest,\nholding my breath out/in, while his other hand was\naround my neck choking me for at least 5-10 seconds.  I \nblack [sic] out for about 2 seconds and woke up.”  The \nyouth stated that she told the Administrator on Duty\nwho replied that the staff was doing his job and that\nthe youth needed to calm herself down.  The Licensed \nClinical Social Worker (“LCSW”) receiving this\ncomplaint, completed a written report, and gave it to\nthe Camp Director.  The Camp Director, however, failed\nto report the allegation to the appropriate\nauthorities. \n \t\n• A youth alleged an inappropriate relationship between\nanother youth and a staff member at Camp Scott in\nJanuary 2006.  Although the youth’s statement named the\nstaff member, the facility never reported the alleged\ninappropriate relationship to DCFS.  The facility \n\n-29-\nadministrator reported to us that the SIU had\ninvestigated this matter, but stated that she did not\nhave a copy of the resulting report.  Of particular\nconcern, the same staff person involved in this\nincident was implicated in two other allegations of\nmisconduct in August and December 2005.  Even if the \nstaff member’s behavior had not amounted to “abuse,” it\ncertainly should have been evaluated for compliance\nwith the Probation Department’s policies surrounding\nappropriate professional boundaries. \n \t\n• In November 2006, a youth’s written statement clearly\nalleged excessive force and verbal abuse by a staff\nperson:  “[staff] grabbed my thumb and bent it back”\nand also called her a derogatory name.  This youth’s\nstatement was never reported to or investigated by any\nof the three agencies (DCFS, law enforcement, or SIU). \nCamp Scott’s failure to promptly report allegations of abuse\nto the proper authorities substantially departs from generally\naccepted practice and the Probation Department’s own regulations. \nAt Camp Kilpatrick, although there have been complaints of\nverbal abuse, there had been no allegations of physical abuse or\nmistreatment in the six months prior to our visit.  Nevertheless,\nit is of concern that staff reported they had not received any\ntraining in child abuse reporting, and some were not aware of\ntheir duties in this regard.  Training documentation revealed\nthat none of Camp Kilpatrick’s staff have received child abuse\ntraining since January 2006.  Approximately two-thirds (68%) had\nreceived training at some point earlier in their careers.  About \none-third (32%) had never received formal training in child abuse\nreporting. \n \t\nb. Failure to Take Adequate Investigatory\nActions Once Abuse is Reported \nOnce an allegation of abuse has been made, proper\ninvestigation is required to protect youth from staff abuse by\ncollecting evidence to verify or disprove the allegation.  These \ninvestigations are essential to identify staff in need of\ntraining and/or termination, as well as to clear staff who have\nbeen wrongfully accused.  The investigation process must have\nreasonable integrity, preserve all physical evidence (e.g.,\nvideotape footage, documentation and photographs of injuries,\nclothing, etc.), obtain statements from all youth and staff\ninvolved in the incident and those who witnessed the incident,\nand utilize other sources of information to corroborate or refute \n\n-30-\nthe allegation (e.g., logbooks, other sources of facility\ndocumentation). \n \t\n  i. Failure to document medical treatment \nfollowing a use of force \nThe integrity of the investigative process includes\ndocumenting the youth’s injuries.  Generally accepted\nprofessional standards require that youth subject to a use of\nforce be seen and treated, if necessary, by a medical\nprofessional.  Medical staff can also be an avenue for youth to\nreport abuse or mistreatment.  Further, even when youth do not\nreport abuse or mistreatment, under generally accepted\nprofessional standards, medical staff are mandated reporters of\nchild abuse if abuse is suspected.  Oftentimes, the nature of a\nyouth’s injury would lead a medical professional to suspect\nabuse. \nStaff and County officials repeatedly claimed that if\nmedical attention was received, it would be documented on the\nincident report.  The documentation provided by the County did\nnot suggest that medical attention is automatically provided to\nyouth involved in uses of force.  At Camp Holton, the medical\nportion of the incident reports we reviewed was left blank in\nnearly all instances; only two of the 30 incident reports\nincluded any documentation by a medical professional.  Thus, in\nthe event that the youth actually did receive treatment and the\nerror was one of documentation, we requested access to the\nmedical charts of the youth involved in the undocumented\nincidents.  This request was denied, and therefore no evidence\nwas provided that indicated youth receive medical treatment by\nlicensed medical staff following their involvement in a use of\nforce. \nAt Camp Scott, the available documentation also did not\nsubstantiate that medical attention was automatically given to\nyouth involved in uses of force.  Of the 27 incident reports\nreviewed, 18 recounted events that required some form of medical\nattention (e.g., fights, uses of force, suicide gestures, etc.).\nOf these 18, only five provided evidence to verify that the youth\ninvolved received prompt medical attention.  Several others \nprovided documentation for only one of the youth involved, and\nseveral revealed long delays in obtaining medical attention, even\nduring times when the nurse was at the facility.15  Six incident \n15  At some of the Camps, nurses are not on duty after\ncertain hours or on weekends. \n\n-31-\nreports did not include any documentation that the youth had been\nseen by a nurse following his involvement in the incident.  Once \nagain, we were unable to review the medical files to determine if\nthis was simply a failure of documentation or practice. \nEfforts should also be made to increase the involvement of \nmedical staff as an avenue to uncover information about youth\nmistreatment.  The nurses can conduct confidential interviews \nwith the youth to gather information about the incidents. \n\t\nii.  Failure to take adequate action\nfollowing an allegation of staff abuse \nYouth we interviewed reported several allegations of\nmistreatment at the hands of staff.  Pending the outcome of the\ninvestigation of these allegations, generally accepted\nprofessional standards require that these staff be placed in\nnon-contact positions.  Most of the staff we interviewed reported\nthat accused staff are “usually” moved to security, where they\nare deployed to the key room, office, or other positions where\nthey do not have contact with youth.  However, staff were also\naware of other accused staff who continued to work directly with\nyouth.  One staff reported that he, himself, had been accused of\nmistreating a youth, but was simply transferred to another unit,\nrather than to a non-contact position.  By moving accused staff\nto a position in which they do not have direct contact with\nyouth, the facility protects youth from the risk of harm and\nprotects itself from liability if the staff person were to commit\nadditional misconduct pending the outcome of the initial\ninvestigation. \nObviously, because some allegations are unfounded, it is\nvital that child abuse investigations be completed in a timely\nmanner so that wrongly accused staff can be can return to their\nnormal post.  All of the Challenger Camp staff with whom we spoke\nvoiced a concern regarding the length of time required for the\ninvestigation process to clear staff, if the allegation was not\nsubstantiated.  Reports of investigations pending for over a year\nwere not uncommon.  The length of time required for this process\ncontributes to the generally low morale reported by many staff,\nwho feel unsupported in doing their work. \nAt Camp Scott, the Director stated that accused staff are\nassigned to non-contact positions at Camp Headquarters pending\nthe outcome of the investigation.  However, as discussed above,\nseveral of the allegations of abuse occurring over the past 12\nmonths were administratively screened out and not reported to the\nproper authorities.  In one of the cases discussed above, the \n\n-32-\nsame individual was implicated in three separate incidents (all\nalleged misconduct).  None of the accused staff were removed from \ndirect supervision.  Failures to report allegations of abuse and\nto move staff into non-contact positions place youth at Camp\nScott at significant risk of harm. \nAccording to Camp Holton’s Director, staff at the camp are\nnot automatically placed in non-contact positions pending the\noutcome of an abuse investigation.  The reasons for this practice\nare not clear, although it is likely influenced by the impact on\nfacility staffing levels.  Indeed, a total of 11 staff were\ninvolved in child abuse allegations from November 2006 to the\ntime of our tours, representing approximately one-quarter of the\nfacility’s staff.  If all were to be placed on non-contact\nstatus, the facility would have a very difficult time covering\neach shift.  Although difficult operationally, the responsibility\nto protect youth from harm is paramount, and thus transfer to\nnon-contact status is essential.  The SCARs discussed above,\nalong with several other youth and one staff, made repeated\nreferences to a small core group of staff at Camp Holton who\nallegedly abuse and terrorize youth.  Indeed, these are the same\nstaff who the youth we spoke with described as being heavy-handed\nduring the course of restraint.  Camp Holton’s failure to place\nthese staff on non-contact status at the first allegation of\nabuse not only created an opportunity for additional allegations\nof abuse to occur, but also led to the sentiment among both staff\nand youth that staff are not held accountable for their behavior.\nThis lack of accountability leads directly to the culture of fear\nand intimidation that pervades youth’s experiences at Camp\nHolton. \nNormally, our site inspection protocol includes a careful\nreview of the investigations of each allegation of abuse\noccurring over the past 12 months.  However, we were denied\naccess to these documents.  The reason for the denial provided by\nthe County was the staff’s right to privacy.  This was despite\nour repeated offers to ensure confidentiality and privacy,\nincluding our offer to sign a confidentiality agreement.  Without \nthese documents, we are unable to verify that the County\nadequately protects youth from abuse by staff because we are\nunable to make any finding regarding the actual existence of such\ninvestigations or their quality.  Accordingly, we draw negative\ninferences and find that the investigations are inadequate. \nOur site inspection protocol also includes a review of all\ndisciplinary action taken against staff found to be guilty of\nmisconduct or abuse.  We were also denied access to these \nrecords, and therefore cannot verify that the County protects \n\n-33-\nyouth from abuse by appropriately disciplining staff.\nAccordingly, we draw a negative inference and find that\ndiscipline of staff who violate the rights of youth is\ninadequate. \n \t\nc. Failure to Provide Safe Avenues to Report Threats and\nIntimidation at Camp Holton \nAvenues for youth to report abuse at Camp Holton are\nineffective due to the culture of fear that pervades the facility\nand the failure to hold staff accountable for mistreating youth.\nAs previously mentioned, of great concern during both tours at\nCamp Holton were reports that youth were threatened and\nintimidated by staff in an effort to prevent youth from speaking\nwith us.  During the first tour, we had difficulty locating\nseveral youth who were supposed to have been confined at Camp\nHolton.  These youth, it turned out, had been recently\ntransferred to Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall (“Barry J.”).\nFacility staff were not able to tell us the time of return to\nCamp Holton so that they could be interviewed by members of our\nteam.  Our subsequent efforts to contact some of these youth at\nBarry J. were unsuccessful because, by the time we visited Barry\nJ., they had been transferred back to Camp Holton.  Additionally,\nas previously mentioned, during our second tour, youth reported\nthat staff made public announcements suggesting that the youth\nwho cooperated with our interviews were “rats.”  Other youth\nreported that staff warned youth “not to embarrass [them]” by\ntalking candidly with our team.  The various avenues for youth to\nreport mistreatment, no matter how well designed, are rendered\nineffective in a facility that permits staff to threaten and\nintimidate youth to prevent them from exercising their right to\ndiscuss their conditions of confinement with federal \ninvestigators. \n \t\n6. Inadequate Classification  System \nThe absence of an adequate classification system also\ncontributes to the County’s inability to keep youth safe.\nGenerally accepted professional standards require that youth be\nhoused and supervised based on a reliable classification system\nwhich includes the following considerations:  a youth’s age,\ncharged offense, history of violence and escape, gang membership\nor affiliation, health and mental health concerns, and\ninstitutional history. \nThe youth at the Camps are, at best, classified in an ad hoc\nmanner, rendering it impossible to safely house youth.\nCompounding the problem of inadequate placement criteria is the \n\n-34-\nphysical structure of the housing units and lack of adequate\nnumbers of staff.  At the Challenger Camps, the facility\nSuperintendent indicated that initial camp placements are loosely\nbased on the programmatic focus at the camp.  However, we did not\nfind this to be the case.  The Challenger Camps do not utilize a\nstructured decision-making tool to make housing decisions within\neach camp.  Instead, they rely on the subjective assessments of\nstaff, none of whom have received classification training.  Youth \nwho are considered to be “at risk” are reportedly assigned bunks\nin the front of each dorm.  However, staff were not consistent in\ntheir definition of “at risk.”  Most often, youth were judged to\nbe at risk due to a particular medical condition.  None of the \nstaff included youth who were vulnerable (due to age, size,\netc.), had serious mental health issues, or who were at risk of\nself-harming behavior.  Occasionally, staff discussed the need to\nseparate members of rival gangs, but there was no method for\ndoing so. \nSimilar to the practice at the Challenger Camps, at Camp\nHolton, youth who are considered “at risk” are reportedly\nassigned bunks close to the command center.  However, this\npractice appeared to be applied with questionable consistency.\nAt Camp Holton, our findings rest almost exclusively on reports\nfrom staff and administrators.  We were unable to verify whether,\nin fact, at risk youth are placed in beds closer to the command\ncenter because they did not maintain adequate records of bed\nassignments.  We requested the bed charts for one of the dorms\nfor 20 randomly selected days, but staff were able to produce\nonly four of them.  Not only are these records important to\ndetermine whether any classification system has been properly\nimplemented, but they are essential when investigating serious\nincidents or child abuse allegations that occur in the dorm. \nAt Camp Kilpatrick, youth are separated into two dorms, with\none dorm reserved for those participating in the sports program\nand the other dorm housing everyone else.  Youth considered by\nstaff to be “at risk” are assigned bunks closest to the control\ncenter within each dorm.  But we found no definition of the term \n“at risk,” and staff are left to interpret its meaning.  Youth \nwho misbehave as well as vulnerable youth and youth with medical\nconditions are all considered at risk at Camp Kilpatrick.\nAlthough an at-risk determination certainly is appropriate for\neach of these groups, not separating violent and non-violent\nyouth is contrary to generally accepted practice. \nThe primary form of classification at Camp Scott is to place\nyouth into one of four platoons:  one for dorm leadership, one\nfor youth with jobs, one for recently admitted youth, and one for \n\n-35-\ngeneral population.  These distinctions bear little relationship\nto protecting youth from harm or improving outcomes for youth in\nthe facility, which are the intended purposes of classification.\nThe platoon assignments do not account for a youth’s particular\nvulnerabilities, interpersonal conflicts, or past involvement in\ninstitutional misconduct.  Similarly, the concentration of those\nholding leadership positions into a single platoon limits the\nability of these youth to serve effectively as role models for\nother youth, which was noted by staff and administrators as being\na primary role of leadership. \nOne of the problems plaguing Camp Scott on an episodic basis\nis the involvement of youth in consensual sexual activity.  A \nreview of relevant incident reports indicate that, although staff\nattempt to note and address the behavior from a variety of\nangles, the use of a formal classification strategy was not among\nthem.  Youth found to be involved in this type of behavior are\noften assigned to the bunks farthest from the control center, and\nhave opportunities to manipulate the environment to provide cover\nfor their activities.  The use of a structured classification \nsystem to guide housing decisions would accurately identify youth\ninvolved in these behaviors. \nThe current classification process in the Camps does not\nadequately address known risk factors for institutional\nmisconduct, and could lead to the proximal housing of youth who\nshould be separated in order to adequately protect them from\nharm.  The Regional Director for the Camps reports that each of\nthe Camps will have an entirely different focus as a result of\nCamp Redesign, an ongoing 14-point project aimed at a variety of\nimprovements throughout the Camps.16  In the meantime, however,\nthe Camps’ method of classification does not ensure that youth\nare protected from harm, and substantially departs from generally\naccepted professional standards. \n7.  Inadequate Grievance Process \nYouth at the Camps are not provided with adequate access to\na grievance system designed to address their complaints regarding\ntheir treatment at the facilities.  Generally accepted\nprofessional standards mandate that youth should have readily\navailable access to a grievance process.  Where courts have \nconsidered this, they have uniformly found that detained youth\nhave a constitutional right to file grievances with facility \n16  The project is protected to continue at least through\nthe end of 2008, if not far beyond. \n\n-36-\nadministrators regarding their treatment.  Bradley v. Hall, 64\nF.3d 1276, 1279 (9th Cir. 1995); D.B. v. Tewksbury, 545 F. Supp.\n896, 905 (D. Or. 1982); Morales v. Turman, 364 F. Supp. 166, 175\n(E.D. Tex. 1973).  An objective grievance system should be well\nknown and easily accessible.  Grievances also provide an\nimportant quality-control mechanism by which camp administrators\ncan monitor whether facility staff are adhering to policies and\nprocedures. \nYouth at the Challenger Camps knew of the existence of a\ngrievance process, but very few had pursued it as a remedy for\nconcerns or complaints.  Most youth interviewed had no confidence\nin the grievance process as a useful avenue for addressing\nconcerns about staff or camp conditions.  Of the relatively few\nyouth who had raised issues regarding staff directly with\nsupervisors or via the grievance process, it was reported that\nsuch actions resulted in staff calling them “snitches.”  During\nthe tours of all the facilities, we noticed grievance forms and\nboxes in the housing units.  Staff reported that the boxes had\nbeen installed just prior to our visit.  The procedure previously\nhad inappropriately required youth to submit their completed\ngrievance forms to a staff member.  The availability of the\nsubmission boxes appropriately increases the confidentiality\nafforded to youth. \nAlthough they did not have great confidence in the grievance\nsystem, youth did use it to address some of their concerns about\ntheir treatment at the Challenger Camps.  We reviewed \napproximately 75 grievances from all five Challenger Camps\nbetween January 2006 and January 2007.  Approximately 20 of the\ngrievances complained about food, maintenance issues, and\npersonal products.  Approximately 25 grievances complained about\nthe denial of medical care or tensions between staff and youth.\nApproximately 15 grievances alleged verbal abuse or mistreatment\nby staff.  For example, a youth from Camp Resnick alleged that a\nstaff had cursed at the youth repeatedly and made fun of him for\nbeing gay.  This grievance was never responded to or resolved.  A \nlarge number of other grievances alleged mistreatment by this\nsame staff person. \nApproximately six of the grievances alleged physical abuse\nor the excessive use of force by staff.  For example: \n \t\n• In June 2006, a youth from Camp McNair alleged that a\nstaff used OC spray on him without cause, stating that\nhe (the youth) had assumed the “OC position” to\nindicate he was not involved in the incident.  The \n\n-37-\nresponse to the grievance was only:  “I will speak to\n[the staff] about the incident.” \n \t\n• In January 2006, a youth from Camp Resnick alleged that\nhe was physically restrained by a staff for five or 10\nminutes after an incident occurred.  The disposition on\nthe grievance form inappropriately concluded that the\ngrievance was “resolved” because the youth was\ntransferred to another camp.  It does not appear that\nthe youth requested the transfer. \n \t\n• In June 2006, another Camp Resnick youth alleged that\nhe was threatened by a staff who later grabbed the\nyouth by the neck and pushed his face into the ground.\nAgain, the grievance was “resolved” when the youth was\ntransferred to another camp. \n \t\n• In June 2006, a youth from Camp Scobee alleged that a\nteacher kicked him.  There was no response or apparent\nresolution of the grievance. \nAlthough a few of the grievances pertaining to maintenance,\nhygiene, and access to medical care appear to have been\nappropriately resolved, in many situations, releasing the youth\nto the community or transferring him to another camp led to the\ndetermination that an issue had been “resolve[d].”  All of these \ncomplaints were about conditions at the facilities that would not\nchange in any meaningful way simply because the youth was no\nlonger there.  Although the youth made the effort to address the\nissue, the staff responsible for resolving the matter chose not\nto do so.  Further, many of the grievances took an inordinate\namount of time to resolve, and many others did not have a date of\nreceipt or date of resolution written on them, making their\ncompliance with required timelines impossible to ascertain.  One \nyouth marked his grievance “urgent” and went on to explain his\ndesire to be placed in protective custody.  After 16 days, the\ngrievance was considered “resolved” because the youth had been\ntransferred to another camp. \nThus, although a grievance system exists at the Challenger\nCamps, it lacks many of the components needed for it to be a\nviable avenue for youth to state their concerns.  For the \ngrievance system to meet generally accepted standards, the\ntimeliness and thoroughness of the responses must be improved and\nthose indicating mistreatment or abuse by staff must follow the\nrequired procedures for child abuse reporting.  Finally, whether\nor not the youth is transferred to another camp or released to \n\n-38-\nthe community, the underlying issues for all grievances must be\nappropriately addressed. \nThe grievance system at Camps Holton and Scott is similarly\ninadequate.  At Camp Holton, only two grievances had been\nsubmitted between approximately July 2006 and January 2007.  One \nalleged abuse by staff and was properly reported to DCFS, but not\nbefore the receiving staff member replied:  “Denied.  If you\nfollowed instructions and did not resist, nothing would have\nhappened.”  The other protested a disciplinary write-up, and was\nresolved in the youth’s favor.  The system lacks a set of local\npolicies to identify responsible parties, timelines, and required\ninvestigatory procedures.  Further, contrary to policy, no\ngrievance log is maintained at either Camp Holton or Camp Scott. \nAt Camp Scott, a new staff had been appointed to serve as\nthe Grievance Coordinator.  In this new role, the Grievance\nCoordinator noted that he checks the grievance boxes daily and\ntries to respond to each grievance within 48 hours, and to\nresolve each within five working days.  These efforts to \nstrengthen the grievance process, however, have yet to take root.\nMost of the youth interviewed were familiar with the grievance\nprocess, but the process is used very rarely.  Although under\ndevelopment, the system as it currently exists lacks a clear set\nof policies to identify responsible parties, timelines, and\nrequired investigatory procedures.  The absence of a consistent \nand fully developed orientation program, during which new youth\nshould be adequately informed of the grievance process, may also\ncontribute to the limited usage of the grievance system.  Some of \nthe girls interviewed acknowledged using the grievance system, or\nat least considering it as one means of formally expressing a\ncomplaint.  Others expressed a total lack of confidence in the\nsystem, stating that they had complained previously about broken\nwindows and clogged air vents in the dorm, to no avail. \nB.  Inadequate Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Care \nThe Constitution requires that confined juveniles receive\nadequate medical treatment, including adequate mental health\ntreatment and suicide prevention measures.  See Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 323-24 & n.30; Oregon Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d\n1101, 1120 (9th Cir. 2003); Gibson v. County of Washoe, 290 F.3d\n1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002); Carnell v. Grimm, 74 F.3d 977, 978-79\n(9th Cir. 1996); Cabrales v. County of Los Angeles, 864 F.2d 1454\n(9th Cir. 1988) vacated and remanded, 490 U.S. 1087 (1989),\nreinstated, 886 F.2d 235 (9th Cir. 1989); Horn v. Madison County\nFiscal Court, 22 F.3d 653, 660 (6th Cir. 1994); Gordon v. Kidd,\n971 F.2d 1087, 1094 (4th Cir. 1992).  The Camps fail to meet \n\n-39-\nthese constitutionally minimal standards.  Below, we describe\ndeficiencies in the areas of suicide and self-harm prevention;\nmental health screening and identification; clinical assessment,\ntreatment planning, and case management; medication management\npractices; mental health counseling and other rehabilitative\nservices; and quality assurance programs. \n  \n1.  Inadequate Suicide Prevention Plan \nJuvenile institutions are required to adequately protect\nyouth from self harm.  Generally accepted professional standards\nrequire juvenile facilities to have a well-established suicide\nprevention plan.  The plan should be implemented on a systematic\nbasis and all staff members should understand it.  The plan\nshould include procedures for the placement of youth under\nvarying levels of enhanced supervision, immediate evaluation by a\nmental health professional, and, if necessary, safe transfer to a\npsychiatric facility better capable of handling a psychiatric\nemergency.  Staff members must be well trained on an ongoing\nbasis in identifying and preventing youth suicides, and the\nfacility should have a system for providing ongoing follow up to\nyouth who have expressed suicidal ideations while in detention.\nThe Camps fail to protect youth from self harm in the following\nways:  (i) staff fail to adequately assess youth for risk of\nsuicide; (ii) the Camps fail to provide sufficient mental health\nservices to youth on suicide precautions; (iii) staff fail to\nsupervise youth on suicide precautions and in seclusion\nsufficiently; and (iv) staff lack preparation and training to\nrespond appropriately to suicide attempts. \nAs an initial matter, it is critical to note that Camps\nKilpatrick, Scott, and Holton have absolutely no formal suicide\nprevention plan in place.  And the Challenger Camps’ policies,\npractices, and training regarding suicide prevention are grossly\ninadequate.  These deficiencies at all of the Camps place youth\nat grave risk of harm. \na.  Insufficient Suicide Risk Assessment \nA formal screening for suicide risk is necessary for all\nyouth upon entry to the Camps.  This screening should be\nconducted using a validated suicide risk assessment instrument.\nContrary to these generally accepted practices, the Camps fail to\nadequately assess youth’s risk for suicide upon admission,\nthereby exposing youth to grave risk of harm. \nNot one of the Camps has procedures in place to screen youth\nfor suicide risk upon admission.  Nor does any Camp actually \n\n-40-\nprovide such screening.  Instead, staff and administrators\nreported that youth are screened at the Juvenile Halls, prior to\ntheir arrival at the Camps.  The lack of screening upon entry to\nthe Camps is troubling for a variety of reasons.  First, the\nscreening at Juvenile Halls may take place months prior to a\nyouth’s arrival at one of the Camps.  A youth’s risk of self harm\ncould drastically change during that time, particularly in light\nof the stress and change the youth experiences as he or she\ntransitions from the Juvenile Halls to the Camps.  Second, a\nyouth’s mental health case file often does not accompany him/her\nfrom the Juvenile Halls, so relevant historical indicators and\neven suicide attempts may go unnoticed.  Finally, the screening\nconducted at the Juvenile Halls provides no protection for youth\ntransferred to the Camps from other facilities or from an\nextended stay elsewhere.   \n \t\nb. Insufficient Mental Health Services for Youth \non Suicide Precautions \nYouth on suicide precautions should receive appropriate\nfollow-up care from mental health staff to assess the need for\nongoing restrictions associated with such precautions and to\nprovide treatment.  In addition, a qualified mental health\nprofessional must be available for consultation during hours when\nstaff are not scheduled to be at the facility, and this\nprofessional should be able to respond promptly when a youth\nrequires crisis evaluation.  The Camps fail to provide sufficient\nmental health services to youth on suicide precautions, exposing\nyouth to grave risk of harm. \nWhen a youth is transported to a Special Housing Unit\n(“SHU”) on suicide precautions, the generally accepted practice\nis to place him on the highest level of supervision, one-to-one,\nuntil a qualified mental health professional can make an adequate\nrisk assessment and assign an appropriate level of supervision.\nContrary to this generally accepted practice, at the Challenger\nCamps, when youth are transported to the SHU, non-mental health\nprofessionals - individuals who are not trained in conducting\nsuch assessments - make the initial determinations of risk level \nand required level of supervision.  For example, we encountered\none youth whose level of supervision changed frequently,\napparently as a result of determinations of risk assessment by\nline staff.  Troublingly, this youth was never seen by mental\nhealth staff while in the SHU.  In general, the role of mental\nhealth professionals in addressing the risk of self harm among\nyouth was largely unknown to line staff. \n\n-41-\n  At the Challenger Camps, we encountered numerous instances\nwhere youth at obvious risk of self harm were not seen by mental\nhealth staff within a reasonable time.  For example: \n \t\n• One youth was referred to mental health on 11/30/06.\nHe was seen 11 days later, on 12/11/06.  The day after\nhe was seen, the youth made a self-harm gesture.\nContrary to stated policy and practice, the youth was\nnot transported to the SHU following this gesture.\nAnd, he was not seen by mental health staff for another\nthree days. \n \t\n• Another youth was referred to mental health on 9/23/06\nand again three days later.  He was not seen until \n10/9/06 – more than two weeks later.  Just over a month \nlater, the youth made a suicidal gesture and was placed\nin the SHU.  He was not seen by mental health staff at\nall while he was in the SHU.  And, he was not seen by\nseven \nmental health again until 12/27/06 - more than \nweeks after his self-harm gesture. \n \t\n• Another youth, who had a history of self-harming\nbehavior while in a Juvenile Hall, was referred to\nmental health at a Challenger Camp on 12/8/06.  He was \nnot seen by mental health until 12/28/06 –- a troubling\n20 days after his initial referral, and 22 hours after\nhe had engaged in another self-harming behavior at the\nChallenger Camp. \n\t\n•  Another youth was sent to the SHU at 9:30 a.m. on\n2/4/07, after he had cut his wrist during the night\nwith a piece of metal from his wristband.  Another \nyouth on the unit had alerted the nurse to this\nbehavior.  The troubled youth was sent to the SHU with\na notation indicating “recent cutting, verbalizes SI\n[suicidal ideation].”  The youth was not seen by a\nmental health or a medical professional until 7:30 a.m.\nthe following day - 22 hours after he had been sent to\nthe SHU. \n \t\n• In another incident, two youth who were brought to the\nSHU the previous evening on suicide precautions were\nnot seen the next morning.  When we asked mental health \nstaff why the youth had received no mental health care,\nthe psychiatrist stated “I forgot.” \nOnce placed on suicide precautions, youth at the Challenger\nCamps receive inconsistent follow-up care.  Despite a Probation \n\n-42-\nDepartment policy requiring that youth on suicide precautions be\nseen daily by mental health staff for the first five days, as\npreviously noted, youth often spend days in the SHU without the\nbenefit of regular clinical contact.  Moreover, none of the staff\nwith whom we spoke knew the requirements for monitoring youth\npending an assessment by a mental health professional.  Staff at \nthe Challenger Camps also do not help youth learn skills to\nreduce their suicidal ideations or behaviors. \nLike the Challenger Camps, Camps Kilpatrick, Holton, and\nScott fail to provide adequate mental health services to youth on\nsuicide precautions.  As noted above, none of these camps has a\nformal suicide prevention plan in place.  Instead, staff are\nsimply instructed to send youth either back to a Juvenile Hall,\nto a psychiatric hospital, and/or to the Challenger Camps if a\nchronic condition persists or a risk of self-harm develops.  In \nthe interim, however, not one of these camps has formal\nprocedures in place to protect youth from self-harm as they await\ntransfer to a more appropriate setting.  Procedures appear to be\nad-hoc in nature and not guided by formal policy and procedures. \nMoreover, although staff at Camps Holton, Kilpatrick, and\nScott stated that they would fill out a mental health assessment\nform if they felt a youth was particularly vulnerable, we found\nthe benefits of filling out such a form to be questionable at\nbest.  At Camp Holton, the time frame within which the form would\nbe received and a mental health professional would see the youth\nwas unknown.  At Camp Kilpatrick, as noted above, the\npsychologist is available only part-time and is assigned to at\nleast two other facilities; he therefore cannot be relied upon\nfor timely availability to youth.  And, although Scott appeared\nto have a good practice for referring, monitoring, and\ntransferring vulnerable youth so they could obtain mental health\nservices, the camp does not document this practice, so it could\nnot be verified. \n\t\nc.  Inadequate Supervision of Youth on Suicide\nPrecautions and in Seclusion \nGenerally accepted professional standards require adequate\nsupervision of youth on suicide precautions and in disciplinary\nseclusion.  Staff who conduct periodic checks of such youth\nshould document their observations and the times of their checks. \nSafety checks should be conducted at random intervals at least\nfour times per hour for lower risk youth, and more often for\nyouth at higher risk.  Per the Camps’ policy, a sheet is to be\ndisplayed on the door of each occupied cell with a notation of\nthe time the youth was last visibly observed, along with the \n\n-43-\ninitials of the staff member who conducted the observation.  In \naddition, prior to their admission to the unit, youth and the\nroom in which they will be placed should be searched to ensure\nthat no hazards or other materials that could be used in a self \nharm attempt are available. \nWe observed a number of disturbing practices regarding\nsupervision of youth on suicide precautions and in seclusion;\nthese practices expose youth to grave risk of harm.  Of \nparticular concern was the falsification of Observation Forms and\nlogs - critical papers that document the facility’s supervision\n(or lack thereof) of youth who have been placed in the SHU and\nmay be at risk of self harm.  Specifically, at the Challenger\nCamps, we observed that staff certified on forms that they had\nconducted checks at times that had not yet arrived (for example,\nnoting at 9:30 a.m. that a check had been done at 10:15 a.m.).\nWe observed a similar practice on at least one form at Camp\nScott.  Moreover, at both the Challenger Camps and at Camp\nHolton, we observed logs that had times pre-printed on them;\nstaff thus again were failing to record the actual times when\nsafety checks had occurred.  At the Challenger Camps, we also\nobserved staff filling in the logs by writing in observation\ntimes after we noticed that the log was blank or had not included\nan observation time within the last hour. \n \nBecause these forms are to be completed when an actual\nvisual check has been conducted, pre-completed forms suggest that\nstaff assigned to these high-risk youth are actually not\nmonitoring them in accordance with safe practices.  This \nfalsification of records calls into question the reliability of\nsupervision for youth on such special security status, and\nsuggests that supervision is insufficient to ensure that staff\nuphold these serious responsibilities.  Moreover, pre-printing of\nset times on forms does not allow for checks of youth at random\ntimes, as dictated by generally accepted professional standards. \nDespite questions about the validity of the Observation\nForms in light of the disturbing falsification we observed, we\nrequested random samplings of Observation Forms for youth in the\nSHU at the Challenger Camps, Camp Holton, and Camp Kilpatrick,\nand the Assessment Unit log for youth at Scott.  At the \nChallenger Camps, Camp Holton, and Camp Kilpatrick, only a\nhandful of the forms we requested could even be located.  Our \nreview of the forms revealed multiple additional failures to\nfollow generally accepted practices to protect youth on suicide\nprecautions or in disciplinary seclusion from self harm.\nDeficiencies included the following: \n\n-44-\n \t\n• Safety checks were not being conducted randomly at\nleast four times per hour (the Challenger Camps, Camp\nScott, Camps Kilpatrick). \n \t\n• Many of the forms revealed gaps of 30 minutes to\nseveral hours during which youth were not monitored at\nall (Camp Holton). \n \t\n• Forms contained no documentation of visits by medical\nor mental health staff (Camp Holton, Camp Kilpatrick).\nAt both camps, youth reported having seen the nurse,\nbut said they did not see mental health staff. \n \t\n• Instead of using individual forms for each youth,\nchecks were documented for the entire hall on a single\nsheet (Challenger Camps, Camp Scott). \n \t\n• Staff did not document the condition of the youth at\nthe time of observation (e.g., sleeping, crying,\neating, etc.) (Challenger Camps). \n \t\n• The forms did not evidence any supervisory review\n(Challenger Camps, Camp Scott). \n \t\n• The location (Dorm or Assessment Unit) was not marked\n(Camp Scott). \n \t\n• The length of time in confinement indicated in the\nObservation Logs did not match the time in confinement\nindicated in the movement log (Camp Holton). \nApart from the serious issues evidenced in our review of the\nObservation Forms and Assessment Unit logs, at the Challenger\nCamps, we observed multiple additional troubling instances where\nstaff failed to adequately supervise youth in the SHU, in direct\ncontravention to Probation Department policies.  For example,\nalthough Probation Department policy requires that the level of\nenhanced monitoring be gradually decreased over time as the\nyouth’s level of risk of self-harm decreases, we found three\nseparate instances where youth were returned from the SHU to the\ngeneral population without any gradual decrease in supervision.\nMoreover, direct care staff had placed one of these youth in a\nroom providing only supervision by camera upon his entry to the\nSHU, in direct contravention of the policy prohibiting the camera\nroom from substituting for direct care staff observation.\nAlthough the youth was later placed on one-to-one supervision\nafter a mental health assessment, one-to-one supervision should\nhave been the default level upon his placement in the SHU.  In \n\n-45-\nanother instance, a staff member providing one-to-one supervision\nto a youth did not have any information as to what behavior\nprompted the high level of supervision; the staff member reported\nbeing told only to make sure the youth’s hands were visible at\nall times.  Yet another staff member was performing one-to-one\nsupervision while he had a novel on the chair next to him.  It is \ninappropriate for staff to do anything other than observe a youth\nwho is placed on one-to-one supervision.  Such failures to \nsupervise youth in the SHU put already vulnerable youth at risk\nof grave harm. \nFinally, the Camps fail to adequately supervise youth at the\noutset of their placement in the SHU.  At the Challenger Camps,\nalthough youth’s general population clothes are shaken out and\nyouth are required to put on a SHU uniform, youth are not\nroutinely searched prior to placement in the SHU.  Similarly,\nyouth are not routinely searched prior to admission to Holton’s\nSHU.  A youth thus could conceal a weapon or other contraband on\nhis or her person and bring it to the SHU.  Indeed, at Camp\nScott, a youth gave herself a tattoo while confined to that\ncamp’s assessment unit.  This strongly suggests that search\nprocedures prior to her admission were inadequate.  Moreover, the\nChallenger Camps require a youth to search his own SHU room to\nensure that the youth is not unfairly accused of property damage\nin the room.  Staff - not youth - should be responsible for all\nsearches so that the Camps can ensure that youth do not have\naccess to contraband and potential self-harm items. \n\t\nd.  Lack of Preparedness for Suicide Attempts and\nOther Self Harm \nStaff training in suicide prevention measures at the Camps\nalso departs from generally accepted professional standards.\nBecause the risk for suicide may be present at admission or may\ndevelop during incarceration, it is critical at each juncture\nthat staff who interact with potentially suicidal youth be\ntrained to detect, assess, and if necessary, intervene to prevent\na suicide.  The generally accepted practice is for all staff to\nreceive suicide prevention training as part of both pre-service\nand annual training.  The Camps fail in this regard, exposing\nyouth to grave risk of harm.   \nThe Camps’ training statistics are alarming.  Half of all \nstaff at Camp Kilpatrick, and one-third or more of all staff at\nthe Challenger Camps, Camp Holton, and Camp Scott have never\nreceived formal training in suicide prevention.  Yet, these staff\nare responsible for the safety of vulnerable, potentially\nsuicidal youth on a daily basis. \n\n-46-\nAnnual suicide prevention training at the Camps is nearly\nnon-existent.  As of our visits in early 2007, since January\n2006, no staff at Camp Holton had received refresher suicide\nprevention training; only 5% had received it at Camp Kilpatrick;\njust 18% had received such training at the Challenger Camps; and\nonly 33% at Camp Scott.  Even when the training statistics are\nexpanded to encompass the entire course of a staff member’s\ncareer, the numbers continue to paint a dismal picture:  only an\nadditional 33% of Scott staff had ever received suicide \nprevention training, only an additional 45% had received it at\nCamp Kilpatrick and the Challenger Camps, and just an additional\n67% had received training at Camp Holton. \nBased on the training statistics, it is not surprising that\nstaff at all of the Camps lack knowledge and strategies for\nde-escalating youth who engage in self-harming behaviors.  For \nexample, at the Challenger Camps, even staff assigned to monitor\nyouth on the highest level of suicide precautions have no\nguidance as to how to respond to youth who make statements\nindicating they are considering self harm.  Indeed, Challenger\nstaff gave widely conflicting accounts as to the Camps’ policy\nand practice for safely managing youth who exhibit suicidal\nideations.  In one of the most egregious examples, one staff\nmember stated that OC spray should be used to stop a suicide\nattempt in progress. \nAdditionally, at all of the Camps, many staff were\nfrighteningly unaware of how to intervene appropriately in the\nevent of an actual suicide attempt.  For example, staff did not\nknow how to relieve pressure on the neck in the event of a\nhanging or how to use the cut-down tool.  In fact, at the\nChallenger Camps, although most staff were aware that cut-down\ntools had recently been placed in a lockbox in the control center\nof each dorm, none had received any training or instruction on\nhow to use the tool.  Indeed, when asked to open the box and\nremove the cut-down tool, the supervisor of the SHU was unable to\ndo so; his key did not appear to fit the lock.  At Camp Scott,\nstaff also had received no formal training in the proper use of\nthe cut-down tool. \nStaff at Camp Holton also were unaware of any formal\ncriteria used to determine the appropriate level of monitoring by\nstaff (e.g., 15-minute checks versus constant observation), or\neven of any formal procedures for notifying mental health staff\nor anyone else in the event a youth expressed suicidality.  Staff \nat Camp Scott likewise were unaware of procedures for monitoring\nyouth who had expressed intent to harm themselves.  In addition,\nat both Camp Scott and Camp Kilpatrick, staff lacked awareness of \n\n-47-\nthe ways in which depression manifests itself in adolescents\n(e.g., fighting, failing to follow instructions, or letting\nothers take advantage of them). \nFinally, we found that emergency intervention measures at\nthe Challenger Camps were wholly inadequate.  For example, first\naid kits and rescue tools (e.g., blades to cut ligature from\naround a hanging victim’s neck) were not available.  These \nfailures to have emergency equipment readily available to trained\nstaff can mean the difference between life and death to youth at\nthe Camps. \n2.  Inadequate Mental Health Care \nBecause youth who have the most serious mental health needs\nare sent to the Challenger Camps, those camps are largely the\nfocus of the mental health care deficiencies in this letter. \nNonetheless, it is important to note that none of the Camps\nprovides adequate mental health services to youth.  The Camps’\ndeficiencies include:  (1) inadequate mental health screening and\nidentification; (2) inadequate clinical assessment, treatment\nplanning, and case management; (3) inadequate medication\nmanagement practices; (4) inadequate mental health counseling and\nother rehabilitative services; and (5) inadequate quality\nassurance programs. \nAs an initial matter, many of the deficiencies described\nbelow are attributable to staffing shortages.  Specifically, the\nChallenger Camps have only one full-time psychiatrist, and a new\npart-time psychiatrist.  In addition, they have three full-time\nclinicians, two half-time clinicians and two interns (who are\npresent on Fridays and Saturdays), along with two primarily\nadministrative positions of Clinical Program Manager and Clinical\nSupervisor.  Having only five and a half full-time equivalent\nclinicians for a population of more than 400 youth with serious\nmental health needs is clearly inadequate. \nOf similar concern is the lack of adequate mental health\nstaffing at Camp Kilpatrick.  Camp Kilpatrick’s licensed\npsychologist - the camp’s only mental health professional -\nvaliantly divides his time between Camp Kilpatrick and at least\ntwo other facilities.  In doing so, he keeps no set schedule;\nrather, he sets his time at the facility based on staff referrals\nof youth to him.  Indeed, none of the youth on the psychologist’s\ncaseload were self-referred, and he is not notified about youth\nplaced in the Special Housing Unit in any systematic way.\nMoreover, he has not even been provided office space on site;\nconsequently, he is forced to carry his notes and files with him \n\n-48-\nat all times and is at the mercy of other staff and the\nfacility’s schedule when he needs to find suitable private spaces\nwhere he can meet with youth.  In the psychologist’s professional\nopinion, the youth at Camp Kilpatrick are not being served\nproperly with regard to mental health treatment.  At Camp\nKilpatrick (and at the Challenger Camps), interventions consist\nof “crisis management,” where the psychologist acts more like a\nsocial worker than a psychologist.  Camp Kilpatrick’s\npsychologist sees individual youth for approximately eight hours\nper week, a length of time he believes is insufficient to meet\ntheir needs.  He sees about 10 youth at the camp on a regular\nbasis, but stated that, because of staffing constraints, he is\nunable to provide ongoing psychotherapy.  He also is unable \nsystematically to contact family members of youth to engage\nfamily in support of treatment.  Although he has attempted to\nenlist the assistance of interns to expand mental health access\nat the camp, administrative obstacles have prevented him from\nbeing able to do so. \nThese staffing limitations inevitably affect the quality of\nmental health care and place these already vulnerable youth at\nsignificant risk of harm. \na.  Inadequate Intake Screening and Identification  \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that all\nyouth entering secure facilities receive a reliable, valid, and\nconfidential initial screening and assessment to identify\npsychiatric, medical, substance abuse, developmental, and\nlearning disorders, as well as suicide risks as discussed above.\nThe assessment should include assessment of suicide and homicide \nrisk factors and past behaviors.  Based on this screening and\nassessment, staff should refer youth for any required care.  To \ndo this, staff must gather available information, such as a\nyouth’s previous records from past admissions, and gather\nimportant information needed to care for and treat the youth.\nThe information must be communicated to appropriate personnel so\nthat each youth’s needs are appropriately and timely addressed. \nWe find the efforts to identify youth with mental health\ndisorders at the Challenger Camps significantly lacking.  Not \nonly do the Challenger Camps fail to screen youth for suicide\nrisk, as described above, but they also fail to screen youth for\nother mental health issues at intake and fail to review youth’s\nprevious records.  As with suicide risk screening, to the extent\nany mental health screening is performed, it is done only at the\ntime the youth is admitted to the Juvenile Halls.  Of additional \nconcern, there is no protocol to ensure that mental health charts \n\n-49-\nand information are transmitted from the Juvenile Halls to the \nChallenger Camps.  Thus, mental health screening information\ngenerated at the Juvenile Halls often does not follow a youth to\nthe Challenger Camps.  Consequently, the mental health team at\nthe Challenger Camps often has no way of knowing a youth’s mental\nhealth history and current medication needs or history.  If \ndocumentation does not follow the youth to the Challenger Camps,\nand a current mental health screening is not performed upon a\nyouth’s arrival, it is impossible to identify and appropriately\naddress a youth’s mental health needs. \nThe intake process at the Challenger Camps consists merely\nof noting in a youth’s medical chart those youth who come in on\npsychotropic medication and then scheduling a future appointment\nwith the psychiatrist.  Our observations, interviews with youth,\nand the facilities’ own documentation indicate that a significant\nnumber of youth who manifest mental health disorders are not\nbeing identified, and thus are not being treated.  These failures \nexpose youth to significant risk of harm. \nMoreover, the records provided to us reveal that the\nfacilities have no reliable documentation system in place to\nactually identify youth who are receiving mental health services.\nAt the time of our visit, the population roster listed 432 youth\nas living at the Challenger Camps.  The mental health services \nroster of youth currently on the mental health caseload, however,\nindicated that 433 youth - a number one greater than the\nthen-current population - were receiving mental health services.\nAs reported to us, this suggested that every youth at the\nChallenger Camps was on the mental health caseload.  When we \ncross-referenced the mental health services roster with the \npopulation roster, however, we discovered that only 192 names -\nfewer than half - matched.  Even more disturbing, the mental\nhealth staff for the Challenger Camps identified 86 youth who\nwere currently receiving psychotropic medications; of them, seven\nwere not on the population roster and another eight were not on\nthe mental health roster. \n \nBased upon these conflicting figures, it is readily apparent\nthat the Challenger Camps lack any uniform tracking system to\nidentify youth currently at the facilities, youth receiving\nmental health services, and youth on psychotropic medications.\nIf we rely upon the figures provided, it appears that only 46% of\nthe total population at all of the Challenger Camps is receiving\nmental health treatment (192 youth plus the additional seven\nyouth receiving psychotropic medications who are not on the\nmental health caseload).  This statistic suggests that the\nfacilities are not identifying and treating all the youth in need \n\n-50-\nof mental health services, particularly in light of the fact that\nall youth who have mental health needs are sent to the Challenger\nCamps and that, statistically, as many as 65-75% of youth in\njuvenile facilities have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder.17  \nThe failure of the Challenger Camps to adequately identify youth\nwho have significant mental health disorders is a substantial\ndeparture from generally accepted professional standards. \nIn short, the initial screening and assessment process fails\nto achieve all of its primary goals:  the process does not\nidentify youth who need immediate services, refer them for\nservices in a timely manner, screen out youth who should be\nhospitalized rather than admitted to the Camps, or gather and\ndisseminate necessary information to share with staff caring for\nthe youth. \n \t\nb. Inadequate Clinical Assessments, Treatment\nPlans, and Case Management \nGenerally accepted professional standards require timely\nspecialized clinical assessments of youth who have potential\nmental health needs, development of treatment plans to guide\nyouth’s care, and implementation of those plans.  The Challenger\nCamps fail to provide adequate clinical assessments, treatment\nplans, and case management. \n \t\ni. Inadequate Clinical Assessments \nYouth who are identified at intake as exhibiting behaviors\nassociated with mental illness and/or substance abuse disorders\nmust receive a timely assessment that includes the gathering of\nprior assessments, treatment history, and other information to\nconfirm a diagnosis and determine an effective course of\nintervention.  This process does not occur at the Challenger\nCamps, and the consequence for youth is haphazard, uncoordinated,\nand inadequate care. \nAs a result, some youth with serious immediate needs slip\nthrough the cracks and receive services far too late, or never,\nbecause of poor documentation and insufficient staffing levels. \n17  Los Angeles County Juvenile Justice Coordinating\nCouncil, Comprehensive Multi-Agency Juvenile Justice Plan, at 57\n(Mar. 20, 2001) (stating that both the National Mental Health\nAssociation and federal studies generally estimate that as many\nas 65-75% of incarcerated youth have a mental health disorder,\nand 20% have a severe disorder). \n\n-51-\nOther youth who are in need of an assessment are missed entirely\nbecause of the lack of screening.  And, as described more fully\nin the medication management section below, even where youth are\nreferred to mental health, they do not consistently receive an\nassessment. \n  Moreover, as a general practice at the facilities, it is our\nunderstanding that neither the psychiatrist nor any other member\nof the mental health staff reviews prior treatment records or\ncontacts community therapists, parents, or probation officers for\ncritical developmental and treatment histories.  This is not \nacceptable. \n   ii.  Inadequate Treatment Planning \nIn order for youth to receive adequate mental health\ntreatment, they must be provided adequate treatment plans that\nguide their care.  Treatment planning requires the identification\nof symptoms and behaviors that need intervention, and the\ndevelopment of strategies to address them.  Such planning is a\ncritical part of generally accepted professional standards and is\ncritical for effective treatment of serious mental illness,\nensuring that youth are receiving appropriate services, and\nallowing for the tracking of the youth’s progress. \nThe Challenger Camps lack any kind of formal treatment\nplanning.  Although recommendations for services are listed as\npart of initial assessments (to the extent such assessments occur\nat all), no treatment plans are identified.  Although case\nworkers write documents called “treatment plans,” these are, in\nreality, generally uniform sets of exercises designed to help\nyouth develop insights about their delinquent acts, their\nbehavior, and their future plans.  They are wholly unrelated to\nmental health treatment planning. \nMoreover, we found that, to the extent the Challenger Camps\nhave any unofficial treatment planning, that planning fails to\ntarget specific symptoms or articulate meaningful strategies;\ndoes not involve important contributors, such as family members,\nprevious therapists or psychiatrists, or any other system of care\nin which the youth may be treated; and fails to provide for\nmeasuring whether the plan is working.  The treatment planning\nalso rarely identifies co-occurring substance abuse disorders as\nprimary goals of treatment, even though effective treatment of\nmentally ill youth with substance abuse disorders must address\nthese issues simultaneously.  Particularly troubling, the\nChallenger Camps have no substance abuse treatment programming,\neven though staff estimate that 70% of youth at the facilities \n\n-52-\nmeet the criteria for a substance abuse disorder.  The lack of \nsuch a treatment program grossly departs from generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  In addition, the Challenger Camps have\nno system for establishing individual treatment plans or\nbehavioral plans for youth frequently placed in the Special\nHousing Unit. \nThe Challenger Camps also fail to adequately involve\nfamilies in any kind of treatment planning, despite the fact that\nfamilies are an extremely important source of clinical\ninformation and that it is not possible to conduct an adequate\noverall functional mental health assessment without including\ncurrent and historical information from families.  Challenger\nstaff reported that family meetings/therapy cannot be conducted\non a regular basis because no clinicians are available on\nSundays, which is the day families are permitted to visit.  The \nresulting lack of assessment of family, social, and developmental\nhistory and the lack of family involvement can handicap\nclinicians in creating appropriate treatment plans. \n \niii. Inadequate Case Management \nCase managers should communicate treatment plans for\nmentally ill youth to all staff involved in the management of\nyouth in a juvenile justice facility, and should coordinate\nimplementation of the plans.  Although all youth at the\nChallenger Camps are assigned case workers in their residential\nunits, these case workers have no mental health training, and\nserve as liaisons between the facilities and the probation\nofficer, rather than coordinating care at the facilities for\nmentally ill youth.  As described above, they write documents\ncalled “treatment plans,” but these documents have nothing to do\nwith mental health treatment. \nMoreover, staff who come in daily contact with youth must\nhave sufficient information about youth’s mental health symptoms\nso that they can understand and respond appropriately when youth\nmanifest such symptoms.  Communication between mental health \nstaff, health staff, custody staff, case managers, teachers,\ncommunity probation officers, and parents regarding the treatment\nof youth at the Challenger Camps is grossly inadequate.  Mental \nhealth staff do not share appropriate information with other\npersonnel who need this information to supervise youth safely and\nmeet their needs.  For example, custody staff do not receive\nguidance about the behaviors that mentally ill youth display that\nstem from their mental illnesses.  As a result, custody staff\nmisconstrue psychiatric symptoms as intentional behaviors, and\ninappropriately apply ineffective discipline in an attempt to \n\n-53-\nreduce the troubling behavior.  In addition, youth often target\nother youth who exhibit mental health problems, thereby\nexacerbating their symptoms. \nFurther, contrary to generally accepted professional\nstandards of care, the Challenger Camps do not provide aftercare\nplanning discharge summaries to facilitate treatment in future\nplacements.  Our review of 31 mental health records revealed that \nonly seven contained some level of aftercare planning, and none\nwere adequate.  Although staff reported that aftercare planning\nis an important part of a youth’s stay at the Challenger Camps\nand begins at the time of admission, we saw no evidence or\ndocumentation of such planning in the records we reviewed.  The \nfailure to communicate the goals, successes, and failures of\ntreatments tried at the Camps may compromise future attempts at\ntreatment for youth in other settings. \n\t\nc.  Inadequate Psychotropic Medication Management \nGenerally accepted professional standards include, where\nappropriate, the use of psychotropic medications to augment a\nmental health treatment plan.  The care of youth on psychotropic\nmedications requires proper assessment and management by a\npsychiatrist.  Medications prescribed should have a known benefit\nto treat the symptoms identified, based on a valid diagnosis and\nunderstanding of the root causes of the illness, and medication\nchanges should follow documented monitoring of the effects of\nprevious medication choices and reasons for abandoning a previous\napproach.  Youth and their parents or guardians should be\ninformed about the benefits and risks of medications and give\ninformed consent for their use.  Careful monitoring through\nlaboratory tests is necessary to ensure that youth do not\nexperience harmful side effects of many psychotropic medications. \nBased on our review, the Challenger Camps have serious\ndeficiencies in these areas, exposing youth to risk of grave\nharm.  First, we noted lengthy delays in the initial psychiatric\nreview of youth on psychotropic medications.  For example: \n \t\n• A youth arrived on 11/24/06 with a notation in his\nchart that he had been taking medications prior to his\narrival at the Challenger Camps, and an “ASAP” request\nfor a psychiatric evaluation.  No response was noted in\nhis chart.  Two more requests for a psychiatric\nevaluation followed on 12/7/06 and 12/18/06, both also\nmarked “ASAP,” and both had no response noted.  The \npsychiatrist did not see the youth until 12/29/06 -\nmore than a month after the youth arrived at the camp. \n\n-54-\n \t\n• Another youth arrived at a Challenger camp on 1/3/07,\nand a request for medication evaluation for him was\nsimilarly marked “ASAP.”  Again, no response was noted.\nShortly thereafter, the youth’s mental health services\nwere terminated as a result of his “asking for things\nand getting angry.”  Ironically, it appears that the\nyouth was denied mental health treatment because he was\nexhibiting possible signs of a mental health disorder. \n \nInstead of promptly evaluating youth who have been\nprescribed psychotropic medications prior to their admission, the\nmental health staff at the Challenger Camps automatically\ncontinue youth on those medications until they are seen by a\nfacility psychiatrist.  This means that rather than verifying the\nmedication and obtaining a verbal order from the camps’\npsychiatrist (thus sanctioning the use of the medication until\nthe youth can be seen for an in-person evaluation), medical staff\nassume that the youth is taking the medication pursuant to a\nvalid prescription, and that the medication is being prescribed\nfor the appropriate reasons.  This practice is particularly\ndangerous because, as discussed above, in many cases, the mental\nhealth records do not accompany the youth to the Challenger\nCamps.  We saw many cases where admitted youth had a history of\ntaking psychotropic medications, but had no records to document\ndiagnosis, side effects, or past efficacy of treatment efforts.\nThese youth nonetheless were continued on their medications.\nMoreover, as described above, we identified seven youth who were\nprescribed psychotropic medications but were not being seen by\nmental health staff because they did not appear on the mental\nhealth caseload. \nFor youth who did not enter the facilities already on\npsychotropic medications, the provision of such medications to\nyouth at the Challenger Camps who need them is inconsistent at\nbest.  Some youth are prescribed psychotropic medications without\nthe benefit of appropriate evaluations or systematic\nphysiological monitoring.  Other youth are not provided with\nmedications to treat their symptoms at all.  Still other youth\nare referred for psychiatric evaluation for “urgent” medication\nevaluations because of side effects from the medications or other \nmental health concerns and either are never seen by the\npsychiatrist or are seen weeks after the request for referral. \nMoreover, where youth are placed or continued on\npsychotropic medications, the Challenger Camps have no protocols\nfor providing monitoring or periodic reassessment.  Specifically,\nalthough many of the medications youth at the Challenger Camps\nare taking require laboratory tests prior to and during the \n\n-55-\ncourse of the treatment, we found no protocols for the\nadministration of appropriate tests to monitor the efficacy and\nside effects of psychotropic medications in accordance with\nprofessional medical standards.  Additionally, the frequency of\npsychiatric follow-up depends, in many cases, upon when the\npsychiatrist has time to evaluate the youth.  Often, such\nevaluation does not occur for months after the youth’s arrival.\nWe found a wide range of follow-up frequency, from several weeks\nto more than 60 days.  For example: \n \t\n• One youth’s chart contained an “ASAP” request for\nmedication evaluation dated 1/20/07, as well as a\nsecond request on 2/3/07.  Despite these repeated\nurgent requests, as of our tour on 3/7/07, the youth’s\nchart contained no documentation indicating that a\npsychiatric evaluation had occurred. \n \t\n• Another youth was referred from another camp on 9/26/06\nfor an “urgent” medication evaluation because he had\nbeen having “severe headaches” and was “very irritable”\nsince stopping his medications.  Although he denied\nsuicidal ideation, he made the statement, “I can’t make\nit.”  He was housed in the Special Housing Unit pending\na psychiatric evaluation, which he did not receive for\nmore than a week. \nIn addition, although the case files reviewed all included\nsigned consent forms for treatment, it does not appear that the\nChallenger Camps involve families in youth’s therapy and\ntreatment, including when the treatment includes psychotropic\nmedications.  Families should be involved, where possible. \nFinally, as discussed above, youth at the Challenger Camps\nare discharged from the facilities without aftercare planning,\nincluding medication or prescriptions, thus making it likely that\ntheir medications will be discontinued precipitously.  This can \nbe dangerous.  See, e.g., Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F.3d 1160,\n1164 (9th Cir. 1999) (in the context of a prisoner who was\nreceiving psychotropic medication while incarcerated, holding\nthat the State “must provide an outgoing prisoner who is\nreceiving and continues to require medication with a supply\nsufficient to ensure that he has that medication available during\nthe period of time reasonably necessary to permit him to consult\na doctor and obtain a new supply.”). \n\n-56-\n \t\nd. Inadequate Mental Health Counseling and Other\nRehabilitative Services \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that\nmental health counseling be provided frequently and consistently\nenough to provide meaningful interventions for youth.  Treatment \nshould utilize approaches that generally accepted practices have\ndetermined are effective.  Youth with mental illness should \nreceive treatment in settings appropriate to their needs. \nWe have noted previously the lack of adequate mental health\ncounseling and rehabilitative treatment at Camp Kilpatrick.  At \nthe Challenger Camps, mental health counseling is also inadequate\nto meet the needs of mentally ill youth both in frequency and in\ncontent.  The limited counseling records that exist do not\nevidence adequate use of effective treatment strategies.  Despite\nthe presence of some caring, dedicated counselors, interventions\nare not structured toward specific goals and do not adequately\ninvolve approaches accepted as effective.  As discussed above,\nmany youth are prescribed psychotropic medications to manage\ntheir behavior, but receive no counseling whatsoever.  Indeed, as\nnoted above, the youth with mental health needs are housed at the\nChallenger Camps; yet, as the Director of Mental Health Services\nat the Challenger Camps explained to us, mental health services\nat the Challenger Camps consist of “mostly crisis intervention.” \nTroublingly, the Challenger Camps fail to provide adequate\nindividual and group therapies.  Both types of therapy are\ncritical to effective treatment in detention settings and are\nrequired by generally accepted professional standards of\npractice. \nOf equal concern is the lack of a substance abuse treatment\nprogram.  Staff generally do not examine individual patterns of\nuse, abuse, addiction, or motivation, nor do they instruct youth\nin alternative stress management or abstinence support\ntechniques.  We found similar deficiencies in this area at Camp\nHolton, as well. \n  Recordkeeping also is inadequate.  Mental health staff must \nkeep records in a manner that allows both mental health and\nnon-mental health staff at the facility, as well as future\nproviders, to track treatment previously provided.  Records of \nprior interventions are critical to guide staff regarding\neffective methods of crisis intervention.  Counseling records at\nthe Challenger Camps are incomplete, as evidenced by the failure\nto document follow-up to mental health referrals, including those\ninvolving requests for treatment, medication side effects, \n\n-57-\ndiscontinuation of psychotropic medications, and suicidal\nthoughts. \nThe lack of family involvement in treatment is concerning.\nCounseling staff fail to adequately involve youth’s families in\ntherapy and treatment interventions, thus reducing the\neffectiveness of any attempt at rehabilitation for youth who plan\nto return to their families following detention. \nAdditionally, generally accepted professional standards\nrequire juvenile facilities to provide opportunities for\nrehabilitation that include effective behavior management\nsystems.  Effective behavior management systems generally involve\nincentive-based programs for promoting appropriate behaviors\nthroughout the day, and clearly defined guidelines that are\nconsistently applied across each institution.  For youth\nidentified as having behavioral health problems, behavior\nmanagement programs need to be coordinated with a treatment plan.\nAppropriate rehabilitative programs for youth confined in\njuvenile justice facilities include programs that address family\nconflict, substance abuse, anger management, gang affiliation,\nand other issues youth in a juvenile justice system typically\nface. \nContrary to these generally accepted professional standards,\nthe Challenger Camps do not have an adequate behavioral\nmanagement system in place.  As a result, the goals of custody\nstaff and mental health providers are not coordinated, and youth\ndo not benefit from the little mental health treatment that is \nprovided. \ne.  Inadequate Quality Assurance Program \nGenerally accepted professional standards require juvenile\nfacilities to establish a quality assurance program to\ncontinuously evaluate the processes and efficacy of mental health\ntreatment.  The Challenger Camps lack any such program.  Indeed,\nthey do not even conduct internal audits; at most, the Los\nAngeles County Department of Mental Health conducts yearly\naudits.  The risk of inadequate treatment without accountability\nor oversight is extremely high.  The lapses in care discussed\nabove should not have to be discovered by outside auditors or\nagencies.  And, they would be less likely to occur in the first\ninstance if adequate internal review processes were in place. \n\n-58-\nIII.  REMEDIAL MEASURES \nIn order to rectify the identified deficiencies and protect\nthe constitutional rights of the youth confined at the Camps,\nthe County should implement, at a minimum, the following\nmeasures:  \n\t\nA.  Protection of Youth From Harm \n\t\n1.  Ensure that youth are adequately protected from staff\nabuse and abusive institutional practices such as\n“slamming,” or “assuming the bob sled position.” \n \t\n2. Develop and implement a use of force policy that\nprovides clear guidelines and appropriate limits on\nthe use of force, including OC spray.  Ensure that OC \nspray is used only where there is an imminent risk of\nserious bodily harm and no other less intrusive\nrestraint is available, and that policies regarding\ndisqualifying conditions for use of OC spray are\ndeveloped and followed.  Ensure that all uses of OC \nspray or chemical restraints are well-documented and\nreviewed in a timely manner by senior administrators. \n \t\n3. Ensure that staff neither threaten or intimidate youth\nfrom reporting abuse or mistreatment, nor maintain or \nconsume alcohol at the Camps. \n\t\n4.  Ensure that the facilities maintain sufficient levels \nof adequately trained direct care staff to supervise\nyouth safely.  Provide sufficient staff supervision to\nkeep youth safe from youth-on-youth violence and allow\nrehabilitative activities to occur successfully in\naccordance with generally accepted professional\nstandards. \n\t\n5.  Improve orientation to communicate important\ninformation to new residents, such as how to access\nthe grievance system, medical care, and mental health\nservices. \n\t\n6.  Ensure that there is an adequate, appropriate, and\neffective behavior management system in place, and\nthat the system is regularly reviewed and modified in\naccordance with evidence-based principles. \n \t\n7. Provide adequate training and supervision to staff in\nall areas necessary for the safe and effective \n\n-59-\nperformance of job duties, including training in child\nabuse reporting and training in the safe and\nappropriate use of force and physical restraint, the\nuse of force continuum, and de-escalation techniques.\nRoutinely provide refresher training as required by\ngenerally accepted standards. \n\t\n8.  Ensure that all allegations of child abuse and\nmistreatment are promptly referred to the appropriate\nauthorities. \n \t\n9. Ensure that serious incidents, allegations of abuse,\nand allegations of staff misconduct are adequately and\ntimely investigated. \n\t\n10.  Ensure that the facilities provide adequate\nprotections for youth once abuse has been reported,\nand safe avenues through which youth may report\nmistreatment. \n\t\n11.  Ensure that the facilities develop and implement an\nadequate objective housing classification system to\nensure safe and appropriate housing assignments. \n \t\n12. Ensure that the facilities develop and maintain an\nadequate youth grievance system that ensures youth\naccess to a functional and responsive grievance\nprocess. \n \t\nB. Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Care \n \t\n1. Develop and implement an adequate formal suicide\nprevention policy, procedure, and protocol. \n\t\n2.  Develop policies and procedures to reduce the risk of\nself harm and suicidal behaviors, to include adequate\nsuicide risk assessments in accordance with generally\naccepted professional standards. \n \t\n3. Develop and adhere to specific protocols for mental\nhealth involvement for all youth identified as being\nat risk of suicide. \n \t\n4. Adequately and effectively monitor all youth who are\nplaced on suicide precautions in accordance with\ngenerally accepted professional standards in order to\nreduce the risk of self harm, and accurately document\nthe frequency of all safety checks.   \n\n-60-\n \t\n5. Create and implement a procedure for enacting suicide\nprecautions pending transfer to another facility for\nassessment.    \n \t\n6. Provide staff with adequate training to identify and\nsupervise youth at risk for suicide, including\ntraining on suicide prevention measures such as the\nproper use of cut down tools, and re-train staff\nannually to refresh their skills and knowledge of\nsuicide prevention procedures. \n\t\n7.  Provide and maintain adequate mental health care\nstaffing. \n\t\n8.  Provide an adequate, comprehensive, reliable mental\nhealth screening and assessment at intake. \n \t\n9. Develop and implement policies, practices, and\nprocedures for identifying youth receiving mental\nhealth services and youth on psychotropic medications. \n \t\n10. Maintain accurate and complete mental health records;\nensure that all relevant records are forwarded from \nthe Juvenile Halls in a timely manner.   \n \t\n11. Provide ongoing training, proper supervision, and\nreasonable accountability for mental health clinicians\nin accordance with generally accepted professional\nstandards. \n  \n\t\n12.  Provide timely evaluations to youth referred for\nmental health services. \n\t\n13.  Establish and maintain adequate formal treatment\nplanning in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards.    \n\t\n14.  Establish and maintain adequate mental health\nprogramming, including substance abuse programming,\nand the case management thereof.     \n\t\n15.  Establish and maintain protocols to monitor youth who\nare on psychotropic medications in accordance with\ngenerally accepted professional standards.    \n\t\n16.  Provide aftercare planning discharge summaries to\nfacilitate treatment in future placements. \n\n-61-\n \t\n17. Establish and maintain an effective quality assurance\nprogram consisting of established policies and\nprocedures by which to judge the quality and success\nof treatment.    \n* * * * * \nPlease note that this findings letter is a public document.\nIt will be posted on the Civil Rights Division’s website.

INTRODUCTION   \n \nA. \t On October 31, 2008, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) to \nresolve the Department of Justice’s investigation of alleged unlawful conditions at the \nLos Angeles County Probation Camps (“Probation Camps” or “Camps”), commenced \npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. ' 1997 \n(“CRIPA”), and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. \n' 14141 (“Section 14141”).  The MOA was the result of a cooperative effort by the \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) and the County of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County \nProbation Department, and the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health \n(collectively, “the County”) to guarantee and protect the federally protected rights of \nyouth committed to the Probation Camps. \n \nB. \t MOA paragraph 48 requires that the County achieve and maintain substantial compliance \nwith the terms of the MOA for a period of one year.  The MOA further provides, at \nparagraph 62, that the MOA shall terminate four years from its effective date, or \nOctober 31, 2012. Accordingly, to fully satisfy the MOA, the County was required to \nreach substantial compliance with the MOA by October 31, 2011, and maintain this \ncompliance until October 31, 2012.  The parties jointly selected a Monitoring Team to \nevaluate and report on the County’s compliance.  Under MOA paragraph 62, DOJ \nreserved the right to initiate a civil action pursuant to CRIPA and/or Section 14141 to \nenforce the MOA and protect the federal rights of youth if the County failed to fully \nsatisfy the MOA within the four-year period.   \n \nC. \t The County has implemented significant reforms in furtherance of the MOA, as reflected \nin the Monitoring Team’s biannual reports.  Based on these reports, the County has \nachieved substantial compliance with all but four paragraphs in sections III through VI, \nwhich set out the substantive terms of the MOA (the substantive paragraphs).  Despite \nthese accomplishments, the County is unable to maintain one year of substantial \ncompliance to fully satisfy the terms of the MOA by the bright-line termination date of  \nOctober 31, 2012. \n \nD. \t In light of the County’s significant strides toward compliance and its ongoing \ncommitment to reform, the parties agree to modify the MOA, pursuant to paragraph 72, \nas set forth below. The modification is intended to focus attention on resolving the MOA \nparagraphs not yet in compliance by eliminating the October 31, 2012 bright-line \ntermination date and building on reforms already in place, as verified by the Monitoring \nTeam’s most recent compliance evaluations.  Section III of this Amendment clarifies the \nfour remaining substantive paragraphs to achieve desired outcomes and facilitate ongoing \ncompliance assessments.  Section IV of this Amendment adds paragraph 73 to increase \nyouth’s access to community-based services to promote rehabilitation, consistent with \npublic safety and the best interests of youth. \n2   \n \n\n  \n \nII.  \tAMENDMENTS TO SECTION VII OF THE MOA REGARDING \n MONITORING  AND ENFORCEMENT  \n \n  Pursuant to MOA paragraph 72, the parties hereby agree to modify the monitoring and \nenforcement paragraphs as follows: \n \nA. \t Termination and Enforcement: The parties agree to eliminate the four-year termination \nrequirement of MOA paragraph 62.  The parties further agree that the MOA may \nterminate on December 31, 2014, subject to the following conditions:   \n \n1.\t   The County has maintained one year of substantial compliance with the following \nsubstantive paragraphs in sections III through VI of the MOA:  11, 13, 14, 16, 23, 24, \n25, 26, 34, 42, 46, 58 and 59. Accordingly, these paragraphs are fully satisfied and \nshall terminate as of the effective date of this Amendment.  Paragraph 59 has been \ndeemed to be substantially compliant in prior Monitoring Reports.  The County, \nconsistent with the requirements of paragraph 59, shall continue to provide any newly \ncreated or revised policies to the DOJ, for review and approval for the duration of this \nagreement for any substantive paragraphs that have not yet completed the twelve-\nmonth substantial compliance monitoring period.   \n \n2.\t   The County must achieve substantial compliance with all remaining substantive \nparagraphs in sections III through VI of the MOA by December 31, 2013.  The \nCounty will make all reasonable efforts to comply prior to this date.   \n \n3.\t   The MOA, as amended, will terminate when the County:  (1) implements all \nparagraphs in MOA sections III-VI pursuant to paragraph 48, and (2) implements \nparagraph 73 as set forth in Section IV.A.9.  The requirements of paragraph 48 shall \nnot apply to paragraph 73. Should the County fail to implement this Amendement or \notherwise fail to satisfy its terms, DOJ reserves the right to initiate a civil action \npursuant to CRIPA and/or Section 14141, or take other appropriate enforcement \naction, to protect the constitutional and federal statutory rights of youth committed or \nsupervised by the County. \n \nB. \t Implementation of Remaining Paragraphs:  In accordance with the Monitoring Team’s \ncompliance assessments, and to ensure the full implementation and sustainability of  \nreforms, the parties agree to the following implementation schedule for the remaining \nsubstantive paragraphs in sections III through VI of the MOA: \n \n1. \t  Paragraphs that Must Maintain Substantial Compliance: According to the Monitoring \nTeam, the County has achieved substantial compliance with the following substantive \nparagraphs of the MOA: 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, \n36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, and 45. The parties agree that the County has achieved \nsubstantial compliance with these paragraphs, but has yet to maintain one year of \nsubstantial compliance.   \n \n3   \n \n\n  \n \na. \t  If paragraphs 12, 18, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, \n41, 44, and 45 maintain substantial compliance through October 31, 2012, \nthese paragraphs shall be fully satisfied and shall terminate as of that date.   \n \nb. \t  For paragraphs 9, 10, 19, and 37, to ensure the sustainability of reforms, the \nparties agree that, notwithstanding the date on which each paragraph was \ndeemed to be in substantial compliance by the Monitoring Team, the County \nshall maintain substantial compliance with each paragraph through \nDecember 31, 2012.  The Monitoring Team shall continue to evaluate and \nreport on the status of these paragraphs through December 31, 2012.  \nThereafter, based on the Monitoring Team’s assessment, if the County has \nmaintained substantial compliance by December 31, 2012, the paragraphs will \nno longer be subject to status reporting by the Monitoring Team, pursuant to \nMOA paragraph 54.  The County agrees to continue to implement the policies, \nprocedures, and practices related to these paragraphs for the life of the MOA \nto ensure that the constitutional and federal statutory rights of youth in the \nCounty’s custody or supervision are upheld.    \n \nc. \t  If any paragraph falls out of substantial compliance prior to termination of that \nparagraph, the County shall bring such paragraph into substantial compliance \nno later than December 31, 2013, and shall maintain such substantial \ncompliance for a period of one year.  The County shall make all reasonable \nefforts to bring all paragraphs into substantial compliance at the earliest \npossible date. \n \n  2. \t Paragraphs that Must Achieve Substantial Compliance: According to the   \n    Monitoring Team, the County has not achieved substantial compliance with the  \n    following substantive paragraphs of the MOA: 15, 17, 43, and 47. The County \n    agrees to achieve substantial compliance with these paragraphs by  \nDecember 31, 2013.  Once substantial compliance is achieved, the County agrees \nto maintain one year of substantial compliance.  The paragraphs will continue to \nbe subject to status reporting by the Monitoring Team until each paragraph \nmaintains one year of substantial compliance and is terminated.  Any paragraph \nthat does not achieve substantial compliance by December 31, 2013, shall be \nsubject to enforcement under Section II.A.3 of this Amendment.  To ensure the \nsustainability of reforms, the parties agree to retain paragraph 47 until such time \nas all other substantive paragraphs of the Agreement, except for paragraph 73, are \nin full compliance.   \n \nC. \t All other monitoring and enforcement paragraphs in section VII of the MOA shall remain \nunchanged and in full force and effect for the life of this MOA, subject to further joint \nmodification by the parties, pursuant to MOA paragraph 72.   \n \n4   \n \n\n  \n \nIII.  \t AMENDMENTS TO SUBSTANTIVE PARAGRAPHS IN MOA SECTIONS III \n  THROUGH VI \n \n  Pursuant to MOA paragraph 72, the parties agree to modify the following four \nsubstantive paragraphs to clarify expectations and facilitate ongoing compliance assessments by \nthe Monitoring Team. \n \nA. \t Paragraph 15, Staffing:  The County shall provide sufficient staff supervision to   \n  keep residents reasonably safe from harm and allow rehabilitative activities to    \n  occur successfully. \n \n1.\t   Direct care staff shall include only those staff members whose primary role is the \ndirect supervision of youth. \n \n2.\t   The County  agrees to strengthen its current hiring practices by ensuring that all \nnewly hired staff who have contact with youth in the County's juvenile justice \nsystem are subject to an appropriate hiring process and are otherwise qualified to \nwork with youth.   The hiring process shall include a background check, including \na federal criminal history check and consultation of State and local child abuse \nregistries, and a reference check. For current employees, the County shall either \nconduct criminal background record checks at least every five years or have in \nplace a system for capturing such information.  The County shall directly ask \napplicants for, and employees in, positions  that result in contact with youth in the \nCounty's juvenile justice system, about prior criminal misconduct during \ninterviews and reviews. The County shall ensure that employees have a \ncontinuing affirmative duty to disclose any criminal misconduct.   \n \n3.\t   On a monthly basis, the County shall gather and analyze data including, but not \nlimited to, staffing ratios at each facility, vacancy rates, and staff turnover. The \nCounty shall adjust existing policies and practices as needed to comply with this \nparagraph based on analysis of this data. \n \nB. \t Paragraph 17, Rehabilitation and Behavior Management: \n \n1.  \tRehabilitation:  The County shall provide adequate rehabilitative and gender-\nspecific programming, as necessary.  The County shall continue to conduct \nappropriate individualized assessments by qualified staff. \n \na. \t The County shall develop and provide integrated treatment services that \nmeet the rehabilitative needs of youth at all Probation Camps.  These \nservices shall adequately:  (i) address youth’s educational needs (including \naccess to special education services); (ii) provide access to medical and \nmental health services, including substance abuse treatment; (iii) provide a \nstructured living environment that facilitates, reinforces, and provides \nopportunities for youth to practice pro-social skills and pro-social \nrelationships with other youth and adults; (iv) provide access to \n5   \n \n\n  \n \nmeaningful recreational and enrichment activities; (v) provide \nopportunities for family involvement; (vi) encourage development of new \nskills; and (vii) include Camp staff as positive role models.   \n \nb. \t Within 10 business days of a youth’s arrival at a Camp, the County shall \nensure that the youth receives an individualized assessment of the youth’s \nrehabilitation needs by a multidisciplinary team in all relevant areas, \nincluding, but not limited to:  education, recreation,  psychosocial \ndevelopment, and mental health.  This multidisciplinary assessment shall \nconsider the Camps Assessment Unit’s (“CAU’s”) assessment of the \nyouth. Based on this multidisciplinary assessment, the County shall \nformulate a comprehensive service plan, including case plan goals for \nrehabilitation and treatment, for each youth.   \n \nc. \t The County shall ensure that each Camp offers the necessary rehabilitative  \ntreatment, programs, and services to meet the needs of youth housed there, \nconsistent with safety and security needs, based on the assessments and \ntreatment plans described in Section III.B.1.b., above.  Such offerings \nshall include, but shall not be limited to, group therapy or individual \ncounseling for each youth, as necessary.    \n \nd. \t At Camps providing an adapted Dialectical Behavior Therapy (“DBT”) \nprogram, the County shall create a detailed program description for the \nDBT program to include, but not be limited to, the purpose; goals; desired \nresults; target populations; expectations for staff training and program  \ndelivery; and type, intensity, and duration of services to be provided. \n \n    e. \t In the Camps that do not offer DBT, the County shall implement an  \n   integrated  treatment program  that uses an interdisciplinary approach to  \n      identify and meet youth’s individualized rehabilitation needs.   \n \nf. \t The County shall ensure that existing staff demonstrate competency, and \nnew staff receive sufficient competency-based training, to fully implement \nthe rehabilitative interventions in III.B.d and e.    \n \n    g. \t The County shall ensure that each rehabilitative treatment, program, and  \n      service at each Camp offers sufficient capacity to allow youth who need  \n      the treatment, program, or service to participate in it.  The County shall \n      ensure that youth attend their prescribed programs, as outlined in their  \n      treatment plans.  The youth’s caseworker shall regularly report to the  \nyouth’s treatment team and document the youth’s progress in meeting his \nor her case plan goals. Youth who are not meeting their case plan goals \nshall receive prompt subsequent, individualized assessments and follow-\nup. \n   \n6   \n \n\n  \n \nh. \t The County shall ensure that its rehabilitation and intervention programs \ncontinue to address youth’s needs related to peer pressure and gang \naffiliation.   \n \n2.  \tBehavior Management:  The County shall provide a facility-wide behavior \nmanagement system that is implemented throughout the day, including during \nschool time.  The behavior management system shall encourage meaningful \nrewards for positive behavior.  Discipline and sanctions shall not be arbitrary.  \nThe County shall continue to develop the behavior management program in \nconsultation with the Monitoring Team. \n \n    a. \t The County shall implement the behavior management system in    \n   accordan ce with the following schedule and based on the effective date of  \n   this  Amendment: \n \n(i) \t Within 30 days, the County shall complete detailed, written \nguidance for its behavior management system.   \n \n      (ii) \t  Within 60 days, the County shall provide staff with competency- \n        based training on the behavior management system.  \n \n      (iii) \t Within 60 days, the County shall introduce the behavior    \n        management system to youth, including by providing youth with  \n    orientation  and written guidance on the system and initiating the  \n        system in all Probation Camps.  The written guidance shall be \n    m ade available to youth in the dorm and at orientation thereafter. \n \n    b. \t The County shall ensure that its behavior management system includes  \n   specific,  consistent  requirements and behavioral expectations for each part \n      of the day during which youth can earn points.  The County shall ensure  \n      that each segment of each day is consistently rated for all youth, every \n                                    day, in every Probation Camp.   \n \n    c. \t The County shall provide a comprehensive array of short- and long-term   \n      incentives at each Probation Camp and shall ensure that youth have access \n      to all rewards and privileges to which they are entitled.  The ability to  \n      purchase items from a store on a weekly basis may be part of this array,  \nbut it shall not be the only incentive offered. \n \nd. \t The County shall use a continuum of individualized consequences in \nresponse to non-compliant behavior or rule violations at each Probation \nCamp.  The County shall ensure that isolation may be used only as a last \nresort on this continuum, and only in response to violent or aggressive \nbehavior; to prevent violent or aggressive or criminal behavior, including \nextreme and chronic disruptive behavior; or for the minor’s own \nprotection. \n7   \n \n\n  \n \n \ni. \t  The County, with input from the Monitors, shall draft and \nimplement a policy that enumerates the types of behaviors that \ncould result in a referral to isolation and requires detailed written \njustification for sending a youth to isolation, maintaining the youth \nin isolation, and removing the youth from isolation.   \n \nii. \t  The County shall ensure that the period of isolation is based on the \nyouth’s behavior, or the threat to the youth, rather than on a pre-\ndetermined period.  Youth who are in isolation must receive at \nleast one hour of large muscle activity for every 24 hours in \nisolation, unless the youth is actively violent or aggressive, such \nthat removing the youth from isolation presents a significant risk of \nharm to the youth or others.  Youth whose isolation extends \nbeyond 24 hours shall receive a due process hearing.  The isolation \npolicy shall be subject to DOJ review and approval.  \n \n3. \t As part of its evaluation to determine whether the implementation of paragraph \n17, as amended, is meeting the rehabilitation needs of youth and contributing to \nimproved conditions, the Monitoring Team  shall consider factors including the \nfollowing, as appropriate: \n \n(i)   Us\te of isolation and reasons thereof;  \n(ii)  Rat\te of youth-on-youth and youth-on-staff violence; \n(iii) \t Progress toward meeting treatment goals as determined by the \nmultidisciplinary team (“MDT”); \n (iv)  You\t th transfers to other Probation Camps for security or safety  \npurposes; \n(v)  Rat\te of self-harming behaviors; \n(vi)  Num\t ber of youth sent to outside facilities for mental health  \n    evalua tion or  treatment; \n(vii)  Use \tof behavior management rewards and consequences; and \n(viii) \t Number of early or on-time releases.  \n \nC. \t Paragraph 43, Substance Abuse:  The County shall develop and implement policies, \n  procedures, and practices to address substance use disorders appropriately.  The County \n  agrees to take the following steps:  \n \n1. \t  Identify youth with substance abuse disorders. \n \n2. \t  Ensure that youth who (1) have a confirmed substance abuse diagnosis/disorder or \n(2) are otherwise identified as needing substance abuse treatment, receive \nsubstance abuse treatment.  If a youth refuses treatment, the County shall \ndocument the refusal and make reasonable attempts to re-direct the youth back to \ntreatment. \n \n8   \n \n\n  \n \n3. \t  Reevaluate for a substance abuse disorder/diagnosis any youth who has not been \nidentified as having such a disorder/diagnosis, upon determination that the youth \nfalls into one of the following categories:      \n \na. \t  youth has a positive screening on the substance abuse scale of any screening \nor assessment measure used by the County; \n \nb.\t   youth self reports a significant history of substance use;   \n \nc. \t  youth has used illegal drugs at the Camps or in County custody; and/or \n \nd. \t  youth has been referred for substance abuse treatment by staff.      \n \n4. \t Ensure that each Camp offers evidence-based substance abuse treatment services  \nor programs by: \n \na. \t identifying the evidence-based treatment service or program to be used at \neach Camp;  \n \n    b. \t implementing the service or program at each Camp; and  \n \n  c. \t ensuring that the service or program  has sufficient capacity to ensure that \nall eligible youth at each Camp may participate.   \n \n5. \t Take reasonable steps to prevent youth from having access to illegal drugs at the \nCamps.   \n \n6. \t As part of its evaluation to determine whether the implementation of paragraph \n43, as amended, is addressing the substance abuse treatment needs of youth and \ncontributing to improved conditions, the Monitoring Team shall consider the \nfollowing factors, as appropriate: \n \na. \t  number of incidents of youth previously treated for substance abuse \ntreatment at the Camps who subsequently use illegal drugs at the Camps; \n \nb.\t   Progress toward meeting substance abuse treatment-related goals, as \ndetermined by the MDT;  \n \nc. \t  Number of youth referred for substance abuse treatment;  \n \nd.\t   Number of youth who complete substance abuse treatment programming;  \n \ne. \t  Results of County-administered pre- and post-tests regarding substance \nabuse.   \n \n9   \n \n\n  \n \nD. \t Paragraph 47, System: The County shall continue to collect sufficient and reliable data \nto evaluate the implementation of the paragraphs of this Agreement.  The County shall \nrevise and/or institute quality assurance systems to ensure implementation of the \nparagraphs addressed in this Agreement.  The County shall continue to analyze the data \ncollected in its quality assurance systems and proactively and independently take \ncorrective action, including adjusting the delivery and/or content of programs and \ncollection of performance indicators, when results indicate that such action is needed.   \n \nIV. \t ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH  \n \nPursuant to MOA paragraph 72, the parties hereby agree to add paragraph 73 to the MOA.  As \nset forth below, the County agrees to promote the rehabilitation of youth by increasing access to \ncommunity-based alternatives, consistent with public safety and the best interests of the youth.  \n \nA. \t  Paragraph 73, Increased Access to Community Alternatives: To ensure that treatment and \nservices referenced in the MOA are provided in the least restrictive setting, consistent with \npublic safety, the best interests of the youth, and the goal of rehabilitation, the County agrees \nto take the following steps:  \n \n1.  \tMinimize Juvenile Hall Confinement: The County shall rely on juvenile hall \nconfinement only for youth who pose a risk to public safety and where the \nutilization of a less restrictive environment such as home, housing with a relative, \nassignment to the Community Detention Program, or assignment to a home that \nprovides temporary overnight housing based on the youth’s status such as a Pre-\nDetention Alternative (for youth pending a detention hearing) or a Status \nOffender Detention Alternative (for youth who is considered to be a non-\ndelinquent status offender), is not appropriate.  The following pre-detention \nalternatives, conducted by qualified staff, or local police agencies, as appropriate, \nshall be considered for youth prior to juvenile hall detention as appropriate: \n \na. \t Divert Minors from the Juvenile Justice System:  Local law enforcement \nagencies should consistently be encouraged to consider counsel and \nrelease for first-time, low-risk offenders to parents, guardians, or other \nresponsible adult in lieu of formal arrest and filing of criminal charges; \n \nb. \t Availability of Community Based Services:  Probation shall schedule in-\nservice collaborative events with local law enforcement agencies and \nintroduce them to the availability of community-based services to which \nyouth and their families can be referred for assistance/service in lieu of \narrest and/or detention. For example, youth could be referred to the local \nSchool-Based Probation Officer who will work with the youth and his/her \nfamily and align him/her with services as well as provide informal \nsupervision to the youth while attending school.      \n \n10   \n \n\n  \n \nc. \t Intake and Detention Control Officers shall, after conducting a risk \nassessment utilizing an evidence-based screening tool, consider the \nfollowing interventions options for youth: \n   \ni. \t Cite-back and release to parents, guardians, or other relatives with \na future court date within 60 days; \n \nii. \t  Community Detention Program with electronic monitoring \npending court hearing; or \n \niii. \t Detain in juvenile hall due to gravity of offense, screening results, \nor bench warrant that requires detention pending court hearing in \naccordance with state law.      \n \n2.  \tMinimize Camp  Confinement: Prior to the pre-plea being accepted or the petition \nbeing sustained, the County shall evaluate all placement options and recommend \nCamp confinement only for youth who pose a legitimate risk to public safety and \nwhere the utilization of a less restrictive environment (e.g., home on probation; \nhousing with a court-approved relative, while on probation; or a specialized \ncommunity placement, while on probation) is not appropriate.  The following pre-\nCamp-assignment review processes, conducted by qualified staff, shall be used \nprior to clearing a youth for Camp assignment: \n \na. \t  Court Reports: Prior to Disposition, the County shall ensure that \nProbation staff completes a detailed assessment of the youth that will \ninclude pertinent, available information about the youth to produce a \ndetailed recommendation to the court regarding the youth’s most \nappropriate disposition in the least restrictive setting, consistent with \npublic safety, the best interests of the youth, and the goal of rehabilitation. \n \nb. \t  Overview of Alternatives to Incarceration for Lower-level Offenders:   \nProbation shall actively collaborate (on an on-going basis) with Bench \nOfficers (judges) and affirm the availability of a formal grant of  \nCommunity-Based Probation that will be enhanced through referral to \ncommunity-based services for youth and their families for \nassistance/service/support as an alternative to incarceration.   \n \nc. \t  Out of Home Screening Unit:  All court reports recommending Camp  \nCommunity Placement (“CCP”) shall be reviewed by the “Out of Home  \nScreening Unit.”  This unit shall assess these recommendations and determine \nthe appropriateness of the recommendation.   This unit shall endeavor to \nrecommend placement of youth in community-based alternatives to \nincarceration to the maximum extent possible.   \n \nd. \t  Camps Assessment Unit:  Upon the court issuing an order for CCP, the CAU \nshall review the recommendation for appropriateness, review the minor’s case \n11   \n \n\n  \n \nfile, consult with mental health, education and health services and determine \nthe most appropriate Camp placement for the youth consistent with public \nsafety, the best interests of youth, and the goal of rehabilitation, and assign the \nyouth to that Camp. \n \n3.  \tIn-Camp Services/Re-entry:  The County shall ensure that youth assigned to the \nCamps receive the following services, that are consistent with the County’s goals \nof ensuring the public safety and rehabilitation of youth, and to ensure that youth \nare confined to Camps for no longer than necessary: \n \na. \t  Each youth shall receive an initial MDT Assessment within fourteen (14) \ndays of arrival at the Camp: \n \ni. \t  The MDT shall further review the documentation that resulted in \nthe youth’s CCP. If the CCP order appears to be contrary to the \nyouth’s treatment and service needs, or if the particular Camp  \nassignment appears to be inappropriate, the case will be referred \nback to the CAU for consideration; and \n \nii. \t  This collaborative MDT of Probation, the Department of Mental \nHealth (DMH), Juvenile Court Health Services (JCHS) and Los \nAngeles County Office of Education (LACOE) representatives \nshall determine the in-Camp programming and service needs of \nyouth, and facilitate initiation of the case plan and community \ntransition plan for the youth; \n \nb.\t   Each youth’s assigned Probation Officer at the Camp shall: \n \ni. \t  Meet with the youth upon the case plan being initiated; \n \nii. \t  Meet regularly (weekly) thereafter with the youth (and the family, \nin person or via telephone or other available means, to the extent \nreasonably possible consistent with the youth’s needs and/or case \nplan) and shall monitor and document weekly, the youth’s progress \nand compliance with the case plan while in Camp; \n \niii. \t  Closely monitor the youth’s behavior and progress to determine \neligibility for an early release recommendation to the court to \nassure that youth are not incarcerated in Camp for any longer than \nnecessary.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  On November 9, 2006, the United States, through the DOJ, \nnotified the then-Chair of the Los Angeles County Board of \nSupervisors, Mayor Michael D. Antonovich,  of DOJ’s intent to \ninvestigate conditions of confinement at the Probation Camps to \ndetermine whether those conditions violated youth’s \nconstitutional or federal statutory rights.  The United States \nconducted this investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of \nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (“CRIPA”), and \nthe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 \nU.S.C. § 14141 (“Section 14141\"). \n2.  Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, \nthe United States issued its findings that certain conditions at \nthe Probation Camps violated youth’s constitutional and federal \nstatutory rights and subjected them to harm. \n- 2 -\n\n3.  As a result of the County's high level of voluntary \ncooperation and willingness to implement meaningful change \nwithout the need for contested litigation, the DOJ and the County \nbelieve this Agreement, rather than contested litigation, \nrepresents the best opportunity to address the DOJ's findings \nregarding the Probation Camps. \n4.  This Agreement is binding upon the parties, by and \nthrough their officials, agents, employees, and successors.  This \nAgreement is enforceable only by the parties.  No person or \nentity is intended to be a third-party beneficiary of the \nprovisions of this Agreement for purposes of any civil, criminal, \nor administrative action, and accordingly, no person or entity \nmay assert any claim or right as a beneficiary or protected class \nunder this Agreement.  This Agreement is not intended to impair \nor expand the right of any person or organization to seek relief \nagainst the County for its conduct or the conduct of Los Angeles \nCounty Department of Probation employees; accordingly, it does \nnot alter legal standards governing any such claims, including \nthose under California law.  This Agreement does not authorize, \nnor shall it be construed to authorize, access to any County, \nProbation Camp, contractor, or DOJ documents by persons or \nentities other than the DOJ, the County, and the Monitoring Team. \nThis Agreement does not authorize a violation of California law \nby the County, except to the extent that State law is pre-empted \n- 3 -\n\nby federal law. \n5.  The County is responsible for providing necessary \nsupport to the Probation Camps to fulfill their obligations under \nthis Agreement. \n6.  The County, by and through its officials, agents, \nemployees, and successors, shall not engage in a pattern or \npractice of conduct at the Probation Camps that deprives youth \nresidents of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or \nprotected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. \n7.  The County will revise and/or develop as necessary its \ncurrent policies, procedures, protocols, training curricula, and \npractices to ensure that they are consistent with, incorporate, \naddress, and implement all provisions of this Agreement.

County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nBackground  \n \nOn November 6, 2006, the United S tates Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an investigation \nto focus on whether youth were adequately prot ected from har m at the Los Angeles County \nProbation Department Camps, pursuant to the Ci vil Rights of Institu tionalized Persons Act \n(CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, and the Violent Cr ime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, \n42 U.S.C. § 14141. \n \nOn October 31, 2008, the Departm ent of Justice  submitted a “Findings Letter” to the Los \nAngeles County Board of Supervisors, outlini ng areas requiring rem edial attention by the \nProbation Department and the Department of Mental Health (DMH).   \n \nOn October 31, 2008, the DOJ and t he Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved and \nfully executed the final settlement agreement entitled, “Memorandum of Agreement Between the \nUnited States and the County of Los Angeles  Regarding the Los Angeles Probation Cam ps” \n(hereafter, referred t o in t his  report and future reports as th e “Agreement” or “MOA”).  The \nAgreement initially allowed the  County to address the areas of  concern over a four-year period \nunder the supervision of a mutually agreed upon project monitoring team which included experts \nin the fields of psychiatry, m ental health, sa fety, juvenile justice program s, and juvenile \ndetention practices. \n \nAmendment to the M OA:   The MOA was to term inate on October 31, 2012.  Prior to the \ntermination, the parties executed the Second Amendment to the MOA (hereinafter referred to as \n“Amendment”).   \n \nThe Amendment recognized the County’s significan t reforms in furtherance of the MOA, and \nsignificant ef forts towa rd com pliance in  the  Pa ragraphs that would not  have achieved the \nrequired level of compliance by the  termination date.  The MOA, as am ended, eliminates the  \nfour-year termination requirement, and allows for a term ination date of Dece mber 31, 2014, \nsubject to specific conditions.  With the exception of Paragraphs 9, 10, 19 and 37, any Paragraph \nthat had achieved and maintained Substantial Co mpliance for one year on or before October 31, \n2012, would be fully satisfied and term inate on th e date of the completion of  the year of   \nsustained Substantial Compliance.  To ensure sustainability of the reforms, Paragraphs 9, 10, 19, \nand 37, which would have com pleted one year of Substantial Compliance on October 31, 2012, \nwere required to maintain Substantial Compliance through December 31, 2012, after which they  \nwould no longer be subject to status reporting. \n \nThe Amendment modified Paragraphs 15, 17, 43, a nd 47 to clarify expecta tions and facilitate  \nongoing compliance assessm ents by the m onitoring team, and added a new Paragraph 73 to \npromote the rehabilitation of youth by increasi ng access to community-bas ed alternatives to \nincarceration, consistent with public safety and the best interests of the youth. \n \nThe Amendment is included in the appendices to this report.  \n \nCompliance Monitoring:  The Agreement stipulated the appointment of Michael Graham as the \nLead Monitor.  The Lead Monitor is respons ible for overseeing the com pliance monitoring \n4  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nefforts of four other jointly  agreed upon monitoring team members as they assess the County’s \nprogress toward addressing and com plying w ith the 42 provisions of the Agreem ent as \narticulated in Paragraphs 9-47, 58, 59, and 73.  \n \nDuring the first eighteen months of their monitoring responsibilities, each of the Monitors was \nrequired to conduct initial visits to each of the 18 Probation Department Camps and the Dorothy \nKirby Center to review and repo rt on the County’s progress to ward complying with provisions \nwithin the sphere of their re spective monitoring responsibilities.  Currently, m onitoring team \nmembers visit a sample of those and other facilities at varying intervals as necessary to assess the \nCounty’s progress, or as directed by the Lead Monitor.  The Monitors will continu e to visit the \nfacilities until such time as the County reach es compliance with each  of the provisions th e \nmonitoring team  members oversee. \n \nA report from  the Monitors is required twice a nnually, or as directed by the parties.  This \nEleventh Monitoring Report covers January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014. \n \n \nProgress to Date \n \nMonitoring Visits:  The Monitors continue to  visit the County facilities to assess compliance \nwith the Agreement. During their visits, the Monitors may tour the facilities, meet with staff and \nadministrators, inte rview m inors, review records, and observe  specialized m eetings. W here  \nappropriate, their observations are provided to the County and, when  present, the Department of \nJustice during or at the conclusion of these visits.  The Monitors also review reports, documents, \nand audits requested of and provided by the County. \n \nMonitoring Reports:  Although the for mat of these sem i-annual reports has changed over the \nlife of the MOA, the format of this Eleventh Monitoring Report remains the same as that of the \nlast report.  The five Paragra phs that are currently being m onitored are listed first.  Each   \nParagraph includes the MOA  requirement followed by the  Monitor’s com pliance leve l \nassessment (Full Compliance, Substantial  Compliance, Par tial Com pliance, or  Non-\nCompliance); the Cou nty’s se lf-assessment; the Monito r’s discus sion of  the basis f or the \ncompliance level assessment; and the evidentiary basis for the compliance level assessment.  The \nMonitors also provide recomm endations to assi st the County in m aintaining or increasing the \ncompliance level of the Paragraph the recommendations follow.  However, the recommendations \nare not to be construed as substitutes for the requirements of the MOA, or as a complete listing  \nof actions to be taken in order to gain full compliance with any provision. \n \nFollowing the reports on the Para graphs currently being m onitored, we have listed the \nParagraphs of the Agreem ent that have already achieved Fu ll Compliance and are no longer   \nbeing monitored.  Those Paragraphs are included  with their compliance completion date so the \nreader will be able to review the County’s progress toward achieving compliance with the terms \nof the MOA. \n \n \n5  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nStatus:  As noted in the Background section, the MOA was intended to terminate on October 31, \n2012.  Prior to the termination, the parties executed the Second Amendment to the MOA.   The  \nMOA, as amended, eliminated the original four-year termination requirement, and allows f or a \ntermination date of December 31, 2014, subject to specific conditions.   One of the terms of the \nAmendment was that in or der to ensure sustainability of the reforms, Paragraphs 9, 10, 19, and \n37, which would have completed one year of Substantial Compliance on October 31, 2012, were \nrequired to m aintain Substantial Complian ce through December 31, 2012, after which they \nwould no longer be subject to status reporting  by the Monitoring Team .  Paragraphs 9, 10, 17, \nand 37 did remain in Substantial Compliance through December 31, 2012, and were determ ined \nto be in Full Com pliance. As this monitor ing period began, 37 of the Paragraphs were in Full \nCompliance, and only Paragraphs 15, 17, 43, 47, and 73 remained subject to monitoring.  \n \nParagraph 43 was placed in Substantial Compliance on June 13, 2013. The County demonstrated \nits commitment to high-quality su bstance abuse services during the curre nt monitoring period \nand has successfully completed the 12-m onth compliance monitoring period.  This provision is \nno longer subject to monitoring.   \n \nIn previous reports’ discussion of  Paragraph 15, we have cited a  lack of adequate staffing to \nprovide necessary programming and to properly supervise youth.  Staffing levels have continued \nto improve and concerns about the adequacy of staffing have lessened.  There are still, however, \noccasions when staffing issues do surface.  This is an area that requ ires the continued vigilance \nof the County.  Having an adequate number of staff to assure the safety of the minors in a facility \nis the foundation of any successful juvenile program.  Without a safe environment the County’s \nefforts to build a rehabilitative milieu at the camps cannot succeed.  \n \nDuring this monitoring period the County has con tinued to work to re-enforce and enhance it s \npersonnel practices in an effort to im prove the hiring and retention of Camp Probation Officers.  \nIt is also working to im prove the pre-em ployment screening process.  The County has \nimplemented an im proved hiring process that s hould assist in achieving  the County’s goal of \nhiring the most qualified applicants.  The C ounty has implem ented use of the Live-Scan \nfingerprint system that has the capability to notify the Probation Department of contact between \nits employees and a law enforcement agency.  The County has also established and implemented \na process whereby current em ployees are dir ectly asked about any  contact with a la w \nenforcement agency, an d retained a policy by  which each em ployee is required to  report any \ncontact with law enforcem ent officials.    Paragraph 15 was placed in substantial com pliance \neffective November 1, 2013.  \n \nThe County continues to provide the high- quality behavior m anagement program  and \nrehabilitative services require d by Provision 17.  Using a syst em of auditing and corrective \naction planning, the Camps solidified practices surrounding the mechanics of the Merit Ladder’s \npoint sheets, Stage promotion a nd Early Release tracking, the use of Sanctions, and procedures \nto limit youths’ exposure to isolation. At all Ca mps, youths’ needs are rigorously assessed and \nthey are enrolled in rehabilitative programming that is responsive to those needs.  Camps have a \nsufficient range of program  types and sufficien t capacity within thos e programs to m eet the \nneeds of youth. The audit tools for this provision  have been redesigned to ensure an adequate   \nfocus on outcomes. \n6  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nAs noted above, the County continue s to be in substantial com pliance with the requirements of  \nParagraph 43, and has now achieved Full Complia nce.  Ca mps have a variety of treatm ent  \nmodalities (groups of varying in tensities and  individual treatm ent) availab le to respond to \nyouth’s needs for substance abuse treatm ent.  Completion rates for the va rious substance abuse \ntreatment groups are 80% or better, and youth de monstrate increased knowledge of the harm s  \nassociated with their drug use as a result of these interventions.  The audit tools were revised to \nensure they accurately capture pro gram completion data and various glitches in the source \ndocuments were resolved to provide a dependable foundation for the audits. \n \nParagraphs 15, 17, and 47 were placed in Substa ntial Compliance effective November 1, 2013.  \nThe County demonstrated the required level of  performance throughout the current monitoring \nperiod. If appropriate performance levels are maintained, the  compliance monitoring period for \nthose provisions will conclude on October 31, 2014. \n \nWe commend the County for its continued  emphasis on outcomes as it revises its policies and   \nprocedures, and its tracking and audit tools.  Although covered as part of Paragraphs 47 and 73 -\n7, some specific recom mendations for these quality assurance tools may also be found in the \ndiscussions of the other Paragraphs. \n \nThe County is making progress in addressing the requirements of Paragraph 73.  While some of \nthe Paragraph’s sub-sections are in or are closer  to being in Substantial Compliance than others, \nall of the sections must be determined to be in Substantial Compliance  to end monitoring of the  \nprovision. There remain some significant hurdles. \n \nWhile the County is on track to complete the va lidation of the LADS ( its detention screening \ninstrument) by the end of 2014, the analysis has uncovered some significant hurdles to the proper \nimplementation of the LADS that will need to be articulated in detail.  The extremely high rate of  \noverrides of the youth’s LADS score compromises the County’s ability to reduce its reliance on \nsecure detention for low and medium risk offenders.  Some of the override categories are outside \nof the County’s control, but m any more are within the County’s authority to adjust.  W hile the \nCounty does not have to actually m ake changes to the override policies or create the non-secure \nalternative programs that are needed to house medi um risk offenders appropriately in order to \nfulfill its obligation under the MOA, it does need to draft a credible validation report that shines  \na light on the issues that cont ribute to the poor implementation of the LADS.  The Monitor will \ncontinue to work closely with the County as they develop this final product.  \n \nAlthough the County has been holding the collaborative events with law enforcement agencies as \nrequired by Paragraph 73-1, the meetings did not satisfy the intent of the section.  The Monitors \nwill continue to work with the Co unty to ens ure compliance in f uture training material and \nmeetings. \n \nWith regard to 73-3, the County has met most of the requirements of the MOA. However, it must \ncontinue to increase the rate of participation  by Aftercare POs in the Transitional MDT meetings, \nand increase their overall level of  contact with youth prior to release.  Finally, audit tools need to \nbe adjusted slightly to capture the outcom es required by the MOA and to adequately m onitor \nprogram performance.   \n7  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \nAftercare POs also need to m ake more tim ely post-release hom e visits, and m ake follow-up \ncontacts with youth, th eir families, and service providers on a more consistent basis.   Finally,  \naudit tools still need to be im plemented or  modified to dem onstrate the County’s internal \ncapacity to monitor program performance in this area.  \n \nIn past reports we commended the County for continuing to report compliance data for som e of \nthe paragraphs that had already com pleted  monitoring.  It dem onstrated the County’s \ncommitment to sustaining its reforms.  The County has not provided similar compliance data for \nthis report.  It has been the sincere hope of the Monitoring Team that the important auditing and \ncompliance oversight efforts of the Probation D epartment’s Quality As surance Services Unit,  \nand the Auditor-Controller continues beyond the life of this MOA  to prevent a recurrence of the \nabuses and lapses that resulted in this MOA.  The County assures us, however, that they have not \nabandoned their efforts to monitor the areas already in compliance.  They explain that the lack of \ndata was the temporary result of an effort to substantially refine and update their audit tools.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n8  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nMemorandum of Agreement Provisions  \n \n(Paragraphs in Monitoring) \nParagraph  15:  Staffing  (Probation)  \n \nThe County shall provide sufficien t staff supervision to keep resid ents reasonably safe fro m  \nharm and allow rehabilitative activities to occur successfully.  \nDirect care staff shall include only thos e staff members whose primary ro le is the d irect  \nsupervision of youth. \nThe County agrees to strengthen its current hiring  practices by ensuring that all newly hired \nstaff who have contact with youth in the County 's juvenile justice system are su bject to an \nappropriate hiring process and are otherwise qualified to work with youth. The hiring process \nshall include a background check, including a federal criminal history check and consultation  \nof State and local child abuse registries, an d a reference check. For  current employees, the \nCounty shall either con duct criminal background record checks at lea st every five years o r  \nhave in place a system for cap turing such  information. The County shall direc tly ask \napplicants for, and employees in, positions  that result in contact with youth in the County' s \njuvenile justice system, about prio r criminal misconduct during  interviews and reviews. The \nCounty shall ensure that employees have a  con tinuing affir mative duty to disclose any   \ncriminal misconduct. \nOn a monthly basis, the County shall gather an d analyze data including, but not limited to, \nstaffing ratios at each facility, vacancy rate s, and staff tu rnover. The County shall adjust \nexisting policies and practices as needed to co mply with this paragraph based on analysis of   \nthis data.  \n \nStatus: Substantial Compliance (effective November 1, 2013)  \n \nCounty’s Self-Assessment:  \n \nBackground Check Process  \nDuring this Monitoring Period the County has continued its efforts to strengthen the background \ncheck process in addition to enhance the existing expectat ion that employees of the Probation \nDepartment conduct them selves in a m anner c onsistent with the pr ofessional standards \ngoverning County employm ent by updating policy  and procedures.  Directive 1359, Arrest \nNotification and Use of Benefit Tim e, was re-issued on May 6, 2014. On May 12, 2014, this   \nDirective was em ailed to all Pr obation employees with a  mandatory requir ement that they   \ncomplete and sign a L aw Enforcement Contact (LEC) form and submit it to th eir Office Head \nadvising whether they have or  have not had Law Enforcem ent Contact as described in the \nDirective 1359. \n \n9  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nThis policy and procedure applies  to arrests, detentions, citations (except infractions), warrants,  \nsuspended/restricted licenses, restraining or ders, involuntary psychi atric evaluations or   \nobservations or commitments, and all situations where an employee is named as a subject of an \ninvestigation.  All em ployees are required to notify their superv isor or m anager of the facts   \nrelated to any arrests, detentions and citations within 24 hours and complete and submit the LEC  \nform to their supervisor.  The  supervisor is  to review and m odify the em ployee’s duties, if  \ndeemed necessary after consultatio n with th e affected Bureau(s), the Internal Affairs Office \nand/or Return-to-Work Unit where appropriate. \n \nAs of June 30, 2014, out of 5,435 em ployees, 4,454 or 82% LEC For ms were received.  Of \nthose, 19 reported some type of law enforcement contact within the last 12 months.  Taking into \naccount staff that are o ut on appro ved leave o f absence, LEC For ms were no t received from \n13.2% of the staff. Residential Treatm ent Services Bureau (RTSB) has 1,016 staff.  As of June   \n30, 2014, 88.4% of RTSB staff completed and  submitted the LEC Form.  Taking into account \nstaff that are out on approved leave of absence,  LEC Forms were not received from 8.6% of the \nRTSB staff.  As staf f that are ou t on approved leave of absence returns to work, they will b e  \nrequired to complete the Form when they return.  All new em ployee’s will be issued a copy of \nthis Directive during orientation and will be required to complete and sign a LEC form as part of  \nthe new hire process.  Corrective action will be taken for those  employees that do not com ply  \nwith completing the Form. \n \nThe County continues with its vigorous background  process for promotions and new hires.  The \nbackground investigation process for prom otions includes, but m ay not be lim ited to: a Live \nScan, electronic criminal records check, and internal clearances for significant concerns that may \nimpact the promotion.   New hires and transfer s into the Probation Depa rtment are treated the \nsame and i ncludes, but m ay not be lim ited to : a Live Scan, a crim inal records review, \nemployment history verification, credit ch eck, m edical exam , psychological screening, \nneighborhood canvassing and polygraph. \n \nThe County continu es to take advantage of th e State of California leg islation, Assembly Bill \n2343 – Crim inal History Inform ation, which expands the ability of the State Departm ent of \nJustice to in terface with and access nationwide s ubsequent arrests notices through  the Federal \nBureau of Investigations national database related to existing employees as well.  \n \nWeekly Staffing Meetings  \nThe Probation Department’s Executive Level Management Team continues to meet weekly with \nHuman Resources, the Staff Traini ng Office, and the Professional Standards Bureau to review \nand discuss staffing needs up to and including backfill strategies, recruitment efforts and results, \nacademy schedules, an d programmatic impacts as a  result of vac ancies.  In  addition to this \nmeeting, the Juvenile Institutions Bureau’s (JIB’s) Deputy Chief and Bureau Chiefs meet weekly \nto review staff m ovement reports prepared by Bureau Special A ssistant staff and to forecast \nstaffing needs and issues.  Lastly, the Residen tial Treatment Services Bureau Chief  engages  \nSenior Managers weekly regarding staffing and scheduling.  Seni or Managers are also provided \nwith staff movem ent forecasts as provided by  Human Resources  and Bureau s taff.  Various \nweekly reports, generated by Hum an Resources , the Backgrounds Investigations Unit, and \n10  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nBureau Assistants are closely rev iewed at th ese meetings when m aking decisions related to \nstaffing. \nStaffing Ratios  \nThe County implemented target staffing ratios in Residential Treatment Service Bureau (RTSB) \nfacilities based on the num ber of staff needed  to provide proper s upervision, m eaningful  \ncasework time, and to enhance th e facilitation  of Evidence Based treatm ents and program s.  \nDorothy Kirby maintains daytime (6 am  to 10 pm ) targeted staf f-to-minor ratios at 1:5; with \nCamps Scott and Onizuka at 1:6; Cam p Rockey at 1:7; Camp Scudder at  1:8; Camp McNair at \n1:9; and Camps Afflerbaugh, Paige,  Gonzales, Miller, Kilpatrick, Munz, Mendenhall and Jarvis \nat 1:10 \n \nThe County continues to maintain consistent staff-to-minor ratios on a daily basis within optimal \nlevels and at a higher standard  than state regulated ratios. Prev entative measures are effectively  \nensuring that the staff-to-minor ratios are sustained in the event of an unanticipated occurrence.  \nThe Managing Workforce and Addressi ng Staffing Shortages Memorandum  issued during the \nlast reporting period continues to provide dire ction to RTSB Managers and Supervisors with \nmethods to maintain target ratios during unanticip ated events impacting staffing ratios.  W ithin \nthe Memorandum, the facilities are instructed to partner with neighboring camps to pool staffing \nresources in order to assist with the transportation of youth and to iden tify staff willing to work  \nat a neighboring camp on short notice. \n \nStaff-to-Minor Ratio Reports  \nThe County continues to maintain monthly Staff-to-Minor Ratio Reports ensuring the target ratio \ncontinues to be met.  All cam ps maintained staff to minor ratio averages between January and \nJune 2014 at optim al levels, often surpassing the e xpected levels.  As can be seen in Figures \n15.1, 15.2, and 15.3 all cam ps met both state regul ated and Probation Department optim al \nstaffing standards as indicated by the maximum staff to minor ratio reported during the 6 month \nperiod. \n \nThe percentage of shifts with actual staffing ratios not at optimal levels, are minimal and remain \nin close range to optimal levels. The following are the findings of the Camp Staff-to-Minor Ratio  \nreports (only ratios that exceeded  the optimal targets or could be rounded to the n ext number \nabove optimal levels were included): \n \n\t   Camp Afflerbaugh experienced si x out of 362 shifts (1.7% of  all daytime shifts) where  \nstaffing ratios exceeded 1 : 10 supervision levels and reached 1 : 11 .6 (January 17, 2014 \nAM shift; February 24, 2014 AM shift; Apri l 30, 2014 AM shift;  May 23 and 29, 2014 \nAM shifts; and June 5, 2014 AM shift).  Notably, all of these shifts were during the AM  \nperiod on w eekdays where youth are in school  and auxiliary staff ar e assisting in the  \nsupervision and counseling of the youth. \n \n \t  Camp Paige experienced five out of 362 shifts (1.4% of all daytime shifts) where staffing \nratios reached up to 1 staff per 11.6 youth (January 17, 2014 AM shift; January 31, 2014 \nAM shift; February 2, 2014 PM  shift; February 3, 2014 A M shift).  Optimal levels for \nCamp Paige are 1 : 10.  \n11  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \t  Camp Scudder experienced three out of 362 sh ifts (0.8% of all daytim e shifts) where \nstaffing ratios were exactly on par with optimal levels at 1 : 8 or 1 : 8.3 (January 24, 2014 \nAM shift; January 27, 2014 AM shift; and June 19, 2014 PM Shift).  All other shifts were \nat better than optimal levels.  \n \n \t  Camp Munz experienced six out of 362 shifts (1.7% of all daytime shifts) where a shift’s \nstaff to m inor ratio slig htly exceeded the optimal 1 : 10 ratio and reached 1 : 10.6 \n(January 3, 2014 AM shift; January 18, 2014  AM and PM shifts; January 25, 2014 AM   \nand PM shifts; and January 26, 2014 AM shift).   \n \n \t  Camp Mendenhall experienced three out of 362  shifts (0.8% of all daytime shifts) where  \na shift’s staff to m inor ratio exce eded the op timal ratio of  1 : 10 and  supervision was \nprovided with 1 staff pe r 11 youth in th e camp (March 10, 2014 AM s hift; March 17, \n2014 PM shift; and March 21, 2014 AM shift).  All other shifts during the reporting \nperiod had better than optimal levels of staffing. \n \n \nFigure 15.1  \nAverage Day Time Staff-to-Minor Ratio (6:00 am to 2:00 pm Shift) \n6am ‐ 2pm  Shift \n14 \n12 \n10 \n8 \n6 \n4 \n2 \n0 \nOptimal  Ratio   State  Regulated  Limit  avg  min  max \n \n \n \n   \n12  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nStaffing Audits  \nTo confirm that staff-to-minor ratios are being met throughout the various shifts, the County also \ncontinues to conduct rando m, unannounced staffing aud its at all RTSB facili ties.  The staffing \naudits for this reporting period were conducted  during the day, night and weekend shifts.  In \norder to ensure that audits were conducted  evenly across all cam ps, a tracking system  was \ndesigned in October 2013 to ensure a m inimum of two (2) audits per camp were co nducted per \nmonth with one being a night or weekend audit. Of the 156 audits conducted during the reporting \nperiod, 87% of the unan nounced audits found that th e target ratios were m et at the tim e of the \naudit (refer to Figure 15.4).  Camps Munz and Miller had the lo west percentage of audits \nmeeting target ratios at 73% and 78%, respectively, with all other camps above 80%.  Any audits \nnot m eeting target ratios are referred to th e cam p manager to con ference with staff and \nimplement corrective action.  \n \nFigure 15.4  \nPercent of Audits Meeting Target Staffing Ratios (January – May 2014)  \nStaffing  Audits  (January ‐ May  2014)  \n%  of  Audits  Meeting  Target  Staffing  Ratios \n100% \n80% \n60% \n40% \n20% \n0% \n \n \nReview of Preliminary Incident Notifications  \nA total of 87 Preliminary Incident Notifications completed for events during the reporting period  \nresulting in a youth’s transport  out of the facility for m edical or psychiatric purposes were \nreviewed. Almost a third of the transports occurred during nighttime shifts.  All PINs reported  \nstaffing ratios bef ore and af ter th e transpo rt at optim al levels, de monstrating that RTSB \nmanagement’s efforts with th e issuance of the  Managing Workforce and Addressing Sta ffing  \nShortages Memorandum is effectively addressing staffing concerns during emergencies. \n \nPeace Officer Sign-In Log  \nDuring this rating period, the percentage of  staff who complied with s igning the Peace Officer \nSign-In Log was captured.  Based on 156 unannounced daytim e staffing audits,  90% of staf f \nsigned into the Peace Officer Sign-In Log (Figure 15.5).  Camp Jarvis h ad the lowest percent of \ncompliance at 80%, however, this was due to lo w percentages at the b eginning of the reporting \nperiod.  For the past several m onths the Camp  Jarvis staff have been in 100% com pliance  \n14  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \ndemonstrating that corrective measures employed after the last Self-Assessment were effective.   \nThis was generally the case for all other camps with percentages below 95 also.  \n \nFigure 15.5 \nPercent of Peace Officers Signed In (Average January through June Audits)  \nPeace  Officer  Sign‐In  Log  %  Signed‐In \n100% \n80% \n60% \n40% \n20% \n0% \n \n \n \nThe County Probation Departm ent will contin ue to  conduct staffing audits to ens ure that the \ntargeted staff-to-minor ratio are met.  In addition, the County will continue to review PINs and \nSCMs to ensure that camps are maintaining their staffing ratios at optimum levels.  \n \nDiscussion by Monitor:  \n \nAs has been previously noted, the last re vision of the Mem orandum of Agreem ent added \nlanguage to Provision #15 (Probation Staffing).  The gist of the  changes require the County to \nimprove its hiring and retention  practices for the Officers who work at the various cam ps.  The \nnew language also requires the County to regularly assess data concerning their levels of staffing \nat the camps.   \n \nThe County moved quickly to re-enforce their exis ting hiring practices in an effort to com ply  \nwith these new requirem ents.  The County’s self-assessment discussion well presents the steps \nthat have been taken in response to the new re quirements.  In addition, the County has provided  \nthe monitoring team with descriptive materials regarding the enhanced hiring practices including \nenhancements to performing background checks, reference checks and other pre-hire processes.   \nThe County has also su bmitted documentation that illustrates its progress in implementing the  \nchanges.  \n \nIn some ways the County’s effort in this area  extends beyond that which is often seen in the \nhiring process of similar juvenile justice agencies.  For example, the use of Live-Scan fingerprint \ntechnology, which has the capability of notifying the agency if an employee has had a potentially \nserious contact with law enforcement, is not generally in use by juvenile justice agencies.   \n15  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nWhile the County uses the L ive-Scan technology to  receive notifications  of law enforcem ent  \ncontact, it continues to put  a personal responsibility upon each  employee by requiring they self-\nreport any contact with a law enforcem ent agency.  It is noteworthy that the onus of personal   \nresponsibility for self-reporting continues to exist for the ag ency’s employees since many of the \ncomponents of the Probation Camps’ programming work to teach the residents of the camps the  \nneed to take personal responsibility for one’s own personal actions.  This is an important concept \nthat the monitoring team  appreciates and supports. \n \nDuring this m onitoring period the County comple ted the required step of “directly asking” \nemployees about contact with law enforcement.  The County reports that 4.13% of its Residential \nTreatment Services Bureau (RTSB; which is th e Probation Department’s Bureau that operates  \nthe camps) did not provide a response to the “d irectly ask” requirement.  While the County has \ncompleted the process for almost 96% of RTSB  employees, the County must also work to gain \nresponses from those employees who did not, for whatever reason, respond.    \n \nThe County’s improved hiring and retention practices  are an i mpressive and worthwhile effort  \nthat, by hiring the most capable and qualified staff possible, will have an impact beyond the life \nof this agreem ent.  Overall, the C ounty has b een diligent and aggressive in im plementing the \nnew requirements of Paragraph 15. \n \nThe County, the DOJ, and the Monitors agree that  the number of direct care staff needed to \nsafely operate a facility is  impacted by several factors, in cluding, for exam ple, the population \nbeing served by the facility, their social and offense histories, as well as the risk they represent to  \nthose persons who are around them.  The physical layout of the building or buildings, and the \nskill level and training of the staff also influence the kind of staffing pattern that is needed.   \n \nThe National Partnership for Juvenile Services  (NPJS), in its Position Statem ent on staffing, \nquoted the Office of Juvenile  Justice and Delinquency (OJJDP)  Conditions of Confinement:   \nJuvenile Detention and Corrections Facilities Report, which states: \n \n“One important element of security is staffing levels.  Without sufficient staff, juveniles are more \nlikely to be able to harm each other, staff, or  themselves.  In addition, lack of staff causes low \nstaff morale and higher levels of stress for staff.  When the staff to juvenile ratio exceeds national \nstandards, programming effectiveness will d iminish, which increases th e likelihood of physical \nintervention occurring.”1  \n \nThe California Corrections Standard Authority (C SA) mandates a ratio of one st aff for fifteen  \nresidents during waking hours in camp setting s in the State.  Originally, administrators for the \nCounty indicated they have set a goal of having a staff to minor ratio of one staff to ten residents \nat the camps during waking hours.  The ratio during sleeping hours is mandated to be one staff to \nthirty residents, however the m onitoring panel believes this ratio is insu fficient to assure safety  \nfor the minors at night. \n \n                                                 \n1 National Partnership  for Juvenile Services.  Position Statement:  Minimum Direct Care Staff Ratio in Juvenile \nDetention Centers.  October 25, 1998.  Page 1.  \n16  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nWith the closure of three of the CMYC camps in the Spring 2011, the County revised its staffing \nratios with its program  of sta ff reinvestment.  The staff reinvestm ent agreement set daytim e \nstaffing levels for Cam ps Rockey, Scott, Scudder, Onizuka, and the Dorot hy Kirby Center at a  \nratio of from 1:5 to 1:8 staff to wards.  At Camp McNair the ratio was set at 1:9, and at 1:10 for \nthe remaining camps. \n \nThe County has made significant progress in increasing the number of officers who are providing \ndirect supervision to the minors.  The County’s unannounced “staffing audits” have proven to be  \na positive step forward.  The unannounced audits  serve several purposes.  The audits prov ide  \nCounty management with point in time “snapshots” of information concerning potential staffing \nissues and also serve as a clear m essage to staff that the County is se rious about improving the \ndirect supervision of the minors at the camps.  Previously, the monitoring panel has encouraged a \nfaster dissemination of the com pleted audits.  W e are pleased to no te the tim eliness of the \ndistribution of the audits continues to be greatly improved. \n \nThe County’s Monthly Staffing Summaries track the numbers of full duty and limited duty staff \nwho are present during each shift.  Only full duty staff may be considered as provid ing direct \nsupervision of minors.  Light duty staff may perform other duties as assigned but are restricted in \ntheir ability to directly supervise juveniles.   \n \nUsing the Monthly Staffing Summ ary it is possibl e ascertain a clearer picture of the actual \nstaffing patterns of the camps.  The staffing summaries and the charts presented below represent \nonly the numbers of full-duty staff and minors at the camps and does not attempt to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the manner in which staff are deployed, the milieu of the camp or any of the \nother factors which come into p lay in a res idential facility.  The char ts do provide a num erical \ndepiction of the availability of  staff to prov ide supervision to the m inors.  Having adequate \nnumbers of staff is the f irst step in providing a safe and secure  environment and an effective \nprogram. \n \nTwo camps at the Challenger Memorial Center  are not included in th is depiction.   Camps  \nMcNair and Jarvis have each been split into two separate camps but with some shared resources.   \nThis sharing of resources makes it difficult to clearly depict their staffing in this f ormat; thus,  \nthey have b een omitted.  It is noted , however,  staffing at b oth Camps Jarvis and McNair a re \nconsistently within the  staffing ratios established by the C ounty.  The data presented below is \ntaken from the Monthly Staffing Summaries for the months of January through June 2014. \n \n   \n17  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

Such an  occurrence is often the result of an incident or \nthe need to provide transportation to, for example, a medical facility.  \n                                                 \n2 Undated memorandum issued in the Spring, 2011. \n21  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

The following chart  illustrates how often \nwaking hour shifts start with staffing levels that exceed the target ratio.  This information is also  \ntaken from the Monthly Staffing Summaries for each camp. \n \nPERCENTAGE OF WAKING HOUR SHIFTS STARTED  \nOVER TARGET RATIOS BY CAMP  \nJANUARY THROUGH JUNE 2014  \n \nCAMP NAME  NUMBER   OF  NUMBER OF    % OF SHIFT S   % OF SHIFTS \nSHIFTS   SHIFTS  STARTED  STARTED \nSTARTED  ABOVE  ABOVE \nABOUT  TARGET RATIO  TARGET \nTARGET RATIO  THIS PERIOD  RATIO  \nPREVIOUS \nMONITORING \nPERIOD \n         \nAFFLERBAUGH  362   11   3%  .5% \nPAIGE*  361   13   3.6%   1.4%  \nMENDENHALL  362   3  .08%   9.2%  \nMUNZ  362   7  1.9%   1.6%  \nGONZALES  362   0  0  0 \nKILPATRICK**  174   0  0  0 \nMILLER  362   0  0  0 \nSCUDDER 362  1  .3%  .3% \nROCKEY  362   0  0  .3% \nSCOTT  362   0  0  0 \nONIZUKA  362   0  0  3.5%  \nKIRBY  362   0  0  .3% \n \n* The afternoon/evening shift of May 10 at Camp Paige was not used to calculate the ratio due to  \na data entry error.  \n**Camp Kilpatrick was taken out of service March 28, 2014.  \n \nIt should be noted these figures  differ somewhat from the figures the County cited in their self-\nassessment.  At first glance this anomaly is mildly disconcerting.  However, in terms of the over-\nall picture, the differences are no t all th at significant.  Th e largest discrepancy is from  Camp \nPaige where the County noted five  waking hour shifts that were  out of com pliance with the \nmandated staffing ratio while the  monitoring team found 13 shifts  that were out of com pliance \nwith the mandated ratio.  Using the County’s figure, Camp Paige was out of compliance 1.4% of \nthe time; using the monitoring teams the figure rises to 3.6%.   \n \nAgain using the Ca mp Paige example, the Count y cited the following dates as being out of   \ncompliance:  January 17 A.M., January 31 A.M., Fe bruary 2 P.M., February 3 A.M., a fifth date \nwas not listed.  The monitoring team found that  Camp Paige exceeded the one to ten ratio 13   \ntimes during the monitoring period.  These occurred on the following dates: \n22  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

While the discrepancies between the  County’s calculations and those of the monitoring \nteam are noted, the ov erall impact of the discre pancy is m inimal.  At  most, the discrepancy \nresults in a small difference in the overall percentage of compliance with the mandated ratio for a \nfacility.  \n \nThe following is a listing of the other discrepancie s.  It appears that in som e cases the County \nlisted dates where a camp was exa ctly at the m andated ratio and, in other instances, in other \ninstances did not include the date s.  In at leas t one instance,  the wrong date was cited (Camp \nAfflerbaugh May 29 should have been May 28).  Some of the discrepancies may have been the \nresult of rounding numbers. \n \nCAMP AFFLERBAUGH: \n \nThe County listed six dates as non-com pliant.  They were January 17 A.M., February 24 A.M.,   \nApril 30 A.M., May 23 A.M., May 29 A.M. and June 5 A.M.  \nThe monitoring team found 11 instances of not m eeting the ratio.  They were January 17 A.M.,   \nFebruary 6 A.M., February 24 A.M., April 2 A.M., April 23 A.M., April 30 A.M., May 12 A.M.,  \nMay 23 A.M., May 28 A.M. and June 5 A.M.  \n \nCAMP PAIGE is discussed above.  \n \n   \n23  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

They were  March 10 A.M., March 17 A.M., \nand March 21 A.M. The monitoring team’s results matched those of the County. \n \nCAMP MUNZ:  \n \nThe County listed six dates as non-com pliant.   They were January 3 A.M., January 18 A.M., \nJanuary 18 P.M., January 25 A.M. and P.M. and  January 26 A.M.  The m onitoring team found \nthe same dates plus January 16 on the P.M. shift. \n \nCAMP SCUDDER:  \n \nThe County listed three dates as non-com pliant.  They were January 24 A.M., January 27 A.M., \nand June 19 P.M.  Two of the shifts listed we re at the m andated ratio.  The m onitoring team  \nfound only one shift to be non-compliant (January 27 A.M.).   \n \nClearly there are still o ccasions when the m andated ratios are no t met and the C ounty should \ncontinue to work to correct such shortages wh en they occu r.  The m onitoring team notes the \nsignificant improvements that have been made in meeting the mandated ratios.  The most notable  \nimprovement came at Camp Mendenhall.  Both the County and the monitoring team agree Camp  \nMendenhall met the mandated ratio during this  reporting period 99.2% of the tim e.  During the \nprevious monitoring period (July  1-December 31, 2013) the com pliance level was a troub ling  \n90.8% of the time.  The County administration and the staff and leadership at Camp Mendenhall \nare to be congratulated on the improvement. \n \nOccurrences of starting a shift with an insufficient staffing ratio should be rare or better yet non-\nexistent.  During the previous monitoring period the County developed and distributed specific \ninstructions to camp administrators and supervisors specific directions regarding the amelioration  \nof staffing shortages.  When followed, the instructions have the potential to help ameliorate the \nstaffing shortage situation.  This may be one of the reasons for the continued improvement in the \nlevels of staffing at the cam ps.  Even with  the general improvement in staffing at the cam ps,  \nthere are still instances where the number of officers providing direct supervision to the minors is \nproblematic.  It is noted that the number of incidents that o ccurred while staffing is short does \nseem to have lessened.  The following examples occurred during this monitoring period:   \n \n   On February 9, 2014 at approximately 6:48 P.M. there was a physical altercation between \ntwo minors in Dormitory A/B at Ca mp Onizuka that resulted in an eye injury  to one of  \nthe minors.  At the tim e of the inc ident three staff were superv ising 25 m inors.  The \nmandated staffing ratio at Camp Onizuka is one staff to six minors. \n   On March 6, 2014 at approximately 3:30 P.M. in Dormitory A/B at Camp Onizuka there \nwas an incident of alleged m arijuana smoking by a minor.  At the time of the incident \nfour staff were supervising 26 m inors.  The mandated staffing ratio at Ca mp Onizuka is \none staff to six minors. \n24  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \t  On March 15, 2014 at approxim ately 2:50 P.M. on the outdoor recreation area at C amp  \nMunz there was an incident where a minor was injured while engaging in horseplay.  The \nminor suffered a possible disloc ated shoulder or fracture.   At the tim e of the incident \nthree staff were supervising 34 minors.  The mandated staffing ratio at Camp Munz is one  \nstaff to ten minors. \n\t   On April 2, 2014 at approxim ately 8:10 P.M. in Dormitory A/B at Camp Onizuka there \nwas an incident involving five m inors.  The  incident appeared to have been racially \nmotivated.  At the time of  the inc ident four staff were superv ising 25  minors.  The \nmandated staffing ratio at Camp Onizuka is one staff to six minors. \n \t  On April 19, 2014 at approxim ately 9:15 A.M. in the dormitory at Camp Afflerbaugh a \nminor allegedly assaulted a sta ff member during head calls.  At the time of the incident \nsix staff were providing supervision in th e dormitory to 63 m inors.  The m andated \nstaffing ratio for Camp Afflerbaugh is one staff to six minors.  Following the incident the  \nminor was transpo rted to a Spec ial Housing  Unit.  This  left the c amp with a tota l \npopulation of 75 minors with only seven full duty staff on-duty.   \n \nIt is recognized and acknowledged that in juvenile facilities incidents can and do occur even with \nappropriate staffing.  However, having an appropriate number of staff supervising and engaging \nminors in their  daily a ctivities can significantly reduce incidents of y outh-on-youth assaults, \nfights and other kinds o f negative behaviors.   Adequate staffing also supports the facilities’ \nefforts to implement rehabilitative programming.   \n \nWhile overnight staffing has continued to ge nerally im prove within the cam p system , the \nmonitoring panel’s previously noted concerns about over-night coverage remains in some camps  \nparticularly the large r camps such as Cam ps Afflerbaugh, Mendenhall,  Paige and Munz.  A s  \nnoted above, the California Standard s Authority mandates there be a ratio of one staff to thirty \nminors during sleeping hours and all the cam ps surpass the CSA’s requirement.  However, with \nthe current camps’ open dorm settings (at som e camps upwards to 75 m inors sleep in an open \nbarracks style building) the Monito rs continue to conside r this to be a n inadequate staf fing  \nmodel.  The National Partnership for Juvenile Services recommends a one staff to sixteen minors  \nratio during sleeping hours. \n \nOver-night camp safety and security concerns  arise primarily from of a com bination of two \nfactors: staffing levels and the open dorm  setting.  As noted earlier, staffing ratio of one staff to \nthirty minors concerns the monitoring panel and we are pleased to note the sleeping hour ratios   \nare generally m uch bet ter than the m andated  ratio.  The m onitoring team’s concern about \nnighttime staffing is because most of the camps have “open bay” dorms where dozens of minors \nroom together, have the ability to possibly overw helm a small number of staff or other m inors,  \nand are can move around the facility (primarily to use the restroom) under minimal supervision.  \n \nThe County notes most daytime staff assigned to the camps do sleep over at the facilities, and are  \navailable to provide assistance to the night staff in the event of an incident.  Each camp generally \nhas between 8 and 10, and sometimes more, staff sleeping over-night at the facilities.  During the \nsleeping hours, these staff are not actively supervis ing the residents, but are expected to respond \n25  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nshould an incident occur.  The officers, who have generally worked a full shift of 16 hours, are \nthen “on-call” during their eight-hour sleep period as first responders in the event of an incident.   \nWhile this arrangem ent is illust rative of the challenging nature  of the work, it is an unusual   \nstaffing pattern in a juvenile justice setting.  \n \nThe monitoring team continues to be pleased with the improvement in the numbers of staff who \nare providing supervision to the m inors during  the sleeping hours.  It is incum bent upon the \nCounty to work to assure that both m inors and staff are safe during the overnight hours.  W hile \nmany camps’ nighttime staffing ratios are now within generally accepted professional standards, \nduring this monitoring period a  few camps had occasions  when nighttim e staffing was higher \nthan generally accepted standards.  For example: \n \n   On February 3 the overnight staffing rati o at Ca mp Paige was one staff to 24.67 \nminors. \n   On February 7 the overnight staffing ratio  at Ca mp Munz was one s taff to 23.67 \nminors. \n   On March 1 the overnight staffing ratio  at Camp Afflerbaugh was one staff to 24.67 \nminors. \n   On April 13 the overnight staffing ratio at Camp Munz was one staff to 25.33 minors. \n   On April 18 the overnight staffing ratio  at Camp Afflerbaugh was one staff to 38 \nminors. \n   On both May 30 and May 31 the overnight staffing ratio at Camp Munz was one staff \nto 25 minors. \n   On June 1 the overnight staffing ratio at Camp Munz was one staff to 25 minors. \n   On June 28 the overnight staffing ratio at Camp Rockey was one staff to 26.5 minors. \n \nThe monitoring team notes most of these examples are from larger facilities.  We further note the \naverage ratios for these facilities are lower.  We encourage the County to carefully monitor the \nlevel of nighttime staffing to assure it does not trend upward. \n \nAs noted previously, officers continue to have a variety of duties  that may take them away from  \nproviding direct supervision of the main body of minors.  These duties can include activities such \nas m anning control centers, writing reports  or gathering other kinds of doc umentation, \nconducting orientation of new re sidents, providing off-campus transportation for m inors, \nproviding supervision or guidance for campus visitors, or a number of other legitimate activities.   \nWhile such activities are necess ary, they do take  away from the officers’ ab ility to directly \nsupervise the minors under their care, which should always be their first priority, and may reduce \nthat direct supervision of those minors to an unacceptable level.  \n  \nDuring interviews, the line staff at the camps  often comment that while they support the \nincreased direct supervision of the m inors, they also note that it has becom e more difficult for \nthem to do their assigned casework.  This comment is supported in both interviews with minors \nand in many of the grievances filed by the m inors.  The juveniles note that with more officers   \nproviding supervision of necessary m ovements, dorm  supervision and other youth related \nactivities, it is increasingly difficult for the minors to meet with their respective caseworkers.   \n \n26  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nIn reviewing various incident reports, it is clear that many of  the camps are sometimes operating \nwith staffing patterns that could result in a limited ability to meet the various contingencies that  \noccur during the normal operation of a cam p.  As illustrated above, there are tim es when staff \nmust provide transportation off ca mpus to a  Special Handling Unit (SHU) or to a m edical \nfacility.  The Probation Departm ent always a ssigns two officers to transport a m inor who \nrequires such care.  This is a routine and appropriate safety precaution at many juvenile facilities.   \nHowever, if two of ficers are involved in tr ansporting a m inor to another lo cation, this may \nreduce the ability of the rem aining officers to  provide adequate direct supervision of the \nremaining juveniles, or may impact the minors’ ability to participate in the mandated treatment \nactivities that are scheduled to occur.  \n \nIn simple terms, if a camp starts the day with eight full duty officers and 70 m inors on site they \nwould be compliant with the m andated ratio at  a camp where the ratio has been establish ed at \none officer to ten minors.  However, if staff must be taken offline to perform a medical transport \nor some other neces sary work the staff to m inor ratio and safety stand ards are co mpromised.  \nThis is a frequent topic of conversation am ong officers, supervisors and adm inistrators at the \ncamps. \n \nProbation Department administrators have said  that camp directors and supervisors have the \ncapability of hiring additional staff by use of overtime, or can bring in additional staff from other \ncamps to compensate for any staff shortages;. H owever, this has sometimes not been evident in \npractice.  During the previous monitoring period the County issued specific instructions to staff \nto assist them in dealing with staf fing shortages as they arise.  This appears to have  helped the \ncamps maintain generally acceptable staffing in the camps. \n \nThe challenge and requirements of this provision continue to be threefold:   \n \n•  \t   First, to assure that an adequate number of officers are on duty at all times.  \n• \t    Second, to assure that on-duty officers’ provide a safe environment in which the camp’s  \n      rehabilitative programs can be carried out.                  \n•\t   Third, to implem ent a nd m aintain the ne w requirem ents for background checks on \nprospective employees and a system to periodically re-check the status of current employees  \nincluding a periodic m echanism by which th e County directly asks employees who have \ndirect contact with minors about prior criminal misconduct during interviews and reviews. \n \nThe County’s continued em phasis on providing fo r the safety of both m inors and staff as   \nevidenced by staffing increases is both comm endable and necessary.  T he County has devoted \nresources and effort into this critical part of  the agreement.  The monitoring panel was pleased to  \nsupport the County’s request that  Provision 15 be m oved into compliance monitoring effective \nNovember 1, 2013.   \n \nRecommendations: \n• \t The County should continue its efforts to preserve and strengthen the improvement it has       \nmade in the number of officers who are providing direct supervision to the minors at the \ncamps   within the agreed upon staffing ratios.  The County should work to assure that   \noccurrences of inadequate staff to youth ratios are reduced or eliminated. \n27  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n• \t  The County should continue its  efforts to merge direct supervision activities with those \nactivities and programs that ar e intended to  provide rehabilitative services. The first \npriority should be to as sure the sup ervision and safety of minors.  Successf ul juvenile \njustice p rograms place a heavy  em phasis on rehab ilitative pro gramming while   \nmaintaining a safe milieu for both residents and staff.  \n• \t  The County should review its overnight direct  supervision operations within the camp \nsystem in order increase and/or maintain the amount of nighttime supervision to minors \navailable during the sleeping hours. \n \n• \t  The County should continue its effort to  perfor m both self-evaluation and quality   \nassurance.  The County should continue to devote resources to performing unannounced \nstaffing audits. \n \n• \t  The County should continue to implem ent the newest requirem ents of Provision 15 \nregarding background checks for prospective employees and periodic background checks \non existing em ployees.  The County has imp lemented a pro tocol that m eets the  \nrequirement in the provision that the Count y shall directly ask  applicants for, and \nemployees in, positions that result in co ntact with youth about  contact with law \nenforcement.  The County should work to  assure that employees who return f rom \napproved leave com plete the law enforcem ent contact verification upo n their retu rn to \nwork.  Additionally, the County should obtai n the requ ired verifications from the \nremaining 4.13% of RTSB e mployees who did not subm it the law enforcem ent contact \nreporting forms. \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n• \t A monitoring team member reviewed the status of this paragraph while on site at Camps \nPaige, Rockey and Afflerbaugh April 8-10. \n• \t  Monitoring team  members regularly review various incident reports, internal monitoring reports, \ninternal staffing reports, various statis tical reports and other do cumentation provided by  the \nCounty.   \n• \t  Monitoring team members routinely participate in  conference calls dealing  with general and \nspecific program issues.  \n \n \nParagraph 17: Rehabilitation and Behavior Management  \n \nRehabilitation:  The County shall provide adequate  rehabilitative and gender-specific \nprogramming, as necessary.  The County shall continue to conduct appropriate individualized \nassessments by qualified staff. \n \nThe County shall develop and provide integrated treatment services that meet the rehabilitative  \nneeds of youth at all Probation Camps.  These services shall adequately: address youth ’s \neducational needs (including acces s to special education services); provide access to medical \nand mental health services, in cluding substance abuse treatment; provide a structured living \nenvironment that facilitates, reinforces, and  provides opportunities for youth to practice pro -\n28  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

This multidisciplinary assessment shall consider the Camps  \nAssessment Unit’s (“CAU’s”) assessmen t of the  youth.  Based on this multidisc iplinary \nassessment, the County shall formulate a  comprehensive service plan, including case plan \ngoals for rehabilitation and treatment, for each youth. \n \nThe County shall ens ure that ea ch Camp o ffers the  necessary  re habilitative trea tment, \nprograms, and services to mee t the needs of y outh housed there, co nsistent with safety an d \nsecurity needs, based o n the assessments and treatment plans.  Such offer ings shall include,  \nbut shall n ot be limited to, grou p therapy or  individu al counseling for each youth, as   \nnecessary.  \n \nAt Camps providing an adapted Dialectical Behavior Therapy (“DBT”) program, the County \nshall create a detailed program description for the DBT program to include, but not be limited  \nto, the purpose; goals; desired  results; target populations; expectations for staff training and \nprogram delivery; and type, intensity, and duration of services to be provided. \n \nThe County shall ensu re that ex isting staff demonstrate competency, and new staff receive \nsufficient competency-based training, to fully implement the rehabilitative interventions.  \n \nThe County shall ensure that each rehabilita tive treatment, program,  and service at each   \nCamp offers sufficient capacity to allow youth who need the treatment, program, or service to  \nparticipate in it.  The County shall ensure that  youth attend their prescribed programs, as \noutlined in their   treatment plans.  The youth’s caseworker shall regularly report to th e  \nyouth’s treatment team and docum ent the youth’s progress in meetin g his or her case plan   \ngoals.  Youth who are not meeting their case  plan goals shall receiv e prompt subsequent, \nindividualized assessments and follow-up. \n \nThe County shall ensure that its rehabilitation and intervention programs continue to address \nyouth’s needs related to peer pressure and gang affiliation. \n \nBehavior Management:   The County shall provide a fac ility-wide behavio r manageme nt \nsystem that is imp lemented throughout the day,  including during school time.  The behavior \nmanagement system shall encoura ge meaningful rewards for positiv e behavior.  Discip line  \nand sanctions shall no t be arb itrary.  The County shall continue to develop  the behavio r  \nmanagement program in consultation with the Monitoring Team.  \nThe County shall implemen t th e behavior  ma nagement system in accordance with th e  \nfollowing schedule and based on the effective date of this Amendment: \n \n29  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nWithin 30 days, the County shall comp lete   detailed, written guidance for its behavio r  \nmanagement system.  \n \nWithin 60 days, the County shall provide staff with competency-based training on the behavior \nmanagement system.  \n \nWithin 60 days, the County shall intr oduce th e behavior management system to youth ,  \nincluding by providing youth with orientat ion and written guidance on the system and \ninitiating the system in all Probation Camps.  The written guidance shall be made available to  \nyouth in the dorm and at orientation thereafter. \nThe County shall ensure that its behavior ma nagement system includes specific, consistent  \nrequirements and behavioral expectations for  each part o f the day d uring which youth can  \nearn points.  The County shall ensure that each  segment of each day is consistently rated for  \nall youth, every day, in every Probation Camp. \n \nThe County shall provide a co mprehensive array of short- and long-term incentives at each \nProbation Camp and shall ensur e that you th have access to all rewards and privileges to \nwhich they are entitled.  The ability to purchase items fro m a store on a weekly basis may b e  \npart of this array, but it shall not be the only incentive offered. \n \nThe Count y shall use a continuum of individu alized consequences in response to non -\ncompliant behavior or rule violations at each  Probation Camp.  The County shall ensure that \nisolation may be used only as a  last resort on this continuum, and only in response to violent \nor aggressive behavior; to prev ent violent or aggressive or  criminal behavior, including \nextreme and chronic disruptive behavior; or for the minor’s own protection. \n \nThe County, with input from the Monitors, shall draft and implement a policy that enumerates  \nthe t ypes of  be haviors t hat c ould r esult i n   a refe rral to isola tion   and requires detailed \njustification for sending a youth to isolation, maintaining the youth in isolation, and removing \nthe youth from isolation.  \n \nThe County shall ensure that the p eriod of isolation is based on the youth’s behavior, or the \nthreat to the youth, rather than on a pre-dete rmined period.

Higher com pletion rates (Table 17-2) appear to have im pacted posttest scores. \nMoral Reasoning groups showed a significant le vel of improvem ent with 86% of the youth \nshowing a decrease in cognitive distortions after completing Moral Reasoning; these results are  \nbased on the comparison of the pre and post scores of the How I Think Questionnaire. According \nto the results of posttest for the Skills Streaming Checklist, 58% of youth showed an increase in \npro-social skill usage after com pleting Skill Streaming. According to the re sults of post-test for \nthe Aggression Questionnaire, 60% of youth showed a decrease in  aggressive responses, and an \nincrease in ability to channel those responses in a safe and constructive manner after completing \nAnger Control. The overall findings suggest that yout h are continuing to use pro-social skills at \nhigher rates and are employing more m ature and constructive thought  processes after group \nparticipation.    \n \n   \n31  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

The Central Region mainta ins fairly low and \nconstant rates.  The West Region’s rate is significantly lower than other camps for most of the \nreporting period; however due to th e lower  population numbers in the region a f ew YOYV \nincidents can dramatically affect the rate as seen in June.  \n \nFigure 17-1  \nYouth on Youth Violence Rates in ART Camps  \nART Camps:  Average YOYV Rate by  Region \nh  30 \nt\nu\no\nY 25 \n0 \n0\n1 20 \nr \ne\np\ne  15 \nat\nR 10 \nV \nY\nO 5 \nY\n g. \nv 0 \nA\nEast  Region  West  Region  Central  Region  North  Region \n \nNote:\t   Rate = (Number of YOYV Incidents per Regional ART Camps / Average Population) * 100 \n  East Region = Paige and Afflerbaugh \n  West Region = Miller and Gonzales  \n  Central Region = Munz  and Mendenhall \n  North Region = McNair and Jarvis  \n \n \nThe fluctuation in the rates of violence in  the ART cam ps East Region m ay be of concern. \nFigure  17-1 above shows greater variability in YOYV rates from month to month; Camp Paige’s \nYOYV rates are fairly constant which reduced the even g reater fluctuations presented by Camp  \nAfflerbaugh.

County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nfurther assessment. The source of the problem has not been determined and may be attributed to \nvarious factors from youth not participating in ART to the underlying camp culture. \n \nFigure 17-2 and Figure 17-3 below are control charts commonly used in qua lity assurance to  \ndetermine whether there is any significance to changes in key performance measures, YOYV and \nYouth on Staff Violence (YOSV), or if they are due to norm al variation.

The control limits embody the range between which all points \nare expected to fall if rates  are in statistical control.  It can  be determined that the num ber of \nviolent incidents in May (YOYV)  and March (YOSV) are not due  to normal variation and the \nsource of the problem needs to  be identified to bring the ra tes back under control.  The \nDepartment will focus resources on Ca mp Afflerbaugh during the next reporting period to   \nidentify the source of the problem and reduce the presenting risks through corrective action.  \n \nFigure 17-2  \nYouth on Youth Violence Rates in Camp Afflerbaugh \nYOUTH-ON-YOUTH VIOLENCE RATES 2014 \n35 \nh \nt\nou 30 \ny\n 0  25 \n0\n1\ner  20 \np\nV \nY 15 \nO\nY\n f  10 \no\ne \nat 5 \nR\n0 \n \n \n   \n33  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

DMH and Probation have continued to pilot a \nmeasure to standard ize the obser vation of groups by supervisory  staff.  The purpose of this \nmeasure is to enhance the supervision provide d to clinicians conducting Adapted DBT groups .  \nThe measure continues to be piloted throughout the Adapted DBT camps.     \n \nThe audit tool introduced in December 2013 captures release cohort data for youth participating  \nin the program. Over the course of the monitoring period, improvements have been made to the \naudit tool and training provided to the auditors to ensure consistency in  the reporting of numbers.  \nIn May it was discovered through discussion with  Camp Rockey Management that documented \nrates of successful completion have been negatively impacted by the inclusion of youth who had \ntransferred from other facilities with minimal confinement time remaining.  Therefore, the tim e  \nspent in the camp was not long enough for the youth to complete their programs. This factor will \nbe explored during the next m onitoring period to determ ine the  extent of i mpact on all DBT \ncamps.  Auditors have been instructed to doc ument on the audit tool the reason for a youth’s \nfailure to successfully complete the program.         \n \n   \n34  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

DBT was \ndesigned to address treatm ent barriers presented by clien tele with a history of self-harm ing \nbehavior and/or co-occurring disorders.  Therefore, youth at risk of self-i njurious behavior are \nplaced in DBT camps, and it is anticipated that their rates would be higher than that of the ART \ncamps. \n \nAs with the last reporting period, DBT Camps have maintained very low rates of self-injurious \nbehavior with DKC at 4 incidents per 100 youth and camps Onizuka, Scott, Scudder and Rockey \naveraging less than 1 in cident per 100 youth (see  Table 17.4).   Although Camps Jarvis and \nMendenhall are not D BT Camps, their rates aver aged 1 and 1.33 incident s of self-injurious \nbehavior per 100 youth, respectively.  As is discussed in the  Referrals to SHU section of this  \nreport, Jarvis is having  difficulties in other a reas and will be f urther assessed to  determine \nwhether the issue stems from their higher concentration of youth with  psychotropic medication \nneeds.  Camp McNair has a similar population, however, experienced no self-injurious behavior \nincidents during the reporting pe riod.  Although the rate of in cidents at Camp Mendenhall are \nslightly higher than other ART camps they remain very low overall. Self-injurious behavior may \nbe related to anger m anagement issues as we ll.  Circum stances beyond RTSB’s control can \nchange the findings of an initial Multi-Disciplinary Assessment. A Multi-Disciplinary Team will \nconvene as-needed to reassess a minor’s suitab ility for their current program  based on the \ndiscovery of new behavior.  Camp Mendenhall’s rates will be monitored and assessed during the \nnext reporting period. \n \n   \n35  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

It  consists of, daily  observing and  \ngrading of youths behavior; re warding desired behavior; sanc tioning undesired behavior; and \nprogressing through the program .  BMP is a strong tool that encour ages all youth to com plete \ntheir program via incentives for compliance with facility rules, while gaining critical knowledge \nrelated to the effects of positive and negative behavior that should lead to improved outcomes for \nyouth once they are released to the comm unity.  The most valuable privilege earned through the \nBMP for most youth is earning consideration for early release.   \n \nThe BMP components of Daily Merit Ladders (DMLs), Point Mechanics, Daily Rewards, Stage \nPromotions, and the use of Sanction For ms were identified as areas for monitoring to enhance   \nBMP effectiveness. Pro bation staff has been  fully trained in BMP implementation. Additional \ndaily checks and balances ha ve been put in place by R TSB m anagement March 2014 to \nstandardize and sim plify the calculation of point s and the youth’s status in the BMP.   This  \nchange resulted in the newly designed Made  Day Tracking Log which replaces the DML.   The  \nMade Day Tracking  Log resu lts in the c amps ability to more accurately document, track, and  \nreport the status of youths’ stages and eligibility for promotion.  This enhanced process resulted \nin Stage Prom otions across the board being gr anted in a tim ely manner.  There has been a \nsignificant improvement in auditing in this area  since the last Monitoring Period, which will be \ndiscussed in further detail below.  \n \n36  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nThe BMP audit tool was modified in February 2014 to define what findings “Meet Expectations” \nor conversely requires corrective action. It is departmental standards that points, including school \npoints, are being added properl y; Sanctions are being releva ntly assigned, completed, and \nreviewed b y a Supervisor; Daily  Rewards ar e being given appropri ately, an d that Stag e \nPromotions are occurring timely, which is within one (1) w eek of eligibility.  In order to “Meet \nExpectations”, camps are expected  to perform at  80% or better; with no m ore than 20% rote \nscoring of 1s and 0s as well as no more than  20% of the youth receiv ing a reward when not \nearned is met.  Camps or f acilities that f all below the “Meets Expe ctations” threshold are \nrequired to develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) as to what steps will be taken to achieve the  \nrequired performance level.  These CAPs are  followed-up by DOJ/QA Supervisors to ensure \ncompliance is achieved.  \n \nThese established perf ormance expectations  allow the County to track progress and the \neffectiveness of corrective actions .   Figure 17-4   below provides an overview of BMP \nperformance measures and indicates when expectations were not met during the quarter.    \n \nFigure 17-4:  March through May Performance Expectations Not Met \nSchool  DML Point  Daily  Stage \nCamp  Points   Mechanics   Sanctions   Rewards   Promotions \n       \nar pr y  ar pr ay ar pr ay ar pr ay ar pr ay\n   M A Ma M A M M A M M A M M A M\nEAST \n                             \n                             \nREGION: \nAfflerbaugh                              \nPaige                               \nRockey                               \nWEST \nREGION:                               \nDorothy Kirby \nCenter                              \nMiller                                \nGonzales                                \nCENTRAL \nREGION:                               \nScott                               \nScudder                                \nMunz                               \nMendenhall                               \nNORTH \nREGION:                               \nOnizuka                              \n37  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

The c amp staff  has been consistently including the points on the  \nDaily Merit Ladders with an occasional calculation error. However, all camps meet expectations \nin this area for February through May 2014. \n \nDaily Merit Ladder Point Mechanics  \nThe camps have been meeting expectations regarding rote grading with 0s, 1s and 2s.  The use of \nrote 0s and 1s are always isolated incidents.  The reason for the rote grade is usually documented \nat the bottom of the grading period’s column indicating the behavior exhibited by all youth in the \ngroup.  During February through May 2014, all camps met expectations in this area. There was \nonly one occurrence (January) w here rote grades resulted in Camp Onizuka not m eeting \nexpectations. This was an isolate occurren ce which warranted all disciplinary rem ovals receive \n“1” point due to a camp disturbance. \n     \nThe audit tool was modified in April for the March audits to include  a question regarding the \nappropriateness of grades for youth not housed w ith the general population (i.e. youth housed in \nSHU, Infirmary, SSPs, or Youth on Trans).  With the exception of camp Jarvis in the Month of \nMay, all camps m et expectations in this area.   Camp Jarvis did not consistently docum ent and \nadd points for m inors housed in the SHU.  As  the Challenger SHU s taff also record youth’s \npoints on a DML, the corrective action entailed the respective camp staff, which would normally \nbe responsible for the youth, contacting the SHU for an update on points.   \n \nDaily Rewards  \nA majority of the camps have maintained compliance with rewarding deserving youth and not \nrewarding youth who have been disqualified or did not meet the point requirements.  In January, \n69% of the cam ps met expectations according to  current standards with four cam ps (McNair,  \nMunz, Onizuka  and Scudder) failing to meet expectations.  In April and May, 85% of the camps  \n“Met Expectations.”  Camp McNair failed to meet expectations in January due to three out of 24 \nyouth receiving a reward for which they did not qua lify.  The issue at Ca mp Munz in January \nwas a result of two out of 13 m inors receiving a reward w hen they did not qualif y.  At Camp \nOnizuka in January, five youth qualified to receive  a reward, but did not sign off as receiving the \nreward.  It was later noted that  this occurrence was due  to the referral of the five youth to the \nSHU prior to the issuance of rewards.  Therefore, the five youth actually no longer qualified. The \nsample population of youth who do not earn a reward can be so small that just one or two minors  \nwho receive a reward when they should not have cause inflated percentages as was the case with \nCamps Scudder in January.  Furthermore, becau se a youth can be disqu alified after rewards are \ndispersed, creating the false impression that they received a reward that they had not earned, the \nsmall population size was considered an isolated incident and corrective action was not required.  \n   \n38  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nTable 17.5 increases the sam ple size by including  January through May totals of youth who \nreceived unearned rewards and shows that the five m onth average in all camps would have met  \nthe 80% threshold.   Currently, trends in regard  to m eeting expectations in the Daily Reward \nsection are positive as reflected in Table  17.5. \n \nTable 17-5   \nUse of Sanctions; Completions & Unearned Rewards            \nCamp   Average #  % of  # Youth  % Youth \nSanctions   Sanctions   Unearned  Unearned \n Per  100  Completed  Rewards   Rewards  \nYouth        Received \nJarvis 15  86%  19%  10%   \nMcNair 12  100%   8%  4%   \nOnizuka 19    97%  7  17%     \nNorth Region \nAverage  15  94%  11  10% \n \nMunz  4  100%   15  17% \nMendenhall  8  96%  20  8% \nScudder 24  99%  3  7% \nScott  9  99%  22  0% \nCentral Region \nAverage  11  99%  15  8% \n \nMiller 11  97%  19  0% \nGonzalez 9  75%  7  0% \nDKC 8  75%  7  0%  \nWest Region  \nAverage 8  57%  16  8%   \n \nRockey 35  96%  15  0% \nPaige 60  98%  13  2% \nAfflerbaugh 19  88%  26  7% \nEast Region  \nAverage 38  94%  18  3%   \n \nNote: Rate = (Average Number of Sanctions Jan.-May. / Average Population) * 100 \n    (Average Number of Sanctions Accompanied by Zero Point Jan.- May. / Average \nNumber of Sanctions) * 100   \n \n39 \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nSanctions  \nThe Behavior Management Program implemented the use of sanctions for youth who engage in \nrule violations. Sanctions serve as a learning tool and an altern ative to removing the youth from \nthe general camp population. Sanctions can range fr om a written assignm ent to a privilege or \nstage drop, and/or the loss of a  daily reward. S anctions are prim arily used when the behavior \ndoes not justify sending a youth to the Special Ha ndling Unit (SHU) for temporary isolation and \nthe youth is not an immediate danger to self and others.   \n \nIn February, the audit tool was m odified to calculate the total number of sanctions for the entire \naudit month in relation to the number of sanctions that were signed off by a supervisor as having \nbeen completed.  All cam ps met expectations in this reg ard except for Cam p Gonzales in  \nFebruary, Camp Afflerbaugh in March, and Camp Jarvis in May.  The audits revealed that Camp  \nGonzales was using the old version of the Sanction Form , which did not have a Supervisor \nverification signature line.  This was corrected in the latter m onths of the m onitoring period.  \nCamp Jarvis also used the old Sanction Form on 3 occasions and 4 youth refused to complete the \nwriting assignment.    Furthermore, clarity on the wording of the audit tool questions became an \nissue as auditors did not consis tently check for written ass ignments, only supervisor signatures,  \nto verify that a sanction was completed.  As of April, the auditors were instructed to check f or  \nwriting assignments (when applicable) to ens ure that the sanctions were in f act verified as  \ncompleted. Similarly, during the next m onitoring  period, staff will look for an indicator on  the \nform that privilege suspension, work duty susp ension, work detail and phase dem otions were \napplied as indicated on the Sanction For m.  Ca mp staffs have also been encouraged to be \nmindful of the relevancy of writing assignments in connection with the behavior.  This gives the  \nyouth an opportunity to reflect on alternative  socially acceptable behaviors and ensure they \nunderstand the consequences for such negative behavior.  Table 17-6 below gives an overview of \nSanction usage across the camps.  It appears that some camps may benefit from increasing their  \nuse of Sanctions with the youth to enhance rehabilitative efforts and pro-social skills (i.e. Camps  \nMunz and Mendenhall). \n \nTable 17-6  \nUse of Sanction Totals and Rates (January through May) \n \nCamp  February  March  April  May \n  total / rate   total / rate   total / rate   total / rate  \n  per population  per population  per population  per population \n   \nNorth Region \n  Jarvis  5   /   8%  23 /  33%  19 /  26%  12 /  17% \n  McNair  7   /   10%  20 /  28%  11 /  16%  9  / 12% \nOnizuka  21  /   43%  17 /  31%  19 /  37%  17 /  33% \nCentral Region \n  Munz  3   /   4%  1  / 1%  4  /  6%  10  / 14% \n  Mendenhall  1   / 2%  6  / 1%  17  / 3%  9  / 2% \n40  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

In addition, Made \nDays are tracked in order to m onitor the youth’s progress toward an early release consideration. \nA youth will obtain a Made Day when a point threshold is achieved, along with the avoidance of \na Special Incident Report and/or school referral on a given day.  \n \nPreviously, documentation in regard to stage  promotions was inaccurate on the Daily Merit \nLadders due to lack of comm unication and training of the P robation night staff who tallied and \ncalculated consecutive made day totals. According to the DML’s in March, it was discovered the  \ncamps not meeting expectations; were in fact pr omoting youth in the allotted tim e frame. This \ninformation was found on the Made Day Tracker.  A RTSB process enhancem ent resulted in the \ndevelopment of the Made Day Tracker, which allows the BMP Coordinators to more easily track \nyouth’s stage promotions. All camps with the ex ception of Dorothy Kirby Center, with whom   \nunique monitoring tools were developed due to th eir tracking differences, are now utilizing the \nMade Day Tracker.  As corrective action had been issued to camps not meeting expectations in \nMarch, the night staffs in m any of these cam ps were trained and were com ing on board with \ncalculating consecutive m ade days accurately  on  the DML.  Therefore, when th e DMLs and \nMade Day Trackers were com pared, the outcomes were found to be in com pliance in the April \nand May audits.  Stage promotions are now being audited against the Made Day Tracker rather \nthan the DML, which resulted in a shift to all camps meeting expectations in April and May.   \n \nSPECIAL HANDLING UNIT  \n \nPurpose of the Special Handling Unit (SHU)  \nThe SHU is designed to remove youth from the general population due to health and/or safety \nreasons. The placement in SHU is deemed necessary when a youth commits a Major Rule \nViolation or due to health and/or safety reasons.  SHU should only be utilized for the time \n41  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nnecessary to adjust behavior.  Major Rule Violations are categorized according to the following \ndescriptors for tracking purposes: \n   Fights or “near fights”        \n   Gang activity \n   Repetitious acts of failing to follow instructions (“FFI/Rep Acts”)  \n   Assaults on staff or minor(s) \n   Late night disturbance \n   Being out of bounds/supervision or absent without leave (“OOB/AWOL”)  \n   Possession of contraband (i.e. items that can be used as weapons, drug paraphernalia) \n   School Disturbance/Refusal \n   Sexual Misconduct \n   Theft \nDuring a youths SHU stay, a complete assessment of “Readiness for Release” is to be conducted  \nevery shift by a supervisor and appropriately state the youth’s current condition and if applicable,   \njustification as to why they are to remain in the SHU past the assessment.  \nYouth’s stay in the SHU is not entirely in isolation.  Where deemed safe and appropriate, youth  \ncontinue to participate in school, meals and recreation or full body exercise.  \n \nRate of SHU Referrals   \nReferrals to SHU as recorded in the SHU Log Database are improving in many aspects.  The rate  \nof referral to the SHU, as seen in  Table 17-7  depends upon the type of youth housed at the   \nfacility, the population size, style of the facility, and the location of the facility to the SHU.    \n \nDorothy Kirby Center has the lowest referral rate , 6 referrals per 100 youth, as the cottage style \ncamp is less dependent on the SHU since youth can take a voluntary respite in their own room as \nopposed to all other dormitory style camps where the SHU rooms become the designated respite  \nareas.  Due to the proxim ity of Camps Munz and Mendenhall to the SHU, a 30 t o 45 minute  \ndrive, the SHU is used sparingly.  Staff at these camps comment that by the time they are able to \ntransport the youth to the SHU, when staff are  available and staffing ra tios are appropriate to \nallow for the transport, the youth(s)’ behavior is no longer a safety and/or security concern.  The \nyouth are therefore returned to the camp community.  Camps Scott and Scudder are examples of \nhow population size and staffing ratios aid in k eeping SHU referral rates lower (20 and 17 \nreferrals per 100 youth respectively).  Camp Afflerbaugh houses a large num ber of younger \nyouth, which m ay be part of the reason for thei r m oderate rate of referral.  As Cam p  \nAfflerbaugh’s rates of violence are statistically out of control and require further assessment into \nthe source of the problem (refer to ART section above), the rate of referrals to the SHU will also  \nbe explored. \n \nCamps Rockey and Onizuka are specialty cam ps, housing high risk / high needs youth, and \ntherefore their rates of  referral are expected to be hi gh (99 and 71 referrals per 100 youth \nrespectively).  Camp McNair has a high concentration of youth with mental health needs who are \nprescribed psychotropic medications; thus their moderate rate of  referral is to be expected. Of \nconcern, however, is Camp Jarvis , the equal counterpart to Ca mp McNair.  Since Ca mps Jarvis \nand McNair are part of the sam e facility (Challenger Memorial Youth Center), house the sam e  \ntype of youth, have similar population averages for January through May (Jarvis 68, McNair 70), \n42  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nand have a SHU on-site, it would be expected that  they would have sim ilar SHU referral rates.  \nCamp Jarvis’ rate of referral is double that of  Camp McNair (88 referrals per 100 youth).  Camp  \nJarvis’ population size was substan tially reduced in the m onth of June to address som e of the  \nissues surfacing. With the implementation of the Com prehensive Quality Assurance process as  \ndescribed in Paragraph 47 of this Self-Assessment, the source of the problem will be determined \nand targeted with corrective action during the next reporting period. \n \nAll camps are currently meeting expectations regarding the reason for referral to SHU and youth \nbeing returned to their hom e cam p within four hours of a  camp being notified of release \nreadiness.  \n \nTable 17-7   \nReferrals to the Special Handling Unit (Averages of January – May)  \n \nCamp  Referral rate  % housed  % and #  % \n  to SHU per  less than 24  housed  unknown \n  100 youth  hours  24 hours +     \n          \nNorth Region \nJarvis  88  97%  2%,   6  1% \nMcNair  44  100%         \nOnizuka  71  90%  10%, 19    \nCentral Region     \nMunz  19  100%   \nMendenhall  8  100% \nScudder   17  93%  7%,   2     \nScott  20  71%      29% \nWest Region \nMiller 25  72%  20%, 12 \nGonzales 13  100%  \nDKC 6  98%  2%,   1   \nEast Region  \nRockey 99  97%  1%,   3  2%   \nPaige 32  100%   \nAfflerbaugh 40  97%  3%,   4   \n \nNote:\t   Rate of referral = (average of total # of youth referred to the SHU January – May 2014 / average of total camp population  \nJanuary – May 2014) * 100  \n \n   \n43 \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nLength of Stay  \nOnly 3% (47) of the 1434 SHU referrals were  documented as being in the SHU for  24 hours or  \nlonger. Camps Onizuka, Jarvis, DKC, Miller, Scudder, Rockey, and Afflerbaugh all had youth   \nhoused 24 hours or longer for a variety of reasons ranging from violent gang related behaviors to \nassaultive behavior (staff/minors).  Camp Onizuka experienced a major disturbance in February \nresulting in the housing of 11 minors in the SHU for longer than 24 hours for safety and security \npurposes.  Most camps do not house youth each month for extended periods with the exception \nof Camp Miller.  Extended housing may result from continued negative behavior while housed in  \nthe SHU or pending investigations to clarify the status of safety and security (refer to the Major \nAdministrative Action Reviews section).  Each time a youth is detained in the SHU past a review \nperiod a supervisor m ust provide justification, with required authorization from the Director if \nextended past a 24 hour period.  These checks and balances ensure that youth are not frivolously \nisolated in the SHU for punishment rather than rehabilitative purposes.  \n \nActual Time in Isolation  \nThe audit tool was m odified in February to better reflect true isolation in the SHU during the \nhours in which youth are awake and when activities can be conducted (refer to Table 17-8).  It is  \nimportant to note the efforts of  Probation, Mental Health and educational staff to work with the \nyouth having difficulty adjusting to life in the general camp community who have been removed \nto the SHU.  Some camps have done very well in keeping youth out of isolation for a significant  \namount of time during their SHU stay by involving them in rehabilitative and learning activities.  \nAs is reported in  Table 17-8, Camps Onizuka, Munz, Scott and  Gonzales had high averages of  \n“awake” hours spent in non-isolation.  Youth participated in  school activities in the dayroom of \nthe SHU, c ounseling with Mental Health staff,  and casework activities with Probation staff, \namong other daily routines (hygien e, meal periods) that occur out side of the youth’s room .  As  \nthe gathering of this data has been explorator y, the goal of the Probation Departm ent is to \nincrease non-isolation activities within the SHU over the next reporting period.  \n \n   \n44  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

January was not included as the audit tool did not collect all of the data included in this \ntable. \n \nSpecial Incident Reports and Supervisor’s Assessments  \nResidential Treatm ent Services Bureau (RTS B) staff has continued to improve their \ndocumentation efforts. The sampled Special Incident Reports (SIRs) have justified the reason for \nreferral detailing major rule violations and/or out of control behavior, and the refore have met \nexpectations.  The documentation of a superviso r’s assessment of a youth’s readiness to be \nreleased is improving.  As youth should only remain in the SHU as  long as is necessary to curb \nthe behavior of concern, a supervisor’s assessment is required during each shift, (at least every 8  \nhours) with the exception  of sleeping hours, to authorize a  youth’s continued detention in the \n45  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nSHU. The Release Readiness form provides a standardized method for supervisor’s to document  \nthis assessment of the youth’s be havior and continued safety and  security concerns.   Multiple  \nassessments of a youth m ay be recorded on the sa me form, and should include the supervisor’s \nobservations with a final notation of the date an d time that the youth’s behavior was found to be \ncongruent with his / her release to the general camp community. As with all newly implemented \nand audited processes, the forms were not always completed or found and some did not include \nthe supervisor’s documentation of the youth’s be haviors justifying continued detention.   The  \nRelease Readiness form was m odified in Marc h to clarify and strengthen the docum entation \nefforts. Only a few camps did not meet expectations: in the month March, McNair and Onizuka; \nand in April, Munz, Mendenhall, and Onizuka.  As the previous month’s audits for both cam ps  \nindicated that they met expectations, this m ay be a resu lt of the chang e in f orms.  The camp \nDirectors have agreed to provide a Readiness R elease Form training conference with the camp \nSupervisors.  Due to the proxim ity of Camps Munz and Mendenhall to the SHU an agreem ent \nhas been made with th e Challenge r SHU superviso r’s to  com plete the assessm ent f or the \nrespective camp supervisor.  Corrective action  was therefore provided  to the Cha llenger SHU  \nsupervisor’s to ensure that they properly record all assessments of the youth and the time that the \nrespective camp was notified of a youth’s readiness to be released. \n   \nMajor Administrative Action Reviews  \nSince very few youth are housed  in the SHU for 24 hours or longe r, the Major Adm inistrative \nAction Review forms are not applicable to m ost of the audits conducted.  However, youth have \nbeen held in the SHU for extended periods due to continued aggressive behavior, refusal to leave \nthe SHU, pending investigation, and when the safety  and the security of the youth or others is at \nsubstantial risk of harm pending the start of an Specialized Supervision Plan (refer to  Length of  \nStay section). The March audits showed that  the cam ps housing youth over 24 hours have \ncompleted the f orms, justified housing for the  specified length of tim e and obtained director \napproval.  There were only two instances in wh ich Camp Miller (February) and Cam p Onizuka \n(January) did not m eet expectations.  Corr ective action plans were formally introduced to the  \ncamps in February.   \n \nCamp Miller has im plemented a correc tive action plan that ensures a Major Administrative  \nAction Review form is initiated and com pleted any time a youth is housed up to the 23 rd hour. \nCamp Miller has appro priately completed the Major Ad ministrative Action Review f orm for  \neach of the eight in stances of exten ded housing in the m onths following the Febru ary audits.  \nCamp Miller has a lower rate of referral to th e SHU, 25 referrals per 1 00 youth, of which 20% \nare for extended periods of ti me.  All other risk factors,  such as youth on youth violence \n(YOYV), are under statistical control according to  the Continuous Monitoring System control \nCharts (refer to Paragraph 47 for details). Camp  Miller has a lower rate of YOYV as compared to \nother camps; an average  of 8 incidents per 100 youth compar ed to the highest  at 36 and the   \nlowest at 4 incidents per 100  youth.  This indicates  that the cam p uses the S HU for m ore \negregious behavior which places  the youth at risk.  Coupled w ith the fact th at Camp Miller \nsupervisors have consistently docum ented ju stification for continued detention, m eeting \nexpectations for the entire repo rting period, this suggests that th is higher percentage m ay be \nappropriate for Camp Miller.  However, the  percentages of youth housed for extended periods \nwill continue to be monitored.  \n \n46  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nDiscussion by Monitors: \n \nThe County cam e into substantial com pliance with this provision on Nove mber 1, 2013. Thi s  \nfirst six-month period of compliance monitoring focused on verifying the results of the County’s  \nown audits  and on helping the County to disti ll its  auditing tools into easily access ible \nperformance measures, each with their own ex pected level of performance. In so  doing, the \nCounty shored up its internal cap acity to identify and respond to  problems that may arise with \nthe implementation of its rehabilitative program ming and behavior management system. A few \nglitches with the auditing system  were id entified (e.g., how ART/SG I/DBT attendance and \ncompletion rates we re calculated by auditors; how stage prom otion timeliness was assessed; \nwhether auditors verified that sanctions ha d been com pleted; how  SHU referral rate s an d \nisolation times were calculated), all of which will be refined in the upcoming monitoring period.  \n \nIn order to verify the Department’s audit findings, the Monitor conducted her own review at each \nCamp and t hen compared the results to the previous m onths’ audit reports. W ith only sm all \ndepartures created by the glitch es identified above, the Monitor ’s results lined up nicely with   \nthose the County reported in its self-assessment.   \n \nThis provision has two requir ements and resu lts will be d iscussed separately: 1) rehabilitative \nprogramming that is responsive to youth’s indivi dual needs, and 2) the behavior m anagement \nprogram, which includes the Merit Ladder, sanctions process and SHU.  \n \nRehabilitative Programming  \n \nAudit Methodology. At each of the 13 Cam ps, a sample of youth was identified (i.e., the last 5 \nyouth released in the month prior to the Mon itor’s visit) and Camp  staff delivered case \npresentations by f ollowing written guidance pr ovided by the Monitor.  The Monitor requested \ninformation on the youth’s needs, the types and dos age of services received, the frequency and \nsubstance of casework, youth’s performance in the behavior management program, and whether \nthey were released to the community early/on-time/later than planned. Five cases were reviewed \nat each Camp, for a total of 65 cases, which   is an exceptional dataset upon which to draw \nconclusions about the adequacy of the County’ s rehabilitative programming. [The Monitor did \nnot visit Camp Miller due to scheduling issues.]  \n \nFindings. As in the previous m onitoring period,  the Monitor’s overall finding is that youth’s   \nneeds are being assessed com prehensively during the Initial MDT m eetings (often adding to \nwhat was generated by the CAU) and youth are rece iving services that ar e responsive to those \nneeds. Most often, services include DBT or AR T or one of the sm all group interventions (e.g., \nMoral Reasoning, Skill Stream ing), substance  abuse treatm ent, and individual counseling \nservices for a variety of issues  related to a youth’s mental health diagnosis or other traumas and \nstressors in the youth’s life. W hen needed, youth also participated in gang programming, tattoo \nremoval, and parenting programs.  \n \nIn addition, youth receive a wide array of “extra”  programs, some of which directly respond to \nrisk and crim inogenic needs, othe rs that provide additional stru ctured time with a pro-social \nadult, and still others that teach y outh new skills and hobbies. When the MOA was first signed,  \n47  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nrich program opportunities were a luxury provi ded to youth at only a few of the County’s   \nCamps. Now, youth at all of the Camps enjoy enriched programming.  \n \nUsing the information from the 65 case presentations, the Monitor assessed a series of indicators \nto assess the quality of implementation. These included: \n \n \t  Whether Initial MDTs were held w ithin 10 business days of adm ission. Initial MDTs  \nwere held within 10 business days for 61 of the 65 youth in the sample (94%). Among the \nfour youth whose MDT was not within the requ ired timeframe, all but one were late for \nlegitimate reasons.  \n\t   The proportion of youth who com pleted ART/SGI/DBT. Among the 65 youth, 23 youth \nneeded ART (35%), 15 needed SGI (23%), and 24 needed DBT (37%). Three youth (5%) \nhad recently completed one of the programs during a previous Camp stay.  \n \t  Of the 23 ART youth, 20 com pleted at least 80% of the sessions (87%). Two of \no\nthe three who did not complete were released from Camp extremely early, and the  \nother youth’s Camp had only one ART group at the tim e and did not have a slot \navailable before release.   \n\t   Of the 15 SGI youth, 12 completed at least 80% of the sessions (80%). The three \no\nwho did not complete had attendance problems caused by schedule conflicts with \nother treatment programs. At several Ca mps, youth attend SG I throughout their \nentire stay (and also before and after ART), so the 80% metric is not relevant.  \n\t   Of the 24 DBT youth, 22 com pleted at least 80% of the se ssions (92%). One of \no\nthe two who did not com plete picked  up a new charge, was in court, was \nresentenced and transferred; the othe r youth was pregnant and frequently on \nmedical trans.  \nThese completion rates generally mirror those reported in the Count y’s self-assessment. \nIn only two instances (Ca mp Afflerbaugh, Camp Kilpatrick) was the lack of program   \ncompletion due to system ic factors (i.e.,  conflict with substance abuse programm ing; \ninsufficient program slots) rather than an unavoidable conflict, generally around medical \nissues. \n \n\t   The proportion of youth who completed substance abuse treatment. All but five of the 65 \nyouth had a substance abuse treatm ent need  (92%), and all but four of these 60 youth \n(93%) completed the substance abuse treatm ent program that best responded to their \nneeds (i.e., either the 5- or  10- week program). Most youth  also received individual \nsubstance abuse treatment from a DMH clinician. These completion rates are a bit higher \nthan what was reported in the County’s self assessment, most likely due to Camp staff’s \nadditional follow up when preparing for the ca se presentations. Auditors tended to rely \nonly on the Individual Tracking Form , wh ich as the County reported, was often \nincomplete.  \n \n \t  The proportion of youth who received individual  mental health treatment at a frequency \nconsistent with th eir needs. Of the 65 you th in the samp le, 55 youth (85%) needed \nindividual mental health treatment. One youth’s referral was never received by DMH, but \nthe remaining 54 youth (98%) received the services needed. The frequency of individual \nsessions varied—some youth were seen weekly, others were seen less often, as prescribed \n48  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nby their treatment plans. Only  very rarely were youth not s een for reasons related to a \nlack of availability of a c linician (e.g., m edical leave,  vacancy). Of the 10 youth who \nwere not open to DMH, four of these youth were seen a few tim es to address a crisis that \narose during their stay. \n \n\t   Whether Transitional MDTs were held at  least 30 days prior to  the youth’s release. The \nTransitional MDT m eeting was held at leas t 30 days prior to release for 63 of the 65 \nyouth in the sam ple (97%). The other tw o youth were released much earlier than \nexpected by the Judge. \n  \n \t  Whether home evaluations were conducted at least 30 days  prior to release. About 11% \nof the youth (n=7) in the sample went to placement following their release from Camp, so \na home evaluation was not necessary. Among the remaining 58 youth, a home evaluation  \nwas conducted at least 30 days prior to rel ease in 93% of  the cas es. In two cases, the \nJudge released the youth extremely early; in the other two cases, the field services PO did \nnot meet the required tim eline, even though th e Camp provided rele ase notification as  \nrequired. \n \n \t  Whether casework was adequately documented in PCMS. To assess whether youth were \nbeing seen for casework on a weekly basis,  the Monito r calculated a rate: number of \ncasework sessions in PCMS/tota l weeks in  Camp. All of the Cam ps had satisf actory  \nperformance on this m etric—most of them  were exemplary, with rates higher than the \nMonitor ha s witnessed  in prev ious m onitoring periods. All of the Cam ps have \nimplemented rigorous Supervisory reviews of casework and the effort has clearly paid off \nin term s of the frequency of PCMS entries.   In  an  effort  to  foster  some  healthy  \ncompetition, the Camps’ average ratios are listed below: \n \t  Kilpatrick 97% \no\n \t  Rockey 95% \no\n \t  Scudder 95% \no\n \t  Mendenhall 94% \no\n \t  Scott 93% \no\n \t  Onizuka 92% \no\n \t  DKC 89%  \no\n \t  Jarvis 88% \no\n \t  Munz 88% \no\n \t  Paige 88% \no\n \t  Gonzales 80% \no\n \t  Afflerbaugh 76% \no\n \t  McNair 76% \no\n \n \t  The level of contact between  POs and youth’s fam ily members. Rough estimates were \ndevised in an attempt to quantify the number of substantive contacts POs made with the \nyouth’s family, in comparison to the number of months the youth was in Camp. For most \nof the youth (75%), the PO m ade family contact at least  monthly, with som e Camps \nshowing even more frequent contact for some  kids. However, for about 25% of the youth, \nthe PO made contact less than m onthly. While the level of family engagement is higher \n49  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nthan it has been in the past, it is still an  area in which improvem ents can be m ade. In \naddition to the frequency of  contact, POs should focus on actually engaging the youth’s \nfamily in decisions about the youth’s trea tment and programming and in planning for \ntheir release.   \n \n \t  The length of ti me between adm ission  and the youth’s first casework session.  The \nmonitor devised a basic tim eframe to assess  whether the youth’s fi rst casework session \nwas timely—21 days from admission (14 days for the initial MDT, and then 7 days for   \nthe PO to com e on shift; in retrosp ect, this timeline seem s longer th an is necessary or  \npreferred). Across the 65 youth in the sam ple, all but 3 (95%) had their first casework \nsession within 21 days. Most of ten, the casework sessions  occurred much sooner after \nadmission. Across all 13 Cam ps, the average length of tim e between admission and the \nfirst casework session was 8.2 days. \n \n\t   Whether early release was considered for  the youth, whether it was deem ed appropriate, \nand whether it was granted.  Early release is the lynchpin  of the behavior m anagement \nprogram (discussed in the next section). All Camps now have and utilize a formal process \nto assess youth’s readiness for release and to recommend early release to the court when \nit is war ranted. Each o f the 65 youth in th e sample was considered for early release   \n(100%) and individualized decisions regarding its appropriateness were made. In addition  \nto the number of Made Days earned, the  team also considered  the youth’s program \ncompletion, academic needs, and recen t behavior to determine whether early release \nshould be recommended. \n \nIn the past, a youth’s chances of obtaining  early release depended largely on whether \nhis/her PO was m otivated, organized, and  compelled to subm it all of  the required \npaperwork to make it happen. Because of differences in POs, in those days, early release  \nwas not an incentive that was uniform ly av ailable. However, the Monitor ’s r ecent \nexperience at the Camps revealed quite a different picture. The formalized structures and \nprocedures now mean that every youth has an equal opportunity to earn this incentive. \n \nFurthermore, the County subm itted some compelling data showing th e proportion of \nyouth who are released early and the number of days saved (positive outcome), compared  \nto the number of youth who had tim e added or a new Camp program  ordered (negative \noutcome).  These data are summarized below:  \n   \n50  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

In comparison to the number of youth released each month (average n=148 youth), a small \nnumber of youth have tim e added to their sent ence (average n=12 youth). However, in contrast  \nto the average num ber of days early youth are  released (average n=36 days), youth with time   \nadded generally have their stay lengthened abou t 4 months (average n=120 days). On balance, \nthe County “saves” a significant  number of days (average n=1,208 days per m onth, or about \n14,496 bed days per year). The County’s early release practices have many benefits: \n   They provide a very powerful incentive for  youth to engage in programming and exhibit \npositive behavior while in Camp.  \n   They provide a structured m echanism for assessing youth progress and rewarding it \naccordingly.  \n\t   They demonstrate a commit ment to not ho lding youth in custody  any longer than is \nnecessary to meet the youth’s rehabilitative needs (although th e release decision itself i s  \nout of the County’s control). \n \t  They provide a valuable avenue for cost savings. At a rate of approximately $505 per day \nin Camp, the projected 14,496 saved bed day s  equates to $7.3 million dollars saved in  \njust the first five months of this year.   \n \nBehavior Management Program   \n \nThe Merit Ladder:  In 2012, the County designed an exceptional behavior management program  \n(i.e., the Merit Ladder), created w ritten docum entation, trained staff  and developed audit \nprotocols to support its implementation. These components fully meet the requirements of 2(a)(i) \nthrough (iii), 2(b) and 2(c) of this provision.  \n \nFor quite som e time, the Daily  Merit Ladder (DML) for ms at  each Camp have been under a \nhigh-level of scrutiny. Not only  are they reviewed every 3 da ys and then compiled into a \n51  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nmonthly audit, but staff from the RTSB Bureau Chief’s office also conduct a very detailed audit \neach day. At each Camp, the Monitor reviewed m onthly audits from the previous two months \nand also daily audits from the previous two weeks. Both reviews revealed only small errors (e.g., \nsmall math calculation errors, a  few youth who did not earn the Da ily Reward but received it \nanyway, etc.). The Monitor did a quick visual scan of the DMLs for the month preceding the site  \nvisit and found similar levels of performance. At each Camp, the DMLs are complete, accurate,  \nindividualized and appear to provide a solid  assessment of the extent to which each youth’s \nbehavior conformed to expect ations throughout the day. They  provide stable foundation upon \nwhich youth’s access to incentives and rewards can be based.  \n \nThe ML includes both short and longer-term  rewards. Youth have dependable access to daily \nrewards (an evening snack or sp ecial activity) and weekly rewards (a n opportunity to purchase \nfood or a s pecial hygiene item). They also ear n additional privileges when they accum ulate  \nmultiple days of positive behavior (i.e., a “Made Day”) and are promoted to the next stage. Stage \npromotions bring an array of new r ewards (better hygiene products, special  activities, priority \nseating/bed location, etc.). The ultimate reward is the consideration for early release discussed in  \nthe previous section. In all cases, the Monitor found that the array of rewards are meaningful and \nvaluable to youth, that the rewa rds are distributed once earned,  and that staff and youth fully \nunderstand the thresholds for earning rewards and  believe in the system. The i mplementation of \nthe Merit Ladder system is very solid.  \n \nThe Monitor is very encouraged by the extent to which both staff and youth have bought into the \nprogram. As envisioned by this prov ision, the Merit Ladder has becom e the centerpiece of the \nCounty’s strategy to modify youth’s behavior and discourage misconduct.  \n \nSanctions for Rule Violations :  The other end of the reward—sanction continuum  of the Merit \nLadder is the array of  options for responding to  misconduct. Section 2(d) of this provision \nrequires a “continuum  of individualized conse quences [ to be used] in response to rule \nviolations.” The County developed a sanctions process that includes a wide variety of options for \nstaff—essays, apology letters, com munity serv ice assignm ents, privile ge restriction, Stage \ndemotion, Made Day penalties, etc.  \n \nProgress in this area was slower than on the tec hnical aspects of the DMLs described above, so \nthe Monitor did a comprehensive audit, reading all of the sanctions created since January at each  \nCamp. The sanctions process was fully intact  in some of the Ca mps (Rockey, McNair, DKC, \nScott, Scudder and Gonzales). The sanctions we re procedurally complete and the assignm ents \nwere both thoughtful and proportional. Som e of th e other Ca mps, however, struggled with a \nvariety of problems mostly related to the quality of the assignment or the effort displayed by the \nyouth. Written assignments that are largely a theoretical exercis e (e.g., “Write 500 words on \nWhy it is Important to Follow Directions) are less effective than those designed to create insight \ninto one’s behavior (e.g., “Why were you so frustrated? What was going on with you when you \ndisrespected the teacher?). Furtherm ore, even though Supervisors are now required  to sign the  \nsanctions form to indicate the sanction has been  completed, some of t he attached assignm ent \nevidenced very little effort on  the part of the yout h (e.g., one word answ ers to Thinking Report \nquestions; essays that simply repeated the sam e sentence over and over). The effectiven ess of  \nthis tool will depend on the quality of the as signments and the Supervisors need to set and \n52  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nreinforce high standards. Finally, to the extent  that non-writing assignments are imposed (e.g., \ncommunity service, w ork detail, job suspensi on, etc.), the successful  com pletion of these \nsanctions should be documented on the sanctions form. Although there are som e places where  \nthe process can be strengthened,  overall, the sanctions process  is a viable com ponent of the \noverall behavior management program.  \n \nAs noted in the County’s self-assessm ent, the Ca mps have wide differen ces in the frequency \nwith which sanctions are used . Based on the conversations th e Monitor held with Cam p  \nDirectors, it appears that these differences are intentional. In other words, some of the Directors  \nwanted sanctions to be the primary tool for responding to negative behavior, and other Directors \nwanted to rely on other tools  (e.g., giving zeros on the DML, disc ussing negative behavior in \ngroup, etc.). Either way is legitimate, as long as the low-use Camps are not simply suffering from  \na lack of staff knowledge or a lack of accountability for youth.  \n \nLimits to the Use of Isolation:  Section 2(d)(1) and  (2) require the C ounty to limit the use of \nisolation to those situations in which a youth presents an imminent risk of harm to another youth \nor staff and must be de-escalated. In 2013, the C ounty issued a new Directive for the use of the \nSpecial Housing Unit (i.e., SHU;  where youth are placed as a disc iplinary sanction for serious  \nrule violations). Importantly, this provision requires that the youth’s length of stay must be based \non the nature of his/her current behavior and the youth must be returned to the general population \nas soon as the risk of harm to others has dissipated. Staff training was complete on July 30,2013 \nand implementation began on August 1, 2013.  \n \nAlthough all Camps send youth to the SHU, the M onitor focused on the im plementation of the \ndirective at the five Camps with an on-site SHU, as the documentation for all referrals are kept \non-site. [Camp Gonzales has a SHU but it was  closed during the Monitor’s visit. It was   \nscheduled to re-open w hen Camp Kilpatrick closed for renovati on.] At each SHU facility, the \nMonitor reviewed a sample of 15- 20 SHU folders from the month prior to the site visit (to tal  \nsample about 85 SHU folders). While there w ere slight differences among the Cam ps, general \nfindings related to the SHU include: \n \n \t  Youth are sent to the SHU only for major misconduct. A review of the SIRs for each SHU \nreferral indicated th at youth are no longer  sent to the SHU for failing to follow \ninstructions or other  non-aggressive behaviors. Instead,  the SIRs provide evidence that \nthe youth presented an immediate and legitimate safety threat and th at less restrictive \nmeasures had failed. [It is important to remember that all of the Camps (except DKC) \nhave dormitory housing and so options for  separating youth from the general population \nare somewhat limited.] \n \n \t  Youth are assessed for their readiness to retu rn to the general population according to \npolicy.   While there is som e room f or improvement in this ar ea, most of  the y outh  \nreceived the first Readiness for Release check within a reasonable amount of time (i.e., 2-\n4 hours). In some cases however, particularly at the Challenger SHU, some of the youth \nwere not checked in a tim ely manner (i.e., they were not checked before the end of the \nshift during which they were initially placed in the SHU—only on the following shift). At  \n53  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nthe other SHU facilities, Supervisors were very diligent in checking the youth frequently, \nusually far exceeding the once-per-shift policy requirement.  \n \n \t  When Supervisors decide not to release a  youth, the reasons for that decision are   \nlegitimate and clearly articulated . Supervisors have done a comm endable job in \ndescribing the words, behaviors  and attitudes of the youth that  indicate that they are not \nready to safely return to the general population.  \n \n \t  When an Administrative Hold is used to hold a youth in SHU beyond 24 hours, the time is \nclearly used to devise a plan for release that will enhance safety. Most of these youth are \nplaced on S pecial Supervision Plans (SSP), wh ile some are returned to court for new \ncharges or a Change of Plan. \n \n \t  The youth’s lengths of stay in  the SHU are of  reasonable lengths. Because the S HU is \nused only to de-escalate youth and is no longe r used for punishment, the lengths of stay \nin the SHU are consequ ently much shorter than  in past years. This is d efinitely in line  \nwith best practices and the evolving standard s in the f ield. As discussed in the self -\nassessment, only 3% of the SHU stays were  for 24 hours or m ore. Collapsing the data \npresented in Table 17-8, the average length of stay across all Camps was 14.6 hours, with \n7 of those hours, on average, being duri ng sleeping tim e. During waking hours, youth \nwere typically in their room s for 6 hours and  out of their room for 2 hours, on average. \nBased on the Monitor’s experience in other jurisdictions, the length of stay during waking \nhours is reasonable, and the fact that m ost youth have portions of the waking hours that \nare spent outside of their rooms helps to mitigate the harmful effects of isolation.  \n \nThat said, the County’s self-assessm ent discusses some ongoing training of Supervisors \ndesigned to create closer a dherence to policy requirem ents. If the S upervisors make  \nReady for Release assessments more often, the length of stay in the S HU can decrease \neven further. The quality of processing betw een staff and youth during the time they are  \nin the SHU will ensure that  the youth’s reintegr ation into the general population is \nexecuted safely. \nThe County remains in Substantial Compliance with this provision. Assuming that the same level \nof performance is maintained, the compliance monitoring period should end October 31, 2015.  \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n   Site visits to Camps Afflerbaugh, Paige, Rockey, Kilpatrick, Gonzales, Onizuka, McNair, \nJarvis, Scott, Scudder, DKC, Munz and Mendenhall. \n   Case Presentations of 5 youth most recently released at each Camp, along with the source \ndocumentation, total sample = 65 youth \n   Review of program tracking logs  \n   Review of Merit Ladder point sheets and s upporting documentation for the two months  \nprior to the site visit at each Camp  \n   Review of DOJ Audit Bureau’s audits, January-May 2014 \n   Review of Sanctions forms from January 2014 to the date of the site visit \n   Review of SHU Folders from one month prior to the date of the visit \n54  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \t  Extensive consultation with Probation and DMH administrators and staff involved in the \ndesign, im plementation and auditing of  the Merit Ladder, Sanctions, SHU and \nrehabilitative programming \nParagraph  43:  Substance  Abuse  \n \nThe Count y shall develop and implement polic ies, procedures, and practices to address \nsubstance use disorders appropriately.  The County agrees to take the following steps:   \n \nIdentify youth with substance abuse disorders.  Ensure that youth who (1) have a confirmed   \nsubstance abuse diagnosis/disorder or (2) are otherwise identified as needing substance abuse \ntreatment, receive substance abuse treatment.   If a youth refuses tr eatment, the County shall \ndocument the refusal and make reasonable attempts  to re-direct the youth back to treatment.   \nReevaluate for a substance abuse disorder/diagnosis any youth who has not been identified as  \nhaving such a disorder/diagnosis, upon deter mination that the youth falls into  one of the   \nfollowing categories:  youth has a positive scr eening on the substance abuse scale of any \nscreening or assessment measure used by the County; yo uth self-reports a significant history \nof substance use; youth has used illegal drug s at the Ca mps or in  County custody; and/or \nyouth has been referred for substance abuse treatment by staff.  Ensure that each Camp offers  \nevidence-based substance abuse treatment services or programs by:  identifying the evidence-\nbased treatment service or program to be used  at each Camp; imple menting the service or  \nprogram at each Camp; and ensuring that the  service or program has  sufficient capacity to \nensure that all eligible youth at each Camp ma y participate.  Take reasonable steps to prevent  \nyouth from having access to illegal drugs at the Camps.   \n \nAs part of its evaluation to determine wh ether the implemen tation of paragraph 43, as \namended, is addressing the substance abuse tr eatment needs of youth and cont ributing to \nimproved conditions, the Monito ring Team sh all consider the following f actors, as   \nappropriate:  the number of incidents of yo uth previou sly treated for substan ce abuse \ntreatment at the Camp s who subsequently us e illegal dr ugs at the Camps; pro gress toward  \nmeeting substance abuse treatment-related goals, as determined by the MDT; number of youth \nreferred for substance abuse treatment; num ber of youth who comp lete substance abuse  \ntreatment programming; results of Count y-administered pre- and post-tests regardin g  \nsubstance abuse.  \n \nStatus: Full Compliance (effective June 13, 2014) \n \nCounty’s Self-Assessment: \n \nDuring this Monitoring Period, the County has c ontinued to provide comprehensive substance \nuse/abuse services for youth at  all Probation cam ps.  Each cam p has m ore than sufficient \ncapacity to provide services to eligible youth .  This includes those  youth with a substance \nuse/abuse disorder, as well as those youth who are otherwise identified as potentially at risk.   \n \n55  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nFor all camps, DMH has been providing services for youth who have been identified as having a \nco-occurring disorder since the  expansion of staff in 2010-11.  As part of these services, DMH   \nprovides integrated interventions  that treat both disorders.   An integ rated appro ach is the \ntreatment of choice for those youth who have bot h a m ental health and substance use/abuse \ndisorder.  As detailed below in  Table 43-1, DMH continues to provide services to a high \npercentage of the youth housed in the Probation camps: \n \nTable 43-1 \nAVERAGE PERCENT OF OPEN MENTAL CASES BASED ON AVERAGE POPULATION \nCBA  CDG  CFM  CGR  CJP  CVK  CEO  CGJ  CRM  CWM  CJM  CJS  CKS  DKC \n99%  100%  98%  100%  99%  100%*  100%  98%  100%  84%  50%  100%  100%  100% \n*Camp Kilpatrick was closed from April through the end of Monitoring Period.  \n \nFor Camps Munz, Mendenhall, Jarvis and McNair , Department of Public Health, Substance \nAbuse and Prevention Control (S APC) has been  providing substance use/abuse services for \nseveral years.  DMH also has full tim e substance abuse counselors (eithe r directly-operated or \ncontracted) assigned to Onizuka, Munz, Mende nhall, Scott, Scudder,  M iller, Kilpatrick,  \nGonzales, Rockey, Afflerbaugh, Paige and Dorot hy Kirby Center.  These staff supplem ent the  \nservices provided by the assigned clinician. \n \nDuring this Monitoring Period, the County has con tinued to provide five and ten week groups \nacross the Probation camps to further enhance serv ices and to improve the ease of tracking that \nyouth identified with potential substance use/abuse needs have been provided with services prior \nto release from camp.  The 5 week curriculum is a psycho-educational group series intended for \nyouth who do not have a substance use/abuse dia gnosis, but who have been identified as having \npotential risk factors.  The 10 week curriculum  is for youth who have open m ental health cases \nand who have been diagnosed with a co-occurring disorder.  The 10 week group uses \nmotivational interviewing and cognitiv e behavior interv entions which are evidence-ba sed \npractices for youth with co-occurring disorders.  The 5 and 10  week substance use/abuse groups \nsupplement the individual services provided by DMH clinicians.   \n \nIn addition to the 10 week curriculum, DMH continues to enhance the treatment interventions for \nclients with co-occurring disorders by providing training in Seek ing Safety, an evid ence-based \nmodel that has demonstrated effectiveness in addressing substance abuse and trauma issues.  On \nApril 16, 2014, a training specifically tailored to address the unique clinical needs of youth being \ntreated in a  juvenile ju stice setting was provid ed to clinical staff.  Seeking Safety refresher \ncourses were offered on the following dates to  staff who had previously taken the one-day \ntraining: 2/12/14, 2/18/14, 2/25/14 and 2/26/14.  In  order to ensure fidelity to th e model, two  \nseparate sets of ten weekly one  hour consultation calls with th e Seeking Safety trainer were \nprovided to staff using the Seeking Safety intervention.  \nDMH continues to utilize the a uditing tools which were develo ped in consu ltation with the \nMonitor for the individual therapy provided to y outh with co-occurring disorders.  The auditing \ntool evaluates whether the treatment goals for co-occurring disorders address the symptoms and \nimpairments identified in the assessment; whether the client is receiving or has received services  \nto add ress his/her co -occurring d isorder; whet her progress notes identify the co-occurring \ndisorder goal set forth in the treatment plan (CCCP); and whether the progress notes demonstrate \n56  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nwhat has been attempted and/or accomplished toward the attainment of the co-occurring disorder  \ntreatment goal.   \n \nDuring the current Monitoring Period, DMH has  maintained an average level of compliance for \nthis Provision 43 of 97% as outlined below in Table 43-2: \n \nTable 43-2 \nProvision 43 - Substance Abuse \nJanuary 1 - June 13, 2014 Summary Data     \n     \nALL Facility - \nJanuary - March  Average by  \nScreen  \n1: Goals for services on the CCCP address the COD/SA symptoms & \nimpairments (if any) identified in the Assessment.   98%  \n2: Client is receiving or has received services (group or individual) that \naddress SA/COD issues  (Yes=100) (No=0)   100%  \n3: Progress Notes for SA/COD services identify the SA/COD goal(s) as  \nset forth in the CCCP.  93%  \n4: Progress Notes for SA/COD services demonstrate what was \nattempted/accomplished toward SA/COD goal(s).   96%  \nQuarterly Compliance  97%  \n     \nALL Facility - \nApril - June 13  Average by  \nScreen  \n1: Goals for services on the CCCP address the COD/SA symptoms & \nimpairments (if any) identified in the Assessment.   98%  \n2: Client is receiving or has received services (group or individual) that \naddress SA/COD issues  (Yes=100) (No=0)   98%  \n3: Progress Notes for SA/COD services identify the SA/COD goal(s) as  \nset forth in the CCCP.  98%  \n4: Progress Notes for SA/COD services demonstrate what was \nattempted/accomplished toward SA/COD goal(s).   96%  \nQuarterly Compliance  98%  \n    \nALL Screen         \nJanuary 1 - June 13, 2014  ALL Facility  \nProvision 43 \nAverage  \nOverall Compliance  97%  \n  \n \n   \n57  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

These num bers have been \ncaptured on the Substance Abuse Audit tool for analysis purposes showing that a majority (82%) \nof the youth entering camp have an identified need (see Table 43-3).  The numbers also indicate \nthat there is a greater need for the more intens ive 10 week service.  The Departm ent of Mental \nHealth has responded to the gr owing need by using contract ed Substance Abuse Treatm ent  \nproviders to increase program capacity.   \n \nTable 43-3   \nSubstance Abuse Service Needs (January – May)  \n \nCamp  # of youth  % of new  # in need  # in need o \n  admitted to  admits in  of 5 week  of 10 week \n  camp  need of SA  services  services \n          \nNorth Region \n  Jarvis  70  94%  15  43 \nMcNair  70  97%  1    67 \nOnizuka  40  100%   2    38 \nCentral Region     \nMunz  78  97%  3    73  \nMendenhall  54  78%  1    36 \nScudder   39  97%  15    22 \nScott  29  96%  5    24  \nWest Region \nMiller 52  68%  5    28 \nGonzales 20  4%  1    1   \nDKC  47  98%  0    46  \nEast Region \nRockey 41  80%  8  33 \nPaige  65  88%  6  23  \nAfflerbaugh  83  72%  12  47 \n \nNote:\t   % of new admits identified with need = (total # of newly admitted youth January – May 2014 / total number of youth identified \nwith 5 or 10 week program need) * 100 \n \nDuring the first quarter of 2014, the Substance Abus e audit tool was modified to define what \nfindings meet expectations and what requires corrective action (refer to Table 43.2 below).

Due to the  \nnature of the youth in the facility (all having  co-occurring disorders), each cottage had ongoing \nsubstance abuse sess ions.  Every newly adm itted youth was autom atically enrolled in the \nprogram upon entry to his or her cottage.  The  existing audit tool only captured the successful \ncompletion rates of a group and not youth who m ay have repeated multiple groups.  Therefore, \nthe true rate of youth success was n ot accurately reflected and was actually m uch higher.  Th e \naudit tool for DKC wa s consequently altered to capture a youth’s successful co mpletion of \nservices upon their exit from  camp. As components of DKC’s system  were found to be   \nunnecessary, the cam p transitioned  in late March from  facilitating Substance Abuse groups \naccording to cottage to the standard method which all camps use; groups are now assigned based \non youth needs.  The standard audit tool is no w appropriate for use w ith DKCs intervention \ntracking system. \n \nNewly Admitted Youth Referrals  \nA all of the camps have met expectations consistently in referring youth identified in need of  \nservices to their respective five or ten week program  within 14 days of a rrival except for Camp  \nJarvis (April) and Camp Scudder (March) who did  not meet expectations. On the occasion that \nexpectations have not been m et, the cam p has identified the problem  and has implem ented \ncorrective action.  It was determined that Camp  Jarvis’ referral rate  was not a pattern, but   \npotentially due to staff vacations during the m onth.  Expectations have since been m et.  A \nprocedural change caused several Ca mp Scudde r referrals to be one day late, which wa s  \ncorrected upon discovery in mid-April.   \n \nEnrollment and Attendance  \nThe audit tool was m odified in February to  allow Probation the ability to captu re attendance  \nrates.  It was discovered during the reporting period that the In tervention Tracking Log did not \nnecessarily match the Department of Mental Health (DMH) session rosters at several camps.  A \nlack of communication resulted  in Probation “shorting” session attendance num bers. There is a \nneed for a clearer process and manner of communication between Probation and Mental Health.  \nAn assessment is underway to determ ine the source of the problems if any at each cam p and a \nsuitable process whereby the attendance information can be uniformly obtained from DMH.  The  \nissues vary  between cam ps; som e issues st em from the contracted  providers s ession  \ndocumentation on the roster, contracted prov iders differing lengths of programm ing, staff \ndocumentation on the Intervention Tracking Log, and the memorialization of make-up days.  As  \nthese problems have only recently come to light,  corrective action will be forthcoming during the \nnext reporting period. \n \nDespite this oversight which ultimately reflects greater participation rates in the substance abuse  \nprogram, the camps have made tremendous strides during the quarter to document service needs \n60  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nand attendance on the shared drive Intervention Tracking Log.  Some camps were previously not \nlogging services at all, others  only partially entering certain serv ices (i.e. not entering outside \nprovider services), while other  camps did not have updated versio ns of the log from  which the \naudit tool was based.  Much of the inform ation needed to be obtained from  the MDT \nCoordinators at the camp ra ther than simply verified.  Camp Jarvis is one of the camps that is \nimproving in its documentation; however, its shortcomings can be seen in the higher percentage \nof youth enrolled and not attending services du ring the m onth.  This is  due, in part, to youth \nbeing out of the facility for medical appointments or court appearances, but also due to staff not \nupdating information in the Log.  T his was not an  issue in the March audit of Jarvis indicating \nthat they have resolved the issue.  The strides made by the camps in maintaining an updated log \nwill assist in Probation ’s ability to  quickly co nfirm whether the Inte rvention Tracking Log \nmatches the information provided by DMH. \n \nSubstance Abuse Session Refusals  \nAn area of concern for the repor ting period is the docum entation of caseworkers’ endeavors to \ncounsel youth refusing to a ttend a Substance Abuse trea tment sessions (refer to  SA Session \nRefusals section of  Figure 43-1).  Staff needs to m ake an effort to redirect the youth to attend \nfuture SA sessions and potentially m ake-up the session missed.  Though, in speaking with the \ncamps, they are in fact encouraging the youths ’ participation, the Prob ation Officers are not \nalways docum enting these efforts  in the Pr obation Case Managem ent System (PCMS).    \nCorrective Action Plan s (CAPs) have been de veloped and are being monitored on a m onthly \nbasis.  Documentation in PCMS has improved substantially as a result. Camps Onizuka, Rockey, \nScott, Scudder, and Munz have consistently met expectations (January through May) due to zero \nrefusals for the month or 100% documentation of refusals.  Both scenarios indicate that staff are \nencouraging youth participation and are activel y involved in case planning.  Corrective action \nmay have impacted tho se camps not in com pliance in April as all cam ps met expectations the  \nfollowing month. \n \nService Completion  \nGenerally, the cam ps are progressing with su ccessful service c ompletion rates,  whic h \ndemonstrate that the Substance Abuse program is being well received by the youth.  During the \nreporting period, three cam ps showed trends of pe rcentages not meeting expectations in the 5 \nweek and/or 10 week program s; Camp Onizuka, Camp Afflerbaugh and  Dorothy Kirby Center \n(see Tables 43.5 and 43.6).  Various reasons exist for unsu ccessful completion percentages (as \nstated in the comments section of the audit tools) including but not limited to: youth out of camp  \nduring sessions, m ake-up sessions not docum ented or communicated to Probation, or youth \nbeing transferred from other camps or juvenile halls with little confinement time remaining upon  \nreferral for services.  Auditor error may have compounded the issue, as data may not have been \ncollected properly.  A few of th e rates were greatly im pacted by smaller group size; as can be \nseen in Table 43-3 and Table 43-4.  The performance expectation for this section is determ ined \nbased on th e combined percentage of youth successfully graduating from  the 5 and 10 week   \nservices. \n \nFurther assessment with the Com prehensive Quality Assurance process (refer to Paragraph 47 \nfor details) may be necessary to de termine the true source of the problem  (i.e. process related, \nstemming from staff, environmental factors, or technological issue with the tracking system).  As \n61  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nthese issues come to light and as ap propriate corrective action targeted at the true source of the \nproblem is implemented, improvement will be seen in the three aforementioned camps and will \nreduce the occurrences of anomalies in all camps.   \n \nTable 43-3   \nSubstance Abuse Audit 5 Week Services (January – May)  \n*5 WEEK SERVICES \nCamp by \nRegion  January  February  March  April  May \nuth eted  ssful uth eted  ssful uth eted  ssful uth  eted  ssful uth eted  ssful \nopl %e opl %e opl %e opl %e opl %e\nym c ym c ym c ym c ym c\n# o uc # o uc # o uc # o uc # o uc\nc s c s c s c s c s\n  \nEast:                            \nAfflerbaugh  4  **75%   5  100%   3  100%   0  0%  5  100%  \nPaige  0  0%  4  100%   0  0%  0  0%  6  100%  \nRockey  1  100%   0  0%  1  100%   4  100%   2  14% \nWest:                     \nMiller   0  0%  0  0%  0  0%  4  100%   0  0% \nGonzales   0  0%  0  0%  0  0%  2  100%   0  0% \nCentral:                       \nScott  0  0%  2  100%   0  0%  0  0%  1  100%  \nScudder   2  100%   4  100%   1  100%   4  0%  100   0% \nMunz  0  0%  0  0%  3  100%   0  0%  0  0% \nNorth:                       \nOnizuka  6  **17%   0  0%  8  **75%   0  0%  6  100%  \nJarvis  0  0%  5  100%   5  100%   0  0%  6  100%  \nNote:  *No youth were enrolled in the 5 w eek program  during the reporting period in Dorothy Kirby Center, Camp \nMcNair and Camp Mendenhall.  \n**Percentages noted in re d are be low the 80% thresh old but may ha ve met ex pectations depending on  \ncombined average with the 10 week program. \n \n   \n62  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

Meeting expectat ions was defined as \nthe camp not exceed ing a 5% rate of incidents  per population size.  All cam ps have been \nmaintaining rates that meet expectations with the exception  of Camps Mendenhall (March and \nApril), Scudder (May) and Gonzales (February) (see Table 43-5).  It was noted during the audits \nthat these camps have increased their preventative measures including searches and random drug \ntesting.  Because of these efforts, drug paraphe rnalia have been found and youth have tested   \npositive for drug use.  Staff is also return ing youth to court who are repetitious ly involved in \ndrug related incidents and jeopard izing the safety and reha bilitation of the you th in the c amp \ncommunity.  Increased rates are  to be expected until the youth  learn that the consequences \noutweigh the immediate gratification.  These camps’ efforts in conjunction with their higher rates \nof incidents have reinforced the fact that  they are actively involved in safeguarding the \n63  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \ncommunity and therefore in compliance with this Provision.  The Continuous Monitoring System \n(CMS) (refer to Paragraph 47 for details) control charts showing trends of no incidents might be  \nan indication that stronger efforts need to be taken by camp staff to search and test for controlled \nsubstances.  The frequency of random drug testing and searches in those facilities with a pattern \nof no incidents will be explored  in the nex t reporting period with the  implementation of the  \nCMS. \n \nTable 43-5   \nRate of Drug Related Incidents (February – May)  \n \nCamp by Region  February  March  April  May \n          \nNorth Region \n  Jarvis  2%  0%  0%  0% \nMcNair  0%  3%  0%    1% \nOnizuka  4%  0%  2%    0% \nCentral Region     \n  Munz  1%  0%  0%  1%   \nMendenhall  4%  9%   13% 0% \nScudder   0%  0%  0%  5%  \nScott  0%  0%  0%  0%   \nWest Region \nMiller   2%  5%  4%  2% \nGonzales   7% 0%  0%  3% \nDKC  0%  2%  0%  0% \nEast Region \nRockey   4%  0%  4%  0% \nPaige  4%  0%  0%  1% \nAfflerbaugh  0%  0%  0%  3% \n \nNote: *Percentages noted in red did not meet expectations. \n \nDiscussion by Monitor: \n \nThe County has made enormous progress since the MOA was signed in assessing youth’s needs  \nfor substance abuse treatm ent, shoring up the  referral process and building additional capacity \nfor substance abuse treatm ent at each of th e Camps. The County wa s found in substantial \ncompliance in June 2013 and has successfully com pleted the compliance monitoring period. In \nparticular: \n \n64  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \t  All Camps have a v ariety of treatm ent modalities available to m eet the youth’s  needs. \nThese can include a 5-week psychoeducat ional group, a 10-week group for youth with \nco-occurring mental health disorders, groups provided by community partners, individual \ntreatment provided by DMH and individual tr eatment provided by community partners. \nThe group curricula are rooted  in evidence-based practices . All Cam ps have sufficient \ncapacity to m eet the dem and for services. Fo r many youth, individual  treatment is the \nprimary modality and is supplemented by the group treatment.  \n\t   Youth are screened for substance abuse trea tment needs by the Cam p Assessment Unit \nand again during the Initial  MDT upon arriving at Cam p. An in-depth assessm ent is \nadministered by DMH to youth with a positive screen and a co-occurring mental illness. \n \t  Youth are promptly referred for enrollment in the treatment modality that is best suited to  \ntheir needs. Nearly all of  the youth involved in the Monito r’s case presentation sample  \n(60 of 65 youth; 92%) were as sessed as needing substance abuse treatment, and all but \none (98%) were referred for treatment within 14 days of their admission to Camp.  \n \t  All but four of the 60 youth (93%) completed group substance abuse treatment. Attempts \nto verify the completion data delivered during the case presentations and the findings of \nProbation’s monthly audits revealed problems with the accuracy of the S ubstance Abuse \nTracking Logs. Probation and DMH identified  the source of the problems and enacted a \nsolution during the current monitoring period.   \n \nAs required by this provision, the C ounty reported a variety of outcomes in its self-assessment. \nAs shown in Table 43-2, with regard to the qu ality of individual substance abuse treatm ent \ndelivered by DMH, observed performance levels across the four measures ranged from 93-100% \ncompliance. These da ta are com pelling and m irror the high-qua lity m ental health s ervices  \ndiscussed during the case presentations at  each Camp. DMH also c ontinues to track youth \noutcomes to assess whether youth’s group treatm ent involvement results in different thinking \nabout their substance using be havior.  Using a 12-m onth timeframe, the County compared the \npre-test and post-test scores on the  Attitudes and Beliefs about Substances questionnaire for 450 \nyouth who com pleted the 10-week substance a buse group. The results  were statistically \nsignificant ( t(450) = - 3.280, p<.0005) ,   indicating that youth chan ged their thinking and \nmotivation for making changes in their substance abusing behaviors.  \n \nProbation’s Quality Assurance process tracked performance related to the other two outcom es \nrequired by the prov ision—group completion and the  use of illegal substances while in Cam p. \nThese results are succinctly reported in Tables  43-3 and discussed in the subsequent bullet points \nof the self-assessment.  \n \nThe results highlight the extrem ely high prevalence of substance abuse issues am ong the youth \nwho are ad mitted to C amp, and that m ost of the you th have im pairments caused by the ir \nsubstance abuse behaviors that lead to a mental health diagnosis of dependence. That DMH was  \nable to shift resources to create additional capacity in the 1 0-week groups is evidence that the \nCounty is utilizing its Quality Assurance data to respond to the changing needs of its population. \nFurthermore, the self-assessm ent reveals that  the County is carefu lly tracking program \ncompletion rates to ensure that  youth m aximize the benefits of these program s. The County’s \naudit process collects and analyzes outcome related data, identifies facilities that are not meeting \nexpectations, and mobilizes the process to address the underlying causes of the problems.  \n65  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nThe County has dem onstrated its ability and w illingness to develop, implem ent, monitor and \nadjust its substance abuse program s to meet the needs of the youth serv ed by the C amps. The  \nMonitor believes that external oversight is no  longer necessary, and thus it is appropriate to \nterminate compliance monitoring.  \n \nEvidentiary Basis:  \n   Site visits to Camps Afflerbaugh, Paige, Rockey, Kilpatrick, Gonzales, Onizuka, McNair, \nJarvis, Scott, Scudder, DKC, Munz and Mendenhall. \n   Case Presentations of 5 youth most recently released at each Camp, along with the source \ndocumentation, total sample = 65 youth \n   Review of program tracking logs for group and individual substance abuse treatment \n   Review of DOJ Audit Bureau Substance Abuse Treatment audits completed January-May \n2014 \n   Review of DMH Substance Abuse Quality Assurance results, January-June 2014 \n   Lists of youth involved in drug-related m isconduct during the two m onths prior to the \nMonitor’s visit and whether the youth were engaged in/had been referred to treatment \n   Extensive consultation with Probation and DMH administrators and other staff involved \nin the design and i mplementation of the  substance abuse treatm ent protocols and \nprogramming \n \nParagraph 47: System  \n \nThe County shall co ntinue to colle ct suff icient and reliable data to evaluate the \nimplementation of the paragraphs of this Agreement. The County shall revise and/or institute \nquality a ssurance systems to ens ure imp lementation o f the paragr aphs addressed in th is \nAgreement. The County shall continue to analyz e the data collected in its quality assurance   \nsystems and proactively and independently take  corrective action, including adjusting th e  \ndelivery and/or content of programs and collec tion of pe rformance indicators, when results  \nindicate that such action is needed. \n \nStatus:  Substantial Compliance (effective November 1, 2013)  \n \nCounty’s Self-Assessment: \n \nQUALITY ASSURANCE  \n \nAudit Performance  \nIn the first quarter of 2014, audi t performance expectations were established and added to the \naudit too ls. These expectations w ere es tablished through collabo ration between the DOJ   \nMonitors and Bureau managem ent to improve audit performance. The audit tools now indicate \nwhether a facility has met audit expectations by exceeding defined percentage criteria in each \naudit domain. If a facility does not m eet audit expectations, auditors notify and meet with the \nfacility director to develop co rrective measures to achieve the followin g month’s expectations.  \nThe corrective measures are then documented on the audit tool to be reviewed by the auditors for  \n66  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nprogress in the following audit months. As the audits and processes have improved over the last \ntwo quarters, the County is now preparing for  the next stage of de veloping comprehensive \nquality assurance with the Continuous Monitoring System. \n \nContinuous Monitoring System  \nSince the last Self-Assessm ent Re port, a new    Continuous Monitoring System  has been in \ndevelopment by the DOJ/Quality Assurance Services Bureau. The system is designed to monitor \nongoing data such as youth-on-youth violence, drug-related incidents, audit compliance rates, or \nany other data that the Department chooses to monitor and improve. Control charts in the system \nare used to plot incoming data and to identify anomalous trends that require inquiry or corrective \nmeasures. The goal is to provide continuous pr ocess improvement by establishing performance  \nexpectations, m onitoring data, developing corr ective action plans, increas ing collabo ration  \nbetween units, conducting recommendation reviews, and establishing accountability. The system \nis planned to be fully implem ented during the  next Monitoring Period. Once audit results and \nprogram measures have been collected, the data  will be entered into the monitoring system. As \ndata are en tered, con trol charts in  the syst em will autom atically update and  display an y \nanomalous occurrence or trend. Ea ch facility will have a monitori ng system file with audit and \nprogram data that will be monitored and maintained by DOJ/Quality Assurance Services Bureau. \nIf an anomalous program trend or consistent difficulty in meeting audit expectations is identified,  \na collaborative meeting will be held between the monitoring reviewers and the facility director to  \ndiscuss possible causes for the trend or anomaly.  \n \nIf necessary, a proces s-related review will be conducted to  tho roughly examine prog ram \nprocesses for barriers and possible areas f or improvement.  This review will con sist of data  \ncollection and data analysis with a report consisting of findings and process recommendations. A \nwidely kno wn and use d quality c ontrol too l w ill be  use d to a ssist with acc urate prob lem  \nidentification. The Fishbone diagram, also known as  the cause and effect diagram , will be used \nto review potential variables that may be producing unfavorable program results. These variables \ninclude Manpower (staff), Milieu (environm ent), Method (process), Materials (documents, etc.) \nand Machine (technology).  After careful review of these variables and collected data, a findings \nreport with process recommendations and corrective action plan will be submitted to the facility \ndirector. The spec ifics of the cor rective action plan will be at the  discretion of the f acility  \ndirector regarding implementation timeframes and people responsible for implementation.  \n \nTo ensure accountability and im plementation of recommendations, a recomm endation review  \nwill be conducted at a specified time after the corrective action plan has been agreed upon. The \nrecommendation review m ay consist of a site  visit, process observation, file review, or \ninterviews to dete rmine if  recommendation s were im plemented and the cu rrent progr ess. \nFeedback will be provided to the facility Director and documented. \n \nA Quality Assurance File System  will be cre ated and mainta ined for future references. The \ncomprehensive file system will co nsist of audit results, CMS control charts, p rocess-related  \nreviews, corrective action plans, and recommendation reviews. The data from the file system will \nbe used for biannual self-assessm ents or quality  assurance analysis to id entify process barriers, \ntype of intervention taken, and process progress. A demonstration of CMS was given to the DOJ \nMonitors in May and was very well received.  \n67  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nEnhancing Efficiency  \nThe results from  the Continuous Monitoring System  may also be used to enhance efficiency. \nCamps meeting all exp ectations  in all audit areas for a tim e period of three m onths may not \nrequire monthly auditing, rather  a quarterly audit review as  recommended by Monitor Kelly \nDedel. Graduating a camp to a qua rterly audit after demonstrating exemplary audit results for a \nthree month period would allow staff to assist camps in need, as identified by CMS. Staff woul d \nbe able to conduct process-related reviews and  problem identification at cam ps that have had \ndifficulty meeting audit expectations. This would ensure the eventual graduation of all camps in \nmeeting expectations and transitioning to a quarter ly audit. The quarterly audit would consist of \na random review of audit data from the auditi ng quarter. If a camp should not m eet quarterly \nexpectations, assistance would  be provided where needed, or, the cam p may return to m onthly \nauditing if required.  The CMS would ensure that the camps graduated to quarterly audits are still \nmonitored during the period to prevent issues  from developing and remaining unchecked until \nthe next monitoring period. \n \n68  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n   \n69  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nDMH QA staff continues to us e QA f indings to inf orm trai ning needs and to developed \ncurriculum to augm ent staff skills.  QA f indings are also evalua ted on an on-going basis to   \ninform program decisions and potential staffing ad justments.  QA is routinely used to provide \nreal time feedback to program managers.  Clinicians are regularly provided face to face feedback \nbased upon the audit results and narrative summaries related to their clinical work.   \n \nDiscussion by Monitors: \n \nAs reported under the individual  provisions of this  report, the County ha s developed and is \nutilizing a number of different  auditing and reporting tools to as sist in assessing th eir progress \ntowards compliance with this Agreement.  Over time, some have been adjusted as needed.   For  \ninstance, the process involving staffing audits continues to  evolve and im prove from previous \nreports. \n \nThe County’s auditing processes for 17 and 43 are now fully developed.  The final adjustments  \nto the audit tools were made early in the monitoring period and were put in use shortly thereafter.  \nThe County consulted with the M onitor to identify the key perfor mance measures relevant to \neach provision, with a preference toward outcom es, rather than pro cess-related issues.   In  \naddition, an expected perform ance level for each  m easure was identified (generally 80%).   \nCamps falling below the expected perform ance level are required to c raft Corrective Action \nPlans designed to remediate the identified deficits.  The  Monitor reviewed several such plans \nduring the latter half of th e m onitoring period and found that  they resulted in obvious \nimprovements to practice.  \n \nIn addition, the Self-Assessment was produced with a more analytical focus than in the past.  Not \nonly did the County assemble and analyze the data, but also interpreted the meaning of identified \ntrends.  Se veral issues were flagged for additional investigation  to understand m ore about the \nunderlying causes of the problems.  The County now demonstrates all of the elements of a solid \nquality assurance program with regard to st ructured r ehabilitative  programming, behavior \nmanagement and substance abuse treatment.  \n \nWith the addition of Paragraph 73 there is a need for additional auditing and reporting tools that  \nhave yet to be fully developed or implemented.  Paragraph 73-7 is the controlling section for that  \nquality assurance component.   \n \nWe remain encouraged by the transition to outcome based audit tools.  We hope that the process \ncontinues to provide all the audi t and reporting tools necessary to allow the County to measure, \nand correct if necessary, the procedures and pe rformance required to ensure their com pliance \nwith the terms of the MOA. \n \nFull compliance will be granted when the quality a ssurance process in place  for Paragraphs 15 \nand 17 is sustained through October 31, 2014. \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n   Periodic reviews of the County’s QA and Audit Reports \n•   Consultation between the Monitoring Team and the Quality Assurance Services Bureau. \n70  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nParagraph 73: Increased Access to Community Alternatives \nTo ensure that treatment and services refere nced in the  MOA are  provided  in the least \nrestrictive setting, consistent with public safety,  the best interests of the youth, and the goal of \nrehabilitation, the County agrees to take the following steps: \n[MONITOR NOTE #1: To facilitate reporting  on  Paragraph 73, each of its component sections \nwill be individually assessed and noted in the narrative.  The assessments may contain comments \nrelated to the p rogress toward  the ind ividual s ections com pliance, however,  the actu al \ncompliance status will be determined by compliance with the entirety of the Paragraph.] \n[MONITOR NOTE #2:   Although the County init ially proposed a draft Action Plan for \nParagraph 73 two m onitoring periods ago, and indicated in the 10 th Monitoring Report that the \nplan would be com pleted in this monitoring pe riod, no final plan has yet been issued.  The \nAction Plan acts as the County’ s compliance blueprint and shoul d be finalized as soon a s  \npossible.]  \nStatus:   Partial Compliance \n \n73-1:  Minimize Juv enile Hall Confinement : The County shall re ly on juvenile ha ll \nconfinement only for youth who pose a risk to public safety and where the utilization of a less \nrestrictive environment such as home, housin g with a relative, assignment to the Community \nDetention Program, or assignment to a home that provides temporary overnight housing based \non the youth’s sta tus such as a Pre- Deten tion Alternative (for youth pending a detention \nhearing) or a Status Offender Detention Alternative (for youth who is considered to be a non- \ndelinquent status offender), is n ot appropriate . The following pre-deten tion alternatives, \nconducted by qualified staff, or local police ag encies, as appropriate, sh all be considered for  \nyouth prior to juvenile hall detention as appropriate: \n\t   Divert Minors from the Juvenile Justice  System: Local law enforcement agencies   \no\nshould consistently be encouraged to consider counsel and release for first-time, lo w-\nrisk offenders to parents, guardians, or other responsible adult in lieu of formal arrest \nand filing of criminal charges;  \n\t   Availability of Community Base d Service s: Probation  shall sche dule in- s ervice \no\ncollaborative events with local law enforcem ent agencies and introd uce them to  the \navailability of community -based services to which youth and their familie s can be \nreferred for assistance/service  in lieu of arrest and/or de tention. For example, youth \ncould be referred to the local School-Based  Probation Officer who will work with  the \nyouth and his/her fa mily and align him/her with services as well as  provide informal \nsupervision to the youth while attending school.   \n\t   Intake and Detention  Control Officers shal l, after co nducting a risk assessmen t  \no\nutilizing an evidence-based screening tool, consider the following interventions options \nfor youth: \n Cite-back and release to parents, guardians, or other relatives with a future court \no\ndate within 60 days; \n Community Detention  Program with el ectronic monitoring pending court \no\nhearing; or \n Detain in juvenile hall due to gra vity of offense, screening results, or bench \no\n71  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

Intake  \nand Detention Control (IDC) data for the ti me period of January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013 \nshows a total of 4,746 youths admitted into Juvenile Hall.  Of the 4,746 youths admitted, 467 or  \n9.8% were released prior to thei r Detention/Arraignment Hearing (Table 73.1-1), and 4,279 or \n90.2% were “Detained” into Juvenile Hall ( Table 73.1-2).  Two-thirds of released youth (67%) \nhad a low LADS risk level and nearly one-third  of released youth (30%) had a m edium LADS \nrisk level.  In the next Monitoring Period, data  regarding the subsequent  arrest and violations \nleading to detention data for these 467 releas ed youth will be analyzed. This data was com piled  \nbefore the end of the 11 th Monitoring Period but will be ana lyzed and cross-referenced with the \nrisk level of the released youth to further v erify the ability of the LADS to accurately classify \nyouth and guide detention decisions. \n \nTable 73.1-1 \nIDC Detention Decision Summary - Release \nRelease \nLADS Risk  Citation  CDP SODA/P AD   Other*   Total  Percent  \nLow  155   134   4  18   311   66.6%  \nMedium  52   80   2  4  138   29.5%  \nHigh  3  13   0  2  18   3.9%  \nTotal  210   227   6  24   467    \n*Other = Cited by Law Enforcement; Courtesy Hold/Release to Agency; Adult Custody, never brought to juvenile  \nhall; DA decline to File; WIC 602/Warrant Runaway, WIC 777 Release \n \n \nTable 73.1-2 \nIDC Detention Decision Summary - Detain \nLADS Risk   Mandatory/Legal  Probation Policy  Override   Total \nLow  1,207      (50.5%)  1,029       (56.5%)  43   2,279  \nMedium  978        (40.9%)  705         (38.7%)  24   1,107  \nHigh  205        (8.6%)  87          (4.8%)  1  293  \nTotal  2,390   1,821   68   4,279  \nPercent 55.9%  42.6%  1.5%   \n \n \nOf the total 4,279 detained youth, 2,390, or 56%, we re detained for Mandatory/Legal reasons \nsuch as an arres t bench warrant, weapons char ges, or a Welfare and  Institutions Code (W IC)  \n707(b) offense ( Table 73.1-3).  These categories m andate detention, regardless of  the youth’s \n                                                 \n3 After consultation with the Monitors and the Department  of Justice, the “LADS Validation Study” section of the \nreport was amended to include information that reflects the County’s efforts to complete the LADS Validation  Study  \nduring the 11th Monitoring  Period.  \n72 \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nscore on the LADS.  In the sam ple drawn fo r this study, over 50%  of youth detained for \nMandatory/Legal reasons scored low risk on the LADS and additional 40% scored medium risk.  \nSince these cases require secure detention, they  may further require dif ferent treatment by the  \nLADS.  Further research in the next Monitor ing Period will address whether it would be usef ul \nto re-examine the weig ht applied to this cat egory of offense on the LADS.  Probation Polic y  \nDetentions resulted in 42.6% of dete ntions during the  sample period ( Table 73.1-4).  This  \nDetention category includes past Comm unity Detention Program violations, no parent/guardian \navailable, serious threat to community, etc.  Probation Policy detentions include local, court and \ninternal Probation policies that m andate s ecure detention for youth who comm it specifi c  \nviolations or fall within specified categories. Similar to the Mandatory/Legal Detention category,  \nover 56% of youth detained for Probation Policy  detention reasons sored low risk on the LADS \nand, an additional 38% scored m edium risk.  Again, additional re search in the next Monitoring \nPeriod will address whether it would be useful to re-examine the weight applied to this category  \nof offense on the LADS. Further research and analysis could also lead to review of some of these \npolicies, particularly if subsequent arrest data  for the 467 released youth de monstrates that low  \nand medium risk youth have low arrests and violation rates. \n \nTable 73.1-3 \nMandatory/Legal Detentions (Detail) \nLADS Risk  WIC  Camp/JH \nLevel   Warrant   707(b)   Weapon  Filing  Total   Percent \nLow   669   454   49  35  1207  50.5% \nMedium   688   225   59  6  978  40.9% \nHigh   147   39   18  1  205  8.6% \nTotal   1,504   718   126  42  2,390    \n \n \nTable 73.1-4 \nProbation Policy Detentions (Detail) – Part 1 of 2 \nCommunity  Pending \nLADS  Detention  No Parent  Serious  Inter- WIC 777 \nRisk  Program   Available/  Threat to  County  Likely  (Probation  Pending \nLevel   Violation   Appearing  Community  Transfer  to Flee  Violation)   WIC 778 \nLow   469   10   70  39  10  110   13 \nMedium   252   21   71  14  4  80   4 \nHigh   13   0   0  1  0  11   1 \nTotal   734   31   141  54  14  201   18 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n73  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

These are Discretionary Overrides m ade by \nIntake and Detention Control staff, with approval by a Supervisor.  Initia lly, 556 of the original \nsample of 4,746 youth were categori zed as Discretionary Overrides.  After further analysis and \nconsultation with the Monitor, it was determ ined that 488 of the 556 were actually Probation \nMandatory Policy Detentions.  The remaining 68, or 2%, were Overrides.   This realization led to  \na two-hour booster training for IDC  staff to clarify the use of  the LADS, Probation Department \nMandatory Policy Detentions, Discretionary O verride decisions, defin itions, and procedures; \nensuring all IDC staff have the same understanding of the aforementioned. \n \nIn the 12th Monitoring Period, Ju ly 1, 2014 through  December 31, 2014, the LADS Validation  \nStudy will be com pleted.  Further exam ination and  analysis of the subsequent arrest/vio lation  \nleading to detention data for the 467 youth released in the January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013 \nsample will determine whether the LADS accurately classifies youth in terms of the likelihood to \nreoffend pending court,  fail to appear in court,   or receive a Probation viol ation that results in  \ndetention.  The subsequent arrest/violation leadi ng to detention data will be reviewed in two \ncategories: arrests prior to arraignment hearing, and arrests prior to final disposition of the case.   \nThe LADS risk level an d demographics of released youth will be examined as well, along with \nsubsequent arrest and violation data, to establish the rate of  failure among low and medium risk  \nreleased youth.  The Validat ion Study will also examine  the three override categories \n(Mandatory/Legal, Probation Policy, and Discretionary Overrides) and the associated LADS risk  \nlevels and dem ographics of the youth within  those categories.  If the LADS is shown to \nsuccessfully classify y outh accord ing to the lik elihood o f re-offense/violation p rior to the \narraignment hearing or final disp osition, then ef forts will be m ade to review Probation Policy \ndetention categories.  It is not anticipated tha t  such a review of policy will be completed within \nthe 12th Monitoring Period, due to the length of  time needed to examine such policies and seek \nbuy-in from judicial and other stakeholders. \n \nOn January 31, 2014,  Directive 1355, Juvenile-Intake and Detention Control (IDC) -\nDetained/Non-Detained Tracking Log was issued.  In February 2014, IDC began using the ID C \nDetained/Non-Detained Tracking L og at all  three IDC locations.  P er Directive 1355, the \nTracking Log is m andatory and is utilized to  record information on youth referred to IDC via   \ntelephonic contact, or brought to  juvenile hall for detention c onsideration by law enforcem ent  \npersonnel.  IDC Supervisors were trained on the Directive and Log usage and conducted on-site \n74  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nUnit training with all IDC officers beginning in April 2014 and was completed in June 2014.  All \nIDC officers were trained during this period. \n \nThe detention discussions and outcomes related to these contacts (Non-Detained and Community  \nDetention Program - CDP, Counseled and Rel eased, Referred S ervices, et c.) are bei ng  \ndocumented in the Tracking Log and reviewed by Detention Services Bureau (DSB) on a   \nmonthly basis.  In May 2014, an  IDC audit tool was develope d in conjunction with DSB to \nensure appropriate perform ance indicators woul d be m easured.  IDC audits conducted for the   \nmonths of February, March, and April 2014 revealed that every youth referred to IDC in person, \nis placed on the Log.  However, issues rega rding duplicate entries and incom plete expanded \nremarks in the appropr iate section of the Log will be add ressed through further training and \nsupervisory review. \n \nThe Audit Tools have also been designed to tr ack and capture critical perform ance measures, \nwhich include no m ore than 15% of the discre tionary cases being ov erridden.  Additional \noutcome measures will be implemented during the next Monitoring Period. \n \nAs can be seen in Figure  73.1-1 below, the Juvenile Hall population has significantly decreased \nin numbers since 2011 and we anticipate it will d ecrease even m ore as fu rther alternatives to \ndetention are explored. \n \nFigure 73.1-1  \nDSB Average Population January 2011 – June 2014 \nDETENTION  SERVICE  BUREAU  (DSB)  \nAVERAGE  JUVENILE  HALL  POPULATION  TOTALS  JANUARY  2011 ‐JUNE  2014 \n1400 \n1200 \nN \nO\nTI 1000 \nA\nL\nU 800 \nP\nO\nP\n E  600 \nG\nA\nR\nE 400 \nV\nA\n200 \n0 \nJanuary  February  March  April  May  June \n2011  2012  2013  2014 \n \n \nIntake and Detention Control data for the time period of January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014, \ninitially reflected a total of 4,124 youth adm itted into Juvenile Hall.  As shown in  Table 73.1-5  \nbelow, of that total,  127 (3.1%) had duplicate P CMS admit entries, therefore the  actual total is \n3,997.  Of the 3,99 7 youths adm itted, 476 (11.9%) were released p rior to th eir \nDetention/Arraignment Hearing, and 3,521(88.1%) were  Detained into Juvenile Hall.  That is a \n75  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

The o fficers received an overview of the Probation \nDepartment’s structure, the de linquency system, the legal basis  for detention, and the juvenile \nintake process.  Patrol officers were also provided inform ation on and the toll-free telephone \nnumber for the Probation Information Center (PIC) to provide to parents of youth.  The m eeting \non Alternatives to Detention involved partner agencies discussing the juvenile intake process and  \ncommunity based alternatives available through each agency.   \n \nThe three regional Law Enforcement Meetings were attended by a diverse representation of local \nlaw enforcem ent agencies within Los Angele s County.  Invitations and actual agencies   \nrepresented at the meetings were as follows: \n \n \t  May 29, 2014 – Law Enforcement Meeting at BJNJH (10:00 am)  \n \t  Six agencies invited  \no\n \t  Five law enforcement officers, representing three agencies attended  \no\n \n \t  June 2, 2014 – Law Enforcement Meeting at Central Juvenile Hall (10:00 am)  \n \t  Twenty agencies invited  \no\n \t  Twelve law enforcement officers, representing eight agencies attended  \no\n \n \t  June 13, 2014 – Law Enforcement Meeting at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall (10:00 am) \n \t  Twenty-five agencies invited  \no\n \t  Sixteen law enforcement officers, representing twelve agencies attended  \no\n \nThe following materials were distributed at the Law Enforcement Meetings \n \n \t  Power Point – general Probation infor mation, the reasons for m andatory (legal) detention, \ncontact information for the three IDC (Intake  and Detention Control) locations), Juvenile \nHall’s alternatives to detention, contact num ber/mailing address for the citations th at were  \nformerly sent to Informal Juvenile Traffic Court, general Probation contact number (to refer \nparents, etc. – please ask them to speak to someone in “Juvenile”), etc.  \n \t  Delinquency Flowchart/Glossary of Term s – de scribes the legal process from  a rrest to \njuvenile disposition, with an accompanying glossary of legal terms (for reference) \n \n \t  Literature – “Understanding the Risk Prin ciple:  How and Why Corre ctional Interventions \nCan Harm  Low-Risk Offenders” – includes re search regarding why low-risk offender s  \n77  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

However, the question and answer period of   \neach regional meeting varied, based on who atte nded those meetings.  Some law enforcement \nagencies specifically wanted clarification about “paperwork” required when bringing a youth to \nthe juvenile halls, while other agencies want ed to know about the new Juvenile Citation \nDiversion program.  Following these meetings, an on-going dialogue has begun that will lead to \nfurther collaboration on community  alternatives to dentation.  On  July 1, 2014, the attendees of \nthe Law Enforcement Meetings received an email link to the Resources Directory located on the  \nProbation Departm ent Inte rnet s ite.  In the  12 th Monitoring Period, July 1, 2014 through \nDecember 31, 2014, ad ditional meetings will be held with local law en forcement agencies that \nwill provide more opportunity for the Probatio n Department to encourage th e use of juvenile \nhalls as a last resort.  \n \nDiscussion by Monitors: \n \nPrior to the addition of Paragraph 73, law enforcement officers would either call the IDC first, or  \njust show up at one of the IDCs in an attem pt to have youth placed in Juvenile Hall.  W hether \ncontacted by phone or if a m inor was brought to the IDC, the intake officers utilized the LADS \nto assess whether a m inor could be released, placed  in a non-secure alternative, or if the minor \nwould be detained in the Probation system.  While law enforcement agencies were encouraged to \ncall before arriving at one of the ID Cs, their primary guidance on the phone  or at the IDC as to  \nwhether or not the juv enile would be accepted into the juvenile hall was from the conversation \nthe arresting officer had with the IDC officer.  If the decision was to not accept the juvenile at the  \nIDC, the reasons for the decision were explained to the officer, but not always documented in the \nsystem.  Those decisions should now all be do cumented in the IDC Detained/Non-Detained \nTracking Log. \n \nIn the last monitoring report, we noted that a law enforcement officer in the field could only rely \n78  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \non past experience or the evaluation of the IDC  officer to determ ine if a juvenile should be \ndiverted or detained.  If law enforcem ent of ficers are given information about other tools \navailable to them, it could allow them to m ake those initial determinations before involving the \nIDC intake officers.  There had also been some questions raised about the way the LADS wa s  \nbeing utilized at intake.  As implementation of the intake log procedures progresses, we hope to \nsee evidence in the log s of encouragement by IDC officers to get the law enforcement officers  \nwho attempt to get youth admitted to the Juvenile Halls, to consider counsel and release for low-\nrisk first-time offenders. \n \nThe Probation Department is required to schedul e in-s ervice collaborative ev ents with law   \nenforcement agencies in an ef fort to m ake  them f amiliar with available community-b ased  \nservices as an alternative to  arrest and/or detention.  The  County reports that during this \nmonitoring period it has held seven law enforcement meetings:  four with the Los Angeles Police  \nDepartment, and three regional m eetings that included different  mixes of representatives from \nthe Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and/or other local law enforcement agencies. \n \nThe Monitors of this provisi on attended the June 13, 2014 regiona l meeting at Los Padrinos \nJuvenile Hall.  We were told that the meeting we attended was similar in content to the majority  \nof the other m eetings.  Partic ipants at the m eeting were gi ven a number of handouts that \nincluded: an agenda, a printed copy of the    meeting’s PowerPoint presentation; a chart \nrepresenting the juvenile intake and related court processes with attached glossary of terms; a list \nof offenses under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 707(b); a package of forms required to \nbe completed by law enforcement for the detention of minors in juvenile hall; an article about the \nharm of correctional interventions on low-risk  offenders; and a copy of  a January 8, 2014 letter  \nto law enforcement agencies by the Presiding Judge of the Los Angeles Juvenile Court with the \nsubject identified as “Notification to Law Enforcement Agencies Regarding New Intake Process \nfor Non-Detained Juvenile Delinquency Matters.” \n \nThe subject matter of the meeting was listed as  “Probation Overview/Intake and Alternatives to  \nDetention” in both the agenda and the title slid e of the PowerPoint presentation.  The m eeting \nconsisted of the presentation, including an overview of the handout material, and a question and \nanswer period that lasted as long as long or longer than the presentation.  Despite the title of the \npresentation, the majority of the presentation related to issues other than alternatives to detention.   \nIn fact, only one of the sixteen subject m atter PowerPoint slides was devoted  to alternatives to  \ndetention.  The slide listed two bullet points  for discussion:  Commun ity Detention Program \n(CDP); and Other Community Resources. ”  Th e CDP allows a m inor to be placed in the   \ncommunity with electronic m onitoring.  Th e only listing, and discussion, under Other \nCommunity Resources was to a resource direct ory being developed by  Probation, along with \ncontact information for a Probation Bureau Chief for further information. \n \nThe discussion portion of the law enforcemen t m eeting provided no gr eater insight in to \nsuggested or available alternativ es to detention.  Instead it de volved into a com plaint session \nabout the difficulty the police agen cies had in  getting youth admitted to the juvenile halls,  and  \nthe paperwork and medical clearances required to satisfy the IDC officers.  For t heir part, the \nProbation representatives tried to address the la w enforcement complaints and to  explain the  \nnuances of the system.  The problem was that the discussion was focused on what is required to \n79  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nget youth into the juvenile  halls, not what alternatives were  available or should have been first \nconsidered by law enforcement. \n \nDuring the debriefing at the conc lusion of the m eeting the presenter advised the Monitors that \nthe discussion sessions at previ ous meetings often had a differe nt tenor, and did include m ore \ndiscussion of alternatives.  Nonetheless, the structure of the presen tation, the list of topics, and \nthe focus of the presentation the Monitors  attended, was on understanding the role of the   \nProbation Department, the legal bases for dete ntion, the process involved in the Probation \nDepartments intake decisions, and had virtually no emphasis on the availability of alternatives to \ndetention as required by this pr ovision.  It is no wonder that  the discussion period followed a \nsimilar course. \n \nThe County reports that a link to the Resource  Directory was emailed to the law enforcem ent  \nofficers that attended the seven meetings.  During the next monitoring pe riod we expect to see \ndissemination of that infor mation to all law  enforcement agencies within the County, and \nadditional collaborative events with law enfor cement that focus exclusively o r primarily on a \ndiscussion of those resources to reduce detention attempts for low-risk offenders.  \n \nIn its self-assessment for the 10th Report, the County indicated that it would use the results of the  \nLADS validation study to profile typical low and medium youth so that alternative programs can \nbe developed and marketed to law enforcement. The validation study is not yet complete, so the \nrequirements of this part of the provision have  not yet been m et. However, developing these \nprograms will be an essential  part of reducing the re liance on se cure detention for low- and  \nmedium-risk youth, as discussed in the next section.  \n  \nWith regard to the portion of this provision that pertains to  using an objective risk assessment  \ninstrument and considering alternatives to detention , the Monitor worked closely with the \nRTSB’s Bureau Chief for Detention throughout the monitoring period.  The Chief designed and \nimplemented an in-depth research project designed to address some of the questions raised in the  \nprevious Monitor’s report about the implementation of the LADS.  \n \nThe County’s self-assessm ent provides m ore substantive data in this ar ea than in past self-\nassessments and the Monitor applauds the Count y’s continuing comm itment to this endeavor. \nWhile an e arly draf t o f the se lf-assessment r evealed a s ignificant m isinterpretation of th e \ndefinition of “overrides,” subsequent conversations with the County resulted in the version of the \nself-assessment presented above. This version clearly illustrates the fact that the large majority of \nlow- and medium-risk youth are being placed into detention by overriding their LADS score via \nthe Mandatory, Policy or Discretionary override categories. This high rate of overrides seriously \ncompromises the County’s ability to ensure th at only youth for whom no less restrictive option  \nexists are p laced into d etention. In the Moni tor’s view, th e Mandatory and Policy overrid e  \ncategories are overly broad a nd should be exam ined. The De partment has indicated its \ncommitment to review the use of these categorie s and to id entify ways in which their im pact \ncould be limited. \n \nThe task of validating a risk assessm ent instrument is complex and requires expertise in the \npurpose, design and operation of structured decision-making tools. The County will complete the \n80  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nvalidation during the next monitoring period, with technical assistance from the Monitor. For the \npurpose of highlighting the salient issues to the  Parties who are not in timately involved in the  \nvalidation process, the Monitor offers the following discussion.  \n \nThe purpose of an objectiv e detention risk assessment instrument is to create  a score that is  \nindicative of a youth’s risk of failure (i.e., new   criminal offense or failure to appear) pending \nadjudication.  With the score com es a presumed “detention decision”—youth with high scores \nare presumed to require secure detention in orde r to prevent failure, youth with m oderate scores \nare presum ed to require a structured commu nity program (e.g., electronic m onitoring, day \nreporting, shelter care) to prevent failure, and youth  with low scores are presum ed to be at low \nrisk of failure even if no interventions are applied.  Whenever the actual “detention decision”  \ndeparts from the decision that is presum ed by the score, the risk score is said to be  overridden. \nOverrides usually com e in two form s—mandatory and discretionary.  Mandatory overrides   \ninclude circumstances in which the decision-makers want there to be no discretion, so that every \ntime a youth com es to detention an d one of these circum stances are present, he or s he will be  \ndetained.  Discretionary overrides include circumstances that  may suggest that the detention \ndecision should be som ething other than what  the youth’s risk score s uggests, but that the \ndecision should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the indivi dual circumstances of \nthe youth. \n \n \nThe study sample used  to validate the LADS consists of 4,746 youth \nwho were brought to Juvenile Hall for  screening between January 1 \nand June 30, 2013. Of  these:  \n   4,211 youth (89%) were detained via  Mandatory Overrides \n\t   2,390  (51%)  were  Mandatory  Detention  Overrides  \no\n\t   1,821  (38%)  were  Probation  Policy  Overrides  \no\n \t  68 youth  (2%) were detained via Discretionary Overrides \n \t  467 youth (10%) were released or placed on CDP  \n\t   238  youth  (5%)  were  released  and  cited  to  court  \no\n\t   229  youth  (5%)  were  placed  on  CDP/SODA/PAD  (non­\no\nsecure  alternatives)  \n \n \nThe County has an extensive lis t of override options.  As di scussed in the C ounty’s self-\nassessment, these include Mandatory Detention Overrides which are legislatively determined and \ninclude warrants, 707 (b) offenses, weapons-related offenses and filing  new charg es while the \nyouth is in Camp.  About one-half of the youth included in the validation study were detained via \na Mandatory Detention Override.  Although in the Monitor’s view these categories are overl y \nbroad (e.g., m any jurisdictions have effective  non-secure alternatives  to detention for youth \nbrought in on Warrants), discussions with the DOJ and the County have centered around the fact \nthat these categories are legisl atively derived and thus effort s to change them  are beyond the \nscope of the MOA.  That said, any youth whose LADS score is below the cut-point for detention \n(i.e., scores as low or m edium risk) and is  placed in d etention via one of the Mandatory   \nDetention Charges is counted among the overrides.  \n \n81  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nIn addition to the Mandatory De tention Charges, the County al so has an array of Probation \nPolicy Overrides that also require a youth to be  detained if he or she is brought to detention \nunder any of the relevant circumstances.  Fully 38% of the youth included in the validation study \nwere detained via a Probation Policy Override.   Probation exercises cons iderable control over  \nhow these catego ries are define d and utilized.  The Proba tion Policy Overrides include   \nCommunity Detention Program (EM) violations, inter-county transfers, likely to flee, probation \nviolations, re-placem ent, or pr ostitution charges.  Over one-t hird of  the youth brought to \ndetention meet one of these criteria.  Again,  the Monitor believes these categories are overly \nbroad (i.e., m any jurisdictions have effective,  non-secure options for  probation violators and \nhave found non-secure options to address th e unique need of girls invo lved in prostitution and  \nyouth with family violence), and that the County c ould significantly alter its detention practices \nby reconsidering the Probation Policy Overrides  and how youth with these circum stances could \nbe effectively managed in a non-secure setti ng.  Again, any youth whose LADS score is below \nthe cut-point for detention (i.e., scores as low or medium risk) and is placed in detention via one \nof the Probation Policy Overrides is counted as an override.  \n \nIn addition to these two Mandatory Override pathways to detention, the County also has an array \nof Discretionary Override options.  These include parents refusing custody, serious threats to \ncommunity, serious threats to m inor, pendi ng probation violations, placem ent orders, \nvictim/witness safety, likely to flee, or new arrest while on CDP. The first analysis of these data  \nindicated that approximately  13% of the youth brought to detention were detained via a \nDiscretionary Override. Subsequently, the Deten tion Bureau staff spent consid erable time and \nenergy to review the reasons for overrid es and to categorize them  into the proper category. \nSubsequent analysis resulted in  the figures presented in the  text box, above, showed that \napproximately only 2% of the validation sam ple was detained via a Discretionary Override.  In \nother words, IDC staff had been using Discreti onary categories when  one of the Mandatory \nDetention Charges or Probation Policy Overrides would’ve been more accurate. Like the Policy  \nOverrides, the County also has considerable co ntrol over how these Discretionary options are \ndefined and applied, and the Bureau’s effort to  improve the applic ation of the Discretionary \noverrides was an excellent and necessary piece of the validation effort.  \n \nAltogether, 90% of the youth in the validation study sample were detained via one of these three \nmechanisms.  Many of the youth scored as low- or medium-risk on the LADS. This is far outside \nthe generally accepted practice for the use of object ive detention screening tools, as required by \nthis portion of Provision 73. The County’s self -assessment (Tables 73.1-3, 4 and 5) clearly \nshows the frequency with which low- and m edium-risk youth are overridde n into detention. In \nthe next m onitoring period, the County also need s to review override ra tes across gender and \nrace/ethnicity to identify any disparities in  their use. While compliance with the MOA does not \nrequire immediate modifications to the various override categories, it  does require an accurate \naccounting of the cases in which the youth’s risk  score is overridden by one of these three \nmechanisms and reconsideration of how the youth’s LADS score should be used to determine the \nmost appropriate setting for yout h. As noted in the County’s self -assessment, considering ways \nthat the override categories’ impact could be more lim ited is on e of the major tasks to b e  \nundertaken in the next monitoring period.  \n \n82  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nIn terms of the validation study, which is designed to assess the outcomes of the youth who were  \nreleased from detention either via citation o r  placed on C DP, the sample has been identified \n(n=467, or 10% of the study sam ple).  Initial  data have been collected and analyzed, and \npreliminary rates of failures to appear and new criminal charges pending  adjudication have been \ncalculated.  These preliminary results were encouraging—onl y 2% of the youth who were \nreleased/placed on CDP f ailed to appear in court and 13% committed a new crim inal offense.  \nSome follow-up information is needed to ensure that the full range of non-compliant behavior is \nincluded (e.g., technical violations of CDP and  probation violations that resulted in the youth \nbeing brought to detention).  These failure rates  also need to be exam ined across risk level ,  \ngender and race/ethnicity to identify whether any  disparities exist. The County appears to be on  \ntrack to complete this study by the end of the  next monitoring period, and the Monitor will \nprovide any technical assistance needed to ensure a high-quality product. \n \nIt is worth mentioning that the Cou nty’s detention rate of approxim ately 90% means that very \nfew youth were elig ible to particip ate in the v alidation study and the results will need to be   \ninterpreted with caution.  The validation should also be replicated once the County finds ways to \nreduce its reliance on detention for low- and  medium-risk youth.  During the next m onitoring \nperiod, the Monitor will provide guidance to the  County on the analysis and interpretation of \nthese data with the goal of producing a credible validation study.  \n \nRecommendations: \n1. \t  Provide information to law enforcement agencies about the profiles of low and m edium-\nrisk youth and the community options availabl e to serve these youth in lieu of secure \ndetention through in-service collaborative event and other appropriate means.  \n2. \t  Examine differences in the application of  overrides across gender and race/ethnicity and \nmake a plan to address any disparities that are evident.  \n3. \t  Complete the analysis for the validation  study by broadening the ou tcomes to include \ntechnical violations of CDP and probation vi olations. Also, exam ine the differences in \noutcomes across risk level, gender and race/ethnicity.  \n4. \t  Draft a re port that p resents the  resu lts   of the study and highlights the various \nopportunities that exist to reduce the reliance on secure detention for youth who score as \nlow- and medium-risk on the LADS. These opportunities likely include reconsidering and \nnarrowing the categories of Policy and Discretionary Overrides, limiting how far “up” a \ncase can be overridden (e.g., a youth who scores  low risk can only be overridden from   \nrelease into an alternative) and developing additional non-secure alternative programs so \nthat IDC staff have options  for placing m edium risk youth in settings that are \ncommensurate with their risk to public safety.  \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n \t  Regional Law Enforcement Meeting at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall. \n \t  Directive 1229, “Im plementation Los Ange les County Detention S creener (L ADS)  \nAssessment Tool in Detention Services Bur eau, Intake and Detention Control,” issued \nApril 19, 2010.  \n \t  Bogue, B., R.

County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \nCourt Reports  \nDeputy Probation Officers continue to prepare  court reports that r ecommend an appropriate \ndisposition for youth in the least restrictive setting, by assessing the youth’s needs, including use \nof the Los Angeles Risk and Resiliency Ch eck-up (LARRC) Assessm ent Tool.  During this   \nMonitoring Period, the Probation D epartment drafted language to insert in Juvenile Pre-Plea, \nDisposition, 777, and 778 Court Reports that would affirm the following: \n \n \t  After considering less restrictive options , Probation  believ es ca se factors including \ncommunity safety, the deterioration of the minor’s behavior or function of the family, or the  \nfailure of intervention efforts to ac complish results have m ade it necessary to remove the   \nminor from the hom e at this tim e.  The m inor’s case was referred  to the Out- of-Home \nScreening Unit, where it was determined that  placement out of the home is in th is minor’s \nbest interests, and the minor’s case was approved for removal. \n \nThe County has always em braced the philo sophy of treating you th in their community \nenvironments, and this has been reflected in the use of risk assessments, case plans, supervision \nand treatment.  The ad dition of th is language reaffirms the County’s  commitment to seek th e \nleast restrictive settings for treatment of youth.  During the 12th Monitoring Period, this language \nwill be finalized applicable policies and procedures updated, if needed, and staff will be trained, \nif needed.  \n \nOverview of Alternatives to Incarceration for Lower-Level Offenders  \nDuring this Monitoring Period, the Resources  Directory was placed  electronically on the \nProbation Department Intranet for use by all st aff in March 2014.  In June 2014, the Resources \nDirectory was updated and placed on the Prob ation Department’s Internet site.

Four bench offi cers attended the Forum .   \nRegional Forums are conducted every four m onths in the north, south and east regions of the \nCounty.  Bench officers within that respective  geographic area are invite d and encouraged to \nattend.  During the March 28, 2014 Regional Fo rum, Probation Departm ent Executives \nemphasized that DOJ MOA Paragraph 73 is a priori ty and supports the Department’s continuing \nefforts to engage bench officers in identifying the best community alternatives to treat youth and \ntheir families.  Probation Department Executives further shared with the bench officers that the  \nresources directory is available  on the Department’s  Intranet site for use by Deputy Probation \nOfficers.  \n \nOut-of-Home Screening (OHS) Unit  \nIn June 2014, a draft Directive to supersede the current Out-of Home Screening (OHS) Directive \n1170 was in its final revision pend ing approval.  This Directive  will be implemented during the \nnext monitoring period.  It requires that  all Field DPO recommendations for CCP, Suitable \nPlacement, or DJJ be screened by OHS, without exception.  The requirement will ensure that all \nsuch recommendations comply with applicable laws and Departmental policies.  The Directive \nprovides clear and  concise criteria for the DP O recommending CCP and instructions for the \nSDPO reviewing CCP recommendations, prior to submitting referrals to OHS.  OHS will review \nall referrals in con junction with th e referring DPO for appropriateness  of the out of hom e  \nrecommendation within one (1) business day of  receiving the OHS referral.  OHS will tra ck all \nout of home referrals (CCP, Placement, and DJJ) in the OHS Unit Tracking Database, as well as \nany out of  hom e recommendations not referred   to  OHS  as  required.  For out of home   \nrecommendations not screened by  OHS as required, there is a notif ication sent to the respective \noffice Director for review, and a report of findings shall be given to the respective Bureau Chief.  \nThe OHS Database was fully im plemented prior to Provision 73.  In May 2014, an OHS audit \ntool was developed in conjunction with OHS to ensure appropriate performance indicators would \nbe measured based on the Database and PCM entr ies.  In the next m onitoring period the audit \ntool will be fully implemented.    \n \nCurrent outcome data continues to illustrate that the OHS system is functioning as intended, with \na m ajority of the youths’ best interest  being accu rately represented in each camp \n86  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

The prim ary concern \nis that the information be fully reviewed and evaluated prior to submission to the court, and that \nthe Probation recommendation to the  court represents the best and least restrictive setting for the  \nyouth consistent with public safety. \n \nWhen preparing pre-disposition court reports, Probation Officers have been directed and trained \nto recommend the least restrictive setting for youth, but the individual officers are not given the  \nauthority to make the final recommendation to the court until their recommendation is reviewed  \nand approved. Probation Department Directive 1170 mandates that the Out-of Home Screening \nUnit (OHS) is the s ingle poin t o f contact f or DPOs to clear all out-of-hom e place ment \nrecommendations prior to the submission of the c ourt reports.  The directive also requires that \n88  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nthe recommending DPO’s supervisor m ust review and approve the recomm endation prior to \nsubmission to OHS.  Once the OHS reviews and  either approves or rejects the out-of-home   \nplacement recommendation, the court report is expected to reflect that determ ination.  Prior to  \nthe previous monitoring period there had been no for mal follow-up process to determ ine if the  \nrecommendations to the courts were consistent  with the OHS decision, although the OHS had, \nand continues to receive lists of camp placements (CCP).  During the last monitoring period the \nOHS developed and implemented a review/audit process to identify violations of the directive. \n \nIt should be noted that if a court report  recommendation is consistent with the OHS \ndetermination, but the  bench officer decides differently, there is no  issue with the mandated  \nprocess.  The Probation Department, however, is concerned about cases where the DPO failed to \nclear a recommendation with OHS; ignored the OHS determination that camp placement was not \nappropriate and recomm ended CCP; or where the DPO r ecommended that the youth rem ain \nhome on probation or placed in s uitable placement, but wrote the report in a w ay, or added \nmaterials, that gave the appearan ce that camp  assignment was actually preferable leading to a \nCCP order.  The Departm ent has identified  eight categories of these inappropriate \nrecommendations that they term “exceptions.”  \n \nAudit of CCP Orders Received  \nThe OHS provided the Monitors with the resu lts of an audit of Cam p Community Placem ent \n(CCP) for the period covering Ja nuary – May 2014. For the m ost part, the process is working \nwell.  In 92% of the 670 CCP orders received  from the courts during the m onths audited, the \nCCP had been properly contacted and approved the final recommendation or found it to be okay.  \nThe remaining 8% of the cases fe ll into one of the exception  categories described above.  Of \nthose 53 ex ceptions, the greatest n umber  (52)  had not been referred to OHS prior to being \nsubmitted to the court as camp recommendations. In one c ase that had not been  submitted to  \nOHS for evaluation, the DPO recommended something less restrictive than camp placement, but  \nwrote the report in a manner that led the court to  decide on camp placement.  In two other cases, \nthe DPO recommended CCP, even though it had been expressly denied by OHS.  In the  \nremaining case, the O HS cleared the youth fo r suitable placem ent not cam p and the DPO \nrecommended suitable placement, but wrote the  report in a way that m ade camp placem ent \nappear to be a better choice.   \n \nThe audit results show that the compliance rate  with this requirement continues to exceed 90%.  \nEven more encouraging is the repo rt that in th e last two months audited the exceptions were \nlimited to 3% and 4% of the CCP orders rece ived, and the compliance rate was 97% and 96%.   \n(The Monitors were also provide d with pr eliminary audit resu lts f rom the DOJ/Quality   \nAssurance unit that showed a higher percentage  of cases “not docum ented as having bee n  \nscreened” by OHS during the sam e January – May 2014 period.  Because we utilized the OHS \naudit results in the last report, we used their audit results this time also.  We plan to discuss the  \nmatter further with the DOJ/Quality Assurance Director to determine the reason for the different  \nresults.) \n \nAs noted in the 10th Monitoring Report, the Probation Department now has a process to examine  \nwhy the m andated protocols were not followed.   The review identifies DPOs  and supervisors \n89  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \naccountable for intentional violations of the po licy and/or failure to en sure that the policy was \nfollowed. \n \nCollaboration With Courts  \nThis section of Paragraph 73 also requires the  Probation Department to  engage in an ongoing \ncollaboration with bench officers to ensure that  they are aware of community services  that are  \navailable to support a grant community-based  probation.  During this m onitoring period the \nProbation Department has continu ed to develo p an electro nic resource directory that will be   \navailable to bench officers and  staff, Probation Department staff, and possibly law enforcem ent \nagencies.  \n \nIn addition, the Probation Depa rtment and the courts are now  holding collaborative regional \nforums to address all manner of  issues between them.  They have divided the County into three \nregions for the purposes of the forums.  The County has stated their intent to hold these forums  \nfor all three regions once every four m onths, or  more frequently if needed.  In the previous \nmonitoring period, two regional forum s were held.  The third regional forum  was held during \nthis monitoring period. \n \nIn the 10 th Monitoring Report we noted that the m inutes of the two forum s held during that \nmonitoring period indicated a disc ussion of Paragraph 73, but did  not detail any discussion of  \ncommunity-based services as referenced in th is section.  The one forum  held during this \nmonitoring period focused m ore clearly on comm unity alternatives to treat youth and their \nfamilies.  The regional forum, however, was only attended by four bench officers.  The County \nneeds find additional avenues for the dissem ination of  this inf ormation if  attendan ce is  \ninadequate to meet the mandates of this provision. \n \nCamp Assessment Unit  \nDuring this monitoring period members of the monitoring team visited the CAU, reviewed their  \noperation and discussed their practices with the Director and his staff.  The Monitors found that \nthe unit con tinues to be  highly ef fective.  With the enhanced programm ing at the Ca mps, the  \ngreater emphasis on the MDTs and their use of the MDAs prepared by the CAU, our opinion has \nnot changed from prior reports. \n \nThe County is currently in partial compliance with this sub-section of Paragraph 73. \n \nRecommendations: \n   Work with courts to e nsure that the elec tronic resource directory accurately reflects \navailable services and meets their needs.  Develop a process to ensure that the reso urce \ndirectory consistently reflects currently available services.  \n   Continue the regional f orums between the courts and P robation Department to discuss \nservices available to support the granting of community-based probation for lower-level \noffender, or find som e other collaborative means to accom plish the sam e goal if \nattendance is inadequate for the dissemination of the information.  \n   Continue to audit the OHS sc reening process, and take  appropriate corrective action \nwhen violations of the policy are found.  \n90  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

If \no\nthe CCP order appears to be contrary to the youth’s treatment and se rvice needs, or if \nthe particular Camp assignment appears to be inappropriate, the case will be refer red \nback to the CAU for consideration; and \n\t   This collaborative MD T of Probation, th e Department of Menta l Health (D MH), \no\nJuvenile Court Health Services (JCHS) and Los Angeles County Of fice of Education \n(LACOE) representatives shall determine the in-Camp programming and service needs  \nof youth, and facilitate  initiation of the case p lan and community tr ansition plan for \nthe youth; \n \nEach youth’s assigned Probation Officer at the Camp shall: \n\t   Meet with the youth upon the case plan being initiated;  \no\n\t   Meet regularly (weekly) thereafter with th e youth (and the family, in person or via   \no\ntelephone or other available means, to the  extent reasonably possible consisten t with \nthe youth’s needs and /or case plan) and shall monitor and  document weekly, the \nyouth’s progress and compliance with the case plan while in Camp;  \n\t   Closely monitor the youth’s behavior and progress to determine eligibility for an early  \no\nrelease recommendation to the court to assure that youth are not incarcerated in Camp \nfor any longer than necessary. Upon the youth achieving a specific number of “made”  \ndays during which the youth was complian t with the Behavior Management Program, \nor as otherwise appropriate, the youth will be calendared  for an MDT review at the \ncamp. At the MDT, the youth’s performanc e and other factors will be considered, \nincluding post-camp community placement and service issues, and a decision will be   \nmade regarding whether to petition the cour t for an early release. Upon a dec ision \nbeing made to petition the court for early release, a Transitional MDT will be initiated;  \nand \n \t  In instances where the youth appears eligible for early release:   make the appropriate \no\nrecommendation to the court; and alert the  facility’s MDT Coordinator regarding the \npotential early release.  \n \nEach facility shall have a design ated MDT  Coordinator who shall coordinate discharge \ntransition planning. The MDT Coordinator shall: \n91  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

This \nprocess should include ensuring that thes e transition plans are cons istent with the  \nyouth’s s ervice needs,  and coord inating pr e-release co ntacts to the Camp b y the \ndesignated community Probation Officer at  least 30 days prior to the youth’s release \nfrom Camp. The Aftercare Probation Officer an d youth’s family shal l be involved in \nthe transitional MDT process to the extent reasonably possible;  \n\t   Coordinate ongoing reviews of youth confined in Camps to evaluate and identify youth \no\nwho otherwise may be eligible for early release;  \n\t   Work with all ne cessary entities a nd individuals to secure the  supports and services \no\nidentified in the you th’s re integration p lan upon the youth’s release, with more \nintensive efforts as the youth’s release date approaches. Special efforts shall be made to \nfacilitate any specialized medical or mental health service needs (including immediate  \naccess to p rescribed medications and work ing with parents/guardians to sche dule \ncontacts and appointments with mental hea lth care providers), th e initiation  or \nreinstitution of Medica id or Medi- Cal benefits upon release, school enrollmen t or \nreferrals for GED services and/or job-related assistance, as applicable.  \n\t   Coordinate the Transitional MD T process at the facility a t least 30 days prior to the \no\nyouth’s anticipated release date. \n\t   Collect and analyze monthly and annualized data regarding the number of youth \no\nidentified for early release, the number of youth actually granted early release, and the \nnumber of days these youth who were released early did not remain in custody.  \n \nA qualified Probation Officer shall conduct at least one pre-release home screening visit to the  \nyouth’s post-Camp placement within 30 days prior to the youth’s release from Camp. \n \nCounty’s Self-Assessment: \n \nIn March 2014, an In-Camp Services and Re-entry audit tool was developed to capture the MDT  \nprocess, early release eligibility, early release referrals and case work to be  used with the Camps’ \nestablished tracking logs, MDT folders, shared drive, and PCMS entries.   \n \nAudits for January through March 2014 reflected  that the Camps c ontinued to exceed \nexpectations in offering all entering youth the Initial MDT within 14 days as seen in the Figures \nbelow.  However, the  initia l aud its f or this  sam e period dem onstrated the  inconsistent \nparticipation of the Aftercare DPO.   \n \n   \n92  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nDuring the audit of the case/trans ition plan being created within  30 days of youths’ arrival in \ncamp, it was found that of the 39 sampled cases, the case/transition plan was completed 36 times \nwithin the required time frames (92%).  \n \nProvision 73-3 audits conducted for the m onths of January through March 2014, sam pled \nreleased youth for Transitional MDT participation  by the Aftercare DPO.  In the chart below for \nexample, in January 2014, nine released youth fr om the North Region had Transitional MDTs.   \nEight out of nine Aftercare DPOs were notified  of the MDT.  However, five Aftercare DPOs   \nparticipated in those M DTs.  The Af tercare DPO participation improved in all re gions for the \nsampled youth in the following month of February.  In March there was a significant drop in the  \nAftercare DPOs Transitional MDT participation in the Central and West Regions.  This may be  \ndue to several variables including small sample sizes at each individual camp.  Also, the MDTs \nwere held in samples months prior to CCTP DPO training (discussed in Provision 73-4 section) \nas recommended by the Monitors in the previous report.  In the next monitoring period, with nine \nmonths of collected data charted and the additional CCTP training and continued enforcement of \nexisting procedures, there should be a significant increase in MDT participation for all regions. \n \nTable 73.3-2  Aftercare DPO Transitional MDT Participation January through March  \n ed  h  ed  h  ed  h\notifi out otifi out otifi out\n O.N  pleY   O s %  O.N  pleY   O s %  O.N  pleY   O s % \n erCareP.   alofSam  eases  erCareP. ticipation  centage   erCareP.   alofSam  eases  erCareP. ticipation  centage   erCareP.   alofSam  eases  erCareP. ticipation  centage \nft ot el ft ar er ft ot el ft ar er ft ot el ft ar er\nA T R A P P A T R A P P A T R A P P\nJanuary  February  March \nNorth  Region  3  \nCamps   8/9  5  63%  9/9  9  100%  8/9  7  88% \nEast  region  3  \nCamps  9/9  6  67%  9/9  8  89%  9/9  8  89% \nWest  Region  3  \nCamps  9/9  4  45%  7/7  6  86%  8/8  4  50% \nCentral  Region  4  \nCamps  10/12  8  80%  8/12  8  100%  10/12  7  70% \nTotals  36/39  23  64%  33/37  31  94%  35/38  26  74% \n \n96  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

Seventeen of the 22 youth  that had ER MDTs were recommended to the \ncourt and 11 were granted early release \n \nDuring the audits, it was determined that the total number of days saved for youth released from  \ncamp early in the m onth of January 2014 was  1,904 days; in February 2014 it was 1,158 days; \nand in March 2014 it was 1,139 days for a total of 4,201 days earned.   \n \nEarly Releases  \nThe Residential Treatment Services Bureau co ntinues to ensure that youth eligible f or early  \nrelease are reviewed by a Multi-D isciplinary Team and recommended  to the court accordingly.  \nThese efforts have shown gradual increases in th e percentage of youth re leased early since the \nprogram’s implementation.  However, it is expected that the percentage will eventually stabilize  \nas early releases are depende nt upon youth’s behavior and pa rticipation in  programming (see \n100  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nTable 73.3-3 and Figure 73.3-10). Early releases during January through May 2013 yielded an \naverage of 42%, which increased in the last tw o quarters of 2013 to 51%.  An average of 50% \nwas maintained through May of 2014.  \n \nTable 73.3-3  \nYouth Released Early from Camp (January through May 2013 & 2014) \n \nCamps  # of youth  # of youth   % of youth  % of youth \n  released  released early  released  released \n  from Camp  from Camp  early (2014)  early (2013) \n \nJanuary  156  79  51%  43% \nFebruary  144  65  45%  43% \nMarch  132  71    54%  43% \nApril  168  74    44%  35% \nMay  139  77    55%  47% \nAverage  148  73  50%   42%  \n \n \nFigure 73.3-10  \nPercentage of Youth Released Early from Camp (January 2013 through May 2014) \n \n%  of  Youth  Released  Early \n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n0 \n \n \nAn Early Release audit tool was created and implemented during the reporting period in response \nto Paragraph 73-3. The tool and results of January through March 2014 audits will be discussed \nin further detail in section 73-3, In-Camp Services/Re-entry (Page XX). The Early Release \nProgram continues to benefit the County by translating into cost savings for every day a youth \ndid not reside in a County facility (See Table 73.3-4) \n101  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nTable 73.3-4  \nAmount of Time Saved by Early Releases (January through December 2013)  \n \nCamps  Time Saved   \n \nJanuary  (985 Days), 32 months; 24 Days \nFebruary  (1095 Days), 36 Months; 15 Days \nMarch  (1272 Days), 42 Months; 12 Days   \nApril    (2572 Days), 85 Months; 21 Days   \nMay    (3376 Days), 112 Months; 15 Days \n   \n \nDiscussion by Monitors: \n \nAs discussed in the County’s self-assessm ent, audit tools were drafted to assess the various \noutcomes required by this provision and a re trospective audit was conducted to assess \nperformance during January-March 2014.  This is an enorm ous improvement over the previous \nself-assessment and highlights the County’s ability to implement quality assurance procedures to  \nidentify and respond to problem s in delivering se rvices to youth.  However, the audit tools for \nsome of the Paragraph’s sections need additional refinement. \n \nRecall that the audit to ols for the other provisions in th e MOA (particularly 17 and 43) took \nseveral iterations to reach the point at which they accurately captured the performance on the key \nindicators related to the MOA and Depart ment policy.  The tim e available for such   \nreconsideration and revision has been m uch shorter for this provision, but the sam e steps are  \nproving to be fruitful.  The County is encouraged to continue the process of testing and revising \nthe audit tools until the key managers are satisfied that they capture the most useful information \nto enhance perform ance.  Towa rd that end, the Moni tors suggest a few  revisions that are \ndiscussed in detail in Provision 73-7.  \n \nThe following discussion is organ ized according to the key perform ance measures that are \nincluded in the provision and uses data collecte d and analyzed by one Monitor as part of the \nCase Presentations that were used to a ssess com pliance with Provision 17.  The Case \nPresentations involved 65 youth across 13 C amps (Ca mp Miller w as not visited due to \nscheduling reasons).  When applicable, results  from the County’s audits  are also summ arized, \nalbeit in a s lightly different fashion than as  presented in th e self-assessment.  Two additional \nMonitors responsible for parts of this section reviewed PCMS Case Notes and MDT Minutes for \n122 youth released from all Camps in March and April 2014. \n \n73-3(a) requires Ini tial MDTs to be  held with in 14 days of adm ission to Ca mp.  Overall, the \nInitial MDTs f or 61 of  the 65 you th (94%) were h eld within th e required timelines.  W hen \nexceptions occurred, th ey were us ually for  legitimate reasons (e.g., youth on medical trans ;  \nCamp evacuation).  The County’s audits revealed similar performance levels—89% of the Initial \nMDTs conducted between January-March 2014 occurred within the requirement timeline.  Only  \nCamp Gonzales and Jarvis did not reach at least an 80% compliance level.  The County’s current  \nlevel of performance meets the requirements of this part of Provision 73. \n102  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n73-3(a) also requires  Initial MDT m eetings to include Probation, D MH, LACOE and JCHS . \nAlthough the Monitor did not  capture specific data on this ou tcome measure, a review of notes \ntaken on site suggests that for the vast m ajority of the 65 youth, the  Initial MDT meetings \ninclude the participants required  by the provision.  A lthough JCHS frequently did not attend in \nperson, the MDT coordinators gene rally sought their input before  the meeting was held.  The \nCounty did not analyze data relev ant to this  position for the self-as sessment, although it is   \navailable via the m onthly audits.  The Count y’s current level of perform ance m eets the  \nrequirements of this part of Provision 73.  \n \n73-3(b) requires Camp POs to hold m eetings with youth upon case plan initiation.   Of the 65 \ncases reviewed by the Monitor, 62 (95%) reve aled a tim ely meeting between the PO and the \nyouth upon case plan initiation.  [“Timely” was defined as within 21 days of adm ission, given \nthat the MDT must be held within 14 days and then allowing an additional week for the staff to \nmeet with youth.]  This is a significant improvement over the 64% performance level reported in \nthe 10th Monitor’s Report and now m eets the require ments of this part of Provision 73.   A \nmeasure to assess the timeliness of the first meeting with the DPO of r ecord/caseworker should \nbe added to the audit tool for 73-3. \n \n73-3(b) also requires Camp POs to hold weekly meetings with youth on their caseload.  As noted \nin the discussion for Provision 17, the fre quency of PCMS entries docum enting casework \nsessions with youth has increased significantly during the current monitoring period.  Among the \n65 cases sampled by the Monitor, casework sess ions were held between the youth and the DPO \nduring 89% of the weeks  the youth were in Camp.  The Count y’s current level of perform ance  \nmeets the requirements of this part of Provision 73.  \n \n73-3(b) also requires POs to monitor the youth’s eligibility for Early Release Recommendations  \nand to file petitions reque st release as approp riate.  In all 65 cases sam pled by the Monitor \n(100%), the youth’s elig ibility for release was tracked via the num ber of Made Days \naccumulated via the M erit Ladder.  Once the m inimum threshold was  reached, MDTs were \nconvened and petitions were filed for youth who  were determ ined to be eligible for this \nincentive.  The County’s current level of perform ance meets the requirem ents of this part of   \nProvision 73. \n \nThe County’s audit data provides som e interesting comparisons across regions, which are not   \nimmediately evident as  presented in the self-assessm ent.  The table below refor mats the \npresentation of these data. \n \nEarly Release Practices, by Region \n% eligible for  % recommended for \nRegion M onth   % ER granted \nER  ER \nJan 14   70   96   91  \nCentral  Feb 14   57   88   87  \nMar 14   52   80   92  \nAverage   60%   88%   90%  \n103  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

The Monitor recommends that these \ndata be reviewed  by Camp to refine the understanding of why  these differences exist.  First, \nyouth who are in Cam p on a 3-month program are  not eligible for early release.  Sim ilar \nproportions of eligible youth we re observed in Central (60%),  East (63%) and West (65%) \nregions, with higher proportions of  eligible youth evident in the North (79%).  Onc e the MDT \nreviews the youth’s Made Days, program  completion, education status  and recent behavior, a \ndecision is m ade about whethe r to recomm end the youth for  early release.  Although Camps   \ndependably review every youth for early release, as they are required to do by this provision and \nby Provision 17, there are wide disp arities in the  proportion of youth  recommended for early  \nrelease.  The East and North recommended  60% of the eligible youth, while the W est  \nrecommended only 46% and Central recommended 80% of the eligible youth.  These differences \nare ripe for further rev iew to determ ine whether there are differences  in the rate of program \ncompletion, standards for recommendation, etc.  across the Cam ps.  Fi nally, most regions \nexhibited a high rate of  approval for early re lease recommendations (Central 90%; East 98%; \nWest 100%), with m ore moderate rates in the  North (74%).  The gr ant rate is likely due to \ndifferences in judicial philosophies about such things, but again,  these data should be generated \nat the Camp level to better  understand the differences (e.g.,  the region with the lowest \nrecommendation rate, West (46%) had the highest approval rate (100%), which may indicate the \nCamps in that region only recommend youth who are a “sure thing”).  None of these differences \nwill be particularly meaningful absent a Camp-level analysis.  \n \n73-3(c) requires the facilities to initiate the youth’s transition plan within 30 days of t he youth’s \narrival at Camp.  Each Camp visited by the Monitor was asked to describe the initial steps taken  \nto create the transition plan for each of the 65 youth in the Case Presentation sample.  Uniformly, \nthis consisted of determining whether the youth would be released  to his/her home or would go \nfrom Camp to Placem ent.  If  the youth was expected  to go to Placem ent, contact with the \n104  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nPlacement Unit was established. If the youth was expected to return home, the school district in \nwhich the youth would enroll was identified. This information is documented on the Initial MDT \ndocuments for each  youth.  The Co unty’s audits reveals a 90% perform ance level acros s all \nCamps for the three-month period, with only Me ndenhall, Gonzales and  DKC not meeting the \n80% threshold.  The County appears to meet the requirements of this part of Provision 73.  \n \n73-3(c) also requires a Transiti onal MDT to be held at least 30 days prior to the youth’s \nanticipated release date.  Among the youth included in the Ca se Presentations, the Transitional \nMDT was held at least 30 days be fore the youth’s release date in 63  of the 65 cas es sampled \n(97%).  The other two youth were released earlier than anticipated and so the Transitional MDT \nfell inside the 30-day window.  Even when this occurred, all of the supports and services needed \nto encourage a successful re-entry were in place prior to the youth’s early release.  The County’s \ncurrent level of performance meets the requirements of this portion of Provision 73.  \n \n73-3(c) also requires the Aftercare PO and youth’s family to be involved in the transitional MDT \nprocess to the extent reasonably possible.   Mem bers of the monitoring team  assessed \nparticipation in Transitional MDT m eetings for each of the 65 youth involved in the Case \nPresentation sample, and also through a review of PCMS Case Notes and MDT Minutes for 122  \nyouth released from  the cam ps during March  and April 2014. The Aft ercare/Placement PO  \nparticipated, either by phone or in person, in  only 90 of the 122 m eetings (74%) documented in \nthe Case Notes and Minutes.  The Aftercare/Pl acement PO participated, either by phone or in \nperson, in 78% of the Transition MDT meetings reviewed in the Case Presentation sample.  This  \nis a significant im provement over the 62%  performance level repo rted in the 10 th Monitor’s  \nReport.  Camps with more pers istent Transitional MDT Coordinators appeared to have grea ter  \nsuccess obtaining Aftercare PO par ticipation.  Participation  rates were also h igher at Cam ps  \nvisited toward the end of the monitoring period, as the new procedures had been in place longer.  \n \nThe County’s audits reviewed cases from the beginning of the monitoring period and found that \nthe APO participa ted in the trans itional MDT m eeting in only 63% of the cases.  This is   \nconsistent with the M onitors’ review of the March and April PCMS Case Notes and MDT \nminutes for APO in-person participation in th e Transitional MDT.   When telephone/video \nparticipation was included, that  number increased to  74% compliance.  In  the County’s audit, \nonly 3 Camps met or exceeded 80% compliance: McNair, DKC and Scott.  The County needs to  \nincrease Aftercare PO participa tion in Transitio n MDTs in order to comply with this part of   \nProvision 73.   Given the timeframe for these audits (early 2014), the Monitors anticipate that the \nobserved level of performance in the second half of 2014 will be significantly improved.  \n \nThe County’s audits also found that the family attended the Transition MDT in 76% of the cases.  \nThe Monitor noted that the family was invited to attend 100% of the MDTs but often could not \nattend because of wor k schedules or geographi cal distance.  The County’s current level of \nperformance appears to meet the requirements of this portion of Provision 73.  \n \n73-3(c) requires a home visit within 30 days  of the youth’s anticipated release from  Camp.  Of  \nthe 65 Case Presentation, 58 youth were returning home.  A home visit was conducted within 30 \ndays of the youth’s release in 54 of the 58 cases (93%).  The March and April PCMS Case Notes  \n105  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \ndocumented the required hom e evaluations were  timely conducted in 118 of 119 cases (99%).   \nThe County is meeting the requirements of this part of Provision 73.  \n \n73-3(c) requires the MDT team to secure th e necessary supports and services identified in the  \nyouth’s reintegration plan.   The Transition Plans for each youth were summarized  during the \nCase Presentations.  In all cases (100%), the transition plans contained the required components, \naddressing the youth’s living situation, m ental health needs (e.g., counseling or substance abuse \ntreatment), and medical needs (including prescription drugs, as applicable).  Camp Headquarters \nautomatically forwards information to parents for how to enroll/re-enroll youth for Medicaid and \nMediCal benefits.  DMH aftercare specialists were involved in the transition planning for many \nof the youth.  Each f acility also has a LA COE transition liaison who provides contact \ninformation for the school district in which the  youth will enroll.  [The  district selects the \nspecific school the you th will atten d.]  W hen the youth w as a special education s tudent, the  \nLACOE representative also notified the distri ct’s Special Education Office of the youth’s \nupcoming release.  The County appears to be mee ting the requirements of this part of Provision \n73. \n \n73-3 requires the County to collect and analyze data regarding the number of youth identified for \nearly release.  The County’s self-assessm ent provides  detailed information on the num ber of \nyouth identified for early release. The Monitor  discussed these same data in Provision 17 and \nalso presented the data above in the section th at discusses early release consideration.   The  \nCounty is meeting the requirements of this portion of Provision 73. \n \nRecommendations: \n1.\t   Increase Aftercare PO participation in Transitional MDTs.  \n2.\t   Interpret the differences in e arly release practices that are eviden t across region s by  \ndrilling down to the Camp level and invest igate the underlying causes of the diffe ring \npractices.  \n3.\t   Continue to refine audit tools to m easure current performance levels on each of the key \nperformance measured required by this pr ovision. Require corrective action plans in \nthose cases where observed performance levels do not meet expectations.  \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n\t   Site v isits to Cam ps Aff lerbaugh, Paige,  Rockey, Onizuka, McNair, Jarvis, S cott, \nScudder, DKC, Kilpatrick, Gonzales, Munz and Mendenhall. \n\t   Case Presentations of 5 youth most recently released at each Camp, along with the source \ndocumentation, total sample = 65 youth \n\t   Data culled from audits of 73-3 covering January through March 2014 \n\t   Extensive consultation with Probation and DMH administrators and other staff involved \nin the design and implementation of aftercare protocols. \n\t   Review of PCMS Case Notes and MDT Minutes for all Camp releases during March and \nApril 2014. \n \n   \n106  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

On-\nsite training was conducted a nd completed at the nine (9)  CCTP area offices March 25 – 28, \n2014.  In April 2014, an audit tool was developed with CCTP with a majority of the performance \nmeasures paralleling the Tracking Form.  The tool is also designed to track appropriate case note \nentries in PCMS regarding contact with youth  and service providers.   In May 2014, additional \nrefresher training was held with all CCTP staff  to review the Tracking Form as it r elates to this \nportion of Provision 73.  All CCTP supervision DPOs are now aware of the require ment, when \nnotified, to participa te in both the  Initial MDT and the Transitional MDT either in-person, \nconference call, or video conference.  CCTP DPOs failing to participate in the MDT must notify \n107  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \ntheir Supervisor and docu ment the reason in PCMS.  This m ay allow enough notification tim e  \nfor an alternate DPO to attend the MDT.  Ho wever, the assigned DPO must have o ne face-to-\nface meeting with the youth at least 21 days prior  to release to d iscuss their tran sitional case  \nplans.  Additionally, CCTP DPOs are also requir ed to document, in PCMS, f amily contacts in \nwhich the youth’s case plan was  discussed.  CCTP DPOs are requi red to perform at least one \nhome visit and one school visit within 30 days of the youth’s release, in addition to meeting with \nyouth bi-monthly once they are released from camp.        \n \nFigure 73.4-1   CCTP MDT Participation (Source:  CCTP) \n160 \n140 \n#  of  Initial  MDTs \n120 \n100 \nParticipation  of  Initial  \nMDTs \n80 \n#  of  Transitional  MDTs \n60 \n40  Partip  Trans.  MDTs \n20 \n0 \nJan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  June \n \n \n \nTable 73.4-1 CCTP MDT Participation  \n  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May   June  Total \n               \n# of Initial MDTs  74  65  83  109  114  78  523 \nParticipation Initial MDTs  35  36  51  74  78  60  334 \n# of Transitional MDTs  153  145  110  123  107  111  749 \nParticipation Transitional  104  100  86  102  91  101  584 \nMDTs \n               \n \nIn April 2014, an audit of CCTP fo r the months of January and February 2014 was co mpleted. \nThe data sample was generated based on the youths’ Transitional MDTs and not their re lease \ndates.  For the tool to  work in conjunction  with the DPO Tracking Form , the youth m ust be \nreleased from camp for at least thirty (30) days.  During the next monitoring period the data will \nbe collected only on  released minors for the rem ainder of 2014.  The  audit findings concluded \nthat there were 121 Transitional MDTs held for youth released to CCTP during the audit months \n(January and February 2014).  Of the 121    Transitional MDTs held, the CCTP o fficers \nparticipated in 107, which 82 were face-to-face  participation.

There were 99 out of 121 cas es that the CCTP Officer docum ented having a \nface-to-face meeting with youth an d family within three working days post cam p. There were \nalso 65 out of 121 cases that the CCTP officer  documented home visits within 30 working days \npost youth’s camp release.  The CCTP trainings in  April in May were in part, to reinforce the \nrequirement that home visits are to be made within 30 days of release, and to decrease the lack of  \ndocumentation on the Tracking Form of services provided.   \n \nThere was  additional data collected during the  audit period (January and February 2014)  in  \nwhich PCMS was utilized as the primary source to locate data for sample cases.  After the review  \nof ten sam ple cases of  youth released to CCTP,  it was found in ten out of ten  cases that  the \nyouths’ transition plan was documented in PCMS as consistent with their s ervice needs. There \nwere ten out of ten cases that the C CTP officer referred the youth to aftercare services, and ten  \nout of ten cases that included documentation of enrollment in services. There were also ten out of  \nten cases that the CCTP officer docum ented the  youth’s behavior and progress with the case \nplan.  There were seven out of ten cases that  the CCTP of ficer maintained contact with the  \ncommunity service provider.  During the next monitoring period CCTP will reassess and revise, \nwhere necessary, their Tracking  Form and train  all CCTP officers on  its proper usage.  Th e \nCCTP audit tool will also be  reassessed to ensure the Tracking Form and CCTP PCMS entries  \nare capturing the appropriate performance measures.                                                                                                \n \nIn May 2014, The Intensive Gang Supervision Program (IGSP) Managem ent and CCTP \nManagement held a P 73 joint-training session for supervisory staff, in which IGSP was   \n109  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nintroduced to the CCTP DPO Tracking Form .  Prior to this training in May, IGSP was alr eady  \ninvolved in m any of the Provision  73 requirem ents.  IGSP officer s were participating in the   \nTransitional MDTs for youth identifi ed to be released to their  program.  IGSP officers have \nalways maintained enhanced field supervisi on of identified youth in the community through \nregular home visits, family contacts, school visits and service provider contacts.  The join t \ntraining included information on development and completion of the Tracking Form, utilization \nof the shared drive, and requirement that IGSP officers attend the Initial MDT when a new camp  \nyouth (not previously assigned to IG SP) has been identified to be released  to their supervision.  \nIn June 2014, IGSP was added to the CCTP shared drive.  Also in June 2014, IGSP and the DOJ  \nBureau developed a draft audit tool, and recognized the need to develop an IGSP Tracking Form.  \nBy the next m onitoring period, both the T racking Form and audi t tool will be finalized and \nimplemented.                                                                                                                                                              \n \nProvision 73-4 requires that a Residential Ba sed Service (RBS) Officer assig ned to the \nPlacement Administration Services Office (PAS) attend Transitional MDTs of youth that, absent  \nidentification of a suitable hom e in the comm unity, may be transitioning to Placem ent upon \nrelease from camp. In April 2014, a Placem ent audit tool was developed in  collaboration with  \nPlacement Services Bureau (PSB) to be used  in conjunction with PC MS case no tes and their  \npreviously implemented PSB Transition Process Tracking Form (2013).  Audits for  the months \nof January – June, 2014 captured data on the RBS  officers’ participation in Transitional MDTs. \nThe data fin dings concluded that th ere were 34 Transitional MDTs held  for youth released to \nPlacement during the Audit months (January-June 2014). Of the 34 Transitional MDTs held, the  \nRBS officers attended 12. However, further review of the data suggested that limitations with the \nRBS officers’ participation in the T ransitional MDTs can be attributed to 20 of the 34 youths’ \nTransitional MDTs being held  prior to the initial pla cement order.  Therefore th e RBS officer  \nwould not have been expected to participate in the initial MDT.    \n \nAdditional data was collected  during the Audit peri od (January – June 2014) in which PCMS \nwas utilized as the prim ary source to locate da ta for the audit sam ple cases. The PCMS case \nnotes were reviewed to verify the RBS officer s’ involvement with providing continuum of care \nto youth and their families.  Thirteen sample cases indicated that 11 out of 13 cases demonstrated \nthe RBS officer documented in PCMS the youths’ service needs and transitional plans.  Also, 11 \nout of the 13 cases inv olved the RBS officer  explaining the Placem ent process to the youth \nand/or family. There were 12 out of 13 cases that included coordination with the RBS officer and \nZero Incarceration Placem ent Program (ZIPP) unit reg arding youth’s placem ent needs. There \nwere 11 out 13 cases that the RBS Officer com pleted a face-to-face visit within seven days of \nyouth being released.  Although, the tool has been  implemented it will be reassessed before the  \nnext monitoring period, to ensure it is capturing all of the substantive data for Provision 73.    \n \nDiscussion by Monitors: \n \nThe supervision of m ost youth released from   Camps falls within the purview of  the Cam p  \nCommunity Transition Program.  A portion of youth released to the community report to P Os \nassigned to the schools the youth attend or, if they had been heavily involved in gang activity, to \nspecialized Gang POs.  Until rece ntly, f or th e purpose  of  providin g the in-ca mp af tercare \nservices, CCTP took the lead for all these youth.  A small number of youth released from Camps \n110  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \ngo directly to placem ent in a  group home or som e other for m  of non-family setting.  The \naftercare POs for these youth are assigned to th e Placement Unit.  At som e point during this \nmonitoring period each separate un it was made responsible for pr oviding the aftercare services \nrequired by this provision for youth to be assigned to them at the conclusion of the youths’ camp \nprograms. \n \nPrior to the addition of Paragra ph 73, CCTP staff were not expected  to participate in transition  \nplanning for youth until the Transitional MDTs, and  then only if reasonably possible.  If they \nwere able to particip ate, it was generally by telephone.  Now, a ftercare POs are required to \nparticipate in, and take a greater role in the transition planning of those youth.  In addition to the \nTransitional MDT, section 73-4 requires after care POs to conduct at  least two pre-release \nmeetings with the youth (at least one of which is  face-to-face, where reasonably possible, or by \nvideo conferencing if necessary) at  least 21 days prior to their release dates.  They are als o  \nrequired to coordinate with the yo uth’s family (or comm unity placement) to ensu re that the \nfamily is aware of the release date, the transition plan, and the youth’s service needs. \n \nAs noted in  previous monitoring reports, th e County comm itted to in creasing the num ber of \nCCTP aftercare probation officers in an effort to reduce officers’ caseloads to a point where they  \ncould become more engaged in the transition planning as requi red by this provision.  Although \nthere has been im provement, the level of co mpliance w ith this portion of Paragraph 73-4 \ncontinues to be inadequate. \n \nThe Monitors reviewed PCMS Case  Notes and MDT Minutes for 122 youth released from  the \nCamps during March and April 2014.  Of the 122 cases reviewed where aftercare services would  \nbe required, the required level of pre-release contact between the youth and the aftercare PO was \nobserved in only 60% of the cases.  While a huge improvement over the 15% compliance rate of \nthe prior monitoring period, it still falls shor t of the compliance required.  [The level of \nparticipation by APOs during Camp stays vari ed widely.  Although the required m inimum \nnumber of contacts overall was insufficient, some APOs conducted many more than the required \nminimum number of contacts with the youth.  That is an encouraging sign.] \n \nAftercare POs are also required to ensure that the families of youth about to be released from the  \ncamp system are aware of the release and transition planning.  This can be done at any time, but \nis probably easiest when the aftercare PO and fa mily participate in th e Transitional MDT, or \nwhen the PO conducts the pre-release home inspection.  The Case Notes  did not always clearly \nstate if the discussions held at  either the TMDT or the pre- release home inspection involved a \ndiscussion of the transition proce ss, but this appears to be more of documentation failure rather \nthan a compliance issue.  \n \n73-4 requires that the APO conduct an in-person meeting with the youth and the youth’s fam ily  \nwithin three working days of the youth’s release from Camp.  Based the March and April Case \nNotes review, this occurred in 107 of the 114 applicable cases (94%). \n \nThis provision does not set a m inimum number of  regular face-to-face visits the aftercare POs \nare required to have in the community to monitor youth behavior and progress, yet it is left to the \nMonitors to determ ine if the  County is in complia nce w ith the provision.  During initial \n111  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \ndiscussions with the Monitors, the P robation Department had set an internal requirem ent of one  \nmeeting per week with the youth and/or fam ily.  That m ay have  been overly am bitious \nconsidering the addition al contact requirem ents placed on the APOs.  During this monitoring \nperiod the County provided the Monitors with a  draft CCTP manual.  The draft manual requires \nthe aftercare PO to  “(m)ake contacts with the m inor and pa rent/caregiver per CCTP CASE \nMANAGEMENT STANDARDS (two times per month in person.  At least one visit should be in \nthe field.)”  We concur with the County that a standard of one contact approximately every other  \nweek, or two times a month would be sufficient in the average case.  \n \nThe first month or two after release from Camp are critical to a youth’s successful transition into  \nthe community. We reviewed files for March a nd April 2014 releases.  W e chose that tim e  \nperiod to ensure that all the files reflected a  minimum of eight weeks from  the time of release \nuntil the records were pulled for Monitoring review. \n \nSome of the case files reviewed by the Monitors  were for youth who were released from  formal  \nprobation at, or shortly after release, and so me who were releas ed   to probation in other \njurisdictions.  Only 102 of the files reviewed for March and April Camp releases involved youth \nwho rem ained in the aftercare system  long  enough for analysis.  The PCMS Case Notes \ndocument 69% of the March cases and 58% of  the April cases m eeting the twice a m onth \nmeeting requirement.  Those numbers m irror our review of November and Decem ber cases  \nduring the last m onitoring period, but fall far short  of the rate required for compliance at this  \npoint in the monitoring process. \n \nThe Case Notes rev iewed by the  Monitors were  replete with entries re lated to referrals  to \ncommunity programs and providers  as required by the individual cas e plans, contacts with the \nschools and other providers, and entries by providers that had access to the PCMS system.  This \npart of this section is satisfactory. \n \nAftercare POs are required to  conduct a hom e visit within 30 da ys of a youth’s release from \nCamp.  Although some Gang and CCTP aftercare DPOs conducted many home visits, the overall \ncompliance level for this part of 73-4 is insuffi cient.  In 27 of the applicable 105 cases (26%)   \nthere was no documented home visit.  In 15 of  the 105 cases (14%) the ho me visit was outside \nthe 30-day window.  In only 63 of the 105 cases (60%) was the home visit timely conducted and \ndocumented as required. \n \nThe youth and family meeting and PCMS recording requirements are no longer new to aftercare  \nProbation Officers who received training related to this portion of the MOA during the previous \nand current monitoring period.  The Department now has a tracking form that identifies the key \nareas described above, but the auditi ng and reporting related to them  is still a work in progress.   \nWe look forward to the refinem ent and utilization of the audit  tools that will track com pliance \nand lead to corrective action where deficiencies are noted.   \n \nAt this tim e, the County is in partial com pliance with the requirem ents of this sub-section of \nParagraph 73. \n \n   \n112  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nRecommendations: \n   Increase the involvem ent of aftercare Proba tion Officers in the pr e-release transition \nprocess. \n   Ensure that aftercare POs meet the minimum pre-release meeting with youth set forth in \nthis section, and that those meetings are properly documented. \n \t  Ensure that aftercare POs m eet with fam ily or community placem ent in advance of a \nyouth’s release to assure awareness of the release date and tr ansition plan, and that those \nmeetings are identified as relating to transition planning in the PCMS Case Notes.. \n\t   Ensure that aftercare P Os conduct a hom e visit within 30 days af ter a youth’s release \nfrom Camp. \n\t   Ensure that all staff and supervisors that  have contact with  youth, and/or service \nproviders related to those youth, properly document those contacts and their observations  \nand recommendations in the Case Notes.  \n \t  Refine necessary audit tools, and report on results and corrective action. \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n   Review of PCMS Case Notes and MDT Minut es for all camp releases during March and \nApril 2014. \n   Meetings with the CCTP and DOJ/QA Directors and staff. \n \n73-5:  Community-Based Alternatives to Incarceration: The County shall ensure the \navailability of, and referral to, a continuum of community-based alternatives to incarceration, \nin sufficient capacity throughout the County to serve all appropriate youth in their \ncommunities of residence, including, but not limited to, youth with disabilities and youth with \nmental health needs, to the extent reasonably possible, consistent with the County’s goals of \nensuring the public safety and rehabilitation of youth. \n \nThe County Probation Department shall ensu re the  availability of the following  services to  \nenhance youth’s access to community-based alternatives: \n\t   Probation services, in a range of supervision levels, commensurate with the risk posted \no\nby youth, and a sufficient number of adequately trained staff to facilitate the youth’s \ncase plan; \n\t   non-secure residential services, including supervised independent living pro grams,  \no\nrespite, specialized foster  care, and group homes; and  \n\t   three (3) individual Day Reporting Centers (“DRCs”) to serve youth in the community. \no\nOne (1) DRC is currently open and an additional two (2) DRCs will be opened. \n \nThe County Probation Department shall take all reasonable steps to refer youth to community-\nbased services that are outlined in a youth’s case plan.

Community superv ision options include, \nbut are not limited to: \n \n \t  Juvenile Supervision  Deputy Probation Officers (DPOs)  supervise juveniles placed on \ncommunity-based probation supervision.  DPOs  assigned to designated communities provide \ncase management services (e.g. assessment, orientation, contacts, service referrals, violations, \ncourt reports,) and work with minors, families, schools and other relevant resources to build  \non m inor/family strengths, evaluate and m ake efforts to m inimize risks and monitor \ncompliance with court orders.  \n \n \t  School Based Supervision consists of programs that serve youth and families within the five  \nSupervisorial Districts. The program s and services are funded through the Juvenile Justice \nCrime Prevention Act (JJCPA) designed to pr ovide a full spectrum  of comm unity-based \nservices to both probation and  at-risk youth. The school based  program consists of Deputy \nProbation Officers (DPOs) assigned to High schools, Middle schools, Housing Developments  \nand Park (afterschool enrichment) sites. \n \n\t   Juvenile Dual Supervision (DS) Program supervises minors under the legal jurisdiction of the \nDepartment of Children and Fa mily Services (DCFS), through Dependency Court who are   \nplaced on probation.  Minors receive case supervision from both DCFS and Probation.   \n \n\t   601 Intake Deputy Probation Officers (D POs) are assigned to geographic areas that overlap  \nexisting field service area office boundaries. In take DPOs are responsible for responding to \nreferrals for m inors exhibiting behavior probl ems such as incorrig ibility, truancy, running \naway, and other pre-delinquent conduct. Referra ls may be initiated by parents, schools, \nProbation, public, private or community agencies. \n \n\t   Intensive G ang Supervision Program  provides intensive supervision of gang identified \nprobationers and aim s to protect the commu nity by closely m onitoring a probationer’s \ncompliance with the term s and conditions of probation.  IGSP Deputy Probation Officers \n(DPOs) work with school officials, co mmunity based organizations, the probation \ndepartment’s specialized units and law enforcement agencies. \n \n\t   Camp Community Tra nsition Program provides after-care services for youth trans itioning \nfrom camp back into their own comm unities.  The services begin pr ior to their  release, \nfollowed by a 30 to 60- day intensively supervised transition period to ensure prom pt school \nenrollment, community service and partic ipation in selected program s provided by \ncommunity-based organizations until termination. \n114  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \t  Division of Juvenile Justice Unit  Deputy Probation Officers (D POs) supervise juveniles \nplaced on comm unity-based probation supervis ion after being released  from the State of   \nCalifornia’s Division of Juvenile  Justice.  DPOs assigned to this unit work closely with the  \nProbation Departm ents Special E nforcement Op erations to provide case m anagement  \nservices (e.g. assessm ent, orientation, contacts, service referra ls, violations, court reports,) \nand assist probationers in reintegrating back into the community.  \n \n\t   Residential-Based Services Deputy Probation Officers are res ponsible for case management \nand monitoring of youth ordered suitably placed  by the Juvenile Court in placem ents.  \nSeventy (70) RBS Deputy Probation  Officers work with the youth and fa milies to identify  \nareas of strength and risk in order to deve lop appropriate case plan to ensure prom pt  \nreunification and/or permanency. \n \n\t   Placement to Community Transitio n Services supports fam ilies as youth trans ition home  \nfrom out-of-home care settings  and provides intensive in-home supervision and treatm ent  \nservices utilizing Functional Fam ily Probation (FFP) Supervision and/or Functional Fa mily  \nTherapy (FFT) and provides li nkage to W raparound Services.  PCTS also provides these \nservices to youth ordered “Home on Probation” in an effort to  prevent eventual out of home  \nplacement. \n \n\t   Youth Development Services and E xtended Foster Care  provides supportiv e services to \ntransition age youth ex iting foster care in an e ffort to pro vide foster care youth with th e \nnecessary skills, experiences, and assistance to  ensure self-sufficiency, productivity and well-\nbeing. \n \nThe County utilizes sev eral means to ensure that community resources are m aximized for the \ntreatment of youth, including but not limited to the following: \n \n\t   Prospective Authorization and Utilization Review Unit (PAUR) Unit identif ies appropriate  \nEBP interventions, such as; W raparound, F unctional Fam ily Therapy, Multi-System ic \nTherapy, Family Preservation, Group Home Aftercare Services, Substance Abuse Prevention \nand Control Services, and Functional Fam ily Probation, with the goal of referring the youth \nto these program s in lieu of rem oval from the hom e.  These program s divert youth fro m  \nincarceration and work with the you th’s family to address the issues that are influencing the  \nyouth’s delinquent behavior. \n \n \t  Out-of-Home Screening (OOHS) Unit  reviews recommendations of Deputy Probation \nOfficers to remove youth from the comm unity.  This Unit ensures youth are referred to the \nleast res trictive resid ential altern ative appr opriate to th eir risk and  needs in cluding: \nsupervised independent living program s, respite care, specialized foster care, and  group  \nhomes.   \n \n\t   High Risk/High Needs Home-Based Program provides for youth between the ages of 14 and \n17 an intensive family-centered, home-based service intended to avert an ongoing escalation \nof criminal and delinquent behavior and to  promote school success, to high-risk youth and \n115  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \ntheir families.  These support services are designed to effectively strengthen the family unit,  \nwhile fostering parenting practices, prom oting responsible youth beha vior, and decreasing \ndelinquent activities and recidivism.   \n \n \t  High Risk/ High Needs Employment Services Program offers services to youth between the \nages of 16 and 18.  The services are in tended to increase job readiness and job \nplacement/retention with an aim toward incr eased youth  e mployment that can  lead to   \nsuccessful career paths.  \n \n\t   Educational Pathways and Vocational Opportunity Services , for youth between the ages of \n16 and 17, provides services to “credit deficient” probation youth before their eighteenth (18) \nbirth date.  The serv ices are intended to increase the number of participants receiving their  \nGeneral Equivalency Diploma (GED) while completing a Career Technical Education (CTE) \nprogram. \n \n \t  Substance Abuse Refe rral, Southern Ca lifornia Alcohol & Drug Program  Services are for  \nyouth betw een ages 12 and 18, providing Outp atient Substance Abuse treatm ent that \nincludes: random  weekly test ing, individual/group counseli ng, and an evidence based \ncurriculum at locations throughout the County. \n \n \t  Substance Abuse Treatment Program, as part of the Juvenile Justice Crim e Prevention Act \n(JJCPA) is afforded to youth between the ages  of 12 and 17.  Youth  are provided with the \nskills to resist continued substance abuse use and the associated negative behaviors with the \ngoal of reductions in subsequent arrests, in carceration, and probatio n violations and an \nincrease in com pletion of probation, restitution, and community se rvice requirements, by  \nparticipating youth. \n \nJuvenile Day Reporting Centers  \nDuring this Monitoring Period, the County m aintained the operation of the Van N uys Juvenile \nDay Reporting Center (JDRC).  Youth referred to the Van Nuys JDRC are between the ages of \n14 to 17 and score m edium to high risk on th e Los Angeles Risk an d Resiliency Check-Up \n(LARRC) risk assessment tool.  An average of  15 youth participate in the six-week treatm ent  \nprogram.  During the school year, the program  operates from 3:30 pm t o 7:00 pm.  During the \nsummer, the program operates from 9:00 am to 3:30 pm. \n \nThe East Los Angeles Juvenile Day Reporting  Center’s (JDRC) Agreem ent was executed \neffective May 1, 2014, with an Orientation held for parents and youth on June 27, 2014.  Eleven  \nparents attended the Orientation.   The East Los Angeles JDRC  targets medium to high risk \nyouth, ages 14 to 18.  With a capa city of up to  60 youth, this JDRC offers a full academ ic \nprogram and the following services: \n \n   Academic Credit Recovery \n   Academic Counseling/Vocational Advisement \n   Tutoring Services \n   Linkages to Support Services \n116  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.

As of June  30, 2014, one Se nior Probation D irector, one \nDirector, one Supervising Deputy Probation O fficer, and one Deputy Probation Officer are on \nstaff.   Nine  youth have been transferred to the East  LA JDRC.  Academ ic teachers and other \nsupport services are in place at the East Los A ngeles JDRC.  As Probation youth are stabilized   \nacademically and progress through other requirements, they will have the option to return to their \ntraditional school.  \n \nThe Lynwood Juvenile Day Reporting Center’s Ag reement was executed effective July 1, 2014.   \nPrior to this date, an O rientation was held for parents an d youth on June 24, 2014.  Eleven \nparents attended the Orientation.  The Lynwood JDRC targets m edium to high risk youth, ages \n14 to 18.  With a capacity of up  to 60 youth, this JDRC offers a  full academic program, mental \nhealth, substance abuse and cognitive treatm ent services. Eleven youth are enrolled in the \nLynwood JDRC.  The four classrooms are under renovation and will be fully operational early in \nthe 12th Monitoring Period, and on time for the start of the regular academic year.  As of June 30, \n2014, one Senior Probation Direct or, one Director, one Superv ising Deputy Probation Officer, \nand one Deputy Probation Officer are on staff. \n \nDiscussion by Monitors:  \n \nA review of case notes and files of  youth releas ed from Camps in both the prior and current \nreporting periods, discu ssions with aftercare  officers assigned to Gang,  CCTP and Placem ent  \nunits, and site visits  to the Boys Republic  and Optimist group hom es confirms that youth \ncontinue to receive a full range  of services upon their transi tion into the community or a \nplacement facility.  PCMS Case Notes docum ent referrals for individual and family services, as  \nwell as programs designed to increase the youths’ skills and/ or job opportunities.  The services \nthey receive appear to be consistent with thos e identified in their Transitional MDTs and case \nplans, and are modified based on their progress and emerging needs. \n \nDuring this monitoring period, the County had one  operational Juvenile  Day Reporting Center \n(JDRC) in Van Nuys, and was in the process  of opening two additional  JDRCs in East Los \nAngeles and Lynwood.  Members of the monitori ng team  visited all three sites, had an \nopportunity to speak with the Direct ors and staff, review materials used or to be used, and were \nbriefed on the programming that will be offered at each facility.  The Van Nuys JDRC was again  \nbetween cycles at the tim e of the monitori ng visit.  The ELA and Lynwood JDRCs will offer   \ncomprehensive educational services, will include family support services, and will utilize direct \nservices and referrals as needed to approximately 60 youth each.  The Van Nuys JDRC can offer \nsimilar programming, but no school com ponent, to approximately 30 youth.  All sites plan to \nprovide transportation services for the youth. \n117  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nThe ELA and Lynwood JDRCs were set to begi n accepting youth during the twelfth monitoring \nperiod.  The new JDRCs will start at partial cap acity, but should reach full capacity during that \ntime. \n \nAt this tim e, the County is in partial com pliance with the requirem ents of this sub-section of \nParagraph 73. \n \nRecommendations: \n   Fully open and staff the additional DRCs in tim e for the Monitors to be able to asses s  \nthem relative to the requirements of this provision. \n   Sufficiently staff and train JDRC  staff so that they are able  to ensure that youth receive \nand participate in all appropriate services.  \n   Collect and  analyze d ata necessary to  audit and report on com pliance with the \nrequirements of this section.  \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n   Meetings with Gang, CCTP and Placement DPOs, supervisor, managers and staff. \n   Meetings and discussions with Probation Department managers and executives. \n   Review of files, MDT m inutes and PCM not es for a sample of youth released from \nCamps during March and April. \n   Review of the citation diversion program.  \n   Site visits to the Van Nuys, ELA and Lynwood JDRCs. \n   Site visits to the Boys Republic Group Ho me and the Optim ist Group Hom e in Los \nAngeles. \n \n \n73-6:  External Partnership: The County agrees to engage an external research entity to   \nconduct a longitudinal study and develop baseline data tracking systems to assist in evaluating \nsystemic ou tcomes for  youth. This collabor ation is in tended to improve the timelines s, \ncoordination, and effectiveness of Probation serv ices for youth who come  in contact with the \njuvenile justice system, and the ir families.

The purpos e \nof the Study is to asse ss the level of services received  by each youth and thei r performance on \nindicators such as recidivism, education, behavioral health status and employment.  In a meeting \non June 5, 2014, Monitors were inform ed by CSULA that the County is fully cooperating with \nthe terms of the Agreem ent by providing ready access to all d ata, documentation, and staf f \nneeded to move forward with the Study.  CSULA further reported completing the collection and \nanalysis of data on the 500 youth that exited placement (250 youth) and camp (250) in 2011.  By \nJune 30, 2014, CSULA was in preparations to begi n collecting data on current youth exiting \ncamps and placement to compare to the original group.   \n \nDiscussion by Monitors:   \n \nIn March the County finalized its Agree ment with California State University, Los Angeles \n(CSULA) for the Program  Outcome  Study intended to satisfy the re quirement of this section.   \nMonitors met with Dr. Denise Herz of CSULA  and discussed the scope, intent, and progress to \ndate of the study.  It is clear  from that m eeting that the study  will provide all the data and \nanalysis required, plus a good deal more.  Dr. Herz also confirmed that all the data, records, and \nassistance requested of the County by those involved in the study are being provided in a timely \nmanner.  The study  will culm inate in a f ull report, and meeting s to  explain and explore the \nfindings with the County.  Dr. Herz graciously offered to discuss the study with all parties to the \nagreement as requested.  \n \nAt this time, the County is in Substantial Compliance with the requirements of this sub-section of \nParagraph 73. \n \nRecommendations: \n\t   Continue to provide the data  and access required to allow  CSULA to comply with the  \nterms of the Delegated Authority Agreement for the Program Outcome Study. \n \nEvidentiary Basis: \n\t   Review of the executed Delegated Authority Agreement. \n\t   Meetings with Dr. Herz and Probation executive and management staff. \n \n \n   \n119  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n73-7:  Quality Assurance: The County shall develop a nd implement a quality assurance   \nmonitoring tool to assess compliance with ite ms 1-5 of paragraph 73, and shall take steps as \nappropriate to overcome or reduce any identified obstacles or gaps that prevent it from serving \nall otherwise qualified youth in their home communities.  \n \nCounty’s Self-Assessment: \n \nAudit Performance Expectations  \nDuring the latter half of the 11th Monitoring Period, Paragraph 73 audit tools were developed in \ncollaboration with the responsible Probation Ma nagers that oversee operations for Intake and \nDetention Control (IDC), Camps Assessment Unit (CAU), Out of Home Screening Unit (OHS),  \nCamps, Camp Community Trans ition Program  (CCTP), Placem ent Servic es Bureau, an d \nIntensive Gang Suppression Program (IGSP).  While  some tools have been fully implem ented \nand data captured for the first half of the Mon itoring Period, other tools  remain to be f inalized \nduring the 12th Monitoring Period, and the Paragraph 73 audit process will be fully implemented.  \nEvery Paragraph 73 tool was subject to review a nd revision during this audit period to adjust to  \nall programmatic changes.  During  the next M onitoring Period th e tools will co ntinue to be \nrevised and reviewed for appropriate collection of data as additional Tracking Logs, Forms, and  \nDatabases are created and/or m odified throughout the various offices and cam ps to meet full \ncompliance with Paragraph 73.  Perform ance expectations were establis hed and added to the \naudit tools according to each operations/camps function within the Paragraph 73 continuum of \ncare.  Due to the unique nature of the Paragraph 73 audits in which it is possible to have \nperformance expectations for two different ope rations/camps on one tool (P73.3), there will be \nprocesses to ensure that each operation receives  the pertinent data to im prove their serv ices.   \nAdditionally, each tool will be reviewed for the appropriate audit scheduling to capture the most \nrelevant data (m onthly, every 45 days, quarterly,  etc.).  If  an operatio n does not m eet audit \nexpectations, auditors will no tify and meet with the opera tion Manager to develop  corrective  \nmeasures to achieve those expectations during  the next audit period.  The corrective m easures \nwill then be  documented on the audit too l to b e reviewed by the auditors f or progress in th e  \nfollowing audit months.   \n  \nContinuous Monitoring System  \nSince the last Self-Assessment Report, a new Continuous Monitoring System (CMS) has been in \ndevelopment by the DOJ/Quality Assurance Serv ices Bureau as noted in Provision 47. The \nsystem is designed to monitor ongoing data su ch as youth-on-youth  violence, dr ug-related \nincidents, audit compliance rates, or any other da ta that the Department chooses to monitor and \nimprove. Control charts in the sy stem are used to plot incom ing data and to identify anom alous \ntrends that require inquiry or corrective m easures. The goal is to provi de continuous process \nimprovement by establishing perfor mance expectations, monitoring data, developing corrective \naction plans, increasing collaboration between  units, conducting recomm endation reviews, and \nestablishing accountability. The system  is pla nned to be fully im plemented during the next \nauditing period. \n \nOnce audit results and program measures have been collected, the data will be ente red into the  \nmonitoring system. As data a re entered, control charts in the system will automatically update \nand display  any anomalous occurrence or tr end. Each operation and facility will have a \n120  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nmonitoring system file with audit a nd program data that will be monitored and maintained by  \nDOJ/Quality Assurance Services Bureau. If an anomalous program trend or consistent difficulty  \nin meeting audit exp ectations is id entified, a  collaborative meeting will be he ld between the \nmonitoring reviewers and the facility director to discuss possible causes for the trend or anomaly.  \n \nIf necessary, a proces s-related review will be conducted to  tho roughly examine prog ram \nprocesses for barriers and possible areas f or improvement.  This review will con sist of data  \ncollection and data analysis with a report consisting of findings and process recommendations. A \nwidely kno wn and use d quality c ontrol too l w ill be  use d to a ssist with acc urate prob lem  \nidentification. The Fishbone diagram, also known as  the cause and effect diagram , will be used \nto review potential variables that may be producing unfavorable program results. These variables \ninclude Manpower (staff), Milieu (environm ent), Method (process), Materials (documents, etc.) \nand Machine (technology).  After careful review of these variables and collected data, a findings \nreport with process recommendations and corrective action plan will be submitted to the facility \ndirector. The spec ifics of the cor rective action plan will be at the  discretion of the f acility  \ndirector regarding implementation timeframes and people responsible for implementation.  \n \nTo ensure accountability and im plementation of recommendations, a recomm endation review  \nwill be conducted at a specified time after the corrective action plan has been agreed upon. The \nrecommendation review m ay consist of a site  visit, process observation, file review, or \ninterviews to dete rmine if  recommendation s were im plemented and the cu rrent progr ess. \nFeedback will be provided to facility director and documented. \n \nA Quality Assurance File System  will be cre ated and mainta ined for future references. The \ncomprehensive file system will co nsist of audit results, CMS control charts, p rocess-related  \nreviews, corrective action plans, and recommendation reviews. The data from the file system will \nbe used for biannual self-assessm ents or quality  assurance analysis to id entify process barriers, \ntype of intervention taken, and process progress.  \n \nEnhancing Efficiency  \nThe results from  the Continuous Monitoring System  may also be used to enhance efficiency. \nCamps meeting all exp ectations  in all audit areas for a tim e period of three m onths may not \nrequire monthly auditing, rather a quarterly audit review. Graduating a camp to a quarterly audit \nafter demonstrating exemplary audit results for a three m onth period would allow staff to assist \ncamps in need, as identified by CMS. Staff would be able to conduct process-related reviews and \nproblem identification at camps that have had di fficulty meeting audit expectations. This would \nensure the eventual graduation of all cam ps in meeting expectations and transitioning to a \nquarterly audit. The quarterly au dit would consist of  a random review of  audit data from  the  \nauditing quarter. If a camp should not meet quarterly expectations, assistance would be provided \nwhere needed, or, the camp may return to monthly auditing if required.  The CMS would ensure \nthat the camps graduated to quart erly audits are still m onitored during the pe riod to prev ent \nissues from developing and remaining unchecked until the next audit.  \n121  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion by Monitors: \n \n(Insert by Monitor) \n \nRecommendations: \n \n(Insert by Monitor) \n \n   \n122 \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nDiscussion by Monitors: \n \nThe monitoring tool for 73-1 covers the key issu es necessary to monitor the implementation of \nthe LADS and the detention decisions that flow from the screening process. As noted previously, \nthe January-March 2014 data  is the first test of  the usefulness of the tool and therefore sm all  \nmodifications are an expected part of the pr ocess. This tool would benefit from  a more   \ncomprehensive accounting of the w ay in which youth ended up in detention.  It currently tracks \nthe proportion of youth who are sc reened and then released,  placed on SODA/PAD/CDP, or \ndetained. From there, it tracks the proportion of youth who scored into detention (i.e., 10+ points \non the LADS) versus those who we re detained based on  one of the various types of overrides. \nThe override list is  not exhaustive (e.g., it om its the Policy  Overrides) and th erefore the total \nnumber of youth in the score/override subcategories do not equal the total number of youth who \nwere detained. This is an easy f ix that will p rovide an e nhanced ability to m onitor override \nproblem that is currently underm ining the implementation of the LADS (see discussion in 73-1 \nfor more detail).  \n \nThe monitoring tool for 73-3 covers most of the indicators that are necessary to assess the quality \nof aftercare services delivered while the youth is  still in Camp. The tool could be further refined \nin the following ways: \n \t  Fix the formula associated w ith calculating the proportion of Initial MDTs attended by \nthe ACPO. Currently, the formula uses the number of meetings in which the ACPO was \nnotified (Q2) as the denominator, instead of  the total number of meetings (Q1). Using the \ntotal number of meetings will give a truer assessment of the proportion of cases in which  \nthe ACPO was present.  The  question of whether the ACPO was notified would be an \nimportant area to examine if the overall performance indicator were not being met at the \n80% level. \n\t   In the se ction that ex amines participation in the Initial MDT m eeting by the various   \nagencies, count only the num ber of meetings in which a representative attended, not the  \ntotal number of representatives, as is curr ently the practice. Using the total num ber of \nrepresentatives risks o verestimating the pr oportion of m eetings that actually had \nrepresentation, if multipl e representatives went to som e  meetings while others did not \nhave a representative at all.  \n   In the sam pled cases section, add a question  about whether the first casework session \nbetween the youth and caseworker was timely.  \n   In the sampled cases section, add a question about whether the ACPO met with the youth \nwithin 30 days of his admission to Camp  (as is required by Department policy).  \n\t   In the sampled cases section, revise Q22 to assess whether the  parent was present at the \ntransition MDT (in person or by phone),  rather than the  parent and youth (the youth is \nalmost always there, but statistics on parent participation will show more variation).  \n \nThe monitoring tools for 73-4 are  less fully developed and requi re further refinement.  The \nMonitors will meet with the Quality Assurance Director and staff to finalize those tools.  \n \nThe County’s track record with the audit tools for other provisions demonstrates its commitment \nto refining the audit to ols to the p oint that they are m ost useful for the purpose  of quality \nimprovement. As shown in the self-assessm ents for Provision 17 and 43, in particular, once the \n123  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps     11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nrefinement process is underway, the County uses  the audits to identif y the Cam ps in which \nperformance is not at the expect ed levels, and then enacts a pr oblem-solving process to identify \nthe underlying causes of the problem. From  there, corrective action plans are developed and \noverseen until the expected level of performance has been achieved. Th e Monitor is confident \nthat the process will be no different for Provision 73.  \n \nAt this time, the County remains in partial compliance with the requirements of this sub-section \nof Paragraph 73. \n \nRecommendations:  \n1.   Consider the revisions suggested for audit tools 73-1 and 73-3, as described above. \n2.   Meet with Monitors to refine and finalize the audit tools for 73-4. \n   \n124  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \nSecond Amendment to the Memorandum of Agreement Between the  \nUnited States and the County of Los Angeles Regarding the Los  \nAngeles Probation Camps   \nI. \t INTRODUCTION  \nA. \t  On October 31, 2008, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) to \nresolve the Departm ent of Justice’s investigation of alleged unlawful conditions at the \nLos Angeles County Probation Camps (“Prob ation Camps” or “Camps”), commenced \npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institut ionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. ' 1997 \n(“CRIPA”), and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. \n' 14141 (“Section 14141”). The MOA was the result of a cooperative effort by the \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Count y of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County \nProbation Departm ent, and the L os Angeles  County Departm ent of Mental Health \n(collectively, “the County”)  to guarantee and protect the  federally protected rights of \nyouth committed to the Probation Camps. \nB. \t  MOA paragraph 48 requires that the County achieve and maintain substantial compliance \nwith the ter ms of the MOA f or a period of  one year. T he MOA fu rther provides, at \nparagraph 62, that the MOA shall terminate four years from its effective date, or October \n31, 2012. Accordingly, to fully satisfy the  MOA, the County was required to reach \nsubstantial compliance with the MOA by October 31, 2011, and maintain this compliance \nuntil October 31, 2012. The parties jointly select ed a Monitoring Team  to evaluate and \nreport on the County’s compliance. Under MOA paragraph 62, DOJ reserved the right to \ninitiate a civil action pursuant to CRIPA and/or Section 141 41 to enforce the MOA and  \nprotect the federal rights of youth if the County failed to fully satisfy the MOA within the \nfour-year period. \nC. \t  The County has implemented significant reforms in furtherance of the MOA, as reflected \nin the Monitoring Team ’s biannual reports.  Based on these reports, the County has \nachieved substantial compliance with all but f our paragraphs in sections III through VI, \nwhich set o ut the substantive term s of the  MOA (the substantive paragraphs). Despite \nthese a ccomplishments, the Coun ty is un able to m aintain one ye ar of  substantia l \ncompliance to fully satisfy the terms of the MOA by the bright-line term ination date of \nOctober 31, 2012. \nD. \t  In light of the County’s significant  strides toward com pliance and its ongoing \ncommitment to reform, the parties agree to modify the MOA, pursuant to paragraph 72, \nas set forth below. The modification is intended to focus attention on resolving the MOA \nparagraphs not yet in com pliance by el iminating the O ctober 31, 2012 bright-line \ntermination date and building on ref orms already in place, as verified b y the Monitoring  \nTeam’s most recent compliance evaluations. Section III of this Am endment clarifies the \nfour remaining substantive paragraphs to achieve desired outcomes and facilitate ongoing \ncompliance assessments. Section IV of  this  Amendment adds paragraph 73 to increase \nyouth’s access to community-based  services to prom ote rehabilitation, consistent with \n137  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A. County MOA on L.A.  Probation Camps  \t   11th Monitoring Report  \n \n \npublic safety and the best interests of youth. \nII.  \t AMENDMENTS TO SECTION VII OF THE MOA REGARDING MONITORING \nAND ENFORCEMENT  \nPursuant to MOA paragraph 72, the parties  hereby agree to m odify the m onitoring and \nenforcement paragraphs as follows: \n\t  Termination and Enfor cement: The parties agree to elim inate the four-year term ination \n1. \nrequirement of MOA paragraph 62.

Accordingly, these paragraphs are fully satisfied and \nshall terminate as of th e effective date  of this Am endment. Paragraph 59 has been \ndeemed to be substantially com pliant  in prior Monitoring Reports. T he County, \nconsistent with the requirements of paragraph 59, shall continue to provide any newly \ncreated or revised policies to the DOJ, for review and approval for the duration of this \nagreement for any substantive paragraphs  that have not yet com pleted the twelve- \nmonth substantial compliance monitoring period.  \n2 \t   The County m ust achieve substantial co mpliance with all rem aining substantive \nparagraphs in sections III th rough VI of the MOA by Decem ber 31, 2013. The \nCounty will make all reasonable efforts to comply prior to this date.  \n3\t    The MOA, as a mended, will term inate whe n the County: (1) im plements all \nparagraphs in MOA sections III-VI pursu ant to paragraph 48, and (2) im plements  \nparagraph 73 as set forth in Section IV.A.9. The requirem ents of paragraph 48 shall \nnot apply to paragraph 73. Should the Count y fail to implement this Amendment or \notherwise fail to sa tisfy its te rms, DOJ rese rves the righ t to initiate a civil actio n \npursuant to CRIPA and/or Section 14141, or  take  other appropriate enforcem ent \naction, to protect the constitutional and federal statutory rights of youth committed or \nsupervised by the County. \n\t  Implementation of Rem aining Paragraphs : In accord ance with th e Monitoring Team ’s \n2. \ncompliance assessments, and to ensure the full implementation and sustainability of reforms, \nthe parties agree to the  following implementation schedule for the re maining substantive  \nparagraphs in sections III through VI of the MOA: \n1.   \t Paragraphs that Must Maintain Substantial Com pliance: According to the   \nMonitoring Team , the County has achieve d substantial com pliance with the \nfollowing substantive paragraphs of  the MOA: 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, \n28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, and 45. The parties agree that  \nthe County has achieved substantial compliance with these paragraphs, but has yet \nto maintain one year of substantial compliance.  \n138 \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.

The Monitoring Team  shal l continue to \nevaluate and report on the status of  these p aragraphs through December \n31, 2012. Thereafter, based on the Monito ring Team’s assessment, if the  \nCounty has maintained substantial compliance by December 31, 2012, the  \nparagraphs will no longer be subject to status reporting by the Monitoring \nTeam, pursuant to MOA paragraph 54. Th e County agrees to continue to \nimplement the policies, procedures , and practices related to these   \nparagraphs for the life of the MOA to ensure th at the constitutional and  \nfederal statutory rights of youth in the County’s custody or supervision are  \nupheld. \nc. \t  If any paragraph falls out of substantial compliance prior to termination of  \nthat paragraph, the County shall bri ng such paragraph into substantial \ncompliance no later than Dece mber 31, 2013, and shall maintain such \nsubstantial compliance for a period of one year. The County shall make all \nreasonable efforts to bring all paragr aphs into substantia l compliance at \nthe earliest possible date.   \n2.   \t Paragraphs that Must Achieve Substantial C ompliance:  According to th e  \nMonitoring Team, the County has not achie ved substantial compliance with the \nfollowing substantive paragraphs of  the MOA: 15, 17, 43, and 47. The County \nagrees to achieve substantial compliance with these paragraphs by December 31, \n2013. Once substantial compliance is achieved, the County agrees to maintain one \nyear of substantial compliance. The paragr aphs will continue to be subject to \nstatus reporting by the Monitoring Team until each paragraph maintains one year  \nof substantial compliance and is terminated. Any paragraph that does not achieve \nsubstantial compliance by Dece mber 31,  2013, shall be subject to enf orcement \nunder Section II.A.3 of this Am endment. To ensure the sustainability of reforms, \nthe parties agree to re tain paragraph 47 until su ch time as all o ther substantive  \nparagraphs of the Agreement, except for paragraph 73, are in full compliance. \nC. \t All other monitoring and enforcement paragraphs in section VII of the MOA shall remain \nunchanged and in full force and effect for the life of this MOA, subject to further joint \nmodification by the parties, pursuant to MOA paragraph 72. \n \n \n139  \n \n\nDOJ/L.A.
