    "summary": "<p>On April 9th, 2008, the United States filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The plaintiff sued the Marion Superior Court, which was responsible for operating the Marion Superior Court Juvenile Detention Center (MSCJDC), under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, 42 U.S.C. §14141, the Rehabilitation Act, Section 504 of 29 U.S.C. §701, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §1400, for depriving youths detained in MSCJDC of their federal statutory and constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiff alleged that MSCJDC failed to ensure that youths were adequately protected from other youths, self-harm, unreasonable isolation practices, and unsafe and unsanitary conditions, and that youths with disabilities did not have access to required special education programs. The plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief.</p><p>The lawsuit was borne out of an investigation of the MSCJDC by the Department of Justice (DOJ) pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997. In a findings letter, the DOJ reported that MSCJDC was deficient in safeguarding the rights of its youths in several ways. First, MSCJDC was inadequately protecting its youths from violence due to inadequate staffing and training on how to de-escalate violence, inadequate youth programming leading to increased boredom and violent tendencies, an inadequate behavior management program to reward positive behavior, and inadequate housing classification to separate youths based on levels of hostility or predatory behavior. Second, MSCJDC was excessively using isolation tactics as a form of punishment and behavior management. MSCJDC staff did not distinguish in their use of isolation to address serious, violent infractions or harmless disruptive behavior, did not provide youths in isolation with essential services such as medical care, education, or programming, and failed to exercise oversight of isolation, such as requiring supervisor review or giving notice to the youth. Third, MSCJDC was inadequately protecting its youths from suicide risks through inadequate mental health care, inadequate screening for suicidal tendencies, and inadequate staff training. Fourth, MSCJDC had inadequate systems of reporting and accountability, such as for reporting grievances, investigating child abuse allegations or staff misconduct, and maintaining accurate records of reports and investigations. Fifth, MSCJDC’s facilities were insufficiently safe for the youths, subjecting them to increased risks of fire hazards, lack of sanitation, chemical exposure, and injury. Finally, MSCJDC did not provide adequate special education support, both in screening for special education needs and providing programming and staffing.</p><p>The same day that the plaintiff filed the lawsuit, the plaintiff and defendants filed a joint motion for conditional dismissal. The parties agreed to a settlement agreement, laying out provisions for how to implement needed improvements in MSCJDC’s operation on each of the issues detailed in the findings letter. Specifically, to address protection of youths from violence, MSCJDC agreed to: <br>(1) ensure reasonably safe premises;</br><br>(2) increase staffing;</br><br>(3) develop and implement a training curriculum for staff on behavior management, de-escalation, use of force, communication, crisis intervention, child abuse reporting, and suicide prevention before working with youth;</br><br>(4) implement an annual staff training on use of force, suicide prevention, and child abuse reporting;</br><br>(5) minimize youth idle time by providing sufficient structured programming;</br><br>(6) create a behavior management program to reward positive social behavior; and</br><br> (7) create a housing classification system. </p><p>For excessive use of isolation tactics, MSCDJC agreed to, first, develop oversight procedures regarding the use of isolation, such as ensuring supervision and notice to youths, and second, ensure that youths in isolation have access to essential medical services and programming. </p><p>For suicide prevention, MSCJDC agreed to (1) conduct timely and accurate suicide risk assessments, (2) implement a gradual step-down suicide watch program, (3) provide mental health services and emergency equipment to prevent suicides, and (4) document all suicide precautions and attempts.  For systems of reporting and accountability, MSCJDC agreed to create and implement systems for child abuse reporting, internal investigations of staff misconduct allegations, and youths filing grievances. For the conditions of the facilities, MSCJDC agreed to implement a fire safety program and to develop and implement chemical, general safety, and sanitation measures. Finally, for special education, MSCJDC agreed to screen and identify youths with special education needs, provide individualized education programs, and ensure access to educational services. Judge Larry J. McKinney granted this motion on April 11th, 2008. On May 28th, 2008, the parties appointed an Agreement Coordinator to enforce the settlement agreement.</p><p>On April 9th, 2011, the settlement agreement expired after the agreed upon three-year period. On April 19th, 2011, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the lawsuit, stating that the defendants had achieved substantial compliance with 25 out of 30 of the substantive provisions of the settlement agreement, and that the parties planned to continue working to resolve the remaining provisions in the next months. Because the parties agreed that judicial oversight was no longer required, the judge dismissed the lawsuit on May 2nd, 2011.  This case is now closed.</p>",

The parties agreed to a three-year joint settlement agreement to improve MSCJDC's operation. After the three-year period, the parties agreed that the defendant had substantially complied with the provisions of the settlement agreement, so Judge Larry J. Mckinney dismissed the lawsuit on May 2nd, 2011. The case has now ended.",

With the exception of DOJ’s\nfindings letter referenced in Section I.E of the\nIntroduction hereof, and any DOJ technical assistance\nrecommendations, no prior or contemporaneous\ncommunications, oral or written, will be relevant or\nadmissible for purposes of determining the meaning of\nany provisions herein in this litigation or in any\nother proceeding. \nD. \t This Agreement is enforceable only by the parties and\nis binding upon the parties, by and through their\nofficials, agents, employees, and successors. \nE. \t Upon execution of this Agreement, the DOJ shall file a\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Indiana, and file\ncontemporaneously a Joint Motion for Conditional\nDismissal of the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 41(a)(2).  A copy of this Agreement\nshall be attached to the Joint Motion for Conditional \nDismissal and that motion shall:  (1) request that the\ncourt dismiss the complaint upon the passage of three\n(3) years from the date of its filing or the Court’s\nearlier substantial compliance with the terms of this\nAgreement; (2) request that the court place the case on\nits inactive docket; and (3) retain jurisdiction over\nthe case until three (3) years have passed or an\nearlier final dismissal is entered.  The parties\nexpressly declare that this provision shall not be\ninterpreted to provide for active judicial supervision. \nF. \t If the DOJ believes that the Court has failed to \nfulfill a significant obligation under this Agreement,\nthe DOJ will, prior to instituting judicial action to\nenforce this Agreement, give written notice of the\nfailure to the Court.  The Court shall have sixty days\nfrom the date of such notice to cure the failure, or\nsuch additional time as is reasonable due to the nature \nof the issue and agreed upon by the parties, and\nprovide the DOJ with sufficient proof of its cure.  At \nthe end of the sixty day period, or such additional\ntime as is described above, in the event that the DOJ\ndetermines that the failure has not been cured, the DOJ\nmay institute judicial action without further notice. \n11 \n\n\nHowever, in case of an emergency posing an immediate\nthreat to the health or safety of youths, the United\nStates will notify the Court, and the cure period\ndescribed herein will be truncated to forty-eight (48)\nhours, before instituting judicial action.  The DOJ \ncommits to work in good faith with the Court to avoid\nenforcement actions. \nG. \t This Agreement resolves the United States’ current\ninvestigation of the MSCJDC pursuant to CRIPA and\nSection 14141.  The United States shall not seek \nadditional measures or requirements in enforcing this\nAgreement. \nH. \t Failure by any party to enforce this entire Agreement\nor any provision thereof with respect to any deadline\nor any provision herein shall not be construed as a\nwaiver of its right to enforce other deadlines and\nprovisions in this Agreement. \nI. \t To the extent that the Court’s implementation of any\nprovision of this Agreement requires the exercise of\nprofessional judgment, the standard articulated in\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), shall be\napplied. \nJ. \t The Court shall appoint an Agreement Coordinator to\ncoordinate and oversee compliance with this Agreement. \nK. \t This Agreement shall terminate definitively and\nunconditionally no later than three years from the\neffective date. \n1. \t The Agreement may end on a section-by-section\nbasis earlier than three years from the effective\ndate if the Court has substantially complied with\nthe provisions of that section of the Agreement\nfor at least twelve months. \n2. \t The burden shall be on the Court to demonstrate \nthat it has complied substantially with the\nAgreement.  A finding of substantial compliance\nmay not be unreasonably withheld. \n3. \t Noncompliance with mere technicalities, or\ntemporary failure to comply during a period of\notherwise sustained compliance will not constitute\nfailure to maintain substantial compliance.  At \nthe same time, temporary compliance during a\nperiod of sustained noncompliance shall not\nconstitute substantial compliance. \n12 \n\n\n4. \t The parties agree that the standards against which\nsubstantial compliance will be monitored are those\nthat are constitutionally required and required by\nFederal statute.  The Court’s unilateral \nimplementation of best practices will not modify\nthe standard. \nL. \t The parties agree to defend the provisions of this\nAgreement.  The parties shall notify each other of any\ncourt challenge to this Agreement.  In the event any\nprovision of this Agreement is challenged in any local\nor state court, removal to a federal court may be\nsought. \nM. \t If any unforeseen circumstance occurs which causes a\nfailure to timely carry out any requirements of this\nAgreement, the Court shall notify the DOJ in writing\nwithin a reasonable time after the Court becomes aware \nof the unforeseen circumstance and its impact on the\nCourt’s ability to perform under this Agreement.  The \nnotice shall describe the cause of the failure to \nperform and the measures taken to prevent or minimize\nthe failure.  The Court shall implement all reasonable\nmeasures to avoid or minimize any such failure. \nN. \t No person reporting conditions which may constitute a\nviolation of laws or the Constitution of the United \nStates or this Agreement shall be subjected to\nretaliation in any manner for so reporting.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 1997d. \nO. \t All subheadings in this Agreement are written for the\nconvenience of locating individual provisions.  If \nquestions arise as to the meanings of individual\nprovisions, the parties shall follow the text of each\nprovision. \nP. \t In the event any provision of this Agreement is\ndeclared invalid for any reason by a court of competent\njurisdiction, said finding shall not affect the\nremaining provisions of this Agreement. \n13 \n\n\nFOR THE UNITED STATES:\n\n /s/ Grace Chung Becker\nGRACE CHUNG BECKER \nActing Assistant\nAttorney General\nCivil Rights Division\n /s/ Shanetta Y.

Washington  Street \nIndianapolis,  Indiana  46204 \nRe:  Marion  County  Juvenile  Detention Center, \nIndianapolis,  Indiana \nDear  Executive  Committee  Members  and  County  Council  President: \nI  write  to  report  the  findings  of  the  Civil  Rights \nDivision's  investigation of  conditions  at  the  Marion  County \nJuvenile  Detention Center  (\"Marion\").  On  July 18,  2006,  we \nnotified County  officials  of  our  intent  to  conduct  an \ninvestigation of  Marion  pursuant  to  the  Civil  Rights  of \nInstitutionalized Persons  Act  (\"CRIPA\"),  42  U.S.C.  §  1997,  and \nthe  Violent  Crime  Control  and  Law  Enforcement  Act  of  1994, \n42  U.S.C.  §  14141  (\"Section  14141\"). \nAs  we  noted,  both  CRIPA  and  Section  14141  give  the \nDepartment  of  Justice  authority  to  seek  a  remedy  for  a  pattern or \npractice  of  conduct  that  violates  the  constitutional  or  federal \nstatutory rights  of  youth  in  juvenile  justice  institutions. \n\n..:.·  2  -\nOn  December  13-15,  2006  and  February  20-22,  2007,  we \nconducted on-site  inspections  at  Marion  with  expert  consultants \nin  juvenile  justice,  special  education,  custodial  sexual \nmisconduct,  and  environmental  health and  sanitation.  We \ninterviewed direct-care  and  administrative  staff,  youth,  and \nschool  personnel.  Before,  during,  and  after our visits,  we \nreviewed  an  extensive  number.of  documents,  including policies  and \nprocedures,  incident  reports,  investigative  reports,  grievances \nfrom  youth,  staff  personnel  files,  unit  logs,  orientation \nmaterials,  staff  training materials,  and  school  records.  In \nkeeping  with  our pledge  of  transparency  and  to  provide  technical \nassistance where  appropriate,  we  conveyed  our preliminary \nfindings  to Marion  and  Marion  County  officials  at  the  close  of \nour  on-site visits. \nWe  commend  the  staff  at  Marion  for  their helpful  and \nprofessional  conduct  throughout  the  course  of  the  investigation. \nWe  received  full  cooperation with  our  investigation and \nappreciate  the  County  and  Court's  receptiveness  to  our \nconsultants'  on-site  recommendations. 1  We  would  also  like  to \nrecognize  the  recent  addition of  Mr.  Richard  Curry  as  the \nSuperintendent  of  the  Marion  County  Juvenile  Detention Center. \nDuring  his  brief  tenure,  Mr.  Curry had  already begun  to  identify \nareas  of  improvement  and  had  identified target  dates  to  address \nvarious  concerns.  We  anticipate  that Mr.  Curry will  continue \nthese  efforts  to  improve  conditions  at Marion. \nIn  addition,  we  note  that  Marion  is  planning  to  implement  a \nRadio  Frequency  Identification Device  (RFID),  an  innovative \nprogram  to monitor  staff movement.  The  facility  is also planning \nto  install  internal  video  cameras  to  supplement  the  existing \nexternal  cameras.  These  changes  have  the  potential  to be \npositive  steps  toward  meaningful  change  at  Marion.  Based  on \nreports  we  received during  our  investigation,  these·programs \nshould  be  underway  in  the  near  future. \nConsistent  with  the  statutory requirements  of  CRIPA,  we  now \nwrite  to  advise  you  of  the  findings  of  our  investigation,  the \nfacts  supporting  them,  and  the  minimum  remedial  steps  that  are \nnecessary  to  address  the  deficiencies  we  have  identified. \n42  §  U.S.C.  1997b.  As  described more  fully  below,  we  conclude \nthat  certain conditions  at  Marion violate  the  constitutional \n1  The  facility  is  owned  and  funded  by Marion  County, \nIndiana,  and  operated by  the Marion  County  Superior  Court  under \nthe  direction of  its Executive  Committee  and  Chief  Probation \nOfficer. \n\n- 3  -\nrights  of  the  youth.  In particular,  we  find  that  youth  confined \nat Marion  are  not  adequately protected  from  harm.  We  also  find \nthat  deficiencies  in  the  areas  of  fire  safety,  general \nsanitation,  and  general  safety pose  a  significant  risk of  disease \nand  injury to youth  and  staff.  In  addition,  the  facility  fails \nto provide  required  education  services  pursuant  to  the \nIndividuals  with Disabilities Education Act  (\"IDEAn),  20  U.S.C.A. \n§§  1400-1482  (West,  Westlaw  through  July  3,  2006). \nIn  the  course  of  our  investigation,  we  also  reviewed \nallegations  of  custodial  sexual  misconduct.  We  find  no  current \nsystemic  constitutional  deficiencies  in  this  area,  and  commend \nthe  County  for  its commitment  to  safeguarding  youth  at  the \nfacility from  staff  sexual  misconduct  in  the  wake  of  the  multiple \nsexual  misconduct  charges  filed  against  staff members  in 2006. \nCounty  and  Court  officials  responded vigorously  after  learning  of \nthose  criminal  charges,  and  exhibited  strong  leadership  in \nworking  to  alleviate  the  threat  of  continued  sexual  misconduct. \nWe  applaud  the  efforts  that  County  and  Court  officials have \nalready taken  irt  this  regard. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nMarion  is  a  secure  juvenile  justice  facility  built  in  1989 \nand  located  in  Indianapolis,  Indiana.  Marion  is  primarily a \ndetention center,  receiving  youth  between  the  ages  of  seven  and \n17  who  are  awaiting  adjudication,  or who  have  been  adjudicated \ndelinquent  and  are  awaiting  placement  at  a  State  facility.  The \nfacility has  a  capacity to  hold  144  youth,  including  a  population \nof  approximately  30  females.  The  youth population  at  Marion \nfluctuates  daily.  On  December  14,  2006,  116  youth were  confined \nat  the  facility.  During  our  tour  on  February  20,  2007,  the \nfacility confined  124  youth. \nOur  investigation of  systemic  conditions  at  Marion  began \nfollowing  the  criminal  indictment  of  ten  former ·employees  of  the \nfacility,  including Marion's  former  superintendent.·  Those \nemployees  had  been  charged  with  a  total  of  52  criminal  counts, \nincluding  child molestation,  sexual  misconduct  with  a  minor, \nchild  solicitation,  and  official misconduct  including  concealing \nevidence  and  failing  to  report  sexual  child abuse. 2  We \nsubsequently  received  information  regarding  an  independent \ninvestigative  report  authored  by  the  National  Partnership  for \n2  As  of  this  writing,  charges  have  been  dismissed  against \nsix employees,  one  employee  was  convicted,  one  employee  was \nacquitted,  and  the  two  remaining  employees  are  awaiting  trial. \n\n- 4  -\nJuvenile  Services3  regarding  conditions  at  the  facility.  That \nreport,  based  on  a  February  14-16,  2006  facility  assessment, \nconcluded,  among  other  things,  that  \"residents  at  the  facility \nare  not  safe.\" \nII.  LEGAL  STANDARDS \nBoth  CRIPA  and .Section  14141  authorize  the  Department  of \nJustice  to  seek  a  remedy  for  a  pattern or practice  of  conduct \nthat  violates  the  constitutional  or  federal  statutory rights  of \nyouth  in  juvenile  justice institutions.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1997, \n14141.  States  and  their political  subdivisions  must  provide \npersons  confined  in  a  non-penal  context  - like  the  youth  confined \nin Marion  who  are  either awaiting  adjudication or have  been \nadjudicated delinquent  and  not  convicted  of  a  crime  - with \nreasonably  safe  conditions  of  confinement.

Gillis v.  Litscher,  468  F.3d  488,  493  (7th  Cir. \n2006) . \nThe  State  and  County  are  also  obliged  to provide  special \neducation  services  to youth  with  certain disabilities  pursuant  to \nthe  IDEA.  20  U.S.C.A.  §§  1400-1482  (West,  Westlaw  through  July \n3,  2006).  As  described below,  the  County  has  fallen  short  of \nthese  constitutional  and  federal  statutory obligations. \nIII.  FINDINGS \nWe  find  that  Marion  fails  to  adequately protect  youth  in  its \ncare  from  harm  and  serious  threat  of  harm,  fails  to provide \nadequate  fire  safety and  environmental  health  conditions,  and \nfails  to provide  youth with  required  special  education  services. \nA.  INADEQUATE  PROTECTION  FROM  HARM \nYouth  at  Marion  are  not  adequately protected  from  harm \nbecause  youth  are  subjected  to  excessive  levels  of  youth \nviolence,  excessive  and  improper  seclusion practices,  inadequate \nsuicide  prevention measures,  a  dysfunctional  youth  grievance \nprocess,  and  an  unreliable  child  abuse  reporting  and \ninvestigations  system. \ndesigned  and  calculated to  effect  rehabilitation,  moral \nrestoration and  proper  development.\" \n\n- 6  -\n1.  Youth Violence \nYouth  in  institutions  have  a  constitutional  right  to  be \nreasonaply  safe  from  harm  inflicted by  other youth.  Facilities \nmust  maintain  sufficient  structures,  safeguards,  and  staffing to \nensure  reasonable  safety.  Our  investigation revealed  an \nunacceptably high  rate  of  youth violence,  and  a  serious  danger  of \ncontinuing  and  intensifying physical  harm  at  the  facility. \nNearly all  of  the  youth  interviewed by  our  consultants \nreported  that  they  do  not  feel  safe  at  Marion.  We  found \nunacceptably high  levels  of  youth-on-youth  assaults,  and  grossly \ninadequate  safeguards  to  prevent  and  mitigate  such violence. \nIndeed,  DOJ  staff  and  consultants  witnessed,  first  hand,, three \nyouth  assaults  during  our  investigatory tours.  Disturbingly, \nyouth  are  routinely  involved  in  incidents  requiring  emergency \nroom  treatment.  Violent  incidents  at  the  facility requiring \n\"code  blue\"  or  emergency  response  team  intervention occur  daily. \nFor  example: \n•  On  February  11,  2007,  two  youth  [SX] 5  and  [JN]  were  involved \nin a  fight  in the  gym,  resulting  in  lacerations  requiring \ntreatment  in a  local  emergency  room.  The  incident  report. \nsuggests  that  a  lack of  staff  support  may  have  exacerbated \nthe  severity of  the  injuries. \n•  On  January  3,  2007,  two  youth  were  involved  in a  fight. \nOne  of  the  youth,  [BN] ,  required medical  attention  for  a \nbloody nose.  After  repeated  attempts  to  summon  medical \nstaff  to  the  unit,  a  staff person went  to  the  clinic  to  find \nthe  nurse.  Both  nurses  had  their  coats  on  and  were \npreparing  to  depart,  without  any  intention  to  deliver the \nrequested medical  care.  Ultimately,  the  nurses  assessed  the \nyouths'  injuries,  and  ordered  treatment  for  [BN]  at  the \nlocal  emergency  room. \nA  variety of  factors  contribute  to  the  violent  conditions  at \nMarion,  including  inadequate  staffing  levels,  inadequate  staff \ntraining,  inadequate  youth  programming,  an  inadequate  behavior \nm,anagement  program,  and  an  inadequate  housing  classification \nsystem. \n5  To  protect  the  youths,'  identities,  we  use  fictitious \ninitials  throughout  this  letter.  We  will  separately  transmit  to \ncounsel  for  Marion  County  a  schedule.cross-referencing  the \nfictitious  initials with youths'  names. \n\n- 7  -\na.  Inadequate  Staffing Levels \nA  significant  factor  contributing  to  the  high  levels  of \nyouth-on-youth  violence  at  Marion  is  the  absence  of  sufficient \nnumbers  of  staff  to  adequately  supervise  youth.  Without  adequate \nlevels  of  trained  staff  on  duty,  it is not  possible  to  respond  in \na  safe  and  timely manner  when  violence  and  other  crises  occur. \nMoreover,  without  adequate  numbers  of  qualified  staff,  detention \nofficers  do  not  have  the  time  to  build  the  relationships  with \nyouth  that  are  necessary  to  identify and  preempt  potential \nconflicts. \nOf  the  staffing sampling  reviewed  by  our  consultants  for \n2006  and  2007,  we  determined  that  during  waking  hours,, \napproximately  80%  of  the  units  were  staffed  substantially below \ngenerally accepted.professional  standards. 6  Specifically,  the \n16-bed units  were  typically  staffed with  a  single  dedicated  staff \nperson,  or  a  1:16  staff-to-youth ratio.  Such  staffing  levels \nduring  waking  hours  are  dangerously  inadequate,  and  make  it \ndifficult  for  staff  to  prevent  and  quickly  intervene  in youth \nassaults. \nIndeed,  incident  reports  were  full  of  examples  in which  a \nsingle  staff person was  tasked with.separating  multiple  youth \ninvolved  in assaultive  behavior.  In one  example  from  January \n2007,  a  lone  staff person was  required  to  separate  multiple  youth \ninvolved  in a  fight.  In  an  example  from  February  2007,  a  lone \nstaff person  required  the  assistance  of  three  youth  in order  to \nrestrain two  fighting  youth  until  additional  staff  assistance \narrived.  As  one  staff person  so  aptly  reported  to  us  during  an \ninterview,  \"there  are  16  of  them,  and  'I  only have  one  set  of \neyes.\" \nb.  Inadequate  Staff  Training \nIn  addition  to  adequate  numbers  of  staff,  generally accepted \nprofessional  standards  require  that  facilities  provide  staff with \nadequate  training  in behavior management,  de-escalation \ntechniques,  assault  intervention,  and  use  of  force.  That \ncurriculum  should  be  included  in both  staff pre-service  training, \n6  Generally accepted professional  standards  typically \nrequire  one  direct  care  staff  to  every  eight  to  ten youth  during \nwaking  hours,  and  one  direct  care  staff  to  every  16  to  20  youth \nduring  sleeping  hours.  At  certain  facilities,  additional \nfactors,  such  as  poor  facility layout,  may  require  additional \nstaff. \n\n- 8  -\ncurriculum  should be. included  in both  staff pre-service  training, \nand  in  the  required  annual  in-service  training.  A  lack  of \ntraining  in these  areas  hampers  the  staff's ability to  diffuse \ntensions,  discourage  and  prevent  violent  incidents,  and  safely \nand  appropriately intervene  once  an  assault  has  occurred.  Staff \nat Marion  do  not  receive  adequate  levels  of  training,  and,  in \nfact,  receive  no  pre-service  instruction in the  use  of  force \ncontinuum.  This  lack  of  training  contributes  significantly.to \nthe  violent  conditions  at  the  facility. \nIn November  2006,  Marion  contracted with  a  private  company \nto provide  eight  hours  of  in-service  training with  all  staff on \n\"Critical  Movement  Intervention.\"  This  program  included  training \non  verbal  de-escalation,  positive  interactions,  and  physical \nrestraint  techniques.  The  program  lacked  any  formal  assessment \nof  whether  staff had  learned  the  material  or  techniques,  and \ngenerally  appeared  to  be  inadequate  to  provide  staff with \nessential  skills. \nThe  gross  inadequacy  of  training  at  Marion  is  highlighted by \nour  interview with  several  staff who  were  unable  to  articulate \nwhat  they had  learned  or how  they would  apply  their  training  in a \nreal-world  setting.  In  addition,  a  review  of  incident  reports \nrevealed  that  staff were  unable  to  specify types  of \ninterventions,  and  appeared  unfamiliar with basic  use  of  force \nterminology. \nThe  amount  and  effectiveness  of  staff training  at  the \nfacility  is  a  substantial  departure  from  generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards.  Indeed,  the  paucity of  training \nopportunities  means  that  staff  are  not  adequately  equipped  to \nprevent  or  intervene  in physical  altercations  and  to  protect \nyouth  from  harm  by  others. \nc.  Inadequate  Youth  Programming· \nThe  amount  and  quality of  structured daily programming  in \njuvenile  facilities  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  rate  of \nviolent  and  antisocial  incidents.  Simply  stated,  youth  who  do \nnot  have  adequate  opportunities  to  engage  in programmed \nactivities become  bored,  and  are  more  likely to  become  involved \nin mischief  or  assaultive  behavior.  Generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards  mandate  that  youth  in  juvenile  justice \nfacilities  receive  a  minimum  of  one  hour  of  large  muscle  activity \nper  weekday,  two  hours  of  large  muscle  activity per weekend  day, \neducational  programming  during  weekdays,  and  other  structured \ndevelopmental  and  rehabilitative  activities.  Inadequate  youth \nprogramming  at  Marion  contributes  to  the  high  levels .of  youth \n\n- 9  -\nviolence and  departs  substantially from  generally  accepted \n1 \nprofessional  standards. \nYouth  at  Marion  generally  receive  only  40  minutes  of  large \nmuscle  activity per  day.  Some  youth  in  isolation  or  in various \nother  disciplinary categories  do  not  receive  educational  services \nof  any  kind.  Other  types  of  programming  are  scarce;  and  youth \nspend  a  significant  portion of  their day watching  television. \nYouth  reported  that  they  are  bored,  particularly on  the  weekends. \nDetention  officers  reported  that  low  staffing  levels prevent \nmeaningful  programming  at  the  facility. \nd.  Inadequate  Behavior  Management  Program \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  require  that \nfacilities  confining  youth  provide  effective behavior management \nsystems  in order  to  encourage  appropriate  behavior  and  discourage \nviolent  or  disruptive  behavior.  Effective  behavior management \nsystems  generally  involve  incentive-based programs  for  promoting \nappropriate  behavior  throughout  the  day and  clearly defined \n1 \nguidelines  that  are  cons,istently  applied within  the  facility. \nFor  youth  identified as  having  behavioral  problems behavior \n1 \nmanagement  programs  should  be  coordinated with  a  treatment  plan. \nThe  behavior management  program  should be  based  on  proven \ntechniques  and  focused  on  achieving  lasting change  through  the \nintegration of  evidence-based  (or  scientifically measurable) \noutcomes.  Facilities must  continuously track behaviors  of  their \nyouth  with  behavior problems  and  adjust  their behavior management \nprograms,  when  necessary to  achieve  desired  results. \n1 \nThe  behavior  management  program  at  Marion  is  poorly \nstructured and  inadequately  implemented.  The  range  of  rewards \nand .sanctions  under  the  program  are  not  adequate  to  deter \naggressive  youth  behavior,  and  therefore  contribute  significantly \nto  the  high  levels  of  violence  at  the  facility.  In  addition, \nstaff  are  not  fully  aware  of  the  features  of  the  program,  and \nstaff  and  youth  interviews  indicate  that  the  program  is \ninconsistently applied.  For  example,  when  asked  what  the  maximum \nnumber  of  points  they  could  award  a  youth  on  a  given  day,  staff \nreported vastly different  answers.  The  policy  regarding  reward \npoints  is  not  clear and  comprehensive.  In  addition,  the \npenalties· available  under  the  system  for  misbehavior  are  limited \nand  ineffective. \n\n- 10  -\ne.  Inadequate  Housing  Classification \nThe  absence  of  an  adequate  classification system guiding \nyouth housing  assignments  contributes  to  the  high  frequency  of \nyouth-on-youth  assaults  at  Marion.  Generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards  require  that  youth  be  housed  and \nsupervised  in  accordance  with  their housing  classification \nstatus.  Reliable  classification systems  take  into  consideration \nsuch  information  as  a  youth's  age,  committing  offense,  physical \nsize,  maturity,  history of  institutional violence  and  escape \nattempts,  known  enemies  or  rivals,  and  gang  membership  or \naffiliation.  In  addition,  reliable  systems  are  objective,  and \nvalidated using  historical  facility data. \nMarion  does  not  use  any  type  of  objective  classification \ninstrument.  Housing  at  the  facility  is based primarily on  age. \nYouth  of  all  different  sizes,  levels  of  maturity,  histories  of \naggression  and  violence  or  other predatory behavior  are  all \nhoused  together,  with  no  distinction between  those  who  are \npotentially vulnerable  and  those  who  are  demonstratively \npredatory.  The  current  subjective  housing  assignment  system  at \nMarion  is a  substantial  departure  from  generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards. \n2.  Use  of Isolation \nMarion's  isolation practices  substantially depart  from \ngenerally accepted professional  standards.  Marion's  use  of \nisolation is  excessive  and  lacks  essential  procedural  safeguards. \na.  Inappropriate  Use  of  Isolatio.n \nIsolation  at  a  juvenile  detention  facility  should be  used \nonly  to  the  extent  necessary  to protect  youth  from  harm  to \nthemselves  or  others,  or  to  maintain  institutional  discipline. \nGenerally  accepted  professional  standards  prohibit  the  use  of \nexcessive  isolation.  Punitive  isolation, 7  if used  at  all,  should \n7  Juvenile  justice  institutions  typically  place  youth  in \nisolation for  two  different  reasons.  Punitive  or  \"disciplinary\" \nisolation involves. placing  a  youth  alone  in  a  locked  room  as  a \nsanction or punishment  for  negative  behavior  for  a  pre-determined \nperiod of  time.  A  separate  form  of  isolation  involves  placing \nyouth  who  pose  an  immediate  and  continuing  threat  to  themselves \nor  others  alone  in a  locked  room  in order  to prevent  immediate \nself harm  or  harm  to  others.  Sometimes  this  latter form  of \nisolation is  called a  \"cool  down\"  and  should  only  last  as  long  as \n\n- 11  -\nbe  used  in  conjunction with  a  continuum  of  interventions,. \nbeginning with  techniques  such  as  verbal  re-direction and  loss  of \ncertain  privileges.  Fadilities  are  required  to  provide  isolated \nyouth with  certain services  and  programming,  such  as  medical \ncare,  mental  health  care,  daily exercise,  and  to  the  extent \nreasonably possible,  educational  services.  The  length of \npunitive  isolation should  be  proportional  to  the  offense \ncommitted. \nPrior  to  February  15,  2007,  Marion  used  three  forms  of \nisolation:  \"DOE\"  (an  orientation phase  requiring  an  initial \nthree  days  in isolation upon  admission  to  the  facility),  \"Re-DOE\" \n(essentially a  return to  the  orientation phase) ,  and  \"2H\" \n(punitive  isolation lasting  from  four  to  seven  days) .  On \nFebruary  15,  2007,  the  new  superintendent  issued  a  memo \nabolishing  DOE,  Re-DOE,  and  2H,  replacing  them  simply with \npunitive  isolation lasting  from  two  to  24  hours  and  requiring \ndiff~rent levels  of approval  at  each  increment. 8  Regardless  of \nthe  name  used  to  describe  it,  the  facility excessively relies  on \nisolation as  a  means  of  attempting  to  control  youth behavior. \nBased  on  the  review  of  housing  assignments  in January  and \nFebruary  2007,  on  any  given  day,  approximately  15  to  20  percent \nof  the  youth  population was  in  some  form  of  isolation. \nIn  addition,  staff  at  Marion  have  historically failed  to \ndistinguish violent  and  dangerous  rule  infractions  from  less \nserious  disruptive  or  annoying  behaviors.  For  example,  our \nreview  of  incident  reports  revealed  that  the  vast  majority of \nstaff  recommended  isolation as  the  sanction  for  rule violations, \ntogether with  a  reduction  in  the  youths'  behavior  management \nlevel.  These  recommended  sanctions  were  generally  the  same \nwhether  the  alleged misbehavior  included  failing  to  follow \ninstructions,  refusing  to  take  a  shower,  or  stealing  food,  as \nthe  youth  continues  to pose  an  immediate  threat,  and  is  therefore \nnecessarily  indeterminate  in duration. \n8  At  the  time  of  our  most  recent  tour  in  February  2007, \nthe  new  isolation policy had  been  in effect  for  only  three  days. \nTherefore,  there  was  an  insufficient  sampling  to  fully  evaluate \nthe  program's  effectiveness  or  implementation.  However,  the  new \npolicy appeared  to  be  severely  flawed,  suffering  from  illogical, \nredundant,  and  overlapping  guidelines,  a  lack  of  procedural \nsafeguards,  lack of  staff  training  in the  new  policy,  and  unclear \nand  disproportionate  durations  of  isolation.  In  addition,  the \nnew  policy  failed  to provide  meaningful  alternatives  to  the  use \nof  isolation. \n\n- 12  -\nwell  as  more  s~rious misbehavior  such  as  threatening  staff, \nassaulting  another youth,  or  destroying  property.  Punitive \nisolation should  never  be  the  sole  response  to misbehavior  in a \njuvenile detention  facility. 9 \nThe  facility  also  fails  to  provide  isolated youth  with \ncertain  required  services.  For  example,  youth  in  isolation do \nnot  regularly receive  mental  health  care  services,  special \neducation  services,  regular  access  to medical  care,  or  daily \nlarge  muscle  exercise.  Failtlre  to provide  youth  in isolation \nwith  essential  services  creates  an  additional  impermissible  form \nof  punishment. \nb.  Lack  of  Procedural  Protections \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  require  that  youth \nplaced  in punitive  isolation receive  notice  of  the  charges,  a \nhearing  before  an  independent  decision-maker,  and  an  opportunity \nto  present  evidence  in their defense.  Marion  fails  to  provide \nthese  important  procedural  safeguards  in  imposing  punitive \nisolation.  At  the  facility,  a  supervisor  is  required  to  review \nand  approve  the  use  of  isolation.  However,  there  is no  formal \nprocess  for  the  youth  to be  notified of  the  charges  and  their \nrights,  to dispute  the  charges,  to present  exculpatory  evidence, \nor  to  receive  consideration  from  a  neutral  decision-maker.  One \npredictable  consequence  of  this  failure  is  that Marion youth \nperceive  the  disciplinary process  to  be  unfair and  arbitrary. \n3.  Suicide  Prevention Measures \nJuvenile  justice  facilities  must  protect youth  from  self \nharm.  Youth  in detention  settings,  like  the  youth  at  Marion,  are \nat  a  much  higher  risk of  suicide  than  their  counterparts  in the \ncommunity.  For  reasons  set  forth  below,  Marion  fails  to provide \nadequate  protections  for  potentially suicidal  youth. \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  require  facilities \nto  screen youth  upon  intake  for  suicidality using  a  validated and \ndevelopmentally-appropriate  suicide  risk instrument.  In \naddition,  staff must  be  trained  to  identify warning  signs  in \nyouth  after intake,  and  to  make  appropriate  referrals  to  a \nqualified mental  health professional  (\"QMHP\").  Youth  identified \n9  Examples  of  other generally accepted disciplinary \nsanctions  short  of  isolation  include  letters  of  apology,  essay \nwriting,  community  service,  probated  sanctions,  and  loss  of \ncertain privileges. \n\n- 13  -\nqualified mental  health professional  (\"QMHP\").  Youth  identified \nas  potentially suicidal  must  be  subject  to  a  number  of \nprecautions,  including  heightened  staff  supervision,  recurring \ncontact  with  QMHPs,  suicide  resistant  housing,  and  frequent  staff \nsearches  for  any  restricted or  dangerous  items. \nGenerally  accepted  professional  standards  also  require  that, \ndepending  on  the  severity of  the  risk,  QMHPs  may· order  heightened \nsupervision from  a  continuum of  close  observation,  generally  four \n.randomly-timed  (unpredictable)  checks  per hour,  to  one-on-one \nconstant  supervision.  After  a  youth  has  initially been \nidentified as  potentia~ly suicidal,  only  a  QMHP  may  remove  that \nyouth  from  p~ecautions,  or  lower  the  level  of  precautions  for \nthat  youth.  Youth  on  a  high  level  of  suicide  precautions  should \nbe  gradually  \"stepped-down\"  to  lower  levels,  rather  than being \nabruptly removed. \nMarion's  policies  and  practices  regarding  suicide  prevention \nare  inadequate  t_o  protect  youth  from  self-harm.  Staff  conduct \nperiodic welfare  checks  in predictable  intervals.  Moreover,  the \nexisting policy  fails  to  provide  for  welfare  checks  during  waking \nhours.  Additionally,  the  facility  fails  to  adequately  document \nor preserve  evidence  that  welfare  checks  are  performed.  For \nexample,  Marion  was  unable  to produce  youth  observation  forms  for \nany  of  the  15  youth  on  suicide  precautions  we  requested. 10  Youth \nCounselors  at  Marion  routinely make  decisions  regarding \nprecautions  and  treatment  of  suicidal  youth,  rather  than  QMHPs; \nIn  addition,  youth  on  a  high  leve:)_  of  precautions  are  sometimes \nabruptly removed,  without  any  step-down. \nStaff  at  Marion  receive  only minimal  training  in suicide \nprevention  and  intervention,  and  staff  routinely  ignore  warning \nsigns  and  act  inappropriately  in  response  to  suicidal  ideations, \ngestures,  and  attempts.  Most  staff were  unable  to  articulate how \nthey would  respond  if they  observed  a  youth  hanging,  and  were \nunaware  if  the  facility had  a  cut  down  tool. 11  One  recent \nexample  demonstrates  numerous  failures  to  implement  an  adequate \nsuicide prevention  system  over  a  period  of  several  months: \n10  Although  some  staff· and  youth  reported  that \nobservations  were  being  recorded  on  observation  forms,  we  were \nunable  to  corroborate  this  with  any  documentary  evidence. \n11  Cut  d6wn  tools  are  specialty blades  used  in \ncorrectional  settings  to  quickly  cut  down  hanging  inmates.  These \ntool~ are  specially designed to minimize  the  danger  that  the \nblade  will  be  used  as  an  improvised weapon. \n\n- 14  -\n•  On  June  25,  2006,  a  youth.  [EL]  tied  a  sheet  to  the  sprinkler \nhead  in his  room  and  was  attempting  to  tie  it around  his \nneck  when  staff  intervened.  [EL]  was  not  assessed by  the \nYouth  Counselor  until  five  days  later,  on  June  30th,  when  he \nwas  placed  on pink  card  status, 12  but  was  then  removed  from \nsuicide  precautions  on  July  5th.  On  July  7th,  [EL]  again \ntried.to hang  himself  using  a  sheet,  and  in response  he  was \nplaced back;on pink  card  status.  Despite  being  on. a \nsupposedly  enhanced  level  of  supervision,  the  next  day  he \nattempted  to  tie  a  sheet  around  his  neck  twice,  and \natte[11pted  to  place  his  head  in  a  s.ink  full  of  water. \nFinally,  h~ was  traI1sferred  to  a  psychiatric hospital  on \nJuly  8th. \nLater  in  the  month,  [EL]  returned to  Marion  from  the \nhospital.  On  July 22nd,  staff  observed  him  banging  his  head \nagainst  the  wall  on  two  separate  occasions.  On  July  24th, \nthe  youth  verbalized a  plan  to  jump  off  the  second  tier of \nthe  unit.  On  July  28th,  the  youth  actually  jumped  off  the \ntier.  The  Shift  Manager  \"advised  [EL]  of  the  negative \nconsequences  of  his  behavior.\"  On  July  29th,  the  youth \njumped  from  the  second  tier again,  this  time  with  a  sheet .. \ntied around  his  neck,  and  \"was  informed  he  would  receive \nadditional  discipline.\"  On  July  31st,  [EL]  tied a  shirt \naround  his  neck  and,  in a  separate  incident,  placed his  head \nin  a  sink  full  of  water.  Another  round  of  similar  incidents \noccurred  in November  2006.  For  the  July  31st  and  November \n2006  incidents,  there was  no  record  that  [EL]  was  seen by  a \nQMHP  or  that  a  safety plan was  created  to  prevent  him  from \nhurting  himself.  Further,  observation  forms  could  not  be \nproduced  for  any  of  these  time  periods,  and  thus  the \nfacility  cannot  demonstrate  that  the  youth  received  any \nenhanced  supervision  in  response  to  these  repeated  serious \ngestures. \nMarion  also  fails  to protect  suicidal  youth  from \nenvironmental  hazards  or  contraband.  The  facility  fails  to \nreasonably  ensure  that  the  youths'  environment  and  person  are \nfree  of  items  that  could be  used  in  self-harm attempts.  Staff  do \nnot  receive  clear  instructions  on  what  items  a  suicidal  youth  may \npossess.  For  example,  in  February  2007,  a  youth  [UK]  was  on \ncautionary  status  after stating his  intent  to  kill  himself.  On \ntwo  different  occasions,  he  was  found  with  a  length of  string  in \nthe  padded  room  in which  he  had  been  placed.  For  a  second \n12  Pink  card  status  requires  staff  at  Marion. to  record \nobservations  of  the youth  every  15  minutes  during  sleeping  hours. \n\n- 15  -\nexample,  in January  2007,  a  nurse  determined  that  all  of  another \nyouth's  [TU]  belongings  and  clothing  should be  removed  to  protect \nthe  youth's  safety.  The  nurse  returned  to  the  unit  two  hours \nlater to  find  that  staff  had  given  [TU]  all  of  her  belongings \nback. \n4.  Grievances \nThe  dysfunctional  grievance  system  at  Marion  contributes  to \nthe  facility's  failure  to  ensure  a  reasonably  safe  environment. \nAn  adequately  functioning  grievance  system ensures  that  youth \nhave  an  avenue  for  bringing  serious  allegations  of  abuse  and \nother  complaints  to  the  attention of  the  administration.  It also \nprovides  an  important  tool  in evaluating  the  culture  at  the \nfacility,  and  alerting  the  administration  about  dangers  and  other \nproblems  in the  facility's  operations. \nYouth  should have  timely  access  to  the  grievance  system,  and \ngrievances  should be  reasonably  confidential.  Grievances  should \nbe  tracked,  audited,  and  periodically reviewed by  senior \nmanagement  in order to  identify patterns  and  problems. \nGrievances  should be  responded  to  in  a  timely manner,  and  youth  ·~, \nshould  be  informed  about  how  their grievance  was  resolved~ \nAlthough Marion  has  invested  in technology  to  improve  the \ngri~vance.process at  the  facility,  the  s~~tem remains  a \nsubstantial  departure  from  generally accepted professional \nstandards. \nFirst,  the  Marion  grievance  system  relies heavily on  five \n\"Student  Concern  Phones\"  located outside  of  the  youth housing \nunits  in certain common  areas  of  the  facility.  Several  youth, \nparticularly those  in  isolation or  restricted housing,  complained \nthat  the  Student  Concern  Phones  were  not  accessible  to  them,  or \nthat  limited  staffing  in  their units  inhibited their ability to \naccess  the  phones. \nSecond,  although  the  Student  Concern  Phone  is  an  important \ntool  in Marion's  grievance  system,  youth  should  also  have \nadditional  avenues  for  reporting  concerns  or  allegations.  For \nexample,  youth  witness  statements  in  incident  reports  should \nprovide  an  additional  avenue  for  reporting  staff misconduct  or \nabuse.  Youth  at  Marion  do  not  have  the  opportunity  to provide \nwritten  statements  in connection  with  an  incident.  Currently, \nstaff  interview youth  involved  in an  incident,  and  then  write  a \nsummary  of  the  youth's  statement  on the  incident  report.  This \npractice  creates  the  possibility that  staff may,  purposefully or \ninadvertently,  misrepresent  or.misinterpret  the  youth's \nstatements.  While  the  current  practice may  be  appropriate  in \n\n- 16  -\ncertain  situations where  youth  lack  the  ability to write,  youth \nshould  first  be  offered  the  opportunity to  complete  their own \nstatement. \nThird,  the  Marion  grievance  system also violates  generally \naccepted professional  standards  because  youth  are  often not \ninformed  of  how  their particular grievance  was  resolved.  For \nexample,  when  a  grievance  is  determined by  a  Marion  administrator \nto  be  unfounded  or not  grievable,  the  administrator  fails  to \ninform  the  youth.  One  obvious  consequence  of  the  lack of  follow \nthrough  is  that  youth  lose  confidence  that  their grievance  has \nbeen  reviewed  or given  serious  consideration. \n5.  Child Abuse  Reporting  and  Investigations \na.  Mandated  Reporting \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  and  State  law13 \nrequire  personnel  at  Marion  to  report  all  allegations  of  child \nabuse  to  appropriate  external  social  services  and  law  enforcement \nagencies.  Personnel  must  report  all  allegations,  and may  not \nfilter  reporting  of  the  allegations  based  on  the  perceived \nc~edibility of  the  youth,  or merit  of  the  allegations.i• \nProfessional  standards  also  mandate  that  once  an  allegation \nof  child abuse  has  been  received,  management  must  restrict  the. . , \naccused  staff member  from  contact  with youth,  pending  the  outcome \nof  the  referral  and  investigation. \nMarion practices  substantially depart  from  professional \nstandards.  Supervisory  personnel  at  the  facility  routinely  fail \nto  report  allegations  that  they  subjectively determine  not \n13  See  Ind.  Code  §31-33-5-1  (\"an  individual  who  has  reason \nto  believe  that  a  child  is  a  victim of  child abuse  or neglect \nshall  make  a  report  as  required by  this  article.\"). \n14  Social  service  and  investigative  agencies  routinely \n\"screen-out\"  child  abuse  allegations  based  on  lack  of  credibility \nor  evidence.  Staff  at  these  agencies  provide  an  objective  and \nnon-involved perspective  on  the  merit  of  the  allegations,  and  are \nspecifically trained  in  investigating  allegations  of  abuse. \nConversely,  investigations  by Marion  personnel  do  not  share  these \nqualities. \n\n- 17  -\ncredible.15  In  addition,  because  the  allegations  are, often not \ndetermined  to  be  credible,  the  accused  staff  are  not  subsequently \nplaced on  non-contact  status  pending  the  investigation.  For \nexample,  the  following  incidents  did  not  result  in any  external \nreporting,  and  did  not  result  in any  attempt  to  remove  the \naccused  staff  from  direct  youth  supervision: \n•  During  our  second  tour,  a  youth  reported  to  us  that  a  Youth \nManager  had  sprayed  him  in the  face  with  bleach  in  response \nto  his  misbehavior  the  day  before.  The  youth  indicated that \none  of  the  facility  supervisors  talked  to  him  about  what  had \nhappened  and  that  he  [the  youth]  reported  the  incident  as  he \nreported  it to  us.  The  youth  also  stated that  he  was  not \nseen  by  medical  staff  following  the  incident.  We  located \nthe  incident  report,  and  indeed,  the  supervisor  recorded  the \nyouth1 s  allegation that  he  was  sprayed  in  the  face  with \nbleach.  We  were  told that  the  incident  was  not  forwarded  to \nChild  Protective  Services  because  staff did  not  believe  the \nallegation was  true,  indicating  that  because  the  youth \n\"could open  his  eyesn  after the  inciderit,  the  episode  could \nnot  have  happened. \n•  An  incident  report  from  mid-February  2007  indicated that  a· \nstaff  person  observed  a  youth  with  a  bloody  nose  say  to \nanother  youth,  \"staff hit me  a_nd  you  are  going  to  be  my \nwitriess.n  The  reporting  staff  felt  that  the  instruction ~o \nthe  other youth  was  evidence  of  collusion and  that  the  youth \nwith  the  bloody  nose  was  lying  about  what  occurred.  The \nyouth  was  disciplined  \"for trying  to  get· staff  in trouble. 11 \nThere  was  no  record of  the  youth  receiving  any  type  of \nmedical  treatment. \n•  Two  different  youth  called the  Student  Concern  Phone \nalleging  that  a  particular staff person  threatened  to  harm \nthem  in  separate  incidents.  While  a  single  allegation \nshould have  been  sufficient  to  trdgger  a  report  to  Child \nProtective  Services,  the  fact  that  the  reported  threats  were \nso  si~ilar  (\"I 1 m going  to  slap  the  shit  out  of  you!n)  is \nadditional  cause  for  concern.  These  threats  were  not \n15  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  former  facility  director has \nbeen  criminally  charged  for  failing  to  report  allegations  that  a \nfemale  youth  in his  charge  was  raped  by  a  staff person.  The \nformer  director has  publicly  indicated  that  he  did-not  report  the \nallegations  because  he  did not  perceive  the  allegations  to be \ncredible.'  As  of  this writing,  the  former  superintendent  is \nawaiting  trial. \n\n- 18  -\nreported  to  Child  Protective  Services,  and  disciplinary \naction amounted  to  telling the  staff person  that  \"she  should \nnot  play  this  way  with  any  student  as  she  makes  herself  an \neasy  target.\" \nb.  Facility  Internal  Inve$tigations \nCertain  allegations  of  staff misconduct,  including \nallegations  of  child abuse  screened-out  or  found  unsubstantiated \nby  external  agencies,  should  nevertheless  be  investigated \ninternally for  misconduct  that  does  not  rise to  a  criminal  level. \nMarion  recently  implemented  an  internal  facility-based \ninvestigatory process  to  gather  evidence  and  review  employee \nconduct.  At  the  time  of  our  tour  in  February  2007,  the  facility \nhad  conducted  one  such  investigation . \n. The  resulting  investigative  report  revealed  a  number  of \nsignificant  inadequacies  in the  internal  investigations  process. \nSpecifically: \n•  Factual  errors  (e.g.,  the  report  indicates  that  a  single \nmedical  staff person  received  the  allegation  from  the  youth, \nbut  the  various  attachments  reveal  that  the  youth  reported \nthe  incident  to  at  least  three  other  staff) .  · \n•  Failures  to  interview key  witnesses  (e.g.,  the  accused  staff \nperson provided  a  written  statement  but  was  never \ninterviewed;  the  youth  reported  that  two  other girls,  since \nreleased  from  the  facility,  were  also mistreated by  the \naccused  staff person,  but  they were  never  interviewed;  the \nstaff  members  who  received  the  allegations provided written \nstatements  but  were  never  interviewed). \n•  Poorly written narrative  (e.g.,  several  unclear  references, \npoor  grammar,  spelling  and  punctuation  errors,  not  well \norganized  so  the  flow  of  information  is difficult  to \ndiscern) . \nA  properly  functioning  internal  investigation  system  is \nessential  to  ensure  that  staff  are  held  accountable  for  any \npolicy violations  or provided  with  any  additional  necessary \ntraining  or re-training,  and  that  youth  are  treated \nappropriately. \n\n- 19  -\nB.  FIRE  SAFETY  AND  SANITA.TTON \nThe  environmental  health  and  safety  conditions  at  Marion \npose  a  signifi6ant  risk of  disease  and  injury to youth  and  staff. \nWe  identified deficiencies  in  the  areas  of  fire  safety,  general \nsanitation,  and  general  safety. \n1.  Fire  Safety \nWe  identified  several  deficiencies  in Marion's  fire \nsuppression and  evacuation  systems  and procedures.  For  example, \nMarion  does  not  adequately  conduct  or  document  fire  drills.  Fire \nalarm boxes  are  key  activated,  as  opposed  to manually  pulled,  but \nnot  all  employees  have  keys  to  the  alarm boxes  to  activate  the \nfire  alarm  system.  Delays  in fire  notification can  have  deadly \nconsequences.  We  found  very heavy  lint  and  dust  accumulation  on \nall  surfaces  in the  main  laundry  room.  High  concentrations  of \nlint  and  dust  can  create  explosive  fire  hazards  around  electrical \nequipment,·  such  as  washer  and  dryer motors.  Additional  fire \nsafety hazards  include  a  emergency  exit  door;  fire \nblo~ked \nextinguishers  not  properly  secured  to  the  wall;  an  overloaded \n~ \nelectrical  receptacle  holding·nine  devices;  missing  sprinkler \nheads;  and  surge  protectors  ·connected  in a  series.  These \nconditions  pref?ent  numerous  scenarios  fpr  harm  to  youth  and \nstaff. \n2.  General  Sanitation \nThe  laundry  facilities  do  not  adequately  clean  and  sanitize \nyouths'  clothing,  which  increases  the  risk of  transmitting \ninfectious  diseases,  such  as·methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus \naureus  ( \"MRSA\") 16  and  scabies,  a  pruri tic  rash· caused  by  the  skin \nmite  Sarcoptes  scabiei.  Youths'  laundered  clothing  often  is \nreturned  to  them wet,  which  indicates  that  dryer  temperature \nsettings  and/or  time  cycles  are  insufficient .to  ensure  the \ndestruction of  pathogens,  including MRSA,  and. resuits  in an \nincreased  risk  of  disease  transmission  through  the  sharing of \ncontaminated  clothing.  Youths'. laundered  clothing  is also \n16  MRSll~  is  a  virulent  staph  infection that  thrives  in \nclose  populations. such  as  j:uvenile  justice  facilities,  prisons, \nand  medi9al  facilities.  ~RSA is  resistant  to  traditional \nantibiotics,  and  can  cause  s~vere reactions,  usually after a \nstr.ain of bacteria  enters  the  body  through  an  opening  or break  in \nthe  skin.  An  untreated  infection of  MRSA  can  cause  swelling, \nboils,  blisters,  fever,  pneumonia,  bloodstream.infections,  and \neventually loss  of  limbs  and  even  death. \n\n- 20  -\ntransported  in  the  same  laundry  carts  that  are  used  for  soiled \ncloth1ng,  which  further  exacerbates  the  risk of  disease \ntransmissiOn. \nNumerous  mattresses,  pillows,  and  safety mats  were  worn  or \ntorn  and  could  not  be  adequately  cleaned  and  sanitized. \nMattresses  and  pillows  in this  condition  can  easily aid  in  the \ntransmission  of  bacteria  and  diseases  such  as  scabies  and  MRSA. \nYouth  are  further  at  risk of  disease  transmission  through \nMarion's  practice  of  requiring youth  on  most  housing  units  to \nshare  a  single  bottle  of  roll-on deodorant  on  the  unit.  This \npractice  may  be  contributing to  the  spread  of  scabies  in the \nfacility.  The  Sarcoptes  scabiei  mite  can  be  transferred person \nto-person by  sharing  the  same  deodorant  bottle. \nMarion's  shower  areas  in  the  housing  units  are  not \nadequately  clean.  Some  housing  units  had  fly  infestations  irt  the \nshower  drains,  which  may  exacerbate  bronchial  asthma  in \nsusceptible  populations  and  indicate  inadequate  sanitation.  Some \nshower  areas  had  peeling paint  and  mold  and  mildew  growths  on  the \nwalls.  Peeling  paint  increases  the  risk of  bacteria  and  mold \ngrowth.  Building  dampness  or moldiness  has  b.een  linked with \nrespiratory health problems  such  as  cough,  wheeze,  and  asthma \nexacerbation.  Respiratory health  risks  may  become  particularly \nhigh  when  such  fungal  growth  occurs  inside  a  building. \n3.  General  Safety \n·chemical  safety was  also  inadequate  at  Marion.  For  example, \nwe  observed  numerous  instances  of  unsecured,  unsupervised \nchemicals,  including bleach,  in housing  and  education areas. \nThis  poses  a  significant  risk of  harm  to youth  and  staff  through \naccidental  or  intentional  spill~.  Additionally,  chemicals  were \nnot  accompanied  by  accurate  Material  Safety Data  Sheets  (\"MSDS\"), \nand  some  chemicals  had  no  MSDS  sheeis.  In  one  instance,  an \nunidentified  chemical  in a  five-gallon  container  was  being  used \nto  prop  open  a  door.  Without  MSDS  sheets,  personnel  may  not  be \nable  to  adequately  respond  in case  of  chemical  exposure  or other \nchemical-related  injury. \nMarion  also  places  youth  at  risk of  accidents  by  creating \nunacceptable  safety hazards.  For  example,  the  sea.ts  on  the \nsmall,  four-seat  fixed-metal  tables  in  five  housing  units  were \nbroken,  exposing  the  sharp  metal  seat  mounts.  This  poses  a  very \nserious  risk of  accidental  or  intentional  harm  to  youth.  A  trip \nor  fall  in  the  area  of  the  table  could produce  a  fatal  injury  if \nsomeone's  head  struck  the  seat  mount.  The  seat  mounts  could  also \n\n- 21  -\nsomeone's  head  struck the  seat mount.  The  seat  mounts  could  also \nbe  used  as  weapons  to  inflict youth-on-youth  injury. \nC.  SPECIAL  EDUCATION \nYouth  with  certain disabilities  have  federal  statutory \nrights  to  special  education  services  under  the  Individuals  with \nDisabilities  Educ;:ation.Act.  In  states  that  accept  federal  funds \nfor  the  education  of  youth  with  disabilities,  such  as  Indiana, \nthe  requirements  of  the  IDEA  apply  to  juvenile  justice \nfacilities.  See  20  U.S.C.  1412 (a) (1);  34  C.F.R. \n§  300 .2 (b)  (1)  (iv).  Marion violates  the  IDEA  by  failing  t() \nadequately deliver  required  special  education  services  and  by \ndenying  access  to  any  educational  services  to  certain youth. \n1.  Special  Education  Program \nEven  when  youth have  access  to  the  education  program,  the \nspecial  education program  is  inadequate. \na.  Screening \nThe  facility appears  to be  under-identifying  the  number  of \nyouth  who  are  eligible  for  special .education  services.  Of  the \n124  youth  in  custody during  our  February  2007  visit,  only  30  were \nidentified as  eligible  for  special  education  services.17  This  is \n24  percent  of  the  youth population,  whic:h  is  significantly lower \nthan  the  40  to  60  percent  which,  in our  consultant's  experience, \nare  commonly  identified in  juvenile  detention  and  correctional \nfacilities. \nb.  Education  Staffing \nMarion  has  one  special  education  teacher.  Even  with  the \nrelatively low  number  of  identified eligible youth,  it iq \nunlikely  that  a  _single  special  education  teacher  could provide \nthe  services  required by  their  Indiv{dualized  Education  Programs \n( \"IEPs\") .  Special  education youth  at  Marion  are  served  in \nRegular  Class  se~tings  (served  in a  special  education  setting £or \n0-20%  of  the  school  day),  in a  Resource  setting  (served  in  a \nspecial  education  setting for  21-60%  of  the  school  day),  or  in  a \nSeparate  Class  setting'  (served  in a  special  education  setting  for \nmore  than  609s  of  the  school  day) .  A  single  teacher  is  simply not \n17  Nineteen  of  these  youth  were  enrolled  in  school;  an \nadditional  11  youth were  eligible  for  special  education  services, \nbut  had  not  been  enrolled.  -\n\n- 22  -\n·able to  provide  for  the  diversity of  needs  among  the  youth \npopulation at  a  relatively  large  detention  facility  like Marion. \nEven  with  the  currently  small  number  of  identified  eligible \nyouth,  at  some  point,  the  single  teacher's  class  size would \nexceed  generally accepted  professional  standards. 18 \nc.  Individualized  Education  Plans \nThe  IDEA  requires  that  each youth  qualified  for  special \neducation  services  have  an  Individualized Education  Plan,  and \ndescribes  the  I:g!P  components  required  to  ensure  that  each youth \nreceives  adequate  special  education  services.  34  C.F.R. \n§§  300.346,  300.347.  The  30  youth  identified as  eligible  for \nspecial  education  services  at  Marion  had  IEPs  that  were  prepared \nbefore  their detention  at  the  facility.  However,  Marion  fails  to \nensure  that  these  IEPs  are  updated  and  appropriate  for  each \nyouth.  Neither  the  Director of  Alternative  Education  for \nIndianapolis  Public  Schools  nor  the  school  principal  could \nremember  a  single  situation  in which  a  youth's  IEP  was  outdated \nand  required  a  case  conference  to  make  it current.  However,  a \nreview  of  just  five  randomly  selected  IEPs  revealed  several  in \nwhich  the  IEP  appeared  to  be  expired at  the  time  of  admission, \nyet  MDJDC  had  taken  no  action  to  review  or update  the  document. \n•  One  youth  [UK]  was  in custody  from  January  11  through March \n8,  2007,  or  40  school  days.  The  youth's  previous  IEP  had \nexpired  approximately  nine  months  prior to  the  youth's \nadmission.  No  current  IEP  was  located  among  the  documents \nprovided by  the  MDJDC. \n•  Another  youth  [UX]  was  in  custody  from  January  22  to \nFebruary  26,  2007,  or  26  school  days.  Her  most  recent  case \nconference revising  her  IEP  was  held  on  March  23,  2005,  and \nthus  had  expired well  over  a  year prior to  her  admission  to \nMarion.  Again,  no  documentation  was  provided  to  indicate \nany  action had  been  taken  to  update  the  youth's  IEP. \n•  Another  youth  [CT]  was  in  custody  from  January  28  to \nFebruary  27,  2007,  or  22  school  days.  The  most  recent  case \nconference  to update  her  IEP  was  held  on  January  17,  2006. \nThis  IEP  expired  just  prior to  the  youth's  admission  to \nMDJDC,  and  yet  no  documentation  was  provided  to  indicate \nthat  any  action had  been  taken  to  update  the  youth's  IEP. \n18  The  acceptable  class  size  will  vary based  on  the  needs \nof  the  youth,  but  generally  ranges  from  ten  to  twenty  students \nper  class. \n\n- 23  -\nAll  actions  taken  on  behalf  of  a  youth  need  to be  clearly \ndocumented  in the  youth's  file.  Even  when  another  school  is \nresponsible  for  the  action  itself,  the  school  that  is presently \nserving  the  youth  should  receive  frequent  progress  reports  to \nensure  the  documents  needed  to  certify eligibility and  to  direct \nservice  provision  are  in compliance  with  State  and  federal  law. \nSchool  administrators  also  indicated  that  they were  unable \n1\nto provide  speech,  language,  and  other  types  of  related services, \nand  could not  accommodate  youth  who  required  assistive  devices  or \ntechnology.  Administrators  stated that  the  facility did  not  have \naccess  to  qualified  consultq.nts  or  assistive  equipment.  Services \nprescribed by  a  youth's  IEP  cannot  be  denied  by  the  facility. \n2.  Access  to  Education \nThe  IDEA  requires  that  all youth  with  certain disabilities \nhave  access  to  free  and  appropriate  public  education  (FAPE)  which \nmeets  the  standard  of  the  State  education  agency.  20  U.S.C. \n§ §  14 O1  ( 8 ) ( b)  [ e ff .  Ju 1 y  1 ,  2 OO  5  ] ;  2 O  U . S . C .  § §  14 O1  ( 9 )  ( b) ; \n1412 (a) (1)  (A).  See  also  34  C.F.R.  §  300.600 (a) (2)  (ii).  However, \nMarion  routinely  fails  to  provide  certain categories  of  youth \nwith  access  to  any  educational  services,  including  special \neducation.  Some  youth  in  isolation are  denied  any educational \nservices.  Similarly,  youth who  are  sche.duled  to  be  releas_ed  to \nthe  Department  of  Corrections  (\"DOC\")  do  not  attend  any  school. \n··.;,. \nFinally,  Marion  does  not  provide  any  speciai  education  services \nto girls unless  at  least  two  girls  are  eligible  for  the  services. \nThese  practices  can  severely impact  a  youth's  education. \nFor  example: \n•  We  identified 25  youth  (20%  of  the  total  youth population at \nMarion)  who  had  been  at  the  facility  for  more  than  three \ndays  and  who  were  not  enrolled  in  school. 19  Eleven  of  these \n25  youth were  eligible  for  special  education  services,  but \nwere  not  receiving  them. \n•  Two  youth,  [OB]  and  [QN]  ,  had  been  at  the  facility  for  19 \ndays  and  35  days,  respectively,  and  were  eligible  for \nspecial  education  se~vices under  the  Other Health  Impaired \ncategory,  but  neither' had  been  enrolled  in school. \n19  Three  days  is the  generally accepted  standard  for  the \nperiod  of  time  in which  youth  must  be  enrolled  in  school \nfollowing  admission  to  a  juvenile  justice  facility. \n\n- 24  -\n•  Two  youth  with  learning disabilities,  [SC]  and  [IT],  had \nbeen  at  the  facility  for  21  days  and  29  days,  respectively, \nbut  neither  had  been  enrolled  in s.chool. \n•  One  youth  [KI]  had  resided  at Marion  for  105  days,  yet  had \nnever  been  enrolled  in school. \nMarion's  failure  to  provide  access  to  any  educational \nservices  for  some  youth,  including  special  education,  violates \nyouths'  rights  to  access  to  education.  Even  when  youth .have \naccess  to  an  edvcational  program,  the  program  is  inadequate. \nMarion  provides  a  total  of  260  minutes  of  academic  instruction \ndaily,  which  is  less  that  the  360  minutes  of  instruction required \nby  state  law.  Ind.  Code  §  20-30-2-2.  Marion  attempts  to \nrationalize  this  disparity by  claiming  that  the  entire  school  has \nbeen  designated  as  an Alternative  School,  which  requires  fewer \ninstructional  hours.  However,  a  blanket  decision  to  enroll  all \nyouth  in an Alternative  Program  fails  to  account  for  the \nindividual  needs  of  youth  and  appears  to.be  a  decision made \npurely for  the  convenience  of  the  facility  rather  than  on  the \nneeds  of  the  youth.  Indeed,  some  youth  at MDJDC  who  have  been  on \ntrack for  high  school  graduation  could be  derailed by  a  stay at \nMDJDC,  as  the  facility cannot  accommodate  their course  of  study ... \nIV.  REMEDIAL  MEASURES \nIn  order  to  rectify the  identified deficiencies  and  protect \nthe  constitutional  and  statutory rights  of  youth  confined  at \nMarion,  this  facility  should  implement,  at  a  minimum,  the \nfollowing  remedial  measures: \nA.  Protection  from  Youth  Violence \n1.  Ensure  that  youth  are  adequately protected  from \nphysical  violence  committed  by  other youth. \n2.  Ensure  that  the  facility maintains  sufficient  levels  of \nadequately  trained direct-care  staff  to  supervise  youth \nsafely. \n3.  Ensure  that  staff  receive  adequate  pre-service  and  in \nservice training  in behavior  management,  de-escalation \ntechniques,  assault  intervention,  and  suicide \nprevention. \n4.  Ensure  that  the  facil·ity provides  adequate  and \nappropriate  structured youth  programming. \n\n- 25  -\n5.  Ensure  that  tnere  is  an  adequate  and  effective  behavior \nmanagement  system  in place,  and  that  the  system  is \nregularly  reviewed  and  modified  in  accordance  with \nevidence-based principles. \n6.  Ensure  that  the  facility  develops  and  implements  an \nadequate  objective  housing  classification system  to \nensu;r:-e  sq.fe  pausing  assignments. \nB.  Protection  from  Excessive  and  Unlawful  Isolation \n1.  Ensure  that youth  at  the  facility  are  not  isolated  for \nexcessive  periods  of  time  or  in an  arbitrary or \ndisproportionate  manner. \n2.  Ensure  that  youth  sanctioned  to punitive  isolation \nreceive  adequate  procedural  safeguards. \n3.  Ensure  that  youth  sanctioned  to  punitive  isolation \nreceive  adequate  programming  and  essential  services. \nC.  Suicide  Prevention Measures \n1.  Develop  adequate  suicide  prevention.policies  and \npractices. \n-\n2.  Perform·required observation  checks  in random \nintervals.  Record  the  checks  and  verify that  the \nchecks  are  occurring. \n3.  Provide  cut  down  tools  in  all  hous~ng units. \nD.  Protection  from  General  Harm \n1.  Ensure  that  the  facility  develops  and  maintains  an \nadequate  youth  grievance  system. \n2.  Ensure  that  all  allegations  of  child abuse  and \nmistreatment  are  ref erred  to  the  appropriate  external \nagency. \n3.  Ensure  that  the  facility  adequately  and  timely \ninvestigates  serious  incidents  and  allegations  of  staff \nmisconduct. \n\n- 26  -\nE.  Fire  Safety \n1.  Conduct  and  document  adequate  fire  drills. \n2.  Ensure  that  all  employees  have  keys  to  the  fire  alarm \nboxes. \n3.  Ensure  that  fire  hazards  are  eliminated. \nF.  General  Sanitation \n1.  Ensure  that  youths'  clothing  is properly  cleaned, \ndried,  and  transported. \n2.  Ensure  that  hygiene  practices  minimize  the  risk of \ndisease  transmission  (e.g.,  that  youth  do  not  share \ndeodorant) . \n3.  Ensure  that  all  mattresses,  pillows  and  gym  pads  are \nadequately cleaned  and  disinfected. \n4.  Ensure  regular  and  periodic  cleaning of  all  housing \nareas,  including  toilets  and  showers.  Ensure  that \nregular  and  periodic  insect  control  measures  are \nperformed. \nG.  General  Safety \n1.  Develop  and  implement  proper  chemical  safety measures. \n2.  Ensure  that  safety hazards  are  eliminated. \nH.  Special  Education \n1.  Ensure  timely  and  appropriate  assessment  and \nidentification of  youth  qualified for  special  education \nservices; \n2.  Provide  qualified youth  with  adequate  special  education \ninstruction,  by  an  adequate  number  of  special  education \nteachers. \n3.  Develop,  revise  as  appropriate,  and.implement  adequate \nIndividualized Education  Plans  and  provide  necessary \nrelated  services. \n4.  Provide  adequate  access  to  educational  services. \n\n- 27  -\n*  *  * \nPlease  note  that  this  findings  letter is  a  public  document. \nIt will  be  posted  on  the  Civil  Rights  Division's  website.
