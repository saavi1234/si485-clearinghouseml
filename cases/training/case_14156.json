On January 18, 2011, the DOJ published their findings that the TPJDC violated youth's civil rights and that youth were harmed by (1) physical and sexual misconduct by staff; (2) excessive physical restraints when lesser forms of punishment would be appropriate; (3) inappropriate use of chemical agents; (4) excessive use of isolation; and (5) inadequate suicide prevention.</p><p>On October 4, 2011, the United States filed suit in the Eastern District of Louisiana against Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government, who owned and operated TPJDC, under 42 U.S.C. § 14141. The complaint alleged the harms identified in the findings letter. The United States sought equitable and declaratory relief, as well as a permanent injunction against further participation in the alleged acts.</p><p>The same month, negotiations began between the parties. They submitted a settlement agreement to the Court on October 19, 2011. The agreement was approved by Judge Helen G. Berrigan on October 31, 2011 and the case was dismissed. The settlement agreement included provisions to cure the alleged violations. It also included terms for monthly reports produced by monitor documenting statistics, trends, and corrective actions. The agreement would terminate once the United States certified that the Parish was in substantial compliance with all of the provisions of the settlement for twelve consecutive months.</p><p>On November 19, 2014, the Court issued an order of final dismissal terminating the settlement agreement and dismissing the case with prejudice.</p>",

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \n \n \nAssistant Attorney General \n950 Pennsylvania Ave, NW - RFK  \nWashington, DC  20530 \n \n \n \n \n       January  18, 2011 \n \n \nBY FIRST CLASS MAIL  \n \nThe Honorable Michel Claudet \nPresident, Terrebonne Parish \n8026 Main Street, Suite 700 \nHouma, LA  70360 \n \nRe:  Terrebonne Parish Juvenile Detention Center, Houma, Louisiana  \n \nDear Mr. Claudet: \n \n  I write to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation of conditions at \nthe Terrebonne Parish Juvenile Detention Center (“Terrebonne” or \"the Facility\").  On \nNovember 19, 2009, we notified Parish officials of our intent to conduct an investigation of \nTerrebonne pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 14141 (“Section 14141”). Section 14141 gives the Department of Justice authority to seek a \nremedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory \nrights of youth in juvenile justice institutions.  \n \nSummary of Findings \n \n  The youth confined to Terrebonne are subjected to conditions that place them at serious \nrisk of avoidable harm in violation of their rights protected by the Constitution of the United \nStates. During our investigation, we received a significant number of credible reports of sexual \nand physical misconduct by staff members on youth within their custody.  The allegations \nexposed wide-spread and systemic abuses and revealed a lack of accountability and controls that \nwould have prevented harm to the young people confined there. \n \n  Allegations of sexual misconduct have led to criminal charges against seven staff \nmembers.  Our findings are not limited to the conduct charged in the criminal cases, but include \nnumerous additional accounts.  These incidents are compounded by a lack of systems in place to \nidentify and correct misconduct.   \n \n  In addition to sexual misconduct, there is a pervasive atmosphere of excessive force and \nviolence. We found: \n \n\n- 2 - \n \n   Physical restraints, including handcuffing and a restraint chair, are routinely used when \nverbal or non-physical methods would have been adequate; \n   The inappropriate and dangerous use of chemical agents; \n   Excessive use of isolation as punishment or for control;  \n   Suicidal behavior six times the national average and an inadequate suicide prevention \nprogram; and  \n   High levels of fighting and assaults between youth. \n \nThese conditions are the result of, and allowed to continue to exist because generally \naccepted juvenile justice standards are not followed.  We found that staff did not receive \nminimally adequate training, and that existing policies and procedures are inadequate to ensure:  \nthat minimally necessary force is used to control youth; that chemicals are used safely; or that \nyouth are protected from sexual or physical abuse.  In addition, we found that the facility lacks \nadequate staff and that the staffing pattern places youth at risk of harm because of fatigue, \nreduced accountability, overreliance on seclusion, and inadequate supervision.  \n \nSignificantly, we found limited mechanisms  to provide accountability.  During our \ninspections we uncovered staff members who lied about performing room checks.  This \ninformation would not have been discovered but for our efforts.  In addition, we found that child \nabuse allegations are not reported to state officials as required by law; the facility fails to collect \ndata that would permit managers to identify and address problems; there is inadequate \nsupervision of line staff; and no meaningful quality assurance program exists. \n \nThe failure to meet generally accepted juvenile justice standards in the face of severe \nproblems in the facility violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s mandate that youth in state \ncustody be protected from harm.  In this letter we provide additional recommendations that are \nminimally necessary to bring the facility into compliance with the Constitution.  \n \nInvestigation \n \n  On March 22-25, 2010, we conducted on-site inspections at Terrebonne with expert \nconsultants in juvenile justice administration and protection from harm.  We interviewed Facility  \nmanagement personnel, direct care and administrative staff, and youth.  Before, during, and after \nour visits, we reviewed an extensive number of documents, including policies and procedures, \nincident reports, investigative reports, grievances from youth, staff personnel files, unit logs, \norientation materials, staff training materials, and school records.  In keeping with our pledge of \ntransparency and to provide technical assistance where appropriate, we conveyed our preliminary \nfindings to Terrebonne and Terrebonne Parish officials at the close of our on-site visits.  We  \nfollowed up with a letter to the Parish on April 22, 2010 outlining some of our most pressing \nconcerns.1 \n                                                 \n1    In our letter, we expressed serious concern that overnight rooms checks were not being \nconsistently performed, and that staff routinely appeared to be falsifying room check \ndocumentation.  In addition, we expressed concern that overnight shift staff were not being \nadequately supervised and were not being held accountable for complying with Terrebonne \npolicies and procedures. \n \n \n\n- 3 -\n \n  We commend the staff at Terrebonne for their helpful and professional conduct \nthroughout the course of the investigation.  We  received full cooperation with our investigation \nand appreciate the Parish’s receptiveness to our consultants’ on-site recommendations.  Also, we \nappreciate comments made by Ralph Mitchell, the Director of the Terrebonne Parish Department \nof Public Safety, indicating that he had become  aware of some of the problems we identified, and \nhad begun formulating remedies to address some of our most serious concerns.   \n \n  In addition, we appreciate the thorough cooperation provided by Facility Director Jason \nHutchinson. Director Hutchinson brings a number of strengths to the role of facility \nsuperintendent -- he is a bright, caring, dedicated, and committed person who has brought about \nseveral innovations in education and programming that affirm his commitment to the best \ninterest of detained youth.  He is appropriately educated, holding a bachelor’s degree in \npsychology and a master’s degree in special education.  Director Hutchinson has experience \nworking with troubled youth in the public schools and educational programming for adults in \njail.  The Director was highly receptive to our observations and has reported to us that he has \nimplemented a number of remedial measures in response to our April 22, 2010 letter.  In \nparticular, on May 20, 2010 we were advised by counsel for the Parish that the Director has \ntaken steps to ensure that overnight room checks are performed in a timely manner, and that \novernight shift staff are now subject to periodic surprise visits by external law enforcement \npersonnel. \n \nWe now write to advise you of the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting \nthem, and the minimum remedial steps that are necessary to address the deficiencies we have \nidentified. As described more fully below, we conclude that certain conditions at Terrebonne \nviolate the constitutional rights of the youth.   \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nTerrebonne is a secure juvenile detention facility opened on September 1, 1998 and \nlocated in Houma, Louisiana.  The Facility’s mission is to “provide short-term care in the \nsecured custody of juveniles who are accused, adjudicated pending court action, awaiting \ntransfer to another facility, and who cannot be served in an open setting.”2  Terrebonne also \nserved as one of three regional placement centers in Louisiana for adjudicated female youth \npursuant to a per diem contract between Terrebonne Parish and the State.  In May 2009, \nhowever, the State removed its contracted population from the Facility, and only the detention \nand pending placement populations remain. \n \n  One of the published goals of Terrebonne is to house “the juveniles in a safe and humane \nenvironment, maintaining the level of security necessary to prevent escape and assure that the \njuveniles live free of fear from assault or intimidation by staff or other juveniles.”  Terrebonne \nhas a capacity to hold 60 juveniles, including 40 males and 20 females.  On February 1, 2010, the \nFacility housed a total population of 40 youth, and during the period of review, remained below  \n \n                                                 \n2    http://www.tpcg.org/view.php?f=juvenile_detention.  \n \n \n\n- 4 - \n \noperational capacity. Between its 1998 opening and July 31, 2007 (the most recent period for \nwhich published figures are available), the Facility has processed over 7,000 youth.3  \n \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS  \n \n  Section 14141 authorizes the Department of Justice to seek a remedy for a pattern or \npractice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of youth in juvenile \njustice institutions. 42 U.S.C. § 14141. Youth detained at Terrebonne are protected by the \nFourteenth Amendment and have a substantive due process right to reasonably safe conditions of \nconfinement and freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. \n307, 316 (1982) (“If it is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe \nconditions, it must be unconstitutional to confine the involuntarily detained - who may not be \npunished at all - in unsafe conditions.”). The Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Eighth \nAmendment applies because the youth are held for detention or rehabilitation, not punishment. 4   \nThe purpose of the Louisiana youth delinquency statute is to \"accord due process to each child \nwho is accused of having committed a delinquent act... and to secure for him care as nearly as \npossible equivalent to that which the parents should have given him.\"5  \n \nTo determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment was violated, a balancing test must be \napplied:  “It is necessary to balance ‘the liberty of the individual’ and ‘the demands of an \norganized society.’” Youngberg at 320 citing Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542 (1961) (Harlan, \nJ., dissenting).  The Youngberg Court went on to hold that “If there is to be any uniformity in \nprotecting these interests, this balancing cannot be left to the unguided discretion of a judge or \njury.” Id. at 321. Instead, the Court held that there was a constitutional violation if the detaining \nofficial substantially departed from generally accepted professional standards, and that departure \nendangers youth in their care. See id. at 314. \n \n  As a general matter, the Supreme Court has held that corrections officials must take \nreasonable steps to guarantee detainees' safety and provide \"humane conditions\" of confinement.  \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994); Scott v. Moore, 85 F.3d 230, 235 (5th Cir. 1996) \n(holding that a municipality assumed a constitutional obligation to provide pre-trial detainees \nwith minimal levels of safety and security); Hare v. City of Corinth, 74 F.3d 633, 639 (5th Cir.) \n(en banc) (recognizing a duty to provide detainees with basic human needs including protection \nfrom harm).  In addition, an official's failure to maintain adequate policies, procedures, and  \n                                                 \n3    Id.  \n \n4    In Ingraham v. Wright, the Supreme Court rejected application of the Eighth Amendment \ndeliberative indifference standard in a non-criminal context.  430 U.S. 651, 669 n.37 (1977) \n(“Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after the State has complied with the \nconstitutional guarantees traditionally associated with criminal prosecutions.”).  In addition, the \nCourt held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the proper \nconstitutional gauge to determine the rights of adults detained by a state, but not yet convicted of \nany crime.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  See also, Scott v. Moore, 85 F.3d 230, 235 \n(5th Cir. 1996).  At a minimum, youth should be accorded the same constitutional protections.  \n  \n5    La. Child. Code Ann. art. 801 (2010).  \n \n\n- 5 - \n \npractices for the prevention of suicides may violate a detainee's due process rights.  Silva v. \nDonley County, 32 F.3d 566, 1994 WL 442404, *5-7 (5th Cir. 1994) (unpublished) (holding \nsheriff's failure to establish suicide detection and prevention training for jail personnel, \ncondoning de facto policy of sporadic cell checks, and absence of a policy for observing \"at-risk\" \ndetainees may rise to deliberate indifference to known risk of suicide in detention settings).  \n \n  Additionally, juvenile detainees have a constitutional right to be free from sexual assault \nand forced sexual contact by correctional staff. See, e.g., Spencer v. Doe, 139 F.3d 107, 112 (2d \nCir. 1998) (noting that juvenile detainee had the right to be protected from sexual molestation \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment); Ware v. Jackson County, 150 F.3d 873, 884-85 (8th Cir. \n1998) (sexual assault of adult inmate may violate Eighth Amendment); Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 \nF.3d 1299, 1310 (10th Cir. 1998) (forced oral sex and sexual assault of adult prisoners are \n\"sufficiently serious to constitute a violation under the Eighth Amendment\").  Sexual assaults by \nstaff, including rape, coerced sodomy, or touching of female prisoners' breasts and genitalia, are \nsimply not part of the penalty that juvenile detainees pay for their offenses against society.  See  \nFarmer v. Brennan, at 834. \n \nConfined youth have a constitutional right of freedom from unreasonable bodily \nrestraints. Youngberg v. Romeo, at 320.  The routine improper use of an isolation unit in a state \nfacility can constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F. Supp 1130 (S.D. \nMiss. 1977).  In Morgan, youth were placed on the highly restrictive unit for a variety of \ndisciplinary offenses, including some as minor as \"being disrespectful to staff members, stealing, \nand behaving inadequately...\". Id. at 1129. The average length of confinement on the unit was \n11 days. After considering extensive expert testimony in other cases, the court severely \nrestricted the conditions under which the facility could place youth in such a unit: \n \nThe defendants will therefore be enjoined from using the isolation unit as an \nisolation unit, except under the following limited conditions which are necessary \nto insure that placement therein will not do any emotional or psychological harm  \nto the students: students may not be placed in the isolation unit except where there \nis substantial evidence that they constitute an immediate threat to the physical \nwell-being of themselves or others; confinement may not exceed 24 hours and \nmust be approved within one hour of the confinement by the Superintendent, one \nof the Assistant Superintendents, the Chief Counselor or a staff psychologist; \nstudents in the isolation unit must be visited at least once every three hours during \nthe day by the Chief Counselor, the students' own counselor or a licensed \npsychologist; the cells in the isolation  unit must be provided with transparent \nwindows, lights, mattresses, blankets, sheets, pillows, small tables for reading, \nchairs, soap and towels; unless a contrary program is indicated in an individual \ncase by a licensed psychologist, students placed in the isolation unit must be \npermitted to sleep a reasonable time during the day, to have reading materials, to \nsend and receive mail, and to have visitors; the students must receive daily at least \nan hour's physical exercise outside of the isolation unit or in the gym; and they \nmust be allowed to eat their meals outside of their cells.  Id. at 1140. \n \n  Finally, conditions of confinement claims  may be based not only upon existing physical \nharm to youth, but also on conditions that threaten to cause future harm.  Helling v. McKinney, \n \n\n- 6 - \n \n509 U.S. 25 (1993) (stating \"it would be odd to deny relief to detainees who plainly proved an \nunsafe, life-threatening condition in their facility on the ground that nothing yet had happened to \nthem.\").  In Helling, the court recognized various circuit courts holding that \"a detainee need not \nwait until he is actually assaulted before obtaining relief\" and that the Constitution \"protects \nagainst sufficiently imminent dangers...\" Id., at 33-35 (internal citations omitted).  See also, \nHerman v. Holiday, 238 F.3d 660 (5th Cir. 2001) (recognizing Helling standard); Hoeing v. \nCollins, 95 F.3d 53 (5th Cir. 1996) (unpublished); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1308-10 (5th \nCir. 1974) (holding that failure to provide adequate systems to protect inmates against future \nharm including physical assaults and abuse constituted cruel and unusual punishment). \n \nIII. FINDINGS \n \n  We find that Terrebonne fails to adequately protect youth in its care from harm and \nserious threat of harm by staff, other youth and from self-harm. \nA.   The Facility fails to adequately protect youth from harm by detention staff.  \n \n  In 2009, direct care staff members (including two supervisors) were indicted or charged \nwith a total of 21 counts of custodial sexual misconduct or related crimes involving female youth \nunder their supervision. These crimes include molestation, indecent behavior, criminal \nmalfeasance, and obstruction of justice.  While the charged staff members have not yet been \nadjudicated in a criminal court,6 Parish and Facility officials have not disputed the substance of \nthe charges, and have taken some corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the conduct \nalleged.  The charged staff members have all been removed or have resigned from their posts.  A \nsummary of the most serious charges follow. \n \n  On June 24, 2009, a Louisiana grand jury returned an eight-count indictment against \nSupervisor 17, a male Terrebonne correctional supervisor in charge of the night shift, alleging \nthat Supervisor 1 engaged in unlawful lewd behavior and sexual conduct with four detained \nfemale youth, ages 15 or 16, between April 29, 2008 and April 28, 2009.   \n \n  Three weeks later, on July 13, 2009, the grand jury returned a four-count indictment \nagainst Staff 1, a male Terrebonne correctional officer, alleging that Staff 1 engaged in unlawful \nlewd behavior and sexual conduct with two detained female youth, ages 15 and 16.   \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n6    Four of the accused staff are scheduled for trial in February 2011, with the remaining \nstaff trial dates to occur sometime afterwards.  \n \n7    Because individuals who have been charged but not yet adjudicated in a criminal court \nare presumed innocent, we are not using the names of the accused staff. \n \n \n\n- 7 - \n \n  In addition to the grand jury indictments against Supervisor 1 and Staff 1, the Terrebonne \nParish District Attorney brought charges directly (bypassing the grand jury system) against four \nadditional Terrebonne staff related to custodial sexual misconduct at the Facility.8    \n \n*   *   * \n \nWhether or not each of the charged staff are ultimately adjudicated guilty in a criminal \ncourt, we examined whether there are adequate systems and structures in place at Terrebonne to \nminimize the risk of future harm to youth.  Helling, 509 U.S. at 33-35. We find, among other \nthings, that youth are not adequately protected from harm by staff.  Specifically, we find that \nstaff are not adequately supervised; that use of force policies, procedures, and practices are \ninadequate; that there are inadequate numbers of direct care staff to ensure the safety of youth; \nthat there are inadequate systems for reporting allegations of child abuse; and that the Facility \nfails to provide appropriate training on the prevention of custodial sexual misconduct.  In each of \nthese areas, we find that Terrebonne substantially departs from generally accepted professional \nstandards in juvenile detention in a manner that endangers youth, and thus violates the youths'  \nconstitutional rights to reasonably safe conditions of confinement and freedom from  \nunreasonable bodily restraint. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324.9  \n \n1.  Staff Accountability  \n \n  Since February 2009, a total of 15 incidents of staff misconduct were investigated at the \nfacility level.  The 15 incidents were all investigated and staff were held accountable for their \nfailure to follow required procedures.  Staff received letters from the Director that discussed the \nprocedures violated and why they were important to the effort to protect youth from harm and \nsuggested appropriate ways of handling the situation, should it arise again in the future. \n \n  While these examples represent efforts on the part of Facility administrators and \nsupervisors to enforce some Facility procedures and hold staff accountable for their failures to \nfollow certain Facility procedures, during the week of our visit, we became aware of several \nother instances in which staff routinely violate policy and procedure and yet were not held  \n   \n                                                 \n8    These charges alleged, among other things, that Staff 2 engaged in unlawful custodial \nsexual misconduct with a female youth, age 14-15, over a ten month period ending in March  \n2009; and that Supervisor 2 engaged in unlawful custodial sexual misconduct with a female \nyouth, age 15-16, over a six month period ending in March 2009.  Both Staff 2 and Supervisor 2 \nare male.   \n \n9    Even applying the more lenient adult corrections deliberate indifference standard, we find \nthat Parish officials disregarded known substantial risks of serious harm to youth at the Facility, \nand thus acted with deliberate indifference to those risks in violation of youths' constitutional \nrights. See Helling, 509 U.S. at 33-35. For example, at least as early as June 2009, officials \nwere aware of serious criminal allegations regarding custodial sexual misconduct at the Facility, \nbut had not taken necessary remedial steps to eliminate this known danger.  Similarly, at least as \nearly as October 2009, officials were aware of the high rate of suicidal behavior at the Facility, \nbut had not taken necessary remedial steps to ameliorate this known risk.  \n \n \n\n- 8 - \n \naccountable for their behavior. While certain supervisors may have been aware of the staffs'  \nfailures in these areas, no formal investigation or documentation regarding employee discipline \nwas provided. As discussed throughout this letter, this lack of staff accountability has led to a \nblatant disregard for the performance of job functions essential to keeping youth reasonably safe \nin a juvenile detention facility.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324. See also, Gates, 501 F.2d at 1308-\n10 (holding failure to adequately supervise inmates unconstitutional).  These situations included: \n \n \t  Failing to make 15‐minute confinement checks (violates Policy #17.2 \"Minor Violations \nand Their Resolutions,\" \"During room restriction staff contact will be made every 15 \nminutes\").  Several examples were noted during our videotape verification of Room \nConfinement Check Sheets.  \n \n \t  Failing to notify the Facility’s social worker of all youth placed on suicide precautions  \n(violates Policy #8.5 \"Mental Health Care Program,\" \"Suicide watch... shall be on a \ncontinuous basis until evaluation can be performed by a clinician\").  We discovered two \nsituations in March 2010 where two youths were placed on suicide precautions and the \nsocial worker was not notified. \n \n \t  Failing to stay on post on the 3rd shift or otherwise leaving a housing unit unsupervised \n(violates Policy #15.4 “Shift Assignments” “To ensure proper supervision... juvenile \ncaseworker positions should be located in or immediately adjacent to juvenile living  \nareas”). Several youth and staff reported to us that direct care staff members on the 3rd \nshift congregate in the common area during the youths' sleeping hours, leaving the \nhousing units unattended.  Further, an incident report from March 11, 2010 revealed that \na staff member assigned to monitor a housing unit left the dorm, and one of the youth \nattempted suicide by strangulation.  Staff members were alerted to the situation by one of \nthe other youth housed on the unit. \n \n \t  During interviews, several staff indicated a blatant disregard for policy.  One second shift \nemployee believed it was unnecessary to conduct routine room checks of youth during \nthe night.  Another staff admitted to sleeping during the night shift.  One second shift \nsupervisor indicated that when staff appear to be sleeping, the supervisor is merely \n\"telling them to walk around in order to wake them up\" without instituting any \ndisciplinary action. \n \n  Each of these situations represents staff misconduct and failure to follow policy and \nprocedure that could result in serious harm to youth (by youth, by staff, or self‐inflicted).  While \nthe Director had taken action against staff members who violated the Use of Force policy and \nother types of misconduct, the other issues appeared not to have been addressed in any \nsubstantive manner.  Each of the issues — 15‐minute confinement checks, suicide precautions, \nand youth supervision — should be part of routine oversight by the Facility’s supervisors.  This \ndoes not appear to be occurring with either the regularity or the keen eye required to ascertain \nwhether staff are following policy consistently.  \n \n \n   \n \n\n- 9 - \n \n2.  Use of Force and Isolation \n \n  The duty to protect youth from harm includes efforts to prevent youth from harming each \nother (i.e., fighting) and also efforts to ensure that, when staff must intervene physically, they do \nso using means that do not unnecessarily subject youth to pain or injury.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at \n324. Attaining either of these objectives requires a facility to have detailed policies and \nprocedures guiding the use of force that are in line with contemporary standards.   \n \n  In many cases, youth‐on‐youth violence and other out‐of‐control behavior can be \nprevented with proper behavior management techniques and sound verbal de‐escalation skills.  \nFailing this, staff has a duty to reduce the harm  that can occur by intervening with tempered, \nwell‐timed, well‐executed physical restraint. Conditions of confinement at the Facility are \nunconstitutional because youth are being harmed or are at risk of harm, Terrebonne's policies and \nprocedures substantially depart from generally accepted standards of care, and actual practices \nsuggest that staff do not regularly follow these inadequate policies.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324. \n \na.  Policy and Training \n \n  The Facility’s Policy #15.3 “Use of Force” emphasizes using non‐physical means to \ncontrol the situation and, failing that, using only the minimum amount of force necessary to gain \ncontrol. While this is a solid beginning, the policy lacks several key elements. \n \n  Terrebonne's policy does not provide specific training requirements for the use of force, \nstating only that “staff will be trained in approved methods.”  Currently there are no approved \nmethods, indicating that the policy itself is largely aspirational.  All staff reported that they had \nnever been trained on specific restraint techniques and were forced to rely on their own judgment \nor training received in other settings (e.g., military or adult correctional facilities).  Not only does \nthis make enforcing Terrebonne's policy difficult, as there are no sanctioned techniques and \ntherefore no techniques that are specifically prohibited, it also leaves staff with very few tools for \nsafely and effectively responding to youth’s aggression or out-of-control behavior.  As a result, \nyouth have been injured and the risk to both youth and staff safety is significant. \n \n  Further, knowledge about the safe use of chemical agents (oleo capsicum or \"OC\") was \nminimal among staff.  Some staff were able to recount only basic facts about the use of OC (e.g., \nto deploy the spray in very short bursts; how to hold the canister), while others could not recall \nany specific information from the OC training they received.  In addition, none of the staff \ninterviewed were well‐versed in proper OC decontamination procedures. \n \nb.  Improper and Unnecessary Use of Physical Restraint \n \n  Conditions of confinement at Terrebonne are unconstitutional because staff members use \nforce that is either unnecessary or poorly executed.  Generally accepted professional standards in \na juvenile detention facility require that only appropriate levels of force are used, and only when \na youth’s behavior poses an imminent risk of harm to himself or others, or only when necessary \nto restore essential institutional security.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324; Hudson v. McMillian, \n503 U.S. at 6-9 (1992); Gomez v. Chandler, 163 F.3d 921 (5th Cir. 1999). Examples of the \ninappropriate or unnecessary use of force at Terrebonne include the following: \n \n\n- 10 - \n \n \t  On March 5, 2010, a youth went into the bathroom on the housing unit without \npermission.  The youth complied with the staff’s directive to come  out of the bathroom, \nbut balked at the staff’s insistence that he be placed in isolation for this minor rule \nviolation. When staff responded to the call for assistance to transport the youth to the \nisolation unit, the youth then became aggressive, resulting in a physical restraint, a \nbotched mechanical restraint (staff could not remove the handcuffs), the use of OC spray, \nand two staff injuries. Given that the youth complied with the initial directive to leave \nthe bathroom and (at that point) posed no threat to other youth or staff, the entire restraint \nand ensuing injuries could have been avoided. \n \n\t   On March 4, 2010, a youth reportedly cursed at staff and then went to his bunk.  Staff \nreported that he “took him out of bed” to transport him to the isolation unit for this minor \nrule violation.  Video footage of this incident showed a single male staff person lifting a \nyouth (who was simply lying on his bed, not threatening staff or other youth) off his bed \nand struggling with him as he carried him off the housing unit.  Neither the written \nincident report nor the video footage suggested any reason why this youth’s behavior \ncould not have been handled on the unit, without physical intervention.  The restraint was \nboth unnecessary and very poorly executed. The staff member involved received a verbal \nwarning for his involvement in this incident. \n \n\t   On March 7, 2010, a youth approached another youth in the housing unit and began to \npunch him in the head and body.  Two staff members pulled the two youth apart from \nbehind. One staff member pulled one of the youth to another area of the unit, but did not \nsecure him in any way (e.g., using an escort technique or other method to control the \nyouth’s movement until he was calm).  That youth broke away, ran across the dorm and \njumped over a table, and began to assault the other youth again.  The staff members’ \nphysical intervention was so poorly executed that it provided an opportunity for another \nassault to occur. \n \nc. \t Unnecessary Use of Chemical Agents and  Restraint Chair \n \n  In determining whether a physical intervention may be unconstitutional, it is \"proper to \nevaluate the need for application of force, the relationship between that need and the amount of \nforce used, the threat 'reasonably perceived by the responsible officials,' and 'any efforts made to \ntemper the severity of a forceful response.'\"  Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6-9 (1992).  \nConditions of confinement at Terrebonne violate youths' constitutional rights because the use of \nsevere interventions at the Facility, such as chemical agents and restraint devices, are often not \nneeded, when no threatening behavior is apparent, and before reasonable efforts to temper the \nprecipitating behavior have been attempted. \n \n  Terrebonne policy permits the use of both OC spray and the restraint chair only in \nextraordinary circumstances.  After these items are deployed, generally accepted professional \nstandards dictate that nursing staff must assess the youth to determine whether any injuries or \ncomplications arise as a result of their use.  Nonetheless, we identified a number of examples \nwhere staff used these types of force on youth who were not particularly threatening, and \nsometimes even compliant, or where nursing staff were not consulted after their use, both \n   \n \n\n- 11 - \n \nviolations of youths' constitutional rights.  Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1; Youngberg, 457 \nU.S. at 324. Examples include: \n \n \t  On March 14, 2010, a female youth was booked into the Facility.  The youth indicated \nthat she did not want to take a shower but was very calm during this refusal, walking \nslowly with her arms wrapped around her torso.  Staff tried to persuade her for a couple \nminutes, and then wheeled the restraint chair over to her.  The youth became very \ndistressed as the staff forced her into the chair; crying and thrashing her head about as the \nstaff strapped her in. She remained in the restraint chair for 20 minutes.  Although the \nDirector of the Facility initially stated that this was a “good example of the use of the \nrestraint chair,” when questioned during the viewing of the videotape, he agreed that the \nyouth did not pose a threat to herself or anyone else at the time.  The videotape clearly \nshows that the restraint chair caused distress and was completely unnecessary in the \ncircumstance in which it was used. \n \n \t  On September 1, 2009, a male youth is seen on videotape hitting his head on a table one \ntime.  Staff walked over to him and engaged the youth in a short discussion.  The youth \ngot up from the table and walked to the unit door, on his own and without any threatening \ngestures or body language. As the restraint chair was brought toward him (it is unclear in \nthe documentation why staff felt the restraint chair was necessary), the youth’s behavior \nescalated and he began to resist staff’s efforts to put him in the chair.  The chair itself was \noff camera, and the restraint chair documentation indicates only that the youth was still in \nthe chair at the first 15‐minute check.  The exact time of release is not noted.  This is \nanother example of a fully compliant youth who was placed in a mechanical restraint \ndevice that caused the youth significant distress.  If used at all, the restraint chair should \nbe reserved only for out‐of‐control youth who pose an immediate danger to themselves or \nothers. \n \n \t  On January 9, 2010, an incident report describes a youth refusing to comply with a \ndirective to proceed to the isolation unit.  The youth was seated at a table at the time.  \nStaff did not attempt physical restraint nor did staff call for assistance.  Given the youth’s \nhistory of threatening staff verbally, the staff “thought the safest way for everyone would \nbe to pepper spray the youth.” The first burst of spray hit the youth on the side of the \nface and the youth “retreated,” only to be hit with a second burst of spray on the neck.  \nAfter being sprayed twice, the youth then became assaultive toward staff.  Not only was \nOC spray used as a “first” rather than a “last resort,” but it was used on a youth who was \nmerely non‐compliant and not physically threatening or aggressive toward staff.  This \nyouth did not receive medical attention following the use of OC spray as “no medical \npersonnel were present.”  Staff was given a written warning and additional training for \nthis incident, although the failure to provide prompt medical attention was not addressed. \n \n \t  On February 2, 2010, a youth who assaulted another youth and became physically \nassaultive toward staff was sprayed with OC spray.  The Chemical Agent Form indicates \n“No medical attention was needed.”  Failure to provide medical attention after such \nexposure to OC is a blatant departure from  generally accepted professional standards.  \n   \n \n\n- 12 - \n \n  These examples illustrate that Terrebonne's policy and practices around these issues are \ninadequate in terms of their ability to assure that staff use these tools only when necessary, or \nthat youth receive medical attention following their use.  Rather than protecting youth from  \nharm, staff may in fact cause harm with their uncontrolled, poor execution and lack of medical \nattention following the incident. \n  d.  Use of Excessive or Unnecessary Isolation  \n \n  Terrebonne violates youths' constitutional rights by subjecting them to harmful and \nunnecessary restraint in isolation rooms.  In addition, the amount of youth isolation at \nTerrebonne is excessive and disproportionate to the underlying disciplinary offense committed \nby the youth. Isolation in juvenile facilities should only be used when the youth poses an \nimminent danger to staff or other youth, or when less severe interventions have failed.10 Morgan  \nv. Sproat, 432 F. Supp. at 1132. Youth at Terrebonne are denied many of these basic \nprotections. \n \n  Youth at the Facility are isolated at rates significantly higher than nationally reported \nfield averages.  Specifically, the number of room confinements and the average number of hours  \nspent in isolation are approximately twice the Performance-based Standards (\"PbS\")11 national \nfield average (\"NFA\"), and the maximum time youth spend in confinement is approximately four \ntimes the PbS NFA.12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10    Examples of less severe interventions may include, among other things, a loss of certain \nprivileges, a reduction in behavior management levels, or a restriction from participating in an \noptional activity.  \n \n11    Performance-based Standards for Youth Correction and Detention Facilities is a self-\nimprovement and accountability system used in 31 states and the District of Columbia to better \nthe quality of life for youths in custody. PbS gives agencies the tools to collect data, analyze the \nresults to design improvements, implement change, and measure effectiveness with subsequent \ndata collections from within the facility and against other participating facilities.  See  \nhttp://www.pbstandards.org. \n \n12    We note that, while the PbS national field average is neither a representative nor a \nrandom sample, it is the best available database for external comparisons related to the \noccurrence of critical behaviors.  \n \n\n- 13 -\n \nTable 1. \t  Estimated TPJDC Rates of Specifi c Incidents for October 2009 as \nCompared with PbS Field Averages from the October 2009 National Data \nCollection period \n \nIncident Category  Total  PbS National \n  Number  Terrebonne Rate  Field \n      Average \nSuicidal Behavior  9  0.627  0.119 \nBattery and Fighting  6  0.418  0.350 \nPepper Spray  3  0.209  0.105 \nIsolations  76  5.299  2.84 \nAvg. Isolation Hours – Max.  3240  42.63  11.44 \nAvg. Isolation Hours – Med.  1620  21.32  11.44 \n \n \n  While isolation in certain circumstances may clearly be warranted, use of isolation at the \nFacility is sometimes unnecessary.  The following examples reflect the common practice at \nTerrebonne: \n \n \t  On February 27, 2010, a female youth received an incident report for writing \nnotes to male residents and for becoming rude and argumentative when presented \nwith the infraction. According to the Facility records, she received 35 hours of \nisolation or room confinement for behaviors that could have been handled with a \ntime out or some type of program restriction. \n  \n \t  On February 27, 2010, another youth received 31 hours of isolation for refusal to \nstop talking during sleeping hours in the boys' dorm. Again, this is an example \nwhere isolation is used although no lesser interventions had been attempted and \nno security threat was present.   \n \n  Use of isolation for mere rule enforcement is unnecessary and inappropriate.  In addition, \nthe duration of such sanctions is far in excess of acceptable practice for such minor violations, \nand violates youths' constitutional rights.   \n3.  \tStaffing \n \n  Some of the above described problems appear to have resulted from inadequate staffing.  \nFor example, this serious deficiency in staffing places youth at risk of harm because of staff \nfatigue, reduced accountability, overreliance on seclusion, and inadequate youth supervision.  \nTerrebonne claims to maintain a 1:8 staffing ratio during waking hours.13  However, we found \n   \n                                                 \n13    Generally accepted professional standards in a juvenile detention center require a direct \nsupervision ratio of a minimum of 1:8 during waking hours, and a minimum of 1:16 during \nsleeping hours. More staff-rich ratios may be required depending on the unique features and \ncharacteristics of the facility and youth. \n \n \n\n- 14 - \n \nthat, typically, the direct supervision ratios are much lower and fall far below generally accepted \nprofessional standards.  This deficiency contributes to violations of youths' constitutional rights \nto reasonably safe conditions of confinement.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324.   \n \n  Terrebonne uses an unusual staff schedule. Four discreet teams of staff exist, and each \nteam works a designated 12-hour shift on designated days, a 4-3 rotation with some built-in \novertime.  In other words, there are two different teams that cover the first shift (6:00 a.m. – 6:00 \np.m.) and two different teams that cover the second shift (6:00 p.m. – 6:00 a.m.).  Within each \nteam, there is a shift supervisor and an assistant shift supervisor in addition to a standard rotation \nof post assignments, even though there are no official post designations. Staff rotate through \nvarious unofficial posts at three-hour intervals, which results in only one staff member assigned \nto the direct and continuous supervision of a living unit for a three-hour period of time while the \nadditional staff perform other support duties in the \"general vicinity.\"  These \"general vicinity\" \nstaff do not provide direct and continuous supervision but are available on short notice to supply \nback-up and support to the single staff member assigned to direct and continuous supervision.  \nThese \"general vicinity\" staff are counted into the staffing ratio by the Facility.  This process \nrepresents a miscalculation of the ratio and a misrepresentation of the level of supervision. \n4.  Child Abuse Reporting \n \n  Generally accepted professional standards and Louisiana State Law require any caretaker \nwho knows or suspects that an incident of alleged child abuse14 has occurred must immediately \ninitiate or cause to be initiated a report to the local law enforcement or social services agency.15   \nThis is so, whether or not the responsible individual believes the allegations to be credible.  In \nother words, self-screening of abuse allegations undermines the important safeguard principles \nthe standards are designed to maintain. \n \n  Because Terrebonne's Child Abuse Reporting policy provides the Director with latitude \nin determining the veracity of allegations prior to reporting to law enforcement and child \nwelfare, youths' constitutional rights are violated. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324. The policy \nstates that the Director “shall promptly determine the facts surrounding the incident.”  In a small \nnumber of cases, this latitude has resulted in the Director’s review and investigation of incidents \nof mistreatment alleged via the grievance system, when these allegations should also have been \nreported to law enforcement and child welfare.  Failing to report allegations of abuse to an \nappropriate external agency is contrary to accepted professional standards (see PREA IN‐2) and \n                                                 \n14    Under Louisiana law, \"child abuse\" includes, among other things, \"[t]he infliction, \nattempted infliction, or, as a result of inadequate supervision, the allowance of the infliction or \nattempted infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child... which seriously endanger the \nphysical, mental, or emotional health and safety of a child...\".  La. Child. Code Ann. art. 603(1) \n(2010). \n \n15    See La. Child. Code Ann. art. 610 (2010).   In addition, proposed Prison Rape Elimination \nCommission Standards for the Prevention, Detection, Response, and Monitoring of Sexual \nAbuse in Juvenile Facilities (\"PREA\") require that \"investigations of abuse are prompt,  thorough, \nobjective and conducted by individuals who have specialized training in abuse involving young \nvictims.\"  PREA IN-2 (emphasis added).   \n \n\n- 15 - \n \nis also a violation of State law. Allegations that were not reported to law enforcement are \nsummarized below: \n \n \t  On December 28, 2009, a youth alleged that staff “slung him across the dorm... slammed \nhim into the wall... dragged him by his handcuffs and threw him into the door.”  The \nDirector conducted an administrative investigation concluding that the staff had not \nviolated Facility policies. \n \n \t  On March 8, 2010, a youth alleged that he witnessed one staff choking another youth and \nanother staff dragging a third youth to the isolation unit.  While the reporting youth \nwithdrew his compliant, the Director continued to administratively investigate the \nincident, finding the allegations to be unsubstantiated.   \n \n \t  During our interviews, a youth told us about an incident that occurred the day before in \nwhich he was reportedly “choked” by staff during a restraint.  The youth had visible \nscratches on his neck. When we brought this incident to the attention of the Director, he \nindicated that he was already aware of it and had sent the accused staff home pending the \noutcome of an administrative investigation. \n \n  The Facility Director should have reported each of these occurrences to the law \nenforcement and child welfare agencies so that they could make an independent determination \nabout whether the facts in each case warranted an investigation.  The three investigatory bodies \nserve different purposes: 1) law enforcement determines whether a criminal violation occurred; \n2) child welfare determines whether abuse or neglect occurred according to child welfare \nstandards; and 3) the Facility determines whether policies and procedures were violated.  Each of \nthese entities must be informed of all allegations of abuse to ensure that all three inquiries are \npursued.  The Facility Director should never screen out an allegation or otherwise determine that \nit should not be reported to law enforcement and child welfare, no matter the findings of the \nadministrative investigation.  This is because law enforcement and social services agencies have  \nspecialized training in investigations of this type, where many internal facility investigators do \nnot. Failure to make the reports improperly removes the oversight of external agencies from  \ntheir shared duty to protect youth from harm.  \n5. \t Training on Prevention of Sexual Misconduct \n \n  While training on certain subjects at Terrebonne is adequate, one serious omission is staff \ntraining regarding custodial sexual misconduct.  In the year since the discovery of allegations of \nserious and pervasive sexual misconduct at the Facility, Terrebonne has failed to develop a \ncurriculum and mandate that all staff receive training in the prevention of this insidious danger.  \nGiven the apparent history of problems at the Facility, this omission is a substantial departure \nfrom generally accepted professional standards and in violation of the law.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 324. \nB. \t The Facility fails to adequately protect youth from self harm.  \n \n  In addition to failing to protect youth from  harm by staff, Terrebonne fails to adequately \nprotect youth from self harm, and therefore violates youths' constitutional rights.  Youngberg, \n   \n \n\n- 16 - \n \n457 U.S. 307; Silva, 32 F.3d 566. Generally, youth in juvenile justice systems are at increased \nrisk of suicide, but available statistics for the Facility reveal that youth confined at Terrebonne \nmay be even more prone to engage in self harming behavior.  For example, in October 2009, the \nrate of suicidal behavior at the Facility was more than five times the National Field Average.  \nSee Table 1. \n \n  Shockingly, we found that room checks for youth being held in isolation were routinely \nmissed, and that staff often falsified the documentation of required room checks.  Because youth \nheld in isolation are known to be at heightened risk of suicide, this practice subjects youth at the \nFacility to serious risk of harm in violation of youths' constitutional rights.  Helling, 509 U.S. at \n25; Silva, 32 F.3d at 566.  See also, Lewis v. Parish of Terrebonne, 894 F.2d 142 (5th Cir. 1990) \n(stating \"one need not find a 'goose case' to imbue a warden at a jail with a constitutional duty to \nprotect a prisoner prone to suicide from self destruction.\").  Also, we identified significant \ndeficiencies in each of the core components of an adequate suicide prevention program.  Taken \ntogether, these deficiencies place youth at serious risk of future harm.  In each of these areas, we \nfind that Terrebonne substantially departs from  generally accepted professional standards in \njuvenile detention, and thus violate the youths' constitutional right to reasonably safe conditions \nof confinement.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324. Each of the core components and the \nFacility's deficiencies in each area are described below. \n1.  Supervision  \n \n  We reviewed the incident reports and observation forms for 17 youth placed on suicide \nprecautions between September 2009 and March 2010.  The observation forms, called  \n“Confinement Check Forms,” nearly always indicate that staff checked the safety and welfare of \nyouth at exact 15‐minute intervals.  Not only is this level of precision impossible to achieve, it is \ncounter to the best interest of the youth.  The generally accepted practice is for youth on close \nobservation to be checked at random (unpredictable) intervals, not to exceed 15 minutes.  \nFurther, we attempted to verify the data presented on the observation forms using videotaped \nfootage of the overnight shifts on the isolation unit.  In February 2010, large proportions of \nsafety and welfare checks were determined to have been fraudulently recorded (i.e., the staff \nindicated a check was conducted on the observation form, but the videotaped footage revealed \nthey did not actually do so). The following examples are illustrative of this extremely dangerous \nfailure: \n \n   A male detainee received a 48-hour confinement from February 21 through February 22, \n2010.  On the evening of February 21, the time under review ran from 2215 hours \nthrough 0530 hours or 7 hours and 15 minutes.  This equates to 30 room checks.  The log \ncontains 30 entries by the staff, including the staff member’s initials and the numerical \nbehavior identifier, indicating that 30 room checks were made.  However, the video \nshows only 11 room checks were actually performed.  \n  \n   On the following evening the same detainee was confined from 2200 hours through 05:30 \nhours or 7.5 hours. This equates to 31 room checks.  The log shows 26 entries by the \nstaff members, including the staff member’s initials and the numerical behavior \nidentifier, thereby acknowledging that five room checks were missed.  But the video \nshows only 19 room checks.  Additionally, the 48-hour confinement extended over a \n \n\n- 17 -\n \nMonday and Tuesday, but there is no documentation that the detainee received any \nschooling or recreation. \n \n \t  A detainee received a 32-hour room confinement beginning on February 27, 2010.  For \nthe evening of February 27, the time under review was from 2200 hours to 0530 hours or \n7.5 hours.  This equates to 31 room checks.  Thirty-one room checks were entered on the \nform, including the staff member’s initials and the numerical behavior identifier; but the \nvideo shows that only eight were made.   \n \n \t  On the following evening the same detainee was under review from 2200 hours through \n0545 hours or 7 hours and 45 minutes.  This equates to 32 room checks. Thirty-two room  \nchecks appear on the log, including the staff member’s initials and the numerical \nbehavior identifier; but the video shows again that only eight room checks were made. \n \n\t   A female detainee received a 35-hour room confinement beginning on February 27, 2010.  \nOn the evening of February 27, the time under review ran from 2200 hours through 0600 \nhours this equates to 33 room checks.  Thirty-three room checks are indicated on the log, \nincluding the staff member’s initials and the numerical behavior identifier; but the video \nshows that only four room checks were made. \n \n  This pattern of overnight supervision creates a severe risk of harm to youth in the facility.  \nThe dangerousness of this situation cannot be overemphasized.  Anytime a youth is locked in a \nroom alone, the risk of self‐harm increases.  The combination of a youth assessed at higher risk \nof self‐harm, isolation, and staff negligence in performing safety checks is a serious risk to youth \nsafety.16  \n \n  Additionally, Terrebonne has a single level of suicide precautions — \"close observation\" \nwhere youth are to be monitored at 15 minute intervals.  Youth who are actively suicidal, either \nthreatening or engaging in suicidal behavior, are routinely transported to the local emergency \nroom for an evaluation and possible admission to a psychiatric hospital.  Both documentation \nand reports from staff indicated that these high‐risk youth are indeed transferred to the hospital \nfor evaluation.  However, generally accepted professional standards require that, pending \ntransfer, these youth should be placed under constant observation by a dedicated staff member \nwith no other responsibilities at the time (i.e., one-on-one supervision).  This does not occur at \nTerrebonne, in violation of youths' constitutional rights to reasonably safe conditions.  \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 324. Instead, youth awaiting transfer are only monitored at the \n15‐minute intervals prescribed for youth at much lower‐risk of self‐harm.  This is an extremely \ndangerous practice given the youth’s demonstrated active suicidal behavior. \n                                                 \n16    As indicated previously, Parish Counsel forwarded us a list of measures the Facility has \npurportedly taken to ensure that, among other things, room checks are being performed as \nrequired by policy. A number of these reported measures should assist the Facility in monitoring \nstaff in performing these duties, including plans to purchase an electronic tour guard system, and \nthe periodic verification of overnight room checks with Facility digital video reviews.  While \nthese proactive measures are commendable, we are not in a position to confirm the adequacy of \nimplementation of this corrective action.   \n \n\n- 18 - \n \n2.  Training \n \n  Adequate suicide prevention training standards require initial training for new staff that \nincludes the instruction in environmental risk factors for suicide, individually predisposing \nfactors, high‐risk periods for incarcerated youth, warning signs and symptoms, the facility’s \nsuicide prevention procedures, liability issues, and a discussion of recent suicide attempts at the \nfacility. In addition, the program should include a two‐hour annual refresher training with a \nreview of risk factors, warning signs and symptoms, and policy changes.  All staff should also be \ntrained in the use of emergency equipment (e.g., the rescue tool). \n \n  In late 2009, the Facility developed a training curriculum for suicide prevention.  The \ncurriculum content appears adequate.  However, rather than the prescribed eight-hour training, \nthe training session was only five hours of actual instruction time.  Of the 52 direct care staff at \nthe Facility, documentation indicated that 83% participated in the training.  Several staff reported \nthat training in this area was not considered to be mandatory and that staff who did not attend \nwere not held accountable. Make‐up sessions for those staff who did not attend had not been \nscheduled, nor had provisions been made for teachers and other non‐direct care staff to attend the \ntraining.  While most of the staff believed the Facility owned a rescue tool, none of the staff \nknew where it was or had been trained in how to use it.  These inadequacies in the training for \ndirect care and other Facility staff (e.g., teachers) is particularly concerning because most of a \nyouth’s self‐harm behavior will happen in their presence, rather than in the presence of mental \nhealth staff who may have greater expertise in this area.  \n3.  Intake Screening \n \n  Terrebonne's intake screening questionnaire asks only if the youth currently feels like \nhurting himself or herself.  This single question is inadequate to the task of identifying youth at \nelevated risk of self‐harm and is not aligned with contemporary standards.  The screening should \nalso include questions about past suicidal behavior, prior mental health treatment, recent \nsignificant losses, family/friend’s history of suicide, and whether the youth demonstrated any \nrisk of suicide during his or her previous stays at the Facility.  Further, at Terrebonne, intake staff \nsometimes waits for the Facility’s social worker  to become available so that she can perform the \nscreening, which is contrary to the standard endorsing immediate screening upon admission.  \nFinally, the intake screening should be conducted by an individual who is trained to ask these \nquestions competently.  We learned that the Facility had just recently begun training intake staff \non appropriate youth screening. \n \n    4.  Communication  \n \n  The strength of a facility’s suicide prevention program rests on the quality of  \ncommunication between direct care staff and mental health staff (who must be engaged in \ntreatment to mitigate the youth’s risk of self‐harm). Communication between the direct care staff \nand mental health staff at Terrebonne is fragmented, at best.  While a list of youth on suicide \nprecautions is created each day, it is not broadly distributed and some of the direct care staff \ninterviewed indicated that they were often unaware of which youth were on precautions.  \nFurther, we learned that twice during March 2010, youth were placed on suicide precautions by \ndirect care staff and the social worker was not notified.  We were informed that the direct care  \n   \n \n\n- 19 - \n \nstaffs' experience with the previous social worker, who was unresponsive to most staff requests, \nled them to rely on the direct care supervisors for most decisions regarding mental health.  \nReportedly, this has been a difficult cycle to interrupt.  Finally, there is no mechanism for the \nmental health staff to communicate with direct care staff regarding the source of potentially \nsuicidal youth’s stress, the specific risks posed, or coping mechanisms or activities that may help \nto mitigate the youth’s risk of harm.  Given that youth spend most of their time with direct care \nstaff at the Facility, effective communication is vital if there is to be a coherent strategy for \nsupporting youth during a time of crisis.  Overall, the mechanisms for communication between \ndirect care and mental health care staff at the Facility do not conform to contemporary standards \nof care.  \n5.  Assessment \n \n  A youth’s risk of self‐harm is not static — it will increase and decrease depending on a \nrange of influences (e.g., contact with family, outcomes in court, environmental stressors, \ntreatment by mental health care staff, interaction with peers and direct care staff, etc.).  \nAccordingly, the youth’s need for precautions needs to be assessed frequently so that the level of \nsupervision can be adjusted as necessary.  Rather than using a structured assessment process on a \ndaily basis, the social worker did not have a set schedule for follow‐up with youth on suicide \nprecautions.  This was confirmed in our review of the mental health care files of five youth who \nhad been on suicide precautions in early 2010.  While detailed progress notes were kept on all \ncontacts with youth, these contacts were not at the frequency (i.e., daily) prescribed by \ncontemporary standards. \n \n  In large part, the lack of a clear and consistent procedure for on‐going assessment of \nsuicide risk can be attributed to the fragmentation of the mental health service delivery system at \nthe Facility. The Facility's lead social worker, another part‐time social worker, a counselor, and \na variety of community‐based counselors all provide mental health care services to Terrebonne \nyouth.  While the number of available counselors is encouraging, the fact that they do not \ncommunicate regularly, share information on clients, or have access to each other’s progress \nnotes means that the service delivery system is disjointed and a strong potential exists for a \nyouth’s mental health needs to fall through the cracks. \n6.  Housing  \n \n  In early January 2010, the Facility began to maintain youth on suicide precautions in the \ngeneral population, reassigning their bunks to ensure the best camera angle possible.  But, youth \non suicide precautions at the Facility are sometimes placed in isolation on the Delta dorm, in the \nindividual cells on the housing units, or in the cells adjacent to the medical unit.  While these \nassignments may be convenient for the staff who are responsible for supervising the youth, \nisolating youth at risk of self‐harm can increase their sense of alienation and detachment from  \nprogramming, and thus may actually increase their risk of self‐harm rather than reduce it.  When \nlegitimate security concerns permit, facilities should house youth on suicide precautions in the \ngeneral population, where their access to programming is more certain and they are able to \nmaximize their interactions with staff and peers, which is likely to reduce the risk of self‐harm.  \nSeveral staff explained that the decision to house youth at risk of self‐harm in the isolation unit \nwas because of the availability of video surveillance.  While video surveillance can be a good  \n   \n \n\n- 20 - \n \nsupplement to staff supervision (but should never replace it), the extent to which staff actually \nmonitor the video feed is questionable whether the youth is in the dorm or an isolation cell.  \nSeveral of the isolation rooms are literally covered in graffiti made with writing implements or \netched into the paint with sharp objects. In addition to the obvious concern about youth’s access \nto sharp objects, the time required to complete the graffiti suggests that staff may not be \nmonitoring the youth’s behavior in the isolation rooms with any regularity. \n \n  More regularly housing youth on suicide precautions in the general population will be \ndifficult to execute properly given the Facility’s current staffing pattern.  A single staff person is \noften responsible for supervising up to 20 youth on a housing unit.  Without an improved ratio of \nstaff to youth, maintaining youth at risk of self‐harm on the housing units is impractical, if not \ndangerous. \n7.  Lethality Reviews \n \n  Following a serious suicide attempt17 or a completed suicide, generally accepted \nprofessional standards require facilities to convene a multidisciplinary team to review the \ncircumstances surrounding the incident to identify the conditions that gave rise to it.  The \ndiscussion should include a review of the circumstances, facility procedures relevant to the \nincident, training issues, mental health services received by the youth, and recommendations for \nchanges to Facility policy and procedure that could reduce the likelihood of a similar incident in \nthe future. It is particularly concerning that, at Terrebonne, no such review process exists. \n \n*    *    * \n \n  Overall, Terrebonne's suicide prevention practices are far outside of contemporary \nstandards for adequately protecting youth from self‐harm.  The fragmentation between and \namong direct care and mental health care staff, the failure to maintain close supervision of youth \nwith demonstrated risks of self harm, the failure to conduct required room checks for youth at \nheightened risk of self harm (i.e., isolated youth), and the lack of any process to review the \ncircumstances surrounding incidents of self‐harm, despite their recent uptick, creates a very \ndangerous situation for the Facility, its staff, and the youth in its care, in violation of youths'  \nconstitutional rights. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 307; Silva, 32 F.3d at 566. \nC.  The Facility fails to provide an appropriate housing classification system.  \n \n  There are significant occurrences of youth violence at Terrebonne.  For example, the \nmost recent comparative statistics indicate that youth-on-youth assaults are approximately 20% \nhigher than the National Field Average. See Table 1. Terrebonne lacks certain fundamental \nsafeguards to adequately protect youth from  harm by other youth.  This violates youths'  \nconstitution rights to reasonably safe conditions of confinement.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. 307.  See  \nalso, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at 825. Specifically, one key strategy for protecting youth \nfrom harm is to identify those at highest risk of causing harm  to other youth and supervising  \n   \n                                                 \n17    We identified two incidents in February 2010 where youth engaged in serious suicide \nattempts and/or were considered to be at such heightened risk of suicide that protective \nhospitalization was required.  \n \n\n- 21 - \n \nthem intensively to mitigate this risk.  Accurately identifying high‐risk youth requires an \nobjective process that is consistently implemented at admission.  Once identified, high‐risk youth \nmust be supervised more closely and supported with other behavior management techniques to \neither limit their access to potential victims or to help them to develop the skills they need to \ncontrol their aggression. Adequate standards of care require a structured classification process to \nguide housing and programming decisions.  Terrebonne's lack of an adequate housing \nclassification system substantially departs from generally accepted professional standards in \njuvenile detention, and thus violates the youths' constitutional right to reasonably safe conditions \nof confinement.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. 307 \n \n  Terrebonne's policy requires each youth to be “classified according to age, sex, \ndelinquent orientation, level of risk and program  needs” and that youth with special needs must \nreceive “special consideration.”  However, the policy provides no procedures, tools or \ninstruments toward this end.  Once the youth is classified, the policy offers no guidance as to \nwhat a classification to a certain category would mean in terms of the youths’ housing or \nsupervision. Again, this policy appears to be aspirational but has no bearing on the actual \npractices at the Facility. The Facility Director and various supervisors indicated that they  \ncurrently make efforts to place more aggressive male youth in a housing unit separate from less \naggressive males, but these determinations were entirely subjective and based on either \nrecollections from a youths’ previous admissions or his behavior during the current \nincarceration.  Bed assignments are made at the discretion of unit supervisors.  Aside from  \ngrouping more aggressive youth together, no additional staffing or programming enhancements \nwere in place to address the heightened risk.   \n \n  While both the policy and the current effort to segregate more violent youth from less \nviolent youth indicate the Facility is aware of the need for strategic housing decisions, the \nprocedures for classifying youth are well outside contemporary standards of care.  As noted \nabove, the Facility’s policy implies a structured classification process, but it is entirely \nsubjective, unsupported by procedures and tools to assess youths’ risk, silent on the process for \nmaking subsequent unit and bed assignments, and lacks enhancements to supervision and \nprogramming to mitigate the risks posed by highly aggressive youth.  As a result, the \nclassification process at the Facility is ineffective to the task of protecting youth from harm. \nD.  The Facility fails to adequately report incidents and collect key data. \n \nThe purpose of a facility incident reporting process is to have a full and complete record  \nof what occurs in the facility so that administrators can identify the various conditions that create \nthe opportunity for incidents to occur, can monitor staff responses, can identify training needs, \nand can develop prevention strategies that could make each type of incident less likely to occur \nin the future.  The overall process for incident reporting at Terrebonne is far below generally \naccepted practices creating risks of undetected or unidentified harm, in violation of youths'  \nconstitutional rights.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 307; Helling, 509 U.S. at 25. An adequate \nincident reporting and data collection system  should be implemented at Terrebonne to ensure \nthat remedial measures are appropriately implemented and sustainable. \n \n  Terrebonne does not have a stand‐alone incident reporting policy; rather, procedures for \nreporting incidents are embedded within a much broader policy.  While the section of the policy  \n   \n \n\n- 22 - \n \npertaining to incident reporting includes a comprehensive list of the types of incidents that must \nbe reported, it provides no guidance on the required content of the reports or any procedures for \nadministrative review. \n \n  If incident reports are to be useful in the effort of preventing institutional misconduct and \nprotecting youth from harm, they must also provide a complete account of the event.  Only when \nthese details are known can the underlying causes of youths’ misbehavior be addressed.  Further, \nimproving the quality of staff responses to misconduct requires an understanding of the precise \nway in which staff handled the incident. We reviewed approximately 150 incident reports \ngenerated at the Facility in early 2010.  Key omissions across these reports include:  1) the \nnumber of youth and staff present at the time of the incident, and the location of individuals \npresent; 2) activity that occurred just prior to the incident; 3) a thorough description of the \nincident; 4) specificity as to how staff responded and intervened; and 5) witness statements from  \nall staff and youth present. \n \n  Perhaps as a result of these inadequacies in the content of the incident reports, aggregate \ndata on the types of incidents occurring at the Facility are difficult to reconcile with the incident \nreports themselves.  Incidents may be variously marked as “horseplay,” “pushing,” “battery,” or \n“fighting” but the distinctions in the written narratives are unclear.  Terrebonne's leadership \ndiscussed the difficulty experienced in responding to our document request because many of the \nincident reports were either mislabeled or did not clearly specify the type of incident that \noccurred. \nE.  The Facility fails to provide adequate quality assurance systems.  \n \n  Terrebonne does not currently have any structured process for quality assurance.  In fact, \nFacility leadership indicated that the assimilation of documents in preparation for our visit \nmarked the first time that Facility staff had begun to look at the patterns that exist across the \nvarious documents needed to illustrate the Facility’s practices.  While individual incidents and \nsituations are reviewed by the Facility’s management team on a daily basis, the historical lack of \noversight of the program, its various components and how they intersect and, at times, interfere \nwith each other have contributed to an environment that does not adequately protect youth from  \nharm from other youth, staff, or themselves.  An adequate quality assurance program should be \nimplemented at Terrebonne to ensure that remedial measures are appropriately implemented and \nsustainable.   \n \n*    *    * \n \n  The Parish should expeditiously implement the following remedial measures to correct \nthe constitutional deprivations outlined above.  The remedial measures below are consistent with \ngenerally accepted juvenile corrections standards. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n\n- 23 - \n \nIV.  \tREMEDIAL MEASURES  \n \nA. \t  Protection from Harm by Staff \n \n1. \t Adopt a zero-tolerance policy for abuse of youths by staff and other \nyouths, including sexual abuse. \n \n2. \t Review all incident reports at least three times per week to determine \nwhether staff may be violating policies, procedures, and rules, and \ndocument the review. \n \n3. \t Review all youth grievances at least three times per week to determine \nwhether staff may be violating policies, procedures, and rules, and \ndocument the review. \n \n4. \t Conduct routine and unpredictable audits of video recordings and surprise \nin-person visits to the Facility during the overnight shift and on weekends \nto determine whether staff may be violating policies, procedures and rules.   \n \n5. \t Promptly investigate any incident where staff are suspected of possible \nviolations of policies, procedures, or rules. \n \n6. \t Impose and document appropriate counseling, reprimands, training, or \nsanctions on staff found to have violated policies, procedures, or rules. \n \n7. \t Develop and implement an age-appropriate use of force curriculum  \n(including, among other things, de-escalation techniques and an \nappropriate continuum of interventions short of physical force). \n \n8. \t Provide a minimum of eight hours of competency-based training for all \nstaff on the approved use of force curriculum (including use of physical \nforce, physical restraints, mechanical restraints, any fixed-restraints, and \nany chemical agents), provide new employee training, and provide two \nhours of annual refresher training. \n \n9. \t Prohibit the use of fixed-restraints and chemical agents, except in \nextraordinary circumstances (e.g., when less severe interventions are \nunsuccessful or unavailable). \n \n10. \t Adopt an adequate continuum of disciplinary sanctions, restricting the use \nof isolation to situations where a youth poses an imminent threat to \nthemselves or others, or when less severe disciplinary measures have \nproven ineffective. \n \n11. \t Prohibit the use of disciplinary isolation longer than 72 hours, except in \nextraordinary circumstances and with the express authorization of the \nFacility Director.  Thorough documented justification shall be maintained \nfor any use of isolation longer than 72 hours. \n \n\n- 24 - \n \n \n12. \t Ensure that direct care staffing ratios are maintained at a minimum of 1:8 \nduring waking hours and 1:16 during sleeping hours, and that staff are in \nthe same room as the youth, awake, and alert.  \n \n13. \t Ensure that all youth allegations or staff reports of child abuse are referred \nto the appropriate external agency immediately, and no later than the end \nof the employee's shift. \n \n14. \t Provide a minimum of two hours of competency-based training for all \nstaff on the identification and prevention of custodial sexual misconduct or \nother sexual misconduct, and provide new employee and annual refresher \ntraining. \n \n  B. \t Protection for Self-Harm \n \n1. \t Provide a minimum of eight hours of competency-based suicide \nprevention training for all staff which includes:  the environmental risk \nfactors; individually predisposing factors; high‐risk periods; warning signs \nand symptoms, the Facility’s suicide prevention procedures; liability \nissues; a discussion of recent suicide attempts at the Facility; the use of a \nrescue tool. This should be part of new employee training, and there shall \nbe four hours of annual refresher training.  Staff shall be certified in CPR \nand first aid. \n \n2. \t Revise the intake screening questionnaire to include, among other things, \nwhether the youth feels like hurting himself or herself, any past suicidal \nbehavior (in a facility or otherwise), any prior mental health care \ntreatment, any recent significant losses, family or friends' history of \nsuicide.  \n \n3. \t Require direct care staff to immediately notify mental health care staff any \ntime a youth is placed on suicide precautions. \n \n4. \t Notify all direct care staff on a daily basis of all youth on suicide watch \nprecautions.  \n \n5. \t Provide a mechanism where mental health care staff provide critical \ninformation about youth on suicide precautions to direct care staff \nregarding known sources of stress to potentially suicidal youth, the \nspecific risks posed, or coping mechanisms or activities that may help to \nmitigate the risk of harm. \n \n   \n \n\n- 25 - \n \n6. \t Ensure that youth on suicide precautions are re-assessed at least three \ntimes per week by the mental health care staff to determine whether the \nlevel of supervision should be raised or lowered. \n \n7. \t Ensure that all mental health care staff within the Facility have access to \ncritical information for youth on suicide precaution (e.g., progress notes \nfrom all treating clinicians).  \n \n8. \t Prohibit the routine use of isolation rooms for youth on suicide \nprecautions.  Ensure that isolation rooms are only used when legitimate \nsecurity concerns exist and are documented. \n \n9. \t Ensure that youth who have been identified with a high risk of suicide \n(e.g., selected for transfer to a hospital) receive one-on-one supervision by \na direct care staff with no other duties until the youth is transferred out of  \nthe Facility.  \n \n10. \t Ensure that the safety and welfare of all youth in isolation is verified by \nstaff at unpredictable intervals not to exceed 15 minutes, and that each \ncheck is accurately documented. \n \n11. \t Ensure that all serious suicide attempts are reviewed by a multidisciplinary \nteam to review all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the \nincident, and implement any appropriate remedial action. \n \nC.  Ho\t using Classification \n \n1. \t Adopt and implement an adequate objective housing classification \ninstrument and system that determines a youths’ risk of engaging in \nserious institutional misconduct (e.g., assaultive behavior).  The scored \nfactors should include, among other things, a youth's prior institutional \nmisconduct.  Administrative overrides of risk classification should not \nexceed 20%.  \n \n2. \t Ensure that youth are classified to an appropriate housing unit and bed \nwithin 24 hours of intake, and that high-risk youth are housed separately \nfrom low-risk youth. \n \n3. \t Ensure that youth who commit serious institutional misconduct after their \ninitial classification are reassessed within 72 hours.  \n \n  D. \t Incident Reporting and Data Collection \n \nEnsure that incident reports contain all material information including, at a \nminimum, a) the number of youth and staff present at the time of the incident, and \nthe location of individuals present; b) activity that occurred just prior to the \nincident; c) a thorough description of the incident; d) specificity as to how staff \n \n\n- 26 -\n \nresponded and intervened; and e) witness statements from all staff and youth \npresent.  \n \n  E.  \tQuality Assurance \n \nDevelop and implement an effective quality assurance program to ensure that \npolicies, procedures, and practices at the Facility are being followed, and whether \npolicies require improvement or updating.  The program should:  a) create \nstandards that reflect current facility policies; b) establish a process for auditing \nfacility practices that includes document review, interviews with youth and staff, \nand observation of operational procedures and programs; c) draft a written report \non the level of compliance with each quality assurance standard; and d) create \ncorrective action plans to address the deficits noted by the quality assurance \naudits.  \n \n*     *     * \n \n  Please note that this letter is a public document.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345. \n3.  The United States is authorized to initiate this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141. \n4.

Plaintiff is the United States of America. \n6.  Defendant, Terrebonne Parish (\"Parish\") owns and operates TPJDC.  Accordingly, the \nParish is responsible for the conditions and operation ofTPJDC. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n7.  The Parish is legally responsible for the operation of TP JDC and for the health and safety of \nthe youths confined at TPJDC. \n8.  The Parish is a governmental authority with responsibility for the administration of juvenile \njustice or incarceration of juveniles within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 14141. \n9.  The Parish is obligated to operate TPJDC in a manner that does not infringe upon the federal \nrights, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nand by other federal law, of individuals confined at TPJDC. \n10. At all relevant times, the Parish has acted or failed to act, as alleged herein, under color of \nstate law. \n11. The Parish has engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to ensure that youth at TPJ DC are \nadequately protected from harm and from undue risk of harm as outlined in further detail \nbelow. \n12. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by staff by failing to adequately \nsupervise staff and failing to hold staff accountable for misconduct related to confinement \nchecks, suicide precautions and youth supervision.  For example, TPJDC staff have left \nhousing units and youth unsupervised and, in one instance, an unsupervised youth attempted \nsuicide by strangulation. \n2 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02484-HGB-JCW   Document 3   Filed 10/05/11   Page 3 of 6\n13. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by staff by failing to provide adequate \nratios of direct care staff to youth to ensure the safety ofthe youth at TPJDC.  For example, \nTPJ DC erroneously count \"general vicinity\" staff in the direct and continuous supervision \nstaff ratios. \n14. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by failing to implement adequate \nsystems for reporting allegations of child abuse.  For example, TPJDC regularly conducts \nadministrative investigations of allegations of physical abuse without reporting such \nallegations to an independent law enforcement or child welfare agency. \n15. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by failing to provide appropriate training \non the prevention of custodial sexual misconduct.  For example, TPJDC has failed to \ndevelop and train staff on the prevention, detection, and reporting of sexual misconduct by \nstaff. \n16. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by staffby failing to provide and \nimplement adequate use offorce policies and procedures.  Accordingly, TPJDC staff have \nused unnecessary or poorly executed force.  For example, youth have been unnecessarily \nsubjected to physical, mechanical, isolation room, and chemical restraints when proper \nbehavior management techniques and sound verbal de-escalation skills would have been \nappropriate and more effective. \n17. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by failing to adequately protect youth from \nself-harm.  Specifically, TPJDC was deficient in the following areas regarding suicide \nprevention:  supervision of youth on suicide precautions; training of staff; intake screening; \ncommunication; assessment; and housing. \n3 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02484-HGB-JCW   Document 3   Filed 10/05/11   Page 4 of 6\n18. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by other youth by failing to develop and \nimplement an adequate objective housing classification system and procedure.  For example, \nTPJDC's classification system was based on subjective procedures, unsupported by \nprocedures and tools to assess youths' risk, silent on the process for making subsequent unit \nand bed assigmnents, and lacked enhancements to supervision and programming to mitigate \nthe risks posed by highly aggressive youth. \n19. The Parish has failed to protect its youth from harm by failing to adequately report incidents \nand collect key data.  A full, complete, and accurate record of incidents at TPJ DC will assist \nadministrators to identify and adjust various conditions that create the opportunity for \nincidents to occur, to monitor staff responses, to identity training needs, and develop \nprevention strategies that could prevent or reduce the amount of incidents from occurring. \nMoreover, TPJDC has failed to implement an adequate quality assurance program to ensure \nthat remedial measures are appropriately implemented and sustainable. \nVIOLATIONS OF 42 U.S.C. § 14141 \n20. The allegations of Paragraphs I through 19 are hereby re-alleged and incorporated by \nreference. \n21. The acts and omissions alleged in Paragraphs 12 through 19 constitute a pattern or practice of \nconduct that violates the federal rights, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States and by other federal law, of youths confined at TPJDC. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n22. The Attorney General is authorized, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141, to seek equitable and \ndeclaratory relief. \n4 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02484-HGB-JCW   Document 3   Filed 10/05/11   Page 5 of 6\nWHEREFORE, the United States of America prays that the Court: \n23. Declare that the acts, omissions, and practices of the Defendant Parish set forth in Paragraphs \n12 through 19 above constitute a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives TPJDC's youths \nof rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the \nUnited States, and that those acts, omissions, and practices violate the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States; \n24. Permanently enjoining Defendant, its officers, agents, employees, subordinates, successors in \noffice, and all those acting in concert or participation with them from continuing the acts, \nomissions, and practices set forth in Paragraphs 12 through 19 above, and requiring Defendant \nto take such actions as will ensure that lawful conditions of confinement are afforded to youths \nat TPJDC; and \n25.

INTRODUCTION     \n \n1.   On November 19, 2009, the United States, through the Department of \nJustice, (“the United States”) notified the Parish of Terrebonne, Louisiana \n(“Parish”) of its intention to investigate the conditions of confinement at the \nTerrebonne Parish Juvenile Detention Center Facility (“Facility”), pursuant to the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 \n(“Section 14141”). \n \n2.   On March 22-25, 2010, the United States conducted an on-site inspection of \nthe Facility with experts in juvenile protection from harm and secure detention.  \nThe United States has reviewed relevant Facility policies and procedures, reports, \nlogs, video recordings, and other relevant documents and data, and interviewed \nFacility staff and detainees. \n \n3.   On January 18, 2011, the United States issued an investigative findings \nletter which concluded that certain conditions at the Facility violated the \nconstitutional rights of juveniles detained or committed to the Facility (“Findings \nLetter”).   The Findings Letter is Attached.    \n \n4.   This Revised Settlement Agreement and Order (“Agreement”) is entered into \nbetween the United States and the Parish (collectively, “Parties”) to address \nconditions of confinement at the Facility.  Consistent with the Court’s October 18, \n2011, Order, this Agreement is filed in the United States District Court, Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana (Dkt. No. 5), and along with the Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. \n3), which supersedes the initial Complaint (Dkt. No.1) in toto, shall resolve the \nUnited States’ claims, to date, that the Parish is in violation of Section 14141 in its \noperation and management of the Facility. \n \n5.   The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331,     \n28 U.S.C. § 1345, and 42 U.S.C.  § 14141.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n \n6.  The Parties stipulate that this Agreement complies in all respects with the \nprovisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a) (“PLRA”). \n \n7.  The Parties stipulate and agree that all of the prospective relief in this \nAgreement is narrowly drawn and extends no further than is necessary to correct \nthe violations of the federal rights as described in the attached Findings Letter and \nincorporated into this Agreement.   The Parties further stipulate and agree that the \nprovisions of this Agreement are the least intrusive means necessary to correct the \nviolations of the federal rights. \n \n8.  This Agreement shall constitute the entire integrated agreement of the \nParties.  Except for the United States’ January 18, 2011, Findings Letter, no prior \ncontemporaneous communications, oral or written, or prior drafts shall be relevant \n \n\n \nor admissible for purposes of determining the meaning of any provisions herein in \nthis litigation or in any other proceeding.   \n \n9.

For purposes of substantial compliance with this Agreement, the Parish shall \nfully implement all of the provisions of this Agreement within twelve (12) months of \nthe Effective Date.  For purposes of substantial compliance with the specific \nprovisions of the Agreement, the Parish shall comply with Paragraph 78 of this \nAgreement and the requirements set forth within each provision accordingly.  If the \nParish cannot fully implement the reforms required by this Agreement or a specific \nprovision within the allotted time, the Parish shall notify the United States in \nwriting. \n \n72.  Within two (2) weeks of the Effective Date, the Parish shall communicate the \nprovisions set forth in this Agreement to officials, employees, agents, and \nindependent contractors who are involved in providing care to the youth confined at \nthe Facility. \n \n73.  The Parish shall require that youth admitted prior to the Effective Date and \nresiding at any of the Facility are afforded all of the same protections and services \nprovided by this Agreement to youth admitted on or subsequent to the Effective \nDate. \n \n \n\n \n74.  Monitor Selection.  Compliance with this Agreement shall be assessed by a \nMonitor jointly selected by the Parties (“Monitor”).  The Monitor shall be an expert \nin the area of juvenile protection from harm.  The Parties shall agree upon a \nMonitor within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date.  If the Parties are unable to \nagree upon a Monitor, then each Party shall submit two names, along with resumes\nor curricula vitae and cost proposals, to the Court, within 120 days of the Effective \nDate and the Court shall appoint the Monitor from among the names submitted.  \n \n75. \t\t\t\t Monitor.  \n \na) \t\t\t\t The Parish shall bear all reasonable fees and costs of the Monitor.   \n \nb) \t\t\t\t The Monitor shall be permitted to initiate and receive ex parte \ncommunications with all Parties. \n \nc) \t\t\t\t Except as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the \nParties acting together, the Monitor shall not make any oral or written \npublic statements – including statements to the press, conference \npresentations, lectures, or articles – with regard to:  the status of the \nParish’s compliance or noncompliance with this Agreement; any act or \nomission of the Parish or its agents, representatives or employees; or \nthe terms of his or her employment as the Monitor.  \n \nd) \t\t\t\t Except as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the \nParties acting together, the Monitor shall not testify in any other \nlitigation or proceeding with regard to the status of the Parish’s\ncompliance or noncompliance with this Agreement; any act or omission \nof the Parish or its agents, representatives or employees; or the terms \nof his or her employment as the Monitor, unless otherwise lawfully \ncompelled to do so.  The Monitor may testify in this litigation \nconcerning the Parish’s compliance or noncompliance with this \nAgreement. \n \ne) \t\t\t\t Unless such conflict is waived by  both Parties, the Monitor shall not \naccept employment or provide consulting services that would present a \nconflict of interest with his or her responsibilities under this \nAgreement, including being retained (on a paid or unpaid basis) by any \ncurrent or future litigant or claimant or such litigant’s or claimant’s \nattorney, in connection with a claim or suit against the Parish or its \ndepartments, officers, agents or employees concerning matters relevant \nto this Agreement. \n \n \n\n \nf) \t\t\t\t Neither Party, nor any employee or agent of either Party, shall have \nany supervisory authority over the Monitor’s activities, reports, \nfindings, or recommendations. \n \ng) \t\t\t\t The Monitor may be terminated if both Parties agree and upon good \ncause shown.  Good cause shall include any violation of Parish or \nfederal law which reasonably calls into question the Monitor’s fitness \nto continue serving as the Monitor.  In the event the Parties do not \nagree upon the need for termination, the Parties agree to work in good \nfaith to resolve their differences.   \n \n76.   Monitor’s Access to  Facility and Records.  In order to assess the Parish’s \nimplementation of each substantive provision of this Agreement, the Monitor will \nconduct regular compliance reviews to ensure that the Parish has implemented and \ncontinues to implement all measures required by this Agreement.  Such access shall  \ncontinue until this Agreement is terminated. \n     \n  a) \t\t\t\t The first compliance review will be conducted within ninety (90) days  \n    of the Monitor Selection or Effective Date, whichever is later.     \n    Thereafter, routine compliance reviews will be conducted by the   \n    Monitor every 180 days until this Agreement is terminated.  Such \n    routine compliance reviews will assess the Parish’s  compliance with\n    each of the substantive remedial measures set forth in Section III.   \n \n  b) \t\t\t\t The United States may determine that an additional compliance  \n    review or reviews is necessary due to emergent issues at the Facility  \n    (including the death of a youth or receipt of credible allegations of  \n    sexual abuse by staff or youth) or recurring problems with substantive  \n    provision(s) of the Agreement.  If the United States believes that such  \n    additional compliance reviews are necessary, the Facility shall provide  \n    access to the Monitor and/or the United States within 48 hours of the  \n  request.   \n \nc) \t\t\t\t At each compliance review, the Monitor shall have the responsibility \nand authority to independently observe, assess, review, and report on \nthe Parish’s implementation and compliance with the provisions of this \nAgreement.  In order to accurately assess conditions at the Facility, the \nMonitor shall:  conduct on-site inspections; observe programs and \nactivities; interview pertinent administrators, professional staff, direct \ncare staff, and contractors; individually interview a sample of youth; \nreview a sampling of videotapes from housing units; and conduct \ndetailed reviews of youth records and other pertinent documents and \nreports.  The Monitor shall spend a sufficient amount of time at the \nFacility in order to accurately assess day-to-day operations and \n \n\n \nconditions.  The Monitor shall be responsible for independently \nverifying representations from the Parish regarding progress toward \ncompliance. \n \nd) \t\t\t\t Within sixty (60) days after each compliance review, the Monitor shall \nfile with the Court a final consolidated report which describes the steps \ntaken by the Parish to implement this Agreement, evaluates the extent \nto which the Parish has complied with each substantive provision of \nthe Agreement, cites the evidence upon which such evaluation is \nbased, and provides recommendations.  Each report shall be provided \nto the Parties in draft form for comment within twenty-eight (28) days \nafter each compliance review, and the Parties shall have twenty (20) \ndays after receipt of the draft report to comment on the report before it \nis finalized by the Monitor.  Neither Party, however, shall have \nauthority over the Monitor’s reports, findings, or recommendations.  \n \ne) \t\t\t\t For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with this Agreement, the \n  Monitor shall have reasonable access to:  the buildings and grounds of\n  the Facility; Facility documents and records; Facility officials,\n  employees, agents, and independent contractors; Parish officials, \n  employees, agents, and independent contractors; and youth residing at \n  the Facility, including the right to meet with youth privately.  Prior to  \n  each compliance visit, the Facility shall provide the Monitor with the \n  names and contact information of youth who have been released from\n  the Facility within the previous reporting period.  The Monitor shall \n  have the right to conduct unannounced visits to the Facility; however, \n  the Monitor shall generally coordinate the timing of on-site Facility \n  visits and requests for documents so as to minimize disruption to \n  Facility operations and Parish employee work functions.     \n  \n77.  Settlement Agreement Coordinator.  The Parish shall appoint a\nsettlement agreement coordinator to oversee compliance with this Agreement.  The \nsettlement agreement coordinator shall: \n \na)   \t\t\t \t    Be responsible for coordinating all document and information requests \n  from the Monitor and the United States;  \n \nb)   \t\t\t \t    Coordinate all on-site visits, including document and information \n  requests prior to each on-site visit by the Monitor and/or the United \nStates; \n \nc) \t\t\t\t       Catalog all incident reports, documents, and other source data used to \n  compile the monthly reports outlined herein to ensure that they can be \n  produced upon request by the Monitor and/or the United States; and \n \n\n \n \nd) \t\t\t\t       Supervise and ensure that all of the document maintenance, data \n  collection, and reporting requirements under this Agreement are met \n  on a timely basis. \n \n78.  Document Development and Revision.  The Parish shall timely revise \nand/or develop policies and procedures, forms, screening tools, blank log forms, and \nother documents as necessary to ensure that they are consistent with, incorporate, \naddress, and implement all provisions of this Agreement.  To the extent that a \nprovision within this Agreement requires the development and/or implementation \nof a policy or procedure, such provision shall not be effective until the Facility and \nthe United States have complied with the terms of this provision. \n \nThe Parish shall provide all such documents to the United States for its review \nwithin thirty (30) days of the Effective Date.  Within forty-five (45) days of its \nreceipt of the policies, procedures and other written documents, the United States \nshall provide either written approval of each document, or written concerns or \nobjections it has to the documents that include proposed revisions.  Such approval\nshall not be unreasonably withheld.  In the event that the United States asserts \nthat policies, procedures, or other written documents are not in compliance with the \nterms of this Agreement, the Parties will confer on the matter for up to thirty (30) \ndays.  If, after conferring for thirty (30) days, the parties are unable to reach an \nagreement, the Parties shall submit a Motion(s) to the Court outlining the \ndisagreement and seeking the Court’s resolution of the disagreement.    \n \nIf, after the policies, procedures, and practices affected by this Agreement are \nimplemented, any of the Parties determines  that a policy, procedure, or practice, as \nimplemented, fails to effectuate the terms of this Agreement, the Parish shall \nconsult with the United States and revise the policy, procedure, or practice to \neffectuate the terms of this Agreement. \n \n79.  Request for Technical Assistance.  The United States, at its discretion, \nand the Monitor agree to provide technical assistance to the Parish for \npolicy/procedure development.   \n \n80.  United States’ Access to Facility and Records.  The United States shall \nhave full and complete access to:  the buildings and grounds of the Facility; Facility\ndocuments and records; Parish documents and records; Facility officials, employees, \nagents, and independent contractors; Parish officials, employees, agents, and \nindependent contractors; and youth residing at the Facility, including the right to \nmeet with youth and staff privately.  The United States shall have the right to \nconduct unannounced visits to the Facility; however, the United States shall \ngenerally coordinate the timing of its on-site Facility visits and requests for \ndocuments so as to minimize disruption to Facility operations and Parish \n \n\n \nemployees’ work functions. Such access shall continue until this Agreement is \nterminated. \n \n81.  Response to Questions.  Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of written \nquestions from the United States regarding the Parish’s compliance with this \nAgreement, the Parish shall provide the United States with written answers and \naccess to any requested documents regarding the Parish’s compliance with the \nrequirements of this Agreement.  \n \n82.  Monitor’s Response to Questions.  Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of \nwritten questions from the United States or the Parish regarding a Monitor’s \nactivities in assessing compliance with this Agreement and/or the Parish’s \ncompliance with this Agreement, the Monitor shall provide the United States with \nwritten answers.    \n \n83.   Notification to the United States of Incidents.  The Parish shall notify\nthe United States no later than one business day after the Parish becomes aware of \nthe following categories of incidents:  youth death; youth injury resulting in\ntransport of the youth to the emergency room or requiring hospitalization; group \ndisturbance; use of the restraint practices and techniques being eliminated in \naccordance with the provisions above; and allegations of physical or sexual abuse or \nmisconduct by staff. \n \na)    \t\t\t\t    The Parish shall timely forward to the United States copies of all \n  incident report packets and final reports of investigations related to \n  such incidents, as well as any autopsies, medical records, mortality \n  reviews, and death summaries. \n \nb)    \t\t\t\t    For the purposes of this provision, the requirement to notify the United \n  States is met when the Parish contacts at least one of the Special \n  Litigation Section trial attorneys assigned to this matter and receives \n  written confirmation of such contact.   \nV.  ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION \n \n84.  Notice Prior to Judicial Action.  With the exception of conditions or\npractices that pose an immediate and serious threat to the life, health, or safety of \nyouth, if the United States believes that the Parish has failed to substantially \ncomply with any obligation under this Agreement, the United States shall give \nwritten notice of the failure to the Parish prior to seeking judicial enforcement of \nthe Agreement. \n \na) \t\t\t\t With the exception of an immediate or serious threat to life, health, or \nsafety of youth residing at the Facility, the Parish shall have thirty \n \n\n \n(30) days from the date of such written notice to cure the failure and \nprovide the United States with sufficient proof of its cure if the failure \ncan be cured within thirty (30) days.  If the failure cannot be cured \nwithin thirty (30) days, the Parish shall promptly submit a plan to cure \nthe failure, but, in any event, the failure shall be cured no later than \nforty-five (45) days from receipt of the written notice.   \n \nb) \t\t\t\t If either the Parish or the United States believes or if the Parties agree \nthat modification of this Agreement is required to cure the failure, the \nParty or Parties shall move the Court to modify the Agreement.  \n \nc) \t\t\t\t If the Parties agree to a plan to cure an alleged violation and the \nUnited States believes that the violation has still not been cured, the \nUnited States shall provide at least fifteen (15) days notice before filing \nany motion with the Court. \n \nd) \t\t\t\t In the event a disagreement occurs, the United States and the Parish \ncommit to work in good faith to resolve disputes; provided, however, \nnothing in this subparagraph shall impede resolution of a matter \ndeemed by the United States to present an immediate and serious \nthreat to the life, health, or safety of youth. \n \ne) \t\t\t\t Parish reserves the right to seek judicial review, upon motion to the \nCourt, in the event the United States makes a determination that the \nParish has failed to substantially comply with any obligation under \nthis Agreement. \n \n85. \t\t\t\t Termination.  This Agreement shall terminate in accordance with the \nfollowing conditions: \n \na) \t\t\t\t This Agreement will terminate in its entirety when the United States \ncertifies that the Parish is in substantial compliance with all \nprovisions of this Agreement for twelve (12) consecutive months.  \n \nb) \t\t\t\t      The Parties, in conjunction with the Monitor, may place certain \nprovisions in “inactive” monitoring if the Parties, including the \nMonitor, agree that a particular provision has been in substantial \ncompliance for twelve (12) consecutive months.  However, based on \ngood cause, the United States may place a previously inactive \nprovision into an active monitoring status by notifying the Parish, in \nwriting, at any time that this Agreement is in effect. \n \nc) \t\t\t\t The Parish may, at any time during the term of this Agreement, \nrequest that the United States certify that the Parish has maintained \n \n\n \nsubstantial compliance with all provisions of this Agreement for twelve \n(12) consecutive months.

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  On November 19, 2009, the United States, through the Department of \nJustice, (“the United States”) notified the Parish of Terrebonne, Louisiana \n(“Parish”) of its intention to investigate the conditions of confinement at the \nTerrebonne Parish Juvenile Detention Center Facility (“Facility”), pursuant to the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 \n(“Section 14141”). \n \n2.  On March 22-25, 2010, the United States conducted an on-site inspection of \nthe Facility with experts in juvenile protection from harm and secure detention.  \nThe United States has reviewed relevant Facility policies and procedures, reports, \nlogs, video recordings, and other relevant documents and data, and interviewed \nFacility staff and detainees. \n \n3.   On January 18, 2011, the United States issued an investigative findings \nletter which concluded that certain conditions at the Facility violated the \nconstitutional rights of juveniles detained or committed to the Facility (“Findings \nLetter”).

The scored risk factors should \ninclude a youth’s prior institutional misconduct.  The policy shall specify the \nprocedures for initial and re-classification, housing assignments, and supervision \nprocedures flowing from the assessment of risk.  The policy should include timelines \nfor classification and the events or incidents that trigger reclassification.  Because \nof the limited housing units available, the Facility may consider enhanced \nsupervision plans and other measures to ensure that youth located in the same \nhousing unit are sufficiently supervised and that staff are informed accordingly. \n \n65.  Housing and Supervision.  All youth should be initially classified in \naccordance with this provision within 24 hours of entry to the Facility and should \nnot be placed in a regular housing unit until properly classified.
