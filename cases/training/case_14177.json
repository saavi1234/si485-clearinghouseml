    "summary": "<p>On August 14, 2009, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division (DOJ) began an investigation of conditions at the Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center (\"LCJDC\") in Greenwood, Mississippi pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997, and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141.</p><p>On March 31, 2011, the DOJ issued an investigative findings letter concluding that conditions at LCJDC violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of the youth confined there. The United States concluded that youth confined to LCJDC are: (1) exposed to excessive physical restraint and isolation as a means of discipline; (2) given inadequate educational opportunities; and (3) exposed to great risk of harm from inadequate mental health care, including inadequate screening, monitoring and treatment of suicidal youth. The letter noted that the DOJ hoped to work with the County to reach an amicable and cooperative resolution, otherwise a lawsuit may be initiated.</p><p>On May 12, 2015, the DOJ filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. The DOJ sued Leflore County of Mississippi under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Represented by its own counsel, the DOJ sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The DOJ alleged that, in the course of operating a detention center for children, the defendant County had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by practicing inadequate suicide prevention policies, failing to investigate abuse, and causing unreasonable risk to the safety and welfare of the minor prisoners. The day after the complaint was filed, the parties jointly moved for entry of a settlement agreement.</p><p>This case was originally assigned to Judge Debra M. Brown and Magistrate Judge Jane M. Virden but was reassigned to Judge Neal B. Biggers after Judge Brown recused herself on May 18, 2015.</p><p>On June 18, 2015, Judge Biggers granted the joint motion for entry of settlement agreement. The settlement required the defendant County to first conduct a policy review, submit to the DOJ alternatives to policies not accepted by the DOJ, and then implement the approved alternatives. The policy areas of focus were inmate intake, screening and evaluation, policies and procedures regarding mental health, medical history, education, classification, and orientation, the use of force, behavior management, the use of forced isolation as punishment, suicide preventions, and due process/grievance processes. The defendant was required to train its staff regarding these policy changes. Additionally, the County was required to submit a comprehensive action plan for implementation and give annual compliance reports. The agreement was to terminate after the defendant County achieved substantial compliance with all substantive provisions of the agreement and has maintained compliance for at least 12 months. The court was to retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance. As of June 8, 2020, there is no indication on the docket that the settlement agreement has terminated, so presumably, the case is ongoing for compliance purposes.</p>",

      "text": "u.s. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nOffice ofthe Assistant Attorney General  Washington, D.C. 20530 \nMAR  31 2011 \nThe Honorable Robert Moore \nChair, Leflore County Board of Supervisors \n306 West Market Street \nGreenwood, Mississippi  38930-4355 \nRe:  Investigation ofthe Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center \nDear Chairman Moore: \nI write to report the fmdings ofthe Civil Rights Division's investigation of conditions at \nthe Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center (\"LCJDC\") in Greenwood, Mississippi.  On \nAugust 14, 2009, we notified Leflore County, Mississippi, of our intent to conduct an \ninvestigation ofLCJDC pursuant to the Civil Rights ofInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997 (\"CRIPA\"), and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994,42 U.S.C. \n§ 14141 (\"Section 14141\").  Both CRIPA and Section 14141 give the United States Department \nofJustice (\"DOJ\") authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates \nthe constitutional or federal statutory rights ofyouth in juvenile justice institutions. \nWe thank the staff members at LCJDC for their helpful and professional conduct \nthroughout the course ofthe investigation.  We received complete cooperation and appreciate \ntheir receptiveness to our consultants' on-site recommendations.  Staff assisted our investigation \nby providing access to records and personnel and by promptly responding to our requests in a \ntransparent manner.  We have every reason to believe that the County and the staff ofLCJDC are \ncommitted to remedying deficiencies at the facility. \nI.  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS \nThe youth confmed to LCJDC are subjected to conditions that violate their constitutional \nand federal statutory rights.  Our investigation revealed systemic, egregious, and dangerous \nabuses perpetuated by a lack of accountability and controls.  LCJDC fails to prevent \nunconstitutional harms, or minimize the risk of such harms, through undue use ofrestraints, \narbitrary imposition ofpunishment, inadequate grievance procedures, failure to report and \ninvestigate abuse, inadequate classification systems, inadequate rehabilitative treatment, \ninadequate medical and mental health care, inadequate suicide risk protections, inadequate \nenvironmental safety, inadequate staffmg, and inadequate educational services.  We found that: \n\n-2 -\n• \t Youth are dangerously and routinely shackled to metal beds for discipline and  \npunishment;  \n• \t Staff have unfettered discretion to immediately administer punishment, and isolation is \nused excessively for punishment and control; \n• \t Suicidal youth are not assessed by mental health professionals despite known risks; \n• \t Internal investigations dismiss abuse complaints against staff as manipulative; and \n• \t No accoITunodations exist for children with learning disabilities. \nThese systemic deficiencies exist because generally accepted juvenile justice standards \nare not followed.  We found that LCJDC staff members do not receive minimally adequate \ntraining and that existing policies and procedures are inadequate to ensure constitutionally \nadequate care and custody ofthe youth confined to the facility.  Staff members fail to report \nallegations of abuse to the State and appear to routinely violate youths' rights with impunity. \nThe widespread and significant deficiencies at the facility are a result of significant \ndepartures from accepted juvenile justice standards and violate the Fourteenth Amendment's \nmandate that youth in custody be protected from harm.  In this letter, we provide \nrecommendations that are minimally necessary to bring the facility into compliance with the \nConstitution and federal law. \nll. INVESTIGATION \nOn November 11-12,2009, we conducted an on-site inspection ofLCJDC accompanied \nby expert consultants in the areas of protection from harm and education.  Before, during, and \nafter our tour, we reviewed extensive documentation provided by the County, including policies \nand procedures, incident reports, unitlogs,and training materials.  Additionally, we interviewed \nLCJDC administrators, staff, and youth.  We observed youths in a variety of settings, including \ntheir living units, dining areas, and in the facility's only classroom.  Consistent with our \ncommitment to conduct a transparent investigation and provide technical assistance, our expert \nconsultants conveyed their initial impressions and concerns to the County during exit \nconferences held at the conclusion ofthe tour. \nIll. BACKGROUND \nThe LCJDC is a 30-bed short-term facility owned and operated by Leflore County for the \ndetention of youth.  Male and female youth between 10 and 17 years of age are detained at \nLCJDC for periods ranging from a few hours to more than 30 days.  In addition to detaining \nyouth from Leflore County, the facility contracts with 19 other Mississippi counties to detain \nyouth.1  As required by state statute, LCJDC and other juvenile justice facilities in Mississippi \nare monitored by the State Department of Public Safety's Juvenile Detention Facilities \nMonitoring Unit on a quarterly basis.  Despite the relatively limited bed capacity ofLCJDC, the \nnumber of youths detained at the facility, over time, is significant.  During the period between \nThe counties that contract with Leflore County for juvenile detention include Attala, Bolivar, Calhoun, \nCarroll, Choctaw, Coahoma, Grenada, Holmes, Humphrey, Leake, Montgomery, Panola, Quitman, Sunflower, \nTallahatchie, Tate, Tunica, Yalobusha, and Webster. \n\n--~.-.--~~-.---=~.~-----.-.•~.~====~============~ \n- 3 -\nJuly 2008 and September 2009, 544 different youths were held at the facility.  Notably, some of \nthese 544 youths were detained at the facility multiple times during the time period.  During our \non-site visit in November 2009, the facility had a youth population of seven males and six \nfemales who were from eight different counties. \nThe two-story LCJDC building was converted from a mental health facility to a juvenile \nfacility in 1995, with the original construction dating back to the 1950s.  In addition to LCJDC, \nthe building houses the Leflore County Youth Court and offices for the court's counselors.  The \njuvenile detention portion ofthe building consists oftwo floors and is outfitted like an adult jail. \nThe layout is primarily double-bunked cells with metal frame beds, built-in desks or tables, and \nstainless steel toilets and sinks.  Each cell has a metal door with a small window, and lighting is \ncontrolled externally by a switch near the door.  The upper level customarily houses female \nyouths and includes the facility's only classroom, which is outfitted with books, desks, and an \nadjacent computer lab.  The lower level ofLCJDC customarily houses male youths and has a \n'\nsmall dayroom for programming in addition to cells.  An external door on the10wer level \nhallway connects the cells to a very small outdoor \"recreation area\" that is completdy enclosed \nby tall brick walls.  This outdoor recreation area is designated as the point of egress in case of \nfire or other emergency.  . \nIV.  FINDINGS \nIn violation oftheir constitutional rights, youth at LCJDC are inappropriately and \ndangerously restrained, arbitrarily punished, denied adequate medical and mental health care; not \nprotected from suicide risk, inadequately supervised, and inadequately educated.  Unsafe \nconditions ofconfinement, combined with a paucity ofmeaningful programming, education and \nother activities, create an environment at LCJDC that is dangerous and detrimental to youth \ndevelopment and well-being.  The environment is especially harmful for those youth who spend \nlong periods oftime at LCJDC or who frequently return to the facility. \nA. \t LEFLORE COUNTY IS FAILING TO PROTECT YOUTH FROM HARM AT \nLCJDC \nCRIPA   and Section 14141 authorize DOJ to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of \nconduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights ofyouth in juvenile justice \ninstitutions.  42 US.C. § 1997; 42 U.S.C. § 14141.  Youth detained at LCJDC are protected by \nthe Fourteenth Amendm~nt and have a substantive due process right to reasonably safe \nconditions ofconfmement and freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints.  Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315-16 (1982) (\"If it is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted \ncriminals in unsafe conditions, it must be unconstitutional to confine the involuntarily [detained] \n- who may not be punished at all- in unsafe conditions.\").  The Fourteenth Amendment, rather \nthan the Eighth Amendment, applies because the youth are held for detention or rehabilitation, \n\n-------------_._-._----_-.. ------.-----~.--..--.-----~--.-...--.---------------------..--.------------_-.._-.- ----~----\n-4-\nnot punishment. 2  The Mississippi youth delinquency statute's statement ofpurpose provides \nthat \"each child coming within the jurisdiction ofthe youth court ... become a responsible, \naccountable and productive citizen, and that each such child shall receive such care, guidance \nand control, preferably in such child's own home as is conducive toward that end and is in the \nstate's and the child's best interest.\"  Miss. Code Ann. § 43-21-103. \nTo determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment was violated, a balancing test must be \napplied:  \"[I]t is necessary to balance 'the liberty ofthe individual' and 'the demands of an \norganized society.'\"  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 320 (quoting Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542 \n(1961)).  The Youngberg Court went on to hold that \"Ifthere is to be any uniformity in \nprotecting these interests, this balancing cannot be left to the unguided discretion of a judge or \njury.\"  Id. at 321.  Instead, the Court held that there is a constitutional violation if detaining \nofficials substantially depart from generally accepted professional standards, and that departure \nendangers youth in their care.  See id. at 314. \nAs a general matter, the Supreme Court has held that corrections officials must take \nreasonable steps to guarantee detainees' safety and provide \"humane conditions\" of confmement. \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994); Hare v. City of Corinth, 74 F.3d 633,639 (5th Cir. \n1996) (recognizing a duty to provide detainees with basic human needs including protection \nfrom harm).  In addition, an official's failure to maintain adequate policies, procedures, and \npractices for the prevention of suicides may violate a detainee's due process rights.  Silva v. \nDonley County Texas, 32 F.3d 566, 1994 WL 442404, *5-7 (5th Cir. 1994) (unpublished) \n(holding sheriffs failure to establish suicide detection and prevention training for jail personnel, \ncondoning de facto policy of sporadic cell checks, and absence of a policy for observing \"at-risk\" \ndetainees may rise to deliberate indifference to known risk of suicide in detention settings). \nFinally, conditions of confmement claims may be based not only upon existing physical \nharm to youth, but also on conditions that threaten to cause future harm.  Helling v. McKinney, \n509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (stating \"[i]t would be odd to deny [relief to detainees] who plainly \nproved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their [facility] on the ground that nothing yet had \nhappened to them.\").  In Helling, the court recognized various circuit courts holding that \"a \n[detainee] need not wait until he is actually assaulted before obtaining relief\"  and that the \nConstitution \"protects against sufficiently imminent dangers.\" Id. at 33-34; see also Herman v. \nHoliday, 238 F.3d 660 (5th Cir. 2001) (recognizing Helling standard); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d \n1291, 1308-11 (5th Cir. 1974) (holding that failure to provide adequate systems to protect \ninmates against future harm including physical assaults and abuse constituted cruel and unusual \npunishment).  . \n2  In Ingraham v. Wright, the Supreme Court rejected application of the Eighth Amep.dment deliberative \nindifference standard in a non-criminal context.  430 U.S. 651, 669 n.37 (1977) (\"Eighth Amendment scrutiny is \nappropriate only after the State has complied with the constitutional guarantees traditionally associated with criminal \nprosecutions.\").  In addition, the Court held that the Due Process Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment was the \nproper constitutional gauge to determine the rights of adults detained by a state, but not yet convicted of any crime. \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  See also, Scott v. Moore, 85 F.3d 230,235 (5th Cir. 1996). At a minimum, \nyouth should be accorded the same constitutional protections. \n\n- 5 -\n1.  Youth at LCJDC are subjected to undue restraint. \nOur investigation revealed numerous uses of dangerous and unnecessary restraints. at \nLCJDC.  The justifications offered by staff for the use ofthe restraints were ambiguous or \nclearly inappropriate.  Youth are frequently shackled to the bed in their cell in response to non-\ndangerous actions and for punishment.  Documentation of the application of restraints failed to \nadequately describe the reasons for or the duration ofthe uses of restraint.3 \nYouth at LCJDC may not be unduly restrained or subjected to excessive use offorce by \nstaff.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 316; Morales v. Turman, 364 F. Supp. 166, 173 (B.D. Tex. \n1973) (issuing a preliminary injunction where the court found that juvenile facilities' widespread \npractice ofbeating, slapping, kicking, and otherwise abusing youth in the absence of exigent \ncircumstances violated youths' rights).  In determining whether a violation exists under the \nEighth Amendment, courts consider whether \"force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain \nor restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm\" to \ndetermine whether force was excessive.  Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1,6 (1992) (citing \nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312,320-21 (1986).  Prison officials \"may take all reasonable steps \nto insure proper prison discipline, security and order\" but must ensure ''that inmates are not \nsUbjected to any punishment beyond that which is necessary for [ ] orderly administration.\" \nGates v. Collier, 501 F.2d at 1309.  Hence, the use offorce after an inmate has been subdued and \nan emergency has, dissipated, or which is disproportionate to the force needed to regain control, \nviolates the Eighth Amendment.  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 738 (2002) (leaving an inmate \nhandcuffed to a post after order had been regained constituted cruel and unusual punishment); \nValencia v. Wiggins, 981 F. 2d 1440, 1447 (5th Cir. 1993) (applying a chokehold on disruptive \ninmate who refused to exit cell and striking inmate while handcuffed, kneeling, and non-resisting \nwas malicious and sadistic, causing harm) . .The use of mechanical restraints should be limited to \ncircumstances where a youth presents a clear danger to herself or others.  See H.C. by Hewett v. \nJarrard, 786 F.2d 1080, 1086 (l1th Cir. 1986) (disproportionate response of guard to juvenile \ndetainee, which included shackling to bed, \"amounted to punishment in violation of due process \nclause\"). \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that staff only use physical force or \nmechanical restraints to the degree and duration necessary to bring a situation under controL \nEvery application ofmechanical restraints - including handcuffs, leg shackles, belly chains, or \nother such restraints - must be fully documented, including the circumstances leading to the \napplication of restraints and the duration that the restraints were applied.  Any restrained juvenile \nshould be constantly observed by staff to ensure safety. \n3  •  The facility's policy manual is ambiguous about the County's expectation for documenting uses offorce. \nOne section states that the \"use of force resulting in injury to staff or youth and the use ofmechanical restraints will \nbe fully documented and reported,\" suggesting that only use offorce incidents involving injury should be \ndocumented.  Several pages later, however, the manual states that a \"written report ... will be completed no later \nthan seventy-two (72) hours following the incident depending on the circumstances ofthe incident.\" There is no \nexplanation ofthe determinative circumstances, and the quote suggests that incident reports are required even where \nthere is no injury.  Regardless ofwhich part ofthe policy manual is the County's official policy, neither is consistent \nwith generally accepted professional standards, which provide that facility staff document all incidents, except for \nhandcuffs used in transportation, in which physical force or mechanical restraints are used. \n\n- 6 -\nExamples ofexcessive or undue restraints and lack ofadequate documentation at LCJDC \ninclude: \n• \t In October 2008, A.A.,4 a 13 year old detainee, began kicking his cell door and \ncursing.  Two officers entered the youth's cell and \"chained\" A.A. to the bed.  There \nis no documentation ofthe precise manner or length oftime that the youth was \nrestrained.  Staff later entered A.A. 's room to discover that he had defecated and \nthrown feces on the cell window.  He was restrained a third time in November 2008 \nfor 15 minutes as punishment for kicking and beating on the door. \n• \t B.B. was placed in leg restraints in October 2008 as punishment for flooding the toilet \nin his cell.  He was released once he promised to stop flooding the cell. \n• \t In February 2009, C.C. was removed from class and isolated in his cell for failure to \nfollow classroom rules.  Once C.C. entered his cell, he began beating on the doors \nand walls.  Two officers then entered the cell and placed C.C. in leg shackles. \n• \t In June 2009, leg irons were placed on D.D. to prevent him from banging on the cell \ndoor.  There is no documentation' regarding the duration ofthis restraint. \n• \t In May 2010, a youth banged on his door to request hygienic tissue.  A detention \nofficer denied the request, and detention staff subsequently went from room to room \nrestraining youths with shackles and handcuffs.  One youth was hogtied to the bed \nafter he argued with detention officers, and all youths remained in the restraints for \napproximately one hour. \nIn none ofthe circumstances described above were the youths a danger to themselves or \nto others.  Banging or kicking doors or walls, cursing, shouting, and flooding a cell are annoying \nbehaviors, but none present a danger.  Instead, in each ofthe incidents described above, \nLCJDC's practice of shackling served a primarily punitive purpose.  Therefore, each restraint \ndescribed above was undue and unconstitutional. \nStaff members at LCJDC freely admit that they restrain youth to beds.  According to \nfacility staff, youth are restrained to the bed when staff cannot de-escalate a youth's misbehavior \nthrough talking (although none ofthe incidents described above evidence attempts by staffto de-\nescalate the situation before restraints were applied).  The facility manual places a time limit of \n15 to 30 minutes on the use ofrestraints.  We were also told that staffusually link restraint \ndevices together to provide enough length for youth to use the toilet while shackled to a bed. \nNeither the purported time constraint nor extending the length ofthe shackling restraint makes \nthis practice acceptable. \nWe conclude that the restraint practices ofLCJDC detention staff violate the Constitution \nand egregiously deviate from generally accepted professional standards. \n4  Fictional initials are used throughout the letter to preserve the anonymity ofyouths. \n\n- 7 -\n2. \t LCJDC violates the due process rights of youth by arbitrarily imposing \npunitive measures. \nOur investigation revealed numerous instances where LCJDC staff imposed sanctions \nwithout following any disciplinary process.  LCJDC must provide youth with procedural due \nprocess ifthey are charged with a disciplinary violation while detained.  See Wolffv. \nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-65 (1974) (finding that prison disciplinary hearings require due \nprocess with respect to presentation of charges, evidence, and witnesses). \nThere are no processes at LCJDC for notifying youth offacility rules or for imposing \ndiscipline.  The absence of an established disciplinary system results in an informal system of \ncontrol based on the unfettered discretion ofindividual detention officers; sanctions are \nimmediately imposed by staff for whatever actions staff deem punishable.  These practices are \nunconstitutional.  For example:  . \n• \t\nIn August 2008, staff recorded in a facility log that E.E. and F.F. had fought each \nother and were therefore not allowed out oftheir cells for any reason other than \nshowering. \n• \t In September 2008, G.G. allegedly started a fight in class and was therefore isolated \nin his cell.  According to the facility log, the youth was \"to not come out ofhis cell .. \n. for any reason.\"  It is unclear how long this restriction was in place. \n• \t In November 2008, H.H. reportedly became disruptive and threatened to kill himself \nwhile in court.  Two detention officers forcibly removed H.H. from the courtroom \nand placed him in his cell.  After the youth struck the door of his cell, \"disciplinary \nactions were taken.\" We have no indication ofwhat is meant by \"disciplinary \nactions.\" \n• \t In February 2009, some youths were allegedly overheard plotting to attack a \ndetention officer.  Consequently, \"all juveniles were disciplined by no showering.\" \n• \t\nThirteen-year-old I.!. stated during our November 2009 interviews that one ofthe \ndetention officers at LCJDC had whipped him with a belt in his room as punishment \nfor being disruptive in class. \nThe lack of any disciplinary system or due process protections for youth at LCJDC \nviolates their constitutional rights. \n3. \t LCJDC is unlawfully failing to report and investigate abuse. \nLCJDC also unconstitutionally places youth at risk ofrepeated harm by failing to . \nproper ly report and investigate abuse by staff.  When an allegation of child abuse is made, the \nallegation should be reported to the proper authorities for investigation.  Juvenile justice facility \nstaff are typically mandated by statute to report allegations of child abuse to the state's child \n\n- 8 -\nprotective services agency.  In Mississippi, \"any person having reasonable cause to suspect that a \nchild is a neglected child or an abused child shall cause an oral report to be made immediately ... \nto the Department of Human Services\" which in turn initiates an investigation.  Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 43-21-353 (1) (2010).  As such, LCJDC staff must report all instances of alleged abuse, \nwithout regard to credibility, to the State Department ofHuman Services.  This is not occurring. \nIn addition to reporting allegations of abuse to the proper state agency, LCJDC must \nconduct internal investigations of alleged abuse in order to keep youth reasonably safe.  Once an \nallegation of abuse has been made, a proper investigation is required to protect youth from staff \nabuse by collecting evidence to verify or disprove the allegation.  These investigations are \nessential to identify staff in need oftraining and/or discipline, as well as to clear staffwho have  \nbeen wrongfully accused.  The investigation process must have reasonable integrity, preserve all  \nphysical evidence (e.g., videotape footage, documentation and photographs of injuries, clothing,  \n. etc.), obtain statements from all youth and staff involved in the incident and those who witnessed  \nthe incident, and utilize other sources of information to corroborate or refute the allegations (e.g., \nlogbooks, other sources offacility documentation). \nTo ensure that youth are provided adequate safety, youth subjected to a use of force must \nbe seen, and treated ifnecessary, by a medical professional, and all injuries should be \ndocumented.  Medical staff can also be an avenue for youth to report abuse or mistreatment. \nFurther, even when youth do not report abuse or mistreatment, medical staff members are \nmandated reporters of childabuse if abuse is suspected due to the nature of an injury. \nLCJDC unlawfully fails to provide these protections.  The facility does not have adequate \nprocedures for properly reporting and investigating allegations of child abuse.  When asked \nabout procedures that staff follow upon receiving an allegation ofabuse, staff members were \nunaware oftheir duty to report abuse allegations to the State.  Further, internal investigations are \ncursory and do not include examination by medical staff, photographs of alleged injuries, or \nother basic elements necessary for accurate investigations.  Indeed, it appears that the underlying \nassumption of any facility investigation of abuse is that the complaining youth is attempting to \nmanipulate others.  The following examp~es illustrate the deficiencies with LCJDC \ninvestigations: \n• \t In February 2008, youth lJ. alleged that he was sexually assaulted by a staff member \nand later attempted suicide at the facility.  Facility management conducted an \negregiously deficient investigation by speaking with the youth, then speaking with the \nstaff member, and then simply concluding that there was no evidence of a sexual \nassault.  There is no indication that the State was contacted regarding the abuse \nallegations.  In a memorandum notifying a local police chief ofthe results ofthe \ninvestigation, LCJDC' s director stated that J.J. was \"using the system against the \nsystem to gain sympathy\" in order to avoid a possible felony charge.  The memo \nconcludes with the exhortation:  \"Do not let this troubled young man's false \nallegations stop [the County] from allowing Leflore County to serving [ sic] your \nJuvenile Detainment Needs.\" \n\n- 9 -\n• \t AJanuary 2009 memorandum reports the conclusion ofthe facility's grossly \ninadequate investigation into youth K.K. 's allegations that he was assaulted by an \nLCJDC custody officer.  The investigation consisted ofthe director and assistant \ndirector interviewing the accused officer and the officer's supervisor, both ofwhom \ndenied the assault.  The memorandum notes that K.K. bore no visible signs of assault \nbut does not contain any alleged details of the incident, including the date it allegedly \noccurred.  The director asserts in the memorandum that \"[t]hese juvenile(s) will say \nand do anything to shift the concerns away from what they did or are doing.\"  There \nis no evidence indicating that these allegations were referred to the State. \nWe fmd that LCJDC' s reporting and investigation of alleged abuse is wholly deficient \nand unlawfully violates the rights ofthe young people detained in the facility. \n4.  LCJDC's unlawful classification system places youth at great risk. \nYouth at LCJDC are not safe due to the facility's inadequate classification system.  The \nConstitution requires that youth be provided a reasonably safe environment.  In a juvenile justice \nfacility, a critical piece ofkeeping youth safe turns on a classification system to determine where \nand with whom a youth should be housed.  The classification should take into account a youth's \nage, charge offense, history ofviolence and escape, vulnerability to victimization, gang \nmembership or affiliation, health and mental health concerns, and institutional history. \nLCJDC only considers a youth's size, age, and county ofresidence when making housing \nassignments.  The failure to account for other obviously relevant factors places youth at grave \nrisk ofharm.  During our interviews with youth at the facility, for example, we discovered that \nyouths L.L. and M.M. were both arrested and sent to LCJDC for fighting each other but were \ninexplicably assigned to share a cell together upon arrival at LCJDC.  In addition, youths N.N. \nand 0.0. independently told us that they were sharing a cell despite a conflict between them. \nBoth youths had repeatedly asked staff to separate them but no action had been taken. \nWe find that the lack of an adequate classification system at LCJDC places youth at an \nunacceptably high risk of victimization, does not keep youth reasonably safe, and is therefore \nunconstitutional. \n5.  LCJDC lacks adequate medical and mental health care. \nReasonable protection of confined youths' physicai and mental safety requires adequate \nmedical treatment, mental health treatment and suicide prevention measures.  See Youngberg, \n457 U.S. at 323-24 & 323 n.30; Morales, 364 F. Supp. at 175.  Appropriate care for youths' \nmental health needs is as important as caring for their medical needs.  Gates v. Cook, 376 F. 3d \n323, 332-33 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Partridge v. Two Unknown Police Officers of City of \nHouston, Texas, 791 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir. 1986)).  Further, providing only medication to \nyouth with psychiatric disabilities, in the absence of additional or other mental health services, \nviolates their constitutional rights.  Gates, 376 F. 3d at 335 (holding that the confinement of \ninmates with severe mental illness on Mississippi's death row with no mental health care other \n\n· - 10 -\nthan medication was \"grossly inadequate\" and constituted deliberate indifference in violation of \nthe Eighth Amendment). \nWhile we did not include experts in medical and mental health services in our \ninvestigatory tour, the obvious dearth of even the most basic medical and mental health care at \nLCJDC leads us to conclude that the constitutional rights ofdetained youth to adequate medical \nand mental health care are being violated. \na. \t LCJDC provides inadequate medical screenings and fails to seek \nappropriate medical treatment, placing youth at significant risk of \nserious harm. \nBy failing to properly screen youth for medical conditions, LCJDC remains deliberately \nindifferent to potentially serious harm.  In accordance with generally accepted juvenile justice \nstandards~ Mississippi state law requires that youth undergo a health screening upon admission to \na juvenile detention center, within one hour or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, in order \nto obtain information about the juvenile's mental health, suicide risk, alcohol and other drug use \nand abuse, physical health, aggressive behavior, family relations, peer relations, social skills, \neducational status, and vocationalstatus.  See Miss. Code Ann. § 43-21-321.  This statutory \nrequirement is acknowledged in LCJDC's manual, but documentation showed that facility staff \nmembers do not comply with this legal requirement. \nDocumentation purported to show that the 13 youth detained at the time ofour \ninvestigation tour had been screened in compliance with State law with respect to physical \nhealth.  However, upon close examination, that same documentation noted that four youth \nentered the facility at 12:23 p.m. on November 10,2009 and that medical screening for each of \nthe four youth was also completed at 12:23 p.m. that same day.  It is not credible that all four \nyouth were admitted and medically screened within the space ofone minute. \nWe found no evidence that LCJDC' s officers are trained by medical professionals on \nhow to conduct initial medical screenings.  Generally accepted professional standards require \nthat detention officers receive training from a health authority on conducting initial medical \nscreenings of youth.  Without proper medical screening by appropriately qualified staff, youth \nare subjected to a high risk that medical or mental health problems will be undetected and \nunaddressed at the facility. \nDuring individual interviews, our experts specifically noticed two youths, P.P. and Q.Q., \nwho exhibited behaviors consistent with neurological impairments (e.g., Traumatic Brain Injury, \ntic disorders) and/or other health issues.  The records for these two youths did not document \nthese explicit behaviors, and when we asked the facility director about the youths' medical \nstatus, he stated he had not noticed these signs.  Significantly, P.P. had been detained at LCJDC \non multiple occasions without any treatment for the possible disability. \n\n- 11 -\nBecause there are no medical personnel on-site, facility policy requires staff to take youth \nto see a physician if a medical screening indicates a need for emergency care or if a parent, \nguardian, or youth court designee makes a written request for medical care.  We found that, \ninstead, untraIned custody officers often provide basic medical care and improperly make \ndecisions on treatment.  For example: \n• \t In March 2008, R.R. began vomiting in her room.  Custody officers offered an over-\nthe-counter stomach medication to the resident, but she refused.  No other medical \naction was taken.  . \n• \t In June 2008, S.S. reported to a detention officer that he fell in his room and \ndislodged his tooth.  The detention officer and another staff member looked in S. S. 's \nmouth and reported that \"you could see that he pull[ed] the tooth out and he was \nOK.\" No further action was taken. \n• \t In December 2008, T.T. complained to facility staff that he was having chest pains. \nThe youth was taking lithium, a psychoactive drug often used for the treatment of \nbipolar disorder.  Like many psychoactive drugs, lithium may reach dangerously \ntoxic levels if not appropriately monitored by a medical professional and has a \nnumber of potentially serious adverse side effects.  We could find no evidence that \nB.V. was examined by a medical professional following his complaint ofchest pain. \n• \t In July 2009, V.V. complained that his stomach was upset on the same day that his \nmother called and advised the facility that V.V. did not have his asthma medication. \nThe next day, when V.V. complained of chest pain and began throwing up blood, a \ncustody officer reviewed the unit log and noted that no action had been taken the \nprevious day regarding the youth's illness.  V.V. was then taken to the hospital by \ncustody staff and diagnosed with bronchitis. \n• \t In May 2010, a juvenile at the facility was suffering from tooth pain and could not get \nattention from a detention officer until he began banging on the cell door.  One ofthe \ndetention officers entered the cell and beat the youth until the juvenile was wailing \nand crying.  The youth did not receive medical attention for the tooth. \nb. \t LCJDC is deliberately indifferent to suicide risks and the related \nserious mental health needs of youth, placing them at significant risk \nof serious harm. \nAmong the most dangerous practices at LCJDC is the facility's failure to meaningfully \nscreen or monitor potentially suicidal youth.  Youth at great risk ofharm are exposed to \nconditions that are not reasonably safe and are therefore unconstitutional. \nIn order to provide reasonable safety to potentially suicidal youth, all youth placed on \nsuicide precautions must be regularly monitored by mental health professionals.  Any staff \nperson may place a youth on suicide precautions initially, but the precautions should only be \n\n- ------\n- 12 -\nremoved following an assessment by a mental health professional.  At LCIDC, if a youth's \nscreening indicates a need for additional assessment, staff members are supposed to schedule an \nappointment with the local mental health clinic and transport the youth to the clinic.  This does \nnot occur.  Indeed, records demonstrate instances where youth who are placed on suicide \nprecautions by staff are never assessed by mental health professionals at any time during their \ndetention. \nDetention staff should also provide consistent monitoring of youth on suicide precautions \nto observe behavior and ensure the youth's safety and welfare.  LCIDC does not regularly \nmonitor youth while they are on suicide precautions, and it is unclear who decides when youth \nmay be removed from precautions.  For example: \n• \t In May 2008, V.V. was discovered tying a sheet around a pipe in his cell in an \nattempt to commit suicide.  Detention staff monitored the youth and required him to \nwear only a paper gown.  However, despite his suicidal behavior, no mental health \nprofessional ever assessed or treated V.V. \n• \t In June 2008, an officer bribed W.W. and X.X. to keep them quiet about an attempted \nsuicide.  W.W. reportedly knocked on her cell door continuously during X.X's \nattempted suicide in an effort to get the attention ofstaffbut was ignored by the two \nofficers on duty, one ofwhom (\"Officer 1\") was smoking a cigarette.  The officers \ncontinued to ignore W.W. until they heard her screaming.  Staff discovered that x.x. \nhad tied a blanket tightly around her neck and a railing on the ceiling.  After the noose \nwas removed by staff, Officer 1 told the two youths not to tell anyone about the \nincident, and allowed them to spend several hours eating snacks and playing \ncomputer games.  Officer 1 also told the other officer not to tell anyone about the \nincident, especially the director.  The incident was eventually reported and \ninvestigated.  Despite the facility director's recommendation that Officer 1 be \nterminated, Officer 1 remains at LCJDC. \n• \t In September 2008, Y.Y. began banging his head against the cell door and tied his \nuniform shirt around his neck.  Y.Y.'s cellmate notified two detention officers who \nthen entered the cell, removed the shirt, and placed Y.Y. in mechanical restraints. \nThe officers later returned to the cell after Y.Y. managed to tie a sheet around his \nneck despite the restraints.  The officers then removed the restraints, \"stripped\" Y.Y., \nplaced him in a paper gown, and re-applied mechanical restraints.  Y.Y. then \nattempted to tie the paper gown around his neck and stuffed tissue in his nose and \nmouth.  The incident report concludes by stating that the officers took away both the \ngown and the tissue.  No further action was taken. \n• \t A March 2009 mental health assessment of Z.Z. described him as \"suicidal and \npsychotic\" and in need of \"immediate attention.\"  He was placed in a paper gown and \nput on suicide watch after the assessment.  Five days later, though still on suicide \nprecautions, Z.Z. was observed in full clothing after staff returned his clothing in \n\n- 13 -\nviolation of a facility directive.  It is unclear when or ifZ.Z. was ever removed from \nsuicide watch during his 18-day detention at LCJDC. \n• \t In May 2009, A.B. was observed in his room crying, with a tom blanket tied tightly \naround his neck.  Detention staff removed the blanket and placed A.B. in a suicide \ngown, but he was not assessed by a mental health professional until three days later. \nA suicide watch log purportedly showed that the youth was observed by detention \nstaff every four minutes while on suicide watch, but the observational times and \ndetention officer's initials were typed in for the entire shift, calling into question the \nveracity ofthe observations.  Given the physical set-up ofthe facility, it is highly \nunlikely that the detention officer could have observed A.B. as reported on the suicide \nwatch log and typed in the information every four minutes. \n• \t In September 2009, A.C. was placed on suicide watch after a local mental health \nprofessional determined that he expressed suicidal ideations, intent to self harm, and \nauditory hallucinations.  The suicide watch log indicates that a detention officer \nobserved A.C. every four minutes.  The veracity ofthe observations is dubious, \nhowever, given that the times and officerls initials are all typed. \nFinally, suicide hazards remain in youth cells.  While the County has removed exposed \nmetal piping in many ofthe cells, some protrusions and tying offpoints still remain.  In sum, \nLCJDC's grossly inadequate suicide prevention practices violate youths' constitutional rights to \nadequate safety. and adequate mental health care, and place these youths at life-threatening risk. \n6.  LCJDC's fails to provide adequate programming. \nYouth at LCJDC have a constitutional right to adequate treatment.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 323; Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130, 1146-55 (D. Miss. 1977) (holding that juvenile \nfacility must provide adequate treatment, including proper behavior management and recreation \nprograms, among others).  That right is abrogated by LCJDC's failure to provide adequate \nprogramming and behavior management systems.  In order to provide constitutional care, \njuvenile justice facilities must provide rehabilitation programming and treatment while youth are \nconfined.  Thus, generally accepted professional standards require that juvenile justice facilities \nprovide education, recreation, and meaningful activities such as group and individual therapy, \nsocial skills training, and other programming.  LCJDC fails to provide these services, and the \nlack of structure and meaningful programming activity is not only violating the youths' rights but \nis predictably resulting in behavior problems. \nYouth at LCJDC spend an inordinate amount oftime playing cards or dominos while in \nthe small dayroom or while locked in their cells.  Besides schooling, the only regularly scheduled \nactivity for youth is a two-hour arts and crafts class held in the evenings twice per week.  On \nweekends, youth are allowed to watch television ifthey have behaved during the week and may \nattend religious programming on Sundays.  However, youth spend most weekend time locked in \ntheir cells.  Furthermore, recreational logs indicated long gaps between opportunities for youth to \nengage in large muscle exercise.  Although there is a small outdoor recreation yard outfitted with \n\n- 14 -\na basketball hoop, it appears to be rarely used and was not used during our November 2009 tour. \nDuring an interview, youth A.D. stated that he had been permitted outside for recreation only \ntwice during his 36-day period of detention.  Without activities to keep youths mentally and \nphysically occupied, youth at LCJDC create their own activities, including beating and kicking \nwalls and doors, yelling, cursing, picking fights, and other negative behavior. \nThe problems resulting from the paucity of programming activity are exacerbated by the \nlack of a behavior management program at LCJDC.  Children and adolescents typically lack \nstrong impulse control, and youths at juvenile detention facilities are often particularly affected \nby their lack of impulse control and lack of an ability to make good choices to control their \nbehavior.  Therefore, it is critical that a juvenile facility have in place a behavior management \nsystem that provides immediate, consistent, and tangible reinforcement of desired behaviors. \nAlthough LCJDC once purchased a behavior management system manual, it was never used. \nAccording to staff, LCJDC officials delayed implementing the system because they expected the \nfacility to move to a new building. \nWe find that LCJDC' s failure to provide adequate programming activity - regardless of \nthe facility's physical limitations-contributes to increased risk of suicide, violence and \nexcessive discipline and violates the youths' constitutional rights. \n7.  LCJDC fails to provide adequate staffing levels for supervision of youth. \nSome ofthe above described problems appear to have resulted from inadequate staffing. \nLCJDC's serious deficiencies in staffing places youth at risk of harm because of reduced \naccountability, overreliance on restraints, inadequate youth supervision, and inadequate suicide \nprevention practices.  This deficiency contributes to violations ofyouths' constitutional rights to \nreasonably safe conditions of confinement. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324. \nLCJDC operates with three detention officers for a population of up to twenty-four \nyouths ofboth genders.  The facility has no means to electronically monitor youth in their rooms \nin addition to visual ch~cks. With two floors and two control rooms, the current staffing pattern \nis inadequate for LCJDC, particularly when one or more youths are placed on suicide watch: \n8.  LCJDC fails to provide youth a reasonably safe living environment. \nLCJDC's physical environment poses an unreasonable risk to the safety and welfare of \ndetained youths.  The Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause requires juvenile justice \nfacilities to provide youth with conditions of reasonable care and safety. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at \n324.  LCJDC's failure to adequately address the risk ofthe spread of infectious diseases, coupled \nwith its inadequate fire safety practices, exposes youths detained there to great risks. \nCells are extremely dirty, contain tom mattresses, and the toilets in the cells were not \nadequately cleaned.  The showers were similarly filthy; such environmental considerations are \n\n- 15 -\ncritical in preventing the spread of infectious agents such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus \naureus (\"MRSA,,).5 \nLCJDC's fire safety and emergency planning is also inadequate and exposes both youth \nand staff to an unnecessarily high risk of harm, including death.  Documentation showed that \nalthough the facility conducts monthly fire drills, the facility's plan for evacuating youth and \nstaff is dangerous.  LCJDC's plan is to evacuate everyone to a small outdoor recreation area that \nis directly adjacent to the detention area and is enclosed with tall brick walls.  This would be \ndangerous in the event of a fire.  LCJDC also fails to have a plan for evacuation in the event of a \ntornado or other emergency. \n9. \t LCJDC violates the due process rights of youth by failing to provide a \ngrievance system. \nA grievance system provides detained youth with a mechanism to resolve disputes \nregarding their detention.  Given the arbitrary discipline process and the other deficiencies noted \nin this letter, the absence of a grievance process contributes to the unconstitutional conditions in . \nthe facility.  LCJDC does not provide any forms for filing grievances or any confidential means \nfor filing grievances, such as a locked drop box.  According to the facility manual, the grievance \nprocess consists of a juvenile writing a statement of his or her grievance and handing that \nstatement to the shift supervisor.  The shift supervisor then submits the statement to the assistant \ndirector, who then conveys it to the facility director.  There is nothing confidential about any  . \naspect of this process. \nYouth at LCJDC have a right to file grievances with the facility regarding their treatment, \nas well as a right not to be punished for using the grievance system. See Decker v. McDonald, \n*\nNo. 5:09 Civ. 27, 2010 WL 1424322,  15 (B.D.Tex. Jan. 11,2010) (noting that the law is well \nestablished that prison officials may not retaliate against an inmate who exercises his right of \naccess to the courts oruse of the grievance system); see also Hasan v. U.S. Dep't ofLabor, 400 \nF.3d 1001, 1005 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that, unless frivolous, prisoners' grievances are entitled \nto First Amendment protection). \nBasic due process and generally accepted professional standards for juvenile facilities \nrequire a grievance process that affords youth confidentiality, protects them from retaliation by \nstaff, is unimpeded, and offers a level of review for appeals.  At the time of our tour, the director \nofLCJDC had not received a grievance since October 2005 - a period of more than four years. \nThe fact that no grievances have been received by the director since October 2005 is testament to \n5  MRSA is a highly contagious bacteria commonly found in institutional settings that is resistant to certain \nantibiotics, including methicillin.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ar_mrsa_ca-'public.html.  The disease presents itself at fIrst as a boil or sore on the \nskin, and is easily spread through contact with an infected person or with a surface the person has touched.  Id.  In \nsome cases, MRSA can lead to serious complications, including surgical wound infections, bloodstream infections, \nand pneumonia.  Id. \n\n- 16 -\nthe inadequacy ofthe process.  We find that LCJDC's grievance process is a contribution factor \nto unconstitutional conditions. \nB. \t YOUTHS' RIGHTS TO ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ARE BEING \nVIOLATED AT LCJDC \nLCJDC consistently fails to provide youth with adequate general education services. \nAlthough the County has asserted that complying with the law is difficult due to the transient \nnature ofthe youth population and limited resources, these challenges are not unique to this \nfacility and do not excuse the County from providing proper educational services to detained \nyouth.  Specifically, Mississippi state law requires that youth receive a minimum offive hours of \neducational instruction each weekday during the academic year. Miss. Code Ann. § 37-13-91(d), ' \nas amended. \nThe denial of education services to detained youth that are comparable to those provided \nby the State to non-detained youth violates due process and equal protection rights.  Plyler v. \nDoe, 457 U.S. 202, 224 (1982) (deprivation ofbasic educational services must be rationally \nrelated to a substantial goal ofthe state); Donnell C. v. Illinois State Bd. ofEduc., 829 F. Supp. \n1016, 1018-19 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (a juvenile facility's denial ofeducation services and provision of \neducation services inferior to those of non-detained youth violated due process and equal \nprotection claims ofyouth at the facility).  In cases discussing the provision of education to \ndetained youth, courts have recognized the essential function ofeducation.  See, e.g., Morgan v. \nSproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130, 1150-51 (D. Miss. 1977) (holding that juvenile facility must provide \nsufficient education and vocational training to residents in order to reduce recidivism and \npromote successful reintegration into society). \nFurthermore, students with disabilities have federal statutory rights to special education \nservices under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-\n1482.  See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 310 (1988) (noting that the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, as amended by IDEA,· \"confers upon disabled students an \nenforceable substantive right to public education in participating States\").  IDEA requires states \nthat accept federal funds to provide educational services to all children with disabilities between \nthe ages ofthree and twenty-one years, even ifthe children have been suspended or expelled \nfrom school.  20 U.S.c. § 1412(a)(1)(A).  Accordingly, the State must provide such services to \nyouth in juvenile justice facilities.  See id. (conditioning funds on the availability of services to \n\"all children with disabilities\"); 34 C.F.R. § 300.2(b)(1)(iv) (applying IDEA requirements to \"all \npolitical subdivisions ofthe State that are involved in the education ofchildren with disabilities, \nincluding ... State and local juvenile and adult correctional facilities\"); see also Alexander S. By \nand Through Bowers v. Boyd, 876 F. SUpp. 773, 788 (D. S.C. 1995) (fmding IDEA applicable to \nschool-age detainees in juvenile detention facilities).  IDEA also requires schools to have \nprocedures for identifying and testing students with disabilities.  34 C.F.R. § 300.111 (a)(1)(i ). \nSection 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section 504\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794, similarly \nobligates the State to provide youth confined in its institutions with educational services.  Section \n504 requires that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as \n\n- 17 -\ndefined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded \nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \nAlthough the County is obligated to provide free and appropriate education to qualified \nstudents with disabilities under both the IDEA and Section 504, special education services are \nvirtually non-existent atLCJDC.  The facility does not appropriately collect and analyze \nacademic and behavioral data for students.  Because ofthis, students at LCJDC often do not \nreceive appropriate special education services as required by IDEA.  Specifically, LCJDC is \nnoncompliant with IDEA with respect to:  1) Child Find (see infra, below); 2) general education \ninterventions; 3) Individual Education Programs (\"IEPs\"); 4) access to the general education \ncurriculum for students receiving special education services; 5) behavioral supports; 6) staffing; \nand 7) transition services. \n1. \t LCJDC violates the due process and equal protection rights of youth \nconfined there by failing to provide them with appropriate general \neducational services. \nYouth at LCJDC do not receive adequate educational services during detention, in \nviolation of their equal protection and due process rights.  Under State law, youths are entitled to \na minimum offive hours ofeducational instruction each weekday during the academic year, \nMiss. Code Ann. § 37-13-91(d), as amended.  Students at LCJDC reported receiving \ninstructional class only Monday through Wednesday until the week ofour November 2009 tour. \nBeginning with the week of our tour, students and staff stated that instruction occurs Monday \nthrough Thursday, with Friday reserved for television or movies.  Youth detained at LCJDC are \nnot receiving educational services consistent with the State's mandatory minimum of 5 hours \neach weekday. \nLCJDC fails to maintain any educational records and coursework does not align with that \nrequired for a student in the community to obtain a high school diploma.  During classroom \nobservation, one female student in her mid-teens was seen completing a worksheet reviewing \nelementary addition (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5).  Such instruction does not allow students to access grade-\nlevel curriculum available to non-detained youth.  Additional inadequacies of LCJDC's general \neducational services are mentioned throughout the discussion of special educational services \nbelow. \n2. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide adequate Child Find \nprocedures. \nIDEA requires that the State have in effect policies and procedures to identify, locate, and \nevaluate youth suspected ofhaving a qualifying disability that would entitle them to special \neducation services.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.111(a)(1)(i).  This is known as \"Child Find.:'  Child Find \ncan sometimes be as simple as asking a detained youth whether he or she has ever received \nspecial education services at the community school. \n\n-----=-~--.----\n- 18 -\nAlthough a structured intake assessment form exists at LCJDC, Child Find is \nsignificantly limited by inadequate or non-existent assessments and faulty scoring.  LCJDC's \nintake forms do not capture data regarding special education status or history.  Rather, the basic \nscreening forms are limited to evaluating the educational and vocational status of youths.  In our \nindividual interviews, we identified two youths, A.E. and A.F., who had previously received \nspecial education services elsewhere but had not been identified by LCJDC as possibly having a \ndisability entitling them to special education services.  LCJDC's intake forms do not capture data \nregarding special education status or history necessary for Child Find. \nEven if an assessment form utilizes popular evaluative tools, such as the Massachusetts \nYouth Screening Instrument Version 2 (\"MAYSI-2\") used by LCJDC, such tools are only \neffective for Child Find ifproperly analyzed and disseminated in a timely fashion.  The current \nevaluative tools fail to satisfy these criteria.  Basic scoring of intake assessments is not properly \ncompleted, and data is not used to properly guide instructional accommodations.  After a student \ncompletes a basic screening, LCJDC scores the assessments using percentages and not grade \nlevel.  However, given the nature and purpose ofthese forms, reporting the assessment as a \npercentage score is ineffective in guiding the teacher towards determining whether special \neducation modifications are necessary.  Moreover, score forms based on the assessments are only \ncompleted when a student is exiting the facility.  Accordingly, even ifthe assessments were \nscored in a manner that would allow the teacher to make proper adjustments to a youth's \ncurriculum or to evaluate a youth for special education services, the data would be unavailable \nfor this purpose until the student has left the facility.  LCmC's intake and screening procedures, \ntherefore, inadequately assist in identifying students in need of special education and related \nservices. \n3. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide general instructional and \nevaluative interventions. \nPrior to evaluation ofa student for special education, IDEA requires that the State review \ndata-based documentation ofthe student's progress and consider whether the student is being \nprovided appropriate instruction by a highly qualified teacher.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.309(b)(1)-(2). \nThe State must further document the student's behavior in that student's learning environment, \nincluding the regular classroom setting. \nThere is no evidence that LCJDC engages in academic or behavioral pre-referral/general \neducation interventions, data collection, or observations.  Both academic and behavioral pre-\nreferral/general education interventions should include specific methods for data collection in \norder to objectively evaluate student progress and the possible need for special education \nservices.  LCJDC's data collection processes are inadequate.  This incomplete data is \nparticularly troubling for students at the warning level for suicidal ideation, traumatic \nexperiences, or anger.  These youths may be entitled to special education services, but they are \nnot being identified at LCJDC.  During our tour, 6 ofthe 13 youths tested at the warning level on \nthe facility's tests but were not receiving any special education services. \n\n- 19 -\n4. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide Individualized Education \nPrograms for youth in need of special education services. \nIDEA requires that each student with a disability have an Individualized Education \nProgram (\"IEP\") to ensure that the student receives adequate special education services.  34 \nC.F.R. 71 § 300.323(a).  No IEPs were available during our tour, and although several IEPs were \nprovided post-tour, none were for students present at the facility during our visit.  During our \ntour, we discovered a student with special needs who had been housed at LCJDC for 36 days \nwith no :rEP.  This is a violation ofIDEA. \nIDEA also requires that LCJDC take reasonable steps to promptly obtain a youth's \nrecords, including :rEPs or documents relating to. a youth's special education status, from the \nprevious public agency in which the child was enrolled.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.323(g)(1).  LCJDC \nwas unable to produce educational records for any student enrolled at the time ofour tour, and \nstaff stated that :rEPs are often received after a youth has already left the facility.  No data \nconcerning student academic and behavioral :rEP goals was available while on site, nor was there \nany indication that parents/guardians and:rEP team members had met regarding any student.  The \nabsence ofthis data is a gross violation ofIDEA. \nIn addition, IDEA requires that teachers implement each child's IEP, including specific \naccommodations, modifications, and supports.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.323(c)(2).  No instructional \nadaptations were observed at LCJDC nor were any adaptations listed on lesson plans.  Moreover, \nlesson plans were incomplete, there was no evidence of academic or behavioral-related record \nkeeping, and lesson plans did not differentiate assignments for students at various levels.  The \ninadequacy of lesson plans and instructional adaptations may be partly attributed to the failure to \nprovide the teacher with IEPs until after a youth has left the facility.  Without an IEP, it is \nimpossibl~ for the teacher to properly instruct students according to their individual needs as is \nrequired under IDEA. \nLCJDC's failure to maintain :rEPs violates several federal requirements, notably that: \n1) adequate records are not obtained at intake or sent out at exit from LCJDC; 2) :rEPs are not \ndeveloped, reviewed, or reevaluated in accordance with federal law; 3) there is a high risk of \ninconsistencies between previous and current levels of special education service for youths; \n4) there is a lack ofparent/guardian and:rEP team signatures; 5) there is a lack ofIEP \nimplementation and data collection; and 6) there is a possible lack ofrelationship between the \ndisability of an individual youth and the:rEP goals.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.320(a)(2)(i-ii). \n5. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide access to the general \neducation curriculum for youth in need of special education services. \nLCJDC's common practice of segregating youths for discipline problems during school· \nfails to comply with IDEA's requirement that LCJDC provide comprehensive educational \nservices to students.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.304(b)(1).  Specifically, no education services are \navailable to students who are sent to their cells for discipline problems.  When a student \nmisbehaves, LCJDC routinely returns the youth to hislher cell for the remainder ofthe day with \n\n-20-\nno school work, even when the youth's behavior has improved.  This is a patent violation of \nIDEA.  During our tour, 13-year-old youth A.H. was in his cell without any schoolwork for the \nentire school day because he had refused to do schoolwork in the classroom.  Our interview with \nR.S. revealed a calm and compliant youth who should have been returned to the classroom. \nPursuant to federal law, educational services should be comprehensive so as to enable youths to \ncontinue to participate in the general education curriculum even ifthey must be temporarily \nsegregated.  Where safety or other penalogical interests are involved, LCJDC should make \nindividualized adaptations and return the student to class as quickly as safely possible. \n6. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide adequate behavioral \nsupports for youth. \nLCJDC fails to provide positive behavioral interventions, supports and other strategies to \naddress negative behavior, as required by IDEA.  34 C.F.R. 71. § 300.324(a)(2)(i).  Positive \nbehavioral interventions and supports include interventions for youth at the facility level, \nsecondary interventions for youth with additional needs, and tertiary interventions for youth who \nrequire individualized behavioral interventions. \nAlthough LCJDC employs a school-wide social skills curriculum, the primary approach \nto behavioral problems is reactive.  As noted above, LCJDC inappropriately segregates students \nin cells for the remainder ofthe school day rather than correcting problematic behavior in the \nclassroom.  Segregation is inconsistent with IDEA, and there is no evidence that a youth's \ndisability is considered when students are sent back to their cells or in the administration of \nconsequences for behavioral misconduct.  During our tour, we observed an announcement \nstating:  \"Any juvenile found to be disruptive to the orderly running ofthis facility will be \nrecommended to 90 days detention or training school.\"  Such reactive and sporadic disciplinary \nmeasures fail to adequately remedy or deter problematic behavior and are particularly \ninappropriate for youth with disabilities.  Two out of seven students we interviewed regarding \neducation reported that no reinforcement was provided as an incentive for positive behavior. \nMoreover, no rules or consequences were posted in the classroom as guidelines for behavior. \nPerhaps the most egregious concern regarding LCJDC's use of segregation is the failure \nto maintain any data regarding youth segregation;  No data is available regarding length oftime \nor frequency of segregation; reason for segregation; youth behavior while segregated; or  \"\"-\nguidelines for use of segregation.  Without such data, \"manifestation determination\" hearings \ncannot occur.6  Further, failing to chronicle segregation use prevents development of, and \nimplementation of, modifications to general education interventions and behavior intervention \nplans (\"HIPs\").  IDEA requires that LCJDC conduct a manifest determination when it decides to \nchange the placement of a student with disabilities because ofthat student's violation ofthe code \n6  Manifestation determination hearings are employed when a student who receives special education services \nis considered for suspension, expulsion or any alternative placement due to some behavioral concern.  The process is \nused to determine ifthe actions that resulted in the consideration ofsome disciplinary action against the student \nwere manifestations ofthe student's disability. \n\n- 21 -\nof conduct.  LCJDC's failure to log this data regarding youth segregation is a patent violation of \nIDEA. \nBased on our review ofteacher reports, it appears that students who missed up to two \ndays of school per week were allowed to watch movies on Fridays as incentive for positive \nbehavior.  This reward system is problematic because it disengages students from instruction \nduring the movies and permits an excessive number of absences.  LCJDC's system to address \nstudent behavior is ineffective and places youth with disabilities at a significant disadvantage for \nmaintaining access to the general education curriculum.  More specific behavioral \nreinforcements should be implemented throughout each day as part of a facility behavior \nmanagement program. \nTo adequately address student behavior, LCJDC should implement secondary behavioral \ninterventions for youth who do not need individual programs but need support beyond the \nfacility plan.  Under IDEA, when a youth's \"behavior impedes the child's learning or that of \nothers, consider the use ofpositive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to \naddress that behavior,\" 34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.324(a)(2)(i).  An effective behavioral intervention \nplan is an intervention that is designed to promote positive, pro-social student behavior. \nPursuant to IDEA, behavior that is a manifestation of a disability should result in a \nfunctional behavior assessment and the development or modification ofthe current behavior \nintervention plan.  Teachers and staff should be held accountable for consistently and accurately \nevaluating student behavior, recording data, and using student behavioral data, as per \nindividualized programs.  At LCJDC, no evidence of any functional behavior assessment or \nindividual behavior plans exists.  Further, it is not apparent that teachers and staff are held \naccountable for consistently and accurately evaluating student behavior, recording data, and. \nusing student behavioral data. \n7. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide adequate educational \nstaffing for youth in need of special education services. \nAlthough the student-teacher ratio at the time of our tour ofLCJDC was acceptable at 13 \nstudents per 1 teacher, the current teacher is neither appropriately licensed nor qualified, in \nviolation of IDEA.  Additional teachers who are licensed and qualified are needed to meet the \nrequirements set forth in IDEA.  A staffing plan should be devised and implemented based on \nthese current needs, and in light of federal requirements. \n8. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide adequate transition services \nfor youth in need of special education services. \nAlthough IDEA requires that facilities provide transitional services, none exist at LCJDC. \nIDEA includes two major components in its definition ofthe group of activities labeled as \n\"transition services.\" First, transition services should be located within a results-oriented process \nfocused on preparing students for a fruitful life outside ofthe school context.  Second, the \n\n- 22-\ntransition services that a given student receives should be based on the individualized needs of \nthat student. \nVocational technology courses may help provide transitional services for youths.  We \nreviewed a LCJDC memorandum about a vocational technology program that was supposedly \nimplemented in Fall 2009.  The curricula listed classes in auto mechanics and repair, brick \nmasonry, wood shop, refrigeration and air conditioning, culinary instructions, cosmetology, and \ncomputer technology.  In re8;lity, however, no vocational education courses exist at the facility. \nIfthe facility had vocational programs, they would need to be offered in accordance with \ntransition services outlined in a student's IEP.  Since there were no IEPs available, it is unclear \nwhether some students have vocational education listed on their IEPs. \nAn additional concern regarding transition services is the lack of comprehensive and \nformal information concerning academic progress, which is necessary to report back to a \nstudent's home school upon exiting the facility.  Although general transition procedures were \nprovided, the lack of appropriate education and special education services, as well as academic \nand behavioral data, makes communication of youth progress impossible except for very general \nstatements. \nV.REMEDIAL MEASURES \nIn order to rectify the identified deficiencies and protect the constitutional and federal \nstatutory rights ofyouth confined at Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center, the County \nshould implement the minimal remedial measures set forth below.  Implementation of the \nmeasures should comply with generally accepted professional standards in order to ensure that \nyouths are adequately treated, protected from harm, and provided with appropriate educational \nservices. \nA.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \n1.  Restraints \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that restraints never be used to punish \nyouth.  Every application of mechanical restraints or use of force - including handcuffs, leg \nshackles, belly chains, or other such restraints - should be fully documented, including the \ncircumstances leading to the application, efforts used to de-escalate the situation, the specific \nmanner or technique in which force was applied, and the duration ofthe incident.  The current \nfacility practice of restraining residents to the bed should be immediately stopped.  Ally \nrestrained juvenile should be constantly observed by staffto ensure safety. \nLCJDC should develop and implement written policies and procedures that establish a \ngraduated set ofinterventions that avoid the use ofphysical force or mechanical restraints. \nGenerally accepted practices for juvenile justice facilities require that physical force be used by \nstaffonly in exceptional circumstances when all other pro-active, non-physical behavior \nmanagement techniques have been Unsuccessful and the youth presents a danger to himself or \n\n......... _. ____ .. ___. -e=== \n---\n-23 -\nothers.  In the limited circumstances when physical force is appropriate, staff should employ only \nthe minimum amount necessary to stabilize the situation and protect the safety ofthe involved \njuvenile or others.  Therefore, detention staffshould be trained in non-physical, verbal \ninterventions to de-escalate potential aggression from youth. \nYouth who hav'e been subject to force or mechanical restraints should be assessed by a \nmedical professional following the incident regardless ofwhether there is a visible injury or the \nyouth denies any injury.  Subsequently, management should conduct a formal review ofthe \nincident to determine whether staff acted appropriately.  The post-incident review should also be \nutilized to identify any training needs and debrief staff on how to avoid similar incidents through \nde:.escalation. \n2.  Disciplinary Due Process \nYouth detained at juvenile justice facilities have a right to due process protections in the \nevent that they are subjected to discipline or punishment.  LCJDC should establish a disciplinary \nsystem, including notification to all youth ofthe facility rules, the consequences for violating \nthose rules, and their rights ifthey are charged with a rule violation.  Youth should receive \ninstruction on the facility rules and the disciplinary process during orientation.  This information \nshould also be provided in a facility handbook provided to each youth during orientation and \nshould be displayed in the youths' living and program areas.  If a youth is charged with a \nviolation, minimally adequate due process protections should include:  1) the provision ofwritten' \nnotice ofthe alleged violation to the detainee/youth/resident at least 24 hours prior to a hearing; \n2) a written statement by the fact-finder(s) as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the \ndisciplinary action taken; and, 3) unless it interferes with institutional safety, the youth should \nhave the opportunity to present witnesses and evidence at the hearing. \nAdministrative and disciplinary segregation should be used appropriately. \nAdministrative segregation should only be used as an emergency measure to control a youth \nwhose behavior poses an immediate risk ofharm to himself or others or who requires protective \ncustody, either at the youth's request or the facility's assessment.  Youths who are placed in \nadministrative segregation for behavioral reasons should be removed from segregation as soon as \ntheir behavior no longer poses an immediate risk ofharm to themselves or others.  Youths placed \nin administrative segregation for behavioral reasons should also be provided with a due process \nhearing every 24 hours any time their segregation exceeds 24 hours.  Disciplinary segregation \nshould only be used as a sanction for a major rule violation, and each youth should receive a due \nprocess hearing prior to being sent to disciplinary segregation.  No youth should be placed in \nsegregation for longer than three consecutive days except for protective custody purposes. \n3.  Reporting & Investigating Abuse \nLCJDC should adopt and implement a zero-tolerance policy for staff abuse ofyouths, and \nstaff should be consistently held accoUntable when policy violations occur.  Serious incidents, \nallegations ofabuse, and allegations of staff misconduct should be adequately and timely \ninvestigated by neutral investigators with no involvement or interest in the underlying event. \n\n---\n-24-\nStaff conducting these investigations should receive adequate competency-based training on the \ninvestigation process, which should be completed in a timely fashion and no later than 30 days \nafter an incident or allegation.  In the rare cases where an exception to this time frame is \nwarranted, the exception should be documented and not granted on the basis ofinadequate \ninvestigator staffing.  LCIDC should also develop and implement a written process to report \nresident's allegations of staff abuse to the State as mandated reporters. \n4.  Classification \nLCJDC should develop a written classification policy that takes into account: \n1) separation ofolder residents from younger residents; 2) separation ofmales from females; \n3) separation ofviolent from non-violent youth; 4) maturity; 5) presence ofmental or physical \ndisabilities; 6) suicide risk; 7) offense; and 8) case-specific information about youth who should \nbe separated from each other.  The policy should address plans to protect youth who have been \nvictimized at the facility or who have concerns about their safety. \n5.  Medical and Mental Health Care \na.  Screenings and Treatment \nIn order to comply with generally accepted professional standards to provide adequate \nhealth care services to youths in need ofmedical and mental health care attention, LCIDC should \nprovide adequate, comprehensive, and reliable screening and assessment services to identify \nyouths with serious medical and mental health needs, both at intake and throughout the youths' \n. time at LCJDC.  All youth should undergo a health screenmg within one hour of admission to \nLCJDC, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, in order to obtain accurate information \nabout the youth's medical and mental health.  Screenings should include information about, \nphysical health, suicide risk, alcohol and other drug use and abuse, aggressive behavior, family \nrelations, peer relations, social skills, educational status, and vocational status.  Corrections staff \nwho conduct screenings should be trained by a health authority.  Youth requiring routine, urgent, \nor emergency care should receive timely referrals to qualified health professionals. \nA qualified mental health professional should complete an initial mental health  \nassessment form that summarizes the youth's prior mental health history and includes a current  \nmental status examination, suicide risk inquiry, provisional diagnosis, and treatment plan, if  \napplicable.  Youths should be referred for mental health services where such services are  \nindicated as a result ofthe mental health screening and assessment process, or where a youth  \ndemonstrates symptoms ofmental illness that significantly interfere with his or her ability to  \ncomplete the facility's treatment program.  Mental health assessments should be adequately  \ndocumented and, where indicated, should begin during the youth's time in the intake unit and  \ninclude:  pursuit and review ofprior behavioral health records; contact with the youth's family;  \nconsultation with facility staff; interviews with the youth; and, where indicated, specialized  \ntesting and medical consultation.  Medical and mental health staffmg should be sufficient to  \nprovide adequate medical and mental health care services to all youths requiring such services.  \n\n------~--~--=-==-== ---=~=~~~ \n- 25 -\nLCJDC should establish and maintain adequate, formal, individualized treatment \nplanning that articulates specific planned behavioral interventions.  At a minimum, interventions \nshould consist ofregularly scheduled individual counseling.  LCIDC should attempt to involve \nfamilies in the treatment planning process, and treatment plans should be periodically reviewed \nand revised as appropriate.  Treatment plans for youths who are prescribed psychotropic \nmedications should specify the medication, its target symptoms, and the basis for using it. \nQualified mental health professionals should provide and adequately document individual \ncounseling for youths who require counseling.  Documentation of counseling sessions should \ninclude clinical data regarding the youth's subjective expressions or mental status, problems \naddressed and the means of addressing them, the clinician's impressions ofthe youth's progress, \nand any plan for continuing treatment.  LCJDC should also establish and maintain adequate \ntransition planning.  At a minimum, mental health staff should provide a written summary ofthe \nyouth's mental health treatment, his response to treatment, and a recommendation regarding \nfurther care. \nThe provision of adequate medication management should ensure that:  1) a prescribing \nprofessional performs and adequately documents an assessment supporting the prescription; \n2) the prescribing professional adequately monitors youths on psychiatric medications by \nconducting and adequately documenting medication monitoring visits at least monthly, or more \nfrequently as indicated; and 3) appropriate consent is obtained prior to starting a youth on a \nmedication. \nh.  Suicide Prevention and Related Mental Health Care \nIn order to comply with generally accepted professional standards to provide adequate \nservices to potentially suicidal youths and take appropriate action to prevent youths from \nengaging in self-injurious behavior, including suicide, the County should establish a \ncomprehensive suicide prevention program.  All staff members who interact with youths should \nreceive at least eight hours of initial, competency-based suicide prevention training and two \nhours of annual competency-based training thereafter.  The initial training should cover the \nfollowing topics:  1) avoiding obstacles to suicide prevention, juvenile suicide research; 2) why \nfacility environments are conducive to suicidal behavior; 3) warning signs and symptoms of \nsuicide; and 4) components ofthe agency's suicide prevention program.  The annual training \nshould review any changes in the facility's suicide prevention policy and update staff on any \nserious suicides and/or attempts, not simply repeat initial training. \nLCJDC should ensure ongoing identification of suicide risk for youths.  Immediately \nupon their arrival at the facility, newly admitted youths should receive adequate intake screening \nfor suicide risk before leaving the intake area.  Any staff member should be able to place a youth \non suicide precautions.  All potentially suicidal youths should be placed on suicide precautions \nunless a qualified mental health professional determines, following a face-to-face evaluation, that \nthe youth is not suicidal.  Youth who are admitted to segregation should receive a written \nassessment of suicide risk by mental health staff or by medical staff ifmental health staff \nmembers are unavailable.  LCJDC should ensure adequate communication among staff regarding \nyouths' potential suicidality.  Correctional, medical, and mental health staff should participate in \n\n-26-\ntreatment team meetings, and all staff should understand facility policies regarding \ncommunication. \nPotentially suicidal youths· should be placed in rooms that are free of suicide hazards, \nincluding protrusions and tying offpoints, and should not be placed in isolation.  Removal of \nyouths' clothing, other than belts and shoelaces, use ofrestraints, and suspension of routine \nprivileges such as visits, phone calls, and recreation, may only be employed by a qualified \nmental health professional as a last resort if a suicidal youth is engaging iIi self-destructive \nbehavior.  LCJDC should maintain sufficient staffing levels to supervise youths who require \nconstant observation. \nYouths who are removed from suicide precautions should receive regular follow-up \nassessments by mental health staff, including individualized treatment plans for suicidal youths \nthat address relapse prevention and initiate a risk management plan.  The risk management plan \nshould describe:  the likely signs, symptoms, and circumstances for a recurrence ofsuicide risk, \nprevention of suicidal thoughts, and actions the youth or staff can take in response to the \nrecurrence of suicidal thoughts. \nAdequate mortality-morbidity reviews should be conducted, separate from any other \nnecessary formal investigations, after a completed suicide or a serious suicide attempt.  The \nreviews should include:  1) review ofthe circumstances surrounding the incident; 2) review of \nprocedures relevant to the incident; 3) review of all relevant training provided to involved staff; \n4) review ofpertinent medical and mental health services/reports involving the youth victim;  5) \nreview of any possible precipitating factors that may have caused the youth to attempt or commit \nsuicide; and 6) recommendations, if any, for changes in policy, training, physical plant, medical \nor mental health services, and operational procedures.  The mortality-morbidity review team \nshould be multidisciplinary and include management and line staff from the direct care, medical, \nand mental health areas.  The reviews should focus on the incident and what the facility can learn \nto prevent future incidents.  . \nFurthermore, LCJDC should develop an adequate plan for intervening in suicide \nattempts, including ensuring that staff members notify emergency medical personnel \nimmediately after the discovery of a life-threatening emergency; ensuring that all housing units \ncontain adequate emergency equipment, including rescue tools; and ensuring annual mock drills \nfor suicide attempts and annual competency-based instruction in the use of emergency equipment \nfor staff.  The facility should also establish and maintain an adequate quality assurance program \nto measure compliance with the facility's suicide prevention program, including the remedial \nmeasures outlined above. \n6.  Programming \nLCJDC should ensure the availability of adequate rehabilitative programming, including, \nbut not limited to, education, counseling, and mental health services.  LCJDC should provide for \nevening and weekend programs and activities that allow youth to engage in meaningful \nactivities.  In addition, LCJDC should develop and implement a behavior management system \n\n-27-\nthat outlines prohibited behaviors (major and minor) and the sanctions or consequences for these \nbehaviors.  Written policies and procedures should allow youth at least one hour of large muscle \nexercise daily. \n7.  Staffing and Supervision \nLCJDC should ensure that staffing and supervision levels are appropriate to adequately \nsupervise all youths.  The staffing pattern should consider the structural design ofthe LGJDC, \nthe need to monitor residents on suicide watch, and other day-to-day operations.  For youths who \nare locked in their cells, staff should make and document visual checks ofthe youths at random \nintervals at least every 15 minutes with youths sufficiently visible to permit staffto verify their \nwell-being.  Documentation of monitoring should be accurate and contemporaneous. \nLCJDC should develop and implement appropriate training forstaff.  Newly hired staff should \nreceive the requisite hours of competency-based training and all staff should receive appropriate \nadditional hours of annual training after the first year of employment.  All such trainings should \ninclude, but should not be limited to, training in use of force, including safe crisis management \nand de-escalation techniques; training specific to the supervision of youths, including training on \nadolescent development; and training in identifying and responding to fights, assaults, and sexual \nactivity. \n8.  Environmental Safety \nLCJDC should develop written housekeeping and emergency preparedness plans to \nensure that youth are provided reasonable conditions of care and safety.  The housekeeping plan \nshould address daily cleanliness and sanitation issues.  Linens, mattresses and clothing should be \nroutinely inspected and replaced as needed.  Written policies and procedures should also be \ndeveloped to address facility readiness for fires and other emergencies, including modifying the \ncurrent evacuation plan to ensure safe egress during emergencies. \n9.  Grievance System \nYouths should have an effective and reliable process to raise grievances.  The process \nshould protect youth from possible retribution by staff.  A grievance coordinator should track, \ncategorize, and tabulate all grievances, which should be reviewed and addressed in a timely· \nmanner within five days ofreceipt.  Youths should be provided with notification ofthe final \nresolution of their grievances, and bureaucratic responses to grievances should be prohibited. \nGrievance forms should be freely accessible in all areas frequented by youths, and youths should \nhave access to a grievance box from which grievances are retrieved daily. \n\n- 28-\nB.  EDUCATION \n1.  General Education \nIn order to comply with federal constitutional and state statutory requirements for \nproviding adequate general education services to youths, the County should provide youth in \ndisciplinary confinement with the full range of educational services, provide all youth reasonable \naccess to reading and writing materials in their cells, and ensure youths at LCJDC receive the \nsame type and number of daily and weekly instructional minutes as other youths in the State's \nschools. \n2.  Child Find Procedures \nIn order to comply with federal statutory requirements for providing adequate special \neducation services to youths with disabilities, the County should provide adequate screening of \nyouth for special education needs.  This includes obtaining prior education records from school \nsystems in a timely fashion.  Special education services should be provided to all youth with \ndisabilities who are in need of special education and related services after they are identified, \nlocated, and evaluated in accordance with Child Find.  Youths should be asked about previously \noffered special education during intake, and LCJDC should ensure documentation of academic \ninterventions for youths who are struggling. \n3.  General Instructional and Evaluative Interventions \nLCJDC should develop, implement, and maintain adequate pre-referral and general \neducation interventions.  LCJDC should also collect and maintain comprehensive educational \nrecords for all youth at the facility.  Prior t6 evaluating a youth for special education, LCJDC \nshould determine whether the youth is being provided appropriate instruction by a highly \nqualified teacher and review data-based documentation of the youth's progress, including \nadequate documentation ofthe youth's behavior in his learning environment and regular \nclassroom setting. \n4.  Individualized Education Programs \nPursuant to IDEA, LCJDC should develop, implement, and maintain an adequate IEP for \neach youth who qualifies for an IEP and provide necessary related services.  IEPs should be \nupdated and/or completed as quickly as possible upon intake and reviewed at least annually. \nServices provided to youths with IEPs should be comparable to those described in the youth's \nIEP from his previous agency in the absence of adequate justification for changes in services. \nParents and/or guardians should be included in IEP meetings to the extent possible.  IEPs should \nbe adequately implemented and include collection and reporting of data on youth progress and \nindividual accommodations. \n\n- 29-\n5. \t Access to General Education Curriculum for Youth in Need of Special \nEducation Services \nIn order to ensure that youths with disabilities have sufficient access to special education \nservices, LCJDC should provide that:  1) youths are enrolled in school within two days ofintake; \n2) youths are provided with access to the general education curriculum; 3) youths with, and at \nrisk for, disabilities are provided with adequate direct instruction using research-based \ninstructional approaches; 4) youths with disabilities receive not less than five hours ofinstruction \ndaily, the same number of daily and weekly instructional minutes as other youths in the State's \nschools; 5) youths with disabilities are provided appropriate instructional adaptations; and 6) \nadequate attendance records are maintained. \n6. \t Behavioral Supports \nYouths with disabilities should also receive adequate behavioral supports through a \nsystemic behavior plan that does not permit the use ofsegregation and exclusionary settings. \nManifestation determination hearings should occur for youths with disabilities who are removed \nor segregated from their stated appropriate educational setting for disciplinary, administrative, or \nother reasons, in excess often days or in a pattern of removals.  Secondary interventions should \nbe implemented for youths who do not need individual behavior programs but need behavioral \nsupports beyond those offered in the facility plan. \n7. \t Staffing \nLCJDC should provide adequate special education staffing by developing, \nimplementing, and maintaining an education staffing plan and ensuring an adequate number of \nlicensed and highly qualified teachers, as well as qualified substitute teachers, to provide \ninstruction in all necessary courses. \n8. \t Transition Services \nResults-oriented, individualized, coordinated transition services should be provided for \nyouths with disabilities who are 16 years old or older to facilitate the youths' movement from \nschool to post-school activities. \n* * * * * \nPlease note that this findings letter is a public document.

Leflore  County  Juvenile  Detention  Center  (“LCJDC”  or  “the \nFacility”) is an integral part of the public safety system in Leflore County, Mississippi \n(“Leflore County”).  Through the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties seek to ensure \nthat the conditions in the Facility respect the rights of Youth confined there, encourage  \nrehabilitation and improve the likelihood that Youth will succeed upon release.  By \nensuring  that  the  conditions  in  LCJDC  are  in  compliance  with  the  applicable \nrequirements of the United States Constitution, Leflore County will also provide for the \nsafety of staff and promote public safety in the community. \n2. \t  On March 31, 2011, the United States issued an investigative findings letter (“Findings \nLetter”) pursuant to the Civil Rights of  Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 \nU.S.C. §1997, and the pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. §14141 (“Section 14141”).  The Findings Letter \nconcluded  that  certain  conditions  at  LCJDC  violated  the  constitutional  and  federal \nstatutory rights of Youth housed there. The Findings Letter is attached. \n3. \t  The parties to this Agreement are the United States, represented by the Department of \nJustice  (“DOJ”),  and  Leflore  County,  represented  by  the  Leflore  County  Board  of \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 2 of 29 PageID #: 52 \nSupervisors and each of their respective agents, employees, designees, and successors in  \noffice  (consistent  with  Miss.  Code  Ann.  §§ 19-3-40  and  25-1-47),  in  their  official \ncapacities (collectively, “Parties”).  The Parties expressly agree that the director of the \nLCJDC shall report directly to the Leflore County Board of Supervisors. \n4.\t   This Agreement is entered into between the Parties to address conditions of confinement  \nat  the  Facility.  This  Agreement  shall  be  filed  in  the  United  States  District  Court, \nNorthern District of Mississippi. \n5.\t   This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 28 U.S.C. § \n1345; and 42 U.S.C. §14141.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§1391(b). \n6.\t   Leflore  County  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  LCJDC  takes  all  necessary  and \nappropriate actions to comply with all provisions contained in this Agreement which are  \nthe responsibility of LCJDC.  Leflore County is responsible for providing or obtaining all \nsupport,  including  financial  resources,  necessary  to  fulfill  its  obligations  under  this \nAgreement, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require Leflore \nCounty to continue to operate the LCJDC or otherwise comply with this Agreement after \ntermination of this Agreement as provided in Section 111. \n7.\t   The United States agrees that this Agreement resolves the Section 14141 and CRIPA \ninvestigation concerning security and facility conditions  conducted by the DOJ, addresses \nthe corrective measures concerning security and facility conditions set forth by the DOJ \nin its Findings Letter, and represents an adequate voluntary effort by Leflore County to \naddress the alleged constitutional violations described in the Findings Letter.  See 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1997b(a)(2)(B) & 1997g.  Through the provisions of this Agreement, the \nParties seek to ensure that the security and facility conditions at LCJDC comply with the \nrights of Youth confined there, and are consistent with generally accepted juvenile justice  \nstandards.  This  Agreement  does  not  address  the  United  States’  findings  regarding  \neducation services at the LCJDC school and does not require action with respect to such \neducation services except as described in Paragraph 93 of this Agreement. \n8.\t   For purposes of this civil action only, and in order to settle this matter, the Parties  \nstipulate that this Agreement complies in all respects with the provisions of the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a), and may serve as the factual and legal basis  \nof a Court order issued under those provisions.  This stipulation and Agreement is limited \nto the instant civil action and does not apply to any other lawsuit brought by past, current \nor future juveniles with respect to LCJDF.  No person or entity is intended to or shall be a  \nthird-party beneficiary of the provisions of this Agreement for purposes of any civil, \ncriminal, or administrative action, and accordingly, no person or entity may assert any \nclaim or right as a beneficiary or protected class under this Agreement.  This Agreement \nis not intended to impair or expand the right of any person or organization to seek relief \nagainst  Leflore  County,  its  employees,  or  agents  for  their  past  or  future  conduct; \naccordingly,  this  Agreement  does  not  alter  any  legal  standards  governing  any  such \nclaims, including those under any federal or Mississippi law. \n2 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 3 of 29 PageID #: 53 \n9. \t  The Court finds, without a full hearing on the merits, on the basis of the United States’ \nComplaint and the attached Findings Letter,  that all of the prospective relief in this \nAgreement is narrowly drawn and extends no further than is necessary to correct the  \nviolations of the federal rights concerning security and facility conditions as described in \nthe attached Findings Letter and incorporated into this Agreement.  The provisions of this \nAgreement are the least intrusive means necessary to correct the findings of violations of \nthe federal rights concerning security and facility conditions at LCJDC. \n10. \t  This  Agreement,  and  attached  Findings  Letter,  shall  constitute  the  entire  integrated  \nagreement of the Parties.  No prior contemporaneous communications, oral or written, or  \nprior drafts shall be relevant or admissible for purposes of determining the meaning of \nany provisions here in this litigation or in any other proceeding. \n11. \t  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Leflore County from modifying or closing \nLCJDC at any time consistent with Paragraph 111(e) of this Agreement. \nDEFINITIONS  \n12. \t  “DOJ”  or  “United  States”  means  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice,  which \nrepresents the United States in this matter.  \n13. \t  “Effective Date” means the date the Agreement is signed by the Court.  \n14. \t  “Isolation” means confining a Youth in a room by himself or herself in any area of \nLCJDC for current and disruptive behavior that is dangerous to the Youth or others. \n15. \t  “LCJDC”  or  the  “Facility”  means  the  Leflore  County  Juvenile  Detention  Center, \ncurrently located on 307 West Market Street, Greenwood, MS 38930-4330, as well as \nany facility that is built, leased, or otherwise used to replace or supplement LCJDC. \n16. \t  “Qualified  Medical  Professional”  means  a  licensed  physician,  licensed  physician \nassistant, licensed nurse practitioner, or a registered nurse who is, at the relevant time,  \ncurrently licensed by the State of Mississippi to deliver those health  care services he or \nshe has undertaken to provide. \n17. \t  “Qualified Mental Health Professional” or “QMHP” means an individual who, at the \nrelevant time, has a minimum of a masters-level education and training in psychiatry, \npsychology,  counseling,  social  work  or  psychiatric  nursing  and  who  has  either  a \nMississippi professional license or a Mississippi Department of Mental Health credential \nas a mental health therapist.  \n18.\t   “Restraint” means the use of mechanical restraints (e.g., handcuffs, belly chains, leg \nshackles)  to  protect  a  Youth  from  harming  himself,  herself  or  others.

Under the classification and housing practices described below, the facility will \nproperly consider such factors as the Youth’s charge offense, history of violence and escape, \nvulnerability to victimization, gang membership or affiliation, health and mental health concerns,  \nand institutional history. \n34.\t   Housing and Supervision.  Within twenty-four (24) hours of admission to the Facility, \nall Youth shall be classified and housed in accordance with this Agreement and LCJDC’s  \nrevised policies and procedures. \n35. \t  Performance Measure. On the final day of each month that is not a Saturday, Sunday or \na legal holiday, the Facility director shall review all classifications and provide feedback \nto Staff to ensure that: all Youth are classified within twenty-four (24) hours of arrival to \nthe Facility; all Youth are placed in housing units consistent with their risk level; and \neach  eligible  Youth  is  reclassified  within  appropriate  timeframes  and  re-housed \naccordingly.  The Facility director shall document the results of this review each month.   \n36. \t  Policies and Procedures.  Within forty-five (45) days of the Effective Date, LCJDC \nshall develop policies and procedures, including an instrument to be used during intake, \nregarding a housing classification system.  The policy shall specify the procedures for \ninitial and re-classification, housing assignments, and supervision procedures flowing \nfrom the assessment of risk.  The policy should include timelines for classification and \nthe  events  or  incidents  that  trigger  reclassification.    The  policy  shall  provide  for \nsupervision of children according to their classification pursuant to the policy.  LCJDC’s \nclassification policy shall address at least the following: \na.\t   Separation of older from younger residents; \nb. \t  Separation of males from females; \nc. \t  The juvenile’s history of delinquency and charge offense; \nd. \t  Vulnerability to victimization;  \ne. \t  Gang membership or affiliation;  \nf.\t   Separation of violent from non-violent Youth; \ng.\t   Maturity level of Youth involved; \nh. \t  Presence of mental or physical disabilities; \ni. \t  Suicide risk; \nj.\t   Specific information about Youths who need to be separated from each other; and  \nk. \t  Plans to protect the safety of Youth who have been victimized at a facility or who \nhave concerns about their safety. \n7 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 8 of 29 PageID #: 58 \n37. \t  Quality Assurance.  Each month, LCJDC shall aggregate all classification data and \nensure that the policies above are followed for each Youth admitted to the Facility.  \nMonthly statistics shall be assembled to allow assessment changes over time.  Each \nmonthly report shall include: \na. \t  Each Youth’s initial classification; the date of admission; the date and time each \nYouth received his or her classification status; any reclassification; and other \nsubsequent housing assignments; \nb.  \t Trends  and/or  patterns  regarding  the  classification  data  (e.g.,  frequency  of \nreclassifications and assaults); \nc. \t  Specific interventions that have been or will be implemented in response to the \nunderlying conditions that may have contributed to problematic patterns or trends; \nand \nd.  \t Status reports on the effectiveness of interventions undertaken in response to \nidentified trends from previous months. \nC.  \t Use of Force \nConsistent with Constitutional requirements that detained Youth should be protected  \nfrom  harm  and  from  the  serious  risk  of  harm,  these  provisions  are  designed  to  create  a \ncomprehensive use of force policy which shall be implemented by Staff who have been properly \ntrained, so that Youth are not subjected to such harm from unwarranted or excessive force by the  \nStaff at the Facility.  \n38. \t  Policies and Procedures on Use of Force and Restraints, Generally.  Within thirty \n(30) days of the Effective Date, LCJDC shall adopt a policy for the Use of Force and \nRestraints, which shall at least: \na.\t   Ensure that Staff use the least amount of Force appropriate to the risk posed by \nthe Youth to stabilize the situation and protect the safety of the involved Youth \nand others.  As soon as the Youth regains self-control, Staff shall temper their use \nof physical Force and stop using mechanical Restraints with respect to the Youth \ninvolved. \nb. \t  Limit Use of Force or Restraint to exceptional situations where the Youth is  \ncurrently physically violent, poses an  immediate danger to self or others, and \nwhere LCJDC has attempted and exhausted a graduated set of interventions that \navoid  or  minimize  the  Use  of  Force  or  Restraints  and  permit  only  the  least \nrestrictive measures to prevent physical harm to the Youth or others; \nc. \t  Prohibit the Use of Force or Restraints as punishment or in retaliation for verbal  \ndisobedience; \nd. \t  Prohibit the use of unapproved forms of Force or Restraint; \n8 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 9 of 29 PageID #: 59 \ne. \t  Require the prompt documentation and reporting of all Uses of Force or Restraint; \nf.\t   Require that any attempt at non-physical alternatives be documented in a Youth’s \nfile; \ng.\t   Ensure  that  Staff  are  held  accountable  for  excessive  Force  or  inappropriate  \nRestraint through a disciplinary process; \nh. \t  Ensure that Youth who have been subjected to Force or Restraint are evaluated by \nQualified  Medical  Personnel  or  transported  to  a  medical  emergency  facility \npromptly following the incident if the Youth claims an injury or requests medical  \nattention, or if a reasonable person would believe the Youth has been injured; \ni. \t  Require  investigation  and  written  documentation  of  all  incidents  involving  \nviolence, all Uses of Force, use of Restraint and all allegations of abuse; \nj.\t   Ensure that no Youth are Restrained to fixed objects; \nk. \t  Include  verbal  and  non-verbal  de-escalation  techniques  and  a  continuum  of \nRestraint techniques; \nl. \t  Provide guidance for Staff on using safe alternatives if the authorized techniques  \nare impractical given the circumstances and a description of the manner in which \nForce or Restraints for control shall be imposed, supervised, terminated, and \ndocumented; \nm.\t   Provide that Staff follow a graduated set of interventions that avoid the Use of \nForce or Restraints, employ a range of interventions or actions before using Force \nor Restraints, permit only the least restrictive measures to prevent physical harm \nto the Youth or others, and permit Use of Force or Restraints for the minimum \namount of time necessary to bring the situation under control; and  \nn. \t  Provide  that  only  Staff  specifically  trained  in  the  application  of  Force  and \nRestraints are permitted to use such techniques or devices, and that Staff only use \ntechniques or devices approved by policy. \n39.\t   Training.  Staff  shall  receive  regular  periodic  training  in  conflict  management,  de­\nescalation  of  confrontations,  crisis  intervention,  management  of  assaultive  behavior, \nminimizing trauma involved in the Use of Force, and the Facility’s continuum of methods \nof control.  In addition, Staff shall receive annual training on situations in which Use of \nForce or Restraints is or is not justified, permitted methods of Force and Restraints,  \nappropriate techniques for application of Force and Restraints, and guidance to Staff in \ndeciding what levels of Force and Restraints to use if that becomes necessary.  \n40.\t   Elimination of Unsafe Restraint Practices.  No later than the Effective Date, LCJDC \nshall not shackle or restrain Youth to their beds as a disciplinary measure. \n9 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 10 of 29 PageID #: 60 \n41.\t   Quality Assurance.  Each month, not later than the tenth (10th) day of the next month, \nthe Facility director shall review all incidents involving use of Force and Restraint to \nensure that all Uses of Force and Restraint and reports on Uses of Force and Restraint \nwere done in accordance with this Agreement.  The Facility director shall also ensure that \nappropriate sanctions are imposed on any Staff member who fails to comply with Use of  \nForce policies. \nD. \t  Behavior Management \nThe  behavior  management  provisions  below  are  designed  to  encourage  Youth \ncompliance with facility rules by providing positive incentives, and to provide staff with a \nvariety of disciplinary options in lieu of Isolation. \n42.\t   Behavioral Management.  Within six (6) months of the Effective Date, LCJDC shall \nimplement a behavior management system that provides positive incentives for changing \nYouth behavior, and that outlines prohibited behaviors and the consequences for those \nbehaviors.  These incentives shall be documented in the Youth’s file following each use \nand  reviewed  by  shift  supervisors  to  determine  the  frequency  and  outcome  of  any \nincentive.  The behavior management system shall also address the use of Isolation as a \nresponse to Youth behavior. \n43. \t  Distinction Between Major and Minor Rule Violations.  LCJDC shall consult with \noutside technical assistance (see  infra ¶ 102) on developing and incorporating into the \nbehavior management system a distinction between major and minor rule violations.  \nYouth accused of major rule violations shall be accorded the full due process protections \nset forth below.  Youth accused of minor rule violations shall receive a written notice of  \nthe alleged violation as soon as reasonably practicable following the incident.  The notice \nshall contain any information that is the basis for LCJDC’s conclusion that the violation \nhas occurred.  The behavior management system shall include an informal means for \nYouth accused of a minor rule violation to contest the violation finding. \n44. \t  Quality Assurance.  Each month, the Facility director shall examine 20% of Youth files \nto ensure that all Staff are using the behavior management tool in accordance with the \nterms of this Agreement.  This review shall be documented and available for review.  \nE. \t  Isolation \nThe following provisions will ensure that Isolation is used only when Youth pose an \nimmediate threat to themselves or others and that Isolation is not used when a less restrictive \nmethod would be more effective.  These provisions are also designed to discontinue over-\nreliance on Isolation by implementing a robust behavior management program that both rewards \nYouth for compliant behavior, and sanctions Youth for violating the facility’s rules. \n45.\t   Interim Measure Regarding the Use of Disciplinary Isolation.  LCJDC will review the \neffectiveness of its use of disciplinary Isolation, and will consult with DOJ and technical \nassistance  providers  about  ways  to  move  toward  the  elimination  of  Isolation  for  \ndisciplinary reasons.  A revised policy and procedure on disciplinary Isolation will be  \npromulgated within three (3) months of the Effective Date, with the expectation that \n10 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 11 of 29 PageID #: 61 \nLCJDC will cease using disciplinary Isolation  within six (6) months of the Effective \nDate.  In the interim, disciplinary Isolation should only be used as a sanction for a major \nrule violation, and each Youth should receive a due process hearing prior to being sent to \ndisciplinary  Isolation.  During  this  interim  period,  if  disciplinary  Isolation  is  used, \nLDJDC  shall  prohibit  periods  of  disciplinary  Isolation  longer  than  twenty-four  (24)  \nhours, except in extraordinary circumstances and with the express written authorization \nof the Facility director.  Disciplinary Isolation shall be limited to situations when less \nsevere disciplinary measures have proven ineffective. \n46.\t   Policies and Procedures.  Within six (6) months of the Effective Date, LCJDC shall \nrevise its policies and procedures consistent with the following principles for the use of \nIsolation:  \na.\t   Isolation is only permitted when a Youth’s behavior threatens imminent harm to \nthe Youth or others.  LCJDC will no longer use Isolation as a form of discipline \nor punishment. \nb. \t  Prior to using Isolation, Staff shall utilize less restrictive techniques, including  \ntalking with Youth to de-escalate the situation and bringing in Staff, QMHPs, \nfamily members or other Youth to talk with the Youth.  Prior to using Isolation or \nimmediately after placing a Youth in Isolation, Staff shall explain to the Youth the \nreasons  for  the  Isolation,  and  the  fact  that  he  or  she  will  be  released  upon \nregaining self-control.  \nc.\t   Youth are in Isolation only for the amount of time necessary for the Youth to \nregain self-control and no longer pose a threat.  As soon as the Youth’s behavior \nceases  to  threaten  imminent  harm  to  self  or  others  or  serious  destruction  of  \nproperty, Staff shall release him or her back to routine detention, school or other \nprogramming. \nd. \t  Staff shall notify the unit supervisor as soon as a Youth is placed in Isolation. \ne.\t   During the time that a Youth is in Isolation, Staff shall provide one-on-one crisis \nintervention and observation.  The Staff member should be either in the sleeping  \nroom with the Youth or directly outside the sleeping room during the entire period \nof Isolation providing observation of the Youth and interaction as appropriate.  \nStaff shall document their observations on a time sheet maintained beside the  \nYouth’s room.  The observing Staff member shall document the time of the \nobservation and shall initial the time sheet beside the time of the observation. \nf.\t   A Qualified Medical Professional or health-trained Staff shall directly monitor \nany Youth in Isolation at least every fifteen (15) minutes. \ng.\t   Youth shall not be held in Isolation for a continuous period longer than one (1) \nhour.  If the LCJDC director determines that a Youth still requires Isolation after \none (1) hour, a QMHP or the LCJDC director shall arrange for the Youth to be \ntransported to a local mental health facility or hospital.  If transport to a local \nmental health facility or hospital is not possible due to unavailability of mental  \n11 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 12 of 29 PageID #: 62 \nhealth or medical services, LCJDC shall continue to monitor the Youth under \nParagraphs 46(e) and 46(f) until such servicers are available or the Youth regains \ncontrol and can be released from Isolation. \nh. \t  If  at  any  time  during  Isolation  a  Qualified  Medical  Professional  or  QMHP, \nbelieves the level of crisis service needed is not available at LCJDC, the Youth  \nshall be transported to a location where those services can be obtained (e.g., local \nmental health treatment facility or hospital).  \ni.\t   Youth in Isolation have reasonable access to water, toilet facilities, and hygiene \nsupplies. \nj.\t   All uses of Isolation shall require written justification and authorization by a shift \nsupervisor.  All instances of Isolation, all justifications for the use of Isolation, \nand all authorizations, shall be noted in the Youth’s file. \n47.\t   Facility Director Notification of Isolation.  The Facility director  shall be notified of all \nperiods of Isolation as follows: \na.\t   For all periods of cumulative Isolation extending beyond two hours within a 24­\nhour period, notification shall occur within 30 minutes of the cumulative Isolation \nextending beyond two hours; and \nb. \t  For all periods of Isolation wherein Youth are isolated three or more times within \none week, regardless of the length of time for each Isolation period, notification \nshall occur within 30 minutes of the third incident of Isolation.  \nc.\t   Notification to the Facility director shall include the circumstances and facts \nrelated to the Youth’s ongoing imminent threat to self or others and the less \nsevere measures that have been attempted and proven ineffective.  The Facility  \ndirector shall refer the Youth to a QMHP for evaluation and treatment. \n48.\t   Services for Youth in Isolation.  Youth in Isolation shall continue to receive meals,  \nshowers, and educational and recreational services.

Compliance  with  this  provision  shall  be  documented  in  writing  and \nmaintained in the Youth’s file.  \n49.\t   Data Gathering Regarding Youth in Isolation.  For each instance of Isolation, Staff \nshall log the length of time the Youth remained in Isolation, the reason for the Isolation, \nand Youth’s behavior while in Isolation.  The data shall be maintained in the Youth’s file  \nand shall be reviewed in Quality Assurance assessments. \n50.\t   Quality Assurance.  Each month, the Facility Director shall aggregate and analyze all \ndata on the use of Isolation and provide feedback to Staff as frequently as needed to  \nensure that all Isolation episodes meet the requirements of this subsection.  Such review, \nand  the  monthly  accuracy  rate,  shall  be  documented.    Monthly  statistics  shall  be \nassembled to allow assessment of changes over time.  The Facility director shall review \n12 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 13 of 29 PageID #: 63 \nall Isolation data and provide monthly feedback to Staff to ensure that all Isolation \nprocedures are properly followed. \nF. \t  Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Care \nThese provisions are designed to ensure compliance with Constitutional requirements for \nadequate  mental  health  treatment  and  suicide  prevention  by  adopting  and  implementing \ntreatment and strategies to protect Youth susceptible to suicidal ideation  from self-harm.  These \nprovisions are consistent with Miss. Code Ann. §43-21-321(6)(m)-(n), which require that Youth \nhave  access  to  counseling  and  that  Youth  be  referred  to  other  counseling  services  “when  \nnecessary,” including for mental health services and crisis intervention.  \n51.\t   Tools.

Youth on Suicide Precautions shall not be \nplaced in Isolation unless specifically authorized by a QMHP.  Any such Isolation and its \njustification shall be thoroughly documented in the accompanying incident report, a copy \nof which shall be maintained in the Youth’s file. \n13 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc #: 3-1 Filed: 05/13/15 14 of 29 PageID #: 64 \n58.\t   QMHP Assessment, Reassessment and Monitoring of Youth on Suicide Precautions. \nAny Youth placed on Suicide Precautions shall be evaluated by a QMHP no later than \none (1) hour after the Youth is placed on Suicide Precautions.  In this assessment, the  \nQMHP shall determine the extent of the risk of suicide, write any appropriate orders, and \nregularly monitor the Youth.  The QMHP shall regularly, but no less than daily, reassess \nYouth on Suicide Precautions to determine whether the level of precaution or supervision \nshould be raised or lowered, and shall record these reassessments in the Youth’s medical \nchart.  Only a QMHP may raise, lower, or terminate a Youth’s Suicide Precaution level \nor status.  Following each daily assessment, the QMHP shall provide direct care Staff \nwith relevant information regarding a Youth on Suicide Precautions that affects the direct \ncare Staff’s duties and responsibilities for supervising the Youth, including at least: \nknown sources of stress for the potentially suicidal Youth; the specific risks posed; and \ncoping mechanisms or activities that may mitigate the risk of harm.

The United States files this Complaint pursuant to the pattern or practice \nprovision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141, \nto enjoin Defendant Leflore County (\"Leflore\") from depriving children confined in the Leflore \nCounty Juvenile Detention Center (\"Detention Center\") ofrights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured or protected by the Constitution and laws ofthe United States. \nJURISDICTION, STANDING and VENUE \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1345. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1 Filed: 05/12/15 2 of 8 PageiD #: 2 \n4.  Venue in the United States District Court for the Northern District ofMississippi \nis proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff is the United States ofAmerica. \n6.  Defendant is Leflore County, Mississippi. \n7.  Leflore is a governmental authority with responsibility for the administration of \njuvenile justice or the incarceration ofjuveniles within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 14141, and it \noperates the Detention Center in Greenwood, Mississippi.  This action concerns conditions at the \nDetention Center. \n8.  Leflore is legally responsible, in whole or in pa1t, for the operation ofthe \nDetention Center and for the safety and welfare of the children confined there. \n9.  Leflore is obligated to operate the Detention Center in a manner that does not. \ninfringe upon the federal rights, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States and by other federal law, of children confined at the Detention Center. \nI0.  At all relevant times, Leflore has acted or failed to act tmder color of state law. \nFACTS \nThe Detention Center \n11.  The Detention Center is a 30-bed short-term facility that Leflore owns and \noperates for the detention of children.  Male and female children between I 0 and 17 years of age \nare typically detained at the Detention Center for periods ranging from a few hours to more than \n2 \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1 Filed: 05/12/15 3 of 8 PageiD #: 3 \n30 days, although the Detention Center has the capability to house children for 90 days.  The \nDetention Center can house hundreds of children each year, with some children returning to the \nDetention Center multiple times or in quick succession. \n12.  In addition to detaining children from Leflore, the Detention Center contracts with \nseveral other Mississippi counties to detain children.  Among the counties that contract with \nLeflore for juvenile detention are Attala, Bolivar, Calhoun, Carroll, Choctaw, Coahoma, \nGrenada, Holmes, Humphrey, Leake, Montgomery, Panola, Quitman, Sunflower, Tallahatchie, \nTate, Tunica, Yalobusha and Webster. \nThe United States' Investigation \n13.  The United States, pursuant to an investigation of the Detention Center, has \ndetermined that Leflore, through its acts and omissions, engages in a pattern or practice of \nconduct that violates the Constitutional and statutory rights of youth at the Detention Center. \n14.  The United States' findings are outlined in a March 31, 2011 Letter of Findings, \nwhich is attached and incorporated here by reference.  Specifically, the investigation uncovered \n\"undue use of restraints, arbitrary imposition ofpunishment, inadequate grievance procedmes, \nfailure to repmt and investigate abuse, inadequate classification systems, inadequate \nrehabilitative treatment, inadequate medical and mental health care, inadequate suicide risk \nprotections, inadequate environmental safety, inadequate staffing, and inadequate educational \nservices.\" \n15.  After the release ofthe Findings Letter, the United States conducted a \nsupplemental on-site inspection in December 2013.  The Detention Center had by then ended \n3 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1 Filed: 05/12/15 4 of 8 PageiD #: 4 \nsome of its most troubling practices, such as chaining children to fixed objects.  However, the \n2013 inspection revealed ongoing violations of youth's Fourteenth Amendment rights at the \nDetention Center, including those described in paragraphs 18-23 below. \n16.  In the months following the 2013 on-site visit, the United States and Leflore \nentered into negotiations to resolve the security and facility conditions violations identified in the \nFindings Letter.  The United States and Leflore have reached a settlement to resolve those claims \nand contemporaneously are filing a \"Joint Motion for Entry of Settlement Agreement\" and \n\"Memorandum Brief in Support of Entry of Settlement Agreement.\" \n17.  On September 16, 2013, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant issued a proclamation \nplacing the Leflore county school district (which includes the school at the Detention Center) \nunder the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Board of Education (\"Board\") pursuant to Mississippi \nlaw and authorized the Board \"to abolish the district and its existing school board and \nsuperintendent of schools.\" As a result, the State and Board provide educational services at the \nDetention Center school and Leflore claims that it no longer is involved in providing education \nservices at the Detention Center.  Thus, the Settlement Agreement between the United States and \nLeflore does not resolve the United States' findings of violations of children's educational rights \nat Leflore. \nInadequate Suicide Prevention Practices \n18.  The Findings Letter warned of suicide hazards in children's cells, including \nprotrusions and tying-otf points that pose a risk of hanging;  The Detention Center does not \nprotect children against the risk of suicide and still fails to screen or monitor potentially suicidal \n4 \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1 Filed: 05/12/15 5 of 8 PageiD #: 5 \nchildren.  On November 21,2013, a boy at the Detention Center attempted suicide, which \ndemonstrated the failure of the Detention Center's screening and monitoring of potentially \nsuicidal children.  The suicide attempt occurred due to conditions that have existed at the \nDetention Center for years, including failure to eliminate tying-off points, to monitor children \nand to take suicide precautions. \nUnreasonable Risks to Safety and Welfare \n19.  The Detention Center staff fails to supervise children consistently and \nappropriately.  The Detention Center has experienced serious lapses in security (including \nconcealment of contraband and a successful escape) even after the release ofthe Findings Letter. \nThese security lapses jeopardize the safety of children and staff. \n20.  The Detention Center's physical environment poses an unreasonable risk to the \nsafety and welfare of detained children.  Cells and showers are extremely dirty, which exposes \nchildren to the risk of disease and infectious agents. \n21.  The Detention Center's fire safety and emergency planning is inadequate and \nexposes both children and staffto an unnecessarily high risk of harm, including death.  The fire \nplan for evacuating children and staff is dangerous, and the Detention Center does not have an \nadequate plan for evacuation in the event of a tornado or other emergency. \nFailure to Investigate Abuse \n22.  The Detention Center is obligated to conduct internal investigations of alleged \nabuse to keep children reasonably safe.  Once an allegQ.tion of abuse has been made, a proper \ninvestigation is required to collect evidence to verify or disprove the allegation. \n5 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1 Filed: 05/12/15 6 of 8 PageiD #: 6 \n23.  The Detention Center does not follow its own procedures for reporting and \ninvestigating allegations of child abuse.  Internal investigations are cursory and do not include \nexamination by medical staff, photographs of alleged injuries, or other basic elements of accurate \ninvestigations. \nViolations of Fourteenth Amendment \n24.  The United States incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs \n1-23 as if fully setforth herein. \n25.  Let1ore's acts and omissions alleged in Paragraphs 1-23 constitute a pattern or \npractice of conduct that violates the federal rights of children confined at the Detention Center, \nas protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n26.  Unless restrained by this Court, Let1ore will continue to engage in the acts and \nomissions set forth in Paragraphs 1-23 that deprive children confmed at the Detention Center of \nrights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution of the United States, \ncausing irreparable harm to these children. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n27.  The Attorney General is authorized, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141, to seek \nequitable and declaratory relief. \n\nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that this Court enter an order: \n\n6 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1 Filed: 05/12/15 7 of 8 PageiD #: 7 \na.  Declaring that the acts, omissions, and practices of Leflore set forth in \nParagraph 1-23 above constitute a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives the children \ndetained at the Detention Center ofthe rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by \nthe Constitution or laws of the United States, and that those acts, orriissions, and practices violate \nthe Constitution and laws ofthe United States; \nb.  Permanently enjoining Leflore, its officers, agents, employees, subordinates, \nsuccessors in office, and all those acting in concert or participation with .it from continuing the \nacts, omissions, and practices set forth in Paragraphs 1-23 above, and requiring Leflore to take \nsuch actions as will ensure that lawful conditions ofconfinement are afforded to children at the \nDetention Center; and \nc.  Granting such other and further equitable relief as the Court may deem just and \nproper. \n7 \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1 Filed: 05/12/15 8 of 8 PageiD #: 8 \nDATE:  May 12,2015  Respectfully submitted, \nFELICIA C.

D.C. 20530 \nI\n: \nMAR 31 2011 \n) \nThe Honorable Robert Moore \nChair, Leflore County Board of Supervisors \n306 West Market Street \nGreenwood, Mississippi  38930-4355 \nRe:  Investigation of the Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center \nDear Chairman Moore: \nI write to report the fmdings ofthe Civil Rights Division's investigation of conditions at \nthe Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center (\"LCJDC\") in Greenwood, Mississippi.  On \nAu.,oust 14, 2009, we notified .Leflore County, Mississippi, of our intent to conduct an \ninvestigation of LCJDC pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997 (\"CRIPA\"), and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 14141 (\"Section 14141\").  Both CRIPA and Section 14141 give the United States Department \nofJustice (\"DOJ\") authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates \nthe constitutional or federal statutory rights ofyouth in juvenile justice institutions. \nWe thank th« staff members at LCJDC for their helpful and professional conduct \nthroughout the course ofthe investigation. We received complete cooperation and appreciate \ntheir receptiveness to our consultants' on-site recommendations.  Staff assisted our investigation \nby providing access to records and personnel and by promptly responding to our requests in a \ntransparent manner.  We have every reason to believe that the County and the staff of LCJDC are \ncommitted to remedying deficiencies at the facility. \nI. SUMMARY OF FINDlNGS \nThe youth confmed to LCJDC are subjected to conditions that violate their constitutional \nand federal statutory rights.  Our investigation revealed systemic, egregious, and dangerous \nabuses perpetuated by a lack of accountability and controls.  LCJDC fails to prevent \nunconstitutional harms, or minimize the risk ofsuch harms, through undue use ofrestraints, \narbitrary imposition of punishment, inadequate grievance procedures, failure to report and \ninvestigate abuse, inadeqJlllte classification systems, inadequate rehabilitative treatment, \ninadequate medical a11d mental health care, inadequate suicide risk protections, inadequate \nenvironmental safety, inadequate staffmg, and inadequate educational services.  We found that: \nl \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 2 of 30 PageiD #: 10 \n. 2. ' \n• \t Youth are dangerously and routinely shackled to metal beds for discipline and \n\npunishment; \n\n• \t Staffhave unfettered discretion to immediately administer punishment, and isolation is \nused excessively for punishment and control; \n• \t Suicidal youth are not assessed by mental health professionals despite known risks; \n• \t Internal investigations dismiss abuse complaints against staff as manipulative; and \n• \t No accoriunodations exist for children with learning disabilities . \n. These systemic deficiencies exist because generally accepted juvenile justice standards \nare not followed.  We found that LCJDC staffmembers do not receive minimally adequate \n\ntraining'and that existing policies and procedures are inadequate to ensure constitutionally \n\n· adequate care and custody ofthe youth confmed to the facility.  Staff members fail to report \n\nallegations of abuse to the State and appear to routinely violate youths' rights with impunity. \nThe widespread and significant deficiencies at the facility are a result of significant \n\ndepartures :from accepted juvenile justice standards and violate the Fourteenth Amendment's \n\nmandate that youth in custody be protected from harm.. In this letter, we provide \n\nreco=endations that are minimally necessary to bring.the facility into compliance with the \n\nConstitution and federal law. \n\nII.  INVESTIGATION \nOn November 11-12, 2009; we conducted an on-sire inspeci:iol). ofLCJDC accompanied \nby expert consultants in the areas of protection :from harm and education.  Before, during, and \nafter our tour, we reviewed extensive documentation provided by the County, including policies \nand procedures, incident reports, unit logs, .and training materials.  Additiomilly, we interviewed \nLCJDC administrators, staff, and youth.  We observed youths in a variety of settings, including \n. their living units, dining areas, and in the facility's only classroom: Consistent with our \ncommitment to conduct a transparent investigation and provide techhical assistance, our expert \n.c onsultants conveyed their initial impressions and concerns to the County during exit \nconferences held at the conclusion of the tour. \nm. BACKGROUND \nThe LCIDC is a 30-bed short-term facility owned and operated by Leflore County for the \ndetention of youth.  Male and female youth between 10 and 17 years of age are· detained at \nLCJDC for periods ranging from a few hours to more than 30 (\\ays.  In addition to detaining \nyouth :from Leflore County, the facility contracts with 19 other Mississippi counties to detain \nyouth.1 As required by state statute, LCJDC and other juvenile justice facilities in Mississippi \nare monitored by the State Department ofPublic Safety's Juvenile Detenti9n Facilities \nMonitoring Unit on a quarterly basis.  Despite the relatively limited bed capacity ofLCJDC, the \nnumber ofyouths detained at the facility, over time, is significant.  During the period between \n1  The counties that.contract with Leflore County for juvenile detention include Attala, Bolivar, Ca!hmm, \n\nCarroll, Choctaw, Coahoma, Grenada, Hotmes, Humphrey, Leake, Montgomery, Panola, Quitman, Sunflower, \n\nTallahatchie, Tate, Tunica, Yalobusha, and Webster.  · \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 3 of 30 PageiD #: 11 \n-3­\nJuly 2008 and September 2009,544 different youths were held at the facility.  Notably, some of \nthese 544 youths were detained at the facility multiple times during the time period.  During our \non-site visit in November 2009, the facility had a youth population ofseven males and six \nfemales who were from eight different counties. \nThe two-story LCJDC building was converted from a mental health facility to a juvenile \nfacility in 1995, with the original construction dating back to the 1950s. In addition to LCJDC,. \nthe building houses the Leflore County Youth Court and offices for the court's counselors.  The \n·juvenile detention portion of the building consists oftwo floors and is· outfitted like an adult jail. \nThe layout is primarily double-bunked cells with metal frame·beds, built-in desks or tables, and \nstainless steel toilets and sinks.  Each cell has a metal door with a small window, and \"lighting is \ncontrolled externally by a sw:\\tch near the door.  The upper level customarily houses female \nyouths and includes the facility's only classroom, which is outfitted with books, desks, and an \nadjacent computer lab.  The lower level ofLCIDC customarily houses male youths and has a \nsmall dayroom for programming in addition to cells.  An external door on the'lower level \nhallway connects the cells to a very small outdoor \"recreation area\" that is completely enclosed \nby tall brick walls..This outdoor recreation area is designated as the point of egress ·in case of \nfrre or other emergency.  · \nIV.  FINDINGS \nInviolation of their constitutional rights, youth at LCIDC are inappropriately and \ndangerously restrained, arbitrarily punished, denied adequate medical and mental health care; not \nprotected from suicide risk, inadequately supervised, and inadequately educated. Unsafe \nconditions ofconfmement, combined with a paucity of meaningful programming, education and \nother activities, create an environment at LCJDC that is dangerous and detrimental to youth \ndevelopment and well-being.  The environment is especially harmful for those youth who spend \nlong periods oftime at LCIDC \"or who frequently. return to the facility. \nA. \t LEFLORE COUNTY IS FAILING TO PROTECT YOUTH FROM HARM AT \n\nLCJDC \n\nCRIPA and Section 14141 authorize DOJ to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of \n. conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory·rights of youth in juvenile justiCe \ninstitutions.  42 U.S.C. § 1997; 42 U.S.C. § 14141.  Youth detained at LCIDC are protected by \nthe Fourteenth Amendmttnt and have a substantive due process right to reasonably safe \nconditions of confmement and freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints.  Youngberg v. \nRomeo, ~57 U.S. 307,315-16 (1982) (\"Ifit is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted \ncriminals in unsafe conditions, it must be unconstitutional to confine the involuntarily [detained] \n-who may not be punished at all· in unsafe conditions.\") .. The Fourteenth Amendment, rather \nthan the Eighth Amendment, applies because the youth are held for detention or rehabilitation, \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 4 of 30 PageiD #: -12 \n-4­\nnot punishment. 2  The Mississippi youth delinquency statute's statement cifpwpose provides \nthat \"each child coming within the jurisdiction of the youth court ... become a responsible, \naccountable and productive citizen, and that each such child shall receive such care, guidance \nand control, preferably in such child's own home as is conducive toward that end and is in the \nstate's and the child's best interest.\"  Miss.·Code Ann.§ 43-21-103, \nTo detennine whether the Fourteenth Amendment was violated, a balancing test must be \napplied:  \"[I]t is necessary to balance 'the liberty of the individual' and 'thll demands of an \norganized society.\"' Youngberg. 457 U.S. at 320 (quoting Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 542 \n(1961)).  The Youngberg Court went on to hold that \"Ifthere is to. be any uniformity in \nprotecting these interests, this balancing cannot be left to the unguided discretion of a judge or \njury.\" Id. at 321.  Instead, the Court held that there is a constitutional violation if detaining \nofficials substantially depart from generally accepted professional standards, and that departure \nendangers youth in their care.  See id. at 314. \nAs a general matter, the Supreme .Court has held that corrections officials must take \nreasonable steps to guarantee detainees' safety and provide \"humane conditions\" of confinement. \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994); Hare v. Citv ofCorinth, 741;'.3d 633, 639 (5th Cir. \n1996) (recognizing a duty to provide detainees with basic human needs including protection \nfrom harm).  In addition, an official's failure to maintain adequate policies, procedures, and \na\npractices for the prevention ofsuicides may violate  detainee's due process rights.  Silva v. \nDonley County Texas, 32 F.3d 566, 1994 WL 442404, *5-7 (5th Cir. 1994) (urtpilb!ished) \n(holding sheriff's failure to establish suicide detection and prevention training for jail personnel, \ncondoning de facto policy of sporadic cell checks, and absence ofa policy for observing \"at-risk\" \ndetainees may rise to deliberate indifference to known risk of suicide in detention settings). \n.  Finally, conditions of confinement claims may be based not only upon existing physical \nhann to youth, but also on conditions that threaten to cause future harm.  Hel!ing v.

Youth atLCJDC are subjected to undue restraint. \nOur investigation revealed munerous uses ofdangerous and unnecessary restraints at \nLCJDC.  The justifications offered by staff for the use ofthe restraints were ambiguous or \nclearly inappropriate.  Youth are frequently shackled to the bed in their cell in response to non­\ndangerous actions and for punislunent.  Documentation ofthe application of restraints failed to \nadequately describe the reasons for or the duration ofthe uses ofrestraint.3 \nYouth at LCJDC may not be unduly restrained or subjected to exce·ssive use of force by \nstaff.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 316; Morales v. Tunnan, 364 F. Supp. 166, 173 (E.D. Tex. \n1973) (issuing a preliminary injunction where the court found that juvenile facilities' widespread \npractice ofbeating, slapping, kicking, and otherwise abusing youth in the absence of exigent \ncircumstances violated youths' rights).  In determining whether a violation exists under the \nEighth Amendment, courts consider whether \"force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain \nor restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpos(l of causing harin\" to \ndetermine whether force was excessive.  Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6 (1992) (citing \nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 320-21 (1986).  Prison officials \"may take all reasonable steps \nto insure proper prison discipline, security and order\" but must ensure \"that inmates are not \nsubjected to any punishment beyond that which is necessary for [] orderly administration.\" \nGates v. Collier. 501 F.2d at 1309.  Hence, the use offorce after an irunate has been subdued and \nan emergency has dissipated, or which is disproportionate to the force needed to regain control, \nvioiates the Eighth Amendment.  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 738 (2002) (leaving an inmate \nhandcuffed to a post after order had been regained constituted cruel and unusual punishment); . \nValencia v. Wiggins, 981 F. 2d 1440, 1447 (5th Cir. 1993) (applying a chokehold on disruptive \ninmate who refused to exit cell and striking irunate while handcuffed, kneeling, and non-resisting· \nwas malicious and sadistic, causing harm) ..The use ofmechanical restraints should be limited to \ncircumstances where a youth presents a clear danger to herself or others.  See H.C. by Hewett v. \nJarrard, 786 F.2d 1080, 1086 (11th Cir. 1986) (disproportionate response ofguard to juvenile \ndetainee, which included shackling to bed, \"amounted to punishment in violation of due process. \nclause\").  · \nGenerally accepted professional standards require. that staff only use physical force or \nmechanical restraints to the degree and duration necessary to bring a situation under control.' \nEvery application of mechanical restraints - including handcuffs, leg shackles, belly chains, or \nother such restraints - must be fully documented, including the circumstances leading to the \napplication of restraints and the duration that the restraints were applied.  Any restrained juvenile \nshould be constantly observed by staff to (lnsure safety. \n3  '  The facility's policy manual is ambiguous about the County's expectation for documenting uses of force, \nOne'section states that the ''nse afforce resulting in injury to staff or youth and the use of mechanical restraints will \nbe fully documented and reported,\" suggesting that only use of force incidents involving injury should be \ndocumented. Several pages later, however, the manual states that a ''written report ... will be completed no later \nthan seventy-two (72) hours following the incident depending on the circumstances ofthe incident.\" There is no \nexplanation ofthe determinative circumstances, and the quote suggests that incident reports are required even where \nthere is no injury.  Regardless ofwhich part of the policy manual is the County's official policy, neither. is consistent \nwith generally accepted professional standards, which provide that facility staff document all incidents, except for \nhandcuffs used in transportation, in which physical force or mechanical reslraints are used. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 6 of 30 PageiD #: 14 \n-6­\nExamples ofexcessive or undue restraints and lack of adequate documentation at LCJDC \ninclude: \n• \t In October 2008, A.A.,4 a 13 year old detainee, began kicking his cell door and \ncursing.  Two officers entered the youth's cell and \"chained\". A.A. to the bed.  There \nis no documentation of the precise manner or length oftime that the youth was \nrestrained.  Staff later entered A.A.'s room to discover that he had defecated and \nthrown feces on the cell window.  He was restrained a third time in November 2008 \nfor 15 minutes as punishment for kicking and beating on the door. \n• \t B.B. was placed in leg restraints' in October 2008 as punishment for flooding the toilet \nin his cell.  He was released once he promised to stop flooding the cell. \nwas \n• \t In February 2009,: C.C:  removed from class and isolated in his cell for failure to \nfollow Classroom rules.  Once C. C. entered his cell, he began beating on the doors \nand walls.  Two officers then entered the cell and placed C.C. in leg shackles. \n• \t In June 2009, leg irons were placed on D.D. to prevent him from banging'on the cell \ndoor.  There is no documentation·regarding the duration ofthis restraint. \n· •  In May 2010, a youth banged on his door to request hygienic tissue. A detention \nofficer denied the request, and detention staff subsequently went from room to room \nrestraining youths With shackles and handcuffs.  One youth·was hogtied to the bed \n· after he argued With detention officers, and all youths remained in the restraints for \napproximately one houi:. \nIn none of the circumstances described above were the youths a danger to themselves or \nto others.  Banging or kicking doors or walls, cursing, shouting, and flooding a cell are annoying \nbehaviors, but none present a danger.  Instead, in each ofthe incidents described above, \n· LCJDC's practice of shackling served a primarily punitive purpose.  Therefore; each restraint \ndescribed above was undue and unconstitutional. \nStaffmembers at LCJDC·freely admit that they restrain youth to beds.  According to \nfacility staff, youth are restrained to the bed when staffcarmot de-escalate a youth's misbehavior \nthrough talking (although none ofthe incidents described above evidence. attempts by staffto de­\nescalate the situation before restraints were applied).  The facility manila! places a time limit of \n15 to 30 minutes on the use ofrestraints.  We were also told that staff usually link restraint \ndevices together to provide enough length for youth to use the toilet while shackled to a bed. \nNeither the purported time constraint nor extending the length ofthe shackling restraint makes \nthis practice acceptable. \nWe conclude that the restraint practices ofLCJDC detention'staffviolate the Constitution \nand egregiously deviate from generally accepted professional standards. \n4 .  Fictional initials are used throughout the letter to preserve the anonymity ofyouths. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 7 of 30 PageiD #: 15 \n• 7. \n2. \t LCJDC violates the due process rights of youth by arbitrarily imposing \npunitive measures. \nOur investigation revealed numerous instances where LCJDC staff imposed sanctions \nwithout following any disciplinary process.  LCJDC must provide youth with procedural due \nprocess ifthey are charged with a disciplinary violation while detained.  See Wolffv. \nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-65 (1974) (fmding that prison disciplinary hearings require due \nprocess with respect to presentation of charges, evidence, and witnesses). \nThere are no processes at LCJDC for notifying youth of facility rules or for unposing \ndiscipline.  The absence of an established disciplinary system results in an informal system Of \ncontrol based on the unfettered discretion ofindividual detention officers; sanctions are \ninnnediately imposed by staff for whatever actions staff deem punishable.  These practices are \nunconstitutional.  For example:  ·  · \n'  ' \n• \t In August 2008, staff recorded'in a facility log that E.E. and F.F. had fought each \nother and were therefore not allowed out of their cells for any reason other than· \nshowering.  ·  · \n• \t In September 2008, G. G. allegedly started a fight in class and was therefore isolated \nin his cell.  According to the facility log, the youth was \"to not come out of his cell .. \n. for any reason.\"  It is unclear how long this restriction was in place. \n• \t In November 2008, H.H. reportedly became disruptive and threatened to kill himself \nwhile in court.  Two detention officers forcibly removed H.H. from the courtroom . \nand placed hlm in his cell. After the youth struck the door of his cell, \"disciplinary \nactions were taken.\" We have no indication of what is meant by \"disciplinary \nactions.\"  ·  · \n• \t In February 2009, some youths were allegedly overheard plotting to !lttaqk a \ndetention officer.  Consequently, \"alljuventles were disciplined by no showering.\" \n• \t Thirteen-year-old l.I. stated during our November 2009 iriterviews that one ofthe \ndetention officers at LCJDC had whipped him with a belt in his room as punishment \nfor being disruptive in class. \nThe lack of any disciplinary system or due process protections for youth at LCJDC \nviolates their constitutiona) rights.  · \n3. \t LCJDC is unlawfully failing to report and investigate abuse. \nLCJDC also unconstitutionally places·youth at risk ofrepeated harm by failing to · · \nproperly report and investigate abuse by staff.  When an allegation of child abuse is made, the \nallegation should be reported to the proper authorities for investigation.  Juvenile justiqe facility \nstaff are typically mandated by statute to report allegations of child abuse to the state's child \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 8 of 30 PageiD #: 16 \n-8­\nprotective services agency.  In Mississippi, \"any person having reasonable cause to suspect that a \n· child is a neglected child or an abused child shall came an oral report to be made immediately , , , \nto the Department of Human Services\" which in turn initiates an investigation.  Miss. Code Ann. \n§ 43-21-353 (1) (2010).  As such, LCJDC staff must report all instances of alleged abuse, \nwithout regard to credibility, to the State Department of Human Services.  This is not occurring. \nIn addition to reporting allegations of abuse to the proper state agency, LCJDC must \n\nconduct internal investigations of alleged abuse in order to keep youth reasonably safe.  Once an \n\nallegation of abuse has been made, a proper investigation is required to protect youth from staff \n\nabuse by collecting evidence to verify or disprove the allegation.  These investigations are \n\nessential to identify staff in need of training and/or discipline, as well as to clear staff who have \n\nbeen wrongfully accused.  The investigation process must have reasonable integrity, preserve. all \n\nphysical evidence (e.g., videotape footage, documentation and photographs ofinjuries, clothing, \n\n. etc.), obtain statements from all youth and staff involved in the incident and those who witnessed .. \nthe incident, and utilize other sources of information to corroborate or refute the allegations (e.g., \nlogbooks, other sources .of facility documentation). \nTo ensure that youth are provided adequate safety, youth subjected to a use offorce must \n\nbe seen, and treated if necessary, by a medical professiotial, and all injuries should be \n\ndocumented.  Medical staff can also be an avenue for youth to report abuse or mistreatment. \n\nFurther, even when youth do not report abuse or mistreatment, medical staff members are \n\nmandated reporters of child.abuse if abuse is suspected due to the nature of an injury. \n\nLCJDC unlawfully fails to provide these protections.  The facility does not have adequate \nprocedures for properly reporting and investigating allega:tions of child abuse.  When asked \nabout procedures that staff follow upon receiving an allegation ofabuse, staff members were \nunaware oftheir duty to report abuse allegations to the State,  Further, internal investigations are \ncursory and do not include examination by medical staff, photographs of alleged injuries, or \nother basic elements necessary for accurate investigations.  Indeed, it appears that the underlying \nassumption of any facility investigation of abuse is that the complaining youth is attempting to \nmanipulate others.  The following examples illustrate the deficiencies with LCJDC  ·  · \ninvestigations: ·  '  · \n• \t In February 2008, youth J.J, alleged that he was sexUliUY assaulted by a staff member \nand later attempted suicide at the facility.  Facility management conducted an \negregiously deficient investigation by speaking with the youth, then speaking with the \n. staff member, and then simply concluding that there was no evidence of a sexual \nassault.  There is no indica,tion that the State was contacted regarding the abuse \nallegations.  In a memorandum notifying a local police chief ofthe results ofthe \ninvestigation, LCJDCs director stated that J.J. was \"using the system against the \n. system to gain sympathy\" in order to avoid a possible felony charge.  The memo \nconcludes with·the exhortation:  ''Do not let this troubled young man's false \nallegations stop [the County] from allowing Leflore County to serving [sic] your \nJuvenile Detainment Needs.. \" \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 9 of 30 PageiD #: 17 \n-9­\n• \t A.January 2009 memorandum reports the conclusion of the facility's grossly \ninadequate investigation into youth K.K.'s allegations that he was assaulted by an \nLCIDC custody officer.  The investigation consisted oftbe director and assistant \ndirector interviewing the accused officer and the officer's supervisor, both of whom \ndenied the assault.  The memorandum notes that K.K. bore no visible signs ofassault \n. but does nqt contain any alleged details of the incident, including the date it allegedly \noccurred.  The director asserts in the memorandum that \"[t]hese juvenile(s) will say \nand do anything to shift the concerns away from what they did or are doing.\"  There \n. is no evidence indicating that these allegations were referred to the State. \nWe fmd that LCIDC's reporting and inve,stigation ofalleged abuse is wholly deficient \n\nand unlawfully violates the rights ofthe young people detained in the facility. \n\n4.  LCJDC's unlawful classification system places youth at great risk. \nYouth at LCJDC are not safe due to the facility's inadequate classification system.  The \nConstitution requires that youth be provided a reasonably safe environment.  In a juvenile justice \nfacility, a critical piece ofkeeping youth safe tu):nS on a classification system to determine where \nand with whom a youthshould be housed.  The classification should take into account a youth's \nage, charge offense, history ofviolence  escape, vulnerability to victimization, gang \n~d\nmembership or affiliation, health and mental health concerns, and institutional history.  . \nLCIDC only considers a youth's size, age, and county ofresidence when making housing \nassignments.  The failure to account for other obviously relevant factors places youth at grave \nrisk ofharm.  During our interviews with youth at the facility, for example, we discovered that \nyouths L.L. and M.M. were both arrested and sent to LCIDC for fighting each other but were  · \ninexplicably assigned to share a cell together upon arrival at LCIDC.  Jn addition, youths N.N. \nand 0. 0. independently told us that they were sharing a cell despite a conflict between them. \nBoth youths had repeatedly asked staff to separate them but no action had been taken. \nWe f~dthat the lack of an adequate classification system at LCJDC places youth at an \n\nunacceptably high risk ofvictimization, does not keep youth reasonably safe, and is therefore \n\nunconstitutional. \n\n5.  LCJDC lacks adeauate medical and mental health care. \nReasonable protection of confined youths' physicai and mental safety requires adequate \n\nmedical treatment, mental health treatment and 5\\licide prevention measures.  See Youngberg, \n\n457 U.S. at 323-24 & 323 n.30; Morales. 364 F. Supp. at 175.  Apprppriate care for youths' . \n\n·mental health needs is as important as caring'for their medical needs.  Gates y. Cook. 376 F. 3d \n323, 332-33 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Partridge v. Two Unknown Police Officers of City of \nHouston. Texas, 791 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir. 1986)). Further, providing only medication to \nyouth with psychiatric disabiiities, in the absence of additional or other mental health services, \nviolates their constitutional rights.  Gates, 376 F. 3d at 335 (holding that the confmement of \ninmates with severe mental illness on Mississippi's death raw with no mental health care other  · \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 10 of 30 PageiD #: 18 . \n. -10­\nthan medication was \"grossly inadequate\" and constituted deliberate indifference in violation of \nthe Eighth Amendment).  · \nWhile we did not include experts in medical and mental health services in our \ninvestigatory tour, the obvious dearth ofeven the most basic medical and mental health care at \nLCJDC leads us to conclude that the constitutional rights ofdetained youth to adequate medical \nand mental health care are being violated.· \na. \t LCJDC provides inadequate medical screenings and fails to seek \nappropriate medical treatment, placing youth at significant risk of \nserious harm. \nBy failing to properly screen youth for medical conditions, LCJDC remains deliberately \nindifferent to potentially serious harm. In accordance with generally accepted juvenile justice \nstandards, Mississippi state law requires that youth undergo a health screening upon admission to \na juvenile detention center, within one hour or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, in order \nto obtain information about the juvenile's mental health, suicide risk, alcohol and other drug use \nand abuse, physical health, aggressive behavior, family relations, peer relations, social skills, \neducational status, and vocational.status. ·See Miss. Code Alm. § 43-21-3 21.  This statutory \nrequirement is acknowledged in LCJDC' s manual, but documentation showed that facility staff \nmembers do not comply with this legal requirement  · \nDocumentation purported to show that the 13 youth detair\\ed at the time of our \ninvestigation toui had been screened in compliance with State law with respect to physical \nhealth.  However, upon close examination, that same documentation noted that four youth \nentered the facility.at 12:23 p.m. on November 10, 2009 and that medical screening for each of \nthe four youth was also completed at 12:23 p.m. that same day.  It is not credible that all four \nyouth were admitted and medically screened within the space of one minute. \nWe found no evide_nce that LCJDC' s officers are trained by medical professionals on \nhow to conduct initial medical screenings.  Generally accepted professional standards require \nthat detention officers receive training-froin a health authority on conducting initial medical \nscreenings of youth.  Without proper medical screening by appropriately qualified staff, youth \nare subjected to a high risk that medical or mental health problems will be undetected and \n. unaddressed at the facility.  · \nDuring individual interviews; our experts specifically noticed two youths, P.P. and Q.Q., \nwho exhibited behaviors consistent with neurological impairments (e.g., Traumatic Brain Injury, \ntic disorders) and/or other health issues.  The records for these two youths did not document \nthese explicit behaviors, and when we asked the facility director about the youths' medical \nstatus, he stated he had not noticed these signs.  Significantly, P.P. had been detained at LCJDC \non multiple occasions without any treatment for the possible disability. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 11 of 30 PageiD #: 19 \n-11­\nBecause there are no medical personnel on-site, facility policy requires staff to take youth \n. to see a physician if a medical. screening indicates a need for emergency care or ifa parent, \nguardian, or youth court designee makes a written request for medical care.  We found that, \ninstead, untralned custody ·officers often provide basic medical care and improperly make \ndecisions on treatment.  For example: \n• \t InMarch 2008, R.R. began vomiting in her room.  Custody officers offered an over· \nthe-counter stomach medication to the resident, but she refuSed.  No other medical \naction was taken. ·  · \n• \t In June 2008, S.S. reported to a detention officer that he fell in his room and \ndislodged his tooth.  The detention officer and another staff member looked in S. S. 's \nmouth and reported that \"you could see that he pull( ed] the tooth out and he was \nOK.\"  No further action was taken. \n• \t In December 2008, T.T. complained to facility staff that he was having chest pains. \nThe youth was takillg lithium, a psychoactive drug often used for the treatment of \nbipolar disorder.  Like many psychoactive drugs, lithium may reach dangerously \ntoxic levels ifnot appropriately monitored by a medical professional and has a . \nnumber of potentially serious adverse side effects.  We could find no evidence that \nE.U. was examined by a medical professional following his complaint of.c h\t e.s t pai.n .\n• \t In July' 2009, U.U. complained that his stomach was upset on the same day that his \nmother called and advised the facility that U.U. did not have his asthma medication. \nThe next day, when U.U. complained ofchest pain and began throwing up blood, a \ncustody officer reviewed the Unit log and noted that no action had been taken the \nprevious day regarding the youth's illness. U.U. was then taken to the hospital by \ncustody staff and diagnosed with bronchitis. \n• \t InMay 2010, a juvenile at the facility was suffering from tooth pain and could not get \nattention from a detention officer until he began banging on the cell door:  One ofthe \ndetention officers entered the cell and beat the youth until the juvenile was wailing \nand crying.  The youth did not receive medical attention for the tooth. \nb. \t LCJDC is deliberately indifferent to suicide risks and the related \nserious mental health needs ofyouth, placing them at significant risk \nof serious harm. \nAmong the most dangerous practices at LCJDC is the facility's failure to meaningfully \nscreen or monitor potentially suicidal youth.  Youth at great risk ofharm are exposed to  · \nconditions that are not reasonably safe and are therefore unconstitutional. \nIn order to provide reasonable safety to potentially suicidal youth, all youth placed on \n\nsuicide precautioiJ,S must be regularly monitored by mental health professionals~ Any staff \n\nperson may place a youth on suicide precautions initially, but the precautions should only be \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05112115 12 of 30 PageiD #: 20 \n-12­\nremoved following an assessment by a mental health professional. At LCJPC, if a youth's \nscreening indicates a need for additional assessment, staffmembers are supposed to schedule an \n.appointment with the local mental health clinic and transport the youth to the clinic.  This does \nnot occur.  Indeed, records demonstrate instances where youth who are placed on suicide \nprecautions by staff are never assessed by mental health professionals at any time during their \ndetention.  · \nDetention staff should also provide consistent monitoring ofyouth on suicide precautions \nto observe behavior and ensure the youth's safety and welfare.  LCJDC does not regularly  · \nmonitor youth wjrile they are on suicide precautions, and it is unclear who decides when youth \nmay be removed from precautions.  For example:  · \n• \t In May 2008, V.V. was discovered tying a sheet around a pipe in his cell in an \nattempt to commit suicide.  Detention staff monitored the youth and required him to \nwear only a paper gown.  However, despite his suicidal behavior, no mental health \nprofessional ever assessed or treated V.V.. \n• \t In June 2008, an officer bribed W.W. and X.X. to keep them quiet about an attempted \nsuicide.  W.W. reportedly knocked on her cell door continuously during X.X's \nattempted suicide in an effort to get the attention ofstaff but was ignored by the two \nofficers on duty, one ofwhom (\"Officer 1\") was smoking a cigarette.  The officers \ncontinued to ignore W.W. until they heard her screaming.  Staff discovered that X.X. \nhad tied a blanket tightly around her neck and a railitig on the .ceiling.  After the noose \nwas removed by staff, Officer 1 told the·two youths not to tell anyone about the \nincident, and allowed them to spend several hours eating snacks and playing · \ncomputer games.  Officer 1 also told the other officer not to tell anyone about the \nincident, especially the director.  The incident was eventually reported and. \n· investigated.  Despite the facility director's recommendation that Officer 1 be \nterminated, Officer !remains at LCJDC. \n• \t In September 2008, Y.Y. began banging his head against the cell door and tied his \nuniform shirt around his neck.  Y.Y. 's cellmate notified two detention officers who \nthen entered the cell, removed the shirt, and placed Y.Y. in mechanical restraints. \nThe officers later returned to the cell after. Y.Y. managed to tie a sheet around'his \nneck despite the restraints.  The officers then removed the restraints, \"stripped\" Y.Y., \nplaced him in a paper gown, and re-applied mechailical restraints.  Y.Y. then \nattempted to tie the paper gown around his neck and stuffed tissue in his nose and \nmouth.  The incident report concludes by stating that the officers took away both the \ngown and the tissue.  No further action was taken. \nz.z: \n• . A March 2009 mental health assessment of  described him as \"suicidal and \npsychotic\" and in need of \"immediate attention.\"  He was placed in a paper gown and \nput on suicide watch after the. assessment.  Five days later, though still on suicide \nprecautions, Z.Z. was observed in full clothing after staff returned his clothing in \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1·Filed: 05/12/15 13 of 30 PageiD #: 21 \n-13. \nviolation ofa facility directiv~. It is unclear when or ifZ.Z. was ever removed from. \nsuicide watch during his 18-day detention at LCJDC. \n• \t In May 2009,A.B. was observed in his room crying, with a tom blal)ket tied tightly \naround his neck.  Detention staff removed the blal)ket and placed A.B. in a suicide \ngown, but he was not assessed by a mental health professional until three days later. \nA suicide watch Jog purportedly showed that the youth was observed by detention \nstaff every four minutes while on suicide watch, but the observational times and \ndetention officer's initials were typed in for the entire shift, calling into question the \nveracity ofthe observations.  Given the physical set-up ofthe facility, it i.s highly \nunlikely that the detention. officer could have observed A.B. as reported on the suicide \nwatch Jog and typed in the information every four minutes.  · \n• \t In September 2009, A. C. was placed on suiCide watch after a local mental health \nprofessional determined that he e;cpi'essed suicidal ideations, intent to self liarm, and \nauditory hallucinations.  The suicide watch log indicates that a detention officer \nobserved A.C. every four minutes.  The veracity ofthe observations is dubious, \nhowever, given that the times and officer's initials are all typed. \nFinally, suicide hazards remain in youth cells.  While the County has removed exposed· · \nmetal piping iri many of the cells, some protrusions and tying offpoints still remain.  In sum, \nLCJDC's grossly inadeq~te suicide prevention practices violate youths' constitutional rights to \nl¢equate safety. and adequate mental health care, and place these youths at life-threatening risk. \n6.  LCJDC's fails to provide adequate programming. \nYouth at LCJDC have a constitutional right to adequate treatment. Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 323; Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130,1146-55 (D. Miss. 1977) (holding tbatjuverule \nfacility must provide adequate treatment, including proper behavior management and recreation \nprograms, among others).  That right is abrogated by LCJDC 's failure to provide adequate \nprogramming and behavior management.systems.  In order to provide constitutional care, \njuvenile justice facilities must provide rehabilitation programming and treatment while youth are \nconfmed.  Thus, generally accepted professional standards require that juvenile justice facilities \nprovide education, recreation, and meaningfUl activities such as group and individual therapy, \nsocial skills training, and oth~programming.  LCJDC fails to provide these services, and the \nlack ofstructure and meaningful programming activity is not only violating the youths' rights but \nis predictably resulting in behavior problems .. \nYouth at LCJDC spend an inordinate amount oftime playing cards or dominos while in \nthe small dayroom or while locked in their cells.  Besides schooling, the only regularly scheduled \nactivity for youth is a two-hour arts and crafts class held in the evenings twice per week.  On \nweekends, youth are allowed to watch television ifthey have behaved during the week and may \nattend religious programming on Sundays.  However, youth spend most weekend time locked in \ntheir cells.  Furthermore, recreational logs indicated long gaps between opportunities for youth to \nengage in large muscle exerCise.  Although there is a small outdoor recreation yard outfitted with \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12115 14 of 30 PageiD #: 22 \n- 14­\na basketball hoop, it appears to be rarely used and was not used during our November 2009 tour. \nDuring an interview, youth A.D. stated that he had been permitted outside for recreation only \ntwice during his 3 6-day period of detention.  Without activities to keep youths mentally and \n. physically occupied, youth at LCJDC create their own activities, including beating and kicking \nwalls and doors, yelling, cursing, picking fights, and other negative behavior. \nThe problems resulting from the paucity ofprogramming activity are exacerbated by the \nlack of a behavior management program at LCJDC.  Children and adolescents typically lack \nstrong impulse control, and youths at juvenile detention facilities are often particularly affected \nby their lack of impulse control and lack of an ability to make good choices to control their \nbehavior.  Therefore, it is critical that a juvenile facility have in place a behavior management \nsystem that provides immediate, consistent, and tangible reinforcement of desired behaviors. \nAlthough LCJDC once purchased a behavior management system manual, it was never used. \nAccording to staff, LCJDC officials delayed implementing the system because they expected the \nfacility to move to a new building.  · \nWe fmd that LCJDC's failure to provide adequate programming activity-regardless of \nthe facility's physical limitations-contributes to increased risk of suicide, violence and \nexcessive discipline and violates the youths' constitutional rights. \n7.  LCJDC fails to provide adequate staffing levels for supervision of youth. \nSome of the above described problems appear to have resulted from inadequate staffing. \nLCJDC' s serious deficiencies in staffing places youth at risk of harm because of reduced \naccountability, overreliance on restraints, inadequate youth supervision, and inadequate suicide \nprevention practices.  This deficiency contributes to violations of youths' constitutional rights to. \nreasonably safe conditions of confmement. See Youngberg. 457 U.S. at 324. \na\nLCJDC operates with three detention officers for  population of up to twenty-four \nyouths of both genders.  The facility has no means to electronically monitor youth in their rooms \nin addition to visual checks.  With two floors and two control rooms, the current staffing pattern \nis inadequate for LCJDC, particularly when one or more youths are placed on suicide watch, \n8.  LCJDC fails to provide youth a reasonably safe living environment. \nLCJDC 's physical enviromnent poses an unreasonable risk to the safety and welfare of \ndetained youths.  The Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause requires juvenile justice  · \nfacilities to provide youth with conditions of reasonable care and safety. Youngberg. <I-57 U.S. at \n324.  LCJDC 's failure to adequately address the risk of the spread of infectious diseases, coupled \nwith its inadequate fire safety practices, exposes youths detained there to great risks. \nCells are extremely dirty, contain tom mattresses, and the toilets in the cells were not \n\nadequately cleaned.  The showers were similarly filthy; such environmental considerations are \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/1~ 15 of 30 PageiD #: 23 \n- 15­\ncritical in preventing the spread of infectious agents such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus\n5 \t . \naureus (\"MRSA\"). \t . \nLCJDC's fJie safety and emergency planning is also inadequate and exposes both youth \nand staff to an unnecessarily high risk ofharm, including death.  Documentation showed that \nalthough the facility conducts monthly flre drills, the facility's plan for evacuating youth and \nstaff is dangerous.  LCJDC' s plan is to evacuate everyone to a small outdoor recreation area that \nis directly adjacent to the detention area and is enclosed with tall brick walls.  This would be \ndangerous in the event of a fJie.  LCJDC also fails to have a plan for. evacuation in the event of a \ntomado or other emergency. \n9. \t LCJDC violates the due process rights of youth by failing to provide a \ngrievance system. \nA grievance system provides cktained youth with a mechanism to resolve disputes \nregarding their detention.  Given the arbitrary discipline process and the other deflciencies noted \nin this letter, the absence ofa grievance process contributes to the unconstitutional conditions in · \nthe facility.  LCJDC does not provide any forms for f).ling grievances or any confidential means \nfor filing grievances, such as a locked drop box.  According to the facility manual, the grievance \nprocess consists of a juvenile writing a statement of his or her grievance and handing that \n·statement to the shift supervisor.  The shift supervisor then submits the statement to the assistant \ndirector, who then conveys it to the facility director.  There is nothing confldential about any  · \naspect of this process. \nYouth at LCJDC have a tight to flle grievances with the facility regarding their treatment, \n. as well as a fight not to be punished for using the grievance system. See Decker v. McDona!Q, \nNo. 5:09 Civ. 27, 2CHO WL 1424322, *15 (E.D.Tex. Jan. 11, 2010) (noting that the law is well \nestablished that prison officials may not retaliate against an inmate who exercises his right of \naccess to the courts or·use of the grievance system); see also):Iasan v.

At the time of our tour, the director \n. ofLCJDC had not received a grievance since October 2005-a period of more than four years. \nThe fact that no grievances have been received by the director since October 2005 is testament to \n•  MRSA is a highly contagious bacteria commonly found in institutional settings that is resistant to certain \nantibiotics, including methicillin.

We find that LCJDC' s grievance process is a contribution factor \nto unconstitutional conditions. \nB. \t YOUTHS' RIGHTS TO ADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ARE BEING \nVIOLATED AT LCJDC \nLCJDC consistently fails to provide youth with adequate general education serviees. \nAlthough the County has asserted that complying with the law is difficult due to the transient \nnature of the youth population and limited resources, these challenges are not unique to this \nfacility and do not excuse the County from providing proper educational services to detained \nyouth.  Specifically, Mississippi state law requires that youth receive a minimum of five hours of \neducational instruction each weekday during the academic year. Miss. Code Ann. § 37-13-91(d), . \nas amended. \nThe d!'llrlal of education services to detained youth that are comparable to those provided \nby the State to non-detained youth violates due process and equal protection rights.  Plyler v. \nDoe, 457 U.S. 202, 224 (1982) (deprivation ofbasic educational  must be rationally \n~ervices \nrelated to a substantial goal of the state); Donnell C. v. lllinois State Bd. ofEduc., 829 F. Supp. \n1016, 1018-19 (N.D. ill. 1993) (a juvenile facility's denial qf education services and provision of \neducation services inferior to those of non-detained youth violated due process and equal \nprotection claims. of youth at the facility) .. In cases discussing the provision of education to \ndetained youth, courts have recognized the e~sential function of education.  See,~ Morgan v. \nSproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130, 1150-51 (D. Miss. 1977) (holding that juvenile facility must provide \nsufficient education and vocational training to residents in order to reduce recidivism and \npromote successful reintegration into society).  · \nFurthermore, students with disabilities have federal statutory rights to special education \nservices under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400­\n1482.  See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 310 (i988) (noting that the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, as amended by IDEA;\"confers .upon disabled students an \nenforceable substantive right to public education in participating States\"). IDEA requires states \nthat accept federal funds to provide educational services to all children with disabilities between \nthe ages ofthree and, twenty-one years, even if the children have been silspended or expelled \nfrom school.  20 U.S. C. § 1412(a)(1)(A).  Accordingly, the State must provide such services to \nyouth in juvenile justice facilities.  See id. (conditioning funds on the availability of services to \n\"all children with disabilities\"); 34 C.F.R. § 300.2(b)(l)(iv) (applying IDEA requirements to \"all \npolitical subdivisions of the State that are involved in the education of children with disabilities, \nincluding ... State and local juvenlle and adult correctional facilities\"); see also Alexander S. By \nand Through Bowers v. Boyd, 876 F. Supp. 773, 788 (D.S.C. 1995) (finding IDEA applicable to \nschool-age detainees injuvenile detention facilities).  IDEA also requires schools to have \nprocedures for identifYing and testing students with disabilities.  34 C.F.R. § 300.111(a)(l)(i). \nSection 504 ofthe.Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section 504\"), 29 U.S. C. § 794, similarly \nobligates the State to provide youth conftned in its institutions with educational services.  Section \n504 requires that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 17 of 30 PageiD #: 25 \n-17­\ndefined in section 705(20) ofthis title, shall, solely by reason ofher or his disability, be excluded \nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \nAlthough the County is obligated to provide free and appropriate education to qualified \nstudents with disabilities under both the IDJ;!A and Section 504, special education services are \nvirtually non-existent at LCJDC.  The facility does not appropriately collect and analyze \nacademic and behavioral data for students.  Because ofthis, students at LCJDC often do not \nreceive appropriate special education services as required by IDEA.  Specifically, LCJDC is \nnoncompliant with IDEA with respect to:  1) Child Find (see infra, below); 2) general education \ninterventions; 3) Individual Education Programs (\"IEPs''); 4) access to the general education \ncurriculum for students receiving special education services; 5) behavioral supports; 6) sta:ffmg; · \nand 7) transition services. \n1. \t LCJOC violates the due process and equal protection rights of youth \nconfined there by failing to provide them with appropriate general \neducational services. \nYouth at LCJDC do not receive adequ~;~te educationar:services during detention, in \nviolation oftheir equal protectim:i and due process rights.  Under State law, youths are entitled to \na minimum of five hours ofeducational instruction each weekday during the academic year, \nMiss. Code Ann. § 37-13-91(d), as amended.  Students at LCJDC reported receiving \ninstructional class orily Monday througli Wednesday until the week of our November 2009 to.ur. \nBeginning with the week ofour tour, students and staff stated that instruction occurs Monday \n.through Thursday, with Friday reserved for television or movies.  Youth detained at LCJDC are \nnot receiving educational services consistent with the State's mandatory minimum of 5 hours \neach weekday: \nLCJDC fails to maintain any educational records and coursework does not align with that \nrequired for a student in the connnunity to obtain a high school diploma. ·n uring classroom \nobservation, one female student in her mid-teens was seen completing a worksheet reviewing \nelementary addition (e.g., 2 +3 =5).  Such instruction does not allow students to access grade­\nlevel curriculum available to non-detained youth.  Additional inadequacies ofLCJDC's general \neducational services are mentioned throughout the discussion of speCial educational services \nbelow. \n2. \t LCJOC violates federal law by failing to provide adequate Child Find · \nprocedures. \nIDEA requires that the State have in effect policies and procedures to identifY, locate, and \nevaluate youth suspected ofhaving a qualifYing disability that would entitle them to special \neducation services.  34 C.P.R. 71 § 300.11l(a)(l)(i). This is known as \"Child Find.~' Child Find \ncan sometimes be as simple as asking a detained youth whether he or she has ever received \n· special education services at the connnunity school. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 18 of 30 PageiD #: 26 \n- 1&­\nAlthough a structured intake assessment form exists at LCJDC, Child Find is \nsignificantly limited by inadequate or non-existent assessments and faulty scoring.  LCJDC's \nintake forms do not capture data regarding special education status or history.  Rather, the basic \nscreening forms are limited to evaluating the educational and vocational status of youths.  In our \nindividual interviews, we identified two youths, A.B. and A.F., who had previously received \n. special education services elsewhere but had not been identified by LCJDC as possibly having a \ndisability entitling them to special education services.  LCJDC 's intake forms do not capture data \nregarding special education status or history necessary for Child Find. \nEven ifan assessment form util~es popular evaluative tools, such as the Massachusetts \n\nYouth Screening Instrument Version 2 (\"MAYSI-2'') used by LCJDC, such tools are only \n\neffective for Child Find ifproperly analyzed and disseminated in a timely fashion.  The current \n\n·evaluative tools fail to satisfy these criteria.  Basic scoring of intake assessments is not properly \ncompleted, and data: is not used to properly guide instructional accommodations.  After a student \ncompletes.a basic screening, LCJDC scores the assessments using percentages and not grade \nlevel.  However, given the nature and purpose of these forms, reporting the assessment as a \npercentage score is ineffective in guiding the teacher towards determining whether special \neducation modifications are necessary.  Moreover, score forms based on the assessments are only \ncompleted w)len a student is exiting the facility.  Accordingly, even ifthe assessments were \nscored in a manner that would allow ):he teacher to make proper adjustments to a youth's \ncurriculum or to evaluate a youth for special education services, the data would be unavailable \nfor this purpose until the student has left the facility.  LCJDC 's intake and.screening procedures, \ntherefore, inadequately assist in identifying students in need of special education and related \nservices. \n3. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide general instructional and \nevaluatjve interventions. \nPrior to evaluation of a student for special education, IDEA requires that the State review \ndata-based documentation of the student's progress and consider whether the student is being \nprovided appropriate instruction by a highly qualified teacher.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.309(b)(l)-(2). \nThe State must further document the student's behavior in that student's learning environment, \nincluding the regular classroom setting.  · \nThere is no evidence that LCJDC engages in academic or behavioral pre-referral/general \neducation interventions, dafa collection, or observations.  Both academic and behavioral pre­\nreferral/general education interventions shauld·include specific methods for data collection in \norder to objectively evaluate student progress and the possible need for special education \nservices.  LCJDC's data collection processes are inadequate.  This incomplete data is \nparticularly troubling for students at the warning level for suicidal ideation, traumatic \nexperiences, or anger.  These youths may be entitled to special education services, but they are \nnot being identified at LCJDC.  During our tour, 6 of the 13 youths tested at the warning level on \nthe facility's tests but were not receiving any special education services. \n•. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 19 of 30 PageiD #: 27 \n- 19­\n4. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide Individualized Education \nPrograms for youth in need of special education services. \nIDEA requires that each student with a disability have an Individualized Education \nProgram (\"IEP\") to ensure that the student receives adequate special education services.  34 \nC.P.R. 71 § 300.323(a).  No IEPs were available during our tour, and although several IEPs were \nprovided post-tour, none were for students present at the facility during our visit.  During our \ntour, we discovered a student with special needs who had been housed at LCJDC for 36 days \nwith no IEP.  This is a violation ofIDEA. \nIDEA also requires that LCJDC take reasonable steps to promptly obtain a youth's \nrecords, including IEPs or documents relating to,a youth's special education status, from the \nprevious public agency in which the child was enrolled.  34 C.P.R. 71 § 300.323(g)(l).  LCIDC \nwas uoable to produce educational records for any student enrolled at the time ofour tour, and \nstaff stated that IEPs are often received after a youth has already left the facility.  No data \nconcerning student academic and behaviorallEP goals was available while on site, nor was there· \nany indication that parents/guar(lians and IEP team members had met regarding any student.  The \n11bsence ofthis.data is a gross violation of IDEA. \nIn addition, IDEA requires that teachers implement each child's IEP, including specific \naccommodations, modifications, and supports.  34 C.F.R. 7l § 300.323(c)(2). No instructional \nadaptations were observed at LCIDC nor were any adaptations listed on lesson plans.  Moreover, \nlesson plans were incomplete, there was no evidence of academic or behavioral-related record \nkeeping, and lesson plans did not differentiate assignments for stu(lents at various levels.  The \ninadequacy of lesson plans and instructional adaptati,ons may be partly attribu~d to the failure to \n.provide the teacher with IEPs until after a youth has left the facility.  Without an IEP, it is \nimpossibl~ for the teacher to properly instruct students according to their individual needs as is \nrequired under IDEA. \nLCIDC's failure to maintain IEPs violates several federal requirements, notably that: \n1) adequate records are not obtained at intake or sent out at exit from LCJDC; 2) IEPs are not \ndeveloped, reviewed, or reevaluated in accordance with federal law; 3) there is a high risk of \nin~onsistencies between· previous and current levels of special education service for youths; \n4) there is a lack of parent/guardian and IEP team signatures; 5) there is a lack ofiEP \nimplementation and data collection; and 6) there is a possible lack ofrelationship between the \ndisability of an individual youth and the IEP goals.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.320(a)(2)(i-ii). \n,{ \n5. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide access to the general \neducation curriculum for youth in need of special education services. \nLCIDC's common practice of segregating youths for discipline problems during school· \nfails to comply with IDEA's requirement that LCIDC provide comprehensive educational \nservices to students.  34 C.F.R. 71 § 300.304(b)(l)~  Specifically, no education services are \navailable to students who are sent to their cells for discipline problems.  When a student \nmisbehaves, LCIDC routinely returns the youth to his/her cell for the remainder of the day with \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 20 of 30 PageiD #: 28 \n-20­\nno school work, even when the youth's behavior has improved.  This is a patent violation of \nIDEA.  During our tour, 13-year-old youth A.H. was in his cell without any schoolwork for the \nentire school day because he had refused to do schoolwork in the classroom.  Our interview with \nR.S. revealed a calm and compliant youth who should have been returned to the classroom. \nPursuant to federal Jaw, educational services should be comprehensive so as to enable youths to \ncontinue to participate in the general education curriculum even ifthey must be temporarily \nsegregated.  Where safety or other penalogical interests are involved, LCJDC should make \nindividualized adaptations and return tlie student to class as qilickly as safely possible. \n6. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide adequate behavioral \nsupports for youth. \nLCJDC fails to provide positive behavioral interventions, supports and other strategies to \naddress negative behavior, as required by IDEA.  34 C.P.R. 71. § 309.324(a)(2)(i). Positive \nbehavioral interventions and supports include interventions for youth at the facility level, \nsecondary interVentions for youth with additional needs, and tertiary interventions for youth who \nrequire individualized behavioral interventions. \nAlthough LCJDC employs a school-wide social skills curriculum, the primary approach \nto behfivioral problems is reactive.  As noted above, LCJDC inappropriately segregates students \niri cells for the remainder ofthe school day rather than correcting problematic behavior in the \nclassroom.  Segregation is inconsistent with IDEA, and there is no evidence that a youth's \ndisability is considered when students are sent back to their cells or in the administration of \nconsequences'for behavioral misconduct.  During our tour, we observed an announcement \nstating:  \"Any juvenile found to be disruptive to the orderly running ofthis facility will be \nrecommended to 90 days detention or training school.\"  Such reactive and sporadic disciplinary \nmeasures fail to adequately remedy or deter problematic behavior and are particularly \ninappropriate for youth with disabilities.  Two out ofseven students we interviewed regarding \neducation reported that no reinforcement was provided'as an incentive for positive behavior. \nMoreover, no rul.es or consequences were posted in the classroom as guideiines for behavior.  · \nPerhaps the most egregiouS concern regarding LCJDC's use of segregation is the failure \nto maintain any data regarding youth segregation; No data is available regarding length oftyne \nor frequency of segregation; reason for segregation; youth behavior while segregated; or  , ' \nguidelines for use ofsegregation.  Without such data, \"manifestation determination\" hearings \ncannot occur.6 Further, failing to chronicle segregation use prevents develop!Ilent of, and  · \nimplementation of, modifications to general education interventions and behavior intervention \nplans (\"BIPs\").  IDEA requires that LCJDC conduct a manifest determination when it decides to \nchange the placement ofa student with disabilities because of that student's violation ofthe code \n6  Manifestation detennination hearings are employed when a student who receives special education services \nis considered for suspension, expulsion or any alternative placement due to some behavioral concern. The process is · \nused to detennine if the actions that resulted in the consideration of some disciplinary action against the student \nwere manifestations ofthe student's disability. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 21 of 30 PageiD #: 29 \n- 21 ­\nof conduct.  LCJDC's failure to log this data regarding youth segregation is a patent violation of \nIDEA. \ntwo \nBased on our review ofteacher reports, it appears that students who missed up to \ndays of school per week were allowed to watch movies on Fridays as incentive for positive \nbehavior.  This reward system is problematic because it disengages students from instruction \nduring the movies and permits an excessive number of absences.  LCJDC' s system to address \nstudent behavior is ineffective and places youth with disabilities at a significant disadvantage for \nmaintaining access to the general education curriculum.  More specific behavioral \nreinforcements should be implemented throughout each day as part of a facility behavior \n·management prograril. \t · \nTo adequately address student behavior, LCJDC should implement secondary behavioral \ninterventions for youth who do not need individual programs but need support beyond the \nfacility plan.  Under IDEA! when a youth's \"behavior impedes the child's learning or that of \nuse \nothers, consider the  of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to \naddress that behavior,\" 34 C.P.R. 71 § 300.324(a)(2)(i).  An effective behavioral intervention \nplan is an intervention that is designed to promote  pro-social student behayior. \npo~itive; \n·  Pursuant to IDEA, behavior that is a manifestation of a disability should result in a \nfunctional behavior assessment and the development or modification of the current behavior \nintervention plan.  Teachers and staff should be held accountable for consistently and accurately \nas \nevaluating student behavior, recording data, and using student behavioral data,  per \nindividualized programs.  At LCJDC, no evidence of any functional behavior assessment or \nindividual behavior pians exists.  Further, it is not apparent that teachers and staff are held \naccountable for consistently and accurately evaluating student  recording data, and . \nbe~avior, \nusing student behavioral data. \n7. \t LCJDC violates federal law by failing to provide adequate educational \nstaffing for youth in need of special education services. \nAlthough the student-teacher ratio at the time ofour tour ofLCJDC was acceptable at 13 \nstudents per '1 teacher, the current teacher is neither appropriately licensed nor· qualified, in \nviolation of IDEA.  Additional teachers who are licensed and qualified are needed to ineet the \nrequirements set forth in IDEA.  A staffing plan should be devised and implemented based on \nthese current needs, and in light offederal requirements.  · \n8. \t LCJDC :violates federal law by failing to provide adeg nate trimsition services \nfor youth in need of special education services. \nAlthough IDEA requires that facilities provide transitional services, none exis~ at LCJDC. \nIDEA includes two major components in its def!hitionofthe group of activities labeled as  · \n.''transition services.\"  First, transition services should be located within a results-oriented process \nfocused on preparing students for a fruitful life outside ofthe.school context.  Second, the \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 22 of 30 PageiD #: 30 \n-22­\ntransition services that a given student receives should be based on the individualized needs of \nthat student. \nVocational technology courses may help provide transitional services for youths.  We \nreviewed a LCJDC memorandum about a vocational technology program that was supposedly \nimplemented in Fall2009.  The curricula listed classes in automechanics and repair, brick \nmasonry, wood shop, refrigeration and air conditioning; culinary instructions, cosmetology, and \ncomputer technology.  In rea,lity, however, no vocational education courses exist at the facility. \nIfthe facility· had vocational programs, they would need to be offered in accordance with \ntransition services outlined in a student's IEP.  Since there were no IEPs available, it is unclear \nwhetht:r some students have vocational education listed on their IEPs. \nAn additional concern regarding transition services is the lack of comprehei).sive and \nfarina! information concerning academic progress, which is necessary to report back to a \nstudent's home school upon exiting the facility.  Although general transition procedures were \nprovided, the lack of appropriate education and special education services, as well as academic \nand behavioral data, makes communication of youth progress impossible except for very general \nstatements.  · \nV. REMEDJM, MEASURES \nIn order to rectify the identified deficiencies and protect the constitutional and federal \nat \nstatutory rights ofyouth confmed  Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center, the County \nshould implement the minimal remedial measures set forth below.  Implementation of the  . \nmeasures should comply with generaily accepted professional standards in order to ensure that \nyouths are adequately treated, protected from harm, and provided with appropriate educational \n· services. \nA.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \n1.  Restraints \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that restraints never be used to punish \nyouth.  Every application ofmechanical restraints or use offorce- including handcuffs, leg \nshackles, belly chains, or other such restraints - should be fully documented, including the \ncircumstances leading to the application, effbrts used to de-escalate the situation, the specific \nmanner or technique in which force was applied, and the duration of the incident.  The current \nfacility practice of restraining residents to the bed should be immediately stopped. Ai:ly \nrestrained juvenile should be constantly observed by staff to ensure safety. \nLCJDC should develop and implement written policies and procedures that establish a \ngraduated set ofinterventions that avoid the use of physical force or mechanical restraints. \nGenerally accepted practices for juvenile justice facilities require that physical force be used by \nstaff only in exceptional circumstances when all other pro-active, non-physical behavior \nmanagement techniques have been tinsuccessful and the youth presents a danger tci himself or \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 23 of 30 PageiD #: 31 \n-23­\nothers.  In the limited circumstances when physical force is appropriate, staff should employ only \nthe minimum amount necessary to stabilize the situation and protect the safety ofthe involved \njuvenile or others..  Therefore, detention staff should be trained in non-physical, verbal \ninterventions to de-escalate potential aggression from youth. \nYouth who have been subject to force or mechanical restraints should be assessed by a \nmedical professional following the incident regardless of whether there is a visible injury or the \nyouth denies any injury.  Subsequently, management should conduct a formal review ofthe \nincident to determine whether staff acted appropriately.  The post-incident review should also be \nutilized to identify any training needs and debrief staff on how to avoid simi!ar incidents through \nde\"escalation. \n2.  Disciplinary Due Process \nYouth detained at juvenile justice facilities have a right to due process protections in the \nevent that they are subjected to discipline or punishment.  LCJDC should establish a disciplinary \nsystem, including notification to all youth ofthe· facility rules, the consequenlies for violating \nthose.rules, and their rights ifthey are charged with a rule violation.  Youth should receive \ninstruction on the facility rules and the disciplinary prOCI:lBS during orientation.  This information \nshould also be provided in a facility handbook provided to each youth during orientation and \nshould be displayed in the youths' living and program areas.  Ifa youth is charged with a \nviolation, minimally adequate due process protections should include:  1) the provision ofwritten \nnotice of the alleged violation to the detainee/youthlresident at least 24 hours prior to a hearing; \n·\t2) a written statement by the fact-finder(s) as to the evidence relied upon and the reaso;ms for the \ndisciplinary action taken; and, 3) unless it interferes with institutional safety, the youth should \nhave the opportunity to present witnesses and evidence at the hearing.  ·  · \nAdministrative and disciplinary segregation should be used appropriately. \nAdnlinistrative segregation should only be used as an emergency measure to control a youth \nwhose behavior poses an immediate risk of harm to himself or others or who requires protective \ncustody, either at the youth's request or the facility's assessment.  Youths who are placed in \nadministrative segregation for behavioral reasons should be removed from segregation as soon as \ntheir behavior no longer poses an immediate risk ofhann to themselves or others.  Youths placed \nin administrative segregation for behavioral reasons should also be provided with a due process \n· hearing every 24 hours any time their segregation exceeds 24 hours.  Disciplinary segregation \nshould only be used as a sanction for a major rule violation, and each youth should receive a due \nprocess hearing prior to being sent to disciplinary segregation.  No youth should be placed in \nsegregation for longer than three consecutive days except for protective custody purposes. \n~.  Renorting & Investigating Abuse \nLCJDC should adopt and implement a zero-tolerance policy for staff abuse of youths, aud \n\nstaff should be consistently held accmintable when policy violations occur.  Serious incidents, \n\nallegations ofabuse, and allegations of staff misconduct should be adequately and timely \n\ninvestigated by neutral investigators with no involvement or interest in the underlying event. \n\n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 24 of 30 PageiD #: 32 \n• 24. \n· Staff conducting these investigations should receive adequate competency-based training on the \ninvestigation process, which should be completed in a timely fashion and no later than 30 days \nafter an incident or allegation.  In the rare cases where an exception to this time frame is \nw,arranted, the exception should be documented and not granted oh the basis ofinadequate \ninvestigator staffing.  LCJDC should also develop and implement a Written process to report \nresident's allegations of staff abuse to the State as mandated reporters. \n4.  Classification \nLCJDC should develop a written classification policy tl!at takes into account: \n1) separation of older residents from younger residents; 2) separation of males from females; \n3) separation of violent from non-violent yquth; 4) maturity; 5) presence of mental or physical \ndisabilities; 6) suicide risk; 7) offense; and 8) case-specific information about youth who should \n. be separated from each other.  The policy should address plans to protect youth who have been \nvictimized at the facility or who have concerns about their safety. \n'  ' \n5.  Medical ·and Mental Health Care \na.  Screenings and Treatment \nIn order to comply with generally accepted professional standards to provide adequate \nhealth care services to youths in need of medical and mental health care attention, LCJDC should \nprovide adequate, comprehensive, and reliable screening and assessment services to identify \nyouths with serious medical and mental health needs, both at intake and throughout the youths' \n.t ime at LCJDC. All youth should undergo a health screenirig within one hour of admission to \n· LCJDC, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, in order to obtain accurate information \nabout the·.youth's medical and mental health.  Screenings should include information about, \nphysical health, suicide risk, alcohol and other drug use and abuse, aggressive behavior, family \nrelations, peer relations, social skills, educational status, and vocational statUs.  Corrections staff \nwho conduct screenings should be trroned by a health authority.  Youth requiring routine, urgent, · \nor-emergency care should receive timely referrals to qualified health professionals .. \nA qualified mental health professional should cbmplete an initial mental health \nassessment form that summarizes the youth's prior mental health history and includes a current \nmental status examination, suicide risk inquiry, provisional diagnosis, and treatment plan, if · \napplicable.  Youths should be referred for mental health services where such services are \nindicated as a result ofthe mental health screening and assessment process, or where a youth \ndemonstrates symptoms ofll).ental illness that significantly interfere with his or her ability to \ncomplete the facility's treatment program.  Mental health assessments should be adequately \ndocumented and, where indicated, should begin dming the youth's tiine in the intake unit and \ninclude:  pursuit and reView of prior behavioral health records; contact with the youth's family; \nconsultation with facility staff; interviews with the youth; and, where indicated, special~ed \ntesting and medical consultation.  Medical and mental health staffmg should be sufficient to \nprovide adequate medical and mental health care services to all youths requiring such services. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 25 of 30 PageiD #: 33 \n-25­\nLCJDC should establish and maintain adequate, formal, individualized treatment \nplanning that articulates specific planned behavioral interventions. At a minimum, interventions \nshould consist ofregularly scheduled individual counseling.  LCJDC should attempt to involve \nfamilies in the treatment planning process, and treatment plans should be periodically reviewed . \nand revised as appropriate.  Treatment plans for youths who are prescribed psychotropic \nmedications should specifY the medication, its target symptoms, and the basis for using it. \nQualified mental health professionals should provide and adequately document individual \ncounseling for youths who require counseling.  Documentation of counseling sessions should \ninclude clinical data regarding the youth's subjective expressions or mental status, problems \naddressed and the means of addressing them, the clinician's impressions of the youth's progress, \nand any plan for continuing treatment.  LCJDC.should also establish and maintain adequate \ntransition plarming.  At a minimum, mental health staff should provide a written summary ofthe \n. youth's mental health treatment, .his response to treatment, and a recommendation regarding \nfurther care. \nThe provision of adequate medication management should ensure that:  1) a prescribing \nprofessional performs and adeqtiately documents an assessment supporting the prescription; \n2) the prescribing professional adequately monitors youths on psychiatric medications by \nconducting and adequately documenting medication monitoring visits at least monthly, or more \nfrequently as indica~ed; and 3) appropriate cons.ent is obtained prior to starting a youth on a \nmedication. \nb. .  Suicide Prevention and Related Mental Health Care \nIn order to comply with generally accepted professional standards to provide adequate \nservices to potentially suicidal yoirths and take appropriate action to prevent youths from \nengaging in self-injurious behavior, including suicide, the County should establish a \ncomprehei:Jsive suicide prevention program. All staffmembers who interact with youths should \nreceive at least eight hours of-initial, competency-based suicide prevention training and two \nhours ofannual competency-based training thereafter.  The initial training should cover the \nfollowing topics:  1) avoiding obstacles to suicide prevention, juvenile suicide research; 2) why \nfacility envirorurients are conducive to suicidal behavior; 3) warning signs and symptoms of \nsuicide; and 4) components ofthe agency's suicide prevention program.  The annual training \nshould review any changes in the facility's suicide prevention policy and update staffon any \nserious suicides and/or attempts, not simply repeat initial training. \nLCJDC should ensure ongoing identification of suicide risk for youths.  Illunediately \nupon their arrival at the facility, newly admitted youths should receive adequate intake screening \nfor suicide risk before leaving the intake area.  Any staff member should be able to place a youth \non suicide precautions.  All potentially suicidal youths should be placed on suicide precautions \nunless a qualified mental health professional determines, following a face-to-face evaluation, that \nthe youth is not suicidal.  Youth who are admitted to segregation should receive a written \nas.sessment of suicide risk by mental health staff or by medical staff ifmental health staff \nmembers are unavailable.  LCJDC should ensure adequate communication among staff regarding \nyouths' potential suicidality.  Correctional, medical, and mental health staff shouldparticipate in \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 26 of 30 PageiD #: 34 \n-26­\ntreatment team meetings, and all staff should understand facility policies regarding \ncommunication. \nPotentially suicidal youths.'should be placed in rooms that are free of suicide hazards, \n\nincluding protrusions and tying off points, and should not be placed in isolation. ·Removal of \n\nyouths' clothing, other than belts and shoelaces, use ofrestraints, and suspension ofroutine \n\nprivileges such as visits, phone calls, and recreation, may only be employed by a qualified \n\nmental health professional as a last resort if a suicidal youth is engaging :iJi self-destructive \n\nbehavior.  LCJDC should.maintain sufficient staffing levels to supervise youths who require \n\nconstant observation.  · \n\nYouths who are removed from suicide precautions should receive regular follow-up \nassessments by mental health staff, including individualized treatment' plans for suicidal youths \nthat address relapse prevention and initiate a risk mansgement plan.  The risk mansgement plan \nshould describe:  the likely signs, symptoms, and circumstances for a recurrence ofsuicide risk, \nprevention ofsuicidal thoughts, and actions the youth or staff can take in response to the \nrecurrence of suicidal thoughts. \nAdequate mortality-morbidity reviews should be conducted, separate from any other \n\nnecessary formal investigations, after a completed suicide or a serious suicide  The \n\natt~mpt. \n. reviews should include:  1) review of the circumstances surrounding the incident; 2) revie:W of \nprocedures relevant to the incident; 3) review ofall relevant training provided to involved staff;  . \n4) review ofpertinent medical and mental health services/reports involving the youth victim;  5) \nreview of any possible precipitating factors that may have caused the youth to attempt or commit \nsuicide; and 6) recommendations, ifany, for changes in policy, training, physical plant, medical \nor mental health services, and operational procedures.  The mortality-morbidity review team \nshould be multidisciplinary and include mansgement and line staff from the direct care; medical, \nand !lJ,ental health areas.  The reviews should focus on the incident and what the facility can learn \nto prevent future incidents.  · · \nFurthermore, LCJDC should develop an adequate plan for intervening in suicide \nattempts, including ensuring that staff members notify emergency medical personnel \ninun~diately after the discovery of a life-threatening emergency; ensUring that all housing units \ncontain adequate emergency equipment, including rescue tools; and ensuring armual mock drills \nfor suicide attempts and armual competency-based instruction in the use of emergency equipmf)nt \nfor staff. The facility should also establish and maintain an adequate quality assurance program \nto measure compliance with the facility's. suicide prevention program, including the remedial  · \nmeasures outlined above. \n6.  Programming \nLCJDC should ensure the availability ofadequate rehabilitative programming, including, \nbut not limited to, education, counseling, and mental health services.  LCJDC should provide for \nevening and weekend programs and activities that allow youth to engage in meaningful \nactivities.  In addition, LCJDC should develop and implement a behavior mansgemei:J.t system \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 27 of 30 PageiD #: 35 \n-27­\nthat outlines prohibited behaviors (major and minor) and the sanctions or consequences for these \nbehaviors.  Written policies and procedures should allow youth at least one hour of large muscle \nexercise daily. \n7.  Staffing and Supervision \nLCJDG should ensure that staffmg and supervision levels are appropriate to adequately \nsupervise all youths.  The staffing pattern should consider the structural design of the L<;:!JDC, \nthe need to monitor residents on suicide watch, and other day-to-day operations.  For youths who \n.are locked in their cells, staff should make and document visual checks ofthe youths at random \nintervals at least every 15 minutes with youths sufficiently visible to permit staff to verify their \nwell-being.  Documentation ofmonitorillg should be accurate and contemporaneous. \nLCJDC should devel~p and implement appropriate training for staff.  Newly hired staff should \nreceive the requisite hours of competency-based training and all staff should receive appropriate \nadditional hours of annual training after the first year of employment.  All such trainings should \ninclude, but should not be limited to, training in use offorce, including safe crisis management \nand de-escalation techniques; training specific to the supervision of youths, including training on \nadolescent development; and trainiD.g in identifying and responding to fights, assaults, and sexual \naqtivity. \n8.  Enviromhental Safetv \nLCJDC should develop written housekeeping and emergency preparedness plans to \nensure that youth are provided reasonable conditions ofcare and safety.  The housekeeping plan \nshould adPI\"ess daily cleanliness and sanitation issues.  Linens, mattresses and clothing should be \nroutinely inspected and replaced as needed.  Written policies and procedures should also be \ndeveloped to address facility readiness for fires and other emergencies, including modifyitig the \n·current evacuation plan to ensure safe egress during emergencies. \n.  ..\n9.  Grievance System \n· Youths should have an effective and reliable process to l'llise grievances.  The process \nshould protect youth from possible retribution by staff.  A grievance coordinator should track, \ncategorize, and tabulate all grievances, which should be reviewed and addressed in a timely· \nmanner within five days ofreceipt.  Youth$ shl)uld be provided with notification of the final \nresolution.oftheir grievances, and bureaucratic responses to grievances should be prohibited.  . \nGrievance forms should be freely accessible in all areas frequented by youths, and youths should \nhave access to a grievance box from which grievances are retrieved dail¥· \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05112/15 28 of 30 PageiD #: 36 \n-28­\nB.  EDUCATION \n1.  General Education \nIn order to comply with federal constitutional and state statutory requirements for \nproviding adequate general education services to youths, the County should provide youth in \ndisciplinary confmement with the full range ofeducational services, provide all youth reasonable \naccess to reading and writing materials in their cells, and ensure youths at LCJDC receive the \nsame type and number ofdaily and weekly instructional minutes as other youths in the State's \nschools. \n2.  Child Find Procedures \nIn order to comply with federal statutory requirements for providing adequate special \neducation services to youths with disabilities, the County should provide adeqi.Jate screening of \nyouth for special education needs.  This includes obtaiillng prior education records from .school \nsystems in .a timely fashion .. Special education services should be provided to all youth with \ndisabilities who are in need of special education and related services after they are identified,  . \nlocated, and evaluated in accordance with Child Find.  Youths should be asked about previously \noffered special education during intake, and LCJDC should ensure documentation of academic \ninterventions for youths who are struggling.  · \n3.  General Instructional and Evaluative Interventions \nLCJDC should develop, implement, and maintain adequate pre-referral and general \neducation interventions.  LCJDC should also collect and maintain comprehensive educational \nrecords for all youth at the facility.  Prior to eva,luating a youth for special education, LCJDC \nshould determfue whether the youth is being provided appropriate instruction by.a highly \nqualified teacher and review data-based documentation ofthe youth's progress, including \nadequate documentation of the youth's behavior in his learning environment and regular \nclassroom setting. \n4.  Individualized Education Programs \nPursuant to IDEA, LCJDC should develop, implement, and maintain an adequate IEP for \neach youth who qualifies for an IEP and provide necessary related services.  IEPs shouid be \nupdated and/or completed as quickly as possible upon intake and reviewed at least annually. \nServices provided to youths with IEPs should be comparable to those described in the youth's \nIEP from his previous agency in the absence ofadequate justification for changes in services. \nParents and/or guardians shpuld be included in IEP meetings to the extent possible.  IEPs should \nbe adequately implemented and include collection and reporting of data on youth progress and \n·individual accommodations. \n\nCase: 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV Doc#: 1-1 Filed: 05/12/15 29 of 30 PageiD #: 37 \n• 29­\n5. \t Access to General Education Curriculum for Youth in Need of Special \nEducation Services \nIn order to ensure that youths with disabilities have sufficient access to special.education \nservices, LCIDC should provide that:  1) youths are enrolled in school within two days ofintake; \n2) youths are provided with access to the general education curriculum; 3) youths with, and at \nrisk for, disabilities are provided with adequate direct instruction using research-based \ninstructional approaches; 4) youths with disabilities receive not less than five hours of instruction \ndaily, the same number of daily and weekly instructional minutes as other youths in the State's \nschools; 5) youths with disabilities are provided appropriate instructional adaptations; and 6) \nadequate attendance records are maintained. \n6. \t Behavioral Supports \nYouths with disabilities should also receive adequate behavioral supports through a \nsystemic behavior plan thst does not permit the use of segregation and exclusionary settings. \nManifestation determination hearings should occur for youths with disabilities who are removed \nor segregated from their stated appropriate educational setting for disciplinary, administrative, or \nother reasons, in excess of ten days or in a pattern ofremovals.  Secondary interventions should \nbe implemented for youths who do not need individual behavior programs but need behavioral \nsupports beyond those offered in the facility plan. \n7. \t Staffing \nLCJDC should provide adequate special education staffing by developing, \nimplementing, and maintaining an education staffing plan and ensuring an adequate number of \nlicensed and highly qualified teachers, as well as qualified substitute teaehers, to provide· \ninstruction in all necessary courses. \n8. \t Transition Services \nResults-oriented, individualized, coordioated transition services should be provided for \nyouths with disabilities who are 16 years old or older to facilitate the youths' movement from \nschool to post-school activities. \n** * * * \nPlease note that this findiogs letter is a public document.

      "text": "u. \nS. Department of Jnstice \nCivil Rights Division \n------------~~~~----------------------------------~ \nAssistant Attorney General  Washington, D. C. 20530 \nJAN  12 2016 \nVIA EMAIL AND U.S. MAIL \nThe Honorable Phil Bryant \nGovernor \nState of Mississippi \n550 High Street \nJackson,MS  39201 \nThe Honorable Jim Hood \nAttorney General \nState of Mississippi \n550 High Street, Suite 1200 \nJackson,MS  39201 \nRe:  Investigation of Compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act at \nLeflore County, Mississippi, Juvenile Detention Center \nDear Governor Bryant and Attorney General Hood: \nWe write regarding the United States Department of Justice's (\"DOJ\") investigation of \nwhether the special education and related services at the Leflore County Juvenile Detention \nCenter (\"Detention Center\") in Greenwood, Mississippi, comply with the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. §§1400-1482, and  regulations promulgated for \nPart B of IDEA , in 34 C.F.R. § 300, et seq.  We find reasonable cause to believe that the \nprovision of special education and related services at the Detention Center school violates the \nfederal rights of children under IDEA in three important respects.  First, the Detention Center \nschool lacks appropriate Child Find policies to identify, locate and evaluate children with \ndisabilities.  Second, the Detention Center school does not promptly obtain students' \nIndividualized Education Programs (\"IEPs\") and related records from their horne schools.  Third, \nthe Detention Center school does not provide students with the educational services as described \nin IEPs, which deprives students with disabilities of a free appropriate public education \n(\"FAPE\"). \n\n2 \n \nOur investigation of the Detention Center began in 2009.  In addition to our first visit to \nthe Detention Center that year, we visited the Detention Center school in December 2013 and in \nJuly 2015.  During those visits, we met with the director, teachers and administrators who are \nresponsible for special education, and we spoke with many of the children who were there.      \nWe have also reviewed documents received from the Detention Center and from the Mississippi \nDepartment of Education.   \n \nThe Mississippi Department of Education operates the education program at the \nDetention Center, although Leflore County, Mississippi (“County”) owns and operates the \nfacility.  The Detention Center itself is small, with 30 beds, but its impact on Mississippi children \nis significant.  Male and female students between 10 and 17 years of age are typically detained \nthere for periods ranging from a few hours to more than 30 days, although the Detention Center \nhas the capability to house children for 90 days.  Children in the Detention Center are from \nLeflore County as well as 21 other Mississippi counties that contract with the County.  Although \nthere may be only a few children at the Detention Center at any one time, it houses large \nnumbers of children each year because children come and go throughout the year.  In addition, \nchildren are sometimes repeatedly confined in the Detention Center many times in a year or in \nquick succession.   \n \nThroughout our investigation of the Detention Center’s educational program, we received \nfull cooperation from representatives of the Mississippi Department of Education and the \nDetention Center staff.  We appreciate this cooperation, and we are aware that the staff and \neducators care deeply about the children and are making an effort to improve.  Although some \npositive changes have occurred, some of the significant violations of the IDEA that we identified \nin 2009 remain unresolved in 2015.  Our preferred course of action at this juncture would be to \navoid contested litigation through your cooperation to remedy the violations of IDEA that we \ndescribe in this letter.  We want to be clear, however, that if efforts at voluntary resolution are \nnot successful, the United States is authorized by law to initiate an action for appropriate relief.   \n \nIDEA INVESTIGATION \n \nWe first provided notice of our investigation to the County in August 2009 under the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“Section 14141”), \nand the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (“CRIPA”).  Both CRIPA \nand Section 14141 give DOJ authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that \nviolates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of youth in juvenile justice institutions, \nincluding violations of federal statutes such as IDEA.  We visited the Detention Center in \nNovember of 2009.  On March 31, 2011, we issued a Findings Letter to the County setting forth \nthe results of our investigation (“Findings Letter”), which is enclosed.   \nI.  IDEA Non-Compliance Findings Against the County During Our Initial Investigation. \nWhen we opened the investigation and conducted our initial onsite tour, education \nservices at the Detention Center school were being provided by the Leflore County school \ndistrict.  In our Findings Letter, we found that the Detention Center school failed to provide \n \n\n3 \n \nspecial education services to students with disabilities as required by IDEA.1  Specifically, the \nDetention Center deprived students of their right under IDEA to a free appropriate public \neducation (“FAPE”) by failing to identify children with disabilities, failing to provide them with \nthe specialized education and related services that IDEA requires, ignoring IDEA’s requirements \nfor student discipline, and leaving students struggling through material inappropriate for their \nlevel of achievement under the tutelage of an under-qualified teacher.  Findings Letter at 16-22. \n \nIn December 2013, we re-visited the Detention Center, accompanied by a special \neducation expert, to determine if the Detention Center had remedied the IDEA violations we \nfound in 2011.  We observed that the Detention Center had made little progress in addressing the \nIDEA violations we identified in our Findings Letter.  In December 2013, efforts to identify \nchildren with disabilities were still inadequate, the Detention Center did not promptly obtain \nIndividualized Education Program (“IEP”) records from students’ home schools, the Detention \nCenter did not provide education services described in IEPs, disruptive students were sent to \ntheir rooms all day without access to instructional materials, no staffing changes had occurred to \nensure that a qualified teacher taught core subjects above eighth grade to special education \nstudents, and the Detention Center did not provide transition services.  At the conclusion of our \ntour, a Special Litigation Section attorney and our education expert explained to the Detention \nCenter representatives the ongoing deficiencies with the Detention Center’s IDEA compliance. \nII.  Mississippi’s Take-Over of Responsibility for IDEA Compliance at the Detention Center \nSchool. \nOn September 16, 2013, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant announced the state’s take-\nover of the Leflore County schools.  The Governor’s proclamation stated that “due to a continued \npattern of poor student performance, which jeopardizes the safety, security, and educational \ninterests of the children enrolled in the schools of [Leflore County School District], a state of \nextreme emergency exists in the Leflore County School District.”  The proclamation placed the \nCounty school district under the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Board of Education pursuant to \nMississippi law and authorized the Board “to abolish the district and its existing school board \nand superintendent of schools.”2  A Mississippi Department of Education conservator remains in \ncharge of the County schools, which includes the school at the Detention Center.  As a result, \nMississippi is responsible for IDEA compliance at the Detention Center school.3 \n                                                 \n1  Our Findings Letter also identified numerous Constitutional violations relating to safety and security.  \nOn June 18, 2015, the federal district court for the Northern District of Mississippi entered a consent \ndecree that resolved our safety and security claims against the County.  Settlement Agreement and Order \nBetween the United States and Leflore County, Mississippi, United States v. Leflore Cnty., Mississippi, \nNo. 4:15-cv-00059-DMB-JMV, Dkt. # 10 (N.D. Miss. June 18, 2015).  The safety and security consent \ndecree did not resolve our IDEA claims, and the state was not a party to the decree.  \n2  The nine-member Mississippi Board of Education “formulate[s] policies according to law for \nimplementation by the State Department of Education.”  Miss. Const. art. VIII, § 203, cl. 2. \n3  The effect of the proclamation for IDEA purposes is that Mississippi and the Mississippi Board of \nEducation are now acting as the “local educational agency” for the Detention Center school and other \nCounty schools.  See 34 CFR §300.227 and 300.175 (Direct services by the SEA).  According to the \n \n\n4 \n \nAccordingly on December 19, 2014, pursuant to Section 14141, we expanded our \ninvestigation of the Detention Center to include examination of Mississippi’s role in providing \nspecial education and related services at this facility.  We explained in our notice of the \nexpanded investigation that if we concluded that Mississippi is violating IDEA at the Detention \nCenter, we would inform you of our conclusions.   \n \nIn response to our expanded investigation, Mississippi acknowledged internally the \ndeficiencies in the Detention Center school’s IDEA compliance.  An email describing a \nJanuary 16, 2015, meeting among Mississippi administrators and the Detention Center director \nstated, “IDEA compliance is an ongoing issue in a number of specific areas.”  On January 22, \n2015, Mississippi developed an “Improvement Plan for Students with Disabilities” outlining the \n“areas of noncompliance identified by the Department of Justice and the proposed corrective \nactions by the Leflore County School District and Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center.”  \nAn undated document entitled “Leflore County School District Efforts to Comply with \nCorrective Actions Required by the Department of Justice” purported to detail corrective actions \ntaken during 2014-2015.   \n \nOn March 10, 2015, we participated along with our education expert consultant in a \ntelephone conference with Mississippi education administrators.  We discussed our long-\nstanding concerns about the Detention Center’s IDEA compliance.  In response, the \nadministrators assured us that they had developed and implemented reforms to address our \nconcerns.  Mississippi agreed to and did provide documents we requested concerning its IDEA \ncompliance efforts.  \n \nWe again visited the Detention Center school on July 15, 2015, accompanied by our \neducation expert.  We spoke with the teachers, the teacher’s aide, the Detention Center director, \nrepresentatives of the Mississippi Department of Education, and several of the students present \nthat day, and we observed several periods of instruction.  We also reviewed documents received \nfrom Mississippi before and during our visit.  On September 28, 2015, our education expert \n                                                                                                                                                             \nproclamation, the County school district had administrative control and direction over the Detention \nCenter school.  The proclamation, however, vested control of the County schools in the Mississippi Board \nof Education and effectively made Mississippi the agency responsible for IDEA compliance at the \nDetention Center school (and other schools in the County). \n \nEven absent the take-over, however, Mississippi is generally responsible under IDEA for ensuring the \nprovision of special education and related services at the Detention Center school.  IDEA applies to \nMississippi under 34 C.F.R. §300.2(a), and to public agencies within Mississippi, including the “State \nEducational Agency,” defined as the “State board of education or other agency or officer primarily \nresponsible for the State supervision of public elementary schools and secondary schools.”  34 C.F.R. \n§300.2(b)(1)(i), 34 C.F.R. §300.41.  State educational agencies are responsible for ensuring: that IDEA \nrequirements are carried out; that each educational program for children with disabilities within the state \nis under the general supervision of persons at the state level; and that educational programs meet the \nstate’s educational standards, including IDEA requirements.  34 C.F.R. §300.149.   \n \n\n5 \n \njoined us in a conference call with an attorney representing the Mississippi Department of \nEducation and informed her of our observations during our tour.4  \n \nWe have completed our investigation, and we have reached the following conclusions: \n \n•  Mississippi violates the IDEA because the Detention Center school has failed to \nimplement appropriate Child Find policies and procedures to identify, locate and \nevaluate children with disabilities. \n \n•  Mississippi violates the IDEA because the Detention Center school does not obtain \nstudents’ IEPs from their home schools in a timely fashion.   \n \n•  Mississippi violates the IDEA by failing to provide students with disabilities a free \nappropriate public education because the Detention Center school does not provide \nstudents with the educational services as described in IEPs.5  \n \nVIOLATIONS OF IDEA \n \nCongress enacted the IDEA in 1975 to ensure that children with disabilities have \navailable to them a “free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and \nrelated services designed to meet their unique needs.”  20 U.S.C. §§ 1400(d)(1)(A) and \n1412(a)(1)(A).  With specific limited exceptions for those incarcerated in adult prisons, age-\neligible students with disabilities in detention are entitled to a free appropriate public education \nunder IDEA.  34 C.F.R. §§ 300.101-102, § 300.324 (d)(1)(i). \n \nChildren with disabilities who are in detention do not forfeit their right to special \neducation services.  See Statement of Interest of the United States, G.F. v. Contra Costa Cnty., \nNo. 3:13-cv-03667-MEJ (N.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2014) at 12 (“The fact that youth have been charged \nwith or convicted of a crime does not diminish their substantive rights, procedural safeguards, \nand remedies provided under the IDEA to youth with disabilities and their parents.”); see also \nDear Colleague Letter on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for Students with \nDisabilities in Correctional Facilities, Office of Special Educ. and Rehabilitative Serv., U.S. \nDep’t of Educ. 1 (Dec. 5, 2014) (“Dear Colleague Letter”).  “Every agency at any level of \ngovernment that is involved in the provision of special education and related services to students \nin correctional facilities must ensure the provision of [a free appropriate public education].”  \nDear Colleague Letter at 2.   \n                                                 \n4  Due to time constraints and scheduling conflicts, we were unable to provide an “exit interview” at the \nconclusion of our July 2015 visit, or to give a summary of our ongoing concerns prior to our phone call \non September 28, 2015. \n5  In the context of an investigation in Mississippi’s system for serving children with mental health \nconditions in the state, we made similar findings regarding Mississippi’s IDEA compliance in state-run \npsychiatric facilities.  See Letter from Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez re: United States’ \nInvestigation of the State of Mississippi’s Service System for Serving Persons with Mental Illness and \nDevelopmental Disabilities (Dec. 22, 2011) at 31-32 (finding that Mississippi failed to meet its Child Find \nobligation and its obligation to serve children in the least restrictive setting appropriate). \n \n\n6 \n \nIDEA explicitly applies to juvenile correctional facilities that “are involved in the \neducation of children with disabilities.”  See 34 C.F.R. § 300.2(b)(1)(iv).  See also Handberry v. \nThompson, 219 F. Supp. 2d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (requiring that a correctional facility provide \nchildren with IDEA-compliant educational services), aff’d in relevant part, 446 F.3d 335 (2d Cir. \n2006); Alexander S. v. Boyd, 876 F. Supp. 773, 788 (D.S.C. 1995) (finding IDEA applicable to \nschool-aged detainees in juvenile detention facilities); Donnell C. v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ., \n829 F. Supp. 1016, 1020 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (holding that IDEA applies to children held in pretrial \ndetention).  Short-stay facilities are no exception; children in detention facilities for short periods \nare nevertheless entitled to an IDEA-compliant education.  See, e.g., Alexander S., 876 F. Supp. \nat 801-03 (after finding practical ways to remove obstacles due to stays averaging 21 days, the \ncourt expected the correctional facility to come “into strict compliance with the IDEA and \nSection 504”); Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Connecticut Dep’t of Educ., 780 A.2d 154, 168 (Conn. \nApp. Ct. 2001) (state court case interpreting IDEA and finding that “[a]lthough the volume of \nshort-term residents may be daunting, this factor does not relieve the plaintiff from the burden of \nupholding the right of a special education student to a free and appropriate public education.”), \ncert. denied, 782 A.2d 1253 (Conn. 2001).6  \nI.  The Detention Center School Fails to Implement Appropriate and Effective Child \nFind Policies and Practices. \nIDEA requires that SEAs have in effect policies and procedures to “ensure that [a]ll \nchildren with disabilities residing in the State . . . and who are in need of special education and \nrelated services, are identified, located, and evaluated.”  34 C.F.R. § 300.111(a)(1)(i); see also 20 \nU.S.C. § 1412(a)(3) and 1413(a)(1).  This is known as “Child Find.”  The Child Find \nrequirement imposes an affirmative duty to have in effect policies and procedures to locate and \ntimely evaluate children “who are suspected of being a child with a disability . . . and who are in \nneed of special education and related services,” including those children who “are advancing \nfrom grade to grade[.]”  34 C.F.R. §§ 300.111(a), (c)(1).   \n \nThe state is responsible for having Child Find policies and procedures in effect; public \nagencies involved in the education of children with disabilities, including local educational \nagencies and juvenile correctional facilities, must implement these policies.  See Dear Colleague \nLetter at 3-4, 8, 11.  The Child Find duty is triggered “when the local educational agency has \nreason to suspect a disability coupled with reason to suspect that special education services may \nbe needed to address that disability.”  El Paso Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Richard R., 567 F. Supp. 2d \n918, 949-51 (W.D. Tex. 2008) (school district failed to fulfill Child Find obligations by not \nreferring the child for an evaluation “despite clear signals that an evaluation was necessary and \nappropriate”).   \n \nIn the context of a juvenile correctional facility, Child Find responsibilities include \nstudents who have never been identified as a student with a disability prior to their entry into the \nfacility.  Dear Colleague Letter at 3.  The facility may not “assume that a student that enters a \ncorrectional facility is not a student with a disability simply because he or she has not yet been \n                                                 \n6  Civil actions regarding IDEA may be brought in state courts of competent jurisdiction as well as in \nfederal district courts.  See 20 U.S.C. §1415(i)(2)(A). \n \n\n7 \n \nidentified as such.”  Id. at 11.  Students in a correctional setting who are suspected of having a \ndisability must be evaluated in a timely manner, “even if the student will not be in the facility \nlong enough to complete the evaluation.”  Id. at 4.  Mississippi, which has taken the place of the \nLeflore County school district, and the correctional facility “must coordinate assessments to \nensure that a timely evaluation occurs.”  Id; see also 34 C.F.R. §300.304(c)(5). \n \nOur investigation of Mississippi’s compliance with the IDEA at the Detention Center \ndetermined that the state does not identify, locate and timely evaluate children to determine \nwhether they are in need of special education and related services. The Detention Center school \ndoes not adequately screen children for disability, timely obtain academic records, adequately \nobserve and respond to student performance, or refer children for an evaluation to determine \nwhether they may have a disability when there is reason to believe that the student is struggling \nin school, is failing or is at risk of poor educational performance.  These findings are consistent \nwith violations identified in our 2011 findings letter, and reveal that Mississippi’s efforts to bring \nthe Detention Center into compliance with IDEA Child Find obligations have been unsuccessful. \n \nIn response to our expanded investigation, Mississippi explained its Child Find policies \nand procedures to us in March 2015.  For children who are County residents, Mississippi stated \nthat “those detainees who are suspected of having a disability are referred to the school district’s \nMET [Multidisciplinary Evaluation Team] for action.”  For children who reside outside the \nCounty, Mississippi told us that the child’s home school is contacted to obtain the IEP.  Some \nschools have IEPs in electronic form, but others do not. \n \nIn our July 2015 visit, however, we observed that the Detention Center was still not \ntaking basic steps to identify students who are in need of special education and related services. \n \nFirst, Mississippi is in violation of IDEA Child Find obligations because the Detention \nCenter fails to adequately screen children for disability or the need for special education and \nrelated services.  The Detention Center uses an intake form when children first arrive at the \nDetention Center school, but the form does not gather information about the child’s special \neducation status or needs, or inquire whether the student had received special education services \nin the past.  Instead, the form asks generic questions such as “Did you attend school on a regular \nbasis?”, “Do you like reading books?”, and “How do you learn best?”  \n \nMississippi also does not take adequate steps to determine whether there is a link between \na child’s educational deficits and disability. The Detention Center uses a screening test known as \nTests of Adult Basic Education (“TABE”) as an indicator of academic performance for new \nstudents.  TABE can measure a child’s level of achievement, but it does not provide information \nthat explains why the child is achieving at that level.  For instance, TABE might assess a student \nas performing at the ninth grade level, but TABE would provide no information about whether \nthat performance might be due to a disability.  For that reason, TABE alone is an insufficient \nChild Find tool to identify students who may need special education.  Cf. D.K. v. Abington Sch. \nDist., 696 F.3d 233, 250 (3d Cir. 2012) (“a poorly designed and ineffective round of testing does \nnot satisfy a school’s Child Find obligations”).7  The Detention Center School staff admitted that \n                                                 \n7 We pointed out similar problems in our 2011 Findings Letter.  We observed that the Detention Center \nhad a structured intake assessment form, but Child Find was significantly limited by inadequate or non-\n \n\n8 \n \nif a student performs poorly on the TABE, the staff members take no further steps to determine \nwhether the child has a disability that may require special education and related services.   \n \nDuring our July 2015 visit, we encountered a child who had not been screened for an \neducational disability and seemed to have fallen through the cracks entirely.  We initially \nencountered 15-year-old A.A.8 sleeping in his cell on July 14 during the school day.9  He had \narrived at the Detention Center on June 29, but he could not recall the last time he went to the \nDetention Center school, although he said he may have been once or twice.  He said that when he \narrived, no one asked him if he was a special education student, and he did not take an \neducational assessment.  He said he does not have to go to school, it is his choice whether to go \nto school, and a lot of students stay out of school.  Failing to take steps to determine whether a \nstudent is in need of special education and related services for weeks does not satisfy the \nrequirements of Child Find \n \nSecond, Mississippi’s student records retrieval practices contribute to the ongoing \nviolations of Child Find requirements at the Detention Center.  As described more fully below in \nSection II, we saw no evidence establishing that the Detention Center school obtains the \nacademic records of each student promptly.  In addition, the Special Education Director for the \nDetention Center told us that the Detention Center does not retrieve a student’s educational \nrecords from the student’s home school district unless the Detention Center learns the child \nalready has an IEP.  As a result, the Detention Center cannot examine a student’s educational \nrecords upon or shortly after arrival and identify students suspected of having a disability that \nwould entitle them to an evaluation and if found eligible for special education and related \nservices, an IEP.  Because Mississippi attempts to obtain records only of children who have \nalready been identified as eligible for special education and related services, the Detention \nCenter lacks key information that could be relevant in determining whether the child should be \nevaluated for eligibility. \n \nThird, the Detention Center violates IDEA’s Child Find obligations because it fails to \nobserve and respond to student performance that may indicate that the student has a disability \nand needs special education and related services.  In conducting Child Find in this context, \neducators generally observe student performance and comprehension of material and consider \nwhether failure to perform adequately may be the result of a disability.  See generally El Paso \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 567 F. Supp. 2d at 951 (based on the child’s record of consecutive failure on \nstandardized tests, his “continuing difficulties in multiple subjects, and the inability of prior \n                                                                                                                                                             \nexistent assessments and faulty scoring.  The intake forms did not capture data regarding special \neducation status or history, and we identified two children who had previously received special education \nservices but the Detention Center had not identified them as possibly having a disability.  Findings Letter \nat 18.   \n8  To protect the confidentiality of the children in the Detention Center, we will use pseudonym initials.  \n9  We visited the Detention Center on July 14 and 15, 2015.  Our July 14 visit centered upon the safety \nand security issues embodied in the existing consent decree; our July 15 visit centered on our IDEA \ninvestigation.  See supra note 1. \n \n\n9 \n \naccommodations to improve his scores,” there was reason to suspect that the child “had a \ndisability and that special education services might be needed to address that disability.”). 10   \n \nAt the Detention Center, children receive education through the use of instructional \ncomputer software called “Grade Results.”  Mississippi describes Grade Results as “a central \ncomponent of the academic program at the Detention Center.”  Each child sits at a computer \nworking through the computer program, which has a tutorial followed by an assessment.11  \nDuring our July 15 visit, we observed a male student doing a lesson in Grade Results.  He did not \ntake the tutorial but instead took the assessment repeatedly for hours, generating failing score \nafter failing score.  While this student struggled through the assessment, there were seven other \nchildren in the classroom working on their own Grade Results lessons and two teachers.   \n \nIn this situation, the teacher should notice if a student encounters difficulty and should \nrespond with a general education intervention (such as working with the student to develop an \nunderstanding of the material).  See generally 34 C.F.R. § 300.309 (qualified professionals may \ndetermine that a child has a specific learning disability if “[t]he child does not make sufficient \nprogress to meet age or State-approved grade-level standards in one or more of the areas \nidentified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when using a process based on the child's response \nto scientific, research-based intervention”).  If the student continues to fail, however, the teacher \nshould begin to suspect a disability and should consider referring the student for an evaluation.12  \nHowever, for the male student we observed, neither teacher responded to this pattern of failure \nor, to our knowledge, referred the student for an evaluation. \n \nFinally, Mississippi fails to refer children at the Detention Center for special education \nevaluations.  Mississippi told us that “there have not been any students referred for special \neducation while placed in the Leflore County Juvenile Detention Center” since October 2014.  \nBoth teachers at the Detention Center said they have not referred a child for special education \nevaluation for as long as they can remember.  It is estimated that between 28 percent and 43 \npercent of detained and incarcerated youthful offenders have an identified special education \ndisability, with a majority of these being learning disabilities.13  That the Detention Center has \n                                                 \n10 See also 34 C.F.R. § 300.310 (a) (for children suspected of having learning disabilities, “[t]he public \nagency must ensure that the child is observed in the child's learning environment (including the regular \nclassroom setting) to document the child's academic performance and behavior in the areas of \ndifficulty.”).   \n11 Our concerns about the use of computer-based instruction at the Detention Center are set out in more \ndetail later in this letter, in the discussion of Mississippi’s failure to provide a free appropriate public \neducation to students with disabilities at the Detention Center. \n12  Cf. Analysis of Comments and Changes, Assistance to States for the Education of Children With \nDisabilities and Preschool Grants for Children With Disabilities, 71 Fed. Reg. 46540, 46727 (Aug. 14, \n2006) (to be codified at 34 C.F.R. Parts 300, 301) (noting in the context of IDEA due process protections \nfor students who have not yet been determined to have a disability that “[s]chool personnel should refer \nchildren for evaluation through the agency’s child or special education referral system when the child’s \nbehavior or performance indicates they may have a disability covered under the Act.”).   \n13  Christopher A. Mallett, Seven Things Juvenile Courts Should Know About Learning Disabilities, \nNational Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, 5 (2011).  See generally Elizabeth Cate, Teach \n \n\n10 \n \nnot identified any children in need of special education since October 2014 indicates that the \nDetention Center’s Child Find procedures are ineffective and that children at the Detention \nCenter who are in need of special education and related services are not being identified, located \nand evaluated. \nII.  The Detention Center School Does Not Obtain IEPs Promptly.   \nIDEA entitles students with disabilities to “a free appropriate public education which \nemphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs . . . .”  \nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 309 (1988); see also 20 U.S.C. §1412(a)(1).  These services are \nmemorialized in an IEP, which is “the central mechanism by which public schools ensure that \ntheir disabled students receive a free appropriate education.”  Polera v. Bd. of Educ. of the \nNewburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 482 (2d Cir. 2002).   \n \nIDEA requires that each student with a disability have an IEP to ensure that the student \nreceives FAPE.  A child with an IEP retains the right to FAPE in accordance with an IEP when \nthat child moves from one school district to another school district in the same State and enrolls \nin a new school in the same school year, including when the new school is in a juvenile detention \nfacility.  34 C.F.R. § 300.323(e) (when a student with an IEP transfers from one public agency to \nanother in the state, the new public agency “must provide FAPE to the child (including initially \nthrough services comparable to those described in the child’s IEP from the previous public \nagency”); see also Dear Colleague Letter at 4, 10.  The correctional facility “either must adopt and \nimplement the child’s existing IEP or hold an IEP Team meeting to modify the contents of the \nIEP.”  Dear Colleague Letter at 13 (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.323(e)). \n   \nIDEA also requires that the Detention Center take reasonable steps to obtain a child’s \nrecords “promptly,” including IEPs and supporting documents and any other records relating to \nthe provision of special education and related services to the child from the previous public \nagency in which the child was enrolled.  34 C.F.R. § 300.323(g)(1).  The Detention Center “must \nhave policies and procedures to ensure that the relevant records of students with disabilities who \nmove to, and from, correctional facilities are transferred as expeditiously as possible.”  Dear \nColleague Letter at 4, 10; see also id. at 12 (“public agencies [are required to] take reasonable \nsteps to promptly exchange relevant records”).  If the IEP cannot be obtained from the parent or \nfrom the previous public agency, “the new public agency must, at a minimum, place the student \nin the regular school program, conduct an evaluation, and make an eligibility determination.”  \nDear Colleague Letter at 11 (citing 34 C.F.R. §300.323(f)(1)).   \n \nWe determined that Mississippi does not promptly obtain IEPs for children with \ndisabilities at the Detention Center.  Our findings are based in part on the state’s own analysis.  A \nMarch 31, 2015 audit report of the Mississippi Office of Compulsory School Attendance \nEnforcement concluded that the Leflore County school district (which was then and remains \nunder the control of Mississippi) “has not met the criteria for appropriately providing educational \n                                                                                                                                                             \nYour Children Well: Proposed Challenges to Inadequacies of Correctional Special Education for \nJuvenile Inmates, 34 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 1, 10 (2010) (noting that approximately nine percent \nof all students aged six to twenty-one receive special education services nationally, but juvenile offenders \nqualify for these services at almost four times that rate).  \n \n\n11 \n \nservices.”  The audit recommended that the district “will need to implement protocol for \nimmediate transmission of educational records for students with disabilities’ Individual \nEducation Plan (IEP).”  Similarly, a state “Observation Checklist for Detention Center Visits” \nnoted on February 2, 2015 that two children at the Detention Center had IEPs, but that the \nDetention Center did not retrieve the correct IEP for either child from their home school district.  \n \nMississippi told us that it has now “implemented a process to secure the IEPs from home \nschool districts on each youth detainee within 24 hours of their arrival at the Detention Center.”  \nEach day, an employee of the Mississippi Department of Education is to obtain the daily roster \nof children at the Detention Center.  The employee is to use a computerized system called \nMississippi Student Information System (“MSIS”) to locate each student’s records and determine \nthe student’s home school and whether the child has an IEP.  If so, the employee is to contact the \nhome school to obtain the IEP, and the home school is to send the IEP to the Detention Center \nschool. \n \nWith advance notice to Mississippi, we intended to confirm the state’s claims about its \nMSIS system during our July 2015 visit.  Unfortunately, we found that Mississippi’s system does \nnot result in the prompt retrieval of children’s IEPs.  The MSIS system was unavailable during \nour July 2015 visit.  The system was down for maintenance, and we were told that the MSIS \nsystem is taken down for maintenance for the entire month of July every year, even though the \nDetention Center school operates year-round.  Consequently, we were not able to inspect and \nevaluate the effectiveness of the MSIS system in determining whether a student has an IEP.  \nEven if the MSIS system had been functioning, however, it would not have facilitated the receipt \nof IEPs at the Detention Center.  Neither of the teachers nor any other Detention Center staff has \nMSIS computer access or has been trained to use MSIS.  In addition, Mississippi public schools \nwere in summer recess during our July visit, so the Detention Center could not be sure that \nsomeone would be available at a student’s home school to respond to a request for an IEP.14  The \nSpecial Education Director for the Detention Center told us that the social worker responsible for \nrequesting IEPs left on June 17.   \n \nThe Detention Center staff should be prepared to obtain IEPs promptly year-round, using \nalternative means if the MSIS system is unavailable or public schools are in recess, but it was \napparent that Mississippi’s current system does not work. 15   When we visited the Detention \nCenter school on July 15, we learned that the Detention Center had not yet obtained the current \nIEP of B.B., a special education student who had arrived over two weeks earlier on June 30.  The \nDetention Center obtained B.B.’s IEP the day of our visit, but only after our education expert \nstrongly expressed concern about the fact that B.B. was not being provided educational services \nin accord with an IEP.  Similarly, C.C. arrived at the Detention Center on June 24, but the \nfacsimile stamp on her IEP was July 15 -- the date of our visit.  This is the same sort of IDEA \n                                                 \n \n15  The Detention Center was able to produce for us some IEPs for students who had already left the \nDetention Center.  These IEPs do not bear fax stamps or other information establishing when the \nDetention Center received the IEP, so we could not evaluate whether the Detention Center received those \nIEPs promptly following each student’s arrival. \n \n\n12 \n \nviolation documented in our 2011 findings letter, which demonstrates that Mississippi’s efforts \nto develop a protocol to obtain IEPs promptly have been unsuccessful.16 \n \nIII.  The Detention Center School Does Not Provide Children with Disabilities with a Free \nAppropriate Public Education.  \n \nFAPE includes the provision of special education and related services in conformity \nwith” an IEP.  34 C.F.R. § 300.17(d).  IDEA requires that each public agency must have “in \neffect,” for each child with a disability in its jurisdiction, an IEP, as defined in §300.320.  34 \nC.F.R. § 300.323(a).  Failure to implement the IEP is a denial of FAPE.  See Houston Indep. Sch. \nDist. v. Bobby R., 200 F.3d 341, 349 (5th Cir. 2000) (IDEA is violated by failures to implement \nsubstantial or significant IEP provisions), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 817 (2000); see generally Van \nDuyn ex rel. Van Duyn v. Baker Sch. Dist. 5J, 502 F.3d 811, 822 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that a \nmaterial failure to implement an IEP violates the IDEA); Neosho R–V Sch. Dist. v. Clark, 315 \nF.3d 1022, 1027 n. 3 (8th Cir. 2003) (“[W]e cannot conclude that an IEP is reasonably calculated \nto provide a free appropriate public education if there is evidence that the school actually failed \nto implement an essential element of the IEP that was necessary for the child to receive an \neducational benefit.”); Williamson Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. C.K., No. 3:07-0826, 2009 WL 499386, \nat *19 (M.D. Tenn. Feb. 27, 2009) (the school must provide educational benefits that are more \nthan de minimis in order to be “appropriate”).  In addition, the child’s IEP must be accessible to \nthe child’s regular education and special education teachers and “any other service provider who \nis responsible for its implementation.”  34 C.F.R. § 300.323(d)(1). \n \nWe determined that Mississippi fails to provide FAPE to children with disabilities at the \nDetention Center.  A primary cause of the denial of FAPE is the state’s failure to timely obtain \nIEPs, as described above.  Because the school personnel at the Detention Center are unaware of \nthe existence of the IEP or its content, it is self-evident that they cannot implement it.  As we \nexplain in more detail below, we also found that the Detention Center’s overreliance on \ncomputerized education contributes to the failure to provide FAPE. \n \nOn March 23, 2015, Mississippi assured us that the Detention Center was both obtaining \nand implementing students’ IEPs.  The Detention Center Special Education Director wrote that \nthe state had implemented a process not only to obtain IEPs promptly, but to review and revise \nIEPs as necessary, and to “carry[] the IEP out as adopted” (emphasis added).   Just a few days \nlater, however, on March 31, 2015, an audit by the Mississippi Office of Compulsory School \nAttendance Enforcement revealed that the Leflore County School District “needs to ensure that \nservices are provided to students with special needs in accordance with the students’ IEP.” \n \n \n                                                 \n16 When we issued our Findings Letter in 2011, the Detention Center did not have an effective system for \nretrieval of students’ IEPs from their home schools.  We noted then that no IEPs were available at the \nDetention Center school during our 2009 tour.  We discovered a student with special needs who had been \nhoused at the Detention Center for 36 days with no IEP.  This violated IDEA.  Findings Letter at 19. \n \n \n\n13 \n \nOur July 2015 visit to the Detention Center school revealed significant deficiencies in \nIEP implementation and the provision of FAPE.  Because the Detention Center does not obtain \nIEPs in a timely fashion, there were no instructional adaptations listed on lesson plans17, IEPs \nwere not used to drive instruction, and children did not receive the special education, related \nservices, and supplementary aids and services and other supports contained in IEPs.   We \ndocumented similar inadequacies in our 2011 findings letter; our 2015 visit revealed that any \nmeasures taken by Mississippi to remedy these problems have been ineffective.18 \n \nThe Detention Center’s failure to implement IEPs has significant consequences for \nchildren with disabilities.  The facsimile stamp on C.C.’s IEP indicates she was at the Detention \nCenter for 14 school days without her IEP.  Her IEP directed that C.C. should receive her \neducation services in small groups, have test direction read to her, be seated at the front of the \nroom, be allowed a calculator, and receive the “related service” of speech therapy on a weekly \nbasis.19  In anticipation of our July 15 visit, we requested documents concerning related services \npursuant to IEPs since April 21, 2015.  No documents were provided indicating that a speech \ntherapist provided services to C.C., even though Mississippi produced records demonstrating that \nthe Detention Center has two licensed speech therapists and one licensed occupational therapist \navailable to provide related services to children there.  \n \nSimilarly, B.B. was at the Detention Center for 10 school days without his current IEP.  \nThe IEP, obtained by the Detention Center during our visit, directed that B.B. receive medication \nfor Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at school by the nurse, be clued to stay on task, be \nallowed extra time to complete graded activities, and receive speech therapy twice weekly.  The \nIEP also noted that “[d]ue to language deficits, the student needs a quiet location in a small group \nto learn specific language skills to improve communication.”  We observed on July 15 that B.B. \nwas receiving computerized instruction in the same classroom as the other students rather than a \nquiet location in a small group, even though the Detention Center has a separate classroom where \nstudents could receive instruction alone or in small groups.  In addition, as with C.C., there was \nno indication in the documents Mississippi produced that B.B. received speech therapy.   \n                                                 \n17 Instructional adaptations “support students’ interactions through changes in the presentation, setting, \ntiming or scheduling, and response mode of instruction.”  Leanne R. Ketterlin-Geller & Elisa M. \nJamgochian, Instructional Adaptations:  Accommodations and Modifications that Support Accessible \nInstruction 131 (Stephen N. Elliott et. al. eds.) (2011); See also 34 C.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3) (under IDEA, \nspecial education includes “specially designed instruction,” defined as adapting, as appropriate to the \nchild’s needs, “the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction” to address the child’s unique \ndisability-related needs and to ensure the child’s access to the general curriculum, so that the child can \nmeet the educational standards within the jurisdiction of the public agency  that apply to all children.) \n18 In our 2011 Findings Letter, we noted the Detention Center did not comply with IDEA requirements \ngoverning IEPs.  IEPs were not available, and thus, they were not implemented.  No instructional \nadaptations were observed at the Detention Center, nor were any adaptations listed on lesson plans.  \nLesson plans were incomplete, there was no evidence of academic or behavioral-related record keeping, \nand lesson plans did not differentiate assignments for students at various levels.  Findings Letter at 19.   \n19  See 34 C.F.R. § 300.34 (related services include “such developmental, corrective and other supportive \nservices as are required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education, and includes \nspeech-language pathology and audiology services.”) \n \n\n14 \n \nWe also find that the Detention Center’s almost exclusive use of computerized education \ncontributes to the denial of FAPE.  Our observations and document reviews revealed that the \nDetention Center school uses a “one-size-fits all” approach to children’s special education needs, \nassigning them computerized instruction with little or no consideration of how the child’s \ndisability affects his progress in the general education curriculum, or what special education, \nrelated services and supplementary aids and services might allow the child to receive FAPE.  \nDetention Center special education students often had supplementary aids or other services \nprovided on their IEPs that the computerized instruction did not provide.  For instance, IEPs that \nMississippi provided to us20 contained an array of educational aids and alterations to the \ncurriculum: \n \n•  D.D. should receive supplementary aids and services and personnel supports in \ngeneral education, including “[r]edirect student to the test,” “[r]ead test directions \n(but not test items) to student or group-repeating and/or paraphrasing directions,” and \n“[e]xtended time.”   \n \n•  E.E. needed to be “[clue]d to stay on task.”   \n \n•  F.F.’s teachers should “shorten assignments and test.”   \n \n•  G.G. should have all tests and assignments “[r]ead aloud except for when dealing \nwith reading comprehension.”   \n \n•  H.H. needed a daily “[c]heck for understanding.”   \n \n•  I.I. needed test directions read to him, needed the teacher to “highlight key \nwords/phrases in directions (e.g. complete sentences, show your work),” needed to be \nallowed “marking of answers in booklet and transferring of answers from test \nbooklet,” and needed to have a spelling dictionary that showed the correct spelling \nbut did not give definitions.   \n \n•  J.J. needed to be “[s]eated by himself, away from distractions” but should “take tests \nin inclusion room.” \n \nTo comply with IDEA, the Detention Center must provide each eligible student with a \ndisability with FAPE in conformity with his or her IEP.  As noted above, when a child moves to \na detention center, the facility must either provide the special education and related services and \nsupplementary aids and services and other supports included in the child’s IEP, or convene an \nIEP team to develop and implement a new IEP that meets IDEA requirements. 34 CFR \n§300.323(e)(1)-(2). The Detention Center does not carry out either of these means of providing \n                                                 \n20  In response to our document requests in March 2015 and July 2015, Mississippi provided us with \nseveral IEPs for students who had been at the Detention Center in the first half of 2015.  In most cases, \nwe could not match an IEP with the Detention Center daily roster of children at the facility.  When we did \nfind an IEP for a child who appeared on the roster, the IEP often bore no indication as to when it was \nreceived.   \n \n\n15 \n \nFAPE.  Instead, lacking IEPs, it uses computerized tutorials as its predominant mode of \ninstruction.  As the above sample of specific, individualized educational aids and instructional \nalterations shows, however, reliance on a computer software program is no substitute for a \nteacher who can respond to the child’s needs and exercise professional judgment in \nimplementing the child’s IEP.  Furthermore, the Detention Center school should have been able \nto readily implement the common-sense, practical interventions reflected in these IEPs, given the \nschool’s small size, physical lay-out, and available staff.  \n \nREMEDIAL MEASURES \n \nTo rectify the identified deficiencies and protect the federal statutory rights of children \nconfined at the Detention Center, Mississippi should implement the minimal remedial measures \nset forth below.   \n \nA.  Mississippi Should Use Reliable Screening Methods and Ensure the Timely \nEvaluation of Children Suspected of Having a Disability.  \n \nTo comply with IDEA requirements to identify, locate and evaluate children suspected of \nhaving a disability who are in need of special education and related services, Mississippi should \nprovide adequate screening of students for special education needs when they enter the Detention \nCenter.  Students should be asked about previously offered special education during intake.  \nWhen feasible, staff at the Detention Center should reach out to staff at sending school districts \nto discuss whether disability may be the reason for any educational deficits observed in \nDetention Center students.  For children who have previously been detained at the Detention \nCenter, staff should use their own knowledge and, if possible, any Detention Center educational \nrecords, in assessing whether these children have a disability.   \n \nOnce the child is in the Detention Center, Mississippi should require teachers to observe \nand evaluate student performance and to implement and ensure documentation of academic \ninterventions for students who are struggling academically. If the documented interventions are \nunsuccessful, the teacher should consider referring the child for a special education evaluation.  \nMississippi should include in its Child Find practices working with individuals in the community \nwho come into contact with children entering the Detention Center, including social workers, \nprobation officers, law enforcement and medical and mental health professionals and other staff.  \nSee Dear Colleague Letter at 9.  As these professionals are an initial point of contact for juvenile \njustice involved children, their ability to identify children suspected of having disabilities may \nallow these children to be evaluated and served appropriately while in the Detention Center.  \nMississippi should also provide and ensure documentation of academic interventions for students \nwho are struggling while in the Detention Center School and take steps to determine whether \nstudents’ educational difficulties may indicate a disability. \n \nWhere the Detention Center suspects that a child may have a disability, the child must be \nevaluated in a timely manner, even if the child will not be in the Detention Center long enough to \ncomplete the evaluation. See Dear Colleague Letter at 3-4, 11.  Communication and coordination \nwith the child’s home school district is essential in this process. \n \n\n16 \n \nB.  Mississippi Should Obtain Education Records For All Students Entering the \nDetention Center. \n \nTo identify, locate and evaluate children suspected of having a qualifying disability, the \nDetention Center should obtain prior education records from school systems for all arriving \nstudents to identify students who have IEPs and to determine whether the school performance of \na child who is not receiving special education indicates that the child may have a disability.   \n \nC.  Mississippi Should Promptly Obtain IEPs from a Child’s Home School. \n \nTo identify, locate and evaluate children suspected of having a disability who need \nspecial education and related services and to ensure the provision of a free appropriate public \neducation for eligible students with disabilities at the Detention Center Mississippi should \ndevelop an appropriate and reliable system for the Detention Center to promptly obtain IEPs \nfrom a student’s home school, including when the computerized MSIS system is unavailable or \npublic schools are in recess.   \n \nD.  Mississippi Should Provide Individualized Special Education and Related Services to \nStudents with Disabilities. \n \nA free appropriate public education must be provided to all students with disabilities who \nhave been determined to need special education and related services after they are identified, \nlocated, and evaluated in accordance with Child Find.  The special education and related services \nprovided should be individualized to the child’s specific disability and educational needs and \nshould not be a “one-size-fits all” approach.  To the extent that a child’s IEP requires special \neducation, related services or supplementary aids and services that cannot be provided through \nthe Detention Center’s computerized instruction, Mississippi must ensure that the education and \nservices are provided, including through classroom instruction, if necessary.   Further, as \nrecommended in the Dear Colleague Letter, in implementing or devising IEPs for children at the \nDetention Center, Mississippi “should pay particular attention to those related services that are \nlikely to be required for students in correctional facilities – for example, counseling, parent \ncounseling and training, psychological services, transportation, and social work services in \nschools.” See Dear Colleague Letter at 14 (citing 34 C.F.R. §300.34(c)(2), (c)(8), (c)10, (c)(14), \nand (c)16)).   \n \nE.  Mississippi Should Develop, Implement, and Review IEPs for Students with \nDisabilities. \n \nPursuant to IDEA, Mississippi must either implement an appropriate IEP for each student \nat the Detention Center school who is eligible for services under IDEA, and who had an IEP \nfrom a previous school district, and provide necessary special education and related services, or \ndevelop and implement new IEPs for these students.  When the Detention Center develops IEPs \nfor students, the Detention Center must use a properly constituted IEP team, periodically review \nand if appropriate, revise the IEP as the Detention Center learns new information about each \nchild, and keep the IEP in a place easily accessible to educational staff.   \n \n\n17 \n \nF.  Mississippi Should Provide the Services Described in a Student’s IEP From the \nPrevious School District. \n \nOnce the Detention Center has promptly obtained the child’s IEP, staff should review it \nand determine how the Detention Center will implement its requirements.  FAPE must be \nprovided to students with IEPs who move into new school districts and enroll in new schools in \nthe same school year through services comparable to those described in the student’s IEP from \nhis home school in the absence of adequate justification for changes in services.  IEPs must be \nappropriately implemented and should include collection and reporting of data on student \nprogress.  \n \n* * * * * \n \nFor children with disabilities who find themselves involved in the criminal justice \nsystem, the stakes are high.  These children often are “already at the margins,” with the \npossibility of receiving an appropriate education as an important “means to recast one’s future \nand enhance life choices.”  Buckley v. State Corr. Inst. Pine Grove, 98 F. Supp.3d 704,720 (M.D. \nPa. 2015) (finding a denial of a free appropriate public education to an incarcerated youth who \nwas placed in solitary confinement).  Nevertheless, children with disabilities, who are already \nincarcerated at disproportionate rates, often are denied their right to an appropriate education \nwhile institutionalized.  Id. (noting that even though “these are young people whose own actions \nhave propelled them into correctional custody . . . like all IDEA-eligible students, [plaintiff] was \nstill entitled to an appropriate education”).  Children who already suffer the disruption of \ndetention that keeps them from their home school should not also be deprived of their right to a \nfree appropriate public education while detained. \n \nThe cumulative effect on children of Mississippi’s non-compliance with IDEA at the \nDetention Center is significant.  The Detention Center is small, but it houses large numbers of \nchildren each year because children come and go throughout the year, and they are sometimes \nrepeatedly confined many times in a year or in quick succession.  Some confinements cause a \nchild to miss school for weeks or months in his or her home school, and Mississippi’s ongoing \nfailure to provide federally-mandated special education services exacerbates the harm Detention \nCenter children suffer from repeated interruptions in their education.  The Detention Center \naccepts children from 21 other counties in Mississippi, so the effects of its special education \nservices are felt throughout the state.  \n \nIn the context of a short-stay facility like the Detention Center, reliable IDEA compliance \nshould be a priority.  If a child is only at the Detention Center for a short time, an unnecessary \ndelay in obtaining the child’s records from the home school or conducting Child Find can mean \nthat Mississippi misses the opportunity to meet the special education needs of that child.  \nBecause children cycle through short-stay facilities repeatedly, Mississippi should develop \nespecially robust and reliable systems to reduce the risk of errors and confusion that can cost a \nchild the special education services to which he or she is entitled.  \n \n \n \n\n18 \nc-------~B()GauBe_tl!e_Stat()-ef~MissiBsippi-and-tl!e-Beard-ef-Edueatien· are-new-aeting-as-the-loeal \neducational agency for Leflore County, the state has an opportunity to model IDEA compliance \nfor all local educational agencies and other public agencies across Mississippi.  Both within the \nDetention Center, and across Leflore County, the state should take this opportunity to identify \nchildren with disabilities who are in need of special education services, develop, review, and as \nappropriate, revise IEPs to meet their needs, and implement those IEPs to ensure that all children \nhave the opportunity to access educational opportunities.  As noted previously in this letter, \nchildren with disabilities, particularly children with emotional and behavioral disorders, are \ndisproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system and are therefore at risk of \nplacement in the Detention Center and similar facilities.  Providing children with disabilities with \nthe special education, related services and supports that they need in school may prevent them \nfrom ever entering the Detention Center's front door. \nIt is in the best interests of the Detention Center children to resolve the IDEA violations \nthere as expeditiously as possible.  We hope you share our view that a collaborative approach by \nall parties would be most productive, and we are willing to engage in meaningful negotiations to \naddress the Detention Center's IDEA violations.  In light ofthe length of our investigation and \nthe continued IDEA violations in spite of repeated notice, however, we cannot unduly delay \nfiling for relief in federal court if a solution cannot be found promptly. \nPlease note that this letter is a public document.  It will be posted on the Civil Rights \nDivision's website. \nAs you know, our Special Litigalion Section is handling this matter.  The Chief of the \nSpecial Litigation Section, Steven H.
