    "summary": "<p>On November 25, 2008, the LatinoJustice PRLDEF of New York filed a complaint letter with the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division demanding that the federal government look into the Suffolk County Police Department (SCPD). They alleged that SCPD had deprived Latinos equal access to the law, both by failing to adequately investigate crimes committed against Latinos by whites and by discouraging Latinos from seeking assistance from local law enforcement agencies.</p>\r\n<p>Though it made no reference to the complaint letter, on September 1, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York initiated a joint investigation of the SCPD, pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 14141. On September 13, 2011, the United States issued a Technical Assistance Letter which provided preliminary observations, advice and recommendations. These recommendations included modifying policies for patrolling and policing in the Latino community, updating reporting policies of the police department's hate crimes unit, revising procedures for misconduct investigations, implementing greater supervision and accountability procedures, providing additional training to officers based on specific outcome markers, and enhancing community outreach programs.</p>\r\n<p>On January 13, 2014, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. The settlement incorporated the recommendations of the Technical Assistance Letter. Furthermore, it was agreed that a compliance coordinator would be appointed to coordinate compliance and implementation activity. Finally, SCPD agreed to produce a self-assessment compliance report every six months until the agreement terminated. The agreement was set to terminate in three years, but could end sooner &nbsp;if SCPD maintained substantial compliance with each of the settlement provisions for at least twelve months.</p>\r\n<p>The DOJ released compliance assessments on a regular basis. On June 23, 2017, the DOJ reported that the SCPD had made &ldquo;substantial progress&rdquo; in implementing the Settlement Agreement, particularly with respect to hate crimes and internal investigations of police misconduct, but &ldquo;considerable work remain[ed].&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2023, the DOJ released a report finding that SCPD reached substantial compliance with nearly all of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement, and SCPD was in partial compliance in the remaining three areas: traffic-stop data, policies related to language access, and Spanish-Language Access to the County&rsquo;s website. First, the SCPD&rsquo;s traffic stop data must be captured in a more reliable and transparent manner. Second, SCPD must monitor 911 calls to make sure that callers were getting sufficient access to language services. Third, SCPD must translate forms available on the website into other languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In May 2024, the DOJ issued a letter to SCPD notifying it of its termination of Sections IV, VI, and VII of the Settlement Agreement following SCPD's maintain substantial compliance with the provisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over a year later, on August 12, 2025, The DOJ released a final report marking the successful completion of the agreement between the DOJ and SCSP. The DOJ found that SCPD implemented language assistance policies and deployed resources to ensure that people with Limited English Proficiency have meaningful access to police services. Moreover, the DOJ found that SCPD improved reporting and supervision throughout the department. Last, the DOJ found that SCPD also improved policies, training, and tracking to better handle hate crimes and misconduct complaints.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the DOJ sent a letter to SCPD announcing the termination of the remaining sections of the Agreement. The matter is now closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n \nIn January 2014, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Suffolk County \nPolice Department (“SCPD” or the “Department”) entered into a Settlement Agreement \n(“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement”) to ensure that police services are provided to all \nmembers of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, in a manner that \ncomplies with the Constitution and laws of the United States.1  DOJ, as part of its responsibilities \nfor oversight of SCPD’s implementation of the Settlement Agreement, periodically reports on its \nassessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  This is the eighth Assessment Report, \nwhich focuses on conduct from the second half of 2018 and first half of 2019, but also addresses \nconduct from earlier periods where necessary.   \n \nSince we issued our last Assessment Report in October 2018 (the “Seventh Assessment \nReport”), DOJ representatives from both the Civil Rights Division and the United States \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York reviewed documents and materials \nprovided by SCPD, including copies of internal affairs investigations, a sample of entries in \nSCPD’s community relations daily activity reporting system, documentation regarding hate \ncrimes and language assistance, and other reports.  We also met with SCPD officials, SCPD \ncommand staff and other supervisors, and SCPD officers; toured precincts and participated in \nride-alongs with on-duty officers; attended training courses; and met with members of \nspecialized units, including the Hate Crimes Unit, the Internal Affairs Bureau, and the \nCommunity Response Bureau.  In addition, we met with advocates and solicited the views of the \nSuffolk County community, including the Latino community.  In conducting these activities, we \nconsulted with police practice experts with expertise in the areas of policing covered by the \nSettlement Agreement. \n \nIn addition, we met with again with the Commissioner of the Suffolk County Police \nDepartment, Geraldine Hart, to discuss the progress made to date and the enduring challenges \nthat remain.  We thank Commissioner Hart and the other SCPD officials with whom we met \nduring this assessment period, and we appreciate the cooperation and sustained commitment that \nSCPD and Suffolk County leadership continue to show in addressing the requirements of the \nAgreement.  We also thank the many members of the Suffolk County community who have met \nwith us and provided us with invaluable feedback.  The Department also has provided us with \nupdated information about changes it has implemented since our visit in October 2018, as noted \nin this report.   \n  \nThis Assessment Report is divided into two sections.  First, we provide a compliance \nrating for each provision of the Settlement Agreement.  Second, we provide a more detailed \nanalysis of SCPD’s successes and challenges to date in each main area of the Agreement:  1) \nbias-free policing; 2) hate crimes and hate incidents; 3) language assistance; 4) allegations of \npolice misconduct; 5) community engagement; and (6) policies and practices. \n \n \n                                                            \n1  This Agreement is available in both English and Spanish at https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section-\ncases-and-matters0#police.  \n2 | P a ge  \n \n\n \n \n \nII.   CURRENT COMPLIANCE RATINGS \n \nSection IX of the Settlement Agreement provides that the United States will assess and \nreport on SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  See Agreement at 19-20.  The compliance \nratings below represent the United States’ current assessment of SCPD’s compliance with each \narea of the Agreement.  While Section III of this Report provides a more detailed analysis of \nSCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, these ratings are included to provide SCPD and the \nSuffolk County community with a clear and accurate summary of progress to date, as well as \nareas that remain most in need of attention.   \n \nThe definition of each rating type is as follows: \n \n•  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  \n•  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.    \n•  “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement. \n•  “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation. \n \n \nStatus of \nSettlement Agreement Area \nCompliance  \nIII.

Continued Delivery of Bias-Free Policing  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Policies and Procedures \nCompliance \n   c.  Traffic-Stop Data  Partial Compliance \n   d.  Training  Partial Compliance \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD has committed to ensure that its police services are \n“equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that promotes broad community \nengagement and confidence in the Department” and that all “members of the public receive equal \nprotection of the law, without bias based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or \nsexual orientation, and in accordance with the rights, privileges, and immunities secured or \nprotected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.”  Agreement ¶  III(a) at 4.  To bring \nthese provisions to fruition, the Department must develop and implement a robust system of \ntraining, supervision, data collection, and accountability mechanisms that ensure its law \nenforcement duties are being performed free of impermissible bias.   \n \nThe Department continues to be in partial compliance with this provision, but remains on \ntrack to achieve substantial compliance once it is able to deliver bias-free policing training to all \nSCPD officers and once it is able to appropriately analyze the data it has recently begun \ncollecting.   \n   \n1.  Policies and Procedures  \n5 | P a ge  \n \n\n \nWe previously rated SCPD in substantial compliance with the policies and procedures \nprovisions of the Agreement.  See Sixth Assessment Report at 6; see also Agreement ¶ III(a) - \n(b) at 4-5.  As we have noted before, ensuring that SCPD members adhere to these policies in \npractice will require additional work, specifically, through appropriate data collection and \nanalyses, which continues to be a work in progress for the Department, as discussed below.  \n  \n2.  Traffic-Stop Data \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD must collect accurate traffic-stop data and analyze it for \nindications of bias in order to ensure bias-free policing.  See Agreement III(c) at 6.  As we \ndetailed in our last assessment report, SCPD recently took a number of steps towards compliance \nin this area.  See Seventh Assessment Report at 6-8.   \n \nMost significantly, the Department transitioned from a computerized data terminal \nsystem designed by an outside vendor to one developed and maintained by SCPD’s information \ntechnology (IT) unit, which gave SCPD greater control over the data collection fields and will \nultimately improve the Department’s ability to analyze up-to-date data.  In order to complete this \ntransition, the Department’s IT unit began designing the data collection module last winter, and \nworked with DOJ to ensure that all necessary data fields were included.  Prior to launching the \nrevamped system, the Department also conducted beta-testing with a select group of patrol \nofficers.  This process helped identify shortcomings and allowed them to be corrected before the \nsystem was reintroduced throughout the Department.  The new system can track a full range of \nrequired data points so that officers can collect – and the Department can analyze –factors \nrelevant to ensuring bias-free policing practices.  The revamped system also addresses the \nshortcomings that existed in the previous iteration of this program. \n \nDuring the last rating period, it came to our attention that the traffic stop data being \npublicized on SCPD’s website under the new system was not as robust as the data published \nunder the old system.  Specifically, the data lacked any geographical data regarding where traffic \nstops had occurred – which used to be provided under the old system.  We raised this concern \nwith SCPD, as the development of the new system was enacted to increase, not diminish, \ntransparency.  To its credit, SCPD—specifically its recently hired data analyst—promptly \naddressed this concern.  We appreciate this problem solving.      \n \nGoing forward, it remains critical that SCPD manage the data it is collecting and review \nit on a regular basis to ensure it is reliable.  Specifically, we renew our recommendation that \nSCPD precinct supervisors develop specific protocols for the substantive review of traffic-stop \ndata as part of supervisors’ regular supervisory activities and that SCPD provide updated training \nfor supervisors.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 7; Fifth Assessment Report at 6-7; Sixth \nAssessment Report at 7, Seven Assessment Report at 7.  We understand that SCPD now has a \nplan to implement that recommendation by amending its traffic stop data policy to specifically \nrequire such supervisory review, which would represent a significant step forward.  It is also \nimportant that the Department develop a robust plan for the analysis of this data.  As a positive \nstep forward, the Department has successfully procured funding for an outside consultant, which \nengagement will be finalized in the next several months.  We encourage the Department to begin \n6 | P a ge  \n \n\nworking on protocols for data analysis as soon as possible to ensure that this necessary measure \ncan be implemented effectively.  \n \n3.  Training \n \nThe Agreement requires that all sworn officers receive training on bias-free policing at \nleast annually.  See Agreement at 6-7.  This training is to “emphasize that discriminatory \npolicing, in the form of either selective enforcement or non-enforcement of the law, including the \nselecting or rejecting of particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited by policy and will \nsubject officers to disciplinary action.”  Id.  The Agreement also sets forth specific elements that \nSCPD must incorporate into its bias-free training.  Id.   \n \nWe found SCPD in substantial compliance with this requirement in our last assessment \nreport, as the training SCPD now provides is thorough and clear, and it provides officers with an \nin-depth understanding of the psychological and situational factors that can result in bias \ninfluencing law enforcement outcomes, and the techniques that officers should use to prevent \nthis from happening.  We did not observe the training during this rating period but will reassess it \nduring the next rating period.  If the training remains substantively equivalent to our last \nobservations, SCPD is poised to come into substantial compliance with this provision once it \ndelivers this training to all SCPD officers.  Given the large size of the Department, this is a \nprocess that will take time, but we have met with SCPD to discuss how to ensure this transpires \nas quickly as possible.   \n  \nB.  HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \n \nSubstantial \nIV. HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Training \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Tracking and Reporting \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Quality Assurance \nCompliance \n \nGiven that SCPD has launched a mapping system that will substantially improve SCPD’s \nability to track and analyze hate crimes, we found that SCPD was in substantial compliance with \nthe hate crimes portions of the Agreement in our last assessment report.  SCPD remains in \nsubstantial compliance with these provisions. \n \nNonetheless, as set forth below, several issues arose during this rating period that require \ncontinued attention.  SCPD has been proactive in addressing these issues to date, which has \nenabled the Department to remain in substantial compliance.  Continued focus on these areas is \n7 | P a ge  \n \n\nessential to ensuring the Department tracks and responds to hate crimes in a manner that \ncomplies with the Agreement.   \n \n1.  Training  \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD must ensure that all officers receive annual hate crimes and \nhate incident training.  See Agreement ¶ IV(a) at 7.  We found SCPD to be in substantial \ncompliance with this provision of the Agreement in October 2016.  See Fourth Assessment \nReport at 9-10.  The Department continues to deliver the approved training and remains in \nsubstantial compliance.     \n \n2.  Tracking, Reporting, and Pattern Analyses \n \nIn our last assessment report, we noted that the Department had developed and fully \nimplemented a mapping system for hate crimes and hate incidents that comports with this \nrequirement.  The mapping system continues to be used appropriately by SCPD, and the system \npromises to assist SCPD in identifying patterns of problematic conduct.     \n \nDuring this rating period, however, SCPD realized a deficiency in the tracking of the \nparticular group targeted by each particular incident, which caused some incidents not to be \nreported in the cumulative statistics.  This deficiency stemmed from shortcomings in the \ncomputerized form for reporting hate crimes.  When an officer flags an event as a possible hate \ncrime, the officer checks a box on the electronic form identifying the specific hate-crime \nmotivation.  The record is then referred to the Hate Crimes Unit (“HCU”).  If the HCU finds that \nthe report does not describe a hate crime but instead a hate incident, the HCU manually changes \nthe form.  At this point, however, the system was “unchecking” the hate crime motivation box, \nwhich led to the deletion of the specific motivation from the report.  This resulted in deficient \nforms for hate incidents that were originally identified as hate crimes.   \n \nSCPD has been proactive in appropriately responding to this deficiency.  Since identifying \nthe issue, SCPD has reviewed all 2018 reports to identify the motivation for the hate incident and \nupdated the reports accordingly.  SCPD has also taken steps to modify the computerized form to \nprevent this issue from continuing to occur.  Because of its prompt attention to this issue, SCPD \ndemonstrated that it had the institutional capacity to identify and correct problems in this area, \nand as a result remained in substantial compliance notwithstanding these events.               \n \nFinally, we again commend the Department’s commitment to making the mapping data \npublicly available in its annual report, and encourage the Department to initiate production of its \nfirst report as soon as possible to bolster transparency regarding this important issue. \n3.  Quality Assurance \n \nThe Agreement requires SCPD to “implement a policy describing its HCU quality \nassurance process that ensures that HCU investigations follow proper techniques and \nprocedures,” and that SCPD will conduct random audits of HCU investigations and any \ncorrective actions taken because of the audits.  See Agreement ¶ IV(c) at 7-8.  SCPD remains in \nsubstantial compliance with these requirements.   \n8 | P a ge  \n \n\nDuring this assessment period, SCPD identified an issue regarding the categorization of \nhate crimes and hate incidents that it must continue to address.  Currently, the Department \ncategorizes hate crimes and hate incidents by the type of victim the crime involved, e.g., “anti-\nLatino,” “anti-Jewish,” or “anti-Muslim.”  As a result, certain incidents are currently categorized \nas exhibiting hate towards a particular group even though the specific conduct in question may \nbe exhibiting hate towards a broader component of the community.  For, instance, officers \ncurrently record graffiti of a swastika as having only an “anti-Jewish” motivation even though \nthe graffiti may also be intended by white supremacists to target other groups.  Properly \ncategorizing hate crimes and incidents issue is complex but is central to ensuring quality \nreporting, tracking and response.  We will continue to work with SCPD, with the assistance of \nour experts and experts from other departments, to identify the best approach to properly \nrecording this conduct.       \n \nC.

Community Survey   Partial Compliance  \n  \nThe Agreement requires SCPD to develop and implement language access policies and \npractices so that persons who are Limited English Proficiency (LEP) have meaningful access to \npolice services.  See Agreement ¶ V at 8-11.  Effective communication with LEP individuals is \ncritical for effective policing and public safety.  Although SCPD has continued to make progress \n9 | P a ge  \n \n\nin this area, and it continues to improve its excellent Language Access Policy (LAP) (Rules & \nProcedures, Ch. 26, Sec. 5), SCPD’s implementation and monitoring require additional \nimprovement.  A substantial gap remains between the principles espoused in the LAP and \nexecution of the policy by officers and supervisors in the field.   SCPD records show that SCPD \npersonnel often fail to use language interpretation services when communicating with LEP \nindividuals, whether witnesses, suspects, or members of the public, especially during \nenforcement actions, criminal investigations, interrogations, and detentions, leading to \nineffective communications.   \n \n1.   Language Access Policy/ Language Line Order  \n  \nWe have determined that SCPD’s LAP is in substantial compliance with the language \naccess policy and language line order provisions of the Agreement.  As a matter of technical \nassistance, and based upon our observations regarding the obstacles that prevent SCPD from \nsuccessfully implementing the LAP in practice, we make the following recommendations for \nchanges to the LAP to help improve the delivery of language assistance services: \n \n(a)  Section IV.E.3.e(2)(a), on page 10 of the LAP version we received, notes that if a \ntemporary interpreter during an exigency enables police services to be rendered, officers \ndo not need to use an interpretation service.  This is appropriate.  However, we \nrecommend that the LAP reflect language that advises, once the exigency ends, officers \nshould switch to approved language access services.  Finally, we recommend that the \nLAP direct all personnel to record in the ORS (the Online Reporting System) the use of \nboth temporary and authorized interpreters or bilingual members of service.  \n \n (b)  It is critical that officers understand the importance of not using children to interpret,  \nexcept perhaps as a last resort in an exigency.  We have received reports that children \ncontinue to be used as interpreters, even on domestic violence calls.  This is particularly \nconcerning  We recommend that SCPD insert language into the LAP reminding officers \nof the likely negative emotional impacts on children who are used as temporary \ninterpreters during police-civilian contacts, and understand that SCPD intends to do so . \n \n (c)  The Agreement acknowledges the importance of providing complaint and \ncompliment forms in Spanish, to allow LEP individuals to make complaints or \ncompliments regarding their experiences with SCPD.  The Agreement also requires that \ncomplaints in other languages “will be processed in the same manner as are citizen \ncomplaints originally received in English.”  See Agreement ¶ ¶ V.a.iv, V.a.vi.  We \nlearned during our tour that notifications to LEP individuals of complaint dispositions are \nat times provided only in English.  SCPD reports that  both R&P §  26.5 and 5.2  dictate \nthat all correspondence should be in the language of the recipient and that it has \naddressed this specific concern.         \n \n2.  Implementation of Policy on Persons with LEP   \n \nImplementation of the LAP should be improved.  Specifically, the Community Relations \nBureau’s reports for July, August, and September 2018 show that that field officers frequently \nreject the Communications Section’s determination that certain 911 calls require language access \n10 | P a ge  \n \n\nservices, which SCPD refers to as “LIMA” calls.  In each month during the previous rating \nperiod, between 60-100% of LIMA calls—call that the Communications Section believe require \nlanguage access services—did not result in the use of a Department-approved language \nassistance resource.  Clearly, not all LIMA calls require language assistance; for example, when \nan LEP individual calls 911 regarding a traffic accident, but the drivers and witnesses at the \nscene are all proficient in English.  However, officers too often inaccurately reject the LIMA \ndesignation without properly assessing whether individuals are LEP and require interpretation \nservices.  As one indication of this fact, Internal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”) follow-up calls to \ncomplainants who are LEP determined that officers failed to provide needed language access \nservices almost 40% of the time.  Further, desk audits by the IAB—in which an IAB supervisor \npretending to be an LEP individual called a precinct—found similar non-compliance.  As a \nresult, LEP individuals are too often unable to receive adequate language assistance, and officers \nare too often not able to obtain accurate information during a call.  Precinct-level training, for \nofficers and supervisors, is needed to change this behavior.    SCPD reports that, in 2019, the rate \nof use of language assistance services has improved by 8.5%.  This is a positive trend that we \nhope will continue.  The Commissioner has also expressed that maintaining this progress is a \npriority for the Department, and has recently issued directives regarding this issue.   \n \nWe also note the need for training and supervisory review of the customer service \nprovided by precinct desk officers, who are often the first contact that individuals have with \nSCPD.  We continue to receive reports that the level of customer service provided to LEP callers \nby precinct desk personnel varies from barely adequate to poor.  Desk supervisors must ensure \nthat officers treat all members of the public with appropriate respect and see themselves as \nambassadors of the agency.  Desk officers also are not sufficiently documenting LEP contacts \nand use of language assistance services. We also continue to receive reports that LEP individuals \ncoming into contact with Suffolk officers are not receiving appropriate, courteous service in the \nfield.  We understand that, since our last tour, the Department has implemented several measures \nto address this problem.  For example, in December 2019, SCPD hired Spanish-speaking civilian \nemployees to be present at particular precinct front desks.  We will continue to monitor progress \nin this area.        \n \nOne solution to these issues is better supervisory oversight and intra-departmental \nmonitoring of language access services.  To ensure the LAP is implemented appropriately, \nsupervisors should monitor individual officers’ requests for language assistance and review \ndocumentation to ensure that such assistance was administered properly.  More attention to the \nCommunity Relations Bureau’s (CRB) monthly LIMA reports sent to every precinct commander \nalso would assist in ensuring proper language access services.  Some supervisors we spoke to \nseemed not even aware of the data, much less how to analyze it or utilize it to improve services.  \nWe recommend that CRB prepare a presentation regarding its LIMA report and uniform review \nprocedures for delivery to all Inspectors and Deputy Inspectors, which, among other things, \nexplains what the reports mean, how they can be used, and get feedback on how they can be \nmade even stronger.  This will help SCPD develop the most useful possible report and improve \nLAP services while also emphasizing to command staff the importance of LAP issues.   \n \nWe were impressed by a promising oversight and monitoring model independently \ndeveloped in the Third Precinct by Deputy Inspector Milagros Soto, who, with support from \nInspector John Rowan, has applied her Internal Affairs experience and knowledge of the LEP \n11 | P a ge  \n \n\ncommunity to create tools which allow analysis of language access services.  This could serve as \na model for every precinct commander, and we recommended when we were on our tour that \nSCPD roll it out in every precinct.  We understand that SCPD has now done so.   \n \nThe ability to collect and analyze data has been greatly aided by the recent hiring of a \ndata analyst, who has made efficient progress setting up a reporting system for LIMA calls.  He \nhas worked with IT to connect directly to the SCPD databases and written code that makes the \nprocess of simplifying the data into a report repeatable each month with minimal effort.  SCPD’s \nefforts to implement the LAP would be bolstered if it made better use of this data.   \n \nWe note, however, that the current data system tracks only patrol officers’ provision of \nlanguage assistance.  SCPD should also create a system to require the crime control units, \ndetective squads, and specialized units to track language assistance.   See Agreement, ¶  V.a.x.  \nSimilarly, IAB audits of language access service provision should include detectives and desk \nofficers.    Ensuring these other units implement the LAP is essential to SCPD’s efforts of \nproviding appropriate language services to all LEP individuals.   \n   \nIt is also critical that SCPD display in languages other than English current versions of \nlanguage access postings and literature.  See Agreement at ¶ V.a.  As noted above, we once again \nfound different versions of the community survey and LAP at the headquarters’ front desk and \nother precinct locations.  A more thorough and regular language access document audit must be \nconducted in all of the precincts to remove outdated and unnecessary materials (including all \nCommunity Surveys, which are in the process of redevelopment).  Likewise, all posters that \nadvise the public of their language access rights should be prominently displayed, together with \nother notifications of the public’s rights and important law enforcement communications. \n \n3.  Spanish Language Access to the SCPD Website  \n  \nThe SCPD reported in 2018 that it had migrated its website over the past several months \nto a new platform.  Based on what was visible during our review at that time, many entries were \nnot translated into Spanish.  We have reviewed the website recently, however, and were pleased \nto see that almost all information in English is also available now in Spanish.  The few remaining \nlinks which are not translated can easily be fixed, and we expect  SCPD will do so.  Given the \nprogress that has been made in this area, we now find it in substantial compliance.  We commend \nSCPD for its efforts over the last year.  \n   \n4.  Incentives for Interpreters  \n  \nWe understand that the corps of bilingual officers and interpreters continues to grow.  \nThis demonstrates that the current incentives for personnel participation in supporting the LAP \nare sufficient and having their intended effect.    \n \n5.  Consultation with the Latino Community & Community Survey   \n \nThe Department’s contacts with Latino community leaders have ebbed and flowed.  As \nwe have recommended, the Department has needed more communication both with long-time \nadvocates and new community members and advocates.  We understand that since last year, the \n12 | P a ge  \n \n\nCommissioner and her staff have met more frequently and in different locations than in the past.  \nWe commend this effort and urge continued meeting and consultation with community members \nand advocates.  \n \nWe have also recommended that SCPD invite community members to participate in, or \nobserve its initiatives, such as its training and community survey development, so that \ncommunity members are aware of the SCPD’s efforts and can provide feedback that enhances \nthe Department’s cultural and linguistic competence.  When we toured in 2018, Latino \ncommunity advocates reported that they were still awaiting confirmation of an opportunity to \nobserve the LAP training.  We understand that this has now occurred and that other programs, \nincluding Hate Crimes and Bias Free Policing training, have been viewed and commented on by \nLatino community members and advocates.  Training decks for the online VIPER (Video \nInteractive Police Education Resource) program and other training should also be shared with \nadvocates to generate support among community and SCPD personnel for the Department’s \npolicy and commitment to language access.   \n \nDuring our visit, we received an update from CRB regarding the status of SCPD’s efforts \nto contract with a third party (ideally, a local university) to develop and administer annual \ncommunity surveys.  We understand that funding has now been obtained to develop the survey, \nwhich is expected to be conducted in the first part of 2020.  \n \n6.  Language Assistance Training   \n  \nWe did not observe the language assistance training on this tour, but we have found it in \nsubstantial compliance in the past and have no reason to think that this has changed.  We \nunderstand that the CRB also conducted one round of VIPER training on the LAP; the training \nmaterials should be provided to the training section managers (as well as community advocates, \nas noted above), to ensure that the language access training is in sync with the instructions \nprovided elsewhere in the Department.  We also understand that SCPD has contracted with a \nprofessor from Suffolk County Community College to conduct Spanish language training for \nofficers who are marginally fluent in Spanish. We commend SCPD for initiating this program.   \n \nD.  ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \n \nSubstantial \nVI. ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Reporting Misconduct \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Investigation of Misconduct \nCompliance \n \nUnder the police misconduct reporting requirements of the Agreement, SCPD must have \na policy that requires all members to report allegations of discriminatory policing, ensures that \nall complaints are investigated, and allows third-persons to submit complaints on behalf of \n13 | P a ge  \n \n\nvictims.  Agreement ¶ V(a) at 11.  The Agreement also includes various provisions concerning \nthe investigation of misconduct, which are aimed at ensuring that all complaints are thoroughly \ninvestigated.  See Agreement ¶ V(b) at 11-12.  The Department attained substantial compliance \nwith this section of the Agreement in our Seventh Assessment Report in October 2018 and \nremains in substantial compliance for this Assessment. \n1.  Reporting Misconduct \n \nThe Department’s ongoing implementation of its Civilian Complaint Procedure, Order \n15-56, means it remains in compliance with the three requirements of the Reporting Misconduct \nsection of the Agreement dealing with:  (1) members’ duty to report allegations of discriminatory \npolicing, (2) ensuring that the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) investigates all complaints \nregardless of how they are submitted, and (3) allowing third parties to file complaints on behalf \nof victims.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 16; Agreement  ¶ VI(a) at 11.  The Department also \ncontinues to keep complainants apprised of the status of their complaint per its voluntarily \nadopted policy, SCPD Directive, Order No. 17-01, Mar. 17, 2017, that we have previously \ncommended.  These efforts to be transparent in the investigative process and responsive to \ncomplainants from the community should steadily improve public perception of the internal \naffairs process and of SCPD as a whole.  We will continue to monitor this section of the \nAgreement, including any related policies, to ensure that SCPD remains in substantial \ncompliance. \n \n2.  Investigating Misconduct \n \nThe provisions of the Agreement that address the Department’s misconduct \ninvestigations are designed to ensure that SCPD’s misconduct complaints are timely and \nthoroughly investigated, that IAB has qualified SCPD members serving as investigators, and that \nthe Department tracks and analyzes IAB investigations to ensure their quality and identify issues.  \nSee Agreement ¶  VI(b) at 11-12.  The Department remains in substantial compliance with these \nrequirements. \nBuilding on its improved recruiting of investigators, (see Seventh Assessment Report at \n14), SCPD has three captains assigned to IAB who lead three teams of five or six investigators.  \nEach investigator carries a caseload of about eight cases, which appears to be a manageable and \nappropriate number.  As a result, SCPD has made further progress in reducing its number of \naging or backlogged cases, with only 13 such investigations at the time of our last tour.  Five of \nthe backlogged cases were delayed for reasons beyond SCPD’s control, such as being put on \nhold at the direction of the prosecutor due to a pending criminal case or inquiry.  SCPD has also \nbeen providing relevant training for investigators, including a basic criminal investigation course \nin December 2018, and an advanced criminal investigator course for five IAB investigators in \nJanuary 2019.   \nSCPD remains in compliance with this section of the Agreement.  As discussed in the \ncommunity engagement section below, however, IAB can make further improvements in gaining \ntrust and support from members of the community while they investigate complaints.   Relatedly, \nwe note renewed public concerns regarding a specific incident in 2016 involving a family \nseeking SCPD’s assistance in investigating the disappearance of their teenage daughter.  In April \n2019, it was reported that SCPD had been provided the full video-recording of that encounter. \n14 | P a ge  \n \n\nAlthough it occurred over three years ago, the underlying incident—and the manner in which the \nSCPD investigated it—directly relate to issues throughout the Settlement Agreement.  In the \ninterest of promoting transparency and improving community trust—especially in Suffolk \nCounty’s immigrant and LEP communities—we encourage SCPD to consider ways that it may \nreport publicly on the results of its review of the video and the overall investigation into this \nincident.  \nWe will continue to monitor all aspects of this section of the Agreement to ensure that \ninvestigations continue to meet the requirements of the Agreement.   \n \nE.    COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \n \nVII. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Maintaining Community Relationships  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Community Liaison Officers \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   d.  Community Response Bureau \nCompliance \n   e.  Community Outreach  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial  \n   f.  Social Media and Notification Systems \nCompliance \n \n SCPD remains in partial compliance with its overall Community Engagement \nobligations under the Settlement Agreement although it is much closer to achieving \nsubstantial compliance.  SCPD has developed a robust approach to community engagement \nsince entry of the Settlement Agreement in 2014.  It has created new positions in \nheadquarters and in each precinct to encourage and coordinate interaction and \ncommunication between the Department and the community.  It holds regular meetings at \nthe precinct level and countywide and is beginning to incorporate patrol officers into its \nengagement efforts.  SCPD’s Community Liaison Officers (CLO), Community Oriented \nPolicing Enforcement (COPE) officers, and the command staff in its Community Response \nBureau (CRB) continue to devote substantial time and energy toward community \nengagement. And we remain impressed with the work of CRB, in particular Sergeant \nKathleen Kenneally.  SCPD has hired a Latino Community Liaison in headquarters to work \ndirectly with the Commissioner.  The position has potential, and the individual in the \nposition appears eager to serve the community.  The current Commissioner and SCPD \nleadership have strengthened SCPD’s commitment to community engagement.  We \ncommend the Commissioner for the dedication she has demonstrated to building a better \nrelationship with the Suffolk County community.  \n15 | P a ge  \n \n\n \nHowever, the Department’s initiatives still have not sufficiently filtered down to \nprecinct officers.  As we noted in our last report, officers need to better understand that \nimproving community relations is an integral part of their daily duties and not limited to \nparticipation in organized events.  Additionally, SCPD needs to be more proactive, analytical, \nand strategic to engage with less traditional partners and the more underserved parts of the \nSuffolk County community.  It also needs to enhance its efforts to address current questions \nand concerns of the community through outreach and distribution of informational materials. \n \n1.  Maintaining Community Relationships and Community Outreach \n \nSCPD has maintained the Partial Compliance rating that it had achieved in these areas in \npast reporting periods.  We continue to be impressed with the array of activities that the CLO and \nCOPE officers plan and execute.  The Department and its individual precincts continue to \nmaintain a busy schedule of community outreach events, including quarterly meetings with the \nLatino Community Outreach Committee, monthly community meetings at the precincts, and \npopular programs such as sports programs for local youth and trainings targeted at educating \nabout the risks of opioid addiction.  Patrol officers appear to be attending community outreach \nevents organized by the CLO and COPE officers in their precincts more often, including \nattending their precinct’s monthly community meetings.  In addition, SCPD is continuing to \nmeet its obligation of producing and publishing annual reports with its own analysis of CRB’s \nsuccesses, areas in need of improvement, and strategies for making improvements, including \nposting these reports on its own website.  Further, in our last report, we advised SCPD to \nbroaden its outreach, and SCPD has done so, in part by scheduling meetings at different times of \nthe day and in different locations, such as churches and community centers.  We commend this \neffort but caution that, while SCPD reaches out to new participants in these meetings, it should \nnot ignore or exclude community representatives who have been vocal advocates in the past.  \n \nSeveral remaining challenges must be addressed to achieve substantial compliance with \nthe Agreement.  First, as we stated in our last report, SCPD needs to develop an effective \nsystem for tracking and analysis of community outreach events.  We recognize that SCPD has \nbeen trying to develop such a system for a significant amount of time and that the project is \nunderway.  But it still has not done so.  Until it is completed and fully implemented, SCPD \ncannot demonstrate that its officers are regularly conducting and accurately recording their \ncommunity outreach work, or that community contacts and supervisors at all levels possess \nsufficient information to measure and analyze the effectiveness of community outreach.  This \nin turn impacts SCPD’s ability to appropriately share information across precincts, to identify \npotential gaps in community outreach, and to strategize about how to improve the effectiveness \nand breadth of community outreach.   \n \nSecond, we also repeat that SCPD still does not fully comply with the requirement that \nit “engage the public through the dissemination of public information on a regular basis.”  \nAgreement ¶ VII(a) at 12-13.  There remains uncertainty about who has the responsibility for \ngenerating and disseminating such materials.   We understand that SCPD has assigned this duty \nto the CRB, and we look forward to confirming this during our next site visit.  As to materials \ngenerated by IAB, given the particular divide between IAB and the community noted earlier in \n16 | P a ge  \n \n\nthis Report, we also encourage IAB to look for ways of bolstering transparency and public trust.  \nIdentifying opportunities to help educate and inform people about the work of IAB will help \nIAB promote public confidence in SCPD’s accountability processes.   \n \nFinally, SCPD must also develop and implement a community survey, consistent with \nthe requirements set forth in paragraph VII.d.3.  We understand that this survey, too, is under \ndevelopment and should be rolled out sometime in 2020.  \n \n2.  Community Liaison Officers, Community Oriented Policing Enforcement, and the  \n  Community Response Bureau \n \nAs we noted above, SCPD has maintained a rating of substantial compliance with the \nprovisions of the Agreement relating to the responsibilities of the CLO and COPE officers.  \nWe continue to be impressed with the dedication and expertise of the individual officers in \nthese roles.  We also note that the Commissioner has hired a community member from \nPatchogue to work part-time in headquarters as a liaison to the Latino community.  This is an \nexcellent idea, and we hope over time that the liaison is able to successfully expand outreach \nopportunities and improve relations with the Latino community.   \n \nFinally, we note that several people in the community raised significant concerns \nabout activities of School Resource Officers (SROs).  The Agreement requires that, “in all of \nits policing operations, SCPD will maintain robust community relationships and engage \nconstructively with the community to ensure collaborative problem-solving, ethical and bias-\nfree policing, and community confidence in the department” and that “SCPD will maintain \ncommunity and problem-oriented policing principles in its policing operations.”  To meet \nthese principles, we encourage SCPD to increase its communication with the local Latino \ncommunity – youth in particular – regarding SRO practices. \n \nOverall, we commend SCPD for its efforts to date on its outreach efforts with the \nLatino community.  SCPD has made tremendous changes in the past five years.  We urge it to \nmake the adjustments outlined above necessary for it to come into substantial compliance with \nthis section. \n \nF.    POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY \n \nSubstantial \nVII. POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY \nCompliance  \n \nSCPD must “maintain policies and procedures that are consistent with [the] Agreement \nand that provide clear direction to ensure that officers and civilian employees enforce the law \neffectively, ethically, and constitutionally.”  Agreement ¶ VIII(a) at 17.  The Agreement also \nrequires that SCPD ensures that “all officers who take [required] trainings will be required to \npass a test demonstrating a basic comprehension of the training material after it is presented.”  Id. \n¶ VIII(b).  The Department has met these requirements.  \n17 | P a ge  \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n \nIn January 2014, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Suffolk County \nPolice Department (“SCPD” or the “Department”) entered into a Settlement Agreement \n(“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement”) to ensure that police services are provided to all \nmembers of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, in a manner that \ncomplies with the Constitution and laws of the United States.1  DOJ, as part of its responsibilities \nfor oversight of SCPD’s implementation of the Settlement Agreement, periodically reports on its \nassessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  This is the seventh Assessment Report, \nwhich focuses on the first six months of 2018, but also addresses conduct from earlier periods \nwhere necessary.   \n \nSince we issued our last Assessment Report in March 2018 (the “Sixth Assessment \nReport”), DOJ representatives from both the Civil Rights Division and the United States \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York reviewed documents and materials \nprovided by SCPD, including copies of internal affairs investigations, a sample of entries in \nSCPD’s community relations daily activity reporting system, documentation regarding hate \ncrimes and language assistance, and other reports.  We also met with SCPD officials, SCPD \ncommand staff and other supervisors, and SCPD officers; toured precincts and participated in \nride-alongs with on-duty officers; attended training courses; and met with members of \nspecialized units, including the Hate Crimes Unit, the Internal Affairs Bureau, and the \nCommunity Response Bureau.  In addition, we met with advocates and solicited the views of the \nSuffolk County community, including the Latino community.  In conducting these activities, we \nconsulted with police practice experts with expertise in the areas of policing covered by the \nSettlement Agreement. \n \nIn addition, we met with the new Commissioner of the Suffolk County Police \nDepartment, Geraldine Hart, to discuss the progress made to date and the enduring challenges \nthat remain.  We thank Commissioner Hart and the other SCPD officials with whom we met \nduring this assessment period, and we appreciate the cooperation and sustained commitment that \nSCPD and Suffolk County leadership continue to show in addressing the requirements of the \nAgreement.  We also thank the many members of the Suffolk County community who have met \nwith us and provided us with invaluable feedback.  \n  \nThis Assessment Report is divided into two sections.  First, we provide a compliance \nrating for each provision of the Settlement Agreement.  Second, we provide a more detailed \nanalysis of SCPD’s successes and challenges to date in each main area of the Agreement:  1) \nbias-free policing; 2) hate crimes and hate incidents; 3) language assistance; 4) allegations of \npolice misconduct; and 5) community engagement. \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1  This Agreement is available in both English and Spanish at https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section-\ncases-and-matters0#police.  \n2 | P age \n \n\n \nII.   CURRENT COMPLIANCE RATINGS \n \nSection IX of the Settlement Agreement provides that the United States will assess and \nreport on SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  See Agreement at 19-20.  The compliance \nratings below represent the United States’ current assessment of SCPD’s compliance with each \narea of the Agreement.  While Section III of this Report provides a more detailed analysis of \nSCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, these ratings are included to provide SCPD and the \nSuffolk County community with a clear and accurate summary of progress to date, as well as \nareas that remain most in need of attention.   \n \nThe definition of each rating type is as follows: \n \n  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  \n  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.    \n  “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement. \n  “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation. \n \n \nStatus of \nSettlement Agreement Area \nCompliance  \nIII.

Training  Partial Compliance \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD has committed to ensure that its police services are \n“equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that promotes broad community \nengagement and confidence in the Department” and that all “members of the public receive equal \nprotection of the law, without bias based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or \nsexual orientation, and in accordance with the rights, privileges, and immunities secured or \nprotected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.”  Agreement III(a) at 4.  To bring \nthese provisions to fruition, the Department must develop and implement a robust system of \ntraining, supervision, data collection, and accountability mechanisms that ensure its law \nenforcement duties are being performed free of impermissible bias.   \n \nDuring the last assessment period, the Department has made significant progress in this \narea.  While there is still a significant amount of work that remains to ensure compliance with \nthis portion of the Agreement, in the last six months the Department has taken meaningful steps \nto put itself on the right track. \n   \n1.  Continued Delivery of Bias-Free Policing \n \nIn our Sixth Assessment Report, we noted that two main obstacles to SCPD achieving \nsubstantial compliance in this area remained:  (a) collecting appropriate traffic-stop data that \nhelps the Department analyze its conduct to ensure it is policing free from unlawful bias, and (b) \ndevelopment and delivery of training on bias-free policing.  See Sixth Assessment Report at 6.  \nWhile SCPD’s work is not yet complete and a rating of substantial compliance is not yet \n5 | P age \n \n\nappropriate, the strides SCPD has made in these two components, detailed below, represent the \nmost significant progress to date in the area of bias-free policing.  \n \n2.  Policies and Procedures  \n \nWe previously rated SCPD in substantial compliance with the policies and procedures \nprovisions of the Agreement.  See Sixth Assessment Report at 6; see also Agreement III(a) - (b) \nat 4-5.  As we have noted before, ensuring that SCPD members adhere to these policies in \npractice will require additional work, specifically, through appropriate data collection and \nanalyses, which continues to be a work in progress for the Department, as discussed below.  \n  \n3.  Traffic-Stop Data \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD must collect accurate traffic-stop data and analyze it for \nindications of bias in order to ensure bias-free policing.  See Agreement III(c) at 6.  This has \nbeen a significant challenge for the Department, as detailed in previous assessment reports.  See \nThird Assessment Report at 7-8; Fourth Assessment Report at 6-7; Fifth Assessment Report at 6-\n7; Sixth Assessment Report at 6.  During this rating period, however, SCPD finalized and \nimplemented a robust data collection system that is consistent with the objectives of the \nAgreement. \n \nA number of steps were necessary to bring this project to completion.  First, the \nDepartment transitioned from a computerized data terminal system designed by an outside \nvendor to one developed and maintained by SCPD’s information technology (IT) unit, which \ngave SCPD greater control over the data collection fields and will ultimately improve the \nDepartment’s ability to analyze up-to-date data.  In order to complete this transition, the \nDepartment’s IT unit began designing the data collection module last winter, and worked with \nDOJ to ensure that all necessary data fields were included.  See id.  This new system was initially \nlaunched on August 28, 2017, but within the first few hours of the system going into operation, \nofficers reported that the slowness of the system unnecessarily increased the time to complete a \nstop report.  Additionally, SCPD reported that officers found the design of the new system \ndifficult to navigate because the fields were not linear or easy to scroll through.  To correct these \nissues, the Department built an entirely separate database for stop reports.  The Department also \nredesigned the fields so that they are easy to scroll through and include gateway questions to \nstreamline the process (e.g., an answer of “no” to the question of whether there was a search \nwould drop all the attendant questions). \n \nPrior to launching the revamped system, the Department also conducted beta-testing with \na select group of patrol officers.  This process helped identify shortcomings and allowed them to \nbe corrected before the system was reintroduced throughout the Department. \n \nDuring our tour in April 2018, we observed the new system that had been launched \nthroughout the Department.  The system contains the full range of required data points so that \nofficers can collect – and the Department can analyze – all factors relevant to ensuring bias-free \npolicing practices.  The revamped system also address the shortcomings that existed in the \nprevious iteration of this program. \n \n6 | P age \n \n\nThis is a considerable step forward for the Department.  In order to achieve substantial \ncompliance, however, several steps must be taken.  First, it is critical that the Department ensure \nthat officers are fully using this system and collecting accurate and comprehensive data for each \ntraffic stop.  We will evaluate this during the next assessment period.  To that end, we renew our \nrecommendation that SCPD supervisors develop specific protocols for the substantive review of \ntraffic-stop data as part of supervisors’ regular supervisory activities and that SCPD provide \nupdated training for supervisors, many of whom have not received supervisor-specific training \nsince attaining the rank of sergeant.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 7; Fifth Assessment \nReport at 6-7; Sixth Assessment Report at 7.    Additionally, it is important that the Department \ndevelop a robust plan for the analysis of this data.  The Department has committed to the fact \nthat, once a year’s worth of data is collected, it will begin the analysis process and make its \nanalysis available to the public.  We encourage the Department to begin working on protocols for \ndata analysis as soon as possible to ensure that this necessary measure can be implemented \neffectively. \n \nFinally, in our last Assessment Report, we recommended that the Department collect \nbasic demographic data for its checkpoint stops (e.g., DWI, safety checkpoints).  We provided \nthe Department a sample form for collecting such data that would not impede its checkpoint \noperations and the Department has begun using this form.  We commend SCPD for its proactive \nwork in this area.   \n \n4.  Training \n \nThe Agreement requires that all sworn officers receive training on bias-free policing at \nleast annually.  See Agreement at 6-7.  This training is to “emphasize that discriminatory \npolicing, in the form of either selective enforcement or non-enforcement of the law, including the \nselecting or rejecting of particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited by policy and will \nsubject officers to disciplinary action.”  Id.  The Agreement also sets forth specific elements that \nSCPD must incorporate into its bias-free training.  Id.  As detailed in our previous reports, SCPD \nsuspended its initial bias-free policing training after we determined that it was deficient.  See \nFourth Assessment Report at 8; Fifth Assessment Report at 7.  Thereafter, SCPD attempted to \ncoordinate with the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States Department of Justice \non a revised training program, but in June 2017 OJP notified SCPD it had stopped providing \nprocedural justice and bias-free training assistance.  SCPD then met with training coordinators \nfrom a major-city police department that had obtained procedural justice and bias-free training in \nthe past.  This process is described in detail in our Sixth Assessment Report.  See Sixth \nAssessment Report at 8.   \n \nDuring the last rating period, SCPD used the information it acquired from the major-city \npolice department to develop its own bias-free policing and procedural justice training.  Once a \ncurriculum was developed, the Department also approached community stakeholders to observe \nan initial version of the training and provide feedback.  SCPD met with these community \nstakeholders on several occasions, and diligently worked to incorporate the comments received. \n \nThe training that has resulted from this process is thorough and clear, and it provides \nofficers with an in-depth understanding of the psychological and situational factors that can \nresult in bias influencing law enforcement outcomes, and the techniques that officers should use \n7 | P age \n \n\nto prevent this from happening.  We observed the training firsthand during our site visit and were \nextremely impressed not only with the curriculum, but also with the manner that the instructors \nat the SCPD academy delivered this material.  We commend the Department for the progress \nmade in this area.  Now that SCPD has begun delivering this training, we will continue to assess \nits delivery, as well as training schedules, to ensure that all SCPD officers are trained as required \nby the Agreement.  Based on our conversations with SCPD, we understand that this process will \ntake nearly two years to complete.   \n \nFinally, given the positive results that were achieved for the bias-free policing training by \nconsulting with community partners, we recommend that SCPD perform similar outreach \nregarding other training modules delivered by the academy.  This process not only promises to \nstrengthen existing training programs, but will help enhance relationships between SCPD and the \ncommunity it serves.    \n  \nB.  HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \n \nSubstantial \nIV. HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Training \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Tracking and Reporting \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Quality Assurance \nCompliance \n \nOur last compliance report noted that while SCPD had implemented several of the \nAgreement’s requirements regarding responding to hate crimes and hate incidents, the \nDepartment was not in substantial compliance with this area due to shortcomings with the \nimplementation of a hate crimes mapping system.  See Sixth Assessment Report at 9-11.  During \nthis last rating period, however, the Department launched a mapping system that will \nsubstantially improve SCPD’s ability to track and analyze these crimes and other incidents.  \nAccordingly, SCPD has reached substantial compliance with these portions of the Agreement.    \n \n1.  Training  \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD must ensure that all officers receive annual hate crimes and \nhate incident training.  See Agreement ¶ IV(a) at 7.  We found SCPD to be in substantial \ncompliance with this provision of the Agreement in October 2016.  See Fourth Assessment \nReport at 9-10.  The Department continues to deliver the approved training and it has not made \nany changes to the training material or curriculum since our assessment.  While we will continue \nto monitor whether SCPD is adequately training its members to identify and report hate crimes \nand hate incidents, the Department remains in substantial compliance with this requirement. \n8 | P age \n \n\n \n2.  Tracking, Reporting, and Pattern Analyses \n \nAs we noted in our last assessment report, a critical factor for SCPD to adequately and \neffectively combat hate crimes and hate incidents is its tracking and mapping of crime trends and \ncrime patterns, as required by the Agreement.  See Sixth Assessment Report at 9-10.  The \nDepartment has now fully implemented a mapping system for hate crimes and hate incidents that \ncomports with this requirement. \n \nDuring our last site visit, we observed the hate crimes mapping system firsthand.  This \nsystem reliably and clearly tracks hate crimes and other hate incidents in a manner that enables \ndetailed analysis that will ultimately lead to better law enforcement action.  The mapping system \nhas an integrated heat-mapping function that depicts concentrations of potential hate crimes and \nhate incidents.  The application also has a feature that allows users to click on the dots (each of \nwhich depicts a potential hate crime or hate incident) to bring up information about individual \nevents.  SCPD members can also isolate mapped incidents by bias-motivation, e.g., anti-Jewish \nor anti-Muslim.  The system also links the CC numbers (which are identifiers assigned to \nindividual events) to the narratives in the incident reports so that information about the incidents \nis integrated into the maps and members can easily access an incident’s full record. \n \nWe commend the Hate Crimes Unit (HCU) and other members of SCPD for the \ndevelopment and implementation of this system.  Over the next assessment periods, we will \ncontinue to assess SCPD’s use of the system to ensure it is properly maintained and used \neffectively to detect trends and identify perpetrators of hate crimes and hate incidents.  We also \nwill be conducting reviews to ensure that all HCU members are trained on the system and are \nequipped to use it and harness the information it contains. \n \nFinally, we commend the Department’s commitment to making the mapping data publicly \navailable in its annual report, and encourage the Department to initiate production of its first \nreport as soon as possible to bolster transparency regarding this important issue. \n3.  Quality Assurance \n \nThe Agreement requires SCPD to “implement a policy describing its HCU quality \nassurance process that ensures that HCU investigations follow proper techniques and \nprocedures,” and that SCPD will conduct random audits of HCU investigations and any \ncorrective actions taken because of the audits.  See Agreement ¶ IV(c) at 7-8.  We have \npreviously found SCPD to be in substantial compliance with the quality assurance requirements \nof the Agreement.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 9-10.   \nThe Department continued its quality assurance processes during this assessment period.  \nWe will continue to assess SCPD’s efforts in this area to ensure that substantial compliance is \nmaintained. \n \n \n9 | P age \n \n\nC.  LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE \n \nV. LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE   Partial Compliance  \n   a.  Policy   Substantial \nCompliance  \nSubstantial \n   b.  Language Line Order  \nCompliance  \n   c.

Community Survey   Partial Compliance  \n \n  The Agreement requires SCPD to develop and implement language access policies and \npractices so that persons who are Limited English Proficiency (LEP) have meaningful access to \npolice services.  See Agreement ¶ V at 8-11.  Effective communication with LEP individuals is \ncritical for effective policing.  LEP individuals are vulnerable to victimization and \nmarginalization.  Accordingly, as we have noted in previous reports, the Agreement requires that \nSCPD personnel be able to understand and respond to  LEP individuals, whether witnesses, \nsuspects or members of the public, especially during enforcement actions, criminal \ninvestigations, interrogations, and detentions.  \n  \n  We commend SCPD for its ongoing effort in this area and recognize the significant \nprogress it has made in the last six months.  It now has the necessary protocols and resources in \nplace to fully implement the Language Access Plan (LAP).  When the LAP is fully implemented, \nthe Department will be in Substantial Compliance in this area.  We hope that the Department will \nachieve Substantial Compliance in the next assessment period and we provide the following \nobservations and recommendations with the aim of supporting the Department in achieving that \ngoal.  \n \n1. Language Access Policy and Language Line Order   \n  \n  Our last report noted that SCPD has developed a strong LAP, and we commend it for \ncombining both rules and procedures into one document.  See SCPD LAP, Rules & Procedures, \nCh. 26, Sec. 5.  We made three recommendations in the last report, which SCPD has carefully \n10 | P age \n \n\nconsidered and addressed.  First, we recommended that SCPD expressly prohibit the use of \nchildren for language assistance, even in exigent circumstances, if other options are available.  \nSCPD has revised the rules and procedures issued to officers to reflect this prohibition.  Second, \nwe recommended that the SCPD create a hierarchy for the use of language assistance resources \nin common situations.  SCPD has rejected that recommendation, explaining that it wishes to \nprovide officers discretion in the field to determine the best means of ensuring efficiency and \neffectiveness of communication.  We accept SCPD’s determination, with the caveat that this \napproach means that SCPD will need to monitor such field decisions.  Finally, we recommended \nthat SCPD take statements from LEP individuals in the individual’s preferred or dominant \nlanguage rather than use an interpreter to translate the statement immediately into English.  \nSCPD has determined that it does not have the resources necessary to translate statements taken \nin another language into English, but will instead use interpreters to take statements in the \nspeaker’s native language and transcribe them immediately into English.  We accept this \nrationale, but note that this process may make it more difficult for LEP individuals to read and \naffirm the accuracy of their written statements.  We urge SCPD to continue seeking feedback \nabout whether and to what extent this approach will compromise the accuracy of statements from \nLEP individuals. \n  \n  We commend the SCPD Community Relations Bureau (CRB) for producing materials for \nthe public summarizing the LAP.  The Department has developed a five-point “Did You Know” \ncard for distribution to members of the public to inform them of their rights to language services \nand about how to file a complaint with the Internal Affairs Bureau.  CRB also has created an \nLAP flip guide for officers’ memo books. \n \n2.  Implementation of Language Access Plan (LAP)  \n  \n  Although implementation of the LAP is finally moving in a positive direction, it requires \nmore attention and improvement.  From our interviews and discussions with officers and \nsupervisors, there does not appear to full recognition of the importance of providing appropriate \nlanguage services.  Further, we continue to receive reports of LEP individuals failing to receive \nappropriate, courteous services, particularly at precinct front desks.  \n \n  First, Language Line use appears to have declined at the end of 2017.  This could be a \ntypical seasonal variation, but this still warrants further review.  There had been an upward trend \nin the usage of Language Line between 2014 and 2017 and we would have hoped and expected \nthis trend to continue.  The SCPD should monitor Language Line usage for the rest of 2018 and \nconsider if a continued decrease in the use of Language Line is a reason for concern.   \n \n  Second, Language Line billing data do not correspond with the data generated by \nofficers’ interpretation tracking forms.  For example, in February 2018, Language Line billed for \nHaitian Creole services 11 times.  No interpreter tracking forms reflect such services.  Similarly, \nbetween November 2017 and March 2018, there were 106 Chinese Language Line Services \ncalls.  During that same time, interpretation tracking forms reported only 16 instances of Chinese \nlanguage interpretation.  One possible explanation is that officers are using Language Line more \noften but not accurately reporting that usage.  Such discrepancies need to be reviewed and \nrectified. \n \n11 | P age \n \n\n  The SCPD just recently hired a data analyst to support data collection and analysis for all \nDOJ compliance efforts.  This is a positive development.  The analyst should be able to collect, \nreview, and analyze data regarding calls designated as “Lima”, i.e., designated by 911 operator \nas needing language access services.  In addition, supervisors must be trained and encouraged to \nconduct macro-level reviews of language access data, and regularly review the documentation of \nlanguage assistance, to flag problems, ensure that officers provide language access services when \nnecessary and to document the use of language services accurately.   \n \n  The Department is currently piloting the use of detachable tablets that are VoIP (Voice \nOver Internet Protocol) ready in patrol cars.  Officers will be able to call Language Line using \nthe tablet.  Department-wide distribution of tablets will eliminate the use of inadequate \ndepartment-issued flip phones or officers’ personal phones and will constitute a very positive \ndevelopment which will greatly facilitate the use of Language Line services and officers’ \nadherence to the LAP.  Once the transition is complete, we recommend that the Department \ninstitute a policy prohibiting the use of personal phones for Language Line calls. \n \n  Once again, we found different versions of the survey and LAP at the headquarters’ front \ndesk and other precinct locations.  In addition, at more than one precinct, we found two different \nversions of the community survey at the precinct’s front desk.  This lack of consistency is \nconfusing to the public and may compromise the survey results.  SCPD should resolve this issue.  \nThe entire LAP document does not need to be distributed at precinct offices; instead, the five-\npoint “Did You Know” card and LAP summary (in English and the other priority languages for \ntranslation) are more appropriate for public distribution.  Furthermore, because the survey \ninstrument itself is being revamped and the current version does not appear to be in use at \npresent (see the discussion below), the current version should be removed from the precinct front \ndesks. \n \n  Finally, we note that SCPD is still receiving a low volume of complaints and \ncompliments in languages other than English.  This has been an ongoing issue. The SCPD should \nwork more closely with community-based service providers to identify different ways of \nenabling and encouraging feedback from non-English speakers.  \n \n3.  Spanish Language Access to the SCPD Website  \n  \n  The SCPD has very recently updated its website but, as of the time of our visit, it had not \nyet posted translated forms and documents.   \n  \n4.  Incentives for Interpreters  \n  \n  Our previous report notes that the Department’s methods for incentivizing personnel to \nparticipate in its language assistance efforts appear to be effective and the number of officers \nwho are qualified as bilingual is growing.  We commend SCPD for this development and expect \nthat the corps of bilingual officers and interpreters will continue to grow.  SCPD should review \nand analyze its use of bilingual officers and interpreters in the same fashion as its usage of \nLanguage Line. \n \n5.  Consultation with the Latino Community & Community Survey   \n12 | P age \n \n\n \n  Over the course of the Agreement, we have seen improvement in the Department’s \ncontacts and relationship with Latino community leaders.    We understand, however, that some \ncommunity leaders are no longer active in the engagement process.  Identification and outreach \nto new community representatives can be challenging but is essential.  The Department also \nshould invite community members to participate or observe its initiatives, such as its training and \ncommunity survey development, so that there is a constant level of communication and \ncollaboration.  We understand that community members were invited to observe and encouraged \nto comment critically on recent trainings.  This was well received and we encourage the SCPD to \ncontinue such efforts. \n \n  The Agreement requires that SCPD survey community representatives regarding SCPD’s \nLEP efforts.  See Agreement ¶ V(h) at 10-11.  We understand that the Department is in \ndiscussion with some universities about producing and administering a community survey. We \nlook forward to hearing about future progress and encourage the Department to engage a wide \narray of community representatives in developing a dissemination strategy for the survey to \nensure confidence in the representativeness of the findings. \n \n6.  Language Assistance Training   \n  \n  We did not observe the language assistance training on this tour but understand that it \ncontinues to be updated as changes to the overall policy are instituted.  Further, we heard positive \nfeedback from students at Suffolk Community College who observed the training. We encourage \nthe Department to continue these types of efforts.   \n  \n  We understand that the Department is continuing to work on developing a curriculum for a \nSpanish language course for officers who are marginally fluent in Spanish.  We look forward to seeing the \nfinal curriculum and implementation of the course. \n \n \nD.  ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \n \nSubstantial \nVI. ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Reporting Misconduct \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Investigation of Misconduct \nCompliance \n \nUnder the police misconduct reporting requirements of the Agreement, SCPD must have \na policy that requires all members to report allegations of discriminatory policing, ensures that \nall complaints are investigated, and allows third-persons to submit complaints on behalf of \nvictims.  Agreement ¶ V(a) at 11.  The Agreement also includes various provisions concerning \nthe investigation of misconduct, which are aimed at ensuring that all complaints are thoroughly \n13 | P age \n \n\ninvestigated.  See Agreement ¶ V(b) at 11-12.  Through its sustained efforts over the last several \nreporting periods, the Department has reached substantial compliance with these provisions of \nthe Agreement. \n1.  Reporting Misconduct \n \nThe Department’s Civilian Complaint Procedure, Order 15-56, and its ongoing \nimplementation of that order, continues to satisfy the three requirements of the Reporting \nMisconduct section of the Agreement: (1) members’ duty to report allegations of discriminatory \npolicing, (2) ensuring that the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) investigates all complaints \nregardless of how the complainant submits the complaint, and (3) allowing third parties to file \ncomplaints on behalf of victims.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 16; Agreement VI(a) at 11.  In \naddition to complying with the provisions of this section, the Department has continued to \nundertake efforts not required by the Agreement to ensure robust reporting of misconduct.  \nSpecifically, SCPD has implemented an official policy that requires it to keep complainants \napprised of the status of their complaint.  See SCPD Directive, Order No. 17-01, Mar. 17, 2017.  \nWe have commended the Department in the past, and do so again, for instituting the policy.  See \nSixth Assessment Report at 16.  By increasing transparency around the investigative process, and \nmaintaining an adequate level of responsiveness toward complainants, the Department will \nimprove the public’s perception of the validity of the internal affairs process.  We will continue \nto monitor this section of the Agreement, including any related policies, to ensure that SCPD \nremains in substantial compliance. \n \n2.  Investigating Misconduct \n \nThe provisions of the Agreement that address the Department’s misconduct \ninvestigations are designed to ensure that SCPD’s misconduct complaints are timely and \nthoroughly investigated, that IAB has qualified SCPD members serving as investigators, and that \nthe Department tracks and analyzes IAB investigations to ensure their quality and identify issues.  \nSee Agreement VI(b) at 11-12.  The Department has taken several meaningful steps that have \nbrought it into substantial compliance with these requirements. \nThe Department has improved its recruitment of investigators, and the position has now \nbecome viewed as a stepping-stone for advancement within the Department.  See Agreement \nVI(b)(ii) at 11.  Indeed, in the last year alone, SCPD promoted approximately a half-dozen of its \nIAB investigators to other positions within the Department.  The Department has also invested in \nthe professional development of its investigators by sending them to trainings, such as a forensic \nscience training and an internal investigations course.  By investing in IAB in this manner, the \nDepartment will continue to attract qualified candidates to IAB and ensure a higher quality of \ninvestigations.   \nSCPD has instituted processes and methods to ensure that complaints do not lag \nindefinitely without a final disposition.  Complaints are assigned a unique identifier, and the \nDepartment timely refers complaints to IAB.  We will continue monitoring this provision to \nensure that these referrals continue in a manner that is consistent with the Agreement’s \nrequirements regarding timeliness.  See Agreement VI(b)(i) at 11.  IAB uses a computer \nprogram, called “Blue Team”, to receive automatic notifications when a case has reached 120 \ndays, allowing supervisors to intervene if needed.  IAB notifies complainants by letter after 180 \n14 | P age \n \n\ndays if the investigation is ongoing.  The Department also tracks its biased policing \ninvestigations, analyzes trends, and publishes its conclusions in an annual report.   \nIAB has continued to work on clearing its backlog of unresolved cases and to investigate \nnew cases in a timely manner.  Our review of biased-policing investigations that the Department \ncompleted during this assessment period showed that, while work on the backlog remains, newly \nfiled complaints are being resolved in an expeditious manner.  Of the complaints filed between \nNovember 2017 and March 2018, the average investigation duration was 91 days – a marked \nimprovement over the length of time it has taken to complete investigations in the past.  See \nSixth Assessment Report at 17 (noting complaints from 2015 had taken an average of two years \nto complete; those from 2016 took an average of 11 months to complete). \nIn our last assessment report, we noted that the length of investigations was the primary \nimpediment to SCPD achieving substantial compliance in this area.  Given the positive \nimprovements made during this rating period, we have determined that SCPD has achieved \nsubstantial compliance in this area.  We will continue to monitor all aspects of this section of the \nAgreement to ensure that investigations continue to be conducted in a timely and effective \nmanner that helps ensure accountability within the Department.   \n \nE.

Social Media and Notification Systems \nCompliance \n \n SCPD has developed a robust approach to community engagement since entry of the \nSettlement Agreement in 2014.  It has created new positions in headquarters and in each \nprecinct to encourage and coordinate interaction and communication between the \nDepartment and the community.  It holds regular meetings at the precinct level and \ncountywide and is beginning to incorporate patrol officers into its engagement efforts.  Over \nthis past reporting period, SCPD, in particular its Community Liaison Officers (CLO), \nCommunity Oriented Policing Enforcement (COPE) officers, and the command staff in its \nCommunity Response Bureau (CRB) continued to devote substantial time and energy \n15 | P age \n \n\ntoward community engagement.  We remain impressed with the work of CRB, in particular \nSergeant Kathleen Kenneally.  New Commissioner Geraldine Hart has already \ndemonstrated her commitment to building on her predecessor’s outreach work and further \nimprove relations.  \n \nSCPD continues to be in partial compliance with this section overall but is very close to \nsubstantial compliance.  In order to achieve substantial compliance on the remaining two \nprovisions – which requires SCPD to “maintain robust community relationships and engage \nconstructively with the community to ensure collaborative problem-solving, ethical and bias-\nfree policing, and community confidence in the Department” – it should reach out to the \ncommunity in new and different ways.  While SCPD leadership has taken several \ncommendable initiatives that we have noted in this and other reports, these initiatives may not \nhave sufficiently filtered down to precinct officers.  Our conversations with community \nmembers continue to reveal a persistent mistrust of SCPD.  As we noted in our last report, more \nstill needs to be done to ensure that all officers understand that improving community relations \nis an integral part of their daily duties, and not limited to participation in organized events.  \nAdditionally, SCPD needs to be more proactive, analytical, and strategic to engage with less \ntraditional partners and the more underserved parts of the Suffolk County community and it \nshould enhance its efforts to address current questions and concerns of the community through \noutreach and distribution of informational materials. \n \n1.  Maintaining Community Relationships and Community Outreach \n \nSCPD has maintained the partial compliance ratings that it had achieved in these areas in \npast reporting periods.  We continue to be impressed with the array of activities that the CLO and \nCOPE officers plan and execute.  The Department and its individual precincts continue to \nmaintain a busy schedule of community outreach events, including quarterly meetings with the \nLatino Community Outreach Committee, monthly community meetings at the precincts, and \npopular programs such as sports programs for local youth and trainings targeted at educating \nabout the risks of opioid addiction.  Patrol officers appear to be attending community outreach \nevents organized by the CLO and COPE officers in their precincts more often, including \nattending their precinct’s monthly community meetings.  In addition, SCPD is continuing to \nmeet its obligation of producing and publishing annual reports with its own analysis of CRB’s \nsuccesses, areas in need of improvement, and strategies for making improvements, including \nposting these reports on its own website. \n \nFormer Commissioner Sini’s quarterly meetings with Latino advocates were a significant \nimprovement.  However, community advocates have told us that they continue to find the \nmeetings unsatisfying.  Advocates still feel that many of their questions go unanswered and that \nSCPD officials do not address their concerns.  Although SCPD has somewhat restructured these \nmeetings, we suggest that it continue to look for ways to include additional participation and \nbetter communication by, among other things, holding the meetings at different times of day and \nlocations.  Commissioner Hart and the Community Response Bureau have begun the \nimplementation of this recommendation and seen increased community attendance. \n \nAs we stated in our last report, to achieve substantial compliance in this area, SCPD \n16 | P age \n \n\nneeds to develop an effective computer system for tracking and analysis of community \noutreach events.  We recognize that SCPD has been trying to develop such a system for quite a \nwhile and that the project is underway.  Until it is completed and fully implemented, SCPD \ncannot demonstrate that its officers are regularly conducting and accurately recording their \ncommunity outreach work, or that community contacts and supervisors at all levels possess \nsufficient information to measure and analyze the effectiveness of community outreach.  This \nin turn impacts SCPD’s ability to appropriately share information across precincts, to identify \npotential gaps in community outreach, and to strategize about how to improve the effectiveness \nand breadth of community outreach.  Relatedly, although SCPD has built the database it will \nuse to maintain and share community contacts within SCPD, it still needs to finalize and \ndisseminate a training bulletin explaining how to use the database.  We are unclear what \nbarriers exist to completing this project.  As noted in the discussion of Language Access above, \nSCPD has recently retained a data analyst, and we hope that his work will include analysis and \nfurther development of these computer systems, and that we will see them in place on our next \ntour. \n \nWe also note that the Agreement requires SCPD to “engage the public through the \ndissemination of public information on a regular basis.”  Agreement ¶ VII(a) at 12-13.  The \npublic information to be disseminated could include information about SCPD policies and \nprocedures that relate to functions of SCPD other than CRB—for example, the policies and \nprocesses relating to how members of the public may submit complaints about officer \nmisconduct.  This requires collaboration between CRB and the various departments; there \ncontinues to be uncertainty as to who has the responsibility for generation of the materials.  We \nrecommend that CRB take on the coordination of this project.  We also recommend that SCPD \nassign responsibility within the Department for identifying informational materials that would \nbe useful to the public, other than just community outreach materials, for facilitating the \ncreation of those materials in coordination with the relevant SCPD component, and for \ndetermining how SCPD will disseminate these materials to the public.  In light of the \nsignificant impact this will have on community engagement, CRB may be the most appropriate \ncomponent for this responsibility. \n \n2.  Community Liaison Officers, Community Oriented Policing Enforcement, and the  \n  Community Response Bureau \n \nAs we noted above, SCPD has maintained a rating of substantial compliance with the \nprovisions of the Agreement relating to the responsibilities of the CLO and COPE officers.  \nWe continue to be impressed with the dedication and expertise of the individual officers in \nthese roles.  They not only help restore trust between SCPD and the communities it serves, but \nalso better enable SCPD to prevent and fight crime by broadening its partnerships and \nexpanding the range of individuals coordinating to protect public safety. \n \nWe encourage SCPD to think creatively and strategically about how to achieve these \ngoals even more broadly.  For SCPD to “maintain robust community relationships and engage \nconstructively with the community to ensure collaborative problem-solving, ethical and bias-\nfree policing, and community confidence in the Department” in “all of its policing \noperations[,]” see Agreement at ¶ VII(a), all officers and command staff will need to be \ninvolved, and not only the CLO and COPE officers assigned to conduct community outreach.  \n17 | P age \n \n\nThis also may involve strategies and actions outside of the traditional community outreach \nevents organized by the CLO and COPE officers.  For example, the Department’s community \npolicing could include building relationships between the Department and other local \ngovernmental agencies, service providers, and community advocacy organizations.    \n \nFinally, to achieve substantial compliance with the provisions of the Agreement relating \nto community outreach, and to maximize the impact of SCPD’s community engagement \nefforts, SCPD needs to develop and implement a community survey, as required by the \nAgreement.  This project has been underway for a substantial time and needs to be completed \nas soon as possible. \n \nCommissioner Hart recognizes that building strong community partnerships throughout \nthe entire Suffolk County community is critical to the Department’s ability to effectively fight \ncrime.  We commend SCPD for its efforts to date on building those partnerships, and stand \nready to provide SCPD with technical assistance, including guidance from our subject matter \nexperts, examples from other law enforcement agencies, and written resources, which may be \nuseful to SCPD as it builds upon the significant progress already achieved.  In this area, SCPD \nhas made tremendous changes and the responses from some members of the community are \nquite positive.   \n \nF.    POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY \n \nSubstantial \nVII. POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY \nCompliance  \n \nSCPD must “maintain policies and procedures that are consistent with [the] Agreement \nand that provide clear direction to ensure that officers and civilian employees enforce the law \neffectively, ethically, and constitutionally.”  Agreement ¶ VIII(a) at 17.  The Agreement also \nrequires that SCPD ensures that “all officers who take [required] trainings will be required to \npass a test demonstrating a basic comprehension of the training material after it is presented.”  Id. \n¶ VIII(b).  The Department has met these requirements.  \n \n  \n \n18 | P age \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n \nIn January 2014, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Suffolk \nCounty Police Department (“SCPD” or the “Department”) entered into a Settlement Agreement \n(“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement”) to ensure that police services are provided to all \nmembers of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, in a manner that \ncomplies with the Constitution and laws of the United States.1  DOJ, as part of its responsibilities \nfor oversight of SCPD’s implementation of the Settlement Agreement, periodically reports on its \nassessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  This is the sixth Assessment Report, \nwhich reports on progress made during the last six months of 2017.   \n \nSince we issued our last assessment report in June 2017 (the “Fifth Assessment Report”), \nDOJ representatives from both the Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney’s Office \nfor the Eastern District of New York reviewed documents and materials provided by SCPD, \nincluding revised policies and procedures, copies of internal affairs investigations, a sample of \nentries in SCPD’s community relations daily activity reporting system, and other reports.  We \nalso met with SCPD officials, SCPD command staff and other supervisors, and SCPD officers; \ntoured precincts and participated in ride-alongs with on-duty officers; attended training courses; \nand met with members of specialized units, including the Hate Crimes Unit (“HCU”), the \nInternal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”), and the Community Response Bureau (“CRB”).  In addition, \nwe solicited the views of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, by \nmeeting with community advocates.  In conducting these activities, we consulted with police \npractice experts with expertise in the areas of policing covered by the Settlement Agreement.     \n    \nWe thank the SCPD officials with whom we met during this assessment period, and we \nappreciate the cooperation and effort that SCPD and Suffolk County leadership continue to show \nin addressing the requirements of the Agreement.  We also thank the many members of the \nSuffolk County community who have met with us and provided us with invaluable feedback.  \n \nIn particular, we would like to thank Commissioner Timothy Sini for his leadership and \ncommitment to the reform process set forth in the Agreement.  Commissioner Sini’s personal \nefforts have been a significant cause of SCPD’s progress during his tenure with the Department.  \nAs he has consistently noted, the steps he has taken to bring SCPD into compliance with the \nAgreement not only help ensure constitutional policing, but also lay the groundwork to bolster \nSCPD’s community partnerships and enhance its ability to fight crime.  We look forward to \nworking closely with the next SCPD commissioner to continue this important effort.     \n  \nThis Assessment Report is divided into two sections.  First, we provide a compliance \nrating for each provision of the Settlement Agreement.  Second, we provide a more detailed \nanalysis of SCPD’s successes and challenges to date in each main area of the Agreement:  1) \nbias-free policing; 2) hate crimes and hate incidents; 3) language assistance; 4) allegations of \npolice misconduct; and 5) community engagement.     \n \n                                                           \n1  This Agreement is available in both English and Spanish at https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section-\ncases-and-matters0#police.  \n2 | P age \n \n\nBefore turning to our assessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, we note \nthat under the Agreement, SCPD is to provide DOJ with a self-assessment compliance report \nindicating its own views as to whether the county has reached compliance with the Agreement.  \nAgreement ¶ IX(c)(ii) at 20.  The Department did not provide us with a self-assessment report \nfor this assessment period.  We would like to impress upon the Department the importance of \nconducting self-assessments of its progress with the Agreement.  First, SCPD’s self-assessments \nprovide us with the necessary information to conduct fully informed assessments.  Second, the \nDepartment benefits from auditing its own progress with the Agreement and identifying areas of \nconcern.    \n \nII.   CURRENT COMPLIANCE RATINGS \n \nSection IX of the Settlement Agreement provides that the United States will assess and \nreport on SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  See Agreement ¶ IX at 19-20.  The \ncompliance ratings below represent the United States’ current assessment of SCPD’s compliance \nwith each area of the Agreement.  While Section III of this Report provides a more detailed \nanalysis of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, these ratings are included to provide SCPD \nand the Suffolk County community with a clear and accurate summary of progress to date, as \nwell as areas that remain most in need of attention.   \n \nThe definition of each rating type is as follows: \n \n•  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  \n•  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.    \n•  “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement. \n•  “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation. \n \n \nStatus of \nSettlement Agreement Area \nCompliance  \nIII.

Training \nPending \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD has committed to ensuring that its police services are \n“equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that promotes broad community \nengagement and confidence in the Department” and that all “members of the public receive equal \nprotection of the law, without bias based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or \nsexual orientation, and in accordance with the rights, privileges, and immunities secured or \nprotected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.”  Agreement ¶ III(a) at 4.  To bring \nthese provisions to fruition, the Department must develop and implement a robust system of \ntraining, supervision, data collection, and accountability mechanisms that ensure its law \nenforcement duties are being performed free of impermissible bias.  As we noted in our last \nAssessment Report, SCPD has codified the principles of bias-free policing through its policies \nand procedures but the principles of bias-free policing must take root through the Department’s \ndata collection and analyses and its training program.  Fifth Assessment Report at 6-7.  The \nDepartment has not made significant progress in the area of traffic-stop data collection over the \nlast six-month period, and it continues to work toward providing adequate bias-free policing \ntraining to its members.  Thus, the Department’s compliance ratings for the bias-free \nrequirements of the Agreement since the last assessment period remain unchanged.   \n \n5 | P age \n \n\n1.  Continued Delivery of Bias-Free Policing \n \nAs detailed below, SCPD has a significant amount of work to complete to achieve \nsubstantial compliance with the traffic-stop data collection and bias-free policing training \nprovisions of the Agreement.  By collecting the necessary data, and periodically analyzing that \ndata, the Department will be able to ensure that it is conducting traffic stops in a race-neutral and \nnon-discriminatory manner.  A robust bias-free training for all officers and recruits is also \nnecessary to train them to better identify implicit biases and to incorporate the principles of \nprocedural justice in interactions with the diverse communities they serve.  Accordingly, these \nrequirements are fundamental to the continued delivery of bias-free policing and to achieving \nsubstantial compliance in this area. \n \n2.  Policies and Procedures  \n \nWe previously rated SCPD in substantial compliance with the policies and procedures \nprovisions of the Agreement.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 5-6; Fourth Assessment Report at \n6; see also, ¶¶ Agreement III(a) - (b) at 4-5.  As we have noted before, ensuring that SCPD \nmembers adhere to these policies in practice will require additional work, specifically, through \nappropriate data collection and analyses, which continues to be a work in progress for the \nDepartment, as discussed below.  \n  \n3.  Traffic-Stop Data \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD must collect accurate traffic-stop data and analyze it for \nindications of bias in order to ensure bias-free policing.  See Agreement ¶ III(c) at 6.  Our past \nassessment reports have detailed the various shortcomings with SCPD’s data collection practices.  \nSee Third Assessment Report at 7-8; Fourth Assessment Report at 6-7; Fifth Assessment Report \nat 6-7.  While SCPD has taken steps towards developing appropriate data collection and analysis \nsystems, SCPD had yet to successfully implement such a system at the end of this assessment \nperiod in December 2017.  \n \nThe Department planned to transition from a computerized data terminal system designed \nby an outside vendor to one developed and maintained by SCPD’s information technology \ndepartment, which would give SCPD greater control over the data collection and improve the \nDepartment’s ability to analyze up-to-date data.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 6.  The \nDepartment’s IT Unit began designing the data collection module last winter, and worked with \nthe DOJ to ensure that all necessary data fields were included.  See id. \n \nAfter months of preparation, the Department launched the system on August 28, 2017.  \nSCPD told us that within the first few hours of launching the system, officers reported taking \nbetween 5 to 10 minutes to complete a stop report.  The Department had expected an increase in \ncompletion time from 30-45 seconds to two minutes, and attributes part of the problem to the \nfact that officers must obtain a central compliant number (CC#) from one system (MDC) before \nthey can complete the stop report in another system (ORS).  Additionally, SCPD reported that \nofficers found the design of the new system difficult to navigate because the fields were not \nlinear or easy to scroll through.  SCPD discontinued using the system the very day it launched it \ndue to these issues. To correct these issues, the Department plans to build and entirely separate \n6 | P age \n \n\ndatabase for the stop reports.  The Department is also redesigning the fields so that they are easy \nto scroll through and include gateway questions (e.g., an answer of “no” to the question of \nwhether there was a search would drop all the attendant questions).   \n \nSCPD had committed to launching the redesigned system by early 2018, and did begin \ntesting it with Highway Patrol in January of this year.  To avoid real-time difficulties during the \nanticipated launch of the system, we recommended that SCPD issue a new directive before it \nlaunches the system Department-wide and provide roll call training on its operation.  We also \nrecommend that SCPD first test the system and consult with officers to identify and correct \nissues before introducing it Department-wide.  This should help mitigate the learning curve and \nincrease in completion time experienced with the most recent system launch attempt.  \n \nWe again renew our recommendation that the Department link the traffic-stop reports to \nuse-of-force reports where a traffic stop led to a force incident so that supervisors and command \nstaff will be able to conduct thorough analyses of traffic stop and use of force incidents, and to \ndetermine whether any force incidents unnecessarily resulted from an illegal stop.  See Fifth \nAssessment Report at 6.  We also renew our recommendation that SCPD supervisors develop \nspecific protocols for the substantive review of traffic-stop data as part of supervisors’ regular \nsupervisory activities and that SCPD provide updated training for supervisors, many of whom \nhave not received supervisor-specific training since attaining the rank of sergeant.  See Fourth \nAssessment Report at 7; Fifth Assessment Report at 6-7.  This is instrumental to insuring that the \ndata collected can be harnessed and put to use by supervisors.   \n \nDuring our last assessment tour, we had recommended that the Department collect basic \ndemographic data for its checkpoint stops (e.g., DWI, safety checkpoints).  The DOJ provided \nthe Department a sample form for collecting such data that would not impede its checkpoint \noperations, and after recent discussions, the Department adopted the checklist and was reportedly \namending its policy on checkpoints in February 2018. \n \nWhile we are hopeful that SCPD will take the necessary steps to achieve substantial \ncompliance with the traffic stop provisions of the Agreement, it remains in partial compliance for \nthe current assessment period due to the continued failure to implement an adequate data \ncollections system.  See Agreement ¶ III(c) at 6. \n \n4.  Training \n \nThe Agreement requires that all sworn officers receive training on bias-free policing at \nleast annually.  See Agreement ¶ III(d) at 6-7.  This training is to “emphasize that discriminatory \npolicing, in the form of either selective enforcement or non-enforcement of the law, including the \nselecting or rejecting of particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited by policy and will \nsubject officers to disciplinary action.”  Id.  The Agreement also sets forth specific elements that \nSCPD must incorporate into its bias-free training.  Id. \n \nAs detailed in our previous reports, SCPD suspended its bias-free policing training after \nwe determined that it was deficient.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 8; Fifth Assessment \nReport at 7.  We had coordinated with the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States \nDepartment of Justice for it to provide SCPD with technical assistance in the form of training \n7 | P age \n \n\nmodules; specifically, training programs on both procedural justice and bias-free policing.  See \nFourth Assessment Report at 8; Fifth Assessment Report at 7.  Details of the planned training are \navailable in our last assessment report.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 7.  SCPD had agreed to \nwork with OJP on the training in an effort to satisfy the bias-free policing training requirements \nof the Agreement.  See Agreement ¶ III(d) at 6-7.  In June 2017, OJP informed SCPD that it had \nceased providing procedural justice and bias-free training.  Thereafter, we worked to facilitate \ndiscussions with a major-city police department that had obtained the procedural justice and \nbias-free training in the past.  During this rating period, that department met with SCPD to \nprovide guidance about the trainings, and emphasized the importance of identifying the \nappropriate trainers to deliver what can be highly sensitive trainings to SCPD members.  It also \nshared training materials that SCPD was able to customize for its own use.   \n \nAs of our last visit, SCPD was developing the curriculum for a procedural justice 3 – bias \nfree policing training module – which it launched in early 2018.  While we commend the \nDepartment for moving forward with these plans, we encourage SCPD to provide the procedural \njustice 1 and 2 modules to its members, as the first two modules provide the foundation for \nprocedural justice 3.  Our concern lies in the possibility that the procedural justice 3 module \nalone, without the introductory modules, will prove less effective in instilling the principles of \nprocedural justice and bias-free policing among Department members.  Additionally, upon the \nrecommendation of the major-city police department that advised SCPD on the procedural \njustice training, the Department had indicated it would send its trainers to a train-the-trainer \ntraining provided by another law enforcement agency.  Despite plans to do so in September \n2017, the Department ultimately declined to do so.  We would encourage it to reconsider sending \ntrainers to observe the trainings in order to better prepare themselves to deliver the training, \nwhich entails presenting difficult subject matter.   \n \nAs we have noted before, once SCPD trainers begin to deliver the training, we will assess \nwhether SCPD is appropriately tailoring and delivering the training modules in a manner that is \nconsistent with the terms of the Agreement.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 7.  To do so, we will \nreview training curricula, observe training sessions, and meet with SCPD trainers and officers \ncompleting the training to assess effectiveness.  Based on SCPD’s proposed timeline for \ndelivering the training, we expect to be able to provide an assessment rating by the time of our \nnext assessment period.  For this assessment period, the compliance rating is pending due to the \nneed to find an alternative way for the Department to provide procedural justice training. \n \nB.  HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \n \nIV. HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Training \nCompliance \n   b.  Tracking and Reporting  Partial Compliance \n8 | P age \n \n\nSubstantial \n   c.  Quality Assurance \nCompliance \n \nAs noted in our last compliance report, SCPD was in partial compliance with the tracking \nand reporting requirement of the Agreement.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 8-9.  While the \nDepartment had made significant strides in the areas of training and quality assurance for this \npart of the Agreement, it has not been able to implement a new mapping system to track and \nanalyze potential hate crimes and hate incidents, and thus remains in partial compliance with the \ntracking and reporting requirement of the Agreement. \n \n1.  Training  \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD must ensure that all officers receive annual hate crimes and \nhate incident training.  Agreement ¶ IV(a) at 7.  After several attempts of redesigning its hate \ncrimes and hate incidents training, we found SCPD to be in substantial compliance with this \nprovision of Agreement in October of 2016.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 9-10.  The \nDepartment continues to deliver the approved training, and it has not made any changes to the \ntraining material or curriculum since our assessment.  While we will continue to monitor whether \nSCPD is adequately training its members to identify and report hate crimes and hate incidents, \nthe Department remains in substantial compliance with this requirement. \n \n2.  Tracking, Reporting, and Pattern Analyses \n \nAs we noted in our last assessment report, a critical factor for SCPD to adequately and \neffectively combat hate crimes and hate incidents is its tracking and mapping of crime trends and \ncrime patterns, as required by the Agreement.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 8.  Notably, we \ncautioned that the Department could not ensure that it was tracking and analyzing crimes to \nidentify patterns or trends of potential hate crimes or hate incidents until it developed and \nimplemented a mapping system that would allow officers to engage in pattern analysis.  See id.  \nWhile the Department appears to have promising plans to develop and implement such as \nsystem, it has not brought those plans to operation and thus remains in partial compliance with \nthis requirement of the Agreement.  Agreement ¶ IV(b) at 7.   \n   \nIn September 2017, we met with the Hate Crimes Unit (HCU) to discuss compliance with \nthe hate crimes and hate incident provisions of the Agreement.  At that time, the HCU estimated \nthat it would take three to six months before it would have the mapping system ready.  When we \nvisited again in October 2017, we met with the programmer and coordinator who are overseeing \nthe development of the new mapping system.  While the Department had a several month delay \nin working on the mapping system, it had made recent efforts to continue to develop the maps.  \nFor example, SCPD has integrated a heat map that depicts concentrations of potential hate \ncrimes and hate incidents into the map application.  The application also has a feature that allows \nusers to click on the dots (each of which depicts a potential hate crime or hate incident) to bring \nup information about the individual events.  SCPD members will also be able to isolate mapped \nincidents by bias-motivation, e.g., anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim.  The Department also reported \nthat the system would link the CC numbers (which are identifiers assigned to individual events) \nto the narratives in the incident reports so that information about the incident is integrated into \n9 | P age \n \n\nthe maps members can easily access the relevant information for a potential hate crime or hate \nincident. \n \nAt the time of our October visit, SCPD was working on the data standardization for the \nsystem.  The HCU will be responsible for inputting the data; HCU will use an application to do \nthis, which should increase the data integrity.  The Department reported that it plans to have a \nhate crimes investigator train other HCU members how to use the system.  We recommend that \nIT train the other members of the HCU who will be inputting the data to ensure that they receive \nadequate training.  Additionally, we recommended in our meeting, and do again now, that SCPD \nwrite a SOP (standard operating procedure) concurrently as it develops the mapping system and \nits various functions.  This will alleviate the need to go back and recreate the steps to write the \nSOP later. \n \nThe Department will make the mapping data publicly available in its annual report.  We \nencourage the Department to consider additional ways in which it may be able to share publicly \nits maps and mapping data once the system is operational.  For example, we renew our \nrecommendation that the Department produce the annual report mapping and analyzing potential \npatterns and trends for all hate crimes and hate incidents on a bi-annual basis to maximize the \nutility of the crime data in identifying hate crime patterns.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 10; \nFifth Assessment Report at 9. \n3.  Quality Assurance \n \nThe Agreement requires SCPD to “implement a policy describing its HCU quality \nassurance process that ensures that HCU investigations follow proper techniques and \nprocedures,” and that SCPD will conduct random audits of HCU investigations and any \ncorrective actions taken because of the audits.  Agreement ¶ IV(c) at 7-8.  During the last \nassessment period, we found SCPD to be in substantial compliance with the quality assurance \nrequirements of the Agreement.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 9-10.  We commended the \nHCU’s community outreach efforts, noting that they are critical to encouraging members from \nSuffolk’s diverse communities to report potential hate crimes or hate incidents to the police.  Id. \nat 10.  The Department has continued to take steps to reach these communities by welcoming \ninquiries and offering to have meetings with representatives or members from the communities.  \nThe Department conducted a bi-annual hate crime audit during this assessment period as \nrequired by the Agreement.  See Agreement ¶ IV(c)(ii) at 6-7.  Our review of the randomly \nselected sample set of cases found that investigators conducted thorough investigations.  Indeed, \nin one sample case, the investigator was able to locate video evidence that turned out to \ncontradict the complainant’s testimony and re-interviewed the complaint, who then admitted that \nthe initial statement was incorrect.  Consequently, the Department correctly reclassified the \nincident as a non-criminal event.  Further, the audit summaries were sufficiently comprehensive \nto assess the quality of the investigations.  The audit included one case that did not mention the \nfollow-up, if any, by the investigator with the complainant after the Department determined it did \nnot have sufficient evidence to continue the investigation and classified it as pending.  We would \nrecommend including this information in the audit when possible.   \nThe Department did not issue a Hate Crimes Report for this assessment period, as the \nreport is only required on an annual basis under the Agreement.  However, we encourage the \n10 | P age \n \n\nDepartment to consider issuing the report on a bi-annual basis to facilitate addressing potential \npatterns of hate crimes in a more timely fashion.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 10. \nOverall, the Department has maintained substantial compliance with the quality assurance \nrequirements of the Agreement, and we commend its continued work in this area.  We look \nforward to working with the SCPD and its HCU on its tracking and reporting of hate crimes or \nhate incidents so that it can obtain substantial compliance with that provision, and thus with the \nhate crimes and hate incidents section of the Agreement. \nC.

Incentives for Interpreters \nCompliance \n   f.  Consultation with the Latino Community  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   g.  Language Assistance Training \nCompliance \n   h.  Community Survey  Partial Compliance \n \nThe terms of the Agreement call for SCPD to develop and implement meaningful \nlanguage access policies and practices.  See Agreement ¶ V at 8-11.  Appropriate communication \nwith individuals who have Limited English Proficiency (LEP) is an essential part of effective \npolicing.  As we have noted before, SCPD personnel must be able to understand and respond to \nLEP individuals during the course of any interaction, most importantly during enforcement \nactions, criminal investigations, interrogations, and detentions.  See Fifth Assessment Report at \n11.  This is especially true because LEP individuals are particularly vulnerable to victimization \nand marginalization.  \n \nAlthough in past assessment periods, the Department significantly improved its policies, \npractices, and training, implementation is still mixed and SCPD did not make significant \nprogress during the last six months.  As discussed below, we remain concerned that SCPD \ncontinues to fall short of fully implementing the Language Access Plan (LAP) and does not \nsufficiently track or monitor provision of language access services. \n \n11 | P age \n \n\n1.  Language Access Policy and Language Line Order  \n \nOverall, SCPD has a strong LAP rules and procedures manual, and we commend it for \ncombining the rules and procedures into one document.  See SCPD LAP, Rules & Procedures, \nCh. 26, Sec. 5.  Most recently, the Department’s revision of the permitted role and \nresponsibilities of certified bilingual staff was a positive change as it clarified the assignment of \nduties in a more coherent manner. \n \nWe reiterate our recommendation from our last report for three changes that SCPD \nshould incorporate into its LAP.  Once it adopts these recommendations, the SCPD will likely be \nin substantial compliance with the language assistance policy provision of the Agreement.  \nAgreement ¶ V(a) at 8-9.  First, SCPD should expressly prohibit use of children for language \nassistance, even in exigent circumstances, if other options are available.  Second, the LAP should \nprioritize the preferred order for using the available language assistance resources in common \nsituations.  For example, the Department should provide guidance as to what an officer should do \nwhen responding to a call for service in which a witness does not speak English and a \ndepartment authorized interpreter (DAI), bilingual officer, and Language Line are all available.  \nThird, SCPD needs to clarify the process for taking statements from LEP individuals.  We \nrecommend taking statements in a person’s best language and then translating them using a \ncertified translator.  \n \nFinally, the Department’s development of a flow chart that details the process of \naccessing language assistance is an effective tool for summarizing the key points of the LAP.  It \nwill be particularly useful to officers who are in the field as a memo book insert.  Likewise, the \nrevised “5 Point Card” provides a good summary of the LAP for community members.  We look \nforward to seeing the card translated and widely distributed within LEP communities in Suffolk.  \n \nThe Department continues to be in substantial compliance with the provision of the \nAgreement regarding its language line.  Agreement ¶ V(b) at 9. \n \n2.  Policy on Persons with LEP  \n \nSCPD’s language assistance policies and training are generally positive, but the \nimplementation of the LAP does not seem to have improved.  The exceptions are the 911 Call \nCenter and Language Line.  As we have noted before, the Call Center is adequately providing \nlanguage access services.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 12.  We also note that the use of \nLanguage Line continues to increase consistently, and is on pace to receive nearly double the \nnumber of calls in 2017 compared to 2014.  \n \nHowever, community members have described negative results of phone calls to \nprecincts testing SCPD front desk personnel’s ability to effectively communicate with callers \nwho do not speak English.  Although some callers received appropriate services, community \nmembers reported that at least one SCPD member insulted a Spanish-speaking caller and then \nhung up.  Although we did not observe this type of behavior during our visits to precincts, \nprecinct front desk personnel appeared frequently unaware of the language access resources \navailable (e.g., the language identification chart).  \n \n12 | P age \n \n\nWe also continue to hear from officers that they frequently use their own phones to \naccess Language Line rather than the Department-issued flip phones because of the poor quality \nof the Department phones.  Despite the significant increase in the use of Language Line, this \nstrongly disincentivizes officers to use the service.  Further, as we noted in our last assessment, \ncommunity members have complained that it is difficult to understand telephonic interpreters \nwhen officers use Department-issued phones.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 12.  We \nrecommend that SCPD update its phones to ensure effective communication with interpreters \nwhen using Language Line.  Id. \n \nWe also recommended after our April 2017 visit that SCPD revise its Online Reporting \nSystem to require officers to indicate in a designated computer field what, if any, language \nassistance services they provided, even for non-Lima calls.2  Id. at 13.  At present, only calls \ndesignated Lima by dispatch require officers to fill the language assistance field, which collects \ndata on the language assistance services provided.  The system continues to automatically \ncomplete the field in non-Lima designated calls with “no language assistance required.”  We \nreiterate our call for SCPD to eliminate this default.  A need for language assistance can surface \nat the scene after the initial call, and it is important that officers have to fill in the field rather \nthan rely upon a default entry.  \n \nSCPD’s data regarding language access services are inadequate for a meaningful \nanalysis.  We understand that the Department has hired an analyst to assist with this important \nresponsibility.  The analyst should be able to collect, review, and analyze data regarding Lima \ncalls so that supervisors can conduct a macro-level review of the language access services \nprovided.  Further, precinct supervisors should be instructed how to review the documentation of \nlanguage assistance, to flag problems and ensure that officers provide language access services \nwhen necessary and to accurately document the use of language services.  \n \nWe understand that the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) continues to do its own review of \nlanguage access calls.  As noted before, we believe this review would be better focused and more \neffective if prompted by a full data analysis that flags potentially problematic officers, through \nan early warning system model.  See id. \n \nThe limited data on interpretation we did receive for the most recent assessment period \nshows that only 20% of Lima calls receive language assistance.  This is the same frequency as \nthe last assessment and, as the Department has acknowledged, probably inaccurate.  It is highly \nunlikely that only 20% of designated Lima calls required language access.  The 4th and 7th \nprecincts, which have the fewest Lima calls, also had the lowest rates of providing language \nassistance.  In the 4th precinct, only 10%of calls received language assistance, and in 7th \nprecinct, only 15% received language assistance.  Officers either are not using language access \nservices when required, or at a minimum, are not adequately documenting the use of the services.  \nLimited IAB audits confirm that officers are not providing the mandated services.  This must be \naddressed so that the Department has accurate data on the volume and frequency of use of its \nlanguage services. \n \n                                                           \n2 Any call that a 911 dispatcher receives for which language assistance is indicated is assigned a “Lima” code. \n13 | P age \n \n\nSCPD has begun tracking the hours that SCPD personnel spend providing language \nservices, currently called “Translation Hours” in the Monthly Activity Report.  The summary \ndata provided by SCPD shows that a handful of officers have spent significant time – equivalent \nto a week of work or more providing language access between January and November 2017.  A \nnumber of other officers have only had a very brief number of “Translation Hours” over the time \nperiod.   \n \nWe do commend SCPD for resuming testing and certification of personnel as Bilingual \nOfficers and DAIs.  The Community Services Bureau has received numerous requests from \nofficers who are interested in being tested.  This is in response to SCPD notifying all supervisors  \nof this testing and giving them a list of their self-identified second language speaker supervisees.  \nThere has also been some effective outreach to the Hispanic Society and clarification of \nmisinformation.  It appears that this outreach (and the immersion training referenced below) will \nincrease the number of available in-house language assistance resources.    \n \nFinally, we note the low volume of complaints and compliments in languages other than \nEnglish that SCPD is receiving.  The SCPD should work more closely with community-based \nservice providers to identify other ways of enabling complaints or comments from non-English \nspeakers. \n \n3.  Spanish Language Access to the SCPD Website \n \nThe SCPD has very recently updated its website and we were informed at the time of our \nvisit that the correct versions of many of the forms and documents are not yet imported.  We \nlook forward to the migration being complete and encourage the Department to invite members \nof the LEP community to tour the new site and see if they can navigate the site effectively and \nefficiently.  \n \nWhile SCPD did a comprehensive round of translating critical documents and has made \nthem available in precincts and on the website, the Department needs to maintain better quality \ncontrol over forms provided to the public in the precincts.  During our October 2017 visit, we \nfound that the LAP at the headquarters’ front desk was an outdated version.  In one of the \nprecincts, we found complaint/compliment forms were missing in some languages.  In more than \none precinct, there are still two different versions of the community survey available at the desks.  \nThese issues need to be resolved. \n \n4.  Incentives for Interpreters \n \nWe note that the Department has sought to incentivize personnel to participate in its \nlanguage assistance efforts through two effective means: (1) tracking activity reports, and (2) \ntransfers.  We were pleased to see that all officers’ monthly statistics will reflect the number of \nlanguage assistance hours.   \n \n \n \n \n \n14 | P age \n \n\n5.  Consultation with the Latino Community & Community Survey  \n \nAs noted before, the Agreement requires that SCPD survey community representatives \nregarding SCPD’s LEP efforts.  See Agreement ¶ V(h) at 10-11.  We have not seen progress in \nupdating the survey and actively surveying the public. The Department should move forward \nwith this effort and reach out to other agencies that have experience doing community surveying.  \nThe Department also should develop a dissemination strategy for the survey to enable \nrandomization and confidence in the representativeness of the findings.  \n \nThe Department reported challenges in its last consultation with community advocates, \nspecifically, that the advocates did not appear to represent the Latino community at large.  The \nDepartment is encouraged to do greater outreach to ensure that they are reaching representatives \nfrom diverse segments of the Latino community.  \n \n6.  Language Assistance Training  \n \nWe continue to be impressed with the current state of the language assistance training, as \nwell as the trainers’ active interest in keeping the content current.  We learned that the training \nofficers will be observed by a Suffolk Community College social activism class, representing \nmembers of the community, to provide instructors’ feedback.  This will not only help spread the \nmessage that the SCPD takes cultural competency and language access seriously, it will also \nensure that training is relevant to community concerns.   \n \nAs part of its efforts to meet the language assistance training requirements of the \nAgreement, SCPD has previously planned to provide Spanish language training to recruits and \nothers in the Department.  Those plans remain uncertain at this time.  We encourage SCPD to \nmove forward with that training and provide DOJ with training materials, or identify alternatives \nfor coming into full compliance with the training requirements of the Agreement.   \n \nD.  ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \n \nVI. ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Reporting Misconduct \nCompliance \n   b.  Investigation of Misconduct  Partial Compliance \n \nUnder the police misconduct reporting requirements of the Agreement, SCPD must have \na policy that requires all members to report allegations of discriminatory policing, ensures that \nall complaints are investigated, and allows third-persons to submit complaints on behalf of \nvictims.  Agreement ¶ V(a) at 11.  The Agreement also includes various provisions concerning \nthe investigation of misconduct, which are aimed at ensuring that all complaints are thoroughly \ninvestigated.  See Agreement ¶ V(b) at 11-12.  While the Department has maintained substantial \ncompliance with the reporting provisions of the Agreement during the last assessment period, the \n15 | P age \n \n\nDepartment continues to be in partial compliance with the investigation of misconduct \nrequirements of the Agreement for the reasons detailed below. \n1.  Reporting Misconduct \n \nThe Department’s Civilian Complaint Procedure, Order 15-56, and its ongoing \nimplementation of that order, continues to satisfy the three requirements of the Reporting \nMisconduct section of the Agreement: (1) members’ duty to report allegations of discriminatory \npolicing, (2) ensuring that the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) investigates all complaints \nregardless of how the complainant submits the complaint, and (3) allowing third parties to file \ncomplaints on behalf of victims.  See Fifth Assessment Report at 16; Agreement ¶ VI(a) at 11.  \nIn addition to complying with the provisions of this section, the Department has continued to \nundertake efforts not required by the Agreement to ensure robust reporting of misconduct.  \nSpecifically, SCPD has implemented an official policy that requires SCPD to keep complainants \napprised of the status of their complaint.  See SCPD Directive, Order No. 17-01, Mar. 17, 2017.  \nWe have commended the Department in the past, and do so again, for instituting the policy.  See \nFifth Assessment Report at 16.  By increasing transparency around the investigative process, and \nmaintaining an adequate level of responsiveness toward complainants, the Department will \nimprove the public’s perception of the validity of the internal affairs process.  We will continue \nto monitor this section of the Agreement, including any related policies, to ensure that SCPD \nremains in substantial compliance. \n \n2.  Investigating Misconduct \n \nThe provisions of the Agreement that address the Department’s misconduct \ninvestigations are designed to ensure that SCPD’s misconduct complaints are timely and \nthoroughly investigated, that IAB has qualified SCPD members serving as investigators, and that \nthe Department tracks and analyzes IAB investigations to ensure their quality and identify issues.  \nSee Agreement ¶ VI(b) at 11-12.  Over the past year, the Department has made it a priority to \nreduce the backlog of unresolved internal affairs investigations.  While we commend this effort, \nit appears that the Department continues to struggle with delays in completing and closing cases, \nand, thus, remains in partial compliance with this section of the Agreement.  We are encouraged, \nhowever, by the work that SCPD had done, and are hopeful that the Department will be able to \nobtain substantial compliance with this section of the Agreement during the next rating period if \nit continues on the same trajectory. \nThe Department has improved its recruitment of investigators, and the position has now \nbecome viewed as a stepping-stone for advancement within the Department.  See Agreement ¶ \nVI(b)(ii) at 11.  Indeed, since our last visit, SCPD promoted six of its IAB investigators to other \npositions within the Department.  The Department has also invested in the professional \ndevelopment of its investigators by sending them to trainings, such as a forensic science training \nand an internal investigations course.  By investing in the IAB in this manner, the Department \nwill continue to attract qualified candidates to the IAB and ensure a higher quality of \ninvestigations.   \nAs we noted in the Fifth Assessment Report, the Department has improved the quality of \nits discriminatory policing investigations.  Indeed, SCPD has instituted processes and methods to \nensure that complaints do not lag indefinitely without a final disposition.  Complaints are \n16 | P age \n \n\nassigned a unique identifier, and the Department now averages 48 to 72 hours referral time of \ncomplaints to IAB.  See SCPD, 2016 Annual Report on Biased Policing Complaints at 3.  We do \nnote that the Department should aim to reduce the average to 48 hours, as required by the \nAgreement.  See Agreement VI(b)(i) at 11.  The IAB uses a computer program, Blue Team, to \nreceive automatic notifications when a case has reached 120 days, allowing supervisors to \nintervene if needed.  The IAB notifies complainants by letter after 180 days if the investigation is \nongoing.  The Department also tracks its biased policing investigations, analyzes trends, and \npublishes its conclusions in an annual report.  These are all positive developments and we \ncommend SCPD for these efforts.     \nNonetheless, SCPD has not yet reached substantial compliance with the Agreement \nbecause of undue delays in the timely adjudication of its investigations.  The IAB has continued \nto work on clearing its backlog of unresolved cases and to investigate new cases in a timely \nmanner.  But our review of SCPD’s biased-policing investigations that the Department \ncompleted during this assessment period showed that investigations still suffer from unnecessary \ndelays at different stages of the investigation process.  Of the 14 cases that we reviewed, only \none took less than six months to resolve.  The complaints from 2015 had taken an average of two \nyears to complete; those from 2016 took an average of 11 months to complete.  See SCPD \nCompleted IA Investigations Since April 2017 (on file with DOJ).  Such delays can be \nfrustrating to complainants who are seeking accountability, and to the subject officers who do \nnot want the shadow of an IAB investigation looming over them. \nSpecifically, we found that delays often occurred in the time taken to interview the \nsubject officers or witnesses, or between the final investigator’s memo and the captain’s final \nreview.  In several cases, the investigators did not interview or obtain an internal memo from the \nsubject officer(s) for months after the alleged incident; in some cases, more than a year.  The \nsame pattern was evident with regard to witness interviews.  We would recommend that \ninvestigators interview all involved parties as soon as reasonably possible, both to ensure the \nmost accurate statements possible and to shorten undue delays.  With regard to the delay in the \nsupervisory reviews of the investigations, the Department suggested they we caused, at least in \npart, to the continued work on the backlog and the change in supervisory personnel.  In light of \nthe progressively smaller backlog, and the addition of a captain at IAB, we are hopeful that the \nIAB unit can address these delays in the coming assessment period. \nIn addition, there are several other more detailed concerns that we are hopeful SCPD can \naddress in the coming months.  First, SCPD should reemphasize that all allegations require a \nfinding at the conclusion of an investigation.  One of the biased-policing investigations we \nreviewed during this assessment period appeared not to make a finding on the allegation of \nbiased policing.  To be clear, the investigation itself was thorough; the investigator collected \nrelevant evidence, and conducted the necessary interviews.  However, the final report did not \ncontain a finding for the allegation of biased policing, which inhibits SCPD’s ability to review \naggregate complaint information to identify trends.  \nFurther, in a past compliance report, SCPD had represented that it would coalesce its \nrevised IAB Command General Orders into a unit manual by the end of this reporting period.  \nSee SCPD Compliance Report (March 2017) at 8.  During our visit, command staff informed us \nthat the Department no longer planned to create the manual.  We encouraged the Department not \nto abandon its plan to assemble all IAB policies as an IAB manual, as it would be beneficial for \nall members of the unit, and we suggested that the Department simply collect and publish all \n17 | P age \n \n\nIAB policies as an integrated document in order to minimize confusion.  The Department \ncommitted to providing its IAB internal orders for our review, including those it uses from \nLexipol (a provider of state-specific policies for law enforcement).  The Department provided its \ncurrent IAB policies, but, as of the writing of this report, we were still awaiting those from \nLexipol.  The policies that the Department did submit were basic IAB policies that provide \nsufficient guidance for investigators; however, we hope that supplementing the IAB policies with \nLexipol policies will provide a more robust foundation for IAB investigators. \nAs noted above, we are optimistic that the SCPD is nearing substantial compliance in this \narea of the Agreement.  Addressing the delays in resolving investigations will help make \nsignificant progress.  The completed compilation of IAB policies will ensure that the unit is \nequipped to provide its investigators the necessary guidance.  Accordingly, we will continue to \nmonitor these efforts, and look forward to the IAB’s 2017 annual report during the coming \nassessment period. \n \nE.     COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \n \nVII. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Maintaining Community Relationships  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Community Liaison Officers \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) \nCompliance \n   d.  Community Response Bureau  Partial Compliance \n   e.  Community Outreach  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial  \n   f.  Social Media and Notification Systems \nCompliance \n \nSCPD has developed a robust approach to community engagement since entry of the \nSettlement Agreement in 2014.  It has created new positions, both in headquarters and in each \nprecinct, to encourage and coordinate interaction and communication between the department \nand the community.  It holds regular meetings at the precinct level and countywide, and is \nbeginning to incorporate patrol officers into its engagement efforts.   \nOver this past reporting period, SCPD, in particular its Community Liaison Officers \n(CLO), Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (COPE) officers, and the command staff in \nits Community Response Bureau (CRB), continued to devote substantial time and energy toward \ncommunity engagement.  We continue to be impressed with the work of Police Commissioner \nSini, Sergeant Kathleen Kenneally, and Deputy Inspector Richard O’Carroll, newly appointed to \nhead the CRB.  Commissioner Sini’s personal involvement has communicated a commitment to \ncommunity engagement.   \n18 | P age \n \n\nWe also once again repeat our recommendation that SCPD make efforts to be more \nproactive, analytical, and strategic in seeking to engage with less traditional partners and the \nmore underserved parts of the Suffolk County community.  SCPD also should enhance its efforts \nto address current questions and concerns of the community through outreach and distribution of \ninformational materials.   \n1.      Maintaining Community Relationships and Community Outreach \n  The Department and its individual precincts continue to maintain a busy schedule of \ncommunity outreach events, including quarterly meetings with the Latino Community Outreach \nCommittee, monthly community meetings at the precincts, and popular programs such as sports \nprograms for local youth and trainings targeted at educating about the risks of opioid addiction.  \nIn addition, SCPD is continuing to meet its obligation of producing and publishing annual \nreports with its own analysis of the CRB’s successes, areas in need of improvement, and \nstrategies for making improvements, including posting these reports on its own website. \n \nWe continue to be impressed with the array of activities that the CLO and COPE officers \nplan and execute.  SCPD has maintained the compliance ratings it had achieved in the past \nreporting period, including substantial compliance in the areas of the Agreement directly relating \nto the responsibilities of the CLO and COPE officers.   \nCommissioner Sini’s quarterly meetings with Latino advocates have been more \nsuccessful than in the past.  However, both SCPD officials and community advocates describe \nthe meetings as unsatisfying.  Advocates still feel that many of their questions go unanswered \nand that SCPD officials do not address their concerns.  SCPD officials expressed that advocates \nattending the meeting made it difficult to have a dialogue.  We recommend that the meetings be \nrestructured, and perhaps held at a different time of day and location, to encourage additional \nparticipation and better communication. \nIn addition to officers specifically assigned to community outreach work, patrol officers \nshould be involved in their precincts’ community outreach events.  Patrol officers appear to be \nattending community outreach events organized by the CLO and COPE officers in their precincts \nmore often, including attending their precinct’s monthly community meetings.  We also learned \nthat new recruits are taught that engaging with the community is a central part of their duties, \nlargely due to the training on community-oriented policing they are receiving at the Police \nAcademy, an important means of incorporating community policing into the culture of the \nDepartment.  However, more still needs to be done to help every officer understand that \nimproved community relations is an integral part of their duties and that such work occurs every \nday, and not simply at organized events.   \n  To come into substantial compliance with the community engagement requirements of the \nAgreement, we recommend that SCPD focus on the following:  (1) effective implementation and \nuse at the CRB level and the precinct level of the computer systems for tracking and analysis of \ncommunity outreach events, and (2) creation and dissemination of written informational \nmaterials for the public.   \nWith respect to the first point, we recognize that the CRB has been working to refine the \ncomputer systems it uses for keeping track of community outreach events attended by officers \nand SCPD leadership.  However, this project has been going on for some time and we expected \nthat the system would be fully developed by now.  Until it is, SCPD cannot demonstrate that its \n19 | P age \n \n\nofficers are accurately and regularly conducting and recording their community outreach work, \nor that community contacts and supervisors at all levels possess sufficient information to \nmeasure and analyze the effectiveness of community outreach, which in turn impacts SCPD’s \nability to appropriately share information across precincts, to identify potential gaps in their \ncommunity outreach, and to strategize about how to improve the effectiveness and breadth of \ncommunity outreach.  Relatedly, we reiterate our previous recommendation that the CRB and the \nprecincts work together to identify and develop an effective means of consistently maintaining \nand sharing their calendars of community outreach events. The computer program designed to \nbuild a database of community contacts that can be shared within SCPD has been developed, but \nthere needs to be a training bulletin written and disseminated explaining how to use the database.   \nWe also note that the Agreement requires that SCPD “engage the public through the \ndissemination of public information on a regular basis.”  Agreement ¶ VII(a) at 12-13.  Although \nthis requirement falls under the Agreement’s community engagement provisions, it need not be \nthe exclusive responsibility of the CRB, or the CLO and COPE officers, to bring the Department \ninto compliance with this requirement and the community engagement provisions generally.  The \npublic information to be disseminated could include information about SCPD policies and \nprocedures that relate to functions of the SCPD other than the CRB—for example, the policies \nand processes relating to how members of the public may submit complaints about officer \nmisconduct.  In meetings with the Latino Community Outreach Committee, for example, \nCommissioner Sini has committed to creating informational materials regarding the use of \nadvocates as well as a timeline for reporting incidents to Internal Affairs that would be posted on \nour website in both English and Spanish.3   \n                In this way, the IAB and other components must play a central role in helping the CRB \nensure the provision of informational materials.  Moreover, creating and disseminating \ninformational materials to the public will not only help to bring SCPD into compliance with the \nAgreement, but also should foster greater trust and transparency between the community and \nSCPD.  We also recommend that SCPD assign responsibility within the Department for \nidentifying other types of informational materials that would be useful to the public, for \nfacilitating the creation of those materials in coordination with the relevant SCPD component, \nand for determining how SCPD will disseminate these materials to the public.  In light of the \nsignificant impact this will have on community engagement, the CRB may be the most \nappropriate component for this responsibility.   \n  We note that our conversations with community members reveal a persistent mistrust of \nSCPD.  As discussed above in the Language Access section of this Report, advocates have \nreported that treatment of LEP individuals calling SCPD was uneven.  The advocates also \nreported an instance where an LEP mother brought in her eight-year old son whom she suspected \nwas being sexually abused.  According to the advocates, the mother and child were made to wait \nthree hours to meet with a detective.  Incidents like these undermine SCPD’s efforts to improve \ncommunity relations.   \n \n                                                           \n3 Minutes of February 2016 Quarterly Meeting of SCPD and Latino Community Outreach Committee (on file with \nDOJ).  \n20 | P age \n \n\n2.   Community Liaison Officers, Community Oriented Policing Enforcement, and the \nCommunity Response Bureau  \n \nAs we noted above, SCPD has maintained a rating of substantial compliance with the \nprovisions of the Agreement relating to the responsibilities of the CLO and COPE officers.  \nSCPD’s efforts have improved during this rating period.  SCPD has assigned a new CLO to the \nFifth Precinct who was born in El Salvador and is Spanish speaking.  As a result, four of the \nseven precincts have a CLO or COPE Officer who speaks Spanish, and we continue to be \nimpressed with the dedication and expertise of the individual officers in these roles.  This is a \npositive development that will not only help restore trust between SCPD and the communities it \nserves, but will also better enable SCPD to prevent and fight crime by broadening its \npartnerships and expanding the range of individuals coordinating to protect public safety.     \n \n              For SCPD to “maintain robust community relationships and engage constructively with \nthe community to ensure collaborative problem-solving, ethical and bias-free policing, and \ncommunity confidence in the Department” in “all of its policing operations[,]” see Agreement at \n¶ VII(a), all officers and command staff will need to be involved, and not only the CLO and \nCOPE officers assigned to conduct community outreach.  We encourage SCPD to think \ncreatively and strategically about how to achieve these goals and demonstrate the adoption of \nsuch a philosophy.  This may involve strategies and actions outside of the traditional community \noutreach events organized by the CLO and COPE officers.  We encourage SCPD leadership to \nthink about community policing more broadly than community outreach events; for example, the \nDepartment’s community policing could include building relationships between the Department \nand other local governmental agencies, service providers, and community advocacy \norganizations.   \n   \nFinally, to achieve substantial compliance with the provisions of the Agreement relating \nto Community Outreach, and to maximize the impact of SCPD’s community engagement efforts, \nwe urge SCPD to finally develop and implement a community survey, as required by the \nAgreement.   We have repeatedly urged SCPD to make the survey a priority, as it is an important \nmeans of measuring the effectiveness and impact of its community outreach and engagement.    \nThis project has been underway for a substantial time, and needs to be completed as soon as \npossible.   \nCommissioner Sini has consistently recognized that building strong community \npartnerships throughout the entire Suffolk County community is critical to the Department’s \nability to effectively fight crime.  We commend SCPD for its efforts to date on building those \npartnerships, and stand ready to provide SCPD with technical assistance, including guidance \nfrom our subject matter experts, examples from other law enforcement agencies, and written \nresources, which may be useful to SCPD as it builds upon the significant progress already \nachieved.     \n \n \n \n \n \n21 | P age \n \n\nF.    POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY \n \nVII. POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY  Partial Compliance  \n \n The SCPD must “maintain policies and procedures that are consistent with [the] \nAgreement and that provide clear direction to ensure that officers and civilian employees enforce \nthe law effectively, ethically, and constitutionally.”  Agreement ¶ VIII(a) at 17.  While the \nDepartment is in substantial compliance with the bias-free policing policy and hate crimes policy \nrequirements of Agreements, its language assistance policy and policy on persons with limited \nEnglish proficiency continue to need work and thus remain in partial compliance.  As discussed \nabove in the Language Assistance section, we are encouraged by the steps the Department has \ntaken.  \n \nThe Agreement also requires that SCPD ensures that “all officers who take [required] \ntrainings will be required to pass a test demonstrating a basic comprehension of the training \nmaterial after it is presented.”  Id. ¶ VIII(b).  The Department has met this requirement with its \nhate crimes training.  However, the Department has not met this requirement for its language \nassistance training.  And, as discussed in the Bias-Free Policing section above, the Department \nbegins the train-the-trainer training for bias-free policing next fall.  Thus, we cannot assess its \ncompliance with this provision until then.   \n \n  \n \n22 | P age \n ",

As a\nresult, the department has terminated those provisions of the settlement agreement.\n“The County and its Police Department have made signiﬁcant progress towards ensuring that\nall Suffolk County residents beneﬁt from constitutional policing,” said Assistant Attorney\nGeneral Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “The Police Department\nhas improved the tracking of hate crimes, is strengthening the handling of internal affairs\ninvestigations and has improved the way it handles complaints of discriminatory policing. This\nprogress demonstrates that meaningful policing reform and change can be achieved through\nour work.

      "title": "Fourth Report Assessing Settlement Agreement Compliance by Suffolk County Police Department",
      "text": " \n \nFOURTH REPORT ASSESSING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \nCOMPLIANCE BY SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 19, 2017 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nIn January 2014, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Suffolk \nCounty Police Department (“SCPD” or the “Department”) entered into a Settlement Agreement \n(“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement”) to ensure that police services are provided to all \nmembers of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, in a manner that \ncomplies with the Constitution and laws of the United States.1  DOJ, as part of its responsibilities \nfor oversight of SCPD’s implementation of the Settlement Agreement, periodically reports on its \nassessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  This is the fourth Assessment Report.   \n \nSince we issued our last Assessment Report in April 2016 (the “Third Assessment \nReport”), DOJ representatives from both the Civil Rights Division and the United States \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York reviewed documents and materials \nprovided by SCPD, including revised policies and procedures, copies of internal affairs \ninvestigations, a sample of entries in SCPD’s community relations daily activity reporting \nsystem, and other reports completed during the time period covered by this report.  We also met \nwith SCPD officials, including Commissioner Timothy Sini, SCPD command staff and other \nsupervisors, and SCPD officers, toured precincts and participated in ride-alongs with on-duty \nofficers, attended training courses, and met with members of specialized units, including the \nHate Crimes Unit, the Internal Affairs Bureau, and the Community Response Bureau.  In \naddition, we solicited the views of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino \ncommunity, both by interviewing community members about their specific experiences with \nSCPD and by meeting with community advocates.  We also attended SCPD’s quarterly meeting \nwith advocates and members of the Latino community.  In conducting these activities, we \nconsulted with police practice experts with expertise in the areas of policing covered by the \nSettlement Agreement.     \n    \nWe thank the SCPD officials with whom we met during this assessment period, and we \nappreciate the cooperation and effort that SCPD and Suffolk County leadership continue to show \nin addressing the requirements of the Agreement.  We also thank the many members of the \nSuffolk County community who have met with us and provide us with invaluable feedback.  \n \nThis Assessment Report is divided into two sections.  First, we provide a compliance \nrating for each provision of the Settlement Agreement.  Second, we provide a more detailed \nanalysis of SCPD’s successes and challenges to date in each main area of the Agreement:  1) \nbias-free policing; 2) hate crimes and hate incidents; 3) language assistance; 4) allegations of \npolice misconduct; and 5) community engagement.   \n \nAs set forth in detail below, SCPD has made substantial progress in implementing the \nrequirements of the Settlement Agreement during the previous rating period, particularly with \nrespect to its Hate Crimes and Language Access training programs.  In other areas, considerable \nwork remains.   \n                                                           \n1  This Agreement is available in both English and Spanish at https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section-\ncases-and-matters0#police.  \n2 | P age \n \n\n \nOver the coming year, we will focus our attention on the Department’s efforts in the \nsubstantive areas of the Agreement with which the Department remains in partial compliance.  \nWe will, however, continue to assess the Department’s work in the areas where it already has \nachieved substantial compliance, in order to ensure that the Department maintains its progress in \nthose areas.  In conducting our assessment work, we will continue to communicate with SCPD \nofficers and command staff, both during regular phone calls and site visits.  We also will \ncontinue to meet with community members, both during larger-scale community outreach \nmeetings during our site visits and through ongoing meetings and communications with \nindividual community members and representatives.  We will publicly report on our observations \nof SCPD’s implementation of the Agreement in the Spring and Fall of 2017. \n \nII.   CURRENT COMPLIANCE RATINGS \n \nSection IX of the Settlement Agreement provides that, every six months, the United \nStates will assess and report on SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  See Agreement at 20.  \nThe compliance ratings below represent the United States’ current assessment of SCPD’s \ncompliance with each area of the Agreement.  While Section III of this Report provides more \ndetailed analysis of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, these ratings are included to \nprovide SCPD and the Suffolk County community with a clear and accurate summary of \nprogress to date, as well as areas that remain most in need of attention.   \n \nThe definition of each rating type is as follows: \n \n•  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  \n•  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.    \n•  “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement. \n•  “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation. \n \n \nStatus of \nSettlement Agreement Area \nCompliance  \nIII.

Training \nPending \n \n The Settlement Agreement contains specific provisions designed to ensure that SCPD \ndelivers police services that are “equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that \npromotes broad community engagement and confidence in the Department.”  Agreement at 4.  \nThe Agreement requires that “members of the public receive equal protection of the law, without \nbias based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation, and in \naccordance with the rights, privileges, and immunities secured or protected by the Constitution \nand laws of the United States.”  Id.  Successful implementation of these provisions requires that \nthe Department make bias-free policing a top priority and adopt training, supervision, data \ncollection, and accountability mechanisms that ensure law enforcement duties are being \nperformed free of impermissible bias.  While the Department has made some advances in this \narea, we expect significant progress to be made in the coming months, particularly with respect \nto traffic stop data collection and bias-free training.      \n \n1.   Policies and Procedures \n \nSCPD has made considerable progress in adopting appropriate policies and procedures in \nthis area but must continue to take steps to ensure that these policies and procedures are properly \nimplemented.   \n \n5 | P age \n \n\nA number of SCPD’s policies set forth appropriate guidance for officers.  For example, \nRules & Procedures Chapter 1, Section 11 prohibits officers from “us[ing] race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity when engaging in \nroutine or spontaneous law enforcement activities, except when engaging in appropriate suspect-\nspecific activity to identify a particular person or persons.”  The policy also emphasizes the \nimportance of building community trust, and requires SCPD members who become aware of \nbiased-based policing to immediately report the matter to a supervisor, who in turn must convey \nthe information to Internal Affairs.  SCPD policy also requires immediate referral of any \ncomplaint alleging discriminatory policing to the Internal Affairs Bureau.  See Rules & \nProcedures Chapter 5, Section 2.  Other policies and directives are well crafted to ensure that \nSCPD’s hiring, promotion, and performance assessment practices promote bias-free policing.  \nSee  Rules & Procedures Chapter 26, Section 1; Applicant Investigations Command General \nOrder 15-01 (prohibiting the hiring of any candidate who “has committed any discriminatory act \nor . . . evinces a biased perspective based upon race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or \nsexual orientation that indicates such candidate is not be able [sic] to perform the duties of police \nofficer in a non-discriminatory manner.”).  The promulgation of these policies marks an \nimportant step towards ensuring bias-free policing.    \n \nIn light of this significant progress, we have rated SCPD in “substantial compliance” with \nthis requirement.  Nonetheless, additional work is needed to ensure that these policies are \nadhered to in practice.  Specifically, the implementation of these policies requires appropriate \ntraining, which has not yet been developed, and appropriate data collection measures to assess \nwhether SCPD members are policing in a manner that complies with these policies, which also \ndo not yet exist.  As set forth below, these issues are specific areas of focus for SCPD in the next \nrating period.      \n \nAdditionally, as we noted in our last report, we note here that it is likely that SCPD or the \nUnited States will identify needed modifications to policies that have already been adopted.  We \nappreciate the Department’s continued willingness to consider and adopt policy \nrecommendations.     \n \n 2.    Traffic Stop Data \n \n A key requirement of the Settlement Agreement is the collection of meaningful and \naccurate traffic stop data to be able to identify any potential bias in conducting those stops.  See \nAgreement at 6.  Meeting this requirement is critical, as ensuring that policing services are \ndelivered in a manner free from bias requires the collection and analysis of accurate information \nregarding SCPD’s practices.   \n \nAs set forth in detail in our last Report, the data collected by SCPD omits critical \nvariables that are necessary for meaningful analysis of bias-free policing.  For example, SCPD \ndoes not collect any meaningful data regarding why a traffic stop was initiated.  By enhancing \nSCPD’s current data collection practices to include detailed information regarding why a stop \nwas initiated, SCPD will be able to evaluate whether similar offenses result in similar outcomes \nindependent of the race, ethnicity, or other protected characteristic of the driver or passenger, or \nare instead influenced by unlawful bias.  As another example, while SCPD collects data \nregarding whether an officer conducts a search during a traffic stop, critical data regarding \n6 | P age \n \n\nconducted searches is omitted, including whether a particular search revealed contraband, or not.  \nWithout this data, SCPD is unable to assess whether there are disparities in search practices that \nsuggest those practices are influenced by unlawful bias.   \n \nDuring this rating period, we met with representatives from SCPD’s patrol division and \ninformation technology department to determine how these enhanced data points can be \ncollected.  The substantive recommendations that we made regarding data collection are \nconsistent with the recommendations we made in a June 2015 letter to SCPD’s counsel and \nwithin our last assessment report.  During this meeting, SCPD also committed to a plan and \ntimeline for developing appropriate data collection methods consistent with our \nrecommendations.  That plan involves transitioning from a computerized data terminal system \ndeveloped by an outside vendor to a system developed within SCPD, which all allow SCPD to \ncontrol the substantive fields included.  Next, SCPD will ensure that those substantive fields \ncapture data agreed upon by the parties, and will solicit input from officers regarding ways to \nmake the data collection process more efficient and usable for officers.  This plan will allow \nSCPD to begin collecting appropriate data early in 2017.  We will continue to provide any \nassistance we can as the Department undertakes these efforts.   \n \nExpanding the range of data to be collected during traffic stops only has utility if officers \nconsistently complete traffic stop data collection forms, and if supervisors regularly review the \ndata that gets collected.  SCPD has been successful in ensuring that officers record information \nin their mobile data terminals.  Precinct supervisors have increased the attention placed on \nensuring these reports are filled out completely.  As a result, there has been a reduction in the \nproportion of traffic stop data that is left incomplete.  As the new traffic stop data collection \nsystem gets implemented, these efforts to maintain the consistent collection of data must \ncontinue.  Current efforts should be supplemented with quality assurance audits to confirm that \nofficers are completing traffic stop data forms appropriately.  \n \nOnce SCPD successfully implements enhanced data collection practices, SCPD must take \nmeaningful steps to ensure that collected data is analyzed and that appropriate measures are \ntaken when this analysis reveals problematic conduct.  The Settlement Agreement requires that, \nat least annually, SCPD provide the United States with a report containing this analysis and a \nsummary of the remedial measures taken, if any.  Agreement at 6.  Going forward, the United \nStates will work with SCPD to ensure this provision is implemented appropriately.   \n \nFinally, we renew our recommendation that SCPD supervisors incorporate a substantive \nreview of traffic stop data into their regular supervisory activities.  In our last report, we \nrecommended that SCPD provide updated training for supervisors, many of whom have not \nreceived supervisor-specific training since attaining the rank of sergeant.  We will continue to \nwork with SCPD to ensure that these or other measures are implemented to provide supervisors \nwith the training needed for how to incorporate traffic stop analysis into their regular supervisory \nduties.  \n \n 3.    Training \n \nEnsuring bias-free policing requires that officers receive effective training in how to \nconduct law enforcement activities in an equitable manner.  The Settlement Agreement requires \n7 | P age \n \n\nthat all sworn officers receive training on bias-free policing at least annually.  See Agreement at \n6-7.  The Agreement provides that SCPD’s training on bias-free policing “will emphasize that \ndiscriminatory policing, in the form of either selective enforcement or non-enforcement of the \nlaw, including the selecting or rejecting of particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited \nby policy and will subject officers to disciplinary action.”  Id.  The Agreement also sets forth \nspecific elements that must be incorporated into bias-free training.  Id.  \n \n As explained in detail in our last Assessment Report, SCPD’s revised bias-free policing \ntraining was both pedagogically and substantively deficient, and as a result, SCPD elected to \nsuspend the delivery of its bias-free policing training until appropriate training—consistent with \nthe requirements of the Agreement and best practices—could be developed.  See Third \nAssessment Report at 9.   \n \nTo assist SCPD, the Office of Justice Programs of the United States Department of \nJustice has agreed to provide SCPD with technical assistance in the form of training modules.  \nSpecifically, the Office of Justice Programs will provide SCPD with training programs on both \nprocedural justice and bias-free policing.  Further, SCPD has agreed on a training schedule that \nwill allow all SCPD officers to complete both procedural justice and bias-free policing within an \ninitial two-year period, with bias-free policing training recurring annually thereafter for all \nofficers.  This plan marks a significant commitment from SCPD to ensure that all SCPD officers \npolice in a manner that is consistent with constitutional requirements and provides equal \ntreatment to all community members.    \n \nWe are hopeful that this training can begin within the next several months.  The Office of \nJustice Programs is finalizing the training modules.  Once those modules are finalized, SCPD \nwill need to work with the Office of Justice Programs to ensure that the training modules are \nappropriately tailored to the specific rules and procedures of SCPD.  Once that process is \ncomplete, SCPD can begin delivery of this critical training.  Notably, since these modules are \n“train the trainer” models, SCPD will in the process be developing a capacity inside the \nDepartment to continue this training in the years to come.   \n \nWe have been impressed by SCPD’s commitment to bringing about this enhanced \nprocedural justice and bias-free policing training, and we will continue to work with SCPD, \nincluding command staff and the training academy, to provide any assistance that we can.  Going \nforward, we will assess whether SCPD is appropriately tailoring and delivering these training \nmodules in a manner that is consistent with the terms of the Agreement.  We will review training \ncurricula, observe training sessions, and meet with SCPD trainers and officers completing the \ntraining to assess effectiveness.  We will also continue to facilitate communication between \nSCPD and the Office of Justice Programs to help ensure this program is implemented in a timely \nfashion.  With respect to data collection, in the immediate months we will review SCPD’s \nproposed traffic stop data collection system to ensure that appropriate fields are included.  We \nwill also assess whether that revised system, once approved, is appropriately deployed, including \nwhether officers are appropriately trained in how to use that system and whether supervisors are \nensuring data is being collected consistently and accurately.  To accomplish these objectives, we \nwill continue to meet with officers, command staff, and others within the Department, including \nduring on-site visits.  And once accurate data is being collected, we will begin working with \nSCPD to ensure it is appropriately analyzed.   \n8 | P age \n \n\n          \nB.  HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \n \nIV. HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Training \nCompliance \n   b.  Tracking and Reporting  Partial Compliance \n   c.  Quality Assurance  Partial Compliance \n \nSCPD has continued to make significant strides in the area of hate crimes and hate \nincidents.  The Department successfully implemented many of the recommendations in our last \nAssessment Report, especially in the area of hate crimes training.  See Third Assessment Report \nat 10-12.  Thus, we find the Department in substantial compliance with the hate crimes training \nprovision of the Agreement.  While the Department has made marked improvements in the areas \nof hate crime tracking and quality assurance, it remains in partial compliance with those \nprovisions of the Agreement for the reasons discussed below. \n  \n1.  Training  \n \nSCPD has incorporated many of the recommendations that we had suggested in our last \nAssessment Report and has developed a training that uses an effective format and is \nsubstantively complete.  The instructors have achieved the proper tone and adequately convey \nthe purpose of hate crimes reporting and investigations: to protect community members who may \nbe victims of crime on the basis of their membership in a protected class, to increase police \nlegitimacy, and to send a message that hate crimes and hate incidents will not be tolerated. \n \nThe format for the hate crimes training that we observed in October 2016 was similar to \nthe format for the previous training that we had observed in March 2016, which we had found to \nbe very effective.  Again, the course opened with a road-map, listed the objectives, and clearly \ndetailed the topics to be covered.  The introduction laid out the community policing philosophy \nbehind the hate crimes training and the instructor incorporated a prepared lecture with slide and \nvideo presentations, small group discussions, and interactive role playing exercises.  Overall, the \nformat and delivery of content was very successful and students appeared genuinely engaged. \n \nIn our last Assessment Report, we raised concerns that that the hate crimes training \nlacked clarity regarding 1) the substance of the New York State Hate Crimes Statute, and 2) the \nprocess for determining whether an incident is a potential hate offense and its referral to Hate \nCrimes Unit (HCU).  See Third Assessment Report at 10-12.  SCPD has successfully addressed \nboth of these issues.  The instructor provided a clear and accurate explanation of the legal \nstandard under New York State Hate Crimes Law, NYSPL § 485.05(1a), and also distributed an \ninformational handout setting forth the law to the students.  Most importantly, the instructor did a \nvery good job of explaining the process by which an incident should be flagged as a potential \n9 | P age \n \n\nhate crime or hate incident and then referred to HCU for investigation.  While the previous \ntraining presented conflicting messages about the level of discretion that officers have in \nreferring incidents to HCU, the October 2016 training clearly laid out the requirement to notify a \nsupervisor whenever there is an incident may have been motivated by hate. \n \n2.  Tracking, Reporting, and Pattern Analyses \n \nThe tracking and mapping of crime allows police departments to examine crime trends \nand identify crime patterns, and thus to reduce or prevent crime.  To this end, it is paramount that \nthe graphic representations of crime patterns be shared department-wide with command staff and \nline officers, as well as the community.  During our visit, we learned that the monthly maps that \nHCU produces are sent to SCPD management but are not shared with line officers or published \nonline.  We suggest publishing or sharing the hate crimes maps department-wide so that officers \ncan engage and contribute to the process of identifying and addressing hate crimes and hate \nincidents. \nCurrently, HCU produces the hate crimes map on a monthly basis, beginning in January of \neach calendar year and aggregating data as the year progresses.  This results in a dearth of data at \nthe beginning of the year and creates the potential for missing hate crime patterns when the slate \nis wiped clean each January.  We suggest that the monthly maps incorporate data from the \nprevious twelve-month period at a minimum so that potential patterns of hate crimes will be \nmore apparent.  Additionally, the current representation of hate crimes and hate incidents that \nhave occurred at the same geolocation are layered, resulting in a visual under-representation of \nhate crimes.  We recommend jittering the dots for hate crimes that have occurred at the same \ngeolocation to provide users with more accurate visual depiction of the quantity of hate crimes or \nhate incidents. \nIn our last Assessment Report, we raised concerns about the information sharing, or lack \nthereof, between the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU) and the HCU.  See Third Assessment \nReport at 13.  In its July 2016 Compliance Report and during our October 2016 visit, the \nDepartment clarified that HCU is solely responsible for all hate crime tracking and mapping.  See \nFourth Compliance Report at 10-11.  While we understand that HCU is the entity solely \nresponsible for the hate crimes mapping, we continue to encourage the HCU and the CIU to \nwork together and develop a regular system of information sharing.  HCU should be comparing \nthe hate crime and hate incident patterns against other crime patterns in Suffolk County as part of \nits analysis to determine if connections to other crime exist or if there are leads it can pursue. \nUnder the Agreement, the Department currently produces an annual report mapping and \nanalyzing potential patterns and trends for all hate crimes and hate incidents.  See Agreement at \nIV(b)(ii).  In our meeting with HCU, we suggested producing the report on a bi-annual basis so \nthat the information available is more recent.  This would also allow potential patterns of hate \ncrimes to be addressed in a more timely fashion.  The HCU was receptive to this \nrecommendation. \n10 | P age \n \n\n3.  Quality Assurance2 \nSCPD’s hate crime investigations policy aims to ensure the effective identification and \ninvestigation of hate crimes, and for SCPD members to provide assistance to victims of hate \ncrimes.  See SCPD Hate Crimes GO 16-43.  This involves improving outreach and \ncommunication with community members.  See id.  Indeed, the HCU has reported that \n“[m]embers of the Hate Crimes Unit also continually educate Department personnel and \ncommunity members on the mechanics of Hate Crimes laws and the importance of reporting and \nproperly classifying incidents in order to ensure effective investigation and provision of \ncounseling services to victims.”  SCPD, Hate Crimes Unit: 2015 Patterns and Trends Analysis.   \nAt the same time, we encourage SCPD to enhance its efforts to educate and inform the \ncommunity about hate crimes and the hate crimes investigation process.  Doing so may help the \nHCU stay informed about potentially criminal activity.  Additionally, while SCPD is limited in \nwhat it can do when acts do not rise to the level of a hate crime or hate incident, we recommend \nthat SCPD encourage people who have been subject to such threats to continue to register them \nwith the Department.    HCU detectives told us about a recent assault on an African-American \nwoman that had been charged as a hate crime.  The victim had called SCPD a year-and-a-half \nearlier, when the same perpetrator had threatened her and used racial slurs against her.  At the \ntime, HCU could not investigate the incident as a potential hate crime because it did not meet the \nlegal standard for a hate crime or hate incident.  In this instance, detectives learned that the \nvictim had experienced several encounters in which the perpetrator had threatened her or her \nfamily members in the time between her first call to SCPD in April 2015 and the stabbing in \nOctober 2016.  However, the victim did not report these incidents to SCPD and detectives were \nnot able to monitor the interactions.   \nThe Department has met the requirement of conducting random audits of its hate crimes \ninvestigations every six months.  We agree with the Department that it continues to be in partial \ncompliance with this provision of the Agreement.  See Fourth Compliance Report at 11.  While \nthe report provides summaries of the investigations audited, it does not provide any analysis of \nthe quality of the investigations or “any corrective actions planned or taken as a result of the \naudits” as required under the Agreement.  See Agreement at 11.   \nIn our last Assessment Report, we had recommended that SCPD revise its outreach signs \nthat solicit tips about hate crimes to specifically inform the public about hate crimes and hate \ncrime reporting.  See Third Assessment Report at 13-14.  The HCU provided us with the \nproposed language for the sign during our October 2016 visit, which we will review and provide \nfeedback on. \nWe look forward to working with SCPD as it makes progress toward substantial \ncompliance in the hate crimes areas that remain in partial compliance—tracking and reporting \n                                                           \n2 In its July 2016 Compliance Report, SCPD states that our Second Assessment Report found the Department to be \nin substantial compliance with the quality assurance provision of the hate crimes section of the Agreement.  See \nSCPD Fourth Compliance Report 11.  However, the Department was found to be in partial compliance, not \nsubstantial compliance, with this provision in our June 26, 2015 Assessment.  See Second Assessment Report 7, \navailable at https://www.justice.gov/crt/file/706761/download.  \n11 | P age \n \n\nand quality assurance.  To help the Department meet the requirements of the Agreement we will \nreview HCU’s monthly maps and provide feedback.  We expect by incorporating the \nrecommendations we have made regarding these maps, SCPD will be able to better analyze \npatterns of potential hate crimes or hate incidents in Suffolk County.  Likewise, we will \ncollaborate with HCU to improve its random audits so that they can better capture the scope of \nthe investigations, and identify gaps and corrective action to address those gaps.  DOJ will \nfollow-up with SCPD to schedule bi-monthly strategy meetings to achieve these goals.  We will \nalso continue to meet with HCU representatives on-site to continue to monitor implementation of \nthe Agreement.   \n \nC.  LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE \n \nV.

Policy on Persons with Limited English Proficiency  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial  \n   d.  Spanish-language access to SCPD website \nCompliance \n   e.  Incentives for Interpreters  Noncompliance \n   f.  Consultation with the Latino Community  Partial Compliance \n   g.  Language Assistance Training  Partial Compliance \n   h.  Community Survey  Partial Compliance \n \n  One of the cornerstone elements of the Agreement is the requirement that SCPD develop \na robust Language Assistance program, to ensure that police officers and others in the \nDepartment are able to communicate effectively with individuals in the community who have \nLimited English Proficiency (“LEP”).  See Agreement at 8-11. Such communication is vital for \nensuring that SCPD provides LEP crime victims appropriate police services, effectively \ninvestigates crimes occurring in the county, and protects the civil and constitutional rights of \nLEP individuals who are arrested or otherwise charged with criminal conduct.  More broadly, \nthis communication is vital for ensuring that the Department is held accountable for serving all \nmembers of the community, including LEP individuals and others who are particularly \nvulnerable to victimization or marginalization in the criminal justice system.  \n  As noted below, although SCPD has written a comprehensive policy on language access, \nthat policy is not yet being properly implemented.  While there is a greater awareness of the \nDepartment’s commitment to language access, there is not yet an agency-wide commitment to \nproviding language assistance whenever it is needed.  We hope and expect that this will improve \n12 | P age \n \n\nwith enhancements to the Language Access training program and as more Department personnel \nreceive the training, along with improved review and enforcement of language assistance in the \nfield.  \n1.  Language Access Policy \n  SCPD has made developed and formalized appropriate policies and practices with respect \nto LEP individuals over the last two and a half years. It now has in place a strong, integrated \nLanguage Access Plan (“LAP”).  Rules & Procedures Chapter 26, Section 5. However, one \nimportant policy change was identified during this visit.  The LAP Section VI.C.4. a-c currently \nauthorizes only Department Authorized Interpreters (DAI)--and not qualified bilingual \nemployees who have demonstrated through testing sufficient proficiency in a non-English \nlanguage--to take LEP suspect, victim, witness, and complainant statements.  This reduces \nsignificantly the pool of approved individuals who can take such statements.  Concededly, there \nis an important distinction between the skills required for interpretation and bilingualism.  It is \npreferable to use DAIs wherever possible.  However, bilingual fluency can be sufficient in \ncertain circumstances, such as taking witness statements in non-custodial settings, which should \nbe clearly delineated and set forth in policy.     \n  Further, as noted in the last memo, while the LAP is helpful in its detail, we \nrecommended that SCPD prepare at least one distilled version of the policy, one to two pages \nlong, to assist members of service, particularly line officers, to understand and effectively \nimplement the policy.  During this tour, we reviewed a few draft versions of the policy.  \nHowever, they were not accurately targeted at the officer.  With some revisions, the current draft \ncould be useful for the public, as it summarizes the main points of the requirements of the \nAgreement with respect to Language Access.  What officers need is different; they need a \nsummary of the LAP that hones in on the key operational aspects of language access, as it relates \nto their roles in the field, at precinct desks, during interviews, etc.  A summary that fits inside \nofficers’ memo books will ensure that the LAP is as accessible as other written resources.  The \nsummary document for the community could come in a number of different forms, including one \nfor the community.  Every member of Suffolk County’s LEP community should know that s/he \ncould communicate with the police department in their primary (best) language.  And they \nshould be able to request this during any interaction without pushback.  \n  The LAP has been appropriately translated into Spanish and the other priority languages.  \nSCPD has consistently distributed the Spanish version of the LAP at SCPD facilities and \nmaintains a copy on its website in five of the priority languages.  However, it appears that there \nmay be different versions of the LAP depending on the language, on the website.  The current \nEnglish version is dated 5/13/16, while the Spanish, Chinese, Italian and Portuguese, versions are \ndated 4/12/2015. The Haitian Creole version is dated 12/4/2015, and the Polish version was \ndated Kwietnia 12 (April 12), 2015.  During our tour, it did appear that desk officers were aware \nof the LAP and it was available in English and Spanish for visitors to the precinct to review and \ntake.  \n  It is unclear if community stakeholders have reviewed policies translated into languages \nother than Spanish to ensure that the translations are appropriate for local linguistic communities.  \nWe see that the LAP was translated into Simplified Chinese, to match the linguistic \n13 | P age \n \n\ndemographics of the local Chinese population, but the Complaint/Compliment form (PDCS \n1300-1a) is in Traditional Chinese online.  We recommend that the SCPD develop its own \nnetwork of multi-lingual advisors to ensure that everything that is translated is written in plain \nlanguage and matches the predominant languages in the county.  As noted in the last memo, we \ncontinue to encourage the Department to widen its distribution of the LAP.  \n2.  Training  \n  We had the opportunity to sit in on the four-hour language access training, including a \nsegment on cultural competency.  We also shared substantive feedback with the trainers \nimmediately following the training.  Below, we highlight elements of that feedback, along with a \nfew additional points. \n  The language access training we observed was clearly the strongest we have seen to date; \nthere were some excellent components.  Specifically, the content and presentation of the first \nthird of the training was the strongest.  There was excellent use of small groups and large group \ndiscussion and the officers attending the training appeared to be engaged and interested in the \ncontent.  The remaining two-thirds of the training effectively covered the most important aspects \nof language access.  However, it lacked the group engagement and optimal application of adult \nlearning best practices.  It was predominantly a mix of lecture and videos.  While the use of \nvideos was mostly effective, there were many opportunities for further engaging the group, \nthrough large group discussions and small group exercises, role plays, scenario-based \ndiscussions, and case reviews.  These techniques can help leverage the participants’ relevant \nprior experiences and the real-world applications of language access in the SCPD.  \n  The training on how and when to employ bilingual officers and Department Authorized \nInterpreters (DAIs) can be further strengthened.  The flow chart on “Engaging an LEP \nIndividual” should be revised so that officers can get a clear understanding of the options and \ndecisions to make in such situations.  Pedagogically, instructors should engage students in \ndiscussion and brainstorming about the importance of and adjustments in thinking required by \nencountering LEP individuals, the reasons for the new procedures, and understanding why, for \nexample, the Department should no longer use children as interpreters. \n  Further, we have concerns about SCPD relying on limited Spanish-language training for \nSCPD officers as a means of providing meaningful language access for the Spanish-speaking \nLEP community.  This training is inadequate as a means of equipping officers to effectively \ncommunicate with Spanish-speaking LEP individuals, even for emergency situations.  To the \nextent that SCPD wishes to assist officers who would like to learn Spanish, we recommend that \nsuch Spanish-language training be separate from any language access training and that SCPD \nview it as distinct from its implementation of the language access provisions of the Agreement. \n Further, in order to maximize the potential impact of language training on SCPD’s ability to \neffectively serve the Spanish-speaking LEP community, we recommend that any Spanish-\nlanguage training for SCPD officers be tailored to help officers who already have a strong \nfoundation improve to the point where they can pass the bilingual exam.  \n  Trainers discussed the Language Assistance Tracking forms appropriately and in \nsufficient detail during the training.  Trainers also explained the purpose and process of these \n14 | P age \n \n\nforms in detail.  This aspect of the training could have been strengthened further if participants \nwere given copies of all of the relevant screen shots of the CAD shown on the PowerPoint.  \nLikewise, it was quite effective to ask participants to complete the tracking forms for the two \nsituations they analyzed in the training; instead of the teacher reading off the answers, the \nstudents should be called on to share their answers for each of the fields.  Once it is finalized the \ninstructors should review a distilled version of the LAP at the end of the program as a final \ntakeaway, rather than just referencing the LAP.  \n  Finally, we note the language access instruction preceded the hate crimes training.  This \npairing works well, particularly if one of the scenarios in the language access training is about a \nhate crime case and the hate crime training discusses how to overcome language barriers in hate \ncrimes identification and investigations.  \n3.  Implementation of LAP in the Field  \n  As more officers and supervisors are trained in Language Assistance, we expect the use \nof Language Assistance tools, including DAIs and Language Line, to become more widespread.  \nAt present, however, officers appear to continue to lack recognition of the need for use of \nlanguage access services.  Supervisors need to act as agents of these changes and take ownership \nof this much-needed culture change in the Department.  \n  Officers still appear to be improperly relying upon bystanders and children for language \nassistance.  During this visit, we heard first-hand that some officers continue to use bystanders \nand children and do not understand why they should not continue to do so.  This attitude is \nelucidated by the analysis performed by the SCPD of Lima calls (any call that a 911 dispatcher \nreceives for which language assistance is indicated is assigned a “Lima” code) where officers \nultimately determined that no language assistance was required.  SCPD reviewed 144 Lima calls \nwhere officers determined no language assistance was required on site.  Only four of those calls \nwere properly closed without language assistance, however, indicating that officers require \nconsiderably more understanding of the requirements regarding use of language assistance \nservices.   \n  One other way of increasing use of language assistance services is for the \nCommunications Section to inform LEP individuals who call 911 that they are entitled to an \ninterpreter at no cost if they cannot communicate with the police officer due to a language \nbarrier.  Educating LEP individuals of their rights can help ensure that Suffolk residents get the \npolice services they deserve.    \n  We also heard complaints from officers who experienced problems with Language Line.  \nSpecifically, officers told us that they had not always received appropriate assistance.  One \nofficer recounted a situation where he requested a Mandarin Chinese speaking interpreter and \nwas repeatedly connected to interpreters who spoke Spanish.  Language Line audits by IAB also \nrevealed that three out of 19 calls reviewed were disconnected.  While the information currently \ngathered during these audits is useful, the overall monitoring and quality assurance of Language \nLine that IAB conducts requires significant improvement.  These audits should include a broader \nrange of information, such as the duration of each call before connection to Language Line, and \nwhether or not an effort was made to explain that the caller would be put on hold.  IAB also \n15 | P age \n \n\ncontacts members of the public and other reviews of Lima calls.  However, this work is \nperformed by just one Captain and one Sergeant in IAB.  Because of their other extensive duties, \ntheir ability to conduct the reviews and audits is limited.  Supervisory Detectives are not needed \nto conduct much of this work; we recommend utilizing civilian staff or a dedicated line officer \nfor much of this work.   \n4.  Implementation of Language Assistance in the 911 Call Center  \n  As noted above, the Communications Section has developed excellent systems to identify \nand respond to calls it receives from LEP individuals.  In addition to employing bilingual \noperators, all operators have instant access to Language Line, and reported using it frequently.  \nTo date, a total of 10 dispatchers have been tested and certified as bilingual employees.  \n  As noted above, SCPD’s analysis of Language Access Tracking data revealed that the \ndispatchers’ assessment of language assistance needs was highly accurate.  The Department \nshould consider if it would be prudent to make a policy decision that all calls with a Lima \ndesignation automatically receive a bilingual, DAI, or Language Line assignment.  Another \nrecommendation is that all dispatchers end their communication with an LEP caller with a \nstatement that the caller can at any time request an interpreter during their interaction with the \nresponding police officers, and an interpreter will be provided, free of charge.  \n5.  Tracking Use of Language Access Assistance \n  It has now been more than six months since SCPD implemented a Language Assistance \ndispatch and tracking program using the CAD system in patrol cars.  Any call that a 911 \ndispatcher receives for which language assistance is indicated is assigned a “Lima” code.  Before \nan officer is able to close out a call with a Lima designation, the officer must complete a \nLanguage Assistance Tracking form in the CAD system that indicates, among other things, what \nlanguage assistance, if any, was provided on the call.  As noted in our last memo, the forms \nprovide valuable information to the Department on compliance with the policy, gaps in service, \nand other emerging needs.  \n  However, as noted above, implementation of the Lima program is poor.  In a September \n2016 audit, SCPD reviewed 144 incoming Lima 911 calls received in a thirty-day period \nbetween June and July for which officers indicated no language assistance was needed in the \nfield because “the victim/complainant spoke sufficient English to communicate.”  The audit \nshowed that of the 144 instances, individuals in the field requested an interpreter 94 times, while \n36 were unable to communicate with officers.3  This is of significant concern; officers must \nbecome more aware of the need to use language access services.  Further, more robust analysis is \nneeded to understand why officers decline to use language access services so frequently. \n \n                                                           \n3 The status of the other 10 calls is unclear.   \n16 | P age \n \n\n6.  Qualification of DAIs and Bilingual Officers \n  We understand that a total of 34 staff members have been deemed qualified bilingual \nemployees, that three staff have been deemed DAIs, and that there is a long list of staff who are \nwaiting testing and qualification.  There was a hold placed on subsequent training in the summer \ndue to budget and contractual issues; we were told that very recently, a total of $25,000 has been \nidentified and allocated for future training and a sole source contract was signed with Language \nLine Services in early October.   \n  We received considerable feedback from personnel who had both passed the bilingual \nexam and not passed the DAI exam.  Both tests need to be better tailored to fit the unique \nrealities of law enforcement.  From our conversations with test takers, the bilingual test lacks \nsufficient policing or criminal justice-related content.  Multiple test takers reported having to \nanswer questions about politics (e.g., the election, climate change), anthropology, and other \ntopics that appeared to be completely irrelevant and needlessly difficult to speak about.  Instead, \nfor example, test takers could be asked to give descriptions of people – skin color, clothing, \nheight, weight or explain the direction of flight of a suspect.   \n  Similarly, the DAI test needs to be adapted to the types of interactions that police officers \nengage in.  We have been told that the DAI appears to be oriented towards court interpreters, \nwho are required to memorize and repeat large chunks of information without being able to stop \nspeakers or ask them to repeat themselves or slow down.  It does not account for the level of \ncontrol and flow of police-community conversations.  \n  Finally, we recommend that SCPD hold preparatory sessions for individuals taking the \nbilingual or DAI test.  Test takers should be briefed on the process of the testing (which requires \nquick responses and interaction with the phone and can benefit from ready access to a pen and \npaper) and the purpose and process of each type of test. All test takers should be accommodated \nin a quiet room for taking the test.  The SCPD could also request that the Language Line testers \nallow all test takers to do a practice question before commencing the graded portion of the test.  \n7.  Incentives for Officers to Become DAIs and Bilingual Officers \n  The Department has yet to determine what incentives it will offer to officers to become \nDAIs and bilingual officers.  This must be addressed as soon as possible.  Further, we were told \nthat a bilingual officer who assists a non-bilingual officer becomes the primary officer on the \ncase and becomes responsible for the call and all of the associated paperwork.  This acts as a \ndisincentive to officers to become qualified as bilingual.  As we recommended during the visit, \nelimination of this disincentive is relatively straightforward; the bilingual officer should be \nrequired only to complete a supplemental report just as any secondary responding officer would. \n8.  Translation of Critical Documents \n  SCPD has translated many critical documents, including, importantly, the \ncomplaint/compliment form, into Spanish, Haitian Creole, Italian, Polish, and Portuguese.  The \ncritical documents translated into Chinese are divided between those that are available in \nTraditional Chinese and those available in Simplified Chinese.  The documents on the website \n17 | P age \n \n\navailable in Simplified Chinese include the following: How to obtain a police report, PDCS-\n8100j; Crime Victim Information Report, PDCS-8105b; and What to Do when Stopped by Police \nPDCS-7148b. The documents online in Traditional Chinese include the Missing Persons \nGuidelines, the Special Needs/Silver Alert PDCS-8060d, Family Offense Assistance and Court \nProcedures PDCS-7109p, and Mental Health Assistance, PDCS-7146c, Compliment Complaint \nform, PDCS-1300-1a; these have not yet been posted on the website with Simplified Chinese \ntranslations. \n  The Department is still in the process of developing online submission capability for \ncomplaints/compliments, as well as the translation of the complaint/compliment form into other \nnon-English languages, as appropriate.  However, review of SCPD’s website provides no \nevidence of the complaint/compliment phone line on the “contact us” page, and the line is not \nmentioned on the “Información en Español” page (the number for the community response \nbureau is provided).  This could be one reason that SCPD reports that it has received so few \npieces of correspondence in a language other than English.  \n  It does not appear that the SCPD has assessed any possible barriers to receiving \ncorrespondence in languages other than English, and/or developed strategies to effectively \novercome them.  There may be a need to publicize that the Department will accept \ncorrespondence in languages other than English and that it will translate the written \ncommunications.  Indeed, community advocates reiterated to us their view that the broader \npublic is not aware of this complaint line.  Likewise, the Spanish version of the \ncomplaint/compliment form does not have a note that the phone operators speak Spanish or any \nother language.  \n  We repeat our recommendation that SCPD add a header or footer to all translated \ndocuments identifying (in English) the foreign language in which the document has been \ntranslated and the date of the last update to the translation.  The “Missing Persons Guidelines” \ndocument on the website does have a header listing the language, but it does not include a date.  \nThe best practice of including a date makes it easy for officers to access appropriate translations \nof forms and documents and ensure up-to-date information is available to the public.  In addition \nto identifying potential different versions of the LAP by language (as noted above), we identified \ntwo different versions of the English version of the community survey available in one of the \nprecincts.  Going forward, our expectation is that use of Language Access Services, including \nLanguage Line, will increase.  This will occur so long as training continues to strengthen and \nofficers develop a better understanding of the need to use appropriate language access services, \nrather than bystanders or family members.  SCPD needs to immediately develop firm incentives \nfor officers to become DAIs and/or qualified bilingual members so that the number of such staff \navailable to provide interpretation services grows.  Enhanced auditing and review of Lima calls \nwill also be required, to ensure that language access services are in fact provided properly. \n  Over the coming year, we expect to continue to observe and offer support and \nrecommendations for enhancing the language access training program.  We also anticipate \nconducting additional interviews with officers in the field, during ride-alongs and in meetings, \nregarding their understanding of language access protocols and their experiences in using \nlanguage access services.  We will also review data regarding the use of language access \n18 | P age \n \n\nservices.  Finally, we will continue to meet with community representatives to learn of their \nexperiences in receiving language access services in interactions with SCPD members. \n \nD.  ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \n \nVI. ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Reporting Misconduct  Partial Compliance \n   b.  Investigation of Misconduct  Partial Compliance \n \nAs we discussed in our April 2016 report, SCPD has made significant reforms to the \norganizational structure of its Internal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”) over the past year, and the Police \nCommissioner, other SCPD leadership, and the new command staff at IAB have made it a \npriority to enhance the stature of the IAB and to tackle the backlog of unresolved IAB \ninvestigations.  We welcome these changes and already have observed the positive impact they \nare having on the timeliness and effectiveness of SCPD’s internal investigations; we also \nrecognize that the Department has achieved a substantial reduction in the backlog of unresolved \ninvestigations.  In addition, we were encouraged to learn that the IAB has adopted practices to \nimprove and increase its communication with individuals submitting complaints.  These \nmeasures remain relatively new, informal, and largely unknown to the public, however; thus we \nwill continue to monitor the Department’s progress in implementing these procedures and, as \ndiscussed further below, recommend that the Department take steps to clarify and formalize \nthese procedures both within the IAB and to the public.  Going forward, we also will consider \nthe impact of the changes to the IAB’s organizational structure and the extent to which the IAB \nis able to continue reducing the backlog of unresolved IAB investigations while still improving \nthe timeliness and effectiveness of its handling of new investigations.  We describe SCPD’s \nareas of improvement and our outstanding concerns in more detail below. \n \n1.   Reporting Misconduct \n \n  In our April 2016 report, we urged SCPD to increase and improve its communication \nwith complainants outside the Department, in particular, by increasing and improving the \ninformation provided to complainants about the progress and resolution of the investigations of \ntheir complaints.  We are encouraged that the Department appears to have considered and acted \nupon that recommendation.  Since the time of our last report, the IAB command staff has \nproposed time frames for when to contact complainants in writing to confirm receipt of their \ncomplaint, when to interview complainants following the receipt of their complaint, and at what \npoints throughout the life cycle of an investigation to provide complainants with written updates \nabout the status of the investigation.  These are important and welcome changes, and we expect \nthat they will both increase the community’s confidence in SCPD and the effectiveness of the \nIAB’s investigations.   \n \nBased on our review of recently closed internal affairs investigations, interviews with \nIAB personnel, and input from members of the community, however, it is our impression that \nthese procedures are not yet being consistently understood or applied by the IAB, and also that \n19 | P age \n \n\nthe public is not yet aware of these procedures.  For example, of the three most recently closed \ninternal affairs investigations, all of which were opened within the first half of 2016 and \ncompleted in October 2016, only one of the case files included a copy of the “acknowledgement \nof complaint” letter that is supposed to be sent to complainants within 24 hours of the receipt of a \ncomplaint.  (In that case, the acknowledgment letter was in fact sent to the complainant on June \n24, 2016, the very same day the complaint was received by the IAB.)  In the other two cases, the \nfile did not include a copy of the “acknowledgment of complaint” letter or any other indication \nof correspondence or communication with the complainant, whether about the receipt of the \ncomplaint, updates about the status of the investigation, or even about the final outcome of the \ninvestigation.  Thus, either it is not yet a standard part of IAB’s practice to send a letter to \ncomplainants within 24 hours of receiving a complaint or to correspond with them at regular \nintervals throughout the investigation, or such communication is not currently reflected in \nSCPD’s internal affairs investigative case files and is therefore unable to be tracked and verified \nby IAB supervisors.  Similarly, in our interviews with IAB personnel, we heard considerable \nvariation in their descriptions of when and how they would contact complainants, and also about \nhow they knew about the newly instituted procedures and timelines for communication with \ncomplainants.  We heard, for example, that guidance about the new procedures had been \nprovided to them by e-mail and by verbal instructions from their supervisors.  In addition, it \nappeared to depend somewhat on individual investigator’s practice as to how and when they \nwould communicate with complainants.  Whereas some personnel reported relying on an \nautomated system to alert them that it was time to send out a letter to complainants, one \ninvestigator described to us his personal practice of communicating with complainants well \nbefore the deadlines described in the new IAB procedures.  In addition, our feedback from \ncommunity advocates and individuals indicates that the public either has no information, or has \nmisinformation, about when to expect to hear from SCPD about investigations of their \ncomplaints.  Based upon this information, we find that there is inconsistency, both internally and \nin the public’s understanding, regarding SCPD’s practices and procedures for communicating \nwith complainants about internal affairs investigations. \n \n  With that in mind, we strongly recommend that SCPD formalize its new procedures and \ntimelines for communication with complainants about internal affairs investigations.  We \nspecifically recommend memorializing these procedures in SCPD policy or standard operating \nprocedures.  We also recommend clearly assigning responsibility to appropriate personnel, for \nexample to case managers and to supervisors, for ensuring that notifications are sent out to \ncomplainants in accordance with these procedures and timelines.  In so doing, we also \nrecommend that SCPD continue to assess whether the interim timelines for communication with \ncomplainants are the correct ones.  We have some concern, for example, that the current proposal \nmay focus too intensely on making contact with the complainant in the short term after initial \nreceipt of a complaint, but then allow too much time to pass between the required periodic \nupdates to complainants about the status of the investigation.  Allowing too much time to lapse \nbetween investigators’ contacts with complainants may compromise the complainant’s, and the \npublic’s, confidence in the investigative process, and also risk having the investigator lose \ncontact with the complainant altogether.  Finally, especially if the IAB continues to rely on its \ncurrent proposed timelines, we would urge investigators to consider these timelines as the \noutside limit for when to contact complainants, as opposed to waiting until the end of the \nrequired time period, or until investigators receive an alert from an automated system, to prompt \nthem to contact a complainant.   \n20 | P age \n \n\n \n  In addition, we strongly recommend that SCPD take steps to inform the public about its \nprocedures and timelines for communication with complainants.  For instance, this information \ncould be easily, but effectively, included in the “acknowledgment of complaint” letter sent to \ncomplainants and on the SCPD website, as well as in the various brief handouts and pamphlets \nthat the SCPD has been distributing at its community outreach events.  We believe this could go \na long way toward better informing the public and thus increasing the public’s confidence in the \nintegrity of SCPD’s internal affairs investigations and of the department overall.     \n \n  Along these same lines, SCPD still has not made clear to the community the specifics \nregarding SCPD’s policies and procedures for taking complaints submitted by third parties.  In \nour April 2016 report, we noted that individuals and advocates had reported encountering \nproblems with submitting third party complaints.  Since that time, we were encouraged to hear, \nconsistently, from SCPD officers and command staff that SCPD and the IAB are committed to \ntreating complaints from third parties in the same manner as a complaint submitted directly by \nthe affected individual.  We remain concerned, however, that this message is not being \ntransmitted effectively to the public.  Moreover, we heard a related concern from the community \nthat advocates are not being permitted to accompany complainants in their interviews by IAB \ninvestigators; and, in our meetings with SCPD leadership, they confirmed that the IAB practice \nhas been not to permit complainants to be accompanied by advocates in their interviews.  In light \nof these concerns, we recommend that SCPD make plain to the public that complaints submitted \nto the IAB by third parties will be received and treated in the same manner as any other \ncomplaint.  We also recommend that the IAB seriously consider altering its practice to allow \ncomplainants to be accompanied by advocates in their interviews and other meetings with IAB, \nto the extent that complainants wish to have such advocate participation. \n \nIn addition, we renew our recommendation, discussed in more detail in our April 2016 \nreport, that SCPD and IAB continue to develop and expand upon their work measuring and \nassessing trends in their internal affairs investigations.  Although we acknowledge that SCPD has \nstarted to identify and assess trends in its internal investigations, SCPD needs to continue to \ndevelop and expand upon this assessment, for example by looking at trends over a longer time \nperiod than it has done to date and, importantly, by measuring and analyzing the time periods \nbetween different stages in the life cycle of an internal affairs investigation.  In our meetings \nwith IAB personnel and leadership, for example, it appeared that IAB could not easily give us \ninformation about the average period of time for resolving current investigations, or about how \nthe length of time needed to resolve an investigation compared across recent years.  Similarly, it \ndoes not appear that IAB personnel or leadership gleans any useful information, or develops any \nrecommendations for changes in practice, from the analysis it does perform of trends in their \ninternal affairs investigations.  We would stress that, rather than viewing this type of analysis as \na requirement that the Department must undertake in order to meet its obligations under the \nAgreement, it should use this analysis to support the Department’s consideration of the \neffectiveness of their investigations and law enforcement procedures, overall. \n \n2.   Investigating Misconduct \n \nSCPD has made significant reforms to the organizational structure of its IAB within the \npast year, with the expressed aim of enhancing the stature and credibility of the IAB within \n21 | P age \n \n\nSCPD and in the community, as well as improving the efficacy and timeliness of its \ninvestigations.  For example, as discussed in our April 2016 report, the IAB has added more and \nhigher-ranking officers to its command structure, and reconstituted the IAB so that it is now \ncomposed of three teams of six investigators, each of which is led by a captain.  In addition to \nthese changes, the IAB has instituted critical incident review teams so that the IAB is involved in \nthe first response to critical incidents such as officer-involved shootings.  Although it remains \ntoo early to determine the long-term effects of this restructuring, it appears that these changes are \nhaving an extremely positive impact on the IAB.  It is clear that the IAB has brought in some \nvery experienced and accomplished investigators; for example, we met and interviewed \ninvestigators who were recently recruited for the IAB from other departments in SCPD and who \nhad extensive experience with both investigating and supervising criminal investigations.  In \naddition, the new command staff in the IAB has expressed to us a serious commitment to \nreducing the backlog of unresolved cases and to improving the timeliness of ongoing \ninvestigations, and it appears that they already are having success in achieving those goals.  We \nnote, for example, that the three most recently closed internal affairs investigations all were \nclosed between five and nine months after receipt of the initial complaint; this is a time line \nwhich can be improved upon but which nonetheless is shorter than that of similar cases handled \nby the Department in the past.  In addition, SCPD command staff reported that, at the time of our \nmost recent site visit in October 2016, they had completed 211 internal affairs investigations for \nthe year to date; this compares to a total of 130 internal affairs investigations completed in 2015, \nand 65 internal affairs investigations completed in 2014.  Moreover, of the 211 internal affairs \ninvestigations SCPD had completed by October 2016, only 26 were investigations that were \nopened in 2016; thus it is apparent that SCPD has been devoting substantial resources to \ncompleting older investigations.  We also heard from both IAB command staff and investigators \nthat they are having more frequent and more substantive communication with one another about \nsupervisory review of investigations.  Moreover, the development of the critical incident review \nteam gives legitimacy to the IAB and better integrates the IAB with the operations of the rest of \nthe department.  Finally, based on our review of recently completed internal affairs \ninvestigations, it does appear that current investigations involve a more thorough review than \nthose in the past.  Overall, we believe that the recent changes in the IAB structure and personnel \nare ones that were needed in IAB and that will continue to improve both the quality and the \ntimeliness of the IAB’s investigations. \n \nNonetheless, SCPD continues to face a significant backlog of unresolved cases, and \ncontinuing to reduce this backlog while keeping up with open investigations and newly received \ncomplaints will remain a significant challenge.  To that end, we would renew our \nrecommendation that IAB develop concrete plans for how to prevent a backlog from developing \nin the future.  As we have in our past Assessment Reports, we recommend, for example, that \nIAB develop interim timelines for the progress of an investigation and institute a way of \nmeasuring their adherence to those timelines.  Similarly, we recommend that the new IAB \ncommand staff develop and implement case management guidelines, for example, to guide \ninvestigating officers in determining how to allocate their time between the investigations they \nare handling.  In addition, as discussed above, we recommend that the IAB develop and \nimplement a method for tracking the progress of their investigations.  Without the development \nand implementation of measures to compile and track such information, we are concerned that \nIAB will not be able to complete and sustain the considerable work it has undertaken in reducing \nthe backlog of its unresolved investigations. \n22 | P age \n \n\n \nIn the next year, we will continue to assess SCPD’s implementation of the Agreement’s \nrequirements relating to the Department’s handling of allegations of police misconduct by, for \nexample, reviewing the case files of internal affairs investigations as these investigations are \nclosed, meeting with IAB command staff and investigators, both during our periodic site visits \nand during conference calls with IAB command staff and SCPD legal counsel, and seeking input \nfrom community representatives, both through community forums held during our site visits and \nthrough more individualized meetings and communications with community representatives and \norganizations throughout the year.  Consistent with our practice during the investigation and our \noversight of the Agreement, we will be joined by and will consult with subject matter experts in \npolice accountability in conducting our site visits and in developing our assessments and \nrecommendations.   \n \nE.     COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \n \nVII. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Maintaining Community Relationships  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Community Liaison Officers \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) \nCompliance \n   d.  Community Response Bureau  Partial Compliance \n   e.  Community Outreach  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial  \n   f.  Social media and notification systems \nCompliance \n \nOver this past reporting period, SCPD, and in particular, its Community Liaison Officers \n(“CLO”), Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) officers, and the command staff \nin its Community Response Bureau (“CRB”), continued to devote substantial time and energy \ninto its community engagement programs.  In particular, we were impressed with the extent to \nwhich Police Commissioner Timothy Sini, Lieutenant Matthew O’Malley, and Sergeant \nKathleen Kenneally participated in community meetings, and we believe that their personal \ninvolvement communicates to the Department and to the community the importance that SCPD \nis assigning to engaging with the community.  We also were impressed with the array of \nactivities that the CLO and COPE officers planned and executed over the summer months, \nincluding expanding its popular soccer and team sports programs for youth, and with the clear \nenergy and personal commitment that these officers bring to their work.  Substantial compliance \nwas maintained in the areas of the Agreement directly relating to these officers’ work.  Finally, \nwe were encouraged to learn that SCPD had organized community forums in response to recent \n23 | P age \n \n\nofficer-involved shootings of African-Americans in cities like Baton Rouge, Louisiana and St. \nPaul, Minnesota, specifically to address questions and concerns from the public about biased \npolicing.   \n \nThese efforts notwithstanding, we continue to have concerns about the effectiveness of \nSCPD’s implementation of the community engagement provisions of the Agreement.  In \nparticular, we recommend that SCPD continue making efforts to better integrate its COPE \nofficers with its CRB and COPE officers, and also to involve all of its officers, and not only \nthose formally involved in community engagement, in community policing.  In addition, we \nrecommend that SCPD make efforts to be more proactive and thoughtful in seeking to engage \nless traditional partners and the more underserved parts of the Suffolk County community in its \ncommunity engagement programs, and also in seeking to address the current informational needs \nand concerns of the community in its outreach efforts.  We describe SCPD’s areas of \nimprovement and our outstanding concerns in more detail below. \n \n1.  Maintaining Community Relationships and Community Outreach \n \nAs we noted above, we recognize Police Commissioner Sini and the leadership of \nSCPD’s CRB, including Lieutenant O’Malley and Sergeant Kenneally, for their stated \ncommitment to making community engagement a priority for SCPD.  We also commend SCPD \nfor making that commitment clear through regularly meeting in person with representatives of \nthe community, including leaders of advocacy groups and service providers working with the \nLatino community in Suffolk County.  It does appear that these meetings are helping to make \nSCPD leadership and the Department, in general, more accessible to the community. \n \nSCPD still needs to think beyond its established community engagement events when \nconceiving of how to adopt a community policing model throughout its Department.  The \nDepartment needs to be more proactive and thoughtful in planning its outreach, both in order to \nreach segments of the community with which it still has not made sufficient inroads and, \nimportantly, to assuage the community’s concerns and provide needed information about current \ncriminal justice issues affecting Suffolk County.  As an example, we were impressed with the \nmanner in which SCPD handled a political campaign rally some months ago; it reflected \nsignificant coordination between different parts of the Department, advance outreach to \ncommunity organizations that SCPD anticipated would be affected by the rally and potential \nprotests, and advance plans to have a heightened officer presence in the area.  By contrast, we \nheard from Latino advocates and individuals in the community that they are extremely fearful \nabout a string of recent abductions and murders of Latina girls, and that this anxiety is \nexacerbated by a lack of clarity or information about SCPD’s policies and practices for taking \nand responding to reports of missing persons.  We would urge SCPD to respond to these \nconcerns by taking proactive steps to reach out to potentially affected communities, and by \ndedicating officer resources to making people feel informed and protected in the wake of these \ncrimes.  Similarly, we would urge SCPD to continue to hold community forums like the ones \nthat it organized in response to the national concerns about officer-involved shootings and racial \nprofiling, either about these issues or about other criminal justice issues that arise and seem \npressing to the communities served by the Department. \n \n24 | P age \n \n\n In addition, SCPD appears to be facing some challenges implementing some of the more \ninnovative ideas that it had proposed to improve its community engagement efforts.  For \nexample, SCPD’s plans for revising and implementing a survey of the community appear to have \nnot yet been implemented.  We urge SCPD to either resolve the financial and logistical disputes \nthat appear to have caused this impasse, or to seek out a reasonable alternative for conducting \nand analyzing such a community survey.  As we have expressed in our past reports, the \ncommunity survey, and analysis of the survey results, should serve as a key data point for SCPD \nin determining how to improve its community engagement programs.   \n \nMoreover, we found that SCPD is still not using its community relations daily activity \nreporting system in a consistent or effective way.  It seemed to us that the officers who are \nintended to use this system to report on their activities did not have the same understanding of \nwhat the current capabilities of the system are as was described to us by CRB leadership; for \nexample, we heard both that a feature for recording community contacts had been developed as a \nmock-up simply for the purpose of showing it to DOJ during our site visit, and then, in a separate \nmeeting with SCPD leadership, that the program was operational and should be being used by all \nCOPE and CLO officers.  Having a consistent and accurate means of tracking officers’ \ncommunity engagement work, and of keeping information on community contacts developed at \nthe precinct and CRB levels, is an essential, but still lacking, component of developing an \neffective community engagement program. \n \n2.  Community Liaison Officers, Community Oriented Policing Enforcement, and the \nCommunity Response Bureau  \n \nAlthough we recognize that CLO and COPE officers are working well together at the \nprecinct level, we continue to think that SCPD would benefit from improving communication \nbetween CLO and COPE officers across different precincts and from having better and more \nregular communication not just between CLO and leadership in CRB, but also COPE and CRB.  \nTo begin with, as we have expressed in past reports, improving communication across precincts \nshould allow them to share with one another useful information about the successes and \nchallenges of their own community engagement programs.  Moreover, based on our interviews \nwith CLO and COPE officers, we have the impression that these officers largely perceive of their \nroles as distinct:  the CLO officers are responsible for implementing the community engagement \nand public relations strategies set by SCPD leadership, while the COPE officers are responsible \nfor attending and participating in the day-to-day activities in their precinct – the list of which is \nlargely unchanging and determined by invitations from local organizations or individuals.  This \nperception is not consistent either with the expressed intention of leadership in the CRB or, we \nbelieve, with effective implementation of a coordinated community engagement program.  We \nrecommend that SCPD, and in particular, the CRB take steps to improve the communication and \ncollaboration of the COPE officers with their leadership in CRB.  For example, COPE officers \nmight be invited to and participate once a month in the weekly meetings between the CLO \nofficers and the CRB.  Similarly, it may be useful to hold quarterly meetings including the CLO \nand COPE officers, the CRB, and the Deputy Police Commissioner, either at SCPD headquarters \nor at locations rotating among the various precincts. \n \nIn addition, we renew our recommendation, expressed in our April 2016 report, that \nSCPD take affirmative steps to involve the entire Department – and not only its COPE and CLO \n25 | P age \n \n\nofficers – in community policing.   It is essential that community engagement be perceived as \nrelevant to, and part of the responsibility of, all police officers and command staff in SCPD—\nand it is the responsibility of SCPD leadership and command staff to take concrete, affirmative \nsteps to get patrol and investigative units involved in community engagement programs.  For \nexample, SCPD should encourage patrol officers to attend community events and make it clear \nthat such activities are an integral part of their law enforcement responsibilities.  While we did \nhear examples of patrol attending community events along with their CLO and COPE colleagues \n– most notably, at one precinct where the precinct commander assigned a rotating list of patrol to \nattend such events – this remains the exception rather than the norm.  Moreover, even having \npatrol officers occasionally attend community events, while welcome, would not reflect the kind \nof culture change that is needed in order for the Department to truly operate with a community \npolicing model.  Instead, community policing should infuse the context of everything that \nofficers do, regardless of whether their job description focuses on patrol, detective work, or \ncommunity engagement.  We were encouraged by Commissioner Sini’s commitment to this \nprinciple during our meetings with him on this site visit, and are hopeful that progress in this area \nwill be made during the next several months.     \n \nTo be clear, we recognize that such culture change can be difficult and slow, and that the \nsteps needed to achieve it may be harder to recognize or to measure than, for example, increasing \nthe number of events that COPE and CLO officers attend or the number of new community \ncontacts that they develop.  We have appreciated the open spirit with which SCPD has taken to \nour suggestions about how to improve its compliance with the Agreement’s community \nengagement provisions, including by participating in periodic conference calls between DOJ and \nrepresentatives of the CRB, and we remain very willing to working cooperatively with the \nDepartment to discuss and strategize about how to continue and improve this work going \nforward.  In addition, we note that the procedural justice training that the Department will be \nreceiving and implementing over the course of the next year (discussed in more detail in the \nsection on Bias-Free Policing) should provide the Department with useful guidance about how to \nincorporate community policing into all of its law enforcement work. \n \nGoing forward, we will continue to meet with representatives of the CRB command staff, \nboth during our site visits to SCPD and during our periodic conference calls with CRB command \nstaff and SCPD legal counsel, to discuss SCPD’s implementation efforts and, to the extent \nappropriate, to give our recommendations and feedback on these efforts.  We also will meet with \nCOPE and CLO officers during our site visits and review documents and information about their \ncommunity meetings and outreach events, both to assess the quantity and quality of the COPE \nand CLO officers’ outreach efforts, to gauge SCPD’s progress in developing a system for \nrecording and tracking such outreach, and to assess the extent to which SCPD is improving the \ncommunication and cooperation between the different officers and command staff involved in \ncommunity outreach.  As has been our practice in the past, we will be joined by and will consult \nwith subject matter experts in community engagement by law enforcement in conducting these \nmeetings and our assessment.  In addition, we will continue to monitor SCPD’s progress in \ndeveloping and implementing a community survey, and expect that this work will include \nreviewing drafts of the survey instrument itself as well as plans for the survey’s implementation, \nand meetings with the individuals involved in the survey’s development and implementation.   \n \n26 | P age \n ",

INTRODUCTION  \n \nIn January 2014, the United States Department of Justice  (DOJ)  and the Suffolk County \nPolice Department (“SCPD”  or the “Department”) entered  into  a Settlement Agreement  \n(“Settlement  Agreement” or “Agreement”)  to ensure that police services are  provided to all  \nmembers of  the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community,  in a manner that  \ncomplies with the Constitution and laws of the United States.1   DOJ, as part of its responsibilities \nfor oversight of  SCPD’s  implementation of the Settlement Agreement, periodically reports on its  \nassessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  This is the ninth Assessment Report, \nwhich addresses SCPD’s efforts from the second half of 2019  through the end of  2021.   The  \nperiod covered by this  report aligns  in large part  with the  COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted \nnearly every facet of American life, including SCPD and DOJ  activities  related to  \nimplementation of  the Settlement Agreement.  \n \nSince we issued  our  last Assessment  Report  in 2019  (the “Eighth Assessment Report”),  \nDOJ  representatives from both the  Civil Rights  Division and the  United States Attorney’s Office \nfor the Eastern District of New  York reviewed documents  and materials  provided by SCPD, \nincluding entries in SCPD’s community relations daily  activity reporting  system,  documentation \nregarding hate crimes and language assistance,  and other reports.  We  met with the  previous  \nCommissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department, Geraldine Hart, to discuss  the progress \nmade to date and the challenges that  remain.   We  met with SCPD officials,  SCPD command staff  \nand other  supervisors, and SCPD officers.   We  met with  members of specialized units, including \nthe Hate Crimes Unit  and the Community Response Bureau.   We also  met with advocates and \nsolicited  the  views of the  Suffolk County community, including the Latino community.  In \nconducting these activities, we consulted with experts in  police practices.  \n \nWe  thank the  SCPD officials with whom we met during this assessment period, and we  \nappreciate  the cooperation and sustained commitment  that SCPD and Suffolk County leadership \ncontinue  to show in addressing the requirements of the Agreement.   We also thank  the many \nmembers of  the Suffolk County community who have met  with us  and provided  us with \ninvaluable feedback.   \n  \nThis Assessment Report is divided into two sections.  First, we provide  a compliance  \nrating for each provision of the  Settlement Agreement.  Second,  we provide a more detailed \nanalysis of  SCPD’s successes and challenges to date in  each  main area of the Agreement:   1)  \nbias-free policing; 2) hate crimes and hate incidents; 3)  language assistance; 4) allegations of  \npolice misconduct; and 5) community engagement.  \n \nII.    SUMMARY OF  CURRENT COMPLIANCE RATINGS  \n \nSection  IX of the Settlement Agreement provides that  the United States will assess and  \nreport on SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  See Agreement at  19-20.  The compliance  \nratings below represent  the United States’ current assessment of SCPD’s compliance with each  \n                                                            \n1   This  Agreement  is  available  in  both  English  and  Spanish  at  https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section-\ncases-and-matters/download#police.   \n2  \n\narea of the  Agreement.  While Section III of this Report provides  a more detailed analysis of  \nSCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, these ratings are included to provide SCPD and the  \nSuffolk County community with a clear and accurate summary of progress to date, as well as \nareas  that  remain most in need of attention.   \n \nThe definition of each rating type is as follows:  \n \n•   “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the Department  has achieved compliance with  \nmost or all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  \n•   “Partial Compliance” indicates that the Department  has achieved compliance on some of  \nthe components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work \nremains.     \n \nSettlement Agreement Area   Status of Compliance   \nIII.

POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY   Substantial  Compliance  \n \nAs this table demonstrates, SCPD has reached substantial  compliance with nearly all  \nprovisions of the Settlement Agreement.  We summarize here the specific steps that  would lead \nSCPD to  achieve  substantial compliance with  the areas that remain in partial compliance. Those  \nsteps are:   \n \n•   Traffic-Stop Data: SCPD  must ensure and demonstrate that traffic-stop  data is captured  \nand preserved in a transparent  and reliable manner.  We recommend that SCPD conduct  \nadditional quality-assurance checks on the data that its vendor  relied upon to address  \napparently duplicated records.  If it  identifies errors or discrepancies in the dataset, we \nrecommend that SCPD’s vendor re-run its analysis on a dataset that is accurate and  \nreliable.  Alternatively, SCPD could conduct a new analysis  with more updated data that  \nit subjects to rigorous quality-assurance processes to ensure its accuracy and reliability.   \nOnce SCPD  has completed a study of its traffic stop data based on accurate and reliable \ndatasets, it  must evaluate whether  the study  suggests that changes are necessary  to  \naddress any  disparities that may exist.  \n•   Policies Related to Language Access: To ensure that  the language-access policies \nrequired by the Agreement are meaningfully guiding its day-to-day operations, SCPD  \nshould audit  officer response to  calls  in which 911 operators indicate language assistance \nis  required and  SCPD officers, who were  the primary responders, nonetheless  \ndocumented that  the individual “spoke sufficient  English.”  Such an audit should evaluate  \nwhether officers are failing to provide appropriate language-access services. In addition,  \nSCPD  must take appropriate  action in response  to problems that it learns  about through \n4  \n\n“Quality of  Service” contacts with 911 callers  who have Limited English Proficiency \n(LEP).  \n•   Spanish-Language Access to SCPD Website: SCPD  must translate forms that it makes  \navailable on its website  into languages other  than English and  make those  forms  as  \nreadily available  as  the English versions.  SCPD  should also ensure that  the most recent  \nversions  of forms  are  available in languages other than English, and consider  dating  all  \ntranslated documents.  SCPD  must ensure that  the current version of the Language  \nAccess Plan  is translated  into  languages other  than English and Spanish that are  \nfrequently spoken by LEP individuals in Suffolk County, including Chinese, Haitian \nCreole, Polish, Italian, and Portuguese.  \nWe look forward to working with SCPD  so it can successfully  implement these steps.   \n   \n5  \n\nIII.  ANALYSIS OF SCPD’S COMPLIANCE TO DATE       \n  \nIII. BIAS-FREE POLICING  \n   a.  Policies and Procedures   Substantial Compliance  \n   b.  Traffic-Stop Data   Partial Compliance  \n   c.  Training   Substantial  Compliance  \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD has committed to ensure  that its police services are \n“equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that promotes broad community \nengagement and confidence in the Department” and  that all “members of the public  receive equal  \nprotection of the law, without bias based on race, color, ethnicity,  national origin, religion, or  \nsexual orientation, and in accordance with the  rights, privileges, and immunities secured or  \nprotected by the Constitution and  laws of the United States.”   Agreement III(a) at 4.    \n \nThe Department continues to be  in substantial compliance with the policies and  \nprocedures, and the training provisions of the Agreement.  But it  remains in partial compliance \nwith  the  provisions of the Agreement related  to the collection and analysis of data related to  \ntraffic stops.   SCPD  will  achieve substantial compliance once it  demonstrates  that  it is  able to \nappropriately manage,  analyze, and respond to  the data it  is  collecting.   \n   \na.   Policies and Procedures  \n \nWe previously rated SCPD in substantial compliance with the  policies and procedures \nprovisions of the Agreement.  See  Sixth Assessment Report at 6; see also  Agreement III(a) - (b) \nat 4-5.  As we  have  noted before, ensuring that  SCPD members  adhere  to  these policies in  \npractice will  be an ongoing endeavor, accomplished in part  through appropriate data collection  \nand analyses, which continues to be a work in progress for the Department, as discussed below.  \n  \nb.   Traffic-Stop Data  \n \nSo that the department can better ensure bias-free policing, the Agreement  requires  SCPD \nto collect accurate traffic-stop data,  analyze  it for indications of bias, and explain  any  measures it  \nwill take in response to that analysis.  See Agreement III(c) at 6.   SCPD has  taken significant \nsteps towards compliance in this area.   See  Seventh Assessment Report at  6-8  and Eighth \nAssessment Report at 6-7.   \n  \nDuring this assessment period, SCPD retained the services of the Finn Institute (Finn),  \nwhich analyzed the data  from March 5, 2018 to March 4, 2019 and produced a report in \nSeptember 2020. See https://perma.cc/PVA4-9ZLH. Finn  concluded that SCPD’s data did not  \nsupport an inference of bias against  Black or Hispanic drivers with regard to officers’ decisions  \nto initiate stops.  However, Finn’s  analysis found that  the data  did indicate bias in SCPD’s post-\nstop activities.  The data that Finn  analyzed showed that SCPD officers searched Black  and \nHispanic drivers, their vehicles, and  passengers at rates higher than  those of their white \n6  \n\ncounterparts.  Further, SCPD’s searches of Black and Hispanic people were less  likely to yield \nany contraband than searches of white subjects.  SCPD has related  several  measures it  says it has \ntaken since our  visit  to address  these concerns, including the elimination of  consent  searches  \nduring traffic stops absent a founded suspicion that the person is involved in criminal activity, as \nwell as  efforts to improve the  collection, analysis,  and publication of  traffic  stop data.  We look \nforward to reviewing and assessing these changes during our  next  visit.  \n \nUnited for Justice in Policing Long Island (“UJPLI”) published an analysis that  \nhighlighted the apparent  insertion or  alteration of 112,000 duplicate records for stops in 2017 and \n2018. A  majority of these duplicate  records involved stops of white people, which UJPLI  \nalleged had  a mitigating  effect on the racial disparities  identified in Finn’s review.  See  \nhttps://www.ujpli.org/li-law-enforcement.  DOJ’s independent analysis of the data available on \nSCPD’s website  confirmed evidence consistent  with the duplicate records identified by UJPLI.  \nAs a result,  we have concerns about  whether Finn’s analysis may have understated  racial  \ndisparities in SCPD’s traffic stop activities.   \n \nSCPD has taken  steps to  address issues with its traffic stop data.   At the  time of our \neighth  assessment,  in 2019, SCPD had  transitioned  to a new  data system  that was developed and \nmaintained by its  information technology unit.  This system  gave SCPD  greater  control over  its  \ndata collection  than the  previous system.  The system  improved  SCPD’s analysis of traffic-stop \ndata  relevant  to bias-free policing practices.   Throughout the system’s development,  SCPD and  \nDOJ worked together to address  issues that could impact the quality of the data and its analysis.   \nAlthough these developments reflect progress, the Department must address concerns raised  \nabout the data used in Finn’s analysis.     \n \nIn order to gain  substantial compliance  with the traffic-stop data provisions of  the  \nAgreement, SCPD must ensure and demonstrate that data is captured and preserved in a  \ntransparent and reliable manner.   We recommend that  SCPD conduct additional quality  \nassurance checks on the data that  Finn relied upon to address the apparently duplicated \nrecords.  If  it identifies errors or discrepancies in the dataset, we recommend that Finn re-\nrun its analysis on a dataset that is accurate and reliable.  Alternatively, SCPD could  \nconduct a new analysis with more updated data that it subjects  to rigorous quality  \nassurance processes  to  ensure its accuracy and reliability.   SCPD informs us that it will be  \naddressing these concerns in 2023.  We look forward to reviewing its  efforts  during our next  \nvisit.     \n \nIn furtherance of its compliance efforts and to help rebuild community confidence, we  \nalso  recommend, as a matter of technical  assistance,  that SCPD work  with stakeholders  to  ensure \nthat  its analyses of traffic stop data satisfy not only its direct law enforcement needs, but also is \nresponsive to the concerns of  community stakeholders. We will continue to monitor SCPD’s data  \nmanagement and transparency practices to ensure they are meeting  the intent of the Agreement.   \n \nOnce SCPD  has a study  of its traffic stop  data based on accurate and  reliable datasets, the  \nAgreement requires SCPD to explain what steps  it will take,  if any,  to address the findings of the  \nstudy: “SCPD will provide to the United States a report  analyzing the collected  traffic stop data \nand explaining what measures, if any, SCPD will take as a result of  the analysis.”   Agreement  ¶  \n7  \n\nIII(c.)(ii.) at 6  (emphasis added).  The Finn study did not include this kind of explanation, and \nSCPD did not otherwise convey an explanation to DOJ.  Once SCPD has completed a study of  \nits traffic stop data based on accurate and reliable datasets, they must, in order to come \ninto substantial compliance with the traffic-stop data provisions of  the agreement,  evaluate  \nwhether the study suggests that changes are necessary  to  address any disparities identified  \nin its data.  SCPD may consider  reviewing its policies  and  practices related to traffic stops to  \ndetermine whether  different approaches to traffic enforcement  may impact  any  disparities  \nidentified.   SCPD  could also further  analyze  its data to  identify  the particular precincts, units, or  \nofficers who may be engaging in biased activities, and address any issues it identifies.   \n \nc.   Training  \n \nThe  Agreement requires  that all sworn officers receive  training on bias-free policing at  \nleast annually.  See Agreement at 6-7.  This  training is to “emphasize that discriminatory  \npolicing, in the form of either selective enforcement or non-enforcement  of the  law, including the  \nselecting or rejecting of  particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited by policy  and will \nsubject officers to disciplinary action.”   Id.  The Agreement also sets forth specific elements that  \nSCPD must  incorporate  into its  bias-free training.   Id.    \n \nWe found SCPD in substantial compliance with this requirement in our  seventh \nassessment report,  when we determined that  SCPD’s  training was  sufficiently  thorough and \nclear, providing officers  with  the necessary  understanding of  the psychological  and situational  \nfactors that  can result  in bias influencing law enforcement outcomes, and the techniques that  \nofficers should use to prevent this from happening.  Due to the pandemic’s limitations on travel \nand in-person interactions, we  were unable to observe SPCD’s training for this  report.  However, \nSCPD  has  continued to provide  relevant  training despite the  limitations  of the pandemic.  SCPD \nhad trained a total of 2,325 officers  by the end of  2021—791 in 2018, 680 in 2018, 552 in 2020,  \nand 292  in 2021.   SCPD  has scheduled seven additional classes for  2022.  Based on our prior \nsatisfaction with the quality and content of the training and SCPD’s continued progress toward \ntraining all officers, we have determined  that SCPD has reached substantial compliance with this  \nrequirement of the Settlement Agreement.  \n  \nIV. HATE  CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS  \n   a.  Training   Substantial  Compliance  \n   b. Tracking and Reporting   Substantial  Compliance  \n   c.  Quality Assurance   Substantial Compliance  \n \nWe previously found SCPD  to be  in substantial compliance  with the hate crimes portions  \nof the Agreement.  See  Seventh Report at  8, Eighth  Report at 7.  We continue to find SCPD in \nsubstantial compliance.   To ensure that SCPD’s compliance is durable,  and as  a matter or  \ntechnical assistance, we make several recommendations below for  continued focus and \nrefinement  this this area.   \n \n8  \n\na.   Training  \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD  must ensure that all officers receive annual  hate crimes and  \nhate incident training.   See Agreement  ¶  IV(a) at 7.   We found SCPD to be in substantial  \ncompliance with this  provision of  the Agreement in October 2016.  See  Fourth Assessment  \nReport at 9-10.  Despite the challenges  imposed by pandemic,  the Department continues to \ndeliver the  approved training and remains  in substantial  compliance.   \n \nb.   Tracking, Reporting, and Pattern Analyses  \n \nIn our last report, we described how  SCPD addressed a deficiency in an electronic form  \nused to identify and track potential hate crimes and incidents.  Under SCPD policy, a  hate crime  \nis the commission of a specific crime where the suspect  intentionally selected  the victim because \nof their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, \nor sexual orientation.  A hate incident is a broader category that would include any incident of  \nhate or bias,  regardless of whether a crime occurred.   In  the electronic form that SCPD uses to  \ndocument hate crimes and incidents, if the Hate  Crimes Unit (HCU) determined that a report of a  \npossible hate crime was in fact only  a hate incident  and unchecked the hate crime checkbox  on \nthe electronic form, SCPD’s  system would automatically uncheck the hate crime  motivation box \non the form  as well.  As  a result, SCPD’s system would not track the incident for inclusion in \nsummary reports regarding hate incidents that were originally marked as possible hate crimes.   \nSCPD has  successfully  resolved this  issue  so that its data and summary reports will be  more  \naccurate.  SCPD  is  therefore  in substantial compliance with the hate crimes tracking, reporting, \nand pattern analysis provisions of the Agreement.  \n \nc.   Quality Assurance  \n \nThe Agreement requires  SCPD to “implement a  policy describing its HCU quality \nassurance process that ensures that HCU investigations follow proper techniques and  \nprocedures.”  The Agreement also requires SCPD to  conduct random audits of HCU  \ninvestigations and any corrective actions taken because of the audits.   See  Agreement  ¶  IV(c) at  \n7-8.  SCPD  remains in  substantial compliance with  these requirements.    \nNotwithstanding SCPD’s continuing compliance in this  area, we note that SCPD reported \ndeclining hate crime rates at the same time that the rate of hate crimes increased  across the State \nof New  York and in much of the rest of the country.  We recommend, as a matter of technical  \nassistance,  that SCPD analyze this discrepancy to determine what may account for it,  as it  is \nunclear why Suffolk County would be an outlier from other parts of the  state or country.  We  \nalso note that this discrepancy has reinforced existing skepticism  of SCPD’s  hate-crime reporting  \npractices among members of the public who believe that, as in other parts  of the state and \ncountry, the  rate of hate  crimes increased in Suffolk County at the  same time that SCPD reported \na decrease.   We encourage SCPD to  work with community stakeholders and  re-evaluate its \npractices regarding  hate crimes and incidents.   We will continue to monitor developments in this  \narea.  \n \nV.LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE  \n9  \n\n   a.  Policies  Related to Language Access   Partial Compliance  \n   b. Language  Line Order   Substantial Compliance  \n   c.  Policy on Persons  with Limited English Proficiency   Substantial Compliance  \n   d.  Spanish-Language  Access to SCPD  Website   Partial Compliance  \n   e.  Incentives for Interpreters   Substantial  Compliance  \n   f.  Consultation with the Latino Community   Substantial  Compliance  \n   g.  Language Assistance Training   Substantial Compliance  \n   h. Community Survey   Substantial  Compliance  \n  \nThe  Agreement requires  SCPD to develop and implement  language-access  policies and \npractices so that  persons who  have  Limited English Proficiency (LEP) have meaningful access to \npolice services.   See Agreement ¶ V at 8-11.    \n \nAs we have noted in past reports,  SCPD has developed excellent  language-access policies \nand departmental protocols.    SCPD  policies are  aimed at increasing  its employees’  ability to  \nunderstand and respond to all LEP individuals, whether witnesses, suspects,  or members of the  \npublic generally.  However, SCPD still has work to  do to  achieve successful implementation of  \nthose policies.   While SCPD’s 2021 Language Assistance Report notes that the department “has \nmade significant progress over the  last 6 years in providing competent and consistent  language  \nassistance,” the Department  needs  to be vigilant about  monitoring and course-correction  to \nensure that there is full departmental implementation of the  Language Access Plan  (LAP)  and \nlanguage-access  training content, and that  LEP community members are  routinely experiencing \nthe intended outcomes of the  language-access  reforms.  This area  continues to  require more  \ndiligent efforts to  achieve substantial compliance.  \n \na.   Policies Related to Language Access   \nb.   Language Line Order  \nc.   Policy on Persons with Limited English Proficiency  \n  \nSubparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of the Language  Assistance section of the Agreement all  \nrequire SCPD to adopt policies that ensure adequate language access for LEP individuals who \nhave encounters with the police.  We evaluated these policies  to ensure that  they comport with \nthe requirements of the  Agreement.  As described in subsection 1, below, the policies  themselves  \ncomply with the Agreement.  We also evaluated SCPD’s implementation of these policies, to \nensure that  the policies  meaningfully guided SCPD  in its day-to-day operations. For  the reasons  \nset forth in subsection 2, below, SCPD  must take  additional steps to fully implement its  \nlanguage-access policies and bring its operations  into compliance with the Agreement.  \n \n1.   Evaluation of SCPD Policies   \n10  \n\n \nAs  we noted above, SCPD’s  language-access  policies continue to comply  with the  \nrequirements of the Settlement Agreement.  SCPD has further strengthened those policies in  \nresponse  to guidance we previously provided.  For example, SCPD has now included in its LAP  \nrequirements:  \n \n●   a precinct-level audit procedure of all services  rendered to 911 callers based upon \nquarterly LIMA Reports  (which provide data regarding the use of  language-\naccess  services in the field after  interpretation was needed during the 911 call.  \nSuch calls are referred to as “LIMA” calls.);  \n●   strict prohibition of using children as interpreters  unless no other option is  \navailable and only in emergency situations;  and  \n●   a requirement that statements taken from LEP individuals are read back to the  \nindividual in their primary language.  \n \nIf properly implemented, these changes will further strengthen the Department’s \ncommunications with LEP individuals.   \n \nWe reviewed the Language Access Department Memo 19-87, DMEM 18-96 (Language  \nAccess Tracking Database), DTE 15-03 (Online  Tracking of  Language Assistance), DMEM  20-\n01 (Quarterly Lima Report Review), PDMEM 19-01 Language Line Quality of Service Audits, \nAffidavit of Translation directive, and PDCS 3111 (Affidavit of Translation form). All of these  \ncommunications match the required  protocols and practices delineated  in the  LAP.  \n \nWe also reviewed the Language Access Plan Memo Book Entry 18-01 (PDCS  7045), a  \ndocument that summarizes the LAP for SCPD employees.  It is a good practice to provide  \nofficers with a summary of the key points of the  LAP in their  memo books.   This document, \nhowever,  is  six pages  long and too wordy to be  useful to an officer on patrol.  As a matter of  \ntechnical assistance, we recommend that SCPD boil down this document to the main points of  \nthe LAP.  SCPD should also consider providing officers with  the flow chart used  in training  that \nsummarizes the process for using  language-access  services.  (We note that SCPD still  needs to  \nupdate this flow chart to  reflect the requirement from its policy that children should not be used \nas interpreters.)  We recommend that SCPD keep this insert  to  two pages  in length to  ensure that \nofficers can  use it  efficiently and effectively.   \n \nSCPD recently informed us that  the  LAP Memo Book insert  has been discontinued,  along \nwith the  rest of the  hard-copy memo book.  SCPD has  replaced  the hard-copy book  with an \nelectronic version  that includes  the  LAP information on a  single page of text, with a  second page  \nshowing a flow chart.  We look forward to reviewing those  changes during our next  visit.  \n \n2.   Evaluation of SCPD’s  Implementation of Policies   \n \nAs noted above, SCPD  must continue working toward Department-wide implementation  \nof its policies related to language-access services.  The Agreement requires SCPD to “provide  \nmeaningful  access to police services” to LEP  individuals.   Agreement ¶ V(a)(i)  at 8.  We  \ncommend the Department for  the steps it has  taken to fulfill this requirement.  SCPD  has \n11  \n\ndedicated  substantial  resources to making it  easier for officers to use language services, including  \nthe  installation of tablets in every patrol car  loaded  with  the  Language Line  app.  SCPD has  \nsignificantly  increased  the number of  certified bilingual officers and Department Authorized \nInterpreters.   SCPD also has made progress in ensuring that  the Department monitors language  \naccess among patrol officers and supervisors.   Further, SCPD’s data shows incremental  \nimprovement  in officers’ provision of  language-access  services.  The percentage of LIMA calls \nwhere officers provided no language-access  services because the officer believed  the individual  \n“spoke sufficient English” declined from  more than 50 percent of LIMA calls in 2016 to under  \n20 percent in 2020.   \n \nStill, issues remain.  The reduction in LIMA calls where officers documented that the \nindividual “spoke  sufficient English,” for example, was due in large part to SCPD eliminating  \nfrom its analysis “aided calls” where the Department was not  the primary responder.   SCPD has  \nnot, as far as we are aware, analyzed the remaining 20% of LIMA calls in  which SCPD was the \nprimary responder and the officer documented that the person “spoke sufficient English.”   To  \ncome into  substantial compliance  with the Agreement, SCPD  should  audit  officer responses \nto LIMA calls during which SCPD  is the primary responder and the officer documents that  \nthe individual “spoke  sufficient English.”   SCPD  should design this audit to  assess whether  \npatrol officers  may simply be  muddling through conversations  with LEP individuals  without an \ninterpreter.   Video from  officers’ body cameras may be useful for  such an audit.  SCPD recently  \ninformed us  that  IAB will be reviewing  footage from body worn cameras  in addition to IAB’s  \nother quality assurance audits.  We look forward to reviewing this change during our next visit.  \nEven if  an  officer  believes that they  are able to  understand  the statements of  an  LEP individual  \nand resultingly  documents  that the  individual “spoke sufficient English,”  there is no  assurance \nthat the LEP individual actually understood  what  the officer told them.  The individual may not  \nhave been able to  effectively communicate questions or concerns.    \n \nSCPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau reviews language-access  services by making  “Quality of \nService” contacts with  LEP 911 callers.   Although we commend the Department for proactively \nreaching out to LEP individuals  to gather  information about their experiences with the  police,  \nSCPD reports that these  reviews demonstrate  minimal  improvement in the provision of  \nlanguage-access  services.  Many of the  911 callers  reached through Quality of Service  contacts  \nsay that officers did not  provide  interpretation services  and were unable to communicate  \neffectively.   In order to  come into  substantial compliance  with the Agreement, the  \nDepartment  must take appropriate action in response to what it is learning through these  \nQuality of Service  contacts  and develop more  expansive audit tools  to evaluate officer  \ncompliance.   Expanding these  contacts  and conducting effective audits will allow SCPD  to \nobtain more and better data on the provision of language-access services.  SCPD  must also act on \nany allegations that  it  receives that officers violated policies related to language access and,  \nwhere SCPD determines that officers violated policy,  take appropriate corrective  action.   \n \nAs noted above, SCPD  added a provision to the LAP prohibiting use of children as  \ninterpreters, absent an emergency.  But, as with  the Quality  of Service contacts,  advocates \nreported incidents  even after issuance of the policy where officers have used children  as \ninterpreters in  non-emergency situations.   Advocates also said  that, as in the past, officers at  \ntimes direct  conversations during domestic violence calls involving an LEP and an  English \n12  \n\nproficient partner to  the person  who is proficient  in English.  We recommend, as a matter of  \ntechnical assistance,  that the  Department evaluate  and address  these issues, perhaps as part of the \naudit of LIMA calls, or through the  Quality of Service contacts.  \n \nWe also note that  officers may  at times  be  underreporting  their use of the  Language Line.  \nWhen we compared documentation from Language Line Services  to officer reports, we learned \nthat as many as two-thirds of the time that the  Language  Line provided interpretation, officers  \ndid not  report its use.  In other words, officers were actually doing the  right thing, but not  \nreporting  it.  SCPD  must examine and rectify this discrepancy.      \n \nIAB also conducts monthly “desk audits”  in which it calls precincts’ front  desks to gauge  \ntheir responses to LEP individuals.  These audits—consistent with the experiences of community  \nmembers and advocates—indicate that Suffolk officers at the precinct front desks are  not  \nconsistently providing appropriate, courteous service to LEP individuals.  Further, community \nstakeholders told us that  in the Third Precinct, which serves a  predominantly Spanish-speaking \ncommunity, has turned away individuals because language assistance was not available.  It is  \nunclear why this would be, since  each precinct is  supposed to have a Language Line  dual  \ntelephone available at the front desk.  To address this problem, we recommend, as a matter of  \ntechnical assistance,  that  SCPD continue to assign bilingual personnel  to all precinct front desks  \nwherever possible.     \n \nIn addition to  addressing  patrol officers’ use of language services, we recommend, as a \nmatter of technical  assistance, that  SCPD also  monitor  and assess the use of  language-access  \nservices among SCPD detectives.   While we understand  that detectives are more likely to  \nprovide  language-access  services to ensure the  success of their investigations, SCPD  does not  \ncollect data to show the type or frequency of  language-access  services that detectives may be \nproviding.  SCPD does  not require detectives  to document  instances  in which they provide  \nlanguage-access  services, and neither supervisors nor IAB monitor  the  language-access  services \nthat detectives  may  provide.  \n \nFinally, we recommend,  as a matter of technical assistance,  that  SCPD consider how it  \ncan  incorporate language access  into the implementation of new programs. For example, SCPD  \nlaunched a pilot program focusing on police  encounters with people who may have  mental health \ndisabilities.  SCPD told us that officers in this pilot have not  encountered individuals  with mental  \nhealth disabilities who are also LEP.   It seems unlikely that this trend will continue.   We  \ntherefore  recommend that SCPD consider how it could build language-access  services into  this \nprogram, as well as other programs that they may develop in the future.  \n \nFinally, we recommend,  as a matter of technical assistance,  that SCPD create summary  \nreports of all of its monitoring activities and actions that it takes to enhance  language-access  \nservices, and that it provide these reports to  advocates and the  public at large, to demonstrate  \nSCPD’s commitment to language access.     \n \n \nd.   Spanish Language Access to the SCPD  Website  \n \n13  \n\nSCPD recently revamped its entire website.   We applaud SCPD  for publishing and \nhighlighting relevant data on its  Transparency Hub, creating Spanish language recruitment  \nvideos, providing information about  neighborhood watch organizations  in Spanish.  We are \npleased that  the  Department  has translated  hate crimes notices into a number of Asian languages, \nincluding Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Tagalog, Hindi, and Urdu.   \n \nStill, work remains to be done.  The most notable problem with the website is  that, \nalthough  SCPD has translated  the pages of the new website into Spanish, and a Spanish icon \nappears  clearly on the homepage, most documents and reports  available on the website  are still  \nonly in English, particularly those in PDF format.  Accordingly, even when working from the  \nSpanish language homepage, forms  (e.g., application for a gun permit) are only in English.  To  \ncome into  substantial compliance  with the Agreement, SCPD must translate  forms into  \nlanguages other than English and make  those  forms  as readily available  as  the English \nversions.  SCPD should also ensure that  the most recent versions of  forms are available in  \nlanguages other than English, and consider dating  all translated documents.  The LAP in  \nlanguages other than Spanish and English is an outdated version from 2015.  SCPD must  \nensure that  the current  version of  the LAP  is translated  into  languages  other than English \nand Spanish that are  frequently spoken by LEP individuals in Suffolk County, including  \nChinese, Haitian Creole, Polish, Italian, and Portuguese.  \n \nWe also  recommend, as a matter of technical assistance,  that SCPD translate press \nreleases  into Spanish, and other common languages as appropriate.   We also recommend that  \nSCPD translate its  website’s pages into common languages other than English and Spanish.   The  \nwebsite only  offers translation  into other languages  through Google Translate, which is not  \naccurate or  reliable as the sole source for translation.  \n \ne.   Incentives for Interpreters   \n \nWe have seen a steady  increase in the number of certified bilingual officers and  \nDepartment Authorized  Interpreters (DAIs).  We understand that testing and preparation courses  \nwere delayed due to COVID-19, but that  these will pick up again in the near future.  The  \nDepartment should continue to recruit officers who speak languages  other than  English and \nSpanish.  SCPD told us  that its  personnel speak, among other languages, Mandarin, Korean, \nHindi,  and Haitian Kreyol/Creole.  These are valuable  and important  skills to have to better serve  \nthe ever-changing population of Suffolk County.  \n \nWe recommend, as a matter of technical assistance, that SCPD consider  what steps it can  \ntake to better inform  the community about its efforts  regarding bilingual officers.  Community \nmembers we spoke with told us they believed that officers are becoming certified without any \ntesting.   \n   \n14  \n\n  \nf.   Consultation with the Latino Community  \n \nThe Agreement requires that  the Department consult with  representatives of the Latino  \ncommunity regarding  language-access  issues.  While  the Department has  been engaged in these  \nefforts, there appears  to have been limited contact  during the pandemic.  We hope that, going \nforward, the Department will step up its consultations with the community once again.  As a \nmatter of technical  assistance, we also endorse the recommendation we received from  a number  \nof individuals we spoke  with—both within and outside  the Department—that the  Latino \nOutreach Liaison should be full-time and that  the position should continue reporting to the  \nCommissioner.  At present, the  current liaison’s  ability to perform her duties is limited by her \npart-time work schedule.  Making the position full-time, and having this  person report directly to \nthe Commissioner, will  not only demonstrate  that community outreach is a Department priority,  \nbut it will also ensure that agency  leadership  is kept abreast of what is going well and  what must  \nbe improved.  \n \nWe commend the leadership of the Third Precinct for holding dedicated Spanish-\nlanguage community meetings  and establishing a Hispanic Advisory Board.  This is  a positive  \ndevelopment and we recommend, as a matter of technical assistance,  that  SCPD expand the  \nAdvisory Boards to the  First, Second, Fifth, and Sixth precincts, which all have  large populations  \nof Spanish-speaking community members.   SCPD informs us that it is in the final stages of  \ndeveloping a “Precinct  Level Advisory Board”  program to provide a precinct-level consultation  \non community issues.  We look forward to reviewing this program during our next visit.    \n \ng.   Language Assistance Training    \n \nSCPD continued providing training to officers on language access and remains in \nsubstantial compliance  with this  provision of the Agreement.  We note that  many members of the  \nDepartment  have attended  the  language-access  training multiple times.   We therefore \nrecommend, as a matter  of technical  assistance,  that SCPD  assess officers’  mastery of the \nmaterial.   SCPD should consider  administering  a short assessment a few  weeks after the training \nto determine  whether participants  retained the content and what topics SCPD should reinforce  in \nfuture trainings.  \n \nWe commend SCPD  for making investments in enhancing officers’ language skills.  In  \nApril  2019, the  Department partnered with Stony Brook University’s Department of Professional  \nDevelopment to offer a test preparation course for personnel seeking to become certified as a \nDAI.  In addition, the  Department offered a “Spanish for Law Enforcement” class to  employees  \nwho wished to learn or enhance their Spanish skills.  This was a six-week class, taught  by  a \nSuffolk County Community College Spanish professor.   SCPD  offered  the class  to officers from \nvarious  parts of the Department.  The class met at SCPD  headquarters and was live-streamed to  \nthe individual Precincts  via the Department’s video education system.  \n \nh.   Community Survey  \n \n15  \n\nIn April 2021, the Department issued a report of its most recent satisfaction survey of the  \ncommunity, aimed at helping the Department assess the adequacy of its language-access  \nservices.  The report of the survey is available on  SCPD’s website.  SCPD has achieved  \nsubstantial compliance  with this  provision of the Agreement.  \n \nVI. ALLEGATIONS  OF POLICE  MISCONDUCT  \n   a.  Reporting Misconduct   Substantial  Compliance  \n   b. Investigation of Misconduct   Substantial Compliance  \n \nUnder the police misconduct requirements of the Agreement, SCPD  must have a policy \nthat requires all members to report allegations of discriminatory policing,  ensures  that all \ncomplaints are investigated, and allows third  persons to submit complaints on behalf of victims.  \nAgreement  ¶  V(a) at 11.  The Agreement also includes various provisions concerning the  \ninvestigation of  misconduct, which are aimed at ensuring that  SCPD thoroughly investigates  all \ncomplaints.  See Agreement  ¶  V(b) at  11-12.  The Department attained substantial  compliance  \nwith this  section of the Agreement in our Seventh Assessment Report in October 2018 and \nremains in substantial  compliance for this Assessment.    \n \nAs discussed  in our previous report  and the community engagement section below,  we  \nrecommend, as a matter  of technical  assistance,  that  IAB continue working to build trust and \nsupport  among  members of the community while they investigate  complaints.   One way that  \nSCPD can build trust  is  by completing misconduct investigations  in a timely and thorough \nmanner.  \n \n \nVII. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  \n   a.  Maintaining Community Relationships   Substantial  Compliance  \n   b.  Community Liaison Officers   Substantial Compliance  \n   c.  Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”)   Substantial Compliance  \n   d. Community Response Bureau   Substantial Compliance  \n   e.  Community Outreach   Substantial  Compliance  \n   f.   Social Media and Notification Systems   Substantial Compliance  \n \nSCPD has achieved  substantial  compliance with its Community Engagement obligations  \nunder the Agreement.  SCPD has continued improving its  community engagement efforts despite  \nlimitations  imposed by the pandemic.  Individuals assigned to community engagement at \nheadquarters and in the precincts continue working on communication between the Department  \n16  \n\nand the community.  SCPD holds periodic meetings at the precinct and county levels.  SCPD is  \nincorporating patrol officers into its  engagement efforts.  We remain impressed with SCPD’s \nCommunity Liaison Officers (CLO),  Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (COPE) \nofficers, and the command staff in SCPD’s Community Response Bureau (CRB).   We address all  \nof the  subparagraphs  of the Community Engagement section of the Agreement below.   \n \nSCPD’s community engagement tracking system is operational. The CLO and COPE  \nofficers continue to organize and participate  in a  wide variety of activities.  The Department  \nand its  individual precincts continue  engaging in a number of community outreach events  and \neven found new ways  to engage with community members  during the pandemic.    \n \nIn our previous assessment, we noted that SCPD was developing an effective system for  \ntracking and  analyzing  community outreach events, and that  until that system  was completed  \nand implemented, SCPD could not  demonstrate that officers were regularly conducting and \nrecording community outreach efforts.  Prior to  our virtual site visit in  2021, the Department  \nhad implemented a new  community activity statistic in its system to  track  officers’  interactions  \nwith  the community.  SCPD plans to include  this data about  community engagement  with other \nmeasures of  policing activity, like arrests and  tickets, in  its evaluations of  officers’  \nperformance.  At the time of our tour, SCPD reported that although it had implemented the  \nability to track community engagement, the Department still needed to  conduct  an \ninformational campaign to ensure  that  officers were aware of the change.   We believe this  \napproach has the potential to help improve SCPD  officers’  approach to community engagement  \nand look forward to seeing its effects in future reviews.   In addition, we note that the  tracking \nsystem  treats all  interactions the same, whether  it is an officer’s one-on-one encounter  with a  \ncommunity member or a large-scale  community event involving hundreds of community \nmembers.   We recommend, as a matter of technical assistance, that SCPD consider  ways to  \ntrack community engagement with greater precision.  \n \nSCPD also responded to the recommendation in our last report that it  attempt to  \nbroaden its  community engagement  efforts beyond structured events  to foster community \npartnerships.  We suggested finding new and less  formal ways of building connections, with \nthe goal of  creating an environment where members of the community feel and see evidence  \nthat  their needs are heard and addressed by SCPD.  As a result, SCPD came up  with  new  \nforms of outreach, including iPad giveaways, contactless food distributions, helping \nimmigrants obtain legal  identification, and various non-traditional interactions with youth,  \nincluding activities focused on youth’s career  interests, and outdoor activities during the  \npandemic like hiking and fishing.  \n \nAs noted above,  SCPD  developed and implemented a community survey, as required by \nparagraph VII.d.3 of the  Agreement.  The Finn Instituted  conducted the survey and  produced a  \nreport in April 2021.   The survey queried residents in several  areas,  including perceptions of  \nsafety and crime in their  neighborhood, police legitimacy,  effectiveness and response to  \ncommunity concerns, bias,  and police accountability.  The survey  showed that many \ncommunity members have  positive views of SCPD.   But  the results were  not universally  \npositive.  The survey revealed  a significant  concern in the community pertaining to  bias in  \nSCPD’s interactions with Black and Latino residents.  We encourage SCPD, and CRB in \n17  \n\nparticular, to  work to address  these concerns  in future community engagement strategies, \nconsistent with paragraph VII.d.4 of the Agreement.  \n \nSCPD continues to maintain  substantial compliance with the  provisions of the  \nAgreement relating to the responsibilities of the  CLO and COPE officers.  We encourage \nSCPD to continue building upon this foundation, expanding outreach opportunities, and \nimproving relations with the Latino community.   \n \nOverall, we commend SCPD  for  its  outreach efforts with  the Latino community.   SCPD \nhas made tremendous changes in the  past five years.  But, while  SCPD has achieved  \nsubstantial compliance with  the Community Engagement  section  of  the Agreement, it must \nremain diligent in its community outreach and engagement efforts to maintain this status.  The  \nDepartment must  ensure  that  it maintains current  relationships and build new ones with \ncommunity  stakeholders, especially in the Latino community, and that outreach efforts  involve  \nongoing dialogues with community members.  \n \nVII. POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY   Substantial  Compliance  \n \nSCPD  must “maintain policies and procedures that are consistent with [the] Agreement  \nand that provide clear direction to ensure that officers and  civilian employees enforce the law  \neffectively, ethically, and constitutionally.”  Agreement  ¶  VIII(a) at 17.   The Agreement also  \nrequires that SCPD ensures that “all officers who take [required] trainings will be  required  to  \npass a test demonstrating a basic comprehension of the training material after  it is presented.”  Id. \n¶  VIII(b).  The Department has met these  requirements.   \n18  ",

Introduction \na. \t In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Eastern District ofNew York (collectively \"United \nStates\") initiated a joint investigation of the Suffolk County Police Department \n(\"SCPD\" or \"Department\").  On September 13,2011, the United States issued a \nTechnical Assistance Letter which provided preliminary observations, advice and \nrecommendations, many of which SCPD has already adopted. \nb. \t The United States recognizes and acknowledges that since the inception of the \ninvestigation, Suffolk County, New York (\"County\") and SCPD have cooperated \nwith the United States. \nc. \t The County, SCPD, Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone, SCPD \nCommissioner Edward Webber, and the United States ofAmerica (collectively, \n\"the Parties\") enter into this agreement (\"Agreement\") to memorialize their joint \ncommitment to ensuring that police services continue to be provided to the people \nof Suffolk County in a manner that complies with the Constitution and the laws of \nthe United States. \nd. \t The Parties have a shared recognition that the ability of a police department to \nprotect the community it serves is promoted through strong relationships with the \ncommunity.  Public safety, lawful policing and the community's trust in its police \nforce are thus interdependent.  The full and sustained implementation ofthis \nAgreement is intended to protect the rights of all members of the community, \nensure the safety and security of the people of Suffolk County, and ensure public \nconfidence in SCPD. \ne. \t In furtherance ofthese goals, the County and the Department agree that the \nDepartment will, as needed, modify certain policies, training, and practices so as \nto comply with the terms ofthis Agreement. \nII.

      "text": " \n \nTHIRD REPORT ASSESSING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \nCOMPLIANCE BY SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 18, 2016 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \nIn January 2014, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Suffolk \nCounty Police Department (“SCPD” or the “Department”) entered into a Settlement Agreement \n(“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement”) to ensure that police services are provided to all \nmembers of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, in a manner that \ncomplies with the Constitution and laws of the United States.1  DOJ, as part of its responsibilities \nfor oversight of SCPD’s implementation of the Settlement Agreement, periodically reports on its \nassessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  This is the third such Assessment \nReport.   \n \nSince we issued our last Assessment Report in December 2015 (the “Second Assessment \nReport”), DOJ representatives from both the Civil Rights Division and the United States \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York reviewed documents and materials \nprovided by SCPD, including revised policies and procedures, copies of internal affairs \ninvestigations, a sample of entries in SCPD’s community relations daily activity reporting \nsystem, and other reports completed during the time period covered by this report.  We also met \nwith SCPD officials, including Commissioner Timothy Sini, SCPD command staff and other \nsupervisors, and SCPD officers, toured six precincts and met with officers at each of those \nprecincts, participated in ride-alongs with on-duty officers, attended three different training \ncourses, and met with members of specialized units, including the Hate Crimes Unit, the Internal \nAffairs Bureau, and the Community Response Bureau.  In addition, we directly engaged the \nSuffolk County community, including the Latino community, both by interviewing community \nmembers about their specific experiences with SCPD and by meeting with community \nadvocates.  In conducting these activities, we consulted with police practice experts with \nsignificant expertise in the areas of policing covered by the Settlement Agreement.     \n    \nWe thank the SCPD officials with whom we met during this assessment period, and we \nappreciate the cooperation and effort that SCPD and Suffolk County leadership continue to show \nin addressing the requirements of the Agreement.  We also thank the many members of the \nSuffolk County community who have met with us and provide us with invaluable feedback.  \n \nThis Assessment Report is divided into two sections.  First, we provide a compliance \nrating for each provision of the Settlement Agreement:  substantial compliance, partial \ncompliance, or non-compliance.  Second, we provide a more detailed analysis of SCPD’s \nsuccesses and challenges to date in each main area of the Agreement:  1) bias-free policing; 2) \nhate crimes and hate incidents; 3) language assistance; 4) allegations of police misconduct; and \n5) community engagement.  As set forth in detail below, while SCPD has made real progress in \nimplementing the requirements of the Settlement Agreement, there remains considerable work to \nbe done in each of these areas.    \n \n    \n                                                           \n1  This Agreement is available in both English and Spanish at https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section-\ncases-and-matters0#police.  \n2 | P age \n \n\nII.   CURRENT COMPLIANCE RATINGS \n \nSection IX of the Settlement Agreement provides that, every six months, the United \nStates will assess and report on SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  See Agreement at 20.  \nThe compliance ratings below represent the United States’ current assessment of SCPD’s \ncompliance with each area of the Agreement.  While Section III of this Report provides more \ndetailed analysis of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, these ratings are included to \nprovide SCPD and the Suffolk County community with a clear and accurate summary of \nprogress to date, as well as areas that remain most in need of attention.   \n \nThe definition of each rating type is as follows: \n \n•  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  \n•  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.    \n•  “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement. \n•  “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation. \n \n \nStatus of \nSettlement Agreement Area \nCompliance  \nIII.

Training  Noncompliance \n \n The Settlement Agreement contains specific provisions designed to ensure that SCPD \ndelivers police services that are “equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that \npromotes broad community engagement and confidence in the Department.”  Agreement at 4.  \nThe Agreement requires that “members of the public receive equal protection of the law, without \nbias based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation, and in \naccordance with the rights, privileges, and immunities secured or protected by the Constitution \nand laws of the United States.”  Id.   \n \nSCPD continues to take steps towards compliance with this section of the Agreement.  As \nset forth below, SCPD has made considerable progress in drafting appropriate policies and \nprocedures in this area.  However, continued progress is needed to ensure those policies and \nprocedures are actually implemented.  Further, in light of significant shortcomings in the bias-\nfree training highlighted in the last Assessment Report, SCPD has put a temporary hold on \nconducting any additional bias-free training until the curriculum can be revised.  While we \nbelieve this action was appropriate given the deficiencies in that training, it is critical that \nappropriate curricula are developed in order to allow training to recommence.  To that end, the \nOffice of Justice Programs of the United States Department of Justice has agreed to provide \nSCPD with a newly developed bias-free training module, which SCPD should tailor to its \nparticular needs over the next few months.  Finally, with respect to data collection, SCPD has \nmade significant progress in remedying the inaccuracies within collected traffic stop data that \nwere highlighted in our last Assessment Report.  Nonetheless, the data collected by SCPD \ncontinues to be insufficient to allow for a meaningful statistical analysis of SCPD’s enforcement \npractices.      \n \nUltimately, although SCPD has worked to develop policies that are largely consistent \nwith the bias-free policing requirements of the Agreement, these measures alone are insufficient \nto address the depth and breadth of the deficiencies that persist in this area.  The Department \nmust make bias-free policing one of SCPD’s highest priorities, and must communicate to all \nSCPD officers—through training, supervision, and accountability mechanisms—that law \nenforcement duties must be performed free of impermissible bias in order for the Department to \nfunction lawfully and effectively.    \n5 | P age \n \n\n \n1.   Policies and Procedures \n \nSCPD has made considerable progress in adopting appropriate policies and procedures in \nthis area.  Nonetheless, SCPD must continue to take steps to ensure that these policies and \nprocedures are properly implemented.   \n \nFor example, Rules & Procedures Chapter 1, Section 11 unequivocally prohibits officers \nfrom “us[ing] race, ethnicity, national origin, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or gender \nidentity when engaging in routine or spontaneous law enforcement activities, except when \nengaging in appropriate suspect-specific activity to identify a particular person or persons.”  The \npolicy also emphasizes the importance of building community trust, and requires SCPD \nmembers who become aware of biased-based policing to immediately report the matter to a \nsupervisor, who in turn must convey the information to Internal Affairs.  In this way, the policy \nprovides a strong foundation for SCPD to ensure policing free from unlawful bias.  Nonetheless, \nas discussed throughout this section, implementation of this policy will require training, \nsupervision, and accountability beyond what is currently in place.     \n \nSCPD has also made clear in policy that, within five days of receipt, SCPD will refer any \ncomplaint of discriminatory policing to the Internal Affairs Bureau for a full investigation.  See \nRules & Procedures Chapter 5, Section 2.  While the adoption of this policy represents \nsignificant progress, we continue to have concerns regarding the processes actually used for \ninvestigating allegations of discriminatory policing.  As set forth in detail in Part III, Section D \nof this report, a large number of misconduct investigations do not proceed in a timely manner, \nwhich results in delays that leave the complainant, accused officer, and SCPD without a \nresolution for far longer than necessary.  This delay can undermine both officer and public \nconfidence in the complaint process.  There have been some positive developments in the area of \ninvestigating allegations of discriminatory policing.  SCPD continues to consistently forward \nsuch investigations to the United States as required by the Agreement.  Agreement at 5.  Further, \nenhanced implementation of the Department’s computerized notification system has the potential \nto improve the complaint investigation process.  Nonetheless, the recommendations set forth in \nPart III, Section D below must be implemented in order for SCPD to achieve substantial \ncompliance.     \n \nSimilarly, SCPD has made significant progress in the area of ensuring adherence to the \nprinciples of bias-free policing and equal protection within SCPD’s hiring, promotion, and \nperformance assessment processes through the revisions made to Chapter 26, Section 1 of the \nRules and Procedures.  The policy appropriately provides that “[a]ll recruitment efforts will \nfocus on providing equal opportunity for all applicants,” irrespective of membership in a \nprotected class “or any other factor not directly related to job performance.”  The policy also \ndirects officers to, inter alia, “maintain positive and productive relationships with community \nleaders, educational institutions and religious organizations” and make continuous efforts to \n“recruit eligible applicants at high schools and colleges.”  Id.  Further, on August 24, 2015, \nSCPD issued Applicant Investigations Command General Order 15-01, prohibiting the hiring of \nany candidate who “has committed any discriminatory act or . . . evinces a biased perspective \nbased upon race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation that indicates \nsuch candidate is not be able [sic] to perform the duties of police officer in a non-discriminatory \n6 | P age \n \n\nmanner.”  But while the adoption of these directives is significant progress, as SCPD \nacknowledges in its Self Assessment Report, additional work is needed to ensure that these \npolicies are adhered to in practice.  See Compliance Report Assessing Implementation of the \n2014 Settlement Agreement between the United States and the Suffolk County Police Dep’t  \n(Feb. 15, 2016) (“SCPD Self Assessment Report”) at 8.  SCPD must demonstrate that it is \nconducting the investigations, reviews, and screenings targeting a history of bias and/or biased \npolicing, and that equal protection measures are being enforced.   \n \nIt is important to note that, in the course of SCPD’s ongoing efforts to ensure that bias-\nfree related policies and procedures are fully implemented, it is likely that SCPD or the United \nStates will identify needed modifications to policies that have already been adopted.  In our last \nAssessment Report, for example, we recommended minor modifications to Chapter 1, Section 11 \nof the Rules and Procedures, as well as to Chapter 26, Section 1.  We appreciate the \nDepartment’s willingness to adopt those recommendations.  The United States is committed to \ncontinuing to work with SCPD to evaluate and provide feedback regarding policies and \nprocedures as they are implemented.     \n \n 2.    Traffic Stop Data \n \n A key requirement of the Settlement Agreement is the collection of meaningful and \naccurate traffic stop data.  See Agreement at 6.  Meeting this requirement is critical, as ensuring \nthat policing services are delivered in a manner free from bias requires the collection and \nanalysis of accurate information regarding SCPD’s practices.  Significant steps remain necessary \nto ensure the collection and analysis of this data.  \n \n SCPD has made strides in improving its collection of traffic stop data.  Officers now \nrecord critical information in their mobile data terminals.  Officers report that the data collection \ninterface on the mobile data terminals functions well, and that they are able to input necessary \ndata in a timely and efficient manner.  Precinct supervisors have also increased the attention \nplaced on ensuring these reports are filled out completely.  During this rating period, there has \nbeen a notable reduction in the proportion of traffic stop data that is left incomplete.  \n \n Nonetheless, the data collected by SCPD continues to be inadequate to allow for the \nneeded assessments of SCPD’s enforcement practices.  Most significantly, the data collected by \nSCPD omits critical variables that are necessary for meaningful analysis.  For example, SCPD \ndoes not collect any meaningful data regarding why a traffic stop was initiated.  Without detailed \ndata regarding the reason for a stop—e.g., speeding violation, equipment violation, etc.—it is \nimpossible to determine whether the outcomes of traffic stops are based upon the severity of the \nviolation, or are instead impermissibly influenced by bias.  By enhancing SCPD’s current data \ncollection practices to include detailed information regarding why a stop was initiated, SCPD \nwill be able to evaluate whether similar offenses result in similar outcomes independent of the \nrace, ethnicity, or other protected characteristic of the driver or passenger, or are instead \ninfluenced by unlawful bias.  As another example, while SCPD collects data regarding whether \nan officer conducts a search during a traffic stop, critical data regarding conducted searches is \nomitted.  As an example, SCPD does not track whether a search was conducted of the driver \nalone or instead the passenger or the entire vehicle; SCPD does not track the duration of the \nsearch; and, most significantly, SCPD does not consistently track whether a search yielded a \n7 | P age \n \n\nfinding of contraband such as weapons or controlled substances.  Without this data, SCPD is \nunable to meaningfully assess whether there are disparities in search practices that suggest those \npractices are influenced by unlawful bias.  Further, collection of such data is not only necessary \nto ensure bias-free policing; such data also serves as an effective management tool and has the \npotential to promote efficiency by showing which law enforcement strategies are most effective.     \n \n In a June 22, 2015 letter to SCPD’s counsel regarding language access, bias-free \npolicing, and accountability policies and practices, we noted these and other shortcomings in the \nrange of data collected by SCPD, and made specific recommendations regarding additional data \nthat should be collected and analyzed.  Additionally, during our on-site meetings with SCPD \nofficials between March 10 and March 15, 2016, we discussed in detail the need for enhanced \ndata collection.  Implementing these recommendations and expanding SCPD’s data collection \npractices should be of the highest priority for the Department over the next several months.  We \nwill continue to provide any assistance we can as the Department undertakes those efforts.   \n \nFurthermore, as noted in our last Assessment Report, SCPD identified flaws in its \nprocedures that made the collection of traffic stop data unreliable prior to July 2015.  SCPD \nnotes in its Self Assessment Report that these flaws resulted in approximately 7,000 incomplete \nrecords.  See SCPD Self Assessment Report at 10.  While the Department has taken measures to \ncorrect the systemic errors that lead to these problems, including by improving the retrieval \nsoftware used by the Department, it is critical for SCPD to continue to monitor collected data in \norder to quickly identify and correct any future errors that may arise.      \n \nSCPD must take meaningful steps to ensure that collected data is analyzed and that \nappropriate measures are taken when this analysis reveals problematic conduct.  The Settlement \nAgreement requires that, at least annually, SCPD provide the United States with a report \ncontaining this analysis and a summary of the remedial measures taken, if any.  Agreement at 6.  \nGiven the shortcomings within the data collected by SCPD, including the technical errors that \nresulted in unreliable data prior to July 2015, SCPD has not yet been able to comply with this \nprovision of the Agreement.  SCPD’s immediate priority must be to ensure that appropriate data \nis collected and accurately recorded during each traffic stop.  To that end, SCPD must work to \ndevelop appropriate benchmarks that are required for certain types of analysis.  The United \nStates will work with SCPD to assist in the development of these benchmarks.          \n \nFinally, SCPD supervisors must incorporate a substantive review of traffic stop data into \ntheir regular supervisory activities.  While it is clear that SCPD supervisors are making a \nconcerted effort to ensure traffic stop data is consistently and completely entered, supervisors’ \nuse of this data is entirely inconsistent.  Many supervisors do not regularly review traffic stop \ndata collected by their officers likely stems, at least in part, from the fact that supervisors have \nnot received appropriate training regarding how to best make use of this data.  Indeed, SCPD \nfails to provide any specific, recurring supervisory training; instead, supervisors are trained \nregarding how to perform supervisory functions only when they are promoted to the rank of \nsergeant.  SCPD should strongly consider developing and implementing specific, recurring \ntraining for supervisors that includes instruction on how to use collected data to ensure officers \nare performing effectively and lawfully.         \n \n \n8 | P age \n \n\n 3.    Training \n \nEnsuring bias-free policing requires that officers receive effective training in how to \nconduct law enforcement activities in an equitable manner.  The Settlement Agreement requires \nthat all sworn officers receive training on bias-free policing at least annually.  See Agreement at \n6-7.  The Agreement provides that SCPD’s training on bias-free policing “will emphasize that \ndiscriminatory policing, in the form of either selective enforcement or non-enforcement of the \nlaw, including the selecting or rejecting of particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited \nby policy and will subject officers to disciplinary action.”  Id.  The Agreement also sets forth \nspecific elements that must be incorporated into bias-free training.  Id.  \n \n As explained in detail in our last Assessment Report, SCPD’s revised bias-free policing \ntraining was both pedagogically and substantively deficient.  See Second Assessment Report at \n16-19.  Acknowledging these deficiencies, SCPD has elected to suspend delivery of its bias-free \npolicing training until the curriculum can be comprehensively revised to comport with the \nrequirements of the Settlement Agreement and best practices in the field.  SCPD’s efforts will be \nassisted by the Office of Justice Programs of the United States Department of Justice, which has \nagreed to provide SCPD with technical assistance in the form of a train-the-trainer bias-free \npolicing training module.  To be clear, SCPD will need to shape this module to be consistent \nwith its specific rules and procedures and to fit its particular needs.  Nonetheless, this assistance \npromises to aid SCPD in fulfilling its obligation to provide effective training on bias-free \npolicing.   \n \n SCPD has also developed and begun the delivery of cultural sensitivity training.  As set \nforth in Part III, Section C, this training also has significant pedagogical and substantive \nshortcomings.  As SCPD works to adopt and implement bias-free policing training, the \nDepartment should also ensure that cultural sensitivity training is expanded and fully \nincorporated.    \n \nB.  HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \n \nIV. HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Training  Partial Compliance \n   b.  Tracking and Reporting  Partial Compliance \n   c.  Quality Assurance  Partial Compliance \n \n \nSCPD has made significant strides in the area of hate crimes and hate incidents since \nentering into the Agreement, most notably in its hate crimes training and investigations, and we \ncommend the progress.  The Department successfully implemented many of the \nrecommendations in our last Assessment Report, including restructuring the format of the hate \n9 | P age \n \n\ncrimes training and implementing more rigorous data analyses for quality assurance purposes.  \nSee Second Assessment Report at 20-24.  However, substantial improvements are still required, \nparticularly in how officers identify potential hate crime offenses and refer them to the Hate \nCrimes Unit (“HCU”), and in the hate crime mapping process.  Accordingly, SCPD continues to \nbe in partial compliance with the hate crime provisions of the Agreement.   \n \n1.  Training  \n \na.  Format \n \nThe Department has made several changes to address the problems with SCPD’s hate \ncrimes training that we had identified in the last Assessment Report.  A primary concern was that \nthe training presentation needed better structure and organization.  SCPD adopted our \nrecommendations and has made the necessary changes.  The training we observed in March 2016 \nopened with a road-map for the course, listed the objectives, and clearly detailed the topics to be \ncovered.  The introduction laid out the community policing philosophy behind the hate crimes \ntraining:  to provide fair policing to all members of the community, foster positive community \nrelations, and increase police legitimacy by properly dealing with and investigating potential hate \ncrime offenses.  See Rules & Procedures Chapter 1, Section 11.  Nonetheless, while the training \nwas effective overall, several concerning statements were made during the training that \ncommunicated mixed messages regarding the purpose and importance of ensuring appropriate \nhate crimes enforcement.  We will communicate these specific concerns directly with SCPD’s \ntraining coordinators, but overall, this training was markedly improved.   \n \nIn our last Assessment Report, we had recommended pedagogical changes to the hate \ncrimes training.  See Second Assessment Report at 20-21. At the time, the training had been \nalmost entirely lecture-based.  Such an approach does not sufficiently engage students.  Instead, \nthe training should have elements of participatory and scenario-based learning.  SCPD has \nembraced this approach.  The training we saw in March incorporated a prepared lecture with \nslide and video presentations, small group discussions, and interactive role playing exercises in \nwhich participants reasoned through scenarios that raised points of law and proper police \nprocedure.  These changes are a significant improvement to the previous versions of the training \nand should increase its effectiveness in educating officers about the concepts underlying hate \ncrimes laws.  Indeed, the majority of those in attendance actively participated and seemed \ngenuinely engaged with the material.  The three-hour course was an appropriate length to cover \nthe subject and provided sufficient time to incorporate group discussions and exercises in \ncombination with the lecture.   \n \nb.  Curriculum Substance \n \nThe training curriculum should teach officers how to identify hate crimes by providing \ninstruction on the elements and proper charging of these offenses.  Although the training was, \noverall, very good, we have concerns that the training lacked clarity regarding 1) the substance \nof the New York State Hate Crimes Statute, and 2) the process for determining whether an \nincident is a potential hate offense and its referral to HCU.  The discussion of hate-based graffiti \nas aggravated harassment in the first degree also needs to be refined, especially given that it is \nthe most common hate offense occurring in Suffolk County. \n10 | P age \n \n\n \n The instructor did not provide an accurate explanation of the legal standard under New \nYork State Hate Crimes Law, NYSPL § 485.05(1a).  The law requires that the perpetrator \nintentionally commit the offense against a person “in whole or substantial part” because of \nbeliefs or perceptions about the victim’s identity.  See id.  Rather, the instructor incorrectly stated \nthat “in whole or substantial part” means fifty-one percent or more.  The standard does not \nrequire this showing, but rather that a considerable part of the perpetrator’s motivation in \ncommitting the offense is based on his or her belief or perception that the victim is a member of \na protected class.  See, e.g., People v. Fox, 844 N.Y.S.2d 627, 638 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2007) (noting \nthat “any person of ordinary intelligence would understand that the words ‘in whole’ mean \ncompletely or entirely and the words . . . ‘substantial part’ mean a considerable portion or \namount”) (citation omitted).  This portion of the presentation must be changed as it misstates the \nlaw and will result in the under-identification of potential hate crimes.   \n \nThe instructor also needs to revise his description of the process by which an incident is \nflagged as a potential hate crime or hate incident and then referred to HCU for investigation.  \nThe instructor stated that when officers suspect that an incident could be a hate crime, they \nshould conduct the legal analysis and notify their supervisors or HCU if they conclude the \nincident may have been hate motivated.  The instructor explained that the supervisors then \nshould conduct the same analysis and decide whether to refer the case to HCU.  It was unclear \nwho has the discretion to decide whether an incident warrants notifying HCU. The instructor \nseemed to suggest that both the officer and the supervisor have discretion to decide whether to \nrefer the incident to HCU.  However, the instructor also stated that when there is any indication \nof racial bias, such as the uttering of a racial epithet during a road rage incident, HCU should \nautomatically be notified, thus implying the officer and supervisor do not have any discretion.  \nThe training must be revised so that officers have a clear understanding of this process.   \n \nOur interviews with officers and supervisors confirm the lack of clarity about this \nprocess.  Officers at different ranks do not seem to have a consistent understanding of when \nHCU should be notified. The training instructor, supervisors, and officers seemed to believe to \nsome extent that “when in doubt, notify the supervisor or the Hate Crimes Unit.”  However, the \nsupervising officers do not seem to agree on the appropriate criteria to use when deciding \nwhether to notify HCU.  For example, when given a hypothetical of an event that, at first glance, \ndid not appear to be racially motivated, but in which the victim said “I feel like this was done to \nme because I am black,” one supervisor remarked that he would not call HCU if he felt that the \nact was not racially motivated.   Another supervisor said that given the victim’s allegation, he \nwould refer the case to HCU for investigation and a final determination.  Our recommendation is \nthat officers should notify HCU anytime there has been a racial slur during the commission of a \ncrime to allow HCU detectives to investigate and track such incidents as they may, in the \naggregate, show a pattern of animus that police can then monitor.  In sum, the process for \nanalyzing potential hate offenses and the levels of discretion are unclear, and the training set \nforth contradictory standards.  SCPD should revise the hate crimes training to establish clear \nguidelines for identifying and referring potential hate offenses to HCU, which has the expertise \nto properly evaluate potential hate crimes.  \n \nLastly, the training’s instruction on swastika graffiti should be refined to avoid confusion \nabout New York’s hate crimes statutes.  Swastikas, burning crosses, and nooses are images that \n11 | P age \n \n\nepitomize religion- and race-based hate.  However, these incidents are not prosecuted under \nSection 485.05 of the penal law.  Instead, they fall under Section 240.31of the penal law—\naggravated harassment in the first degree.  See NYPL § 240.31(3); see also id., § (4) (cross \nburning), § (5) (noose displays or images).  The instructor first covered Section 485.05, and \nproperly noted that swastika drawing is not a chargeable offense under the statute, without \ndiscussing that it is, however, aggravated harassment in the first degree, and Section 240.31 was \ncovered later in the course.  We recommend that the two statutes be presented together to \nemphasize that while these offenses might intuitively appear to be hate crimes under New York \nPenal Law Section 485.05, they are actually prosecuted as aggravated harassment in the first \ndegree.  It is critically important that officers understand this because SCPD has identified hate-\nbased graffiti as the number one hate-based offense in Suffolk County. \nc.  Course Examples and Scenarios \n \nIt is important that the hate crimes training use examples and scenarios to reinforce the \nconcepts being taught.  There were several examples that were effective in illustrating successful \ninvestigations of potential hate offenses; for example, the trainers described a case in which a pig \nhead was thrown at a Jewish family’s home and the subsequent investigation finding that the \nincident was not hate-motivated, but rather the result of a teenage break-up.  The presentation \nalso included an example of a minority-perpetrated hate crime to illustrate that hate crimes can \nbe committed by members of protected classes. However, certain examples included elements \nthat could mislead officers when trying to evaluate potential hate offenses.  For example, in one \nhypothetical, the perpetrator of a potential hate offense was described as “from Tennessee,” and \nthe instructor implied that this might be evidence of a propensity toward racial discrimination.  \nBut the perpetrator’s home state is immaterial and presenting this fact as relevant to a hate crimes \nanalysis undercuts the message that officers should not generalize about individuals based upon \nindividual traits.  The training should not encourage officers to rely on stereotypes of any kind, \nincluding geographic stereotypes, in evaluating hate offenses.    \n \nAt certain points there was a lack of cultural sensitivity in remarks that appeared to be \nintended as light humor.  For example, when discussing a case about a woman who was \nsupposedly promiscuous, the instructor stated that he did not think “slut” is a protected class.  \nWhen discussing the various protected classes the instructor stated that “transgender is a \nprotected class, believe it or not.”  These statements send the wrong message in a hate crimes \ntraining where the purpose of the course is animated by the belief that people should not be \nvictimized on the basis of an individual trait.   \n \n2.  Tracking, Reporting, and Pattern Analyses \n \nPreventing hate crimes requires police to track, analyze, and identify patterns and trends \nof hate crimes and incidents.  SCPD’s tracking of hate crimes has improved significantly since \nentering into the Settlement Agreement.  HCU is responsible for investigating, tracking, \nreporting, and analyzing hate crimes and their patterns.  It relies primarily on 911 notifications \nthat an incident might be a hate crime, and upon officers or supervisors to notify HCU about \npotential hate-based offenses.  These are obvious and necessary methods for tracking hate \ncrimes.  HCU also conducts a daily audit of SCPD’s crime log to identify potential hate offenses \nthat might have been missed by 911 dispatchers or officers.  While manual searches of the crime \n12 | P age \n \n\nlog provide a check on the system for flagging potential hate offenses, HCU would benefit from \na more systematic method of trend analysis to ensure none are slipping through the cracks.   \n \nWe have a significant concern with the methodology that SCPD employees use for data \nreporting and analysis—in particular, the manner of sharing of information between HCU and \nthe Criminal Intelligence Unit (“CIU”), and the pattern mapping process.  Both units map hate \noffenses and there is not a clear protocol regarding who has primary responsibility for this task.  \nIndeed, in talking with members of these units, it is apparent that a clearer understanding of each \nunit’s respective role should be developed.  Without a clear delineation of responsibilities \nbetween HCU and CIU, critical data is likely to be omitted.  More coordination is needed among \nthe precinct analysts, HCU, and CIU.  Further, establishing clear procedures will ensure that \nthese units are not duplicating efforts.   Finally, regardless of who is conducting the analysis, \nanalysts do not consistently track trends over time, nor do they employ quantitative methods to \nunderstand correlations between particular types of crimes and other variables such as the \ndemographic characteristics of victims and suspects and the locations of incidents.   \n \n3.  Quality Assurance \n \nIn our Second Assessment Report, we recommended that SCPD expand the Hate Crimes \nReports required under the Agreement by including, for example, the legal analysis for \ndetermining whether a particular incident was a hate crime, and providing the case progress.  See \nSecond Assessment Report at 25-26.  HCU has done an impressive job of auditing and analyzing \nthose hate crimes that it has identified.   SCPD’s most recent Hate Crimes Report included \ndetailed descriptions of nine hate crime investigations.  Each case description included the fact \npattern, analysis of the fact pattern, the steps undertaken in the investigation, and the status of the \ncase.  The Hate Crimes Report then provided an overall conclusion, finding that:  1) the majority \nof hate crimes in Suffolk County are religion-motivated; and 2) crimes involving the deception \nof elderly persons are a trend.  It also provided information about the efforts SCPD is taking to \naddress hate-based crime through community outreach.  We also had recommended analyzing \ndata to identify the prevalence and breakdown of hate crimes.  SCPD has included a table \nindicating the number of HCU investigations with the number that were found to be hate \noffenses, a pie chart showing the break-down of hate offenses by protected class, and maps of \ncrime patterns.  In sum, the Hate Crimes Report evidences HCU’s thorough review and analysis \nof its investigations and hate crime tracking.  \n \nThe Hate Crimes Report also details how HCU detectives proactively canvass \ncommunities that may be targets of hate offenses to create open lines of communication, \nencourage the reporting of hate crimes, and collect hate crime information.  Community Oriented \nPolicing Enforcement (COPE) officers conduct community outreach for the same purposes, and \nwe commend these outreach and investigative efforts. \n \nWe have a minor recommendation for the signs that HCU posts in the community to \nsolicit leads about hate crimes.  HCU posts a general crime reporting sign to encourage reporting \npotential hate offenses.  See Hate Crimes Report, Attachment 5.  The Department should \nconsider also posting a hate crimes specific sign, explaining what a hate crime is, because it \nmight have better results in getting information about hate crimes.  Lastly, the Spanish version of \n13 | P age \n \n\nthe sign should not use script, as it is harder to read, especially when it is publicly posted and \nthus meant to be read quickly.  See id., Attachment 6. \n \nC.  LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE \n \nV. LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Policy  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Language Line Order \nCompliance \n   c.  Policy on Persons with Limited English Proficiency  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial  \n   d.  Spanish-language access to SCPD website \nCompliance \n   e.  Incentives for Interpreters  Noncompliance \n   f.  Consultation with the Latino Community  Partial Compliance \n   g.  Language Assistance Training  Partial Compliance \n   h.  Community Survey  Partial Compliance \n \n \nOne of the cornerstone elements of the Settlement Agreement is the requirement that \nSCPD develop a robust Language Assistance program, to ensure that police officers and others \nin the Department are able to communicate effectively with individuals in the community who \nhave Limited English Proficiency (“LEP”).  See Agreement at 8-11. Such communication is vital \nfor ensuring that LEP crime victims are able to receive appropriate police services, protecting the \ncivil and constitutional rights of LEP individuals who are arrested or otherwise charged with \ncriminal conduct, and, more broadly, developing a closer relationship with LEP communities and \nthereby strengthening SCPD’s ability to address and prevent crime in those communities. \n \n As noted below, although SCPD has written an appropriate policy on language access, \nthat policy is not yet being properly implemented.  Language assistance is provided unevenly at \nbest.  We hope and expect that this will improve with enhancements to the Language Access \ntraining program and as more Department personnel receive the training, along with improved \nreview and enforcement of language assistance in the field.  \n \n1.  Language Access Policy \n \n SCPD has made strides towards developing and implementing appropriate policies and \npractices with respect to LEP individuals over the last two years.  It now has in place a strong, \nintegrated Language Access Plan (“LAP”).  Rules & Procedures Chapter 26, Section 5.  The \n14 | P age \n \n\nLAP is helpful in its detail, but we recommend that SCPD prepare a distilled version of the \npolicy, one to two pages long, to assist officers to understand and effectively implement the \npolicy.  During our tour, several Department members expressed support for this idea.  Such a \ndocument would also help the community understand the policy.  In fact, a postcard sized \ninformation card on the rights of an individual to request translation services could be developed \nand translated into the five primary languages.   \n \n The LAP has been appropriately translated into Spanish and the other priority languages. \nSCPD has consistently distributed the Spanish version of the LAP at SCPD facilities and \nmaintains a copy on its website in five of the priority languages.  However, the LAP was not \nalways available in precincts during our review, and if it was available, not all desk officers were \naware of this.  One desk officer at a precinct did not know where the LAP was kept or whether it \nwas available to the public. \n \n Moreover, now that the policies have been translated into languages other than Spanish, \nthese should be reviewed by community stakeholders to ensure that the translations are \nappropriate for local linguistic communities.  For example, the Chinese translations are not \nconsistent—the policy is written in Simplified Chinese and the complaint/compliment form is \nwritten in traditional Chinese.   We also encourage the Department to continue to widen its \ndistribution of the LAP, and ensure that LEP communities have the opportunity not only to \naccess the policy but to review and comment on it to ensure accuracy.  The Department also \nmust ensure that precincts have appropriate posted signs translated into the priority non-English \nlanguages. \n \n2.  Training  \n \n Unlike in the past, SCPD is now providing four hours of language access training, \nincluding an hour of cultural competency training.  Pedagogically, the language access training \nprogram has some excellent features, but requires additional revisions.  There was mixed use of \nvideos in this training.  Some were effective; the use of video that was most effective included \npausing the video to have a larger group discussion about the issues the video raised.   The \ndiscussion itself needed further development, however.  There was some resistance from students \nto the lesson that language assistance could lead to better outcomes, because the example video \nincluded policing mistakes unrelated to language access—one student said “the example was a \nstupid cop.”  The instructors did not effectively address the importance of language access policy \nin response to this critique.  \n \n Additionally, more could be done to create opportunities for interactive discussion in \nsmall groups after the video presentations.  There was a short video training on basic Spanish \nphrases, but instructors left the room for the video and, without further dialogue, this video alone \nwas not effective.  Many officers appeared to stop paying attention and were checking their \nphones during this part of the training.  Overall, the training should include more scenarios and \nrole play, focusing on common encounters with LEP individuals.  For example, the \ndemonstration for using the Language Line was good, but the same should be done with teaching \nthe four stated “How Tos” in the LAP.  Incorporation of the LAP into scenarios in other training \nwould serve to reinforce that LEP individuals may be encountered in any situation; i.e., domestic \nviolence training in a scenario where the only one present who speaks English is a young child. \n15 | P age \n \n\n \nWith regard to substance, the program started with an hour of Cultural Competency \ntraining.  This part of the training did not meet the minimum standards for teaching this subject.  \nThe stated objectives for the program were unclear and, as a result, the program lacked focus.  \nFor the most part, culture and the need to be aware of cultural differences were discussed only in \na general sense.  Little of what was discussed was integrated into a discussion of how culture can \naffect how officers should do their jobs.  The program did not define culture, nor did it explain \nhow cultural orientation can affect the interpretation of events.  It also did not present any \ninformation regarding how people of different cultures respond differently to external stimuli.  \nNor did the program lay out any strategies to help officers navigate challenges of dealing with \npeople with different cultural practices.  This critical portion of the training needs to be \ncompletely revamped. \nThe Language Assistance Tracking forms were covered in detail, and people were trained \nregarding how to complete them.  The purpose and process of these forms were also explained in \ndetail.  However, there was no discussion of the role of third parties in reporting and complaint \nsituations, and how even in cases where an advocate or other third party is capable of \ninterpreting, a neutral interpreter is still required (Language Line or Department Authorized \nInterpreters (“DAIs”)).  SCPD needs to better instruct officers about when and why they are \nrequired to use department-authorized language assistance services, including Language Line.  \nOfficers have expressed concern about the time and effort it takes to access those services; they \nneed to understand why it is in their best interests to do so.  More detailed discussion of different \nscenarios on the use of interpretation at the precinct, in the field, and in exigent circumstances, \nwould serve to enhance officers’ understanding.  For example, the training should contain more \ndiscussion of the exigency exception so that officers can understand when and for how long they \ncan stray from using DAIs, qualified bilingual officers, or Language Line.  Greater discussion of \nthe use of either children or an unauthorized interpreter is important because these have been the \nmost relied upon sources of language assistance for years, and they are no longer permitted, \nexcept during an exigency.  Some attendees also had concerns about the use of Language Line in \ntaking statements and other testimony for court.  Instructors did not have an adequate answer to \nalleviate this concern. \n \n Students should be given a copy of the LAP, and it should be discussed, section by \nsection, to learn what the policy requires.  A distilled version of the LAP, which must be \ndeveloped, should be reviewed at the end of the program as final takeaways.  Merely referencing \nthe LAP is insufficient.  SCPD instructors also should receive procedural justice training and \nincorporate the principles of procedural justice into the Effective Communication lesson. (See \nhere for some police training podcasts on the topic:  \nhttp://www.cops.usdoj.gov/default.asp?Item=2656).\n \n \n3.  Implementation of LAP in the Field \n \n As more officers are trained in Language Assistance, we expect the use of Language \nAssistance tools, including DAIs and Language Line, to become more widespread.  At present, \nhowever, officers appear to continue to lack recognition of the need for use of language access \nservices.  Some officers appear to believe that Language Line interpretation services should be \nused only in connection with calls for service, but not used for non-crime calls.  Many calls for \n16 | P age \n \n\nservice that are not crimes are also serious (e.g., traffic accident with serious injuries), and may \nrequire the use of an interpreter.  Moreover, this is not an accurate reflection of the policy.  \n(Rules and Procedures, Chapter 26, Section 5, II.B notes “Department personnel shall provide \nfree language assistance services to LEP individuals, and shall inform members of the \ncommunity that language assistance services are available to them free of charge.”)  Training and \nsupervision should directly address this issue.   \n \n Likewise, officers still appear to be improperly relying upon bystanders and children for \nlanguage assistance.  Some officers have been in the practice of using bystanders and children \nand see no reason not to continue to do so because they have never had a problem doing so in the \npast.  Others see no need to use language assistance tools because they believe that people who \nwould require them do not call the police due to language barriers.  Yet others appear to believe \nthat children can be helpful in giving officers a good idea of what is happening.  These \nmisapprehensions must be addressed, in training sessions, roll call, and during direct supervision \nof officers.  \n \n4.  Tracking Use of Language Access Assistance \n \n SCPD has now implemented a language assistance tracking program using CAD \ncomputers in patrol cars.  Any call that a 911 dispatcher receives for which language assistance \nis indicated is assigned a “Lima” code.  Before an officer is able to close out a call with a Lima \ndesignation, the officer must complete a Language Assistance Tracking form in the CAD system \nthat indicates, among other things, what language assistance, if any, was provided on the call.  \nThis requirement serves two purposes: first, to prompt officers to use language assistance \nservices, and second, to ensure that they record the services provided.  This has led to increased \nnumbers of completed forms than in the past.  The forms provide valuable information to the \nDepartment on compliance with the policy, gaps in service, and other emerging needs.  In \nprecincts, the front desk officer and civilian staff also provide language assistance to people, but \ncomplete the language assistance forms by hand, and administrative personnel input the \ninformation into the CAD system.  This raises a concern that these kinds of services are less \nlikely to be fully documented in SCPD’s data.  Precinct personnel should be able to input their \nuse of language access services directly into the CAD system. \n \n The development of Lima codes and use of the CAD system to document interactions \nwith LEPs is a very positive development.  However, supervisory review of Lima data is \ninconsistent.  SCPD must develop procedures to ensure: 1) the accuracy of Lima data; and 2) that \nofficers are appropriately assessing language needs and appropriately using language services.  \nThis would include comprehensive review of the language assistance tracking forms, 911 calls, \nand Language Line data, and developing an analytical plan to ensure proper adherence to the \npolicy and emerging language needs. \n \n5.  Language Assistance in the 911 Call Center \n \n  The Communications Section has developed excellent systems to identify and respond to \ncalls it receives from LEP individuals.  In addition to employing bilingual operators, all operators \nhave instant access to Language Line, and reported using it frequently.  The Department also \nemploys a number of Spanish-speaking operators who should, consistent with developing \n17 | P age \n \n\ndepartment policy, become certified as bilingual employees.  However, SCPD does not employ \nenough Spanish-speaking operators to ensure coverage on every shift, and this should be \nremedied.    \n \n The Communications Section has also developed a variety of information about the \ncommunity to better identify and respond to LEP calls for service.  In addition to these efforts, \nwe recommend that SCPD develop and use the detailed demographic information available on \nSuffolk County’s LEP population to assist it in identifying language assistance needs in the field \nas calls come in.  Review of the 911 interface in the Communications Section appeared to show \nthat Lima codes were incorporated into the system by changing the values in an existing field, \nrather than adding a new field for tracking LEP callers to the database.  This creates a dropdown \nlist twice as long as before, with code options that are nearly identical, differing only in the L \ndesignation.  This may be resulting in some data entry error, in both directions—over-\nidentification and under-identification of LEP calls.  We recommend that SCPD seek a \nprogramming solution that reduces this error and improves the usability of the 911 interface. \nFinally, one additional concern, shared by SCPD, is that a large number of forms were \nclosed as “THE VICTIM/COMPLAINANT SPOKE SUFFICIENT ENGLISH TO \nCOMMUNICATE” (65 percent of no language assistance given cases) and “NON-LIMA \nCALL” (7 percent of no language assistance given cases). This percentage has increased over the \nlast few months.  Further inquiry into this data is required to ensure that it is accurate, and to \nbetter understand if LEP individuals are receiving necessary police services. \n \n6.  Qualification of DAIs and Bilingual Officers \n \n A cornerstone of a successful language access plan is to ensure that personnel who \nprovide language access services have the necessary skills to effectively communicate with LEP \nindividuals.  The Settlement Agreement requires that before bilingual personnel engage in \nmonolingual conversation in a language other than English or provide interpretation services \nthrough DAIs, they must pass an appropriate test and be deemed qualified.  See Agreement at 10.  \nSCPD has only begun to implement these requirements.  Only a few individuals have been tested \nand certified as DAIs or bilingual officers.  This process must be accelerated. Further, no one \nwithin the Department has yet been certified as to translate documents.   \n \n Further, officers need to better understand the appropriate role of bilingual personnel and \nDAIs.  As noted, officers remain unclear about when they are permitted to use bystanders and \nfamily members, and when and how to employ the services of DAIs, Language Line, and \nbilingual personnel.  Training, both at the Academy and at roll call, needs to clearly articulate \nthese matters. \n \n7.  Translation of Critical Documents \n \nSCPD has translated many critical documents, including, importantly, the complaint/ \ncompliment form, into Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Haitian Creole, Italian, Polish, and \nPortuguese.  The Department is still in the process of developing online submission capability \nfor compliments and complaints, as well as the translation of the form into other non-English \nlanguages, as appropriate.  However, review of SCPD’s website provides no evidence of the \n18 | P age \n \n\ncompliment and complaint phone line on the “contact us” page, and the line is not mentioned on \nthe “Información en Español” page (the number for the community response bureau is provided).  \nThis could be one reason that SCPD reports that it has received only one piece of correspondence \nin a language other than English.   \n \nSCPD should reassess barriers to receiving correspondence in languages other than \nEnglish.  There may be a need to publicize that the Department will accept correspondence in \nlanguages other than English and that it will translate the written communications.  Indeed, \ncommunity advocates noted that the public is not aware of this complaint line.  Likewise, the \nSpanish version of the compliment/complaint form does not have a note that the phone operators \nspeak Spanish or any other language. \n \nFinally, we recommend that SCPD add a footer to each translated document identifying \n(in English) the foreign language in which the document has been translated and the date of the \nlast update to the translation.  This best practice makes it easy for officers to access appropriate \n \ntranslations of forms and documents and ensure up-to-date information is available to the public. \n \nD.  ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \n \nVI. ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Reporting Misconduct  Partial Compliance \n   b.  Investigation of Misconduct  Partial Compliance \n \n SCPD has made significant structural reforms to its Internal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”) \nwithin the past year, and the Police Commissioner, other SCPD leadership, and the new \ncommand staff at IAB have expressed a serious commitment to enhancing the stature of IAB and \nreducing the backlog of cases under investigation by IAB.  We are encouraged by these changes \nand hope that they will lead to significant improvements in the timeliness and effectiveness of \nSCPD’s internal investigations—and that this, in turn, will help to bolster the community’s \nconfidence in the Department.  These structural changes are still relatively new and untested, \nhowever, and we continue to have concerns with SCPD’s accountability procedures, as well as \nthe Department’s ability and willingness to support members of the community filing complaints \nabout officer misconduct.  We describe SCPD’s areas of improvement and our outstanding \nconcerns in more detail below. \n \n1.   Reporting Misconduct \n \nAlthough we recognize that SCPD has made significant efforts to increase the \ncommunity’s awareness of and accessibility to means of submitting complaints of officer \nmisconduct, we continue to believe that SCPD needs to do more work with the community and \nwith its precincts in order to fully enable community members to file complaints.  We continue \nto hear troubling stories about members of the community encountering problems with \nsubmitting complaints, both in person at their local precincts and directly to IAB, and about \n19 | P age \n \n\ncommunity advocates facing significant resistance to the submission of third-party complaints.  \nWe note that, although SCPD has established a variety of means by which individuals outside of \nthe Department may file complaints, there continue to be significant gaps in the community’s \nawareness of how to submit complaints and in the community’s level of confidence that external \ncomplaints will be accepted and handled in a fair and timely manner.   \n \nWe recommend that SCPD assess how, when, and from where external complaints are \nsubmitted to the Department, to identify where there continue to be gaps in the community’s \naccess to complaint procedures and to develop strategies for closing those gaps.  For example, \nSCPD appears to be planning to rely heavily on online procedures for receiving complaints; \nwhile useful, we are concerned that over relying on online methods may result in the process not \nbeing accessible to segments of the community that either do not have easy access to computers \nor that tend to access the Internet through their phones, which may not be conducive to \nsubmitting a complaint.  An assessment of when the Department learns of complaints against its \nofficers also may help IAB identify problem areas in its outreach to and relations with the \ncommunity.  If, for example, IAB learns of an individual’s complaint only when the individual \nfiles a lawsuit against SCPD, then there has been a delay in the information reaching SCPD that \nis likely to seriously compromise the Department’s ability to work cooperatively with the \ncomplainant or to conduct an effective investigation of the allegations.  If SCPD were to identify \na trend of IAB learning of allegations of officer misconduct well after the occurrence of the \nunderlying incidents, it should suggest to SCPD that IAB would benefit from doing more to \nencourage and enable complaints being filed soon after the occurrence of an incident – and, at \nleast indirectly, this would help SCPD avoid more complicated and more contentious responses \nfrom the community, such as litigation against SCPD.  Although we heard and recognize that \nmembers of SCPD and IAB in particular feel as if they have adequately engaged the community \nin order to facilitate complaints, it is critical—as much for SCPD’s compliance with these \nprovisions as for the integrity of its IAB and the restoration of the community’s trust in IAB and \nSCPD—that persistent deficiencies are identified and addressed.  SCPD should continue to \nassess and improve the methods available for submitting a complaint, including by assessing \ntrends in the methods actually used by complainants, and the timing of those complaints, in order \nto identify processes that may not be accessible or well known. \n \n Related to the above concern, we urge SCPD to increase and improve its communication \nwith complainants outside the Department.  We are concerned that external complainants \ncontinue to receive little to no information about the progress of the investigations of their \ncomplaints, and in particular, little to no notice of and information about the resolution of those \ninvestigations.  Indeed, this concern was highlighted by SCPD’s own audit of IAB cases \ncompleted between July 1, 2015, and January 1, 2016, which identified a case in which the \ncomplainant did not recall ever speaking to an IAB investigator and had never been informed \nabout the resolution of the investigation of his complaint.  SCPD needs to develop and \nimplement a regular process for informing the complainant, and ideally, the community, about \nthe outcomes of its internal affairs investigations.  Furthermore, we renew our recommendation \nthat supervisors include appropriate complainant contact as one of the bases for their review of \ninvestigations—both for IAB’s review and for the chain of command above IAB.  See Second \nAssessment Report at 45.     \n \n20 | P age \n \n\n Finally, we recommend that SCPD and IAB continue to develop and expand upon their \nwork measuring and assessing trends in their internal affairs investigations.   We were pleased to \nsee, as evidenced by SCPD’s “IAB Patterns and Trends of Biased Policing 2015” Report, that \nSCPD has started to identify and assess trends in their internal investigations.  However, SCPD \nneeds to continue to develop and expand upon this assessment.  For example, we recommend \nthat SCPD and IAB look at trends over a longer time period than they have done to date and that \nthey measure and analyze the time periods between different stages in the life cycle of an internal \naffairs investigation.  SCPD and IAB should use this analysis to support the Department’s \nconsideration of the effectiveness of their investigations and law enforcement procedures, \noverall; for example, SCPD and IAB should consider looking at their internal affairs cases to \nconsider whether the use of body-worn cameras or dashboard cameras would have allowed for \nan easier or more effective resolution of the investigation.  We further note that this type of data \nanalysis may be complemented by the implementation of the traffic stop data analysis measures \ndiscussed in connection with the bias-free policing provisions of the Settlement Agreement, and \nrecommend that SCPD look for and consider ways in which these procedures may support one \nanother.  See Settlement Agreement at 6-7. \n \n2.   Investigating Misconduct \n \n  SCPD has made significant structural reforms to its IAB within the past year, including \nadding more and higher-ranking officers to its command structure, and modifying IAB’s \norganizational structure so that it is now composed of three teams of six investigators, each of \nwhich is led by a captain.  To the extent that these organizational changes speak to SCPD’s \ncommitment to enhancing the stature and credibility of IAB within SCPD and in the community, \nas we believe they do, we are encouraged by these changes.  Moreover, it is our expectation that \nthese structural changes will encourage earlier, more frequent, and more substantive supervisory \nreview of investigations, as well as more consultation and collaboration between investigators \nand their supervisors.  These are changes that were needed in IAB and that we expect will \nimprove both the quality and the timeliness of SCPD’s internal investigations.  \n \n Similarly, we were encouraged by the expressed commitments of the Police \nCommissioner, SCPD leadership, and the new command staff at IAB to reducing the backlog of \ncases handled by IAB.  It is our hope and expectation that their prioritization of enhancing IAB’s \nresources will send a message to the Department and to the community that officer \naccountability is a core value of SCPD.  Furthermore, we expect that the new IAB command \nstaff’s focus on reducing the clearing the backlog of cases will mean that many long-standing \ninvestigations will be resolved, and we hope that it will prompt IAB to develop measures for \nimproving the timeliness of future investigations. \n \n In addition, we were encouraged to find that IAB investigative officers are receiving \nspecialized training relating to conducting internal affairs investigations.  It is important not only \nto identify training opportunities for investigative officers, but also to create an environment in \nwhich officers feel that their supervisors actually support them receiving such training.  We were \nencouraged to find that both are happening with greater regularity than in the past.  At the same \ntime, we are concerned that sergeants, lieutenants, and other supervisors at the precinct level do \nnot receive specific training for how to conduct a misconduct investigation given the significant \nnumber of complaints that are assigned to the precinct for a chain of command investigation.  As \n21 | P age \n \n\nnoted above,  SCPD does not provide any specific, recurring training regarding supervisory \nduties.  While supervisory functions are a component of training delivered upon an officer’s \npromotion to sergeant, SCPD should strongly consider developing recurring training for \nsupervisors, with a component specifically dedicated to investigating allegations of misconduct.  \n \nWe continue to have serious concerns about the long time periods between the opening of \nan internal investigation and the final resolution of the investigation.  Although we are \nencouraged by SCPD’s and IAB’s stated commitment to reducing the backlog of cases, we did \nnot find that IAB had developed concrete plans for how to prevent such a backlog from \ndeveloping in the future.  As we have in our past Assessment Reports, we recommend, for \nexample, that IAB develop interim timelines for the progress of an investigation and institute a \nway of measuring their adherence to those timelines.  Similarly, we recommend that the new \nIAB command staff develop and implement case management guidelines, for example, to guide \ninvestigating officers in determining how to allocate their time between the investigations they \nare handling.  We are concerned, for example, that investigating officers may allow cases \nperceived as “easier” or less important to linger if and when they are assigned to investigate a \nhigher priority case.  IAB command staff needs to develop and implement procedures for dealing \nwith this situation if they hope to improve the timeliness of their investigations and prevent \nbacklogs from amassing in the future. \n \n Related to this concern, we renew our earlier recommendation that the IAB develop and \nimplement a method for tracking the progress of their investigations.  See Second Assessment \nReport at 44-46.  We are concerned that neither IAB command staff nor its investigating officers \nwere able to describe the time periods for IAB’s current investigations.  We believe that IAB \nshould have a process to determine how long each stage of an investigation takes, for example, \nbetween the assignment of an investigation to an investigating officer and the first supervisory \nreview of the investigation.  Moreover, IAB should have a means of identifying and assessing \nthese time periods for individual cases, for individual investigative officers, and for IAB as a \nwhole.  Without the development and implementation of such measures, we are concerned that \nIAB’s expressed commitment to reducing the backlog of its cases will not translate into \nimprovements to the timeliness of its investigations in the future. \n \nE.     COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \n \nVII. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Maintaining Community Relationships  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Community Liaison Officers \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) \nCompliance \n22 | P age \n \n\n   d.  Community Response Bureau  Partial Compliance \n   e.  Community Outreach  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial  \n   f.  Social media and notification systems \nCompliance \n \n It is clear that SCPD, and in particular, its Community Liaison Officers (“CLO”), \nCommunity Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) officers, and the command staff in its \nCommunity Response Bureau (“CRB”), has committed substantial time and energy into further \ndeveloping its community engagement programs over the past year.  These efforts have resulted \nin the expansion and improvement of the programs and services offered by SCPD to the \ncommunity, as well as improvements to the communication and collaboration between CLOs \nand COPE officers in different precincts and between CLOs and COPE officers and CRB.  \nNotwithstanding SCPD’s commendable efforts and improvements, we continue to have concerns \nabout the effectiveness of SCPD’s implementation of the community engagement provisions of \nthe Agreement, and we urge SCPD to heed our recommendations for expanding its community \nengagement efforts to reach throughout the Department and to access the more underserved parts \nof the Suffolk County community.   \n \n1.  Maintaining Community Relationships and Community Outreach \n \nWe recognize the new Suffolk County Police Commissioner, and the leadership of \nSCPD’s CRB, for their stated commitment to making community engagement a priority for \nSCPD, and for their efforts to meet with representatives of the community, including leaders of \nadvocacy groups and service providers working with the Latino community in Suffolk County.  \nIt is clear that the Police Commissioner and CRB have made it a priority to schedule regular \nmeetings with these community groups, and to have these meetings attended by high-ranking \nmembers of SCPD.     \n \n In addition, we note with approval that SCPD has implemented a survey of the \ncommunity, has conducted some analysis of the survey results, and, based on that analysis, has \nmade plans for revising the survey instrument and the method of distributing the survey.  The \ncommunity survey is an important means of soliciting feedback from the community, and \nanalysis of the survey results should serve as a key data point for SCPD in determining how to \nimprove its community engagement programs.  \n \n However, SCPD needs to think beyond its more traditional community engagement \nevents when mapping out its future plans for community engagement, in order to continue to \ndeepen the relationships and trust it is building with the community groups with which it is \nalready involved and to forge new relationships with parts of the community with which it has \nyet to connect.  For example, SCPD should meet with leaders of community groups to get their \ninput about what types of community events SCPD should be involved with, about geographic \nareas, organizations, or parts of the community that SCPD should develop relationships with, and \nabout how to staff and structure community events to encourage more robust and more \n23 | P age \n \n\nmeaningful participation from the community.  Toward the same ends, SCPD should consider \nconducting more outreach to the faith community and taking advantage of its existing School \nResource Officers to get new ideas about community engagement.   Although the development of \nthe community relations daily activity reporting system is a positive step, the Department needs \nto use this system in a more effective and accurate way.  As it stands, we have concerns that the \nsystem does not present an accurate or useful picture of how COPE officers and CLOs spend \ntheir time.  Rather than having officers account for a particular community engagement event as \na discrete event involving many different actions, for example, officers appear to be separately \naccounting for each action that they take relating to a particular community event.  This may lead \nto an artificially inflated description of the extent of a particular officer’s work, or even of \nSCPD’s community engagement work at the precinct or department level.  Having a more \nconsistent and accurate means of tracking officers’ community engagement work is an essential, \nand still missing, component of developing an effective community engagement program. \n \n Finally, we note that SCPD should continue with its plans to revise the community \nsurvey, and should further refine and improve its analysis and use of the survey results.  As \nSCPD acknowledged in its 2015 Community Relations Report, the survey instrument itself needs \nto be reformulated.  For example, because many of the questions in the current version of the \nsurvey yielded few or no substantive responses, SCPD should consider rewriting those questions, \nand revisiting how and where the survey is distributed.  In the same vein, as SCPD has \nacknowledged, the survey results strongly suggest that the survey is not reaching a significant \nproportion of the Latino or LEP populations in Suffolk County, and thus that SCPD is not yet \ngetting useful information from the survey about how it is working with these segments of the \npopulation.  SCPD thus needs to do more to get the survey to Latinos in the community, \nparticularly LEP individuals.  Indeed, our own assessment supports this finding from the survey:  \nit remains evident to us, for example, that additional outreach with Latino and LEP community \nadvocates is needed to ensure that they know about the compliment/complaint line and that they \nare informing their constituents to use it to provide feedback to SCPD.  SCPD has stated that it \nwill be reformulating and redistributing the report in 2016.  We look forward to seeing the \nrevised survey instrument and to hearing about the Department’s efforts to improve distribution \nof the survey instrument. \n \n2.  Community Liaison Officers, Community Oriented Policing Enforcement, and the \nCommunity Response Bureau  \n \n We recognize both that CLO and COPE officers in different precincts are now working \nmore closely with one another and that CLO and COPE officers are having more regular \ncommunication with their leadership in CRB.  This enhanced communication and collaboration \nrepresents a notable improvement from the past, when it seemed that CLO and COPE officers \nhad little to no familiarity with the community engagement programs in precincts outside of their \nown.  Ensuring effective communication promises to better enable precincts to share with one \nanother what they have learned about opportunities and challenges for developing and improving \ntheir own community engagement programs.  We note, for example, that the soccer program \norganized through the Police Athletic League in the Fifth Precinct—which  has, fairly, been held \nup to us as one of SCPD’s most successful community engagement programs—will  be \nreplicated in the First Precinct, with the support of CLO and COPE officers who organized the \nsoccer program in the Fifth Precinct.  This is a clear example of the benefit of having more \n24 | P age \n \n\nregular and more meaningful information sharing between CLO and COPE officers in different \nprecincts.  While we are encouraged by the progress in this area, we urge SCPD to continue to \nfoster this intradepartmental communication.       \n \nBeyond encouraging continued activities by and dialogue between its CLO and COPE \nofficers, SCPD needs to take affirmative steps to involve the entire Department in community \nengagement.   It is essential that community engagement be perceived as relevant to, and part of \nthe responsibility of, all police officers and command staff in SCPD—and it is the responsibility \nof the Police Commissioner, of SCPD leadership, and the CRB, to make sure that this culture \nchange takes place.  As it stands, SCPD continues to have its community engagement efforts \nhandled almost exclusively by its COPE officers and CLOs, and to have decisions about what \ncommunity engagement means for the Department determined by CRB.  Although command \nstaff and line officers attend community engagement programs, their involvement seems to be \nfairly minimal and to depend mostly on their individual availability and interest.  SCPD \nleadership and command staff need to take concrete, affirmative steps to get patrol and \ninvestigative units involved in community engagement programs.  For example, SCPD should \nencourage patrol officers to attend community events and make it clear that such activities are an \nintegral part of their law enforcement responsibilities. \n25 | P age \n ",

Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 \nEdwin Quinones, Esq. \nJohn Quinones, Esq. \nChristina Guerola Sarchio, Esq. \nMatthew Schwartz, CPA  Dear Mr. Kappelhoff and Mr. Campell: \nDebra M. Torres, Esq. \nJuan Manuel Trujillo, Esq. \nFrank Vasquez  This complaint, submitted on behalf of the Latino residents of \nElpidio (PO) Villarreal, Esq.  Suffolk County, New York, alleges that Suffolk County, whose law \nCid D. Wilson \nMauro M. Wolfe, Esq.  enforcement agencies receive federal funds, deprives Latinos equal access \nto those agencies, both by failing to adequately investigate crimes \ncommitted against Latinos by whites and by discouraging Latinos from \nCesar A. Perales  even seeking assistance from local law enforcement agencies in the first \nPresident & General Counsel  place.  The effect of this inadequate, discriminatory treatment has been to \nallow crimes against Latinos to flourish. \nAs a consequence, Latinos in Suffolk County now live in daily fear \nfor their physical well-being, victims of hate crimes at least on a weekly \nbasis.  During the week Marcelo Lucero was killed, there were five hate \ncrime incidents with eight victims, maybe more. On the street Latinos are \nregularly assaulted with racial taunts, beer bottles, slashed tires, and the \nthreat of physical assault.  Sometimes these crimes are particularly brutal \nand make headlines. More often, the crimes remain unsolved, far from the \npublic eye.  Tragically, the recent assault against Marcelo Lucero, in which \nLatinoJustice PRLDEF \n99 Hudson Street, 14th floor  the assailants surrounded him, taunted him, and then stabbed him, was fatal. \nNew York, NY 10013-2815 \nTel:  212 219 3360 \nFax: 212 431 4276 \n800 328 2322 \n\nThese anti-Latino hate crimes did not come into existence in a vacuum.  The gang of \nyoung men that attacked and murdered Mr. Lucero, simply because he was Latino, had long \noperated with impunity in its weekly rite of driving around the streets to find a Latino to beat up. \nThey had already attacked four other Latinos in two separate incidents that very same day.  Both \nincidents were reported to the police; after interviewing the victims, the officer effectively \nclosed the case concluding there was no further investigation, ignoring the glaring common \nthread between these and likely dozens of other reports:  an epidemic of hate crimes against \nLatinos had erupted in Suffolk County. \nThat this ongoing criminal activity had continued unabated month after month reflects \nthe Police Department's disparate, deficient treatment of requests for help by Latinos.  Two men \ncharged in the Lucero murder had actually been detained by police three days before after being \nidentified by a Latino who had been shot at by youths yelling racial epithets.  After questioning, \nthe police released the young men without filing charges or further investigation.  Had the police \ndone their job and arrested them, Marcelo Lucero might still be alive.  Sadly, this is just one \ninstance in a lengthy series of discriminatory actions depriving Latinos of equal access to law \nenforcement agencies and their services. \nThe actions, or inaction, of Suffolk County and its law enforcement agencies require \ninvestigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with respect to their discriminatory treatment \nof Latinos.  Similar patterns and practices by local law enforcement agencies have in the past \nwarranted DOJ investigations and, on occasion, the requirement that departments enter into \nagreements with DOJ to remedy discriminatory practices. \nI.  Legal Principles: The Duty to Protect Racial and Ethnic Minorities \nThe behavior of Suffolk County officials and its Police Department constitutes racial and \nnational origin discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n§2000d  and Section 809(c) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 \nU.S.C. 3789d(c)(3).  Suffolk County has a pattern and practice of administering justice that has \nthe effect of discriminating against Latinos, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 14141.  The Office of \nCivil Rights has investigated numerous local law enforcement agencies as a result of complaints \nof discriminatory administration of justice.  See, e.g., U.S. v. City of Columbus, Ohio, 99 CV \n1097 (S.D. Ohio, 2000) (King, Magistrate J.);  U.S. v. State ofNew Jersey, et al., 99 CV 5970 \n(D.NJ)(MLC). \nLocal law enforcement must provide services to all residents without discriminating on the \nbasis of race.  In Neighborhood Action Coalition v. City of Canton, Ohio, 882 F.2d 1012 (6th \nCir. 1989), the Sixth Circuit held that plaintiffs alleging discriminatory provision of police \nprotection had standing to sue pursuant to Title VI and other civil rights statutes.  As the facts \ndetailed herein make clear, Latinos do not have access to the police protection to which they are \nentitled.  Despite a rise in hate crimes against Latinos in the country as a whole and Long Island \nin particular, Suffolk County has failed to take steps that encourage reporting of hate crimes and \nhas failed to follow up on such reports when they are made.  In analogous circumstances, OCR \nhas alleged that a law enforcement agency's failure to create adequate complaint procedures \nviolates Title VI.  See, e.g.,  U.S. v.  City of Columbus, Ohio, 99 CV 1097 S.D. Ohio, 2000) \n\n(King, Magistrate J.) (alleging, in part, that failure to provide access to civilian complaint \nprocedures against the police violated Title VI). \nSuffolk County has failed to protect its Latino residents from injury by fellow Suffolk \nCounty residents.  It is well-settled that federal-funding recipients may be liable for failure to \nprotect constituents from injury by third parties.  In Davis v. Monroe County Board of' \nEducation, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), a parent successfully sued a school pursuant to Title IX for \nfailing to protect her daughter from student-on-student harassment.  The Supreme Court found \nthat funding recipients \"may be liable for their failure to respond to the discriminatory acts of \ncertain nonagents.\"  Davis at 643.  Like the federal funding recipients in Neighborhood Action \nCoalition and Davis, the Suffolk County Police Depart is obliged to protect its constituents in a \nnon-discriminatory manner.  It is the kind of behavior that has, in the past, warranted \ninvestigations of local police departments by the Department of Justice and, on occasion, the \nrequirement that departments enter into agreements with DOJ to remedy discriminatory \npractices. \nThe behavior of Suffolk County officials and its Police Department constitute  racial and \nnational origin discrimination in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nAccordingly, we ask that the Department of Justice undertake an immediate investigation into \nthis matter and take appropriate remedial action. \nIn the sections below, we elaborate upon the specific misconduct that warrants further \ninvestigation by the DOJ. \nII.  The Facts:  Suffolk County's Failure to Protect Its Latino Community. \nThere can be little disputing the notion that a police department cannot adequately protect a \nvulnerable community unless there exists sufficient trust so that community members are willing \nto report crimes committed against them.  To engender that trust, two things must happen: first, \npublic officials must consistently emphasize that discriminatory conduct towards any \ncommunity will not be tolerated, and, second, the police department must show that it is willing \nto investigate fully and fairly crimes reported to it by members of that community.  Suffolk \nCounty's public officials and its police have woefully failed their respective obligations. Public \nofficials have repeatedly inflamed public resentment against the Latino community, even after \nbrutal hate crimes had been committed against it, and the police have, until the Lucero murder, \nfailed to fully and fairly investigate crimes upon Latinos. As a result Latinos have suffered \nnumerous violent attacks at the hands of whites and the police response has been so inadequate \nthat some Latinos have seven topped reporting those assaults. \nA.  Suffolk County Leaders Have Repeatedly and Recklessly Expressed Hostility \nTowards Latinos_Even After Brutal Hate Crimes Had Been Committed Against \nThem. \nThe hostility towards Latinos on Long Island first gained national attention in 2000 when \ntwo Latino laborers were picked up by several white men in Farmingville posing as contractors \nwho then took them to an isolated location and beat the two laborers so severely that they were \n\nhospitalized for the extensive injuries they sustained. \nShortly thereafter in 2001, in a public hearing on a bill was proposed penalizing \ncontractors who hire undocumented workers, Suffolk County Legislator Michael D' Andre stated \nthat if his hometown was ever \"attacked\" by an influx of Hispanic day laborers as Farmingville \nhad: \n\"[W]e'll be up in arms; we'll be out with baseball bats.\" \nIn 2004 five high school students burned down of the home of a Latino family in the \nmiddle of the night.  The family, targeted for being Latino, might have been trapped upstairs and \nkilled but for being awakened by the sound of sirens outside.  The ringleader, angry over a \nth  carried  photos in his wallet.  Overall, in 2004 Suffolk County \n15  were  nst \nIn 2005 Stephen Levy took office after having campaigned on a promise to crack down \nLatino laborers.  Though local lawmakers regularly complained about immigration, Mr. Levy \nwent much further than most.  After his inauguration, Mr. Levy promoted five different anti \nimmigrant bills in the County legislature.  He quickly initiated an effort to deputize local police \nofficials as federal immigration agents so as to allow them to enforce federal immigration law. \nThis effort failed in part because of the opposition of police union.  As I am sure DOJ is aware, \npolice chiefs and police organizations across the country have opposed attempts to have local \npolice help enforce federal immigration laws because such efforts cut off communication with \nthe Latino community, discouraging victims from coming forward if they or any of their family \nare of uncertain immigration status, allowing crime to run rampant in that community. \nMr. Levy then had Suffolk County police play a prominent role in a discriminatory \nscheme in which certain homes occupied by Latinos were targeted for eviction of tenants \nwithout prior notice.  Ten homes in Farmingville, tenanted exclusively by Latinos, were subject \nto these unprecedented proceedings, apparently triggered by complaints from white neighbors. \nLandlords were not even given prior notice of the offending housing code violations upon which \nthe evictions were based.  Mr. Levy's own appointees, the Director of the Suffolk County Office \nof Minority Affairs and nearly half the members of his Hispanic Advisory Board, resigned in \nprotest of his handling of these evictions.  Lawyers from this office filed a federal complaint on \nbehalf of the evicted tenants to have these \"no notice\" evictions halted and obtained an order \nfrom a district court judge requiring Brookhaven Township to halt these evictions based upon a \nfinding that they violated the Fair Housing Act.  The Workplace Project, Inc. v. Town of \nBrookhaven, Civ. No.: 05-4323 (E.D.N.Y.) (IS). \nIn or about this same time, Mr. Levy initiated a number of policies and practices that \ndramatically increased the number of immigrants turned over to the federal government for \ndeportation. First, as a matter of policy, Suffolk County police would inquire into the \nimmigration status of anyone who was arrested, checking their names against a federal database. \nIn reality, Suffolk County police started the practice of inquiring and investigating the \nimmigration status of Latinos they came into contact with even if they were not being arrested, \nsuch as drivers and passengers of cars stopped by police for possible traffic violations.  These \nstops and inquiries occurred largely in and around Farmingville, where a great proportion of the \n\nLatinos in the County live. \nAt about the same time, he proposed anti-loitering legislation to prohibit these Latino \nlaborers from standing on side walks and street corners on county roads from soliciting \nemployment in Suffolk County.  Though this legislation never passed, he did then successfully \npropose legislation that required all business owners doing business with the county to verify the \nlawful immigration status of their employees, a move that he said would affect more than 6,000 \ncompanies.  Ironically, after having spent tens of thousands of dollars on this program and \nraiding 33 contractors, only one instance of an undocumented employee was ever indentified. \nHe also co-founded a national organization, called Mayors and Executives for Immigration \nReform, that allied itself with a number of anti-immigration organizations such as the so-called \nhate group FAIR (Federation for American Immigration Reform) and often appeared on Lou \nDobbs and other national media to promote these and other actions by local govemments. \nThe aim of these measures, Mr. Levy said, was to protect residents who \"do not want to \nsee their neighborhood tumed upside down.\"  Apparently, he presumes that someone without \nlawful immigration status is someone who destroys neighborhoods. \nOther County legislators also expressed great hostility towards Latinos.  In early 2007, \nCounty Legislator Elie Mystal referred to Latino laborers gathering to look for work in this way: \n\"If I'm living in a neighborhood and people are gathering like that, I would load my gun and start \nshooting, period. Nobody will say it, but I'm going to say it.\" \nMore recently, Legislator Jack Eddington- whose district includes Patchogue where \nMarcelo Lucero was murdered - singled out two speakers who wanted to use Spanish translators \nat a public hearing and demanded to know whether they were legal.  He also told undocumented \nimmigrants \"You better beware\" and that \"If you're here in Suffolk County illegally, you will \nnot stay here.\"  New York Times, March 1, 2007, Suffolk Plans a Crackdown on Laborers There \nIllegally, by Corey Kilgannon. \nThere can be no question but that these actions and statements by Suffolk County leaders \ncreate an atmosphere that discourages Latinos from reporting crimes committed against them \nand may even give encouragement to those tempted to commit such hate crimes against Latinos. \nAs Phil Ramos, a state assemblyman from the County, stated: \n\"The constant rhetoric coming from some elected officials has the impact of creating an \natmosphere in which a crime like this [murder of Marcelo Lucero] can occur. .... We need \nmature leadership in this county that doesn't pander to the worst qualities in our \nresidents.\" \nC.  Members of the Latino Community Are Continuously Subject to  Acts of \nViolence By Whites. \nAs noted above, crimes are regularly being committed against Latinos in Suffolk \nCounty. Further, as noted above, hate crimes are being committed against Latinos in \nSuffolk County on a weekly basis, despite Suffolk County's claim to the contrary.  The \n\nnow well-reported story of the gang of seven young men who murdered Marcelo Lucero \ndemonstrates this. \nThe District Attorney stated that these young men regularly engaged in what they \ncalled \"be::mer hopping\" and this was far from the first time that they, unprovoked, had \nassaulted innocent Latinos on the streets of Suffolk County.  As described in the New \nYork Times: \n\"The death of Marcelo Lucero, ... was the grim culmination of a violent, racially driven \npastime that seven local teenagers routinely engaged in called 'beaner hopping,' \nprosecutors told a court on Thursday .....  'To them, it was a sport,' Mr. Spota said in a \nnews conference after the defendants were arraigned. 'We know for sure that there are \nmore victims out there.\"' \n...  Around 5 a.m. on Nov. 8, two of the teenagers, Nicholas Hausch and Jordan Dasch, \nboth 17, drove around Patchogue armed with a BB gun. After spotting a Hispanic man in \na driveway, Mr. Hausch aimed the gun and fired, prosecutors said, hitting the man, \nMarlon Garcia, several times.  That evening, the two youths met up with five of their \nfriends- they knew each other from Patchogue-Medford High School  drank beer in \na park and then set off with the intention of hunting down, and hurting, Hispanic men. \nThey first drove around their hamlet of Medford, but, failing to find potential victims, set \noff for Patchogue, prosecutors said, an adjoining town that is more ethnically diverse. \nThere, they spotted another Hispanic man, Hector Sierra, walking on a downtown street \nand, according to prosecutors, jumped out of the car and surrounded Mr. Siena, who \nmanaged to escape. The youths drove off, and shortly before midnight, spotted Mr. \nLucero, who was walking along the street with his friend Angel Loja. The teenagers got \nout of their car, taunted the men using racist slurs and then started hitting them. \nNew York Times, Teenagers' Violent 'Sport' Led to Killing, Officials Say, November 11, 2008 \n(emphasis added).  Five days earlier, three of the defendants had gone out driving with the intent \nof \"beaner hopping\" and found a Latino man who they punched and knocked unconscious.  The \nvictim of that incident has not yet stepped forward. \nPerhaps most disturbing of all, one of the men stated to the police \"I don't go out and do \nthis very often, maybe once a week.\" \nOther news reports confirm the fact that Latinos are regularly assaulted on the streets of \nSuffolk County. \nLatinos say the attack against Mr. Lucero, if not his murder, was foretold. Some report \nbeing threatened and physically harassed in the streets, with bottles thrown at them and \ntheir car windows smashed during the night. Anti-immigrant epithets and racially \nmotivated bullying are common in the hallways of the schools, children say. \nNew York Times, November 14, 2008, A Killing in a Town Where Latinos Sense Hate, by Kirk \nSemple. \n\nOther reports confirm an ongoing pattern of anti-Latino hate crimes in the Patchogue \narea, according to Hispanic residents. \n\"These kids are coming here and harassing us more often,\" said one careworn, bike \nriding mourner from a neighborhood that seems less of a haven than it used to. Old \nenough to qualify for AARP membership, he disclosed that he is Salvadoran but refused \nto give his name \"because the kids see me around and know who I am.\" \n\"At night they throw rocks and bottles,\" he said. \"They heckle us and try to engage us; \nthey want a fight.\" Sometimes the kids do worse things. \"They slashed my tires outside \nthe library one afternoon. A lot of them carry knives. The ones who did this to Marcelo \nhad no compassion, no morals, no nothing.\" \nNew York Times, \"Long Island\" section, p. 1, November 24, 2008, Immigrants Say Slaying \nBrings Bias To The Fore, by Robin Finn. \nLocal elected officials also confirm that Latinos are regularly being assaulted and harassed. \nThe Mayor of Patchogue, Paul Ponteri, said he had just learned that Hispanic kitchen workers in \nhis town feared their trips home after work at night for fear of being assaulted.  Phil Ramos, a \nstate assemblyman, and Ricardo Montano, a county legislator, have stated that \"attacks and \nharassment of Hispanics are common.\"  Lastly, as detailed in the following section, there have \nbeen a number of hate crimes that took place in a section of Suffolk County, the East End \nsection, that do not get charged as hate crimes because of the inadequacies in the police's ability \nto investigate hate crimes. \nC.  Suffolk County Police Have Failed To Fully And Fairly Investigate Crimes Committed \nAgainst Latinos By Whites \nAs is evident above, substantial numbers of hate crimes being committed against Latinos \nthat are either not being reported to the police or are not being listed as hate crimes given that \nSuffolk County assert that there was only one hate crime committed against a Latino in all of \n2007.  A couple of the stories below, some well reported in the press, make clear that when \nLatinos have turned to the police to report crimes against them, thepolice have not conducted \nfull and fair investigation, which has the effect of making victims reluctant to report a crime in \nthe future. \nEast End.  About a year ago, a 17 year old nco-Nazi was aJTested in East Hampton for \nchasing a Latino high school student with a running chainsaw shouting anti-Latino slurs. The \npolice did not include a single hate crime charge among the charges.  The police asserted that \nthey could not file a hate crime charge against a minor.  This is false.  In addition to the murder \nand manslaughter charges filed last week, all seven men were charged with hate crimes even \nthough most of them were 16 or 17 years old. \nLuis Ochoa was attacked by a former policeman screaming racist epithets. The charges \nwere ultimately dropped as local police said there were not enough witnesses, even though the \nassault was witnessed by 12 members of the St. Theresa's Latino choir, some of whom in fact \n\npulled the 6' 4\" assailant off of Mr. Ochoa while he was kicking and pummeling Mr. Ochoa. Mr. \nOchoa suffered a split lip, bruising to his torso, and severe traumatic stress.  The hate crime \ncharges were dropped because the prosecutor stated there were not sufficient bodily harm. \nWe have been told that there are half a dozen other hate incidents that have occurred on \nthe East End section of Suffolk County that local authorities did not call in the Hate Crime \nInvestigations Unit of the Suffolk County police or otherwise file hate crime charges. \nApparently, Suffolk County Police by tradition do not investigate crimes on the East End. This \nleaves hate crime investigations to police who lack specialized training to investigate hate \ncrimes.  As evidenced by the six incidents above, the end result is that hate crimes are not \nadequately investigated or charged.  In fact, we are not aware of any anti-Latina hate crime \ncharges having been filed the past few years by the police on the East End. \nOne local Latino who wishes to remain anonymous reports the following experience. \nThis summer he was walking home from work, and a group of 10 or more white youths attacked \nhim in Patchogue. He tried to run away but the group, some of who were on bike surrounded \nhim, and punched/kicked him in face and body, leaving marks and bruises. They insulted him, \ntelling him to \"go home\" or back to where he came from. He eventually called 911 and \nuniformed Suffolk county police responded and took him to Patchogue Pet/office, where they \ninterviewed him and took photos of his injuries. At the time, no further action was taken. \nJoseph Hernandez.  Mr. Hernandez is a 50-year-old disabled Puerto Rican who has \nlimited use of his leg and whose left arm is paralyzed.  He has Jived in Huntington for a couple \nof years while attending Suffolk County Community College. Paul W. Shaunessy, age 52, \nmoved to his neighborhood in April, 2008, and has created problems for Mr. Hernandez and his \nother neighbors.  He had left a number of notes under Mr. Hernandez doorways about various \nissues and made offensive statements to Mr. Hernandez when he saw him on the street. \nOn Sunday Oct 19, Mr. Shaunessy came up the stairs and began banging on Mr. \nHernandez's door.  Mr. Hernandez opened the door to try to get him to stop.  He asked him to \nleave without any success.  Mr. Shaunessy became agitated and jumped on Mr. Hernandez and \nbegan to pull off his clothes (he was wearing pajamas) while squeezing his scrotum.  Mr. \nShaunessy even pulled Mr. Hernandez's undergarments off of him. \nAt one point, Mr. Hernandez was able to reach a fire extinguisher and struck him twice \nto try to get him off of him.  When he got him to stop, Mr. Shaunessy said \"Thank you.\"  At that \npoint, apparently two women who were passing on the street heard the commotion and called \n911.  When the police arrived, instead of taking Mr. Hernandez to the hospital they insisted on \ntaking him to the station because they said they wanted to \"get this guy.\" \nA Detective Michael Vopecelli began to interview him but then started to read Mr. \nHernandez his Miranda rights.  When Mr. Hernandez asked if he was being arrested, the \ndetective replied that they do this with all witnesses.  Then they said that they need him to sign a \nMiranda card before they continued.  He did so thinking that this was fine.  But then they \nhandcuffed him and began interrogating him. \n\nDuring the interrogation the Detective asked Mr. Hernandez: \"What are you?\" \nMr. Hernandez did not understand the question so he said, \"do you mean am I a citizen?\" \nThe Detective responded, \"No .... .I'm a WAP [a derogatory term for Italians].  What are you?\" \nHe explained that his parents were Puerto Rican.  The Detective then said, so you are a Puerto \nRican.  Then he was then taken to Central Islip and held in a cold cell for 14 hours.  When he \nwas taken to a second police station on Park A venue, the police there were apologetic and said \n\"we have nothing to do with this, it's up to the detective.\"  He said he was treated fine by all the \nother police officials involved except for the detective. \nThe police have refused to charge the neighbor. He recorded the attack on a tape recorder \nhe uses for school and is willing to provide a copy of that tape.  He is outraged by what \nhappened to him and believes that no one can turn to the Suffolk County police when they are \nattacked if they are Latino.  He has been afraid to return to his home since his neighbor attacked \nhim. \nConclusion \nFor the above reasons, we ask that the Department of Justice undertake an immediate \ninvestigation into this matter and take appropriate remedial action. We stand ready to assist the \nDepartment in any manner we can and would like to meet with the Department to discuss this \nmatter as soon as possible. \nSincerely, \nCesar A. Perales \nPresident and General Counsel ",

Since the beginning, SCPD has \nmaintained a collaborative and professional approach to the compliance process.  We appreciate \nthe cooperation and effort that SCPD and Suffolk County leadership have thus far put into \naddressing the requirements of the agreement.  The SCPD of today is different from the \ndepartment that we initially investigated, but there is still work to be done.  We and the \ncommunity look forward to seeing the improvements that are to come. \n \n  In the months since reaching agreement, the Civil Rights Division and United States \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York have conducted multiple compliance \nvisits, participated in numerous conference calls with SCPD, and provided technical assistance to \nSCPD, including direct access to DOJ consultants, on a broad range of compliance topics.  \nTechnical assistance has helped SCPD to increase capacities in a variety of areas, and although \nwe expect that the collaborative process will continue as we move forward, the provision of \ntechnical assistance will lessen as we shift to the next level of compliance review.  DOJ’s role \nwill now shift more substantially to assessment of compliance with agreement requirements. \n \n  In the attached table, we provide a compliance rating and comments for each provision of \nthe agreement.  The definition of each rating type is as follows: \n \n•  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement. (15 provisions) \n•  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.  \n(50 provisions)   \n \n \n\n \n•  “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement. (5 provisions) \n•  “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation. (7 provisions) \n \n  Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.  We look forward to \nreturning to Suffolk County soon to continue the process.  \n \n \n        Sincerely, \n \n \nJUDITH PRESTON          KELLY T.

Since the last Compliance Status Assessment Report, the Civil \nRights Division and United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York have \nreviewed documentation of police operations, met with community stakeholders, held conference \ncalls with SCPD, and conducted a compliance tour with subject matter experts during the week \nof September 21, 2015.  We appreciate the cooperation and effort that SCPD and Suffolk County \nleadership continue to show in addressing the requirements of the Agreement.  \n \n  In the attached Compliance Status Assessment Report, we provide a compliance rating \nand comments for each provision of the Agreement.  The definition of each rating type is as \nfollows: \n \t  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement. (14 provisions) \n \t  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.  \n(55 provisions) \n   “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement.  (4 provisions) \n   “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation.  (4 provisions) \n \nSCPD continues to make progress in meeting many of the requirements of the \nAgreement.  By all accounts, SCPD has given new life to the Community Liaison Officer (CLO) \nand Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (COPE) programs in its precincts.  At the same  \n \n \n\n \ntime, SCPD must take significant and immediate steps to address other aspects of \nimplementation.  Please see our comments in the Compliance Status Assessment Report for \nfurther details about these areas. \n \n  Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.  We look forward to \nreturning to Suffolk County soon to continue the process.  \n \n \n       Sincerely,   \n \n \nJUDITH PRESTON          ROBERT L.

SCPD will continue to deliver police services that are equitable, respectful, and \nfree of unlawful bias, in a manner that promotes broad community engagement and \nconfidence in the Department. In conducting its activities, SCPD will ensure that \nmembers of the public receive equal protection of the law, without bias based on \nrace, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation, and in \naccordance with the rights, privileges, and immunities secured or protected by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD continues to take steps towards compliance with this provision and is \nAnalysis \nfinalizing a strong set of policies governing bias-free policing.  SCPD has \ndesigned and begun delivering training in this area, but the training requires \nimmediate and significant revision, described below.  SCPD has started to lay \na foundation for accountability in this area by adopting a data collection \npolicy for traffic stops and devoting heightened attention to review of biased-\npolicing complaints. However, improvements are necessary in the processing \nof internal misconduct investigations, and the collection and analysis of traffic \nstop data need to be conducted in a manner that ensures reliability.   \n \nb. Policies and Procedures \ni. SCPD will maintain implementation of a comprehensive policy prohibiting \ndiscrimination, including the denial of services, on the basis of race, color, \nethnicity, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation in SCPD police \npractices. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nSCPD submitted a proposed policy for this provision, designated as Chapter 1, \nSection 11 of its Rules & Procedures (R&P 1.11).  See Suffolk County Police \nDepartment Compliance Report, Aug. 1, 2015 (hereinafter “SCPD Self-\nReport”), Attachment 1.  We recommend that SCPD implement Chapter 1, \nSection 11 as presented to the United States in August 2015.   \n \nThe proposed policy improves upon previous proposals, particularly in the \nfollowing areas: \n   Dedication of a stand-alone policy that unequivocally prohibits biased \npolicing in all forms; \n   R&P 1.11 retains strengths of previous SCPD directives on bias-free \npolicing, including the focus on equitable treatment for all individuals and \nemphasis on the importance of building community trust; \n   R&P 1.11 prohibits the use of relevant characteristics in policing except \nwhen identifying a particular suspect; \n   Members who become aware of biased policing are required to \n3 | P a g e  \n \n\nimmediately report the matter to a supervisor, who must convey the \ninformation to Internal Affairs; and  \n   R&P 1.11 sets forth directives for members to follow at each stage of a \nlaw-enforcement encounter. \n \nAlthough R&P 1.11 is better than previous directives, there is room for \nimprovement.  For example, in R&P 1.11.VI.A., the word “shall” is preferable \nto “should,” and more consistent with the requirements that precede that \nparagraph in the section. The importance of this policy to the organization \nand community favors the more prescriptive wording in this paragraph.  The \nactions detailed in this section impact the perception of the individual \ncontacted by the SCPD.  As such, the organization should not leave it to the \npatrol officer to decide if they will follow the procedure as outlined in the \npolicy document. \n \nTraining on the Policy \nSCPD arrived at an acceptable policy in August 2015 and must now train all \nSCPD members on the policy’s requirements.  SCPD’s current training on \nbias-free policing does not appropriately teach members how to apply the \npolicy and must be modified to do so.  A more detailed assessment follows in \nour analysis corresponding to Paragraph III(d)(i).   \n \nImplementation of Bias-Free Policing Policy \nOur analysis of the implementation of the bias-free policing policy is tied to \nour analyses regarding implementation of the other requirements in this \nsection and our review of SCPD’s compliance under Paragraph VI(b)(vi) of \nthe Agreement, infra. \n \nSCPD has identified flaws in its procedures for collecting traffic stop data that \nrendered the collected data unreliable since at least January 2015.  As \nexplained in our Analysis related to Paragraph III(c), several factors \napparently contributed to this outcome: 1) a glitch in SCPD’s data collection \nsoftware, and 2) failures in SCPD’s measures for reviewing data entries for \naccuracy and completeness.  Historically, incomplete stop data entries were \ntracked and referred to supervisors for follow-up.  However, the problems \nnoted above caused incomplete entries to go unnoticed by patrol officers and \nsupervisors for nine months.1  As a result, SCPD lacks data that would enable \nthe agency to reliably measure its performance in this area.   \n \nRecommendations \nSCPD must take steps to ensure accurate data collection.  Additionally, SCPD \nshould identify and apply a suitable benchmark for analyzing the traffic stop \ndata, which we understand SCPD is currently attempting to do.  Finally, \n                                                            \n1 A Sergeant in  the Chief of Patrol’s office  was taking steps to correct the issues and  review the backlog  of  \nincomplete data entries when the United  States met with SCPD in September 2015. \n4 | P a g e  \n \n\nimplementation of its bias-free policing policies will require SCPD to \nintegrate analysis of the traffic stop data into SCPD’s accountability \nmechanisms.   \n \nii. SCPD’s policy on bias-free policing will prohibit officers from using race, \ncolor, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation in conducting \nstops or detentions, or activities following stops or detentions, except when \nengaging in appropriate suspect-specific activity to identify a particular \nperson or persons. \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nThe draft R&P 1.11 prohibits officers from “us[ing] race, ethnicity, national \nAnalysis \norigin, age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity when \nengaging in routine or spontaneous law enforcement activities, except when \nengaging in appropriate suspect-specific activity to identify a particular person \nor persons.” “Routine or spontaneous law enforcement activities” includes a \nrange of enforcement activities: vehicle and pedestrian stops, searches, frisks, \ndetentions, arrests, and issuance of summonses.   \n \nThis policy should be finalized and implemented immediately to ensure \ncompliance.  \n \niii. SCPD policy will require that, within five days of receipt, SCPD will refer \nany complaint of discriminatory policing to IAB for a full investigation.  \nThroughout the pendency of this Agreement, SCPD will also send a copy of \nany such complaint and material documenting the resulting investigation to \nthe United States within five business days upon completion of the \ninvestigation. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis  Although SCPD issued a Department Memorandum consistent with this \nparagraph on April 4, 2014, the agency must still establish the contents of the \n \nMemorandum as policy.  In order to do this, SCPD has drafted R&P 5.2 to \ncodify the requirements of this paragraph.  We reviewed SCPD’s complaint \ninvestigation files to determine whether the requirements have been \nimplemented in practice.  \nForwarding Complaints to IAB Within Five Days.  For most cases forwarded to \nthe United States during this reporting period, IAB received notice within five \ndays of SCPD’s receipt of the complaint, or shortly thereafter.  In one \ninvestigative file, however, it appears that more than a month passed between \nthe time that SCPD received notice of the complaint and the time that IAB \nreceived the referral. See Case #14-582i. In another case where SCPD \napparently received correspondence on four separate occasions regarding the \n5 | P a g e  \n \n\nsame allegation, only the fourth correspondence – which came more than five \ndays after the first correspondence – actually triggered the opening of an \nSCPD internal investigation. See Case #15-0002i. \n \nForwarding Completed Investigations to the United States within Five Days. \nSCPD consistently forwards investigations into allegations of biased policing \nto the United States within five days of the Commissioner’s review, or within \na reasonable time thereafter.   \nNotwithstanding, several disturbing patterns in the conduct of internal affairs \ncases have come to light during this reporting period.  First, there are troubling \ndelays in the completion of supervisory review of IAB investigations.  In one \nrecent case, more than a calendar year elapsed after the investigator submitted \nher findings before the Commissioner acknowledged concurrence with these \nfindings.  See infra Case #13-227i. While some cases have proceeded in a \ntimely manner, delays that leave the complainant, accused officer, and the \nDepartment without a resolution for an extended period can affect the actual \nand perceived integrity of the investigative process.  \nThe delay in completing supervisory review is compounded by a second \nproblem: IAB investigations themselves take an extraordinarily long time.  It \nis common for SCPD’s peer agencies to complete investigations in less than \n180 days, from the lodging of a complaint to issuance of the department’s final \nfindings.  However, for example, 869 days elapsed between the filing of \ncomplaint #13-227i and SCPD’s determination, with 184 days of that period \nelapsing after IAB presented its findings to the Commissioner.  IAB had the \ncomplaint for nearly two calendar years before finalizing its determination.  \nThis is inconsistent with industry practice and SCPD policy and, if left to \ncontinue, could negatively affect efforts to build community trust.  \nSCPD has started to address these concerns by implementing a tracking \npractice that will require IAB investigators to record the dates and times at \nwhich they complete steps in the investigative process, including interviewing \nthe complainant, interviewing witness officers, etc.  See Analysis re Paragraph \nVI(b)(iv), infra (discussing ‘Case Notes Overview’ sheet).  IAB supervisors \nwill periodically review these tracking sheets with the intention of ensuring \nthat the necessary investigative steps are taken.  To its credit, SCPD allocated \na net of two additional investigators to IAB during this reporting period.  \nBelow is a table describing implementation of this Paragraph of the \nAgreement for cases completed since January 14, 2015.  For each complaint, \nthe table provides two chronologies: first, the time elapsed between the \nmoment that SCPD received the complaint until the moment the complaint \nwas forwarded to IAB; second, the amount of time required to complete \nreview of the investigative findings once IAB completed its investigation.  \n \n \n6 | P a g e  \n \n\nComplaint:  Timing of Referrals  \n \n#14-565i  From initial SCPD notice to IAB referral: \n     8/16/14: Complaint lodged with SCPD \n     8/21/14: Investigation opened by IAB \n  From completion of investigation to delivery to DOJ:  \n     4/23/15: IAB investigator submitted findings  \n \n   5/6/15: IAB Captain concurred with findings \n \n   9/4/15: Commissioner concurred with findings \n   9/10/15: Investigation forwarded to the DOJ \n#13-227i  From initial SCPD notice to IAB referral:  \n     4/18/13: Complaint lodged with SCPD \n   4/19/13: SCPD referred complaint to IAB \nFrom completion of investigation to delivery to DOJ:  \n   7/14/14: IAB investigator submitted findings \n   3/4/15: IAB commanding officer concurred \n   9/4/15: Commissioner concurred with findings  \n   9/9/15: Investigation forwarded to the DOJ \n#14-309i  From initial SCPD notice to IAB referral: \n     4/30/14: Complainant contacted IAB directly  \nFrom conclusion of investigation to delivery to DOJ:  \n   12/8/14: IAB investigator submitted findings  \n   12/15/14: IAB commanding officer concurred \n   3/31/15: Commissioner concurred with findings  \n   4/1/15: Investigation forwarded to DOJ \n#14-128i  From initial SCPD notice to IAB referral: \n     2/25/14: Complainant contacted IAB directly  \nFrom conclusion of investigation to delivery to DOJ:  \n   2/17/15: IAB investigator submitted findings  \n   2/23/15: IAB commanding officer concurred \n   3/30/15 (approx.): Commissioner concurred \n   4/1/15: Investigation forwarded to DOJ \n#14-582i  From  initial SCPD notice to IAB referral:  \n   7/10/14: Complainant sent complaint to SCPD by  \ncertified mail \n   8/22/14: IAB opens investigation \nFrom conclusion of investigation to delivery to DOJ:  \n   2/25/15: IAB investigator submitted findings  \n   3/3/15: IAB commanding officer concurred \n   3/30/15: Commissioner concurred with findings \n   4/1/15: Investigation forwarded to DOJ \n#12-499i  From  initial SCPD notice to IAB referral:  \n   6/26/12: Complaint lodged with SCPD (does not \nallege discrimination) \n   7/2/12: IAB receives complaint \n7 | P a g e  \n \n\n   10/21/13: Civil complaint filed against SCPD \nalleging profiling  \n   10/21/13: Civil complaint forwarded to IAB2  \nFrom conclusion of investigation to delivery to DOJ:  \n   12/4/14: IAB investigator submitted findings  \n   12/8/14: IAB commanding officer concurred  \n   2/20/15 (approx.): Commissioner concurred \n   3/4/15: Investigation forwarded to DOJ \n#14-155i  From  initial SCPD notice to IAB referral:  \n   2/27/14:  Letter from Suffolk County Human Rights \nCommission  \n   3/4/14: Date IAB marks letter received \nFrom conclusion of investigation to delivery to DOJ:  \n   11/22/14: IAB investigator submitted findings  \n   12/9/14: IAB commanding officer concurred \n   2/20/15 (approx.): Commissioner concurred \n   2/20/15: Investigation forwarded to DOJ  \nRecommendations \nDuring our past two compliance visits, the United States’ consultant  \nrecommended that SCPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau implement a log system  \nfor recording dates and times of steps in the investigative process, including \nwhen the complaint is assigned for investigation, when the investigation is \ncompleted, when each supervisor receives the investigative findings for \nreview, and when each supervisor subsequently forwards the case for \nadditional review (or sends the case back for further investigation).  We again \nmake this recommendation and reiterate the importance of having an effective \ntracking mechanism to ensure the timely resolution of investigations.   \n \niv. SCPD officers who are found to have engaged in discriminatory policing \nwill be subjected to disciplinary action and, where appropriate, will be \nreferred for possible criminal prosecution.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nThe United States did not identify any investigations during this reporting \nAnalysis \nperiod in which an officer engaged in discriminatory policing but was not \ndisciplined or referred for possible criminal prosecution.   \n \nSCPD is still in the early stages of implementing processes to assess officer \n                                                            \n2 Case files often do not clearly document when a notice of claim or civil summons and complaint are served  on the \nagency, as in this case.  Here, one document in the file contains a handwritten note that the summons and complaint \nwere served  on SCPD on  October 21, 2013;  however, the file also contains an interoffice memorandum circulating  \nthe summons and complaint on  October 16, 2013. \n8 | P a g e  \n \n\nactivity for possible bias.  As noted above, SCPD still needs to implement a \nreliable traffic stop data collection program.  This program, when operational \nand integrated into SCPD’s accountability systems, will provide one backstop \nagainst unlawful profiling.  It is critical that SCPD take immediate steps to \nbring this program into compliance. \n \nAdditionally, SCPD has only recently taken steps to ensure that IAB \ninvestigators adequately document and follow routine investigative \nprocedures. SCPD is in the process of implementing a field training program  \nto help IAB investigators hone their skills.  See Analysis re Paragraph \nVI(b)(ii), infra. \n \nv. SCPD will maintain and implement a policy that promotes bias-free \npolicing and equal protection within its hiring, promotion, and performance \nassessment processes. Officers who have a history of engaging in biased \npolicing practices will not be entitled to promotional opportunities, except as \nrequired by collective bargaining laws and Civil Service Laws, rules and \nregulations. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nRecruitment and Hiring \nAnalysis \nSCPD draft policy R&P 26.1 states that, “All recruitment efforts will focus on \nproviding equal opportunity for all applicants,” irrespective of membership in \na protected class “or any other factor not directly related to job performance.”  \nSee SCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, Att. 4.  “Officers are assigned to the \nRecruitment Section at the discretion of the Commanding Officer of the \nCommunity Relations Bureau.”  Id.  The policy also directs officers to, inter \nalia, “maintain positive and productive relationships with community leaders, \neducational  institutions  and  religious  organizations”  and  make  continuous \nefforts to “recruit eligible applicants at high schools and colleges.”  Id.    \n \nOn August 24, 2015, SCPD issued Applicant Investigations Command \nGeneral Order 15-01 prohibiting the hiring of any candidate who “has \ncommitted any discriminatory act or … evinces a biased perspective based \nupon race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation that \nindicates such candidate is not be able [sic] to perform the duties of police \nofficer in a non-discriminatory manner.”  The Order also directs members of \nthe Applicant Investigation Section “who obtain any information concerning a \npossible discriminatory act committed by a candidate, and/or discover a \nbiased perspective … to notify the [Section’s] Commanding Officer,” who \nwill ensure a thorough investigation of the issues to assess the candidate’s \nfitness.   \n \nAlthough R&P 26.1 and Command General Order 15-01 appear strong in \nmany respects, we recommend the following modifications.  First, R&P 26.1 \n9 | P a g e  \n \n\nand its overall recruitment yields may be improved by memorializing SCPD’s \ncommitment to increasing awareness in all communities about its application \nprocess (not only increased access). Second, the Recruitment Section should \nreflect the diversity of SCPD’s force more broadly, and the policy should \ncommit to such diversity (notwithstanding the CRB Director’s discretion).  \nThird, while the policy’s directive to maintain good relationships with \ncommunity institutions and to recruit through educational institutions is \nimportant, this would be strengthened by directing officers to undertake these \nefforts in diverse communities. Finally, the policy should require the CRB \nDirector to maintain a list of institutions (community-based organizations, \nclergy, etc.) that have been helpful in fostering equal awareness about SCPD’s \nentrance process, and to consult these groups to ensure awareness of the \nrecruitment process.   \n \nThe Applicant Investigations Command General Order on investigating bias \nagainst employment candidates should, at the next possible review, be \namended as follows: \n   SCPD should add “gender” and other classes protected under State and \nlocal law to the list of prohibited biases; and, \n   SCPD should direct the Applicant Investigation Section to make \nspecific, affirmative inquiries to assess each candidate’s history of \nbiased acts and biased views (as it stands, the draft Command General \nOrder only requires that investigators report biases that come up in the \nprocess by happenstance). \n \nWe encourage SCPD to provide evidence of implementation of the Applicant \nInvestigations Command General Order when SCPD provides its next Self-\nReport in January 2016. This can be provided under separate cover, to \npreserve any confidential or personal identifying information. \n \nPerformance Assessments \nSCPD policy provides for two routine measures that SCPD proposes will \nidentify biased policing practices. First, patrol supervisors in precincts, the \nMarine Bureau, and the Highway Patrol Bureau are directed to hold monthly \nindividual meetings with patrol officers to review the officers’ respective \nMonthly Activity Reports. See R&P 10.3.VI.B.7. Second, supervisory \npersonnel from sergeants to precinct Commanding Officers, and the Chief of \nPatrol’s office, review traffic stop entries and data for erratic trends and \npotential biased policing. See R&P 10.3.VI.B.13; R&P 13.9.VI.C. \n \nThe first measure may improve the quality of SCPD’s traffic patrol generally, \nbut additional information is needed to determine specifically how this \nprocess is being used to identify possible biased policing.  Now that SCPD \nhas a means for identifying incomplete traffic stop entries, SCPD should be \nconducting this review.  The second measure appears, on its face, to be a \nhelpful backstop against biased policing.  Supervisors at all levels should \nreview traffic stop data to identify concerning enforcement patterns.  This \n10 | P a g e  \n \n\nprocess also depends upon reliable traffic stop data.  Random audits could \nalso provide SCPD with helpful information.  We look forward to conducting \non-site observations of these reviews during the next reporting period.   \n \nPromotions \nRegardless of how SCPD identifies biased policing, the Agreement requires \nthat evidence of such conduct disqualify officers from promotional \nopportunities, except as required by collective bargaining and civil service \nlaws. SCPD has incorporated this language into policy.  See R&P 17.2.III.C. \n \nImplementation \nSCPD needs to provide evidence that it is conducting the investigations, \nreviews, and screenings targeting a history of bias and/or biased policing, and \nthat equal protection measures are being enforced. \n \nvi. SCPD will implement a revised Chapter 16, Section 4, “Arrest of Non-US \nCitizens and Persons with Dual Citizenship,” as approved by the United \nStates. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nText of the Policy \nAnalysis \nSCPD has issued a revised policy regarding arrest of non-US citizens and \npersons with dual citizenship.3  The United States does not object to the \nrevised language of the policy. \n \nImplementation of the Policy \nImplementation of this policy requires assessments of members’ compliance.  \nSCPD proposes to amend R&P 16.4 to require officers to use the Arrest \nWorksheet to describe any consular notifications  that occur.  See SCPD Self-\nReport, Aug. 2015, at 8. Provided that SCPD unequivocally directs its \nmembers not to interpret the additions to the Arrest Worksheet as a reason or \nexcuse to inquire into immigration status, this proposal may be appropriate.  \nWe look forward to reviewing the draft policy. \n \nSCPD needs to develop mechanisms for assessing whether members have \ninquired into immigration status in violation of policy.  \n \nvii. Six months after the Effective Date and every six months thereafter \nthroughout the pendency of this Agreement, SCPD will provide to the United \nStates a report showing civilian complaints regarding police services related \nto allegations of discrimination and biased policing, noting the disposition of \neach complaint, if any, the geographic area in which the alleged \n                                                            \n3  See http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/documents/16-4.pdf.   \n11 | P a g e  \n \n\ndiscrimination occurred, the demographic category involved, and what \nmeasures, if any, SCPD will take as a result of the analysis.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD has provided the reports related to Paragraph III(b)(vii).  Each report \nAnalysis \nnoted few citizen complaints, which were dispersed among a number of \nSCPD precincts and involved complainants from diverse demographic \nbackgrounds. SCPD reported no trends or pattern. See SCPD Self-Report, \nJan. 2015, Att. 11; SCPD Self-Report, Jul. 2014, at 7-8.  In its most recent \nreport, SCPD stated that the complaint information “revealed no pattern and \nno two complaints involved the same officer.”  SCPD Self-Report, Jul. 2015, \nAtt. 6. Although this was consistent with the records that we reviewed, \nSCPD’s reports need to provide more detailed information about the \ncomplaints.  At the United States’ request, the August 2015 civilian complaint \nreport described the nature of each of the complaints in more detail than the \nreport in January 2015. However, the level of detail in the report was still \ninconsistent with the requirements of this provision.  \n \nRecommendations \nFuture reports should contain, in addition to the information supplied during \nthis reporting period: \n   The IAPro summary of the complaint; and  \n   Appropriate historical information about allegations/sustained \ncomplaints of biased policing relevant to the officer, the locality, the \nalleged victim, and/or the victim’s demographic. \n \n c. Traffic Stop Data \ni.  SCPD will implement a revised Chapter 13, Section 9, “Traffic Stop Data \nCollection,” as approved by the United States. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nSCPD implemented the “Traffic Stop Data Collection” policy approved by the \nUnited States. Subsequently, SCPD revised this policy to supplement existing \nsupervisory reviews of traffic stop data with the following requirement: \nThe Office of the Chief of Patrol will conduct monthly audits of \nT-Stop data. Incomplete or atypical traffic stops and/or \nenforcement activity identified will be referred to a precinct or \nbureau commanding officer for investigation.  Evidence of racial \nprofiling or bias based policing will be referred directly to the  \nInternal Affairs Bureau for investigation.  \nThe United States approves of this additional language.   \n \nImplementation \nSCPD has not satisfactorily implemented the “Traffic Stop Data Collection” \n12 | P a g e  \n \n\npolicy as required. As noted above, a computer glitch prevented users of the \ntraffic stop data software program from identifying incomplete entries.  The \npatrol officers who entered the incomplete data, the Patrol Sergeants and  \nLieutenants charged with monitoring traffic stop data for incomplete entries, \nand the Chief of Patrol charged with auditing traffic stop data failed to \nidentify and remedy this problem in a timely manner.  As a result, SCPD had \napproximately 7,748 incomplete traffic stop data entries during the months of \nJanuary – August 2015.  The traffic stop data SCPD has collected since at \nleast the outset of 2015 – and possibly before then – is likely unreliable in \nidentifying problematic trends in traffic stops.   \n \nAt the time of the United States’ on-site visit in late September, SCPD was \ntaking steps to ensure that incomplete traffic stop data entries would be \nidentified and addressed in the manner required by policy.  Specifically, the \nChief of Patrol’s office was drafting a memorandum to distribute Department-\nwide outlining the specific software function(s) that patrol supervisors could \nreliably use to identify patrol officers’ incomplete entries.  This seems like an \nappropriate first step. \n \nPersonnel accustomed to searching for incomplete traffic stop entries via one \nmethod may require brief trainings and/or supervision to ensure that a new \nmethod is adopted wholesale.  SCPD should monitor the situation carefully \nand deploy any necessary resources to ensure that the entries are being \ncompleted going forward.  Many of the supervisory reviews required by R&P \n13.9 would benefit from this type of monitoring. \n \nR&P 13.9 requires that SCPD apply appropriate benchmarks to the data.  The \nUnited States will work with SCPD to identify appropriate benchmarks and \nbegin to integrate them into SCPD’s traffic stop data collection program going \nforward. \n \nRecommendations  \nGiven the scale of SCPD’s problems implementing the traffic stop data \ncollection program under the Agreement, semiannual updates are insufficient \nto ensure compliance.  We recommend that SCPD’s Chief of Patrol Office \nregularly send the United States brief summaries of each precinct’s (a) \ncomplete traffic stop entries, (b) incomplete traffic stop entries, (c) remedial \nmeasures required to implement the policy, and (d) any anticipated remedial \nmeasures.  We request monthly summaries for December 2015 through March \n2016, and quarterly thereafter. \n \nii. One year after the Effective Date and annually thereafter throughout the \npendency of this Agreement, SCPD will provide to the United States a report \nanalyzing the collected traffic stop data and explaining what measures, if \nany, SCPD will take as a result of the analysis.    \n13 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD submitted a report pursuant to this requirement in its August 2015 Self-\nAnalysis \nReport. However, the report was based upon the aforementioned unreliable data \nset. Accordingly, the report does not reliably reflect SCPD’s traffic stop \nactivity. SCPD also needs to modify its benchmarking methods to accurately \nassess its enforcement patterns.  \n \nThe traffic stop report, albeit based on flawed data, reached troubling \nconclusions about SCPD traffic stop practices.  Should future reports indicate the \nsame trends, we will expect SCPD to produce an exacting plan about how to \ncorrect these problems.  SCPD should immediately begin to address this issue, \nshould it be substantiated in the next report.  \n \n d. Training on bias-free policing \ni. SCPD will ensure that all sworn officers receive training on bias-free \npolicing at least annually.  SCPD’s training on bias-free policing will \nemphasize that discriminatory policing, in the form of either selective \nenforcement or non-enforcement of the law, including the selecting or \nrejecting of particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited by policy \nand will subject officers to disciplinary action.  The training curriculum will \naddress: \n1. Methods and strategies for more effective policing that relies upon non-\ndiscriminatory factors; \n2. Police and community perspectives related to discriminatory policing; \n3. Constitutional and other legal requirements related to equal protection \nand unlawful discrimination; \n4. The protection of civil rights as a central part of the police mission and \nas essential to effective policing; \n 5. The existence and impact of arbitrary classifications, stereotyping, and \nimplicit bias; \n6. Identification of key decision points where prohibited discrimination \ncan take effect at both the incident and strategic-planning levels; and \n7. Methods, strategies, and techniques to reduce misunderstanding, \nconflict, and complaints due to perceived bias or discrimination, including \nproblem-oriented policing strategies. \nStatus  Noncompliance \nSCPD has developed a curriculum to instruct officers on bias-free policing, \nAnalysis \nand began classroom instruction in September 2015.  SCPD’s current bias-\nfree policing curriculum represents a substantial upgrade over previous \nversions shared with the United States.  Notwithstanding those improvements, \n14 | P a g e  \n \n\nboth the pedagogical approach to teaching this subject and the substantive \ninformation provided require additional substantial revisions. \n \nPedagogically, the curriculum superficially includes most of the necessary  \nstructural elements for a satisfactory adult learning course that the previous \ndrafts lacked. The curriculum now (1) identifies learning objectives; (2) \nconveys notes to the instructor (critical for any hope that future presenters \nmay be able to teach this subject); (3) features visual aids, including power \npoint slides and video clips; and (4) requires a post-test.  Discreet elements of \nthe current training hold promise, including the use of videos to illustrate \npolicing techniques. \n \nHowever, critical aspects of an effective training are lacking.  The course is \nprimarily lecture-based and lacks true interactive features.  This is not an \neffective means to communicate the essential elements of the topic, and leads \nto a lack of student engagement.  The training should combine lecture with \ninteractive features in small groups.  For example, participants could be \nbroken into small groups, given a scenario and a copy of the policy and then \nasked, after discussion within the group (with structure provided by a few \nframing questions), to report out about how they would handle the situation \ndescribed in the scenario.  Further, the scenarios describing discriminatory \npolicing conduct that are used during the course require additional detail to \nencourage students to engage in robust discussion.  The discussion would also \nbe enhanced by asking questions of participants before the fact patterns are \ndescribed, to focus participants on key issues. \n \nEven more than the pedagogy, however, the substantive treatment of the \nsubject tended to obscure, avoid and even undermine the intent of the training. \nFor example, the class commenced by discussing, generally, the legal \nprohibitions on biased policing. However, rather than directly stating that \ndiscrimination based upon impermissible characteristics violates an \nindividual’s constitutional rights, the instructor framed the discussion of \ndiscriminatory policing as an issue under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, \nwhich prohibits entities that receive federal funds from discriminating.  This \nmischaracterizes officers’ obligations  and reduces the importance of bias-free \npolicing. A subsequent discussion of constitutional requirements and law \nenforcement, including “equal protection” under the Fourteenth Amendment, \nfailed to demonstrate any intersection with police officers’ responsibilities, or \nwhat is at risk for them as police officers or for their agency if they fail to \nrespect the law while performing their duties. \n \nThe first 15-20 minutes of a training program must focus on the most critical \nconcepts the participants will need to take away.  Much of this time during the \ntraining witnessed by the United States was spent discussing historical issues \nwhich did not contribute to a proper understanding of the issues surrounding \nbias-free policing. The instructors cited to Germany after WWI and the \nresponse to conditions and questioning of law enforcement and the rise of \n15 | P a g e  \n \n\nHitler.  The import of the example was lost on our observers; this is cause for \nserious concern. Similarly, the training discussed slavery and Lincoln.  The \nrelevance of this point to bias-free policing was not clear.  \n  \nIf the intent of this portion of the training is to provide the participants some  \nhistorical context from the perspective of members of the community, \nespecially those that tend to have a negative or skeptical view of law \nenforcement, a more effective and helpful approach would be to modify the \nlesson plan to explain that the role of law enforcement is as the \nenforcer/guardian of societal rules.  That is an important role, because it can \nbe argued that our adherence to societal rules is the foundation of a civilized \nsociety. This role is also unique in American culture.  The training could \nprovide examples of how law enforcement, in the name of enforcing “societal \nrules” or the law, has been used as the tool to violate the rights of people in \nthis country, from the era post-Emancipation through the Civil Rights \nMovement. The lesson plan can also drive home the importance of this topic \nby explaining that law enforcement is the only profession in this country that \nis authorized (mandated) to make decisions and take actions that can take \naway what we as Americans value the most—our freedom, even our lives in \nsome circumstances.  Therefore, people in this country must have confidence \nthat their law enforcement professionals make bias-free decisions. \n \nA great deal of the training on bias-free policing focuses incorrectly on \nofficers’ feelings about being accused of bias, rather than why members of the \npublic view police as biased. For example, during a discussion regarding \nvideotaping of police activities, the focus was on the officers’ dislike of being \nvideotaped. The training also discussed an officer in Alabama who was \nattacked but hesitated because of his fear of being in the media.  This \napproach perpetuates the negative beliefs of the participants regarding this \ntopic and does nothing to address their role and responsibilities relative to \nbias-free policing. \n \nFurther to the point, the instructor made several statements throughout the \ntraining that undermined the intent of the training:  \n   “I know that this frustrates you, but this is what we have to do” \n   “Stop and frisk is absolutely an effective method when used \nproperly….” \n   “Act appropriately and you won't be accused of bias”  \n   “Our job is to stand around and look for crime, to be nosey” \n   Using the term “racially-biased policing,” but then stating “I don't like \nthis phrase either.”  \n   “A simple explanation [to an individual] removes the potential for \nbias” \nThese statements suggest that bias in policing is not a significant issue and \nreports of police bias are a matter only of community members’ perceptions \nthat officers can do little to prevent.  \n16 | P a g e  \n \n\n  \nThe training raises the crucial issue of implicit bias only at the end of the \ntraining. While it touches on issues such as Implicit Social Cognition and  \nmentioned the Harvard Implicit Bias test and Dr. Kenneth Clark’s “doll test,” \nthe discussion tended to be superficial and conclusory at best.  Participants \nbecame easily defensive during this discussion, which can be understandable.  \nHowever, the instructors needed to emphasize that implicit bias is real, albeit \nnot intentional, and show how it affects policing. \n  \nIndeed, the training concluded with a brief discussion of “Recognizing \nPerspectives.” Rather than training officers to recognize that their conduct, \nwhile intended one way, could legitimately be perceived by the community as \nsomething altogether different, the instructor emphasized a mentality of “us \nagainst them.”  This does not just undermine the message that police need to \nbe sensitive to other perspectives, but only hardens an attitude that others’ \nperceptions are incorrect and anti-police.  This last point was driven home, \nprobably unintentionally, by the instructor’s final message: that, if you do \nyour job and do it in accordance to the law, you can avoid claims of bias and \nyou are adhering to Procedural Justice. This is an incorrect statement of what \nProcedural Justice is, and, as noted above, serves to undermine the purpose of \nthe training. \n \nRecommendations \nAs discussed above, pedagogically, the training needs to become more \ninteractive and ensure focused and free discussion on the key issues around \nbias-free policing. Substantively, the training should be completely \nrevamped.  It is questionable whether trainers unfamiliar with the subject \nmatter, creating a course from scratch, can train on this subject in a fulsome \nand comprehensive fashion.  Serious consideration should be given to \nretaining instructors from outside the SCPD to train officers in this critical  \narea.  \n \nContinued training with the existing course material, in the current fashion,  \nwill not lead to compliance with this provision.  \n \nii. SCPD will conduct cultural sensitivity training for all SCPD officers at  \nleast annually. \nStatus  Noncompliance \nSCPD has developed a curriculum to instruct officers on cultural sensitivity, and \nAnalysis \nbegan classroom instruction in September 2015.  This training reflects effort and \ncommitment.  However, like the training in Bias-Free Policing, this training \nrequires substantial revision. In particular, the curriculum needs to discuss in a \nnonjudgmental way how people formulate stereotypes and why we come to rely \nupon them; why they are nevertheless harmful to effective policing; help \n17 | P a g e  \n \n\nparticipants identify and interrogate their own prejudgments about Suffolk \nCounty’s diverse cultures; and apply this in the context of policing and public \nsafety. Many of the pedagogical concerns identified in the Bias-Free Policing \nsection immediately above also apply here.  \n \nThe program starts by focusing on morals and values.  This is positive, as is the \nfact that the instructor also introduces the training module by sharing the new \nSCPD mission statement, and connecting it to constitutional requirements.  The \ninstructor also demonstrated the importance of cultural understanding by \nhighlighting the need to know the nuances of the different cultures.  However, \nshe did so by referencing and comparing the cultures of Latino gangs.  This was \ninappropriate, without additional context, and could foster inaccurate negative \nstereotypes about the local Latino community. \n \nMoreover, the instructor also commenced the module by apologizing to the \nofficers for having to teach these subjects. This serves only to reinforce any \nnegative feelings students may have about having to sit through the class, and \nundermines the message being transmitted.   \n \nFurther, as with the Bias-Free Policing training, there is too much lecture \nthroughout the class. For example, the instructor made good use of the concept \nof social distance to create motivation for the participants to engage the \ncommunity. Rather than lecture about this, the lesson plan should be modified \nto include table group or large group discussion to identify ways that they can \nclose social distance, and then create a list of the benefits of closing social \ndistance and enhancing the relationship with the people they have sworn to serve \nand protect. \n \nWhen discussing core values of large groups, the instructors must be careful to \navoid stereotyping. The use of “all” in reference to a particular group serves to \nreinforce stereotypes rather than break them down.    \n \nTying into the issues described above regarding Bias-Free Policing, this training \nalso does not adequately train students on how their misunderstanding of \ncultures can impact their policing activities.  The stated “Motivation” of the \nlesson indicates that the goal is to remove stereotypes; this is impossible.  The \nappropriate approach to stereotyping is to delve into why people create and use \nstereotypes and how reliance on stereotypes can negatively impact policing.  \nDiscussion should focus on common stereotypes of ethnic and racial groups that \nreside in Suffolk County, and how stereotyping may lead to improper treatment \nby law enforcement.    \n \nThe use of the BRIDGES formulation, while well-intentioned, does not function \nas effectively as SCPD would like it to.  It is too vague and is not sufficiently \npolicing-oriented.  The course objectives should clearly state what change will \nresult from this training. The training should focus on the cultural and ethnic \ncomposition of Suffolk County’s diverse population and highlight these groups’ \n18 | P a g e  \n \n\npublic safety vulnerabilities and/or barriers to effective police-community \nrelations and communication. This is more relevant to police personnel. \n \nIn sum, while the curriculum superficially addresses the requirements of the \nAgreement, it does so without ensuring that the participants fully understand that \nthe Department’s new policies change the expectations that the organization has \nregarding their performance as patrol staff.  It is unlikely, given the manner that \nthe information is communicated, that officers’ judgment and decision-making \nwill change after they leave the training environment and return to the street.   \n \nContinued training with the existing course material, in the current fashion, will \nnot lead to compliance with this provision.  \n \nRecommendations \nWe recommend that the training be revamped, consistent with our \nrecommendations regarding Bias-Free Policing, and that SCPD consider \nbringing in outside consultants to provide the necessary training. \n \nFinally, we have three specific recommendations regarding the Power Point \npresentation used during this training: \n \t  First, the slide on Children of Immigration should instead focus on (a) \nhow such children are often over-relied upon for interpretation and/or \novercoming cultural barriers and (b) that this can be detrimental to the \nchild and/or yield inaccurate information for police officers.    \n \t  Second, the slide on Non-U.S. Citizens and Immigration Status should \nmore directly reference the agency policy R&P 16.4 and explain the \n“criminal arrest and charge” exception thoroughly.  The manner of the \npresentation failed to capture the spirit behind the policy. Also, the \nexception was misstated: R&P 16.4 states that the person must have been \narrested and charged with a crime.  Similar to the Non-U.S. Citizens \nslide, the slide about the U-Visa misses the spirit behind the policy.  \nBoth of these policies were developed to break down trust barriers with \nundocumented immigrants, who can have a greater vulnerability of \nvictimization and are fearful of police.  The slides (and training), as \ncurrently formulated, do not accomplish this.  \n \t   Finally, the Waking in Oak Creek video is good, but it is not sufficiently \nrelated to the purpose of this training.  Indeed, the point of the video \nappeared to get lost—students somewhat understandably reacted most \nstrongly to a segment relating to an officer who was severely injured \nwhile trying to subdue the shooter at the Sikh temple that was under \nattack. Another “Not in Our Town” documentary—Light in the \nDarkness, about the killing of Marcelo Lucero and the aftermath in \nPatchogue—would be much more effective.  Excerpts from this could be \nshown, and would be far more relevant to the students in the room. \n \n   \n19 | P a g e  \n \n\nIV.  HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \na.  Training  \ni. SCPD will ensure that all officers  receive hate crime and hate incident \ntraining at least annually. The training curriculum will address: \n1. \tThe elements of relevant crimes, including hate crimes and bias crimes; \nand \n2. \tHow to properly charge offenses and avoid the downgrading of crimes, \nincluding hate crimes and hate incidents.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD has developed a curriculum to instruct officers on hate crimes and hate \nAnalysis \nincidents, and began classroom instruction in September 2015.  The curriculum  \nhas a number of strengths, and addresses both topics above.  The presentation \nwill need to be more tightly structured and organized in order to achieve \nsubstantial compliance.  Pedagogically, as with the other trainings, the hate \ncrimes training needs to be more interactive and participatory.  SCPD will need \nto train all officers on a revised training. \n  \nWe provide below comments on aspects of two training sessions the United \nStates observed. \n   The Hate Crimes Detective leading the training began by providing the \ncontact information of the Hate Crimes Unit (HCU).  The written \ninstructor’s notes do not contain this information; it is critical that they \ndo, so that non-HCU instructors will have it at hand.  The information \nmay be best presented at the end of the training; trainers should make \nevery effort to present examples or role plays touching on core concepts \nat the outset of the training, when the trainees’ attention is focused most \nsharply. \n   The training next discussed an example of an incident that was \ninvestigated as a hate crime.  Engaging the audience through an \ninteractive device at the outset is good.  The incident discussed required \nan explanation of fine distinctions4 that needs to be reserved for later in \nthe training, though. At this stage, the training needs to provide \nstraightforward illustrations of core concepts and drive home the \nseriousness of the problem of hate crimes.   \n   The training next discussed the hate crimes statute.  The training placed \nspecial emphasis on key phrases in the statute.  These are critical \nelements.  As we have shared in the past, the training may benefit by \nquickly transitioning from lecture (citing the critical decision points in an \nofficer’s assessment) to illustrative exercises (requiring the trainees to \n                                                            \n4 For example, the investigation  was complicated by the involved  parties’ false testimony.  This presents problems in  \ncriminal investigations that apply more generally than the specific hate crimes material that the training is designed \nto address. \n20 | P a g e  \n \n\nmake these same decisions as applied to simple examples). \n \t  The training lists demographic categories that may form the motivation \nfor a hate crime (the training refers to them as “protected classes”).  The \ntraining needs to explain that a hate crime may occur even when the \nperpetrator is not targeting a minority demographic, e.g., the perpetrator \nmay target someone because they are a non-Hispanic white individual.  \nThis should also be featured in an interactive exercise, and on the post-\ntest.  \n \t  The training included discussion of a high-profile hate crime that took \nplace in Suffolk County. Any discussion of this incident must emphasize \none critical lesson (among many) that the training participants may take \naway: patrol must stay vigilant in assessing incidents of criminal conduct \nfor potential hate crimes and hate incidents.  Discussing this incident \nwithout emphasizing this point is problematic. \n \t  The training used several real cases as examples.  We encourage the \ntrainers to continue to emphasize scenario-based training.  It is also good \nto use different media – descriptions of the events by the instructor, \nvideo, etc. – to engage the audience.  Several of the cases chosen \ninvolved collateral issues that detracted from the illustration of key \npoints, though.  SCPD would be better served modifying the facts of the \nscenario slightly to fit the point the instructor wants to illustrate, and \nexplaining that the instructor has taken these creative licenses. \n\t   Some examples at the end of the training (about two hours after the \ntraining started, in one session we observed) illustrated targeted \nconcepts. These were very helpful. \n\t   The Hate Crimes Detective leading the training emphasized the need to \ninfluence public perception as the reason for the training. Trainees \nwould benefit more from hearing that the training is building credibility \nwith the public – credibility that will require that officers are actually \nlearning and applying the critical skills they are developing in the \ntraining. Another reason for the training might be that it supports \nSCPD’s mission.  \n\t   The instructors did not reference the handout, and few participants \nfollowed the instruction using the handout. If the handout is meant as a \nreference for the officers to use in their work outside the training, \nparticipants should be so advised, and the handout can be distributed at \nthe conclusion of the training (so as not to divert participants’ attention \nfrom the visual aids).  \n\t   In each of the first two numbered bullet points on page 3 (entitled the \n“Handout”),5 SCPD should replace “and” with “or” in the list of \nprotected categories. \n\t   The time allotted for the training seems appropriate (although existing \ncontent will need to be tightened and additional elements incorporated, \n                                                            \n5 All references to pages are to  the training curriculum sent  on September 9, 2015.  \n21 | P a g e  \n \n\nas set forth herein).  \n \nSeveral necessary elements are missing from the current training: \n   The training does not discuss SCPD policy. \n   The written training curriculum does not currently address the duties that \nofficers have in responding to the scene of a potential hate crime.  It \nshould. Some of these steps may refer to general crime scene processing \nprocedures, such as securing the scene; requesting medical aid if needed; \ncollecting physical evidence; conducting a preliminary investigation; \ndocumenting information from victims and witnesses on suspected \nperpetrators; and recording statements made by suspects.  To the extent \nthese constitute review of common practices, the instructors may be able \nto note these duties without devoting substantial time to discussing them.  \nHowever, responding to the scene of a potential hate crime may give rise \nto specific duties: identifying and collecting certain types of physical \nevidence, such as hate literature, spray paint cans, and symbolic objects \nused by hate groups, such as swastikas and crosses; the importance of \nprecision in recording the statements (to capture, for example, \nexpressions of bias); identifying prior bias-motivated occurrences in the \nimmediate area or against the same victim; requesting the presence of a \nsupervisor and/or the Hate Crimes Unit, and briefing these personnel on \nthe investigation; and assisting investigators in complying with any \nfederal or state hate crime data collection reporting requirements.  If \nthese duties are not currently part of SCPD policy regarding hate crimes, \nSCPD should probably consider incorporating them. \n \t  Hate crimes may also more frequently give rise to the need for \ninterpreters; officers should be advised that part of their duties in \nresponding effectively to hate crimes is understanding SCPD’s Language \nAccess Plan (discussed below) and using interpretation services \neffectively when necessary. (Although any more detailed discussion of \nlanguage access should be reserved for the relevant training.) \n \nAlthough not required, the training may also benefit from small group \ndiscussions in which participants are invited to think about their respective \nindividual experiences with enforcement situation(s) that had the elements of a \nhate crime.  The groups may discuss common experiences and identify \nsolutions.  \n \nFinally, while a Hate Crimes Unit detective delivered the trainings that the \nUnited States observed, SCPD has shared that it expects to call upon SCPD \nAcademy instructors with no specialized expertise in hate crimes to deliver the \ntraining eventually.  SCPD will need to implement measures to ensure that \nAcademy instructors have the resources they need to address the material and \nquestions that arise during the training, and to ensure that instructors deliver a \nhigh-quality presentation. \n \n22 | P a g e  \n \n\nb.   Tracking and Reporting  \ni.SCPD will implement a policy to track, analyze and report patterns and \ntrends regarding hate crimes and hate incidents. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nIn January 2015, SCPD produced a revised draft of its policy defining the \nAnalysis \nparameters of hate crimes audits, R&P 24.6.  SCPD Self-Report, Jan. 2015, \nAtt. 14. Our review of the policy showed that it contained many of the \nnecessary elements.  \n \nIn August 2015, SCPD produced a further proposed revision to R&P 24.6.  \nSCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, Att. 10.  SCPD revised the policy to specify \nthat it will analyze the information on hate crimes for “possible trends and \npatterns regarding the type of hate act, frequency of occurrence, geographic \narea of occurrence and type of victim.” See id. ¶ VI(I)(3). This general \ndescription of the trend analysis is a helpful addition.  More detail can be \nprovided, as described in the Recommendations, below. \n \nIn addition to providing real-time access to mapping of hate crimes to the \ncommand staff at SCPD headquarters and the command staff of each precinct, \nsee SCPD Self-Report, Jan. 2015, Att. 14 ¶ VI(I)(2), the proposed updated \npolicy also provides for the annual dissemination and publication of a report \nanalyzing the trends mentioned above, see id. ¶ VI(I)(4).  \n \nIn practice, SCPD’s mapping system appears to be programmed properly and \noffers reasonably good functionality. We did not see any obvious problems.  \n  \nA further discussion of implementation of the policy appears in our Analysis \nre Paragraph IV(b)(ii), infra. \n \nRecommendations \nThe policy should provide more detail regarding the trend analyses conducted.  \nInsofar as this information is sensitive, the policy can alternatively provide \nthat SCPD will memorialize a list of  more specific analyses to conduct, and \nmaintain such list confidentially.  \n \nIt may add value to the database and hate crimes/incidents map by mapping \nthe hate crimes/incidents overlaid onto data regarding other ambient incidents \nsuch as traffic incidents, so that the rate at which hate incidents occur may be \ninterpreted in relation to other incidents.  This may require substantial \nexpertise with GIS software. SCPD may want to consult its Research and \nDevelopment Division or other County resources to see if this is feasible. \n \nii. Within one year of the Effective Date and annually thereafter, SCPD will \nproduce a report mapping and analyzing for potential patterns and trends all \nhate crimes and hate incidents which have occurred over the previous six \n23 | P a g e  \n \n\nmonths. The report will detail SCPD’s planned response to any identified \npattern or trend. Throughout the pendency of this Agreement, the report \nwill be provided to the United States at least five business days before the \nreport is made public. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nIn January 2015, SCPD presented a review of the hate crimes and hate \nAnalysis \nincidents in Suffolk County in 2014.  See SCPD Self-Report, Jan. 2015, \nApp’x A. The report provided detail about each incident, the steps the \ninvestigators took, and the efforts to identify perpetrators of the incident in \nquestion and/or links to other incidents. \n \nIn March 2015, the United States requested: (1) the process of collecting data \nand inputting it into the database; (2) steps taken to maintain quality control; \nand (3) the analysis that SCPD conducts once the data is gathered.  As to the \nthird category, we asked that SCPD provide a detailed description of the \ncriteria that it considers in identifying patterns or trends, including, if \napplicable: \n   Geographic patterns; \n   Demographic characteristics of victims;  \n   Demographic characteristics of offenders (when known); \n   The type and timing of events; and \n   Alternative explanations for desultory patterns.  \nSCPD has agreed to provide this information in its next annual report.  See  \nSCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, at 13.  The trends reviewed should be set forth \nin SCPD policy, as mentioned above.  See Analysis re Paragraph IV(b)(i), \nsupra. \n \nIn August 2015, we requested that SCPD identify trends in hate crimes \nidentified since January 2014. SCPD did not list new trends identified beyond \nwhat was listed in its January 2015 report. \n \nOn-site observations in September 2015 provided some detail about SCPD’s \nanalyses of hate crimes and hate incidents.  SCPD’s mapping system permits \nthe user to view hate crimes and hate incidents on a map of the police district.  \nThe marker representing each crime/incident reveals additional data.  \n \nThe low volume of incidents may present difficulties in analyzing for some  \ntrends.  At a minimum, however, SCPD should be analyzing data over time, \nas described in the recommendation below. \n \nRecommendations \nIt may be helpful to map hate crimes alongside other incidents of crime to \ninterpret the occurrence of hate incidents in relation to other types of \nincidents, as mentioned above.  See Analysis re Paragraph IV(b)(i), supra. \nSCPD should also look for trends over time, focusing especially on the type \n24 | P a g e  \n \n\nand timing of events, and victim and offender demographic characteristics.   \n \nSCPD should present the criteria it will use for all trend analyses.  \n \n c. Quality assurance \ni.  SCPD will implement a policy describing its HCU quality assurance \nprocess that ensures that HCU investigations follow proper techniques and \nprocedures.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nIn January 2015, SCPD produced a revised draft of its policy defining the \nparameters of hate crimes audits, R&P 24.6.  SCPD Self-Report, Jan. 2015, \nAtt. 14. The United States posed questions about the proposed revisions.  In \nAugust 2015, SCPD produced a further proposed revision to R&P Chapter 24, \nSection 6. SCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, Att. 10.  The new draft includes, as \napplicable here, an additional clause specifying that the criteria for a complete \ninvestigation are the Hate Crimes Investigators’ Responsibilities in the \npolicy’s subdivision VI(D).  See id. ¶ VI(F)(2).  These include, for example, \nensuring that the scene is protected, preserved and processed; interviewing all \nvictims and witnesses; canvassing the neighborhood for additional sources of \nevidence; determining if a pattern of such incidents exists; removing offensive \nphysical evidence, once it has been properly documented; maintaining contact \nwith the victim; and other steps.  See id. ¶ VI(D). These are sound criteria for \nassessing the quality of hate crimes investigations. \n \nImplementation of the Policy \nDuring our on-site assessment in September 2015, the HCU demonstrated a \nsoftware program used to sample cases for the audit.  SCPD reports that it \nselects the cases in its report randomly using this software (and does not \nsingle out particular cases for review). \n \nThe hate crimes auditing process is increasingly detailed, although the report, \nas discussed below, should adhere more closely to the criteria in R&P 24.6.  \nThis is explained further below. \n \nOur review of a selection of the hate crimes investigations themselves showed \nthem to be, in general, comprehensive and thorough.  The detectives at the \nHate Crimes Unit appear committed to the enforcement of hate crime laws \nand knowledgeable about their area of focus. As discussed below, however, \nsometimes casefiles left more questions than answers.  Our review of \ninvestigations remains ongoing.  \n \nRecommendations \nSCPD should expand on the reports delivered to date, as described \n25 | P a g e  \n \n\nimmediately below. \n \nSCPD only recently implemented its form for recording the status of \ncommunication with the victims of hate crimes/incidents, but it will need to \nmonitor this process going forward. \n \nii.  Six months after the Effective Date, and every six months thereafter \nthroughout the pendency of this agreement, SCPD will forward to the United \nStates a report describing all random audits of HCU investigations \ncompleted within the current six-month time period and any corrective \nactions planned or taken as a result of the audits. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD has timely submitted reports corresponding to this Paragraph of the \nAnalysis \nAgreement.  In the reports, the Commanding Officer of the SCPD Hate \nCrimes Unit affirmed his review of a selection of hate crimes investigations, \nand summarized the cases reviewed.  The reports provided some helpful \ninformation, but until the August 2015 report, SCPD did not provide the \ncriteria used by the Commanding Officer to evaluate each case for accuracy \nand completeness.  SCPD provides that information in the form of draft policy \nlanguage. See Analysis re Paragraph IV(c)(i), supra. \n \nAs mentioned above, the criteria for quality assessment that SCPD provided \nin August 2015 are sound. These criteria should form the structure for \nevaluation of each investigation.  The report should also apply the elements of \nthe hate crime statute to the facts known about the incident at the time of the \nreport, and make an independent assessment of whether the known facts meet \nthe elements of a hate crime; the report should subsequently compare the \ninvestigator’s determination to that of  Det. Lt. Hernandez.  Finally, the report \nshould make assessments concerning case progress; in some cases, several \nmonths had transpired since the last interview or other event in the \ninvestigation, and the report summarily concurred that the case should be \nclassified as “pending,” without further discussion. \n \nCompliance with this provision is linked to compliance with Paragraph \nIV(c)(i).  \n \n   \n26 | P a g e  \n \n\nV. LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE  \n a. SCPD policy will require the following: \ni. A current Language Access Plan that explains how SCPD will implement \nits policies and procedures to provide meaningful access to police services.  \nThis plan will be updated at least annually. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nSCPD has accepted the recommendation of the United States’ experts and \nintends to finalize a single Language Access Policy (LAP) to replace its \nLanguage Access Plan (R&P 26.6) and R&P 26.5, Persons with Limited \nEnglish Proficiency.  The combined policy appears to comply with the \nrequirements of this section.  However, SCPD should develop a more \nextensive plan, which will serve as an “administrative road map” for \nimplementation.  To ensure proper implementation, SCPD will also need to \ntrain officers fully on how to engage with individuals who are LEP, the \nresources available to them and how to employ those resources.  For example, \nthe LAP discusses use of bilingual officers who are not Department \nAuthorized Interpreters (“DAIs”) in certain situations, except in taking \nstatements with criminal suspects, victims, and witnesses and obtaining \ncomplaints about SCPD personnel.  The distinction should be clearly \ncommunicated during training (i.e., qualified bilingual personnel will only be \nusing their language skills when the interaction originates with them, or in the \ncase of Spanish-speaking bilingual 9-1-1 operators, when calls are also routed \nto them). \n   \nFurther, the proposed LAP states that the IAB will “periodically” request a list \nof 9-1-1 calls to monitor services.  This should be more routine and scheduled, \nsimilar to other monitoring efforts.  Broadly speaking, all monitoring \nactivities (whether they be ordered by the Chief of Patrol, the Language \nAccess Coordinator, or IAB) should be well documented and coordinated.   \nWe recommend that the policy provide that the Language Access Coordinator \nmaintain a list of bilingual personnel, in addition to DAIs. \n \nFinally, the LAP also contains references to using American Sign Language \ninterpretation with individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing.  While there \nare similarities with engaging individuals who are LEP, the SCPD should \ndevelop a separate policy for addressing the needs of individuals who are deaf \nor hard of hearing. \n \nIn addition to these general comments, SCPD should also take note of the \nfollowing specific recommended revisions: \n   Provision II.C (page 2) should refer to Policy 16.4. \n   SCPD needs to clarify what the purpose is of “collecting LEP  \ncontacts”, as noted under VI.A.2.b. \n27 | P a g e  \n \n\n \t  SCPD should add “inappropriate” after “excessive” in VI.A.2.d(4). \n \t  Provision VI.A.3.c (page 5) should distinguish between community-\nbased organizations and local school districts and hospitals—they are \nnot the same. \n \t   To enable proper quality assurance, as noted under VI.A.2.d, the \nPDCS 7042 Language Assistance Tracking forms should collect \ndocumentation of the use of any and all forms of language assistance, \nincluding temporary interpreters.  \nWe make further recommendations regarding the revised Plan/Policy in our \nAnalyses regarding other Paragraphs of the Language Access Section. \n \nImplementation \nThe current R&Ps 26.5 and 26.6 as well as the proposed Plan/Policy require \nthe practices below.  We note the following regarding implementation of these \npractices:   \n \n\t   Language access and immigration status: The policies prohibit \nofficers from relying on an individual’s use of SCPD language \nservices as a basis for inquiring into immigration status.  SCPD should \ndevelop a mechanism for ensuring that officers do not make such \nunauthorized inquiries and for determining that the policy is observed.   \n \n \t  SCPD reports that officers have notified consular officers only twice \nin 2015, signaling that no more than two non-citizens have been \narrested.  Even if this is accurate, SCPD needs to develop more \nrigorous data collection in this area and improve its training.  \n \n\t   Signage Declaring the Availability of Interpreters: Policies require \nsignage at entrances to SCPD facilities notifying LEP individuals of  \nthe availability of an interpreter free of charge.  SCPD maintains such \nsignage at the facilities we have observed. \n  \n\t   Availability of Vital Documents:  See Analysis re Paragraph V(a)(v), \ninfra. \n  \n\t   Language Identification Charts must be posted at all public police \nfacilities and maintained in all sector cars.  The United States found \nLanguage Identification Charts in the facilities and sector cars we \nobserved. \n \n\t   Translation of all non-English Correspondence: SCPD reported in \nMarch 2015 that its only correspondence in a language other than \nEnglish were completed community surveys.  SCPD reports that, in \nthe reporting period ending August 1, 2015, no correspondence was \nsubmitted in non-English languages.  \n \n28 | P a g e  \n \n\n   Use of Language Line: Overall, the use of Language Line telephonic \ninterpretation services has increased. However, our observations \nindicate that there are substantial deficiencies in this program.  \nOfficers still appear reluctant to use the service, and still appear to be \nusing bystanders and family members to interpret (see below).  During \none ride along, an officer noted that the Language Line cell phone \ncharger was “wobbly,” and therefore not able to effectively charge the \nphone. In another case, an officer indicated that his regular vehicle \nwas out of service, so he had no Language Line cell phone.  SCPD \nneeds to do more to ensure that officers understand how and when to \nuse Language Line and the importance of proper interpretation.  \n \n   Use of interpreters, Use of temporary interpreters: During our site \nvisit, we observed that there is still significant reluctance to move \naway from using bystanders and children for language assistance, \nbecause of a perception that this has never been a problem.   \n \nIn addition to the comments provided above, it is evident that the training \nmust be updated to accurately and comprehensively reflect each component of \nthe finalized policy. \n \nEnsuring that Suffolk County’s diverse LEP populations have meaningful \naccess to police services will require a substantial cultural change at SCPD.  \nPersonnel will have to dispatch with methods that may seem intuitively \nprudent (relying upon bystanders to interpret), while adopting new methods \nwith rigor (ensuring that appropriate sector cars have functioning Language \nLine access, and routinely using it).  We commend SCPD for its steps down \nthis path, but there is considerable work left to do.  \n \nii.  Translations of the Language Access Plan and Policy into Spanish and \nother non-English languages as appropriate and posting in a public area of \nthe police department building, on its website, and in any other locations \nthroughout the County where individuals go to seek police assistance.   \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nThe current policy does not incorporate all of the elements of this section. The \nproposed consolidated Plan/Policy should require that it be translated and that \na Spanish version be distributed. \n \nHowever, in practice, SCPD has consistently distributed the Spanish version \nof the Language Access Plan at department facilities and has maintained a \ncopy on its website. Translations of the LAP into the five priority languages \nhave not yet been undertaken. \n \n29 | P a g e  \n \n\nRecommendations \nSCPD should list the Language Access Plan and Policy as a “vital document,” \nrequiring that a Spanish translation be maintained at all times.  In addition, \nSCPD should amend the Plan/Policy to require that Spanish versions of the \nPlan/Policy be distributed in all public areas and on the website.  Additionally, \nSCPD should ensure that all translations of the LAP are conducted by \nLanguage Line Services (or another qualified entity) to maximize accuracy, \nand are widely available to all intended users or recipients of the documents.  \nWhen the translations are completed, they should be reviewed by community \nstakeholders to ensure that the translations are appropriate for local linguistic \ncommunities. \n \niii. Distribution of the Language Access Plan and Policy to all SCPD staff and \nto  community  organizations  serving  LEP  communities  encountered  by \nSCPD.  \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nCurrent policy provides for this distribution.  The proposed Plan/Policy \nrequires distribution to community groups. \n \nSCPD has distributed its language access policies to many community \norganizations.  We encourage SCPD to continue to identify additional \ndistribution points. \n \nRecommendation  \nThe proposed Plan/Policy should be amended to require distribution to all \nSCPD members.  \n \niv.  Availability  of  Citizen  Complaint/  Compliment  forms  in  Spanish  and \nother common non-English languages in all precincts and on SCPD’s website  \nfor both completion and submission. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nSCPD policy contains the relevant language, has translated this form into \nSpanish, and has made hard copies available in its precincts.  Copies of the \nform appear in several other common languages on the SCPD website. \n \nSCPD is undertaking the steps to fulfill compliance with this Paragraph, \nincluding online submission of complaints/compliments and posting of the \nform in other non-English languages, as appropriate.   \n \n30 | P a g e  \n \n\nRecommendation  \nSCPD should amend the proposed Plan/Policy so that it requires that the \nwebsite link to versions of the Complaint/Compliment form in common non-\nEnglish languages. \n \nv. Translation of all vital written documents and materials shall be consistent \nwith  DOJ  Guidance,  in  order  to  ensure  that  LEP  individuals  in  the  \ncommunity have meaningful access to such documents and materials.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nSCPD’s policies continue to appropriately require (a) translation of the \nfollowing documents into the six most commonly spoken non-English \nlanguages in the Suffolk County police district, and (b) that they be available \nin public police facilities and on SCPD’s website: \na.   How to Obtain a Police Report, (PDCS-8100) \nb.   Family Offense Assistance and Court Procedures, (PDCS-7l09) \nc.   What to do When Stopped by the Police, (PDCS-7148 ) \nd.   Missing Person Guidelines \ne.   Special Needs/Silver Alert Program, (PDCS-8060) \nf.   Crime Victim Information Report, (PDCS-8105) \ng.   Compliment/Complaint Information Report, (POCS-1300-1) \nh.   Mental Health Assistance Notification, (PDCS-7146) \nUnder the proposed Plan/Policy, these documents are required to be translated \nonly into Spanish and “other relevant languages as determined by the \nLanguage Access Coordinator.”  See Plan/Policy subdivision VI(B)(2)(b)-(c).  \nThe policy should be revised to ensure compliance with this section and to \nensure that local LEP populations can have meaningful access.  Many of the \nabove documents can be found in hard copy at SCPD precincts and other \nfacilities.  \n \nRecommendations \nAlthough SCPD has described its translation of vital documents as an \n“ongoing process,” SCPD is nearing the point where it may want to undertake \nan audit of all facilities to ensure that hard copies of the necessary vital \ndocuments are posted.  SCPD should begin to consider relevant languages \nother than English or Spanish spoken in the communities covered by each \nprecinct. Such a review should also take into account the location of the \nposted documents within the reception areas of SCPD facilities, to ensure  \nmeaningful access.   \n \nSCPD shared during our September visit to SCPD facilities that it has recently \nfinalized the content for the “What do to When Stopped By Police” brochure \nand has identified additional “vital” documents to translate (i.e., CVIR, \ngeneral receipt for property, medical release form, and domestic violence \n31 | P a g e  \n \n\nassessment form). Copies of these should be provided to DOJ and listed on \nthe SCPD website. \n \nvi.  Translation  of  any  citizen  correspondence  received  that  is  in  a  non-\nEnglish  language.  If  that  correspondence  when  translated  would  be \nconsidered a citizen complaint, then the information as translated will be \nprocessed in the same manner as are citizen complaints originally received in  \nEnglish. \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nThe Language Access Plan has incorporated this Paragraph into policy.  The \npolicy provides that authorized interpreters shall translate the correspondence; \nthis should be changed to “authorized translators.”  SCPD also reports it has \nnot received any citizen correspondence in a non-English language since the \neffective date. \n \nRecommendations \nSCPD has conducted substantial outreach to the LEP community concerning \nother initiatives, such as the universal entrance exam for cadets.  We suggest \nthat SCPD review what lessons, if any, can be drawn from the successes of its \nother outreach efforts to ensure that members of Suffolk County’s LEP \npopulation recognize that SCPD has processes in place to accept and \nappropriately route correspondence in languages other than English, including \ncitizen compliment/complaint forms.  \n \nvii.  Availability  of  bilingual  operators  for  complaint  phone  lines  or  a \ndedicated  Spanish  complaint  phone  number.    SCPD  will  indicate  on  its \nSpanish-language  Compliment/Complaint  form  that  the  phone  operator \nspeaks Spanish. \nStatus  Compliance Rating Pending—Insufficient Documentation  \nVery few calls have been received to date and thus, it is premature to assess \nAnalysis \ncompliance at this point in time.  \n \nAdditional outreach needs to be undertaken with Latino and LEP community \nadvocates to ensure that they know about the compliment/complaint line and \nare informing their constituents to use it communicate feedback.  See  \nRecommendations re paragraph V(a)(vi), supra. \n \n32 | P a g e  \n \n\nviii. Objective oral language proficiency standards and annual proficiency  \ntesting for all IAB members who are designated as “Spanish-speaking” or as \nspeaking a non-English language. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD’s plan for testing Department Authorized Interpreters and bilingual \nAnalysis \npersonnel, as relayed to the United States, now seems appropriate.  The SCPD \nwill be paying Language Line Services to test/qualify prospective DAIs for \ninterpreting skills. For those who do not pass interpreter certification, a \nsecond level of language proficiency testing will be conducted to determine if \nprospects are qualified to serve as department bilingual personnel.  As of \nSeptember 2015, SCPD was conducting a trial with Language Line with staff \nof varying Spanish-language proficiencies.  We understand that SCPD will \nimplement annual proficiency testing of Spanish-speaking Internal Affairs \npersonnel as part of this process. We understand that SCPD will initially  \ncertify just 50 staff as bilingual interpreters.  This will present a challenge, to \nensure that an appropriate number of staff members/ officers are scheduled to \nwork to ensure appropriate language access coverage.  \n \nThere is currently no plan for testing/qualifying personnel for translation \nskills; SCPD indicated that they would work on this after the interpreting and \nverbal language proficiency testing processes were finalized.    \n \nRecommendations \nAs discussed above, we recommend that the Language Access Coordinator \nmaintain a list of bilingual SCPD personnel, in addition to interpreters.  \n \nSCPD will need to document testing and certification of interpreters and \nbilingual personnel.  We look forward to reviewing the results. \n \nix.  Recording  and  periodic  auditing  of  phone  calls  through  the  multi-\nlanguage toll-free complaint hotline. \nStatus  Compliance Rating Pending—Insufficient Documentation    \nSCPD policy requires such recording. However, few phone calls have been \nAnalysis \nreceived, so we are unable to analyze the effectiveness of this policy.  \n \nx. Documentation of the use of any interpreter used when conducting a field \ninterview or interrogation of an LEP individual, including the following: \n1. the date; \n2. the location; \n33 | P a g e  \n \n\n 3. the full name of the interpreter; \n4.  the non-English language spoken by the interpreter; \n5. the relationship (if any) of the interpreter to the LEP individual; \n6.  contact information for  the  interpreter, including telephone numbers, \nemail and postal address; \n    7.  the  name  of  the  witness,  victim,  and  subject  person  requiring  an \ninterpreter to the extent not prohibited by privacy laws; and \n8. a summary of any action taken. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis  SCPD has implemented a policy that requires officers to document the use of \ninterpreters.  During the site visit, we learned that the SCPD has changed the \nname of the Interpreter Tracking form to a Language Assistance Tracking \nform.  Completion of the form has been integrated into the CAD system for all \nincidents that get assigned a central complaint number (with an L designation) \nand are assigned to officers on patrol.  Officers cannot close out the call until \nthey complete the form.  This is a very positive development and is working \nwell.  For those calls that do not get a central complaint number (i.e., traffic \nstops or individual inquiries made at the precinct), paper tracking forms are \nbeing used. The forms comply with the requirements of this section.  The \nfinal version of this form should enable documentation of each type of \nlanguage assistance service that was used, including temporary interpreters.  \nWe note, however, that the documents we reviewed indicate that use of the \nforms is uneven.  Further training and emphasis on accuracy and completion \nof the forms is necessary.   \nRecommendation  \nSCPD needs to emphasize the importance of preparing these documents fully \nand accurately and ensure that this occurs.  \n \nb. SCPD will revise “Language Line Translating and Interpreting Service,” Order \nNumber 09-117, as follows:  \ni.  The  order  will  use  the  term  “interpretation”  to  refer  to  oral \ncommunication, and “translation” to refer to written communication.  As \nwritten, the order uses both terms interchangeably. \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nSCPD has made the required revision. SCPD should apply this distinction \nAnalysis \nconsistently throughout its language access policies. \n34 | P a g e  \n \n\n \nc.   SCPD will modify its practices and implement the revised Chapter 26, Section 5,  \n“Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” as approved by the United States. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis  As discussed above, SCPD proposes a single policy, see SCPD Self-Report, \nAug. 2015, Att. 12, that will replace its Language Access Plan (Rules & \nProcedures Chapter 26, Section 6) from August 2014 and R&P 26.5, Persons \nwith Limited English Proficiency.  See our analysis contained Paragraph \nV(a)(i) above. \n \nd.   SCPD will ensure that the home page of its website states, in at least Spanish, how  \nto access language assistance services and Spanish translations of SCPD policies and \nother relevant information.   \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nSCPD has two separate buttons on its website homepage labeled, \nAnalysis \n“Información en Español.” See \nhttp://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/index.htm. Each button directs the \nuser to a page dedicated to Spanish-language forms, policies, and other \nliterature.  See http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/information_sp.htm.   \n \nIn the recently concluded reporting period, SCPD added a link under the table \nof forms in non-English languages that provides an additional route to access \nthe Spanish-language forms page.  See http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/ \npolice/onlineforms.htm.  \n \nSCPD reports that it has submitted its Chinese forms to be re-translated in  \nSimplified Chinese, rather than Traditional Chinese, as we recommended \npreviously. \nDespite improvements, SCPD’s website would substantially benefit from a \nmore functional platform. SCPD reports that it is seeking funding in order to \nmake the necessary improvements.  \n \nRecommendation  \nAs we recommended in June 2015, SCPD should add a footer that states the \ntarget language and the date of the last update/translation to all translated \ndocuments.   \n \ne.   SCPD  will  maintain  effective  incentives  for  bilingual  employees  to  become  \nSCPDDAIs, including assignments, promotions, and other means available to the \nCounty. \n35 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Noncompliance \nSCPD has not identified incentives corresponding to this provision.  As SCPD \nAnalysis \nnotes in its Self-Report dated August 1, 2015, it is in a better position to \nimplement such incentives now that the certification process for Department \nAuthorized Interpreters has been finalized and expects to do so and is \nconsidering the best method for offering such incentives. \n \nRecommendations \nAs we reported during the last reporting period, qualifying incentives under \nthis Paragraph must offer a real and tangible benefit to employees who certify \nas SCPDAIs. This should extend to bilingual officers as well.  We look \nforward to reviewing SCPD’s proposed incentive program when it ready. \n \nf.   Within  90  days  of  the  Effective  Date,  SCPD  will  implement  a  process  of \nconsultation with representatives of the Latino community to develop and annually \nreview: implementation of the Language Access Policy, including areas of possible  \ncollaboration to ensure its effectiveness; accuracy and quality of SCPD language \nassistance services; and concerns, ideas, and strategies for ensuring language access.   \nThis  process  will  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  United  States  prior  to  its \nimplementation.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nWe  understand  from  both  SCPD  and  Latino  community  advocates  that \nAnalysis \nmeetings have been held.    \n \ng. Within 180 days of the Effective Date, and annually thereafter, SCPD will provide \nat least four hours of training to all personnel on providing language assistance  \nservices to LEP individuals.  This training will include:  \ni. SCPD’s LEP plan, policies, and procedures and the requirements of Title \nVI and this Agreement; \nii.  How to identify the non-English language and language assistance needs \nof an LEP individual during an in-person or telephone interaction;  \n  iii. How to access SCPD-authorized, telephonic and in-person interpreters; \n  iv. How to work with interpreters in the field and assess interpreter quality; \nv.  How to account for cultural diversity and language barriers in policing; \nand \nvi.  Basic command terms and phrases in Spanish for officers assigned to \npatrol in areas with significant Spanish-speaking populations. \n36 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Noncompliance \nSCPD has begun to provide some training to officers regarding Language \nAnalysis \nAccess. Further, we recognize that the training we viewed was conducted \nwhile the new Language Access Policy was being finalized.   There was good \nuse of videos in this training. However, the training provided does not meet \nthe requirements of this section.  It lacks clarity and is sometimes inaccurate.   \n The training did not effectively communicate that a change is being \nimplemented in the agency’s service to LEP individuals and why this is \nchange is necessary.  SCPD must also fully integrate into the training the \nmandated use of DAIs, Language Line or, in some circumstances, bilingual \npersonnel. There was no training on basic Spanish phrases, as required by the \nLAP. Additionally, only one hour of true language access training is currently \nbeing provided. That hour is sandwiched between two other hours of training, \nwhich address Cultural Proficiency and Effective Communication.  These \npurport to relate to language access issues, but in fact do not sufficiently relate \nto this topic. Even if they did, this would amount to only three hours of \nLanguage Access training, and this Paragraph of the Agreement requires four \nhours. \n \nRecommendations \nAs with the other training sessions we witnessed, the training on Language \nAccess should include more scenario/role play, focusing on common \nencounters with limited English proficient individuals.  Demonstrating the use \nof the Language Line was good, but the same should be done with teaching \nthe four stated “How Tos” in the LAP. \n  \nEveryone should be given a copy of the Language Access policy, and it \nshould be interactively discussed, section by section, informing personnel \nabout what is required. Merely referencing sections of the LAP is insufficient. \n \nThe benefits of using Department-authorized language assistance services, \nincluding DAIs and Language Line, need to be better communicated.  \nAccessing these services will undoubtedly take time and effort, so officers \nneed to understand why it is in their best interests to do so.  Discussing some  \nproblem scenarios where either children or an unauthorized interpreter are \nused is important because these have been SCPD’s default sources of \nlanguage assistance for years, and they are no longer permitted, except during \nan exigency.   \n \nThe purpose, process, and benefits of using the new Language Assistance \nTracking form needs to be better communicated.  \n \nThe training must discuss in depth the exigency exception to use of authorized \ninterpreters.    \n \nIf the Effective Communication segment remains in training, the SCPD \n37 | P a g e  \n \n\ntrainers should learn more about procedural justice and incorporate this \nconcrete training content into their lesson. (See here for some police training \npodcasts on the topic: http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/default.asp?Item=2656). \n \nh.   One  year  after  the  Effective  Date  and  annually  thereafter  throughout  the \npendency  of  this  Agreement,  SCPD  will  conduct  a  satisfaction  survey  of \nrepresentatives from the Latino community regarding SCPD’s LEP efforts.  SCPD \nwill partner with local Latino advocacy groups in order to conduct the survey.  \nSCPD will produce a report analyzing the results of each survey and detailing what \nmeasures, if any, SCPD will take as a result of the analysis.  Each report will be \nprovided to the United States throughout the pendency of this Agreement at least \nfive business days before it is made public. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD is conducting the required survey and has collected a significant \nAnalysis \nnumber of responses.  We look forward to reviewing SCPD’s complete \nassessment of how these will inform their operations. \nHowever, as SCPD acknowledged, there is substantial room for improvement \nin the current survey form, both in substance and form.  \n  \nRecommendation  \nSCPD should continue to explore other survey tools, particularly those that \nhave been evaluated by researchers. For example, the national “Police-Citizen \nInteraction Survey,” developed by National Police Research Platform is one \nthat is being used by a growing number of municipalities.  More information \nis available here: http://nationalpoliceresearch.org/.  \n \n   \n38 | P a g e  \n \n\nVI. ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT  \n a. Reporting misconduct \ni. SCPD policy will require that all members have the duty to report \nallegations of discriminatory policing to a supervisor or to the IAB.  Failure \nto report or document allegations of misconduct will be grounds for \ndisciplinary action. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nThe proposed draft of R&P 1.11 requires “[m]embers who have observed or are \naware of other members who have engaged in bias-based policing [to] report such \nconduct to a supervisor immediately.”6  SCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, Att. 1.  \nR&P 1.11’s definition of bias-based policing is consonant with the Settlement \nAgreement’s definition.  Compare id. with Agreement ¶ II(i).  \n   \nThe August 2015 SCPD Self-Report also cites to R&P Chapter 5, Section 2(V)(E).  \nThis appears to reference the draft of this policy submitted with the January 2015 \nSCPD Self-Report.  That draft requires that suspected violations be referred to an \nofficer in charge.  The policy likewise requires that allegations of discriminatory \npolicing be referred to IAB within 48 hours. \n \nThe proposed R&P 1.11 also dictates that “[m]embers who have engaged in, \nignored or condoned biased-based policing shall be subject to discipline.”  See  \nSCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, Att. 1, §V(B).  \n \nThese draft policy changes collectively capture the spirit of Paragraph VI(a)(i).  \nThe relevant changes to the policies referenced above should be finalized and \nimplemented at SCPD’s earliest availability.  \n \nPolicy Recommendation \nMembers who “ignore[] or condone[] biased-based policing” should certainly be \nsubject to discipline. At the next annual review, SCPD must also add the precise \nlanguage of Agreement ¶ VI(a)(i), subjecting to discipline those members who \nknow of misconduct but fail to report or document it. 7  \n \nImplementation  \nSCPD has submitted satisfactory policies  for the United States’ review with the \nAugust 2015 SCPD Self-Report, but much of SCPD’s work in implementing this \nprovision is ahead of it. \n                                                            \n6 Thereafter, “[s]upervisors receiving notification that a member has engaged in a bias-based policing shall report \nsuch conduct to the Internal Affairs Bureau in  accordance with the procedures” in R&P Chapter 5. \n7 R&P Chapter 5, Section 2(V)(A)(14) appears to direct members to report and, where necessary, record \nmisconduct,  but does not specify that it is subject to  discipline.  \n39 | P a g e  \n \n\n \nSCPD has seen problematic situations to which this Paragraph would apply in \nrecent months.  See, e.g., Analysis re Paragraph VI(a)(ii), infra (February 2014 \ncomplainant ultimately reports allegations of racial profiling directly to IAB after \nhaving first made same allegations to precinct desk officer and patrol supervisor) \n(no evidence that precinct officers reported allegations to IAB themselves).  \n \nA document request related to this Paragraph was pending at the time of this \nCompliance Assessment. \n \nii. SCPD policy will ensure that all complaints are investigated even if the \ncomplainant does not submit the complaint on an actual SCPD complaint \nform.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nThe draft of R&P Chapter 5, Section 2 submitted in January 2015 incorporates \nlanguage that reflects this Paragraph’s requirement.  See, e.g., SCPD Self-\nReport, Aug. 2015, Att. 4 §§II(A)-(C). However, the policy contains additional \nlanguage that could be viewed as internally contradictory.  See id. § (VI)(C)(2) \n(“The Internal Affairs Bureau shall accept and review all allegations to \ndetermine if an investigation is warranted and the nature and extent of the \ninvestigation to be conducted.” (emphasis added)).  This should be addressed, as \nset forth below. \n \nNote: SCPD’s Compliment/Complaint Incident Report invites the reader to call \nIAB (or the Human Rights Commission) directly to report officer conduct. \n \nImplementation  \nSCPD has not provided comprehensive evidence of compliance with this \nprovision. \n \nComplainants’ experiences in attempting to file complaints orally or otherwise \nappear to be mixed.  One particular case may be emblematic of this problem.   \nAn individual stopped and given a traffic citation in February 2014 said he \nbelieved he was the subject of racial profiling.  The individual reported to a \nprecinct to complain.  The complainant reports that he waited almost an hour at \nthe precinct. The desk officer arranged for the complainant to speak with the \npatrol officer’s supervisor, but apparently failed to communicate this fact to the \ncomplainant; upon the supervisor’s arrival, the complainant was reluctant to \nspeak with another officer in the chain of command.  Ultimately, it appears that \nthe complainant left the precinct without any record of his misconduct complaint \nbeing taken. This is highly problematic. \n \nThe complainant later contacted IAB directly, and an IAB investigator took the \n40 | P a g e  \n \n\ncomplaint over the phone and entered it into a common database.  The complaint \nwas investigated. Notwithstanding, the complainant appears to have navigated a \nseries of steps before complaint intake was completed.  \n \nSee Analysis re Paragraph VI(b)(vi) for a review of investigation quality \nassurance.  \n \nA document request related to this Paragraph was pending at the time of this \nCompliance Assessment. \n \nRecommendations  \nSCPD should eliminate the phrase “if an investigation is warranted and” in the \ndraft R&P Chapter 5, Section 2(VI)(C)(2), such that the Subsection would read, \n“The Internal Affairs Bureau shall accept and review all allegations to determine \n… the nature and extent of the investigation to be conducted.”   Some  \nassessment of the facts alleged is required.  Determining that an investigation is \nunwarranted could be read to violate Paragraph VI(a)(ii).  \n \nAlthough all parties acknowledge that the complaint process can be a difficult \none for the officer and the agency, SCPD as an agency must welcome the \nopportunity to address possible officer misconduct.  If SCPD has reason for \nconcern that patrol, desk officers, or other personnel may be discouraging \ncomplaints, remedial action is required.  \n \niii. SCPD policy will explicitly permit parties other than victims to file \ncomplaints with the HCU, with the IAB, with any officer, or at any SCPD \nprecinct. Complaints regarding hate crimes or hate incidents will be \nforwarded to an HCU investigator for review and investigation.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicies  \nAnalysis \nThe language of the drafts of R&P Chapter 5, Section 2 and Chapter 24, \nSection 6 capture most aspects of this Paragraph.  SCPD accepts misconduct \ncomplaints from third parties, see SCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, Att. 4, §VI(B), \nand the Internal Affairs Bureau is notified, see id. §VI(C). Chapter 24, Section 6 \ndirects SPCD members to investigate complaints of hate crimes regardless of \nhow they are submitted.  See SCPD Self-Report, Jan. 2015, Att. 14.  \nNotwithstanding, the internal investigations policy should also include the \nexplicit language of the first sentence this Paragraph of the Agreement, as it \napplies to internal investigations.  \n \nThe draft R&P Chapter 24, Section 6 directs the responding SCPD member to \nnotify the HCU of a hate crime, hate incident, and/or non-designated hate \noffense. See SCPD Self-Report, Jan. 2015, Att. 14, §VI(B)(2).  The HCU takes \nprimary investigative responsibility for such investigations, with few exceptions.  \n41 | P a g e  \n \n\nSee id. §V(A). Notwithstanding, this policy should also include the explicit \nlanguage of the first sentence of this Paragraph of the Agreement, as it applies to \nhate crimes. \n   \nIt is unclear whether SCPD has adopted the draft of R&P Chapter 24, Section 6 \nprovided in January 2015; in any event, a new policy has not been posted to \nSCPD’s website.  See http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/documents/24­\n6.pdf. \n \nImplementation  \nSCPD has not provided comprehensive evidence of how it is treating third-party \ncomplaints.   \n \nWe have reviewed anecdotal evidence bearing on compliance with this \nparagraph. In one recent instance, a third party called to report an apparent  \ndomestic dispute.  SCPD responded to the criminal complaint.  The third party \nalso complained about the delay in response time and that the responding officer \ndid not take the call seriously. We have reviewed some documentation that the \nalleged improper conduct was investigated; additional follow-up may be \nrequired. \n \nIn another recent case, the crime victim had a third-party advocate during the \ninitial interview.  It bears specifying that the victim reported the crime, not a \nthird party. Notwithstanding, this shows that SCPD is taking some steps to \nencourage victims who may be reluctant to come forward. \n \nRecommendations \nSCPD should approve the version of R&P 24.6 attached to the January 2015 \nSCPD Self-Report, and post it publicly. \n \nSCPD should consult with community-based organizations that may be aware of \ncrimes or officer misconduct affecting Suffolk County’s diverse communities.  \nWe encourage SCPD to work with these organizations to develop a system to \nforward SCPD complaints and to troubleshoot the complaint process. \n \nWe further recommend that SCPD conduct outreach, particularly to minority \ncommunities, to ensure that members of the community know that this option is \npossible. \n \nFurther solicitation of third-party complaints will present new issues to SCPD.  \nFor example: interested parties, such as advocates for witnesses or victims, may \nwant to act as interpreters.  SCPD will need to enforce its policies on third-party \ncomplaints, victim advocates, and language access equally.  This may require \nsupplemental training, for example.  We encourage SCPD to present these issues \nas they come up. \n \n42 | P a g e  \n \n\n \n \n b. Investigation of Misconduct \ni. SCPD policy will ensure that all allegations of officer misconduct relating \nto discriminatory policing, regardless of the manner in which reported, will \nbe forwarded to IAB no later than 48 hours from receipt.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis    See Analysis re Paragraph III(b)(iii), supra. \n \nii.  Within 180 days of the Effective  Date, SCPD will review the staffing of \nIAB and ensure that individuals currently serving as or who are selected for \nIAB possess excellent investigative skills, a reputation for integrity, the \nability to write clear reports, and the ability to be fair and objective.  \nSupervisors with a sustained complaint of, or who have been disciplined for, \nexcessive use of force, sexual harassment, discrimination, or dishonesty will \nbe presumptively ineligible from assignment to IAB. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nThe second sentence of this Paragraph of the Agreement should be incorporated \ninto policy. \n \nImplementation \nSCPD shared information about the work histories, training, and disciplinary \nrecords of 17 current IAB staff, including the Commanding Officer and \nExecutive Officer, in August 2015.  See SCPD Self-Report, Aug. 2015, Att. 14. \nThis information helps supplement the staffing studies conducted and resolve \nconcerns about the discrepancies between the two previous studies. \n \nSCPD’s IAB investigators possess considerable experience on the force.   \nSCPD’s corps of IAB investigators has a collective track record for good \nconduct. Some investigators have a background in investigations at IAB or in \nother roles, including as detectives or crime scene officers.  Some have attended \ntraining related to investigations through New York state or the FBI.  Overall, \nwe appreciate SCPD’s efforts to recruit an experienced group of officers to IAB.  \nNotwithstanding, IAB concedes that the outside courses on internal misconduct \ninvestigation skills that it has tried in the past have not been a good fit for the \nagency, and at least in recent years, SCPD has not maintained such a training \nprogram within the agency.  Investigators appear to have had differing access to \n43 | P a g e  \n \n\ntraining on the investigative skills they need. \n \nInvestigators may be getting more uniform access to skills development through \na field training course that IAB is now implementing.  We have reviewed \ndocumentation certifying that investigators who started with IAB since June \nhave received direction on many of the skills they will need to execute on a  \nregular basis. Still, the certifications are only a one-page checklist, and do not \nreflect with any depth the instruction taking place.  We have not had the \nopportunity to observe the instruction or explore the program with the new \ninvestigators or instructors. In addition, this field training program only applies \nto new investigators. \n \nRecommendations \nAs we have previously informed SCPD, all IAB investigators should take \ntraining specific to their craft.  SCPD is in the process of implementing a field \ntraining course for new officers at its Internal Affairs Bureau.  At SCPD’s  \nrequest, we have recommended several off-site training courses that the agency \nmay want to employ.  We recommend that SCPD create a written training plan \nfor IAB investigators of all experience levels, and implement the same  \nforthwith. That training plan should include the Agreement-mandated training \ncourses on cultural sensitivity and language access. \n \niii. SCPD policy will require that each IAB investigation of officer \nmisconduct relating to discriminatory policing be reviewed by the Police \nCommissioner or his designee.  \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nSCPD has created the required policy, and the Commissioner has acknowledged \nAnalysis \nhis concurrence with completed discriminatory policing investigations by \nsigning them. \n \nSCPD has not adopted our recommendation to supplement its documentation of \nexisting chain-of-command review of completed investigations, such as through \na log that dates each supervisor’s review and summarizes their comments and \ndirectives. We renew that recommendation here.  Understanding what directives \nthe Commissioner and Chief of Department provide IAB may help reveal the \nsources of some of the delays identified in our Analysis re Paragraph III(b)(iii), \nsupra. Such a procedure should be captured in policy. \n \niv. Per SCPD policy, the Department will maintain a tracking system for all \nmisconduct allegations relating to discriminatory policing that does not rely \non personal identifiers.  Upon receipt of such an allegation, SCPD will assign \na unique numerical identifier to the complaint, which will be provided to the \n44 | P a g e  \n \n\ncomplainant at the time the allegation is made. SCPD will use the centralized \nnumbering and tracking system to track data regarding the number, nature, \nand status of such misconduct allegations, from initial intake to final \ndisposition, including investigation timeliness and the complainant’s \nnotification of the interim status and final disposition of the investigation.   \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD has created a numbering system for misconduct allegations regarding \nAnalysis \ndiscriminatory policing that does not require personal identifiers.   \n \nThe IAB is using IAPro to vet incoming complaints, and IAB retains \ninvestigations of discriminatory policing and other investigations of sufficient \ncomplexity or troubling allegations.  Notwithstanding, SCPD has not provided \nevidence, either pursuant to its semiannual reports or on-site, that the \ncomplainant correspondence, data tracking, or timeliness complies with this \nParagraph. \n \nSCPD may be taking one critical step in the right direction by implementing the \nCase Notes Overview investigation tracking sheet.  This form serves as a one-\nstop resource for investigators and supervisors alike to review a summary of the \nallegations and the steps that have been taken in the investigation.  SCPD has \nprovided such forms for twelve open cases to-date. \n \nData from the Case Notes Overview may allow SCPD to perform some of the \nanalysis required by this Paragraph. For example, dates regarding complainant \ncontact, the completion of witness interviews, completed officer interviews, and \ncompletion of the investigator’s findings will give at least a thumbnail sketch of  \ncase progress. The Research and Development or Information Technology \nSections may be able to assist in compiling this data in useful ways. \n \nOur review of actual outcomes suggests that investigations are proceeding very \nslowly.  See Analysis re Paragraph III(b)(iii), supra. \n \nRecommendations  \nWe recommend that SCPD review how the data from the Case Notes Overview \nsheet can be captured, analyzed, and produced to help achieve compliance with \nthis section, as described above. \n \nThe log of supervisory reviews and comments we recommended above, see  \nAnalysis re Paragraph VI(b)(iii), supra, may also serve as a tool to improve \ninvestigation timeliness.  Supervisors need to include appropriate complainant \ncontact as one of the bases for their review of investigations; although IAB \nintends to include complainant contact as one point in the Bureau’s checklist \ngoing forward, the chain of command above IAB also needs to review this \naspect. Likewise, supervisors should discuss with investigators the timeliness of  \n45 | P a g e  \n \n\nthe steps they are taking in the investigation.  \n \nSCPD should create a Complainant Contact Form that records the complainant’s \nessential information if a complaint is made verbally.  This form would be \nforwarded to IAB to make contact with complainant at appropriate junctures.  \n \nv. SCPD will maintain protocols to analyze and address trends in complaints \nrelating to discriminatory policing, including demographic data, lodged \nagainst SCPD officers. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD reports that the number of discriminatory policing allegations against the \nAnalysis \nagency is small enough that analyzing the complaints for trends has proven \ndifficult.  \n \nSCPD may need to look at longer-term trends in order to achieve compliance.  \nAlso, SCPD’s personnel working on trends related to discriminatory policing \ncomplaints may want to draw from the experience of the Hate Crimes Unit, \nwhich has been mapping hate crimes, hate incidents, and related data for several \nyears. \n \nCompliance with this provision requires implementation of the traffic stop data \nanalysis measures, and implementation of the two measures may complement \none another. See Analysis re Paragraph III(c), supra. The traffic stop data may \nidentify precincts where drivers of one demographic category are being stopped \nin disproportionate numbers. SCPD would be in a position to focus its attention \non these precincts, to identify reasons for these outcomes. \n \nvi. Six months after the Effective Date, and every six months thereafter \nduring the pendency of this Agreement, and thereafter every year, SCPD will \nconduct reviews of randomly-chosen, completed misconduct investigations \nrelating to discriminatory policing. SCPD must review at least 20 percent of \nall completed misconduct investigations since the last review.  The reviews \nwill be conducted by the Police Commissioner or his/her designee, but not an \ninvolved individual, and will require contacting the complainant to ensure \nthe investigation was handled in a professional and thorough manner.  \nDissatisfaction with the results of the investigation will be documented and \nthe case may be reopened if the complainant discloses credible new facts \nwhich would support allegations not addressed in the original complaint. \nThroughout the pendency of this Agreement, the results of each review will \nbe forwarded to the United States within five business days of its completion. \n46 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Compliance Rating Pending—Data Unavailable \nSCPD did not submit a report on completed cases during this reporting period, \nAnalysis \nas the few complainants declined to speak with the auditor.  \n \nIn May and September 2015, the United States visited SCPD and met with \nInternal Affairs personnel charged with investigating allegations of biased \npolicing and conducted a review of the discriminatory policing allegations that \nhad been filed. Our review disclosed several concerns regarding the manner in \nwhich discriminatory policing allegations were investigated.  In several cases, \ninvestigators did not make inquiries that the facts at hand seemed to warrant.  \nFor example, one recent complaint alleged undue enforcement of noise \nordinances against a local business. In order to make a thorough assessment of \nwhether the involved officers had targeted the business on the basis of the \nowner’s race or national origin, the investigator might naturally have visited the \nestablishment at a peak hour of operation, to assess the noise level first hand.  It \nsurprised us to learn that the investigator concluded the investigation without \nvisiting the business. In another case, the involved officers reported using \nelectronic control devices in a manner inconsistent with the actual usage as \nreported by Taser. Nevertheless, this was not a focus of the investigator’s \ninquiries. While not necessarily reflecting a lack of objectivity, the IAB needs \nto instill a culture that all appropriate  investigative avenues be explored before \nan investigation is concluded, particularly when it comes to assessing allegations \nof discriminatory policing. \n \nRecommendations \nWe recommend that, whenever possible, SCPD advise complainants \nimmediately after intake concludes that an auditor may contact the complainant \nat the conclusion of the investigation to get their feedback.  SCPD should make \nclear that the purpose of contacting the complainant is to seek feedback on \nSCPD internal investigations. (Of course, the investigator should be contacting \nthe complainant with periodic updates on the progress of the investigation as \nwell.) Properly executed, this advisory just after intake may set the \ncomplainant’s expectations appropriately.  \n \nFor complainants who are still reluctant to provide feedback, SCPD may also \nconsider utilizing an anonymous online survey tool.  The complainant could be \nadvised by email of the survey opportunity. \n \n \n   \n47 | P a g e  \n \n\n VII. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  \na. In all of its policing operations, SCPD will maintain robust community \nrelationships and engage constructively with the community to ensure collaborative \nproblem-solving, ethical and bias-free policing, and community confidence in the \nDepartment.  SCPD will maintain community and problem-oriented policing \nprinciples in its policing operations. SCPD will also engage the public through the \ndissemination of public information on a regular basis.  SCPD and the County will \nmaintain systems to ensure comprehensive, effective, and transparent oversight of  \nSCPD.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nThe quality and quantity of individual SCPD community engagement \nAnalysis \nprograms have grown and improved.  See, e.g., Analysis re Paragraph VII(b). \nHowever, community relationships have been built principally through the \nCommunity Liaison Officers (CLO) and Community Oriented Policing \nEnforcement Officers (COPE), and by members of Department leadership.  \nSCPD has demonstrated little to no involvement by the patrol and \ninvestigative units in community and problem-oriented policing.  Although \nthere are great benefits to having designated units to lead the effort, all SCPD \nofficers must appropriately incorporate community policing and problem-\noriented policing into their operations. To achieve compliance with this \nprovision, SCPD must parlay its successes in outreach programs and the new \nCOPE into building trust between the community and all individual members \nof the Department.   \n \nRecommendations \nSCPD should involve patrol officers in CLO and COPE events on a weekly \nbasis. Whenever there is a community event or meeting, a patrol officer or \nofficers should be assigned to attend at least a portion of the event or meeting.  \nThis will require relief to be provided to the patrol officer.  If it is left to \nchance, it is likely that the patrol officer’s time will be preempted by call load.  \n \nWhen CLO/COPE is aware that a particular issue or concern has been raised \nby a constituent or group, they should involve the appropriate patrol or \ninvestigative unit in meetings to discuss resolutions. \n \nSCPD should document efforts by non-CLO/COPE segments of SCPD in \ncommunity and problem-oriented policing.  For instance, several of the \nprecinct commanders mentioned participation in various community groups, \nbut no documentation was produced.  \n \n \n48 | P a g e  \n \n\n b. Community Liaison Officers \ni. SCPD policy will ensure that a Community Liaison Officer is assigned to \neach of the Department’s seven precincts.  A preference for selection and \nassignment of each Community Liaison Officer shall be given to a sworn \nofficer fluent in both English and a second language commonly spoken in the \nrelevant community, if any.   Each Community Liaison Officer will have \ntraining in the nature and scope of federal and state civil rights laws as \napplied to law enforcement activity. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nCLOs are detailed to each precinct.  During recent tours, we have met the \nAnalysis \nCLOs and/or COPE in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th precincts. As a group, \nthe CLOs and COPE officers are highly motivated and foster creative \ncommunity-policing strategies.  \n \nThe precincts with the highest concentration of Spanish language speakers are \nthe 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th . CLOs with proficiency in Spanish are assigned to the \n2nd, 3rd, and 5th precincts. While the CLO in the 1st precinct is not proficient in \nSpanish, one of the COPE officers in the 1st precinct is Spanish speaking. \nSCPD has analyzed its language needs using census data and English Second \nLanguage statistics from school districts, and assigned Spanish-speaking \nCLOs to what appear to be appropriate precincts.  A review of statistics on \nlanguages other than Spanish indicates that other language access tools (such \nas Language Line and training) may certainly be appropriate, but proficiency \nby the CLO in a language other than Spanish is not required.  One of the \nchallenges facing SCPD is to balance the need for a CLO to be effective at \ncommunity engagement with the need for language competency.  Based on \nthe CLOs that we met during the recent tours, SCPD is doing a good job at \nstriking that balance. \n \nSCPD has submitted the curriculum on police legitimacy that was used to \ntrain CLOs. Assessment of the training is ongoing. \n \nRecommendations \nA draft of R&P 26.1 provided by SCPD on September 3, 2015, captures the \nrequirements of this provision, in addition to the other aspects of the \nAgreement governing CLOs.  We suggest that SCPD approve these changes \nforthwith.  \n \nSCPD should continue to have Spanish speaking CLOs/COPE assigned to the \nfour precincts with the largest concentration of Spanish language speakers.  \nSCPD should also recruit COPE officers who are Spanish speaking to work in \nthese precincts when possible.  \n \nRecognizing that the language needs of the population of a precinct may \nchange over time, SCPD should incorporate into policy an annual analysis of \nrequests for language assistance in all precincts to determine whether a CLO’s \n49 | P a g e  \n \n\nfluency in a second language is appropriate.  SCPD will also want to bear in \nmind that the precinct where LEP constituents work may not be the same  \nprecinct in which they live.  \n \nFurther recommendations on training may be forthcoming once the \nassessment of current training is complete. \n \nii. SCPD will ensure that the contact information and duty hours of the \nCommunity Liaison Officers are publicly available on its website.  \nCommunity Liaison Officer hours of availability for contact with the public \nwill be during normal business hours. \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nAnalysis  SCPD has posted contact information and duty hours for the CLOs on its \nwebsite.  The website states that the CLO is available two weeks during \ndaytime hours and the third week during a 2-10pm “swing” shift.  See  \nhttp://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/documents/CLOContacts.pdf.  The \nwebsite also provides the CLOs’ contact information, including email and cell \nphone numbers.   \n \nWhile this information is helpful, the public is left to determine when a CLO \nis on daytime or swing shift hours. For engaged members of the public, this \nhas not always presented a problem: for example, a 2nd Precinct COPE officer \ndistributed her mobile phone contact to members of concerned parents \norganizations and neighborhood watch groups, and members did not hesitate \nto contact the officer. More reluctant members of the public may want to \nhave the confidence that a CLO (or COPE) officer will be available when they \ncall.  \n \nRecommendations \nSCPD should post a link that advises the community which shifts each CLO \nand COPE officers are working a particular week.  It could be posted in \nconjunction with the events that CLO/COPE will be attending a particular  \nweek.  Google calendar or another software platform could be used to do this \nefficiently. (Note: while this provision applies solely to CLOs, COPE officers \nare just as often contacted by the community.) \n \nSCPD should record a weekly message for the telephone number that is listed \non the website that informs the public which shift the CLOs/COPE are \nworking a particular week.  \n \niii. Each Community Liaison Officer’s duties will include the following: \n1.  Arranging monthly meeting of community residents to discuss issues and \nask questions regarding the police department.  The meeting will be attended \n50 | P a g e  \n \n\nby the Community Liaison Officer, at least one senior SCPD command staff \nmember, and at least one officer responsible for patrolling in that particular \nprecinct. \n2.  Each Community Liaison Officer will review, on a monthly basis, all \nconcerns submitted to SCPD by members of his or her precinct to assess \ncommunity issues. For those concerns that do not rise to the level of \nrequiring formal action under SCPD policy, the Community Liaison Officer \nwill notify the complainant that the Community Liaison Officer is available \nto answer the complainant’s questions and respond to any further \ncommunity concerns. The Community Liaison Officer will refer complaints \nof police misconduct relating to discriminatory policing to IAB.  \n3.  Each Community Liaison Officer will meet at least once every six months \nwith the respective bureau commander. During these meetings, the \nCommunity Liaison Officer will communicate any concerns or issues that he \nor she has received during the previous six months, along with any other \nrelevant information pertaining to SCPD’s relationship with Suffolk County \nresidents.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nPolicy  \nAnalysis \nSCPD has provided a draft of R&P 26.1 that incorporates the requirements of \nthis Paragraph of the Agreement.  See Draft of R&P 26.1 provided on \nSeptember 3, 2015.  We encourage SCPD to approve the relevant changes at \nits earliest convenience. \n \nArranging Monthly Meetings \nMonthly meetings are being held.  Often the monthly precinct meeting is \nbeing counted as the monthly meeting; this is appropriate.  The Commanding \nOfficer from the precinct is normally at the meetings and SCPD reports that \nthe Executive Officer is present if the Commanding Officer is unable to \nattend. Attendance by patrol personnel was reported by SCPD as being spotty \ndue to call load. \n \nReview Community Concerns  \nCLOs, on a sporadic basis, have reported the concerns they have received, but \nseldom is there a notation as to if and how they have been handled.  While it \nmay seem that a concern does not rise to the level of requiring formal action, \nkeeping records of all concerns will assist in determining trends that need to \nbe addressed.  \n \nSemiannual Bureau Commander Meetings \nChapter 26 of the Rules and Procedures has been amended to require a semi­\n51 | P a g e  \n \n\nannual report to be submitted by the CLO to the Commander of the precinct to \nwhich they are assigned. Deputy Commissioner Mention-Lewis indicated \nduring one of the United States’ previous on-site visits that she was meeting \nwith the CLOs on a monthly basis.  The issues and potential solutions \nemerging from these regular meetings should be captured in a periodic, \npriority Department Memorandum, for ease of reference. (This memo may \nlargely inform the annual CRB report under the Agreement.) \n \nRecommendations \nAs part of Tour Report system, CLOs should memorialize meetings they have \nheld. Further documentation of what they do when not attending meetings \nalso would be appropriate. \n \nDocumentation of the monthly meeting is fairly consistent.  The completed \nforms should reflect whether a command staff member and/or patrol officer \nattended the meeting. \n \nDocumentation of concerns raised by community members and how they are \naddressed should be part of a monthly report which can be used as the basis \nfor the semi-annual report now required under Chapter 26. \n \nIf the semiannual meetings are occurring, they should be documented.  \nDocumentation should include the concerns and issues presented at the \nmeeting, and the outcomes.   \n \nWhen concerns are noted that require formal action, action plans should be \nutilized to facilitate a timely resolution and documentation. \n \n c. Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) \ni. SCPD policy will define COPE officers as those who will be assigned to a \nspecific area as a liaison between the community and the police department \nto assist the community in solving neighborhood problems. \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nThe draft of R&P 26.1 supplied on September 3, 2015 incorporates the \nAnalysis \nrequirements of this Paragraph of the Agreement. \n \nEach precinct has a minimum of two COPE officers who act as liaisons to the \ncommunity and assist in addressing community problems.  They are no longer \nassigned sector car or patrol duties.  COPE officers report that this change  \nmakes it much easier for them to solve neighborhood problems, as they are \nnot diverted to enforcement. To the extent that COPE officers are still being \nused to backfill patrol shifts, work traffic, and perform patrol checks in some  \nof the precincts, this kind of backsliding should not take place. \n52 | P a g e  \n \n\n \nCOPE officers reported that they are conducting community engagement.  \nSeveral examples were noted during the tours and information provided. \nThese included: \n   Summer soccer program in the 5th Precinct; \n   Organizing efforts for a school year indoor soccer program in \nPatchogue \n   Bicycle rodeos in several precincts \n   Presentation of a heroin awareness program in several precincts \n   A summer camp in the 1st Precinct \n   Distribution of notices to shop owners about a recent rash of robberies \nin the 1st Precinct, and similar outreach in the 4th Precinct \n   Outreach events through school districts in several precincts \n \nCOPE officers also reported receiving community complaints and solving \nneighborhood problems.  For example, in one precinct with a persistent \nproblem in drug crime, COPE officers succeeded in working with local \nauthorities to evict dealers from an abandoned house and condemn the \nproperty. In another precinct, COPE officers coordinated with a shopping \nmall to ensure that SCPD devoted resources to monitoring crowds expected to \ngather for the release of a coveted electronic device.  \n \nRecommendations \nCOPE officers should not be used to backfill patrol, work traffic or do patrol \nchecks. If a COPE officer is used for such a purpose, a memorandum should \nbe generated which explains the reason why the COPE officer was diverted \nfrom regular COPE duties. \n \nCOPE officers should submit a monthly report detailing a summary of how \ntheir time was spent.   \n \nCLOs meet on a frequent basis and share ideas.  COPE officers are not \nprovided the same opportunity.  We recommend that a meeting of all \nCLO/COPE officers be held on at least a semiannual basis.  \n \nii. SCPD policy will ensure that all COPE officers engage in routine \ncommunity policing and community outreach, which may include: attending \nneighborhood association meetings to provide input or answers, attending \nschool functions to educate children about safety and crime prevention, \nassisting the community in solving non-emergency problems, addressing \ncommunity decay issues (abandoned and junk vehicles, graffiti, abandoned \nresidences and buildings, code enforcement violations, illegal dumping), \nmeeting with business owners to provide input or answers, and helping the \ncommunity to become self-reliant.  While COPE officers may be called upon \n53 | P a g e  \n \n\nto enhance patrol efforts, this duty should be in relation to a particular \ncommunity-generated request, need or identified problem and not as routine \nduty. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nThe draft of R&P 26.1 supplied on September 3, 2015 incorporates the \nAnalysis \nrequirements of this Paragraph of the Agreement. \n \nCOPE officers appear in many cases to be addressing the problems specific to \ntheir communities.  COPE officers in one precinct suffering from  \ncomparatively low levels of violent crime dedicate themselves to initiatives \nlike disrupting the heroin epidemic in the schools and tracking down missing \npersons. COPE officers in a different precinct with more street crime spend \nmost of their day responding to community complaints about potential drug \nhotspots.  See also Analysis re Paragraph VII(c)(i), supra. This is very \nencouraging.  \n \nAs noted above, it appears that some COPE officers are being used to backfill \npatrol shifts, work traffic, and perform patrol checks.  While in some limited \ncircumstances the traffic patrol or patrol check appear to be related to \ncommunity-generated requests, it usually appears that it is supplementing \nroutine patrol duties. \n \nCOPE officers presented calendars that indicated partial compliance with this \nsection. What is not clear from the calendar entries is what concerns and \nissues were raised by community members and how they were addressed.  \nCOPE officers should be able to demonstrate on a weekly, if not daily, basis, \ntheir interactions with the public and the results thereof.  We also recommend \nthat COPE officers be given sufficient flexibility to allow them to attend \nmeetings on weekends and evenings, as needed. \n \nRecommendations \nCurrently, activities are reflected solely on a calendar entry.  Most, if not all, \nmeetings should be recorded in a manner so as to reflect the issues and \nconcerns raised and the action plan for resolving the issue.  If other units are \nemployed in resolving the issue, they should be noted. \n \niii. SCPD policy will ensure that all COPE officers engage with individuals in \ntheir respective patrol areas; e.g., COPE officers assigned to patrol units in \nbusiness districts should interact with business owners, and COPE officers \nassigned to patrol school and residential areas should interact with school \npersonnel and residents, respectively.  \n54 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nThe draft of R&P 26.1 supplied on September 3, 2015 incorporates the \nAnalysis \nrequirements of this Paragraph of the Agreement. \n \nThis appears to largely take place.  During the tours, we were able to observe \ninteraction between COPE officers and the business community, \nneighborhood governments, community-based organizations, charities, and \nschool districts. School Resource Officers focus primarily on school-related \nconcerns, and are developing relationships there.  Other COPE officers rotate \nbetween different locales throughout the geographic areas covered by each \nprecinct, but have also been given the freedom to focus on repeated, \nsuccessful interventions; examples include one COPE officer’s interactions \nwith the business community in the 2nd Precinct, and another’s relationships \nwith the Latino community in the 1st Precinct.  See also Analysis re \nParagraphs VII(c)(i)-(ii), supra. \n \nCOPE officers in several of the precincts were using bicycle patrols.  The \nCOPE officers reported positive reaction from business owners and \ncommunity members. \n \nRecommendations \nAs noted in the recommendations in Paragraph VII(c)(ii), better \ndocumentation would be helpful in ensuring meetings take place and that \nconcerns and issues are addressed.  \n \niv. SCPD policy will require COPE officers to submit to their supervisors a \nmonthly activity report documenting the amount of time they dedicated to \ncommunity-oriented policing activities, the type of community-oriented \nactivities in which the officers have engaged, and listing the organizations \nand individuals the officers have contacted.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nThe draft of R&P 26.1 supplied on September 3, 2015 incorporates the \nAnalysis \nrequirements of this Paragraph of the Agreement. \n \nCurrently, COPE officers have calendars of their various meetings, but it is \nnot presented in the manner required by this section nor does it facilitate the \naddressing of concerns and issues. Nor do their calendars reflect activities  \noutside of scheduled meetings.  These should be reported as well. \n \nRecommendations \nSCPD needs to develop and implement a form that is useful for planning and \nproblem solving, not just documentation of meetings attended.   \n \n55 | P a g e  \n \n\nThe weekly activity forms can then be used as the basis for preparing a \nmonthly activity report which would comply with this section.  \n \n d. Community Response Bureau \ni.  Within 90 days of the Effective Date, SCPD will develop and provide to \nthe United States for review a policy that details the CRB’s plan for engaging \nwith the Latino community.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD has formulated a plan for engagement.  The plan requires additional \nAnalysis \ndiscussion between the parties. \n \nii. SCPD policy will ensure that each precinct has an officer representing it \nin the CRB.  \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nThe draft of R&P 26.1 supplied on September 3, 2015 provides that CLOs are \nAnalysis \npart of the CRB, but are detailed to the precincts. The policy must also \nrequire that a CLO be assigned to each precinct. \n \nIn fact, CLOs are assigned to each precinct.  \n \niii. Within 90 days of the Effective Date, SCPD will develop a survey \ninstrument in order to solicit assessments of the CRB’s success in engaging \nthe Latino community.  Additionally, each quarter SCPD will ask \ncommunity and political leaders within the Latino community to critique \nCRB programs and initiatives.  SCPD officers involved in administering \nCRB programs will also quarterly analyze participation and results.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSee Analysis re Paragraph V(h), infra.   Surveys have been distributed, but no \nAnalysis \nassessment has been completed and submitted. \n \niv. Using and analyzing feedback from the above sources, SCPD will produce \nreports annually that identify CRB successes as well as areas in need of \nimprovement and a strategy for making such improvements.  SCPD will \nprovide to the United States copies of these reports throughout the pendency \nof this agreement within five business days of their completion.  Within ten \nbusiness days of their completion, the reports will be made available to the \npublic, unless SCPD demonstrates a good faith reason for non-disclosure. \n56 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD produced the first CRB report with its January 2015 report.  That report \nAnalysis \nwas largely consistent with this requirement.   \n \nv. One year after the Effective Date and annually thereafter throughout the \npendency of this Agreement, SCPD will provide to the United States reports \nsummarizing issues addressed at community meetings and SCPD responses.   \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis  See Analysis re Paragraph VII(d)(iv), infra. \n \n e. Community Outreach \ni.  SCPD policy will continue to ensure that the Police Commissioner or \ndesignated high ranking officer(s) meet with key leaders in Latino and other \nminority groups on a regular basis both at SCPD-sponsored meetings and at \nmeetings held by minority groups. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD reports that the Deputy Police Commissioner attended many dozens of \nAnalysis \ncommunity engagement events during the recently concluded reporting \nperiod. These include meetings with nominal leaders of minority \ncommunities and advisory boards to SCPD.  The Deputy Commissioner’s \noutreach activities extend much further.  The Deputy Commissioner met with \nex-offenders, youth, parents, and other individuals and organizations, \nfrequently in communities of color.  We have observed the Deputy \nCommissioner participate in some of these events.  The Deputy \nCommissioner’s work will be a critical component in strengthening \ncommunity trust in SCPD. \n \nSCPD reports that the Commissioner and Chief of Department, by \ncomparison, attended one community meeting collectively  during the recent \nreporting period. We are acutely aware of the demands SCPD leadership face \nin running a law enforcement agency of SCPD’s size and scope of mission.  \nNonetheless, the Commissioner and other SCPD leadership must personally \nattend community meetings with Suffolk County’s diverse communities— \nparticularly those who have suffered strained relationships in recent years with \nthe agency. We have previously emphasized the importance of the \nCommissioner and Chief of Department taking up this mantle, and we renew \nthat recommendation here. \n \nSCPD has prioritized meeting regularly with Latino community leaders,  \nincluding a quarterly meeting at the Empire Justice Center at Touro Law \n57 | P a g e  \n \n\nSchool. We appreciate that this meeting has become routine. \n \nOne feature of monthly community meetings in those SCPD precincts where \nthe tradition is strongest: each monthly meeting commences by addressing the \nissues of the previous month in detail.  SCPD commands in these precincts \nknow that they must “stand and deliver” every month.  By contrast, this has \nnot been a strong feature of SCPD’s quarterly meetings with representatives \nof the Latino community. Although SCPD may address issues discussed at \nprevious meetings, it has not always been on the terms that the community \nexpected. SCPD leadership must continue to seek areas of common interest \nwith community groups, and follow through from one meeting to the next. \n \nii. SCPD will continue its outreach programs to all members of the \ncommunity (e.g. Police Athletic League, English as Second Language classes, \netc.) with the assistance of bilingual SCPD officers.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD continues a number of outreach programs, and has expanded programs \nAnalysis \nin ways that target the needs of a diversity of County residents.  The 1st  \nPrecinct CLO and COPE officers have continued a long-standing, successful \nsummer camp. Meanwhile, the 5th Precinct partnered with a local Latino  \ncommunity organization to launch a soccer league that is continuing into its \nsecond season.  We have also observed some of the other successful \ninnovations that SCPD mentions in its report, such as the Vamos a Hablar \noutreach events. \n \nRecommendations \nCLO and COPE officers should share program ideas and collaborate.  For \nexample, 1st Precinct COPE officers were considering starting a soccer league \nduring one of our recent site visits.  But these officers were unaware that 5th  \nPrecinct officers had recently implemented a successful soccer league in one \nof their neighborhoods. CLOs regularly meet together as a group with the \nhead of the CRB; this forum should be a platform for further collaborative \nprogramming. \n \nExamples of CLO/COPE’s outreach work abound, including events featuring \nbilingual officers. At this stage, SCPD needs to look to facilitate the \nparticipation of other officers in community outreach.  SCPD’s community \npolicing efforts will continue to grow among these officers. \n \niii. SCPD will engage the Latino community on an informal basis through \ncommunity events in an effort to maintain a good relationship with the \nLatino community. \n58 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis  See Analysis re Paragraph VII(e)(ii), supra. \n \niv. SCPD will solicit and receive input from the Community Advisory Board \nregarding the development of Spanish language training. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD reports that it has met with its advisory board regarding Spanish \nAnalysis \nlanguage training. \n \nv. SCPD will provide Spanish language learning opportunities for officers as \nwell as sensitivity and diversity training, including presentations \nadministered by Suffolk-based or local Latino organizations. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD shared during this reporting period that Spanish-language learning \nAnalysis \nefforts have proven cost-prohibitive, logistically difficult, or both.  See also  \nSCPD Self-Report, Jan. 2015, at 62.  This is unfortunate, as Spanish \nproficiency benefits both SCPD and its individual officers, both in ensuring \npublic order, addressing community concerns, and fostering officer safety.  \nSCPD has apparently willingly provided these opportunities in the past, but \ngiven the limited returns on investment, is understandably searching for better \noptions. \n \nWhile SCPD must continue to find ways to offer valuable Spanish language \nlearning opportunities to the entire force, SCPD may receive significant \nreturns on investment by focusing on providing intensive language training to \nthose officers whose language skills approach, but do not quite meet, the \nrequirements for certification as bilingual/authorized interpreter.  We will look \nfor SCPD to provide an update on opportunities for this target group in the \nnext semiannual report. \n \nCultural sensitivity training still requires additional development.  See  \nAnalysis re Paragraph III(d)(ii), supra. \n \n \nvi. All non-confidential audits and reports related to the implementation of \nthis Agreement will be made publicly available via the SCPD website and at \nthe Police Department, County headquarters, and other public locations, to \nthe fullest extent permissible by law.  \n59 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nSCPD has posted reports on its website related to implementation of this \nAnalysis \nagreement.  See http://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/information.htm.  \n \nvii. SCPD will collect and maintain all data and records necessary to \nfacilitate and ensure transparency and wide public access to information \nrelated to SCPD decision making and activities, as permitted by law.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD has begun to collect and analyze data in many areas.  However, as \nAnalysis \nnoted above and in SCPD’s own reports, identification of pertinent data to be \ncollected, collection of that data and analysis of that data is ongoing in many \nareas. \n \nf. Social media and notification systems  \ni. Within 180 days of the Effective Date, to the extent SCPD uses social media \nand related publishing systems, such as Nixle, to provide community \nmembers with information that includes emergency alerts, safety tips, and \nother public safety information, SCPD will ensure that messages that are \nbroadcast in English are also provided in Spanish or, to the extent \npracticable, any other non-English language commonly spoken by \ncommunity members, consistent with the requirements of Title VI. \n ii. SCPD will advertise the availability of such publishing systems to the \ncommunity using local and social media. \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nSCPD has broadcast messages and advertised their publishing systems \nAnalysis \nconsistent with these provisions.  See, e.g., https://local.nixle.com/suffolk­\ncounty-police---headquarters/; \nhttp://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/documents/NixleSP.pdf. \n \n   \n60 | P a g e  \n \n\nVIII. POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY \na.   SCPD  will  maintain  policies  and  procedures  that  are  consistent  with  this \nAgreement and that provide clear direction to ensure that officers and civilian  \nemployees enforce the law effectively, ethically, and constitutionally.  SCPD will \nensure that all SCPD officers and employees are trained and able to fulfill their  \nduties and responsibilities pursuant to SCPD policies and procedures. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAs set forth throughout this document, SCPD has revised some of its policies \nAnalysis \nconsistent with this Agreement, but others remain in need of revision, and \ntraining in many areas required by the Agreement requires significant \nattention. \n \nb.   After undergoing any training required by this Agreement, SCPD will ensure \nthat all officers who take such training will be required to pass a test demonstrating \na basic comprehension of the training material after it is presented.   \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD conducts testing at the conclusion of the training the United States \nAnalysis \nobserved.  The testing was generally appropriate to the subject matter \npresented, but at times did not test for real comprehension of the subject \nmatter addressed during the training.  Rather, the testing sometimes sought \nmechanical answers or sought information more for the purposes of \nimproving the training.  The latter is a worthy effort, but not the same as \nensuring that students comprehended the training.  Given the need for \nsubstantial revision of the trainings we observed, SCPD should review its \ntesting to ensure that it gauges students’ comprehension. \n \nRecommendation  \nSCPD should take steps to ensure that each training curriculum is \naccompanied by a test that will assess comprehension.  \n \nThe United States will submit under separate cover sample post-test questions \nfor the hate crimes training. \n     \nc.   SCPD policies and procedures will define terms clearly, comply with applicable  \nlaw, and comport with best practices. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis  SCPD continues to work to achieve this standard. \n \n61 | P a g e  \n \n\nd.  SCPD  will   apply  policies  uniformly  and  hold  all  officers  accountable  for \nimplementing and complying with SCPD policies and procedures. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nAnalysis  SCPD continues to work to achieve this standard. \n \ne.   Upon request, SCPD will make available to the United States any policy the \nUnited States wishes to review.  All policies and training curricula required by this  \nAgreement will be provided to the United States for review within five business days \nof completion or modification.  Within 60 days of receipt of any policy or training \ncurricula for review, the United States will notify SCPD of any concerns it has \nregarding compliance with this Agreement, the Constitution, or federal law.  SCPD \nwill  revise,  modify,  or  delete  any  policy  or  training  curricula  required  by  this \nAgreement that the United States finds to  be deficient unless SCPD shows, to the \nsatisfaction of the United States, that it need not do so.  If the parties disagree, the \nparties will attempt to resolve their differences in good faith. \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nSCPD has responded timely and appropriately to document requests.  Training \nAnalysis \ncurricula and policies have largely been provided to the United States timely \nupon  completion  or  modification.  In  certain  cases,  the  United  States  has \nprovided substantial commentary on training curricula, and SCPD did not \nrespond with related modifications. As noted above, training in the areas of \nHate  Crimes,  Bias  Free  Policing  and  Cultural  Proficiency  and  Language \nAccess require substantial revisions.  \n \nf.   SCPD will implement a mechanism to ascertain whether policies required by this \nAgreement are being followed and to measure the success of the revised, modified,  \nor  newly  created  policies  and  procedures.    The  mechanism  will  incorporate  \nmeasuring officer accountability and seeking community input as part of its metrics.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD  has  developed  mechanisms  to  test  discreet  aspects  of  the \nAnalysis \nimplementation of the Settlement Agreement, such as spot-checking precincts  \nto ensure that citizen complaint forms are displayed in Spanish.  SCPD has \nnot produced the comprehensive mechanism described in this section. \n \n \n \ng.  SCPD will ensure that all policies and procedures are available to SCPD members \nin an electronic format. \n62 | P a g e  \n \n\nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nSCPD has made these documents available to members through an electronic \nAnalysis \nplatform. \n \nh.   SCPD will ensure that all revised or modified policies, procedures, directives, or \norders  are  provided  to  SCPD  members  in  a  manner  that  clearly  highlights  or \ndistinguishes any modification or change within the text of the policy itself.  \nStatus  Substantial Compliance \nAnalysis  SCPD is carrying out its obligation in this regard.  \n \ni. After issuing a Rule and Procedure pursuant to this Agreement, SCPD will ensure \nthat all SCPD personnel have received, read, and understand their responsibilities  \npursuant to the revised policy or procedure, including the requirement that each \nofficer or employee report violations of policy.  SCPD officers will be required to  \ndemonstrate that they understand the revised Rule and Procedure.  SCPD will also  \nensure that all officers know that, if they need clarification of a Rule and Procedure, \nthey should consult with their supervisor.    \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD continues to work to achieve this standard. SCPD should develop clear \nAnalysis \nmechanisms to ensure that officers read and understand their responsibilities \npursuant to revised R&Ps. \n \nj.   SCPD will review each Rule and Procedure  required by this Agreement within \none year after it is implemented, and at least annually thereafter to ensure that the  \npolicy or procedure provides effective direction to SCPD personnel and remains \nconsistent with  the Constitution, current law, and best practices.  Each policy will \nbe marked with the next date for review.  \nStatus  Compliance Rating Pending \nAnalysis  Many policies required by the Agreement have required several revisions to \napproach or achieve compliance.  \nSCPD reports that the annual review is forthcoming.   \n \nk.   SCPD will ensure that Rules and Procedures made pursuant to this Agreement, \nincluding policy updates and revisions, are made available on its website in both \nEnglish  and  Spanish  and  any  other  language  commonly  spoken  within  the \n63 | P a g e  \n \n\ncommunity  within  180  days  of  the  Effective  Date.    Subsequently,  Rules  and \nProcedures made pursuant to this Agreement will be made available on SCPD’s \nwebsite in both English and Spanish within 60 days of each policy’s Effective Date.  \nSCPD may seek the United States’ permission not to post particular Rules and \nProcedures on the website if SCPD provides a reasonable basis for its request.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nMany of the policies required by the Agreement continue to undergo revisions \nAnalysis \nor have recently been finalized. SCPD has reported that these policies will be \ntranslated once finalized. \n \nl. SCPD will check its website for accuracy, formatting, and ease of comprehension  \nwithin 90 days of the Effective Date and then at least annually.  SCPD will ensure \nthat all applicable Rules and Procedures on the SCPD website are translated by a \ncompetent translator.  \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nSCPD is dedicating energy to reviewing and updating its website’s \nAnalysis \ninformation and presentation thereof.  SCPD’s homepage and main \npolicies/documents page each feature a link to a Spanish-language \ninformation page that includes a number of translated documents. \n \nWhile the homepage does still have the conspicuous button linking to the \ndedicated Spanish-language page, it no longer contains a direct link to the \nLAP or the Complaint form.  This appears to have been part of a larger effort \nto give the homepage a cleaner look, and may increase the website’s \nnavigability. SCPD should note such information its semiannual reports. \n \nSCPD should continue to improve the website’s navigability.  SCPD should \npost translated documents as soon as possible after the translations are \ncompleted. \n \nm. SCPD should ensure that policies are not duplicative or redundant and that \nwhen policies are updated, the policies they replace are no longer used and no  \nlonger  referenced  in  other  policies,  practices,  training  materials  and  other \ndepartment documentation. \nStatus  Partial Compliance  \nDuplicative or outdated policies have not presented a concern in SCPD’s \nAnalysis \ncompliance activities to date. However, SCPD is still working to bring its \npolicies into compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.   \n \n64 | P a g e  \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n \nIn January 2014, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Suffolk \nCounty Police Department (“SCPD” or the “Department”) entered into a Settlement Agreement \n(“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement”) to ensure that police services are provided to all \nmembers of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, in a manner that \ncomplies with the Constitution and laws of the United States.1  DOJ, as part of its responsibilities \nfor oversight of SCPD’s implementation of the Settlement Agreement, periodically reports on its \nassessment of SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  This is the fifth Assessment Report.   \n \nSince we issued our last assessment report in January 2017 (the “Fourth Assessment \nReport”), DOJ representatives from both the Civil Rights Division and the United States \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York reviewed documents and materials \nprovided by SCPD, including revised policies and procedures, copies of internal affairs \ninvestigations, a sample of entries in SCPD’s community relations daily activity reporting \nsystem, and other reports completed since our last site visit in the fall of 2016.  We also met with \nSCPD officials, SCPD command staff and other supervisors, and SCPD officers, toured precincts \nand participated in ride-alongs with on-duty officers, attended training courses, and met with \nmembers of specialized units, including the Hate Crimes Unit (“HCU”), the Internal Affairs \nBureau (“IAB”), and the Community Response Bureau (“CRB”).  We also held a conference call \nwith SCPD command staff, including Commissioner Timothy Sini.  In addition, we solicited the \nviews of the Suffolk County community, including the Latino community, by meeting with \ncommunity advocates.  In conducting these activities, we consulted with police practice experts \nwith expertise in the areas of policing covered by the Settlement Agreement.     \n    \nWe thank the SCPD officials with whom we met during this assessment period, and we \nappreciate the cooperation and effort that SCPD and Suffolk County leadership continue to show \nin addressing the requirements of the Agreement.  We also thank the many members of the \nSuffolk County community who have met with us and provided us with invaluable feedback.  \n \nThis Assessment Report is divided into two sections.  First, we provide a compliance \nrating for each provision of the Settlement Agreement.  Second, we provide a more detailed \nanalysis of SCPD’s successes and challenges to date in each main area of the Agreement:  1) \nbias-free policing; 2) hate crimes and hate incidents; 3) language assistance; 4) allegations of \npolice misconduct; and 5) community engagement.   \n \nAs set forth in detail below, SCPD has made substantial progress in implementing the \nrequirements of the Settlement Agreement during the previous rating period, particularly with \nrespect to its hate crimes quality assurance and police misconduct investigations.  In other areas, \nconsiderable work remains.   \n \nOver the coming year, we will focus our attention on the Department’s efforts in the \nsubstantive areas of the Agreement with which the Department remains in partial compliance.  \n                                                           \n1  This Agreement is available in both English and Spanish at https://www.justice.gov/crt/special-litigation-section-\ncases-and-matters0#police.  \n2 | P age \n \n\nWe will, however, continue to assess the Department’s work in the areas where it already has \nachieved substantial compliance to ensure that the Department maintains its progress in those \nareas.  In conducting our assessment work, we will continue to communicate with SCPD officers \nand command staff, both during regular phone calls and site visits.  We also will continue to \nmeet with community members, both during larger-scale community outreach meetings during \nour site visits and through ongoing meetings and communications with individual community \nmembers and representatives.  We will publicly report on our observations of SCPD’s \nimplementation of the Agreement in the fall of 2017 and spring of 2018. \n \nII.   CURRENT COMPLIANCE RATINGS \n \nSection IX of the Settlement Agreement provides that the United States will assess and \nreport on SCPD’s compliance with the Agreement.  See Agreement at 19-20.  The compliance \nratings below represent the United States’ current assessment of SCPD’s compliance with each \narea of the Agreement.  While Section III of this Report provides a more detailed analysis of \nSCPD’s compliance with the Agreement, these ratings are included to provide SCPD and the \nSuffolk County community with a clear and accurate summary of progress to date, as well as \nareas that remain most in need of attention.   \n \nThe definition of each rating type is as follows: \n \n•  “Substantial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance with most \nor all components of the relevant provisions of the Agreement.  \n•  “Partial Compliance” indicates that the County has achieved compliance on some of the \ncomponents of the relevant provisions of the Agreement, but significant work remains.    \n•  “Non-Compliance” indicates that the County has not met most or all of the components \nof the Agreement. \n•  “Compliance Rating Pending” indicates that there is insufficient information to make an \nassessment or the provision is not yet ripe for evaluation. \n \n \nStatus of \nSettlement Agreement Area \nCompliance  \nIII.

Training \nPending \n \nUnder the Agreement, the SCPD has committed to ensuring that its police services are \n“equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that promotes broad community \nengagement and confidence in the Department” and that all “members of the public receive equal \nprotection of the law, without bias based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or \nsexual orientation, and in accordance with the rights, privileges, and immunities secured or \nprotected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.”  Agreement ¶ III(a) at 4.  To bring \nthese provisions to fruition, the Department must develop and implement a robust system of \ntraining, supervision, data collection, and accountability mechanisms that ensure its law \nenforcement duties are being performed free of impermissible bias.  The SCPD has codified the \nprinciples of bias-free policing through its policies and procedures.  This is a necessary first step, \nbut as detailed below, the principles of bias-free policing must take root through the \nDepartment’s data collection and analyses, and its training program.  Because SCPD continues to \ndevelop the requirements of these provisions, the Department remains in partial compliance with \nthe bias-free policing section of the Agreement.   \n1.  Policies and Procedures \n \nWe previously rated SCPD in substantial compliance with the policies and procedures \nprovisions of the Agreement.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 6; see also, Agreement ¶¶ III(a) - \n(b) at 4-5.  As we noted then, ensuring that these policies are adhered to in practice will require \n5 | P age \n \n\nadditional work, specifically, through the appropriate data collection and training practices \nrequired under the Agreement, discussed below.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 6. \n2.  Traffic Stop Data \n \nTo ensure bias-free policing, SCPD must collect accurate traffic stop data and analyze it \nfor indications of bias.  See Agreement ¶ III(c) at 6.  Our last two assessment reports detailed the \nvarious shortcomings with SCPD’s data collection practices.  See Third Assessment Report at 7-\n8; Fourth Assessment Report at 6-7.  During our site visit in September of 2016, SCPD had \ncommitted to a plan and timeline for developing appropriate data collection methods consistent \nwith the substantive recommendations we had made about enhancing the data collected.  See \nFourth Assessment Report at 7.  This plan involved transitioning from a computerized data \nterminal system designed by an outside company to one that is developed and maintained by \nSCPD’s information technology department.  We supported this approach since it would give \nSCPD greater control over the data collection and improve the Department’s ability to analyze \nup-to-date data.  At the time, the Department projected that the new system would be up and \nrunning and begin collecting data in early 2017.  Unfortunately, SCPD was unable to meet this \nestimation, and the system was not operational at the time of our April 2017 visit.  For this \nreason, the Department continues to be in partial compliance with the traffic stop provisions of \nthe Agreement. \nWhile the new system was not operational, the Department provided DOJ a mock-up of \nthe re-designed interface. The current interface captures much of the pertinent data involved in a \ntraffic stop, and we made suggestions for additional data fields that would allow SCPD to \nconduct more meaningful analyses of the data and the legality of the traffic stops.  Several weeks \nafter our visit, the Department provided further information regarding the new interface, in \nparticular the drop-down values that officers will see as they input information into this system.  \nOnce the parties have agreed to the data fields and their drop-down values, the Department will \nfinalize the interface design and implement the system.  The Department estimated that it would \nbe able to rollout the system within a month of finalizing the substantive fields. \nAs part of our comments to the traffic stop interface mock-up, we recommended linking \nthe traffic-stop reports to use-of-force reports where a traffic stop led to a force incident. This is \nan important function that the Department should develop; by linking the two data sources, \nsupervisors and command staff will be able to conduct  thorough analyses of traffic stop and use \nof force incidents, and to determine whether any force incidents unnecessarily resulted from an \nillegal stop. There are technical difficulties to linking the two databases, however, since each \nuses its own unique identifier to track incidents. The Department suggested that it could issue a \ndirective requiring that officers provide the traffic stop identifier (“CC number”) in the “details” \nfield of use of force reports when a traffic stop results in a force incident. This requirement will \nfacilitate a more thorough and efficient review process for supervisors and command staff. By \neasily accessing related traffic stop reports, reviewers will be able to analyze the entire encounter \nto make determinations of the propriety of the traffic stop and force incident.  \nThe Department will also code the traffic stop data so that any stop report with a related \nuse of force incident will automatically require supervisor review and approval of the traffic \nstop.  Relatedly, we renew our recommendation that SCPD supervisors develop specific \nprotocols for the substantive review of traffic stop data as part of supervisors’ regular \n6 | P age \n \n\nsupervisory activities and that SCPD provide updated training for supervisors, many of whom \nhave not received supervisor-specific training since attaining the rank of sergeant.  See id. at 7. \nWe look forward to the next steps of this process and to the new implementation of the \ntraffic stop data system.  It is our hope that SCPD will be able to rollout the system soon so it can \nbegin collecting and analyzing data, which would permit DOJ to review SCPD’s analysis of \nseveral months’ worth of data before our fall 2017 site visit to provide feedback and to ensure \nthat the Department is properly analyzing the data.  \n3.  Training \n \nThe Agreement requires that all sworn officers receive training on bias-free policing at \nleast annually.  See Agreement ¶ III(d) at 6-7.  This training is to “emphasize that discriminatory \npolicing, in the form of either selective enforcement or non-enforcement of the law, including the \nselecting or rejecting of particular policing tactics or strategies, is prohibited by policy and will \nsubject officers to disciplinary action.”  Id.  The Agreement also sets forth specific elements that \nthe Department must incorporate into bias-free training.  Id. \n \nAs detailed in our last assessment report, SCPD suspended its bias-free policing training \nafter we determined that it was deficient.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 8.  To aid the \nDepartment in the development of a sound and effective training, the Office of Justice Programs \n(OJP) of the United States Department of Justice had agreed to provide SCPD with technical \nassistance in the form of training modules, specifically, with training programs on both \nprocedural justice and bias-free policing.  See id.  Further, SCPD has agreed on a training \nschedule that will allow all SCPD officers to complete both procedural justice and bias-free \npolicing within an initial two-year period, with bias-free policing training recurring annually \nthereafter for all officers. \n \nThe Department recently had a planning call with OJP to develop a work plan and \ntimeline for the training. On the call, OJP explained that it uses a “train-the-trainer” model that \ninvolves having its personnel show SCPD trainers how to deliver bias-free policing and \nprocedural justice trainings.  Under this model, OJP will deliver a four-day training; debrief the \nDepartment after; work with SCPD to develop an implementation guide; provide support to \nSCPD during the rollout of the training; and develop data metrics for measuring whether the \nDepartment achieves the program’s goals.  SCPD enthusiastically opted for an in-depth \npartnership with OJP that includes customized technical assistance, subject matter expertise, and \nsite-visits by OJP beyond the basic delivery, rollout, and implementation of the program. \nThe SCPD and OJP agreed to conduct the train-the-trainer training in November 2017.  \nWhile the trainings has taken longer than anticipated to coordinate, we are encouraged by \nSCPD’s desire to take full advantage of the resources OJP is able to provide.  Once SCPD \ntrainers begin to deliver the training, we will assess whether SCPD is appropriately tailoring and \ndelivering the training modules in a manner that is consistent with the terms of the Agreement. \nWe will review training curricula, observe training sessions, and meet with SCPD trainers and \nofficers completing the training to assess effectiveness.  We are hopeful that partnership with \nOJP is the Department’s first step in the process toward substantial compliance with the bias-free \npolicing training provisions of the Agreement. \n7 | P age \n \n\nB.  HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS \n \nIV. HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Training \nCompliance \n   b.  Tracking and Reporting  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Quality Assurance \nCompliance \n \nSCPD has made significant strides in the area of hate crimes and hate incidents since \nentering into the Agreement.  In our last Assessment Report, we found the Department’s hate \ncrimes training markedly improved and in substantial compliance with the requirements of the \nAgreement.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 9-10.  The Department has likewise now come \ninto substantial compliance with the quality assurance provisions of the Agreement.  Because \nSCPD is currently developing a new mapping system to track and analyze potential hate crimes \nand hate incidents, however, it continues to be in partial compliance with those provisions of the \nAgreement.   \n  \n1.  Training  \n \nUnder the Agreement, SCPD must ensure that all officers receive annual hate crimes and \nhate incident training.  Agreement ¶ IV(a) at 7.  DOJ previously found SCPD to be in substantial \ncompliance with these provisions Agreement.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 9-10.  While we \nwill continue to monitor hate crimes trainings to ensure that SCPD maintains substantial \ncompliance with this provision, we did not observe SCPD’s training in this area during this visit.  \nWe will note, however, that the Hate Crimes Unit (“HCU”) reported receiving more calls from \nofficers for incidents that might be a hate crime or hate incident, which is reflected in the \nincrease of incidents that were examined as potential hate crimes in 2016 (195) compared with \n2015 (125).  See SCPD Hate Crimes Report 2016 at 4; SCPD Hate Crimes Report 2015 at 13.  \nThe HCU reasonably attributes this increase, at least in part, to the training’s effectiveness \ninsofar as line officers are more familiar with this crime category and understand the importance \nof involving the HCU in investigations. \n \n2.  Tracking, Reporting, and Pattern Analyses \n \nA critical factor for SCPD to adequately and effectively combat hate crimes and hate \nincidents is the Department’s tracking and mapping of crime trends and crime patterns.  \nAccordingly, the Agreement requires SCPD to “implement a policy to track, analyze and report \npatterns and trends regarding hate crimes and hate incidents,” and to “produce a report mapping \nand analyzing for potential patterns and trends [of] of all hate crimes and hate incidents[.]” \nAgreement ¶ IV(b) at 7.  A robust, up-to-date, tracking and reporting system that is widely \nshared within the Department will allow officers to engage in pattern analysis and potentially \n8 | P age \n \n\nidentify hate crime patterns in their own precincts.  Until SCPD develops and implements such a \ntracking system, the Department cannot ensure that it is tracking and analyzing crimes to identify \npatterns or trends of potential hate crimes or hate incidents. \n   \nThe Department currently is developing a new mapping system, and it was not operational \nat the time of our visit in April 2017.  Previously, the County had been administering SCPD’s \nhate crime mapping.  The SCPD’s IT Department will now oversee and administer the new \nsystem, allowing SCPD greater control over the updating and analysis of data.  The new \nmapping system will present crime data at the countywide level as well as the precinct-level.  We \ncommend this effort, especially because the precinct-level data will provide officers relevant \ninformation about crimes occurring in the areas they police.  Indeed, COPE officers that we \nspoke with expressed that the precinct-level maps will be useful in helping them with targeted \noutreach to communities that are experiencing potential hate crimes or hate incidents.   \n \nIn our Fourth Assessment Report, we raised the issue that SCPD’s mapping system at the \ntime did not provide an adequate visual representation of the volume of potential hate crimes and \nhate incidents because each dot represented a crime at the geolocation where the crime had \noccurred.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 10.  Where there had been several incidents, the map \nlayered the dots, underrepresenting the number of incidents.  SCPD informed us that they are \nintegrating a “heat map” type feature into the maps to indicate the frequency of incidents at a \ngiven geolocation represented as colors.  The maps will also have more underlying data that will \nbe accessible by clicking on a particular dot.  Additionally, the Department has implemented our \nrecommendation to provide 12-month aggregate crime data on its maps, rather than data based \non a 12-month calendar year beginning each January, and will continue this approach with the \nnew mapping system.  See id. at 10.  These features will be useful in providing officers more \naccurate, meaningful data about crime patterns and potential hate crimes.  We look forward to \nthe launch of the new mapping system, and we are hopeful that it will aid the Department in its \ncommitment to analyzing crime patterns to identify and prevent future hate crimes and hate \nincidents.   \nWe renew our recommendation that the Department produce the annual report mapping \nand analyzing potential patterns and trends for all hate crimes and hate incidents on a bi-annual \nbasis to maximize the utility of the crime data in identifying hate crime patterns.  See id. at 10.  \nAdditionally, while we are mindful of the Department’s desire not to overload officers with \ninformation, see SCPD Compliance Report (March 2017) at 5, we emphasize the importance of \nensuring that officers have ready access to information about potential hate crimes and hate \nincidents.  We appreciate SCPD’s efforts to think strategically about the best means by which to \ndisseminate the mapping data information efficiently and effectively within the Department.  See \nid. \n3.  Quality Assurance \n \nThe Agreement requires SCPD to “implement a policy describing its HCU quality \nassurance process that ensures that HCU investigations follow proper techniques and \nprocedures,” and that SCPD will conduct random audits of HCU investigations and any \ncorrective actions taken because of the audits.  Agreement at 7-8.  As we stated in our last report, \nSCPD’s hate crime investigations policy aims to ensure the effective identification and \n9 | P age \n \n\ninvestigation of hate crimes, and this involves improving outreach and communication with \ncommunity members.  See Fourth Compliance Report at 11 (citing SCPD Hate Crimes GO 16-\n43).  Previously, we had raised concerns that hate crimes might go unreported due to a lack of \npublic awareness about what qualifies as a hate crime or hate incident.  See id.  SCPD is making \nsignificant efforts to improve its outreach to communities that have been targets of hate crimes or \nhate incidents.  For example, representatives from the HCU spoke about the difference between \nhate crimes and hate incidents at the Islamic Association of Long Island in March 2017.  The \nUnit attended another community engagement at a mosque that same month.    \nThe HCU has also created public outreach materials including a poster providing \ninformation about how to report a hate crime and a flyer detailing the elements to a hate crime.  \nThe HCU will continue to disseminate these materials at businesses and other high-traffic areas \nwhere community members are likely to see them.  It is important that the Department continue \nthese outreach and public education efforts, particularly in light of community members’ \nimpression that the Department is not proactively investigating incidents against Latinos. \nSpecifically, we heard from members of the Latino community who expressed concerns that the \nDepartment had not received any tips or investigated any crimes against Latinos in 2016. This \nraises concerns of an under- or non-reporting problem due to police mistrust or lack of \ncooperation.  We conveyed these concerns to the HCU, and it promptly offered to hold \ninformational meetings with interested community groups to discuss the legal standards for hate \ncrimes and hate incidents, and the Unit’s investigations of such incidents.  We also \nrecommended that the HCU develop a public service announcement for broadcast on Spanish-\nlanguage radio.  Vigorous outreach measures to inform and educate the public about hate crimes \nand the HCU’s investigative process will allow community members to understand the scope of \nSCPD’s efforts in this area.  These efforts will also increase the likelihood of cooperation and \ncollaboration in combatting hate crimes and hate incidents. \nThe Department has greatly improved its bi-annual hate crime audit and reporting.  See \nAgreement ¶ IV(c)(ii) at 6-7.  Our last assessment found that HCU’s report provided summaries \nof the investigations audited but did not provide any analysis of the quality of the investigations \nor “any corrective actions planned or taken as a result of the audits” as required under the \nAgreement.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 11.  The HCU’s most recent report, however, \nincluded information about the status of the cases, and what charges, if any, the Unit pursued.  \nSee SCPD Annual Report 2016.  The report also provided thorough case and investigation \nnarratives, facilitating a better and more accurate audit review process.  The audit sample was a \nrandom 10% sample drawn from the Department’s 2016 hate crimes investigations, which is a \nvalid representative sample.  The HCU, however, had also included a few other cases it deemed \nof interest in the audit report but had not noted this in the report.  We suggested clarifying this \nmethodology for the report.  We find SCPD in substantial compliance with Section IV(c) of the \nAgreement.  In the coming months, it remains imperative that the Department maintain \nsubstantial compliance with this provision and continue to strengthen its quality assurance \nmethods.  In subsequent site visits, we will continue to monitor this aspect of the Agreement.  \nWe commend the Department’s progress in this area and we will continue to provide support in \nadvancing its goal of ensuring that the Department follows proper techniques and procedures in \ninvestigating hate crimes.   \n \n10 | P age \n \n\nC.

Community Survey  Partial Compliance \n \n  As we have noted in our previous reports, Language Assistance is a cornerstone of the \nAgreement.  See Agreement V at 8-11.  Limited English Proficiency (“LEP”) individuals are \nparticularly vulnerable to victimization and marginalization.  Police officers and other SCPD \nstaff must be able to communicate effectively with them in order to provide appropriate police \nservices, effectively investigate crimes, and protect arrestee’s civil and constitutional rights.  \nSince our last report, SCPD has improved aspects of its language access program.  It has revised \nits already solid, comprehensive written language access policy; we offer a few suggestions \nbelow to strengthen it even more.  SCPD also has developed an excellent training program.  As a \nresult, our compliance rating has improved for several components of the language assistance \nsection of the Agreement.  However, at this juncture, SCPD still falls far short of fully \nimplementing the Language Access Plan (“LAP”) and does not sufficiently track or monitor \nprovision of language access services.   \n1.  Language Access Policy and Language Line Order \nSCPD has a strong LAP rules and procedures manual, which includes all materials and \ndirectives that were previously separately set forth in its LAP and Language Line Order.  See \nSCPD LAP, Rules & Procedures, Ch. 26, Sec. 5.  The Department has recently improved its LAP \neven further, revising the role and responsibilities of certified bilingual staff, tweaking its tests \nfor bilingual proficiency and Department Authorized Interpreters (“DAI”) and strengthening \nrequirements for documenting “Lima calls” (i.e., calls which may involve LEP individuals) on \nthe Online Reporting System.  However, SCPD needs to take additional steps to ensure that its \n11 | P age \n \n\nlanguage assistance policies are adequate and provide the needed services to non-English \nspeaking community members.  Thus, while the Department continues to be in substantial \ncompliance with the language line order provision of the Agreement, see Agreement ¶ V(b) at 9, \nit remains in partial compliance with the language assistance policy provisions for the reasons \ndiscussed below.  See id. ¶ V(a).   \n \n   In our last report, we recommended that SCPD authorize bilingual employees, not just \nDAI, to take LEP suspect, victim, witness, and complainant statements.  SCPD has adopted this \nrecommendation.  We also suggested that SCPD develop a network of multi-lingual advisors to \nensure that it translates documents accurately.  SCPD has tried to establish such relationships, \nbut has not yet fully executed this effort. \n \nWe recommend three additional changes to the LAP.  First, it should include a strong \nmessage that officers should not use children as interpreters except in exigent circumstances \nwhen there is no other option.  At present, the LAP is silent on this topic.  Second, SCPD should \nrevise the policy to clarify the order of preference of language assistance services that may be \nused.  The LAP does not currently prioritize the available language assistance options.  It should \nrequire that, unless an interaction with an LEP person is by telephone, SCPD personnel can use \neither a DAI or bilingual officer, and should use Language Line only if no in-person assistance is \navailable.  Third, the LAP needs to specify that written statements by LEP individuals should be \ntranscribed in the person’s language and subsequently translated into English.  The LAP should \nfurther indicate who is authorized to translate a written statement.   \n \nFinally, we recommended previously that SCPD prepare a summary version of the LAP \nas a reference for officers.  The SCPD has prepared a document summarizing the LAP, but it \nprimarily informs community members of their rights.  SCPD still needs to develop a simplified \nresource for officers that hones in on the key operational aspects of language access as it relates \nto their roles in the field, at precinct desks, during interviews, and in other settings.  \n2.   Policy on Persons with LEP  \nEven though policies and training have improved, implementation of the LAP is still \nlacking.  Officers still do not appear to understand when they are supposed to use language \nassistance services and too often fail to provide them at all.  Supervisors and commanders do not \nknow which officers under their command are qualified to provide language assistance.  \nContrastingly, the 911 Call Center provides language access services well.  \n \nAlthough the use of Language Line has increased every month and every year since \n2013, there are still substantial barriers to using this telephone translation service.  Officers \nreport that using Language Line is too time consuming.  Further, the cell phones SCPD provides \nofficers to access Language Line are old, poor quality flip phones.  We have received complaints \nfrom community members that it is difficult to understand interpreters because of poor audio \nquality.  Officers often resort to using their personal phones instead.  We recommend that SCPD \ninvest in updated phones that ensure effective communication with interpreters when using \nLanguage Line.  \n \n12 | P age \n \n\n We also commend the SCPD for modifying the Online Reporting System so that before \nofficers can close out all calls, not just Lima calls, they must indicate in a designated computer \nfield what, if any, language assistance services they provided.  However, we note that the system \nautomatically completes the field in non-Lima designated calls with “no language assistance \nrequired.”  We urge SCPD to eliminate this default.  A need for language assistance can surface \nat the scene after the initial call, and it is important that officers do not fail to provide proper \nlanguage assistance.   \n \nWe repeat a tip from one of the supervisors we met during our visit.  The supervisor \nsuggested that every precinct desk operator be taught to say the simple phrase, “un momento,” \nmeaning “one moment,” (and we would add “por español,” meaning “for Spanish”) before \ntransferring a Spanish-speaking caller to Language Line.  Apparently, it can take around a \nminute to connect a call with a Language Line interpreter, and callers are likely to hang up \nduring that silence unless they are advised to wait.  \n \nAdditionally, for the most part, the data SCPD is collecting regarding language access \nservices are unhelpful and incomplete and its analysis is inadequate.  The limited data collected \nshows that SCPD is frequently not providing language access services when needed.  Far too \nmany officers (upwards of 80%) report that they did not need to use language services on Lima \ncalls.  The Department has acknowledged that it is highly unlikely that only 20% of designated \nLima calls require language access.  Officers either are not using language access services when \nrequired, or at a minimum, are not adequately documenting their use.  Limited internal affairs \naudits show that officers are not providing the mandated services.   \n \nBeyond the raw data which documents the use, or non-use, of language access services, \nthere is little analysis identifying the root cause of the problem.  IAB’s review process, while \nuseful, is limited.  SPCD would be better served through use of a full data analysis that flags \npotentially problematic officers through an early warning system model and regular supervisory \nreview of language access data.  We recommend that SCPD hire or assign an analyst who can \ncollect, review, and analyze data regarding Lima calls.  Further, precinct supervisors need \ninstruction on how to review the documentation of language assistance, to flag problems and \nensure that officers provide language access services and accurately document their use.  \n \nSCPD seems to have overcome the difficulties it encountered identifying and \nimplementing appropriate tests for DAIs and certified bilingual officers.  The Department has \nbegun using a telephonic Language Line test to certify bilingual officers, and has developed an \nappropriate law-enforcement based exam for DAI.  During our visit, seven officers had \nscheduled times to take the new DAI test, and the number of certified bilingual officers has \ngrown.  We applaud these determined efforts and anticipate seeing a more robust bilingual and \nDAI corps during our next tour. \n \n   SCPD also can capitalize on the Spanish language test that is administered as part of the \nPolice Academy entrance process.  This test appears to be effective and more thorough than \nLanguage Line’s test.  Assuming that SCPD can confirm that the Academy test is consistent with \n13 | P age \n \n\nthe results of Language Line testing,2 and provides as robust an assessment of Spanish language \nability, we recommend that SCPD automatically certify as bilingual new officers who have \npassed the Academy entrance language proficiency test.       \n \nIn our past report, we recommended that SCPD conduct preparatory classes for \nindividuals taking the bilingual certification or DAI tests.  SCPD has not yet created such a \nprogram, and we reiterate this suggestion.   \nFinally, we note that SCPD still has not adequately addressed barriers to receiving \ncorrespondence, particularly complaints and compliments, in languages other than English.  As \nwe recommended in our last report, SCPD needs to better publicize its complaint/compliment \nsystem and inform the public, particularly LEP community members, that comments need not \nonly be in English.  \n3.  Spanish Language Access to the SCPD Website \n \n SCPD has done an admirable job of providing access to its website to LEP individuals, \nparticularly Spanish speakers.  Important information is a click or two away from the homepage.  \nThe Department is in the process of overhauling its website, and we expect that this will make \nlanguage assistance even more accessible.   \nSCPD also has done an excellent job of translating critical documents and providing \naccess to them on the website.  However, the Department needs to maintain better quality control \nover forms provided to the public in the precincts.  During this visit, we found that the version of \nthe LAP at the headquarters’ front desk was outdated.  In one of the precincts, we found \ncomplaint/compliment forms were missing in some languages.  In more than one precinct, there \nare still two different versions of the community survey available at the desks.  These issues need \nto be resolved. \n4.  Incentives for Interpreters  \nSCPD has recently circulated a memorandum that gives certified DAIs and bilingual \nmembers of the Department priority when seeking transfers.  This is a positive step, although \nSCPD had previously contemplated employing monetary or promotional incentives to encourage \nofficers to become DAIs and bilingual officers.  We look forward to seeing data-based results \nthat show that the transfer priority is an effective incentive or whether other incentives may be \nnecessary \nWe also commend the SCPD for eliminating a potential disincentive for officers to take \nthe DAI or bilingual certification tests.  In the past, an officer who provided language access \nassistance was automatically designated the primary officer on the call and became responsible \nfor preparing all associated paperwork.  As we recommended, SCPD now requires responding \nofficers to submit all reports.  \n                                                           \n2 We understand that in all but one case, officers who had passed the Academy test also met Language Line \ncertification standards.  The one outlier is re-taking the Language Line test.  We look forward to hearing the results.   \n14 | P age \n \n\n5.  Consultation with the Latino Community & Community Survey \nThe Agreement requires that SCPD survey community representatives regarding SCPD’s \nLEP efforts.  See Agreement ¶ V(h) at 10-11.  From our conversations, it appears that the \nDepartment, as a general matter, is doing a better job of consulting with community advocates.  \nAs noted in the community engagement section below, SCPD has substantially improved its \ncommunications with members of the Latino community through regular meetings at both the \nprecinct and department-wide level and through community outreach events.  However, in its \nmost recent Community Relations Bureau Report, the SCPD indicated that the community \nsurvey must be “overhauled” this year.  See SCPD Community Relations Bureau Report at 41.  \nWe support that effort.  The current survey is too long and the topics it covers need to be revised.  \nIn addition, the dissemination of the survey is not structured in any way to enable randomization \nand confidence in the representativeness of the findings.  Indeed, we found different versions of \nthe survey in different precincts during our tour.  \n6.  Language Assistance Training  \nWe were very impressed with the significantly improved language assistance training.  \nTraining personnel have applied the feedback they received from our language access experts; \nthe syllabus is now comprehensive and concisely teaches cultural competency.  Pedagogically, \nthe class now provides a mix of lecture, videos, and active exercises in small groups.  As a result, \nstudents—SCPD officers and personnel—are engaged and demonstrate significantly better \nappreciation of the material and the importance of providing language assistance services.   \n \nWe will continue to observe trainings during future monitoring visits to ensure sustained \nsubstantial compliance with the Agreement.  Going forward, the training should continue to \nevolve and be modified as necessary to align with modifications in the LAP (e.g., the \nDepartment’s policy regarding the preference of language assistance options, discussed above).   \nWe also recommend that SCPD consider and clarify what, if any, Spanish-language training it \nintends to provide officers.  As we noted in our last report, SCPD had been relying on limited \nSpanish-language training during the one-day training program pursuant to the requirements of \nthe Settlement Agreement.  See Fourth Assessment Report at 14.  It was too limited to be useful, \nand SCPD has appropriately abandoned it.  We have also learned that the Department is no \nlonger offering the 20 hours of Spanish language and culture training in the training academy.  \nOfficers have expressed interest in learning or improving their command of Spanish, however, \nand SCPD should consider offering a stand-alone course in Spanish for law enforcement. \n \nD.  ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT \n \nVI. ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   a.  Reporting Misconduct \nCompliance \n   b.  Investigation of Misconduct  Partial Compliance \n \n15 | P age \n \n\nSCPD has made substantial strides in improving its response to allegations of police \nmisconduct.  For example, the Department has significantly reduced its backlog of unresolved \ninternal affairs investigations; it has put into place changes to its organizational structure and \npromotional practices aimed at increasing the timeliness and effectiveness of its internal affairs \ninvestigations and enhancing the stature of the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB); and it has adopted, \nand most recently, institutionalized through official policy, practices for improving and \nincreasing its communication with individuals submitting complaints.  Based upon our review of \nthese efforts, we have determined that SCPD has achieved substantial compliance with the \nAgreement’s requirements relating to reporting misconduct.  SCPD has made significant \nprogress but remains in partial compliance with the Agreement’s requirements relating to the \ninvestigation of misconduct. \nWe offer below a discussion of some of the most noteworthy recent developments SCPD \nhas achieved in this area, as well as our recommendations for SCPD to continue to improve its \nhandling of allegations of police misconduct and to derive the greatest impact from the reforms it \nhas put into place.  We will continue to monitor the Department’s efforts in this area to evaluate \nwhether SCPD sustains its substantial compliance with the requirements relating to reporting \nmisconduct, and to offer our input as to how the Department can advance in its implementation \nof the requirements relating to investigating misconduct and continue to build upon its progress \nin this area, overall.  \n1.   Reporting Misconduct \n \nAs discussed in our last Assessment Report, SCPD has devoted significant attention in \nthe last year to ensuring that allegations of misconduct are reported and investigated.  See Fourth \nCompliance Report at 19-23.  Since our last report, SCPD has taken further action, most \nsignificantly by implementing an official policy requiring consistent communication with \ncomplainants to ensure that SCPD keeps them apprised of the investigation process.  With \nSCPD’s recent efforts, detailed below, we have determined that SCPD is now in substantial \ncompliance with Section VI(a) of the Agreement.  Although the Agreement’s provisions on \nreporting misconduct do not include express requirements that the Department communicate \nwith the public about its internal affairs investigations, we believe that increasing the public’s \nawareness of the IAB policies and procedures and the status of pending investigations as \nappropriate is an effective way of encouraging the public to submit complaints of officer \nmisconduct.  This also is crucial to promoting the public’s trust in the integrity and effectiveness \nof its internal affairs investigations.  Accordingly, we have evaluated and will continue to \nevaluate the Department’s policies and procedures for communicating with the public as part of \nour assessment of SCPD’s compliance with this area of the Agreement. \n   \nIn March 2017, the Department issued a directive memorializing its procedures and \ntimelines for communication with individuals who have filed administrative complaints about \nSCPD officer misconduct.3  The issuance of this directive reflects the Department’s \nconsideration of our previous recommendations to put these procedures—which were initially \nadopted last year—into formal policy in order to ensure that they are clearly communicated both \nto the IAB and to the community.  The directive requires that the IAB member recording the \n                                                           \n3 SCPD Directive, Order No. 17-01 (March 17, 2017) (copy provided to DOJ). \n16 | P age \n \n\ncomplaint in the SCPD’s database complete an “acknowledgment of complaint form.”4  The \ndirective further requires that the IAB administrative staff mail a copy of this form to the \ncomplainant.  We believe that this will help to ensure that individuals consistently receive timely \nnotice when IAB opens investigations of their complaints.  The directive also includes detailed \nrequirements for IAB’s communication with complainants.  First, IAB is to make contact with a \ncomplainant as soon as possible, and under ordinary circumstances, no later than within three \ndays.  Second, IAB will send a letter to complainants when it commences an investigation, which \nwill include the case number, the name of the assigned investigator, and contact information for \nthe assigned investigator.  Third, investigators will contact complainants when cases remain open \nfor more than 180 days.  Including these requirements in SCPD policy sets clear expectations \nwithin the Department and in the community regarding communication with complainants about \ninternal affairs investigations.  \n \nWe will continue to monitor this section of the Agreement to ensure that SCPD remains \nin substantial compliance, and to suggest additional ways that SCPD can bolster its effectiveness \nin this area.  SCPD can build upon its significant efforts to date by creating additional materials \nto communicate within the Department and to the public about other relevant IAB policies and \nprocedures, including, for example, its policies allowing involvement of advocates in IAB \nmeetings with complainants and witnesses.  SCPD’s public statements indicate that the \nDepartment has plans to create such materials, and we urge SCPD to follow through with those \nplans.  For example, SCPD noted in its March 2017 compliance report that it “anticipates \ncoalescing” the revised IAB Command General Orders “into a unit operations manual by the end \nof the next reporting period.”  SCPD Compliance Report (March 2017) at 8.  SCPD further noted \nthat this manual would include case management guidelines, consistent with the \nrecommendations in our previous assessment report about the utility of establishing such \nguidelines and making sure that all members of the IAB are aware of them and adhere to them.  \nTo be clear, SCPD has already adopted appropriate guidelines for conducting internal \ninvestigations, which is central to our determination that the Department has reached substantial \ncompliance with these provisions.  We agree, however, that there would be a benefit to \ncoalescing these materials into a unit manual.  Furthermore, we continue to believe that it would \nbe useful for the Department to establish case management guidelines to ensure that investigators \nand supervisors have an appropriate caseload, and we recommend that the Department develop \nsuch guidelines and include them in the future IAB operations manual.  \n \nSimilarly, we were encouraged that SCPD noted in its March 2017 compliance report that \nit is planning to “provide a brochure for public consumption which outlines the process for \nmaking a complaint and describes what to expect with reasonable certainty.  This effort will also \naddress the availability of language assistance and the involvement of third party advocates.”  Id.  \nAt a meeting in February 2017, Commissioner Sini also told the Latino Community Outreach \nCommittee that SCPD would create a public document with a bullet point summary of IAB’s \npolicies on the use of advocates and timelines for reporting incidents to IAB, and that the \nDepartment would post this document on the SCPD website in both English and Spanish.  At \npresent, although there is a one-page document on the “Civilian Complaint Procedure” posted on \n                                                           \n4 SCPD has identified this form as PDCS-1300-3. \n17 | P age \n \n\nthe SCPD website,5 the Department has not posted a Spanish-language version of the summary \ndocument.  We encourage SCPD to follow through with its plans to develop and circulate these \nmaterials, perhaps in partnership between its IAB and CRB.  We believe that such informational \nmaterials would be extremely useful in better informing the public about the Department’s \ninternal affairs processes.  Explanation of these process, combined with promoting public \nawareness of the positive reforms that SCPD has undertaken in this area, also will serve to \nincrease public confidence in the integrity of SCPD’s internal affairs investigations and of the \ndepartment overall.     \n \n2.    Investigating Misconduct \n \nOver the past 18 months, SCPD has made it a priority to reduce the backlog of \nunresolved internal affairs investigations.  The Department also has made significant reforms to \nthe IAB, such as restructuring the organization of the IAB and naming experienced detectives to \npositions of leadership in the IAB, aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of its \ninternal affairs investigations and giving the IAB a position of prominence within the \nDepartment.  In addition, the Department has put in place procedures for gathering, tracking, and \nanalyzing data related to complaints and investigations of officer misconduct, and has been \nregularly reporting the results of this analysis both to DOJ and to the public.   \n \nNonetheless, work remains in order for SCPD to achieve substantial compliance with this \nsection of the Agreement.  Below, we highlight and explain the types of continued progress we \nwould hope and expect to see for the Department to achieve substantial compliance with the \nAgreement’s requirements relating to the investigation of police misconduct.  See Agreement ¶ \nVI(b) at 11-12.   \n \nThe Agreement’s provisions on investigating misconduct include requirements that the \nDepartment collect, track, and analyze information about misconduct allegations relating to \ndiscriminatory policing, and that the Police Commissioner and the Department conduct \nadditional review of misconduct investigations relating to discriminatory policing.  As reflected \nin the Department’s own compliance reporting, including its publicly available annual report on \nits biased policing complaints, and information provided to us in response to our information \nrequests, the Department is not only doing a fair amount of tracking and analysis of information \nof its internal affairs investigations, but also using the information gleaned from this analysis to \ninform positive changes and improvements to its procedures.  For example, as SCPD noted in its \n2016 report on biased policing complaints, SCPD decided to expand the Department’s definition \nof “biased policing” to include discrimination on the basis of non-physical disabilities and \nlimited English proficiency.  SCPD Annual Report on Biased Policing Complaints (2016) at 17.  \nThe Department updated the definition after reviewing cases involving allegations of biased \npolicing and determining that its previous “biased policing” definition did not allow for the \naccurate classification of some of the misconduct complaints it had received.  Id.  Similarly, in \nconducting its periodic review of a randomly chosen set of discriminatory policing \ninvestigations, SCPD noted that “[c]omplainants frequently voice displeasure in the degree of \n                                                           \n5 SCPD, Civilian Complaint Procedure, available at \nhttp://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/documents/IAB%20Procedure.pdf (last visited May 5, 2017).   \n18 | P age \n \n\ndetail contained in the disposition letter[,]” as well as with the time periods between the \npresentation of a complaint and the initial interview with an investigator.  Id.  In response, the \nDepartment “is researching ways to increase” the amount of information it shares with \ncomplainants, while complying with applicable privacy laws, and also has instituted into policy \n“concrete timeframes” for interviewing and communicating with complainants.  Id. at 17-18.  \nSCPD has thus already implemented reforms in response to its analysis of certain internal affairs \ninvestigations.    \n \nThe Department must continue to improve and refine its analysis of information \nregarding its misconduct investigations, and continue to implement reforms in response to that \nanalysis.  For example, SCPD has reported the average length of time for completion of an \ninvestigation of a complaint received in 2016 was 176 days, with a range of 56 days to 293 \ndays.6  The Department should continue to collect and analyze this type of data and expand its \napplication.  SCPD should compare the investigation timelines in different years, measure the \nextent to which the Department is making progress in accelerating those timelines, and assess \nhow to conduct investigations more efficiently going forward.  Similarly, the Department should \ncollect and track data that would allow it to compare the periods for investigations of different \ntypes of allegations, as a means of assessing whether certain allegations are unnecessarily taking \nlonger to resolve than others.   \n \nFurthermore, now that SCPD has protocols in place regarding the timelines for \ncommunication with complainants, it would be useful for the Department to collect, track, and \nanalyze information about communication with complainants to ensure consistency.  In addition, \nwe would encourage SCPD to take a deeper look at trends in the types of allegations they are \nreceiving and the dispositions of those cases.  For example, the Department may consider \nwhether they are appropriately classifying allegations and reaching appropriate conclusions in \ninvestigations.  In our own analysis of internal affairs investigations closed between October 1, \n2016 and March 13, 2017, we noted that the Department did not find any of the allegations of \nbiased policing substantiated, and overall charges were substantiated in roughly 9% of the \nallegations.  Of the same set of investigations, nearly half of the allegations of biased policing \nwere determined to be “unfounded,” or to have no basis in fact.  We have not determined that \nthese outcome rates are inappropriate, but we note that SCPD should be able to identify trends in \nthe outcomes and handling of complaints, and to make observations about whether those trends \nare problematic, in using its information tracking systems.  Identifying information such as this is \ncritical to identifying trends that may require further inquiry and response.   \n \nFinally, we note that the Agreement requires that the Police Commissioner or his \ndesignee review each IAB investigation of officer misconduct relating to discriminatory policing.  \nSee Agreement ¶ VI(b)(iii) at 11.  In order for these reviews to be meaningful, and for the \nDepartment to achieve substantial compliance with this section of the Agreement, the review \nshould involve not only reviewing investigations to determine whether to approve the final \ndisposition of the investigation, but also to assess thoroughness and timeliness of the underlying \ninvestigation and any concerning material, such as improperly discrediting of the complainant.  \n                                                           \n6 SCPD Annual Report on Biased Policing Complaints (2016), at 5, available at \nhttp://apps.suffolkcountyny.gov/police/documents/DoJ/IABFeb2017.pdf (last visited May 5, 2017). \n19 | P age \n \n\nWe identified one 2016 discriminatory policing investigation in which the investigative report \nsuggested that the investigator might have drawn unjustified assumptions regarding the \ncredibility of the complainant.  In that same case, it appeared that the investigator had not \nconsidered or followed up on information that the complainant had provided identifying a person \nwho was allegedly both a witness to the underlying incident and a target of other discriminatory \nconduct by the officer.  The SCPD ultimately exonerated the officer.  We would urge SCPD and \nIAB leadership to ensure that both that investigators are meticulous in their work, and that the \nreview of investigations is substantive and identifies gaps in investigative processes.  Such \nreview would allow SCPD to remediate those gaps through further investigation or additional \ntraining for investigators.     \n \nE.     COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \n \nVII. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT  Partial Compliance \n   a.  Maintaining Community Relationships  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial \n   b.  Community Liaison Officers \nCompliance \nSubstantial \n   c.  Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (“COPE”) \nCompliance \n   d.  Community Response Bureau  Partial Compliance \n   e.  Community Outreach  Partial Compliance \nSubstantial  \n   f.  Social Media and Notification Systems \nCompliance \n \nOver this past reporting period, SCPD, and in particular, its Community Liaison Officers \n(CLO), Community Oriented Policing Enforcement (COPE) officers, and the command staff in \nits Community Response Bureau (CRB), continued to devote substantial time and energy toward \nits community engagement.  We continue to be impressed with the extent to which Police \nCommissioner Sini, Sergeant Kathleen Kenneally, and Lieutenant Matthew O’Malley participate \nin community meetings. We believe that Commissioner Sini’s personal involvement \ncommunicates to the Department and to the community that community policing is a Department \npriority and that SCPD is accessible and responsive to its community.  We also continue to be \nimpressed with the array of activities that the CLO and COPE officers planned and executed, \nincluding rolling out the “coffee with a cop” program into additional precincts and expanding its \nyouth sports programs to offer ice skating.  SCPD has maintained the compliance ratings it had \nachieved in the past reporting period, including substantial compliance in the areas of the \nAgreement directly relating to the responsibilities of the CLO and COPE officers.   \n \n20 | P age \n \n\nAs we have expressed in past reports, we believe that it is critical that SCPD continue \nmaking efforts to involve all of its officers and command staff in community policing—not only \nthose formally assigned to community engagement work.  In addition, we repeat our \nrecommendation that SCPD make efforts to be more proactive, analytical, and strategic in \nseeking to engage with less traditional partners and the more underserved parts of the Suffolk \nCounty community.  SCPD also should enhance its efforts to address current questions and \nconcerns of the community through outreach and distribution of informational materials.  In \nsupport of SCPD achieving compliance in this area of the Agreement, and to maximize the \nimpact and effectiveness of SCPD’s ongoing community engagement efforts, we focus our \ndiscussion below on the most noteworthy areas of progress and recommendations for addressing \nour most pressing concerns.    \n \n1.  Maintaining Community Relationships and Community Outreach \n \nBased primarily on our visits to individual precincts, we have the impression that patrol \nofficers are becoming more involved in community outreach events organized by the CLO and \nCOPE officers in their precincts, including attending the precinct monthly community meetings.  \nWe also learned that new recruits have an expectation that engaging with the community is a \ncentral part of their duties, largely due to the training on community-oriented policing they are \nreceiving at the Police Academy.  These are important and encouraging developments.  For the \nDepartment to adopt a community-oriented policing approach in a meaningful way, it is \nimportant for all officers, not only those specifically assigned to community outreach work, to be \ninvolved in their precincts’ community outreach events.  Training new officers that community \nengagement is an essential part of their work as law enforcement officers is an important means \nof incorporating community policing into the culture of the Department. \n \n  The Department and its individual precincts are maintaining a busy schedule of \ncommunity outreach events, including quarterly meetings with the Latino Community Outreach \nCommittee, monthly community meetings at the precincts, and popular programs such as sports \nprograms for local youth and trainings targeted at educating about the risks of opioid addiction.  \nIn addition, SCPD is continuing to meet its obligation of producing and publishing annual \nreports with its own analysis of the CRB’s successes, areas in need of improvement, and \nstrategies for making improvements, including posting these reports on its own website. \n \n  To come into substantial compliance with the community engagement requirements of \nthe Agreement, we recommend that SCPD focus on the following: 1) effective implementation \nand use, at the Department level, the CRB level, and the precinct level, of the computer systems \nfor tracking and analysis of community outreach events, and 2) creation and dissemination of \nwritten informational materials for the public.  With respect to the first, we recognize that SCPD \nand its CRB have been working to refine the computer systems they use for keeping track of \ncommunity outreach events attended by officers and SCPD leadership.  As a next step, we would \nexpect to see SCPD demonstrate that its officers are using these systems to accurately and \nregularly record their community outreach work and community contacts.  We also would expect \nthat supervisors at all levels would use this information to measure and analyze the effectiveness \nof community outreach, to appropriately share information across precincts, to identify potential \ngaps in their community outreach, and to strategize about how to improve the effectiveness and \nbreadth of community outreach.  Relatedly, we recommend that the CRB and the precincts work \n21 | P age \n \n\ntogether to identify and develop an effective means of consistently maintaining and sharing their \ncalendars of community outreach events.  At present, it appears that each precinct is handling \nthis differently, and that this may be impeding SCPD’s ability to communicate with patrol \nofficers about events, and to encourage attendance at those events. \n \n  With respect to the second recommendation, we note that the Agreement requires that \nSCPD “engage the public through the dissemination of public information on a regular basis.”  \nAgreement VII(a) at 12-13.  Although this requirement falls under the Agreement’s community \nengagement provisions, it need not be the exclusive responsibility of the CRB, or the CLO and \nCOPE officers, to bring the Department into compliance with this requirement and the \ncommunity engagement provisions generally.  The public information to be disseminated could \ninclude information about SCPD policies and procedures that relate to functions of the SCPD \nother than the CRB—for example, the policies and processes relating to how members of the \npublic may submit complaints about officer misconduct.  In meetings with the Latino \nCommunity Outreach Committee, for example, Commissioner Sini has committed to creating \ninformational materials “regarding the use of advocates as well as a timeline for reporting \nincidents to Internal Affairs that would be posted on our website in both English and Spanish.”7  \nIn this way, the IAB and other components must play a central role in helping the CRB ensure \nthe provision of informational materials.  Moreover, creating and disseminating informational \nmaterials to the public will not only help to bring SCPD into compliance with the Agreement, \nbut also should foster greater trust and transparency between the community and SCPD.  \nThroughout this report, we have identified several specific areas in which more transparency and \ninformation to the public would be beneficial.  More broadly, we also recommend that SCPD \nassign responsibility within the Department for identifying other types of informational materials \nthat would be useful to the public, for facilitating the creation of those materials in coordination \nwith the relevant SCPD component, and for determining how SCPD will disseminate these \nmaterials to the public.  In light of the significant impact this will have on community \nengagement, the CRB may be the most appropriate component for this responsibility.   \n \n2.  Community Liaison Officers, Community Oriented Policing Enforcement, and the \nCommunity Response Bureau  \n \nAs we noted above, SCPD has maintained a rating of substantial compliance with the \nprovisions of the Agreement relating to the responsibilities of the CLO and COPE officers.  \nDuring this rating period, we continued to be impressed with the individual officers in these \nroles, and we were encouraged to find that there are two bilingual Spanish-speaking officers in \nthese roles and that the Department is making further efforts to fill vacancies with bilingual \nSpanish-speaking officers.  SCPD has made improvements in response to our recommendations \nto increase the communication and coordination between the CRB and the CLO and COPE \nofficers.  SCPD has increased the frequency of meetings bringing together the CRB, CLOs, and \nCOPE officers, which is improving the communication between the CLO and COPE officers \nworking in different precincts. \n  \n                                                           \n7 Minutes of February 2016 Quarterly Meeting of SCPD and Latino Community Outreach Committee (on file with \nDOJ).  \n22 | P age \n \n\nTo achieve substantial compliance with the provisions of the Agreement relating to the \nCRB, and to maximize the impact of SCPD’s community engagement efforts, we recommend:  \n1) that SCPD develop and implement a community survey, as required by the Agreement, and 2) \nthat SCPD and CRB continue to make strategic efforts to infuse community-oriented policing \nprinciples throughout the Department.  SCPD’s progress with the development of a community \nsurvey appears to have stalled to a halt.  We recommend that SCPD make this a priority as it is \nnecessary to achieve substantial compliance with the Agreement and is an important means of \nmeasuring the effectiveness and impact of its community outreach and engagement.  We stand \nready to provide SCPD with technical assistance with the development and rollout of a \ncommunity survey. \n \nBringing a community-oriented policing philosophy to the Department as a whole will \nrequire the involvement of all officers and command staff, and not only the CLO and COPE \nofficers assigned to conduct community outreach.  We encourage SCPD to think creatively and \nstrategically about how to achieve these goals and demonstrate the adoption of such a \nphilosophy.  This may involve strategies and actions outside of the traditional community \noutreach events organized by the CLO and COPE officers.  We encourage SCPD leadership to \nthink about community policing more broadly than community outreach events; for example, the \nDepartment’s community policing could include building relationships between the Department \nand other local governmental agencies, service providers, and community advocacy \norganizations.  These community partners also can assist in developing training curricula, \nDepartment policies, and informational materials for the public. \n   \nCommissioner Sini has consistently recognized that building strong community \npartnerships throughout the entire Suffolk County community is critical to the Department’s \nability to effectively fight crime.  We commend SCPD for its efforts to date on building those \npartnerships, and stand ready to provide SCPD with technical assistance, including guidance \nfrom our subject matter experts, examples from other law enforcement agencies, and written \nresources, which may be useful to SCPD as it builds upon the significant progress already \nachieved.     \n \nF.    POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY \n \nVII. POLICIES AND TRAINING GENERALLY  Partial Compliance  \n \n The SCPD must “maintain policies and procedures that are consistent with [the] \nAgreement and that provide clear direction to ensure that officers and civilian employees enforce \nthe law effectively, ethically, and constitutionally.”  Agreement ¶ VIII(a) at 17.  While the \nDepartment is in substantial compliance with the bias-free policing policy and hate crimes policy \nrequirements of Agreements, its language assistance policy and policy on persons with limited \nEnglish proficiency continue to need work and thus remain in partial compliance.  As discussed \nabove in the Language Assistance section, we are encouraged by the steps the Department has \ntaken.  \n \n23 | P age \n \n\nThe Agreement also requires that SCPD ensures that “all officers who take [required] \ntrainings will be required to pass a test demonstrating a basic comprehension of the training \nmaterial after it is presented.”  Id. ¶ VIII(b).  The Department has met this requirement with its \nhate crimes training.  However, the Department has not met this requirement for its language \nassistance training.  And, as discussed in the Bias-Free Policing section above, the Department \nbegins the train-the-trainer training for bias-free policing next fall.  Thus, we cannot assess its \ncompliance with this provision until then.   \n24 | P age \n ",

Lee Dennison Building\n100 Veterans Memorial Highway\nP.O. Box 6100\nHauppauge, New York 11788-0099\nRe: Suffolk County Police Department Technical Assistance Letter\nDear Mr. Levy:\nOn September 1, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the U.S. \nAttorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York initiated a joint investigation of the \nSuffolk County Police Department (“SCPD”), pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“Section 14141”).  In accordance with our pledge \nto conduct a transparent investigation and to provide technical assistance to SCPD as \nappropriate, this letter provides preliminary observations, advice and recommendations to \naddress concerns regarding SCPD’s policies and procedures as well as certain policing methods.  \nWe addressed these concerns and gave you oral recommendations during our meetings with \nCommissioner Dormer and SCPD command staff in February and March 2010and on May 20, \n2011. We have not yet made formal findings, which will be contained in a separate letter.\nThe technical assistance provided below is intended to assist SCPD in its efforts to \nprovide constitutional police services,and are not mandates. Constitutional policing is a critical\nelement to ensuring public confidence in the police force and in promoting public safety.  These \nrecommendations were developed in close consultation with our police practices consultants and \nclosely follow the productive dialogues we have had with SCPD command staff and officers.\nBecause important aspects of our review process have yet to be completed, this technical \nassistance letter is not meant to be exhaustive.  Rather, it focuses on recommendations we can \nprovide at this stage of our investigation. We recognize that SCPD has already taken some steps \nto address ourconcerns, as set forth in the May 11, 2011 letterfrom County Attorney Malafi.    \nWe look forward to continued collaboration to address concerns about SCPD’s policing services.\n\n \nI.  PATROLLING AND POLICING \n \n  Among the issues that we are investigating is the claim that SCPD engages in \ndiscriminatory policing, that its approach to the Latino community discourages Latino victims \nfrom filing complaints and cooperating with the police, and that the Department fails to \ninvestigate crimes and hate-crime incidents involving Latinos.  While we have not yet made \nfindings, we believe that several SCPD policies may contribute to these concerns:  (1) Chapter \n16, Section 4, “Arrest and Prisoners:  Arrest or Detention of Non-U.S. Citizens or Persons with \nDual Citizenship;” (2) Chapter 24, Section 6, “Investigations:  Hate Crimes;” and (3) Chapter 13, \nSection 8, “Reporting Police Activities.”  Our recommendations for revisions are provided \nbelow. \n \nSCPD Should Modify Certain Policies and Procedures that Affect Latinos \n \n  We have a few global recommendations about revising policies and procedures.  First, we \nnoted that SCPD policy and procedure updates are circulated through “packets,” which may not \nbe the most effective manner to update officers about changes to officers.  For example, as part \nof our June 2011 document request we sought a list of all SCPD policies that have been updated \nsince 2008.  We received five packets (numbered 52-56) of the updated policies and procedures.  \nEach packet had a cover sheet which provided a very brief summary of changes, but no \nexplanation of the rationale or the consequences of the changes.  We suggest that the summary \ncover sheet provide a more substantive explanation of changes and the reasoning for them.   \n \n  Second, the revised versions of the policies that followed in the packet did not indicate \nwhere the changes made were found.  For this reason, we again recommend that when providing \nrevised policies and procedures, SCPD publish the revisions in a manner that highlights the \nchanges in the document itself.  Otherwise, officers are required to compare the prior version and \nthe new version side-by-side in hopes of gleaning the changes.   \n \n  Lastly, SCPD does not have a system that ensures that policies are reviewed on a regular \nbasis.  To ensure that policies are up-to-date and reflect the practices of the Department, they \nshould be reviewed every 6 to 12 months.  It is difficult to determine whether a policy is due for \nreview because the date of the last revision is not noted.  The form of each policy has a place to \nindicate its effective date, but it is frequently marked “N/A.”  Below, we provide comments and \ntechnical assistance for three current SCPD policies that should be revised.  These three policies \neither are too vague or provide insufficient guidance to officers to render them effective.  \nConsequently, these policies are a disservice to SCPD officers and the Suffolk County \ncommunity as a whole. \n \n(1) Chapter 16, Section 4:  Arrest and Prisoners:  Arrest or Detention of Non-U.S. Citizens \nor Persons with Dual Citizenship   \n \nSCPD policy that governs the collection and use of information regarding the \nimmigration status of witnesses, victims and suspects is too vague to provide officers \nwith necessary guidance and is subject to abuse.   \n \n2 \n \n\n \n  SCPD policy and procedure prohibits officers from questioning witnesses and victims \nabout their immigration status but requires SCPD officers to question a person arrested for a \ncrime regarding his or her immigration status, regardless of the charge, “when there is reason to \nbelieve” that the arrestee is an “undocumented person.”  Chapter 16, section 4.  Specifically, the \npolicy section of Chapter 16, Section 4 states the following: \n \nWhen there is reason to believe that an individual arrested for a criminal offense \nmay be an undocumented person, the Police Department is responsible for \nalerting federal immigration officials, the prosecuting attorney, and the judiciary.  \nWhile enforcement of immigration laws is primarily a federal responsibility, \nState, County and local law enforcement agencies necessarily and appropriately \nshould inquire about a person’s immigration status under certain circumstances \n(emphasis added).   \n \nThis policy is too vague and offers little or no guidance on how to determine whether there is \nreason to believe that an individual is an “undocumented person.”  Without more clarification, \nthis policy is vulnerable to abuse and exposes SCPD to allegations of racial profiling and \npotential legal action for discrimination on the basis of national origin. \n \nThe weakness of SCPD policy is further highlighted by Paragraph VI.(A), \n“Procedure,” of Chapter 16, Section 4 which provides for SCPD officers to determine if \nan arrestee “was born outside the country.”   It states: \n \nArrests of Non-U.S. Citizens -- When processing an arrest for a felony or \nmisdemeanor and the processing officer knows or reasonably suspects the \ndefendant was born outside the country, the following procedure will be \nfollowed…. (emphasis added). \n \n  The standard for determining whether a person was “born outside the country” also is \nambiguous.  For example, an officer may inappropriately rely on a person’s apparent ethnicity, \nrace, or even language or manner of speech as the basis for making this determination.  There is \nno standard for determining whether an individual has been born outside the United States.  \nMoreover, implementing this procedure would compel officers to question all individuals, \nincluding those who may have been born in a foreign country but who are presently U.S. \nCitizens, Permanent Residents, or those authorized to work, study or reside in the United States  \n(for example, individuals who are naturalized U.S. citizens.)  SCPD should revise the policy and \nprocedure language of Chapter 16 and the training provided to officers related to these \nprovisions.  \n \n  As we noted during our conversation with you on May 20, 2011, it is our understanding \nthat as of February 2011, Suffolk County has become an activated jurisdiction as part of “Secure \nCommunities,” a state and federal partnership administered by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.1  Due to the possibility that this may raise fears in the Latino community, we \nrecommend that SCPD, through outreach to the community, explain what joining “Secure \n                                                 \n1    United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “activated jurisdictions,” available \nat www.ice.gov/secure_communities/ (last accessed 07/25/2011). \n3 \n \n\n \nCommunities” means and what SCPD would be doing, if anything, differently.  We made this \nrecommendation during our May 20, 2011, meeting and you stated that you believed that there \nwas no concern within the Latino community about SCPD’s joining “Secure Communities.”  \nHowever, there appears to be a lack of communication between the Latino community and \nSCPD and that concerns do exist regarding SCPD’s participation in this program.   \n \nLastly, we encourage SCPD to expand its list of embassies attached to Chapter 16, \nSection 4.  SCPD uses this list to meet its obligation to notify the appropriate embassy if a \nforeign citizen is arrested.  The list at present includes only one Spanish speaking country, Costa \nRica.  As Suffolk County has a large population of individuals from South and Central America, \nwe recommend reaching out to consular offices for Spanish speaking countries, including \nMexico, El Salvador, Ecuador, Peru, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, and Colombia. \n \n(2) Chapter 24, Section 6:  “Investigative Operations of Hate Crimes”   \n \nSCPD policy that governs the investigative procedure of the Hate Crimes Unit is \ninconsistent with SCPD’s duty to provide Limited English Proficiency (“LEP”) \nindividuals with adequate services. \n \nAs currently written, this departmental order requires that “[i]n every case where a hate \ncrimes unit investigator is consulted and determines that an incident is not a hate crime, an \ninvestigator from the hate crimes unit will conduct an in person follow-up interview with the \ncomplainant.” (emphasis added).  During our investigation it appeared that, despite the order, \nhate crimes detectives rarely conduct an in-person follow-up interview with complainants.  \nIndeed, during the course of our interviews, we spoke with victims and individuals who \ncomplained that they did not receive any form of follow-up interview by SCPD for incidents that \nthey perceived to be bias-related and potential hate crimes.   \n \nTo address this issue, we recommend SCPD revise or modify this policy to require its \nHate Crimes Unit (“HCU”) to contact all hate crimes victims and possible victims, but to allow \nthese contacts to be either in person or via telephone.  SCPD should also mandate that these \ncontacts be made within a specific time frame and be documented to demonstrate that procedure \nwas followed.  Further, we strongly recommend that SCPD develop a quality assurance \nmechanism to prompt detectives to contact victims or possible victims with status updates at \nperiodic, reasonable intervals.  This will ensure that victims are kept abreast of the status of \ninvestigations and build trust with residents.  To ensure effective communication with victims \nwho are LEP, detectives must use language assistance services, such as competent bilingual staff \nor telephonic interpreter services.  We commend SCPD for implementing measures to this end, \nsuch as the installation of interpreter cell phones in some police patrol units and the installation \nof interpreter telephones in public police facilities, as mentioned in County Attorney Malafi’s \nMay 11, 2011 letter. However, we have received reports that these services are not always \navailable, or that individuals with LEP needs have not been given access to such services.  This \nwill be discussed further in our formal findings letter. \n \nWe also recommend that the supervisor(s) of the HCU routinely conduct random audits \nof hate crime investigations each month.  The routine audit should, focus on among other things, \nthe quality of the investigation and whether officers make contact with victims or alleged victims \n4 \n \n\n \nor at least attempt to make contact and are accurately documenting their efforts.  This additional \nlevel of scrutiny also will help ensure that victims are kept informed.  \n \n(3) Chapter 13, Section 8:  Reporting Police Activities   \n \nSCPD policy that governs when an officer is required to make a report of an \nincident is too vague with regard to the term “Youth Disturbances,” and it likely \nwill result in underreporting and inadequate tracking of hate or bias incidents by \nyouths against immigrant individuals. \n \n  Departmental policies permit officers to fail to report incidents even though the \ninformation gathered may be useful for investigative purposes.   This raises a particular concern \nwith respect to hate crimes.  Currently, officers may “dispose of a call” and not prepare a field \nreport with respect to:   \n \n(3)  Calls which are non-criminal (no offense committed), and \n  (a) Have either an anonymous complainant or a complainant that declines/refuses an \n  interview or is not physically present, or \n  (b) Have a complainant, and the information provided by the complainant does not \n  necessitate the preparation of a Field Report, such as: \n  (1)  Youth Disturbances. . . . \n   \nSee Paragraph VI(7)(a)(1)-(3) of Chapter 13, Section 8. \n \nWe strongly recommend that SCPD modify Chapter 13, Section 8 to eliminate the use of \nthe term “non-criminal.”  The current “non-criminal” label may diminish the level of \ninvestigation given to a matter.  Merely because a complainant is reticent, anonymous or no \nlonger available does not properly obviate the need for accurate reporting.  Indeed, there are \nmany victims in the immigrant community who may be reluctant to cooperate, terming a matter \n“non-criminal” may also be unintentionally affecting the County’s ability to assess how many \nhate crimes or incidents may be occurring at any given time.   \n \nFurther, we also recommend that SCPD delete (a)(3)(b)(1) which lists “Youth \nDisturbances” as one of the instances in which officers are not required to prepare a field report \neven though they receive a complaint.  The term “Youth Disturbances” is vague and undefined \nand could result in SCPD missing critical patterns of crime.  For example, if an officer were \ncalled to a scene of a man being shot at by youths carrying BB guns and the youths then ran \naway, that officer might describe the incident as a “Youth Disturbance.”  In fact, the offense \nitself could be a precursor to a more severe string of violence by those youths.  Our example is \nnot hypothetical, but rather taken from the facts prior to the death of Marcelo Lucero in \nNovember 2008.  As you will recall, after the death of Mr. Lucero, other Latino men came \nforward and claimed that they had been attacked (glass bottles thrown at them, being harassed, or \nhaving BB guns shot at them) by the same teenagers.  One Latino man in particular claimed that \nhe had been shot at by youths with a BB gun on the same evening and alleged that SCPD had \ncalled the incident a “disturbance.”   \n \n5 \n \n\n \nIn making this recommendation, we highlight that individuals have informed us that the \nresponse time of SCPD can be long and, because of prior experience waiting for police services, \nvictims often leave the scenes even if injured.  One victim told us that he called the police after \nbeing attacked by a group of youths, but he left the scene after waiting thirty minutes for the \npolice to arrive.  He was bleeding and needed to return home to care for the injury to his face.   \n \nIn such an instance, even if the individual left the scene, SCPD should capture as much \ninformation and/or documentation as possible and prepare a field report or an abbreviated police \nreport.  The abbreviated police report would include the reason for the service call (i.e. robbery) \nwith the notation of “victim declined to be interviewed,” or “victim gone,” and could then be \ntracked electronically to determine any pattern of crimes, types of crimes, or if certain areas are \nbeing sought out by criminals despite not having testimonials from victims.  Additionally, we \nrecommend SCPD seek ways to minimize response time for victim calls.2 \n \nII.  HATE CRIMES UNIT \n \nHate crimes can have a debilitating effect on a community.  When these types of crimes \ngo unaddressed, community members quickly develop a perception of police apathy that \nundermines the ability of the force to protect the community.  During our interviews with \nmembers of the immigrant community, we found that many felt that “immigrant bashing” was \nabetted by SCPD through inaction.  Our review of SCPD policies has revealed at least three \nfactors that contribute to inadequate hate crime response:  (1) Erroneous reporting of hate crimes \nfrom SCPD to New York State, (2) Vague and conflicting instruction and policies to officers \nregarding hate crimes, and (3) Insufficient mechanisms and processes for tracking hate \ncrimes/incidents and following up on hate crime/incident complaints.  Although we commend \nSCPD for establishing a dedicated county-wide Hate Crimes Unit, we recommend that SCPD \ncontinue to develop a more effective response to hate crimes and bias incidents.   \n    \nA) SCPD’s Hate Crimes Unit Has Long Misunderstood How to Report Hate Crimes, and \nthere is No Indication that the Problems Have Been Fully Rectified  \n \nA June 2004 letter from Mr. James Seymour, New York State Hate Crimes Reporting \nCoordinator, to SCPD illustrates that SCPD, in the fairly recent past, has not been correctly \nreporting hate crimes to the NYS Department of Criminal Justice Systems (“DCJS”).  \nMr. Seymour’s memorandum stated that:  \n \n“[s]ome of your reported Making Graffiti incidents comments noted Anti-Jewish \nor Anti-Black symbols were drawn.  If the officer had charged PL 145.00 \nCriminal Mischief 4th instead of or in addition to Making Graffiti, the incident \nwould be considered a hate crime.  Charge PL 145.60 [(Making Graffiti)] only \nand it is not recognized as a hate crime.”3   \n                                                 \n2   Although we cannot confirm how long the victims we interviewed waited for police \nassistance, we believe, based on victims’ statements and SCPD officers’ representations, that \nthere are not enough officers patrolling the streets and that extended delays in service do occur. \n3   The New York State Hate Crimes Statute, New York Penal Law § 485, provides, \ngenerally, for the enhancement of the penalties for certain “specified offenses” when the \n6 \n \n\n \n \nTherefore, because the officers who initially responded to these incidents did not charge \nthe incidents correctly as specified offenses defined by the statute, the incidents were “not \ncounted” as hate crimes.  New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, Memorandum \nto Detective/Sargent [sic] Robert Reecks, Suffolk County PD, June 14, 2004. \n \n  It appears from this letter that SCPD was sensitive to hate crimes in 2003, but lacked a \nprocedural or legal understanding of what type of charged offense could be recognized as a hate \ncrime.  Because this is a matter which could possibly be addressed by training, DOJ requests that \nSCPD submit documentation illustrating the concrete steps it has taken to improve training \nregarding charging hate crimes.  DOJ recognizes that SCPD may have improved its ability to \ncorrectly report hate crimes to NYS DCJS in the seven years since this letter was written.   \n \nB) Definitions and Examples of Hate Crimes Provided in Various Policy and Instructional \n  Documents are Vague and Inconsistent \n  \nIn addition to the mistakes that have been discovered in SCPD’s external reporting \nmechanisms, SCPD’s internal guidance with respect to hate crimes is vague and inconsistent.  \nSCPD presents its descriptions of hate crimes law in ways that may be confusing to officers \nbecause the definitions are frequently inconsistent and inadequately explained.  For example, in \nthe sheet titled “Hate Crimes Q&A,” the following question and answer dialogue appears:  \n \nQ: “Is painting/drawing of a swastika on a public place an example of a hate crime?” \nA: “Only if it’s specifically directed at an individual or individuals.” \n \nBut the packet “No More Hate: Hate Crimes 2010,” described below, explicitly states that \naggravated harassment in the first degree includes a provision that  \n \n“A person is guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree when…he… \netches, paints draws upon or otherwise places a swastika commonly exhibited as \nthe emblem of Nazi Germany on any building or other real property, public or \nprivate, owned by any person, firm or corporation or any public agency or \ninstrumentality, without express permission of the owner or operator, or whoever \npaints, draws upon or otherwise places or displays a “noose,” commonly \nexhibited as a symbol of racism and intimidation, on any building or other real \nproperty, public or private owned by any person, firm or corporation or any public \nagency…without express permission….”  \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nperpetrator of the offense selects his or her victim or commits the act or acts constituting the \noffense because of what the perpetrator believes is the victim’s race, color, national origin, \nancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation of a person. See \nN.Y. Penal Law § 485.05 (McKinney 2003) for a list of cognizable offenses that can be \nconsidered hate crimes.  The statute refers to these as “specified offenses.”  As the letter from \nMr. Seymour notes, “Making graffiti” does not appear on the list of specified offenses; “Criminal \nMischief in the 4th degree” does.    \n \n7 \n \n\n \nThe above description of the law does not require that there be evidence that the subject \n“specifically directed [the symbol] at an individual or individuals;” rather, according to this \ndescription of the law, the law presumes that one who paints a noose or swastika is, by that very \nact, directing the symbol to an individual or individuals.  SCPD should clarify these two \ndescriptions of the law so that they are presented in a way that is consistent—and correct—to \nofficers.  If officers are given conflicting or inaccurate statements of what the law requires \nregarding the painting of nooses and swastikas, the county and the state lose the ability to \naccurately track these forms of hate crimes.  \n \nAnother example of how the SPCD’s materials provide inadequate instructions to officers \nregarding the charging of hate crimes is that, although the packet “No More Hate”  describes \nseveral charges, including “aggravated harassment in the second degree” (prohibiting various \nforms of assault and battery against another that is motivated by race, color, national origin, \nancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation), “aggravated \nharassment in the first degree” (prohibiting damaging religious premises and painting swastikas \nand nooses,” and “aggravated disorderly conduct” (prohibiting disrupting a religious service), it \ndoes not list the full panoply of charges that officers can use when a crime is motivated by \nanimus towards one of the protected groups.  For example, in its 2004 letter, DCJS notes that \ncharging the perpetrator of a graffiti drawing that contains, for example, anti-Jewish slogans with \n“criminal mischief” would allow the charge to come under the definition of a hate crime.  (See \nNew York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, Memorandum to Detective/Sargent [sic] \nRobert Reecks, Suffolk County PD, June 14, 2004).  The packet “No More Hate” describes the \nlaw in general that prohibits graffiti, but inexplicably lacks a description of the charge that would \nallow the crime to be upgraded to a hate crime.   \n \nAdditionally, there is no mention in this packet or in any of the other documents provided \nby Suffolk County that attempts or conspiracies to commit hate crimes are also chargeable \noffenses.  Further, there is no instruction for officers on how to determine whether a suspect has \na hate-based motive.  These details are critical because pursuant to NY Penal Law § 485.05 \n(McKinney 2003) in order to charge a hate crime, there must be a specific motive—one that is \ndirected toward an individual based on one of the prohibited categories.  Accordingly, if officers \nare to correctly identify and charge hate crimes as hate crimes, they have to be able to accurately \ndetect such motives.   \n \nFinally, there is no mention in any of these materials that youths can be charged with hate \ncrimes.  Officers need to be informed clearly that youths are capable of committing hate crimes.  \nThe tendency to brush off attacks as “just kids being kids” fails to recognize the severity of \ncriminal conduct in which minors may engage, as seen from the murder of Marcelo Lucero, \nwhose attackers were high school-aged youths.  Greater detail and consistency are required \nthroughout these documents in order for officers to have the direction they need to correctly \ncharge hate crimes and prevent hate crimes from occurring.       \n \nWhile we understand the HCU is charged with investigating hate crimes, as well as \n“hateful incidents,” there does not seem to be a clear definition of what constitutes a hateful \nincident.  Bias driven behavior, even if it does not rise to the level of a hate crime, can be \nsignificant, and it should be addressed.  Unchecked, it can develop into serious hate crimes, as \nevidenced by the events preceding the death of Marcelo Lucero.  \n8 \n \n\n \n \n  To better anticipate and address bias incidents, SCPD should develop clearer definitions \nof what constitutes a “bias incident” or “hate incident.”  During our on-site visits, we saw \nmultiple references in documents, including arrest reports and incident reports, to bias incidents \nand hate incidents.  However, while examples of “hateful incidents” have been offered, such as \npainting a swastika on a stop sign, none of the SCPD officials we met with were able to provide \na clear definition of a hateful incident.  This lack of clarity may be the result of guidance \nmaterials that officers receive regarding hate incidents.  For instance, the packet “No More Hate: \nHate Crimes 2010” attempts to lay out the definition of a “hate incident” by contrasting it with \nthe definition of a hate crime.  The discussion begins with the following definition of a hate \ncrime:  \n \n1. “‘Criminal Offense’ means offenses that are criminal in nature, including \njuvenile offenses, disorderly persons offenses, misdemeanors, motor vehicle, \noffenses, felonies and crimes + ‘Bias motive’ means that the perpetrator and [sic] \na motive to commit the criminal offense because of the victim’s (actual or \nperceived) race, color, religion  [sic] Ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender [sic] \nN[sic]ational origin, or disability = If either element—criminal offense or bias \nmotive—is absent, then there is no hate crime.  A bias motive coupled with some \naction that does not constitute a criminal offense is often referred to as a  ‘Bias \nincident.’” \n \nThere is no further elaboration on what “some action” could be—but such elaboration is \ncritical.  As we mention above, incidents that might not rise to the level of a crime could \nnevertheless be predictors for future hate crimes; officers therefore need to have a clear \nunderstanding of the sort of hate incidents that they should take note of but this packet does not \nprovide such guidance.  Where applicable, specific examples of hate incidents should be \nprovided; while DOJ understands that SCPD cannot anticipate every possible scenario an officer \nwill encounter, several illustrative hypothetical or actual examples could at least provide some \nguidance to a topic that otherwise might be vague.  Taking these steps would help ensure that \nofficers take note of those incidents that might not rise to the level of a chargeable offense, but \nthat could serve as predictors for future crimes, and ensures that officers have the confidence of \nknowing that the county has defined these terms consistently.   \n \nC)  SCPD Should Develop Better Methods to Track Hate Crimes/Incidents and Follow Up \non Hate Crime/Incident Complaints  \n \n  In addition to providing clear definitions of “hate incidents” and “hate crimes,” SCPD \nshould develop a better system for tracking these types of incidents and crimes.  For example, in \n“SCPD Internal Correspondence” between February 5, 2008, and May 4, 2011, there are \nmonthly reports regarding the hate crimes cases reported from the same month the previous year, \nbroken down by race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, and “non bias.”  However, \nit does not appear from these reports that SCPD accurately tracks or trends this data.  Such \ntracking and trending will assist in observing patterns of behavior and areas which require further \nattention.   \n \n9 \n \n\n \nWe also suggest that SCPD also conduct a crime victim survey, which would enhance its \nability to identify and understand trends.  Such a survey could provide SCPD with a basis to \ncompare its internally generated data and assess the accuracy of its reporting mechanisms.  For \nexample, if the number of hate crimes reported has decreased from one year to the next, but a \ncrime survey illustrates an increase or stagnation in hate crimes, that could serve as evidence that \nthe HCU is unsuccessful in decreasing hate crimes and does not have sufficient reporting \nmechanisms in place.  If, however, the number of hate crimes reported has increased, and has \nkept pace with any increase in hate crimes that were reported in the victimization survey, that \nwould illustrate to the HCU that its reporting mechanism is working, even though it has not been \nsuccessful in decreasing hate crimes.  Finally, if the victimization survey showed a decrease in \nhate crimes that could illustrate that the HCU is succeeding in reducing hate crimes.  The \nNational Crime Victimization Survey distributed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics could serve \nas a model.  SCPD may be able to partner with local universities and non-profit organizations to \ndevelop a plan to distribute such surveys.4  \n \n  We also understand that SCPD police officers and investigators now receive a full day of \nHate Crimes training.  We recommend that SCPD ensure that all members of the department \nreceive this training and regular refresher training. Training in hate crimes and bias incidents will \nenhance SCPD patrol officers’ abilities to take citizen complaints in the normal course of \nbusiness and collect relevant information about hate crimes.  Reporting officers should be trained \nto elicit information about racial epithets or other hate crime indicia or other conduct which may \nbe offensive to an identifiable group.  This practice will demonstrate to the community a \ncontinued awareness and sensitivity to hate crime violations and improve the ability of SCPD to \nidentify and track them. \n \n  According to County Attorney Malafi’s May 11, 2011 letter, SCPD policy was changed \nto require reception and investigation of third party complaints.  SCPD should always allow \ncommunity members who may be reluctant to contact the police to make reports about \nharassment or crime through third party community organizations.  Community organizations \nmay be less intimidating than the police precincts.  By working with these organizations the \nDepartment will restore confidence in the Latino community in the investigative process and \nminimize community reticence to report crimes.  Community members should be advised of the \noption to report through a community group or the Department’s web page Greater involvement \nof patrol officers in the initial handling of hate crimes will also enhance SCPD’s ability to \naddress hate crimes and incidents.  We understand that, at present, it is the practice of patrol \nofficers and their supervisors to defer entirely to the HCU when a hate crime or bias incident \noccurs.  While clearly the HCU, should take the lead in these investigations, training patrol \npersonnel in this area will result in greater and more accurate identification of hate crimes and \nbias incidents.  \n \nSCPD also needs to improve its follow-up after receiving a complaint of a hate crime or \nincident.  We recommend that SCPD provide a status update, within a reasonably prompt \ntimeframe, to a person who has reported an incident of hate-related conduct to an officer (such a \nperson might be a witness, victim, or potential victim of the incident).  If SCPD contacts LEP \n                                                 \n4  See Bureau of Justice Statistics Crime Victimization Survey, available at \nhttp://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245 (last visited July 12, 2011).  \n10 \n \n\n \nindividuals, it must use appropriate language assistance services including competent bilingual \nstaff who speak the non-English language or telephonic interpreter services.  We recognize that \npolice officers are already obligated to provide updates to civilians who file complaints against \nofficers, but we believe that the follow-up should be extended to situations in which a person has \nreported a bias incident or any incident that does not rise to the level of a crime.  We also \nrecommend that SCPD memorialize these incidents and send them to an electronic database to \nhelp map and track possible crime hotspots.  Such affirmative actions convey the notion to the \ncommunity that police officers are actively seeking to address bias incidents and are keeping \nindividuals aware of what happened even when the incident may not rise to the level of a hate \ncrime. \n \nPublic confidence in the police department will increase and the public will assist the \nDepartment to ensure public safety once the public witnesses that hate crimes are being properly \ndocumented and investigated.  In the wake of past violent attacks against immigrants in Suffolk \nCounty, the SCPD should take proactive and deliberate steps to ensure that the HCU remains \ncommitted to investigating all hate crimes in an effective and independent manner. \n \nIII.    MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS  \n \nWe recommend that SCPD revise its procedures for receiving and investigating reports of \npolice misconduct, including modifying its report form to preserve the integrity of each \ninvestigation and to enhance complainant confidentiality.  SCPD should modify its current \nprocess for investigations of allegations of misconduct by officers to ensure that:  (1) all \nallegations are consistently investigated; (2) complainants remain engaged in the complaint \nprocess until resolution; (3) formal or official tracking numbers are established for each \nallegation, and (4) supervisors receive proper training in how to review and address the findings \nof internal misconduct investigations.  By addressing these issues SCPD will improve its \nreputation in the Latino community. \n \nA) Citizen Complaint Forms and Processes \n \n  An open, fair, and impartial process for receiving and investigating citizen complaints \nserves several important purposes.  An appropriate citizen complaint procedure ensures officer \naccountability and supervision, deters misconduct, and helps maintain good community \nrelations, increasing public confidence in and respect for law enforcement.  Improving SCPD’s \ncurrent procedures for handling citizen complaints would maximize these goals. \n \nUnder the SCPD’s current practices, complaints may be made at SCPD Headquarters or \nany of the precincts located throughout Suffolk County.  When a complaint is made, a copy of  \nthe printed online Civilian Complaint Report or the manually completed Form PDCS-1300 is \ngiven to the complainant.  This form includes the complainant’s name, address, and phone \nnumber, as well as details of the complaint.  If this form is lost by the complainant, or is viewed \nby the subject of the complaint, it may compromise investigation of a complaint.  We \nrecommend that SCPD develop a privacy-oriented tracking system that does not include personal \nidentifiers to protect the identity of the complainant, any witnesses and the officer.  This will \nfurther serve to preserve the integrity of the investigation. \n \n11 \n \n\n \nAccording to SCPD policy (Order Number 10-25), Compliment/Complaint Information \nReports (PDCS-1300-1) are to be “conspicuously displayed in each precinct lobby, Headquarters \nlobby, and at other appropriate public facilities, in such a manner that members of the public can \nobtain one without asking.”  See Paragraph V(A)(1)(a) of Chapter 5, Section 2.  We recommend \nthat blank complaint forms be available in publicly accessible locations such as libraries, post \noffices, and community recreation centers and that forms continue to be available without the \nneed for a specific request.  Accessibility to complaint forms makes it easier for a resident who \nmay be reluctant to go to a local precinct or other SCPD facility, because, for example, he or she \nhas already had a negative interaction with SCPD officers.  Civilian complaint forms and \ninformational materials should be also carried by all SCPD patrol officers and be available on the \nSCPD website.    \n \n  According to County Attorney Malafi’s May 11, 2011 letter, SCPD has developed a self-\nsubmit complaint form available in both English and Spanish.  The letter states that this form is \navailable, without asking, in all precincts as well as at police headquarters, the Suffolk County \nHuman Rights Commission, and at public libraries.  We recommend that the form be available in \nadditional locations and that it be made available in English, Spanish and any other commonly \nused language in Suffolk County.  We also recommend that complaint forms be available online, \nboth for completion and for electronic submission.  As discussed above, as recipients of federal \nfinancial assistance, and given the growing Spanish-speaking population in Suffolk County, \nSCPD must ensure that it has language assistance services in place and that it provides them at \nno cost to LEP individuals.5  This means that complaint forms and other vital information must \nbe translated into Spanish and other non-English languages and competent bilingual officers and \nother interpreter services must be provided to assist LEP complainants in filling out the \nnecessary form.  Our formal discussion regarding Suffolk County’s provision of LEP assistance \nwill be in our Findings Letter.   \n \n  SCPD Order Number 10-25 states that the civilian complaint procedure is intended to \nensure that all department members will refer complaints regarding official misconduct to their \nrespective officers in charge.  The policy should define “official misconduct” to include criminal \nand serious administrative misconduct that could result in dismissal.  SCPD should also consider \nusing the word “allegation” throughout the text of Order 10-25 instead of “complaint” and \nshould define “allegation” in Section III.  SCPD should consider incorporating a definition \nsimilar to the following: \n \n                                                 \n5   Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq., VI requires recipients \nof federal financial assistance to provide meaningful access to LEP individuals by providing \ntranslated vital documents like complaint forms.  We have three memoranda of agreement \nbetween the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies as a result of Title VI \ninvestigations to provide examples of policies and procedures that should be in place to ensure \nSCPD is complying with the requirements of Title VI and its implementing regulations.  We also \nattached a copy of the U.S. Department of Justice Language Access Assessment and Planning \nTool for Federally Conducted and Federally Assisted Programs, which is available at \nhttp://www.lep.gov/resources/2011_Language_Access_Assessment_and_Planning_Tool.pdf. \n(last visited  July 12, 2011). \n12 \n \n\n \nAn allegation is the reporting of any employee misconduct classified as: (1) \nCriminal – an act or omission of a duty that, if substantiated, would result in a \ncriminal conviction; or (2) Administrative – an act that, if substantiated, could \nresult in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.  Allegations do not \ninclude routine supervisory matters or other performance issues (e.g., losing \ncredentials, failure to engage video camera). \n \n  The definition of allegation should include actions or performance and non-performance \nthat violate policy, rules and regulations, procedures, criminal or civil law, written directives, \noperational instructions, interoffice communications, personnel orders, and training regulations.  \nIt should also include the requirement of all officers to report such conduct.  Using the term \n“allegation” is preferable to “complaint” because “complaint” implies more formality, an \nelement of proof, and usually suggests the complainant identifies himself.  Conversely, \nallegations imply less of a requirement for substantial knowledge; they are merely a transfer of \ninformation to an authority to investigate.     \n \n  Although we commend you for signing an executive order in 2010 which provides for the \nHuman Rights Commission to accept and process complaints against SCPD that allege undue \nforce or discriminatory conduct,6 the HRC’s efficacy seems limited.  According to interviews we \nconducted, when the HRC receives complaints against the police, it does not independently \ninvestigate them.  Instead, it refers them to IAB or other internal police investigatory units.    \nThis is not an effective method of ensuring independent monitoring of police conduct, and it \ngives the public a false impression.  \n \nB) Intake and Tracking of Complaints Against Law Enforcement \n \n1)  Intake of Complaint  \n \n  SCPD should accept all complaints or allegations of police misconduct, including \nanonymous or third party complaints that, if true, would constitute a violation of applicable laws \nor SCPD’s rules and regulations.  The form of the complaint or allegation should not be an \nimpediment to its receipt, tracking, and processing; allegations should be accepted by individuals \nmaking them in person or by telephone, complaint form, personal letter, website, email, fax, or \nTDD.  SCPD policy should make clear that all allegations, regardless of the source, will be \nreviewed and a determination made as to the nature and extent of the investigation required.  \nSCPD policy should make clear that complaints and allegations do not have to be submitted in \nwriting.  Thus, SCPD Order Number 10-25 Paragraph VI.B(1-3), regarding third-party \ncomplaints, could be eliminated and replaced with language indicating that all complaints will be \naccepted and subjected to review by IAB, which will determine if an investigation is warranted \nand the nature and extent of the investigation to be conducted.  If an incident is determined to be \na performance issue, it can be returned to the precinct through the chain-of-command for \ndisposition, with a copy of the final resolution to IAB.  SCPD policy may also choose to \nincorporate language indicating that it will seek a criminal prosecution against any person who \nintentionally files a false complaint.   IAB should be responsible for classifying, processing, and \n                                                 \n6   The Suffolk County Human Rights Commission 2010 Annual Report. \n13 \n \n\n \ndisseminating all complaints against SCPD members.  In addition, even if the complainant \nwishes to withdraw the complaint, the investigation should continue to resolution. \n \n  SCPD Order Number 10-25, titled “Civilian Complaint Procedure,” effective August 2, \n2010, requires that when a member of the public prepares a complaint via the \nCompliment/Complaint Information Report, that report “can” be forwarded directly to the \nInternal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”) by the command accepting the report.  We recommend that \nSCPD send all potential complaints and allegation, not just Compliment/Complaint Reports, to \nIAB.   Further, we recommend the policy be rewritten to read that such complaints “must” be \nforwarded to IAB within the next 48 hours.   \n \nAll IAB complaints should be maintained on a strictly need-to-know basis and access to \nsuch complaints should be restricted to IAB personnel whenever possible.  Order Number 10-25 \nstates that supervisors must, when possible, record complaints where a person is physically \nlocated.  See Paragraph V(C) of Chapter 5, Section 2.  We recommend instead that all potential \ncomplaints against SCPD officials be transferred or referred directly to IAB, via telephone or in \nperson.  For example, when an individual calls a local precinct, rather than the central SCPD \nswitchboard, the Precinct Duty Officer should connect the caller directly to IAB and then drop \nthe line, to preserve the integrity of the allegation and protect the caller from inadvertent or \nimproper disclosure.  Complaints against other agencies could be taken by the Duty Officer and \nalso referred to IAB.  .  \n \nIn addition, all SCPD members have the responsibility to report allegations as soon as \nthey become aware of them, including self-reporting.  SCPD policy should provide a penalty for \nthe failure to report allegations as well as a penalty against those who retaliate against members \nwho initiate such reports.  IAB also should have protocols in place to ensure that it receives a \ndirect report if any member of the department suspects that an officer any may have engaged in \ncertain types of conduct such as bribery, drug use, excessive force resulting in egregious bodily \ninjury, and other allegations of a serious or sensitive nature. Further, IAB should ensure that \nprotocols exist so that it is notified of  the disposition of all prosecutions of SCPD officers in \ncases involving charges of obstruction of official business, resisting arrest, officer assault, or \ndisorderly conduct.  Similarly, IAB should be notified by the Suffolk County District Attorney’s \noffice or local courts when SCPD officers are accused or have been found guilty of having \nintentionally violated individuals’ constitutional rights.   \n \n2)  Tracking Complaints \n \nSCPD Order Number 10-257 states that a copy of the online complaint report or PDCS-\n1300 should be given to the complainant.  However, this document could be misplaced or shown \nto someone without a need to know, thus exposing to third parties the identities of potential \nwitnesses, police officers, etc.  Instead, to ensure the proper and timely resolution of civilian \ncomplaints, we recommend that SCPD assign complaints a complaint number to be used to track \nthe investigation.  Copies of the complaint should be made available upon request and every \n                                                 \n7   In addition to the recommendations regarding SCPD Order Number 10-25 we make in \nthe main text of this letter, we also attach a red lined version of the Order with additional \nrecommendations. \n14 \n \n\n \ncomplainant should be made aware of this opportunity.  Complainants may use the complaint \nnumber to follow up on the status of the investigation.  All complainants should also receive a \nletter acknowledging receipt of the complaint and thanking them for providing the information.  \nWhen the complaint is written in a non-English language, SCPD should promptly translate the \ncontents of the complaint and send an acknowledgement written in that non-English language.  A \ncopy of this letter should be maintained in the investigative folder.  At the conclusion of an \ninvestigation, SCPD should notify all relevant parties, including complainants, of the final \ndisposition.  If one or several of the relevant parties are LEP, this notification should be provided \nin the appropriate non-English language(s).  Through our early document review, we have found \nvariance in the quality of notification letters to complainants.  We suggest a standardized letter \nthat allows for providing important information to the complainant such as the IAB reference \nnumber.  In this way, citizens can, if they choose, contact IAB and easily reference their \ncomplaints. \n \nC)  Citizen Complaints of Criminal or Illegal Conduct \n \nWe encourage SCPD to adopt a policy that explicitly prohibits officers from engaging in \nconduct that tends to discourage a citizen from making a complaint regarding criminal or illegal \nconduct.  During our tour, we heard complaints that some officers have declined to take formal \ncomplaints if the alleged perpetrator is a juvenile or where the officer perceives the alleged \noffense as not serious.  Some individuals also claimed that officers declined to assist them where \nlanguage was a barrier to communication.  The intake process should facilitate the public’s \nability to make complaints and reduce the perception that SCPD discourages complaints.  \nFurther, any new policy or procedure should provide that if an officer violates the policy he or \nshe may be subject to discipline.   \n \nD)  Early Warning System \n \nWe recommend that SCPD use its current computer database early warning system, \nIAPRO, to track data on use of force, citizen complaints, internal investigations, service calls, \ndiscipline, and other items relevant to each officer’s conduct.  SCPD should use this data \nregularly and proactively to: (1) promote best professional police practices; (2) improve \naccountability and management; (3) manage the risk of police misconduct and potential liability; \n(4) evaluate and audit the performance of officers and units; (5) evaluate and assess the \neffectiveness of training and policy; and (6) recognize and commend positive officer \nperformance.   \n \n  In keeping with best practices, we recommend that, to the extent that it does not already, \nSCPD use IAPRO as follows:   \n \n1.  The early warning system should capture information on all investigations and complaints, \nincluding non-sustained complaints and complaints prior to final disposition, discipline and \nother supervisory corrective measures, uses of force, arrests and charges, searches and \nseizures, service calls, training, awards and commendations, sick leave, civil lawsuits, and \nother items relevant to an officer’s conduct.    \n \n15 \n \n\n \n2.  SCPD should use IAPRO to gather and track data for each officer’s arrests by race or \nethnicity of the subject.   \n \n3.  We also recommend that SCPD require supervisors, including command staff, to review \nthese data for every officer they supervise on a quarterly basis. \n \n4.  We recommend that SCPD compare their subordinates’ IAPRO data to that of the \nsubordinates’ peers, focusing upon complaints against officers and use-of-force reports.  \n \n5.  Command staff should review the unit-wide IAPRO data and compare these data with peer \nunits.  In addition, a policy should be established providing explicit guidance to supervisory \nofficers reviewing reports to ensure that patterns of possible misconduct are identified, \nanalyzed, and addressed properly by command staff.  The aim of this process is to give \nsupervisors valuable information that, if received early, could identify potential problem \nofficers before misconduct occurs.  \n \n6.  To use IAPRO effectively as a predictive model tool, SCPD must ensure that the system has \ndefined triggers for management intervention.  SCPD should revise as appropriate its IAPRO \npolicy to establish guidelines regarding what specific events will trigger an additional \nsupervisory review, what type of a review will be conducted, and what type of remedial \nservices or action is needed, if any.   \n \nE)  Timeline and Protocols for Misconduct Investigations \n \nSCPD General Order 10-01 states that IAB’s standard for completing investigations is 90 \ndays.  We recommend that SCPD adopt a policy that, absent exigent circumstances, all \ninvestigations of officer misconduct be completed within 45 calendar days.  The investigation \nshould include a review by the Commissioner or his command staff designee.   Internal \nadjudication, if any, of the results of the investigation should be timely completed within \ndeadlines specified under SCPD’s labor agreements.  Imposition of any discipline should occur \nwithin 30 days of the end of the Commissioner’s review or the end of internal adjudication.  \nExtensions beyond these time periods should require the Commissioner’s written approval \n(rather than the deputy chief’s approval), based upon criteria set out in SCPD policy, and be \ncommunicated in writing to the complainant.  Misconduct investigations should be completed \nwithin 45 days from receipt of the allegation to disposition, unless extenuating circumstances \nwarrant keeping the investigation open beyond that period.  Exigent circumstances include those \ninvolving witnesses who are unavailable and criminal cases that are pending. \n \n1)  General Order Number 11, Section 3 \n \nGeneral Order Number 11, Section 3 requires that all pre-civil suit administrative notices \nof claim seeking monetary damages for police conduct routinely be forwarded to IAB for \nappropriate investigation.  We agree that this is an appropriate notification.  This order should \nemphasize that it is every officer’s responsibility to immediately notify his or her supervisor if he \nor she is named as a party in a civil suit for on-duty conduct and for off-duty conduct alleging \nracial bias or physical violence.   \n \n16 \n \n\n \nF)  Complaint Quality Assurance \n \nWe recommend that SCPD’s IAB conduct periodic random follow-up surveys to assess \ncompleted misconduct investigations.  IAB should contact complainants to ensure that the \ninvestigation was handled professionally and thoroughly.  Specific questions about the conduct \nof the investigation should be asked:  whether the complainant understood the investigative \nprocess; whether the complainant felt that the investigator was thorough in his or her \nquestioning; and whether the complainant received both written acknowledgement of the \ncomplaint and notification of the results of the investigation.  A dedicated auditing component of \nSCPD should examine the receipt, investigation, and adjudication of all misconduct \ninvestigations. \n \nFurther, when possible, interviews of victims, complainants, witnesses and subjects \nconducted during misconduct investigations should be tape recorded.  There should be \nrandomized periodic audits by supervisors of the taped interviews to ensure that IAB \ninvestigators asked probative questions. \n \n  We also recommend that IAB perform an annual check of officers’ New York State \ndriving records for violations or suspended licenses and check local court dockets for civil suits \nthat may have bearing on an officer’s behavior on duty.  IAB should act proactively and use both \nintegrity tests and record reviews to identify potential internal affairs issues.  Lastly, if, during \nthe course of an IAB investigation, collateral misconduct is discovered, IAB should institute an \ninvestigation of the misconduct.  IAB policy should be clear that if a policy violation is \nuncovered during such an investigation, IAB will identify the violation and investigate or refer it \nas appropriate.  Likewise, the policy should state that any criminal conduct uncovered will also \nlead to a referral for a criminal investigation. \n \nIV.  SUPERVISION AND ACCOUNTABILITY \n \nA) The Internal Affairs Bureau:  Structure and Organization \n \nThe internal affairs component of a law enforcement agency should seek to maintain the \nintegrity of the department through a system of internal discipline or corrective action after it \nconducts objective and impartial investigations.  SCPD should continue to support the core \nmission of IAB: to monitor the behavior of police officers for misconduct while maintaining its \nobjectivity and autonomy. \n \nSCPD should consider altering the chain-of-command for the IAB.  Similar entities in \nother departments and most other departments within SCPD report directly to Chiefs or \nCommissioners.  IAB currently reports to a Deputy Commissioner.  \n \nB)  Incentivizing positions at IAB \n \nSCPD should consider creating incentives for officers to take positions in IAB.  This will \nallow the Department to select the best officer(s) for the position and make the position a more \nattractive career path.  SCPD should promote the work done by IAB investigators and reach out \nto ensure diversity and excellence.  We recommend that IAB positions start at the rank of \n17 \n \n\n \ndetective.  The head commander of IAB should have first choice of applicants for detective \npositions.  Special consideration should be given to individuals who can demonstrate \ncompetency in Spanish and other frequently encountered non-English languages and/or officers \nwho can commit to taking language instruction and interpreter training courses to attain \ncompetency.  Service in IAB should be a minimum of three years during which time applicants \ncould avail themselves of advanced training in investigative techniques.  Upon completion of the \nassignment, IAB members should be given extra preference in their next assignment.  Officers \nwould be permitted to remain in IAB longer if they desired.   \n \nC)  Toll free Bilingual Civilian Complaint Hotline  \n According to County Attorney Malafi’s May 11, 2011 letter, SCPD has established a \ntoll-free hotline.  SCPD should ensure that a toll-free 24-hour Civilian Complaint Hotline is \navailable in English, Spanish, and other languages prevalent in Suffolk County to accept \ncomplaints of misconduct and positive comments about officer conduct.  The toll free Hotline \nshould be recorded and should be periodically audited to ensure that:  the calls are being taped; \nthe intake officer provided his or her name, rank, and affiliation; the intake officer arranged for \nan interpreter, if needed; the intake officer did not attempt to discourage the caller from making \nthe complaint; and the intake officer made it clear that the complaint did not have to be in \nwriting.  The toll free hotline number should be listed on informational material, complaint \nforms, and consent to search forms.  All forms should be printed in English, Spanish, and other \nnon-English languages depending on the linguistic composition of the services area.  There \nshould be sufficient advertising to inform the community of the Hotline number and encouraging \ncommunity members to report all incidents.   \n \nD)  Random Integrity Tests \n \nWe recommend that SCPD consider randomized integrity tests of the complaint reporting \nsystem.  Testers should call precincts or approach officers in the street indicating they wish to \nfile a complaint of misconduct.  IAB can then ensure that the receiving officer provided the \ncomplainant with the proper reporting procedure and that the officer reported the information as \nrequired by standard operating procedures (SOPs).  The SOPs must specifically note that if, \nduring the course of an IAB investigation, a complainant wishes not to proceed further, or wishes \nto withdraw the complaint, that the complainant understands the investigation will go to \nconclusion regardless of whether the complainant cooperates.   \n \nSCPD should be proactive in offering assistance to officers who have reported \nmisconduct or other acts of prohibited discrimination to ensure that their careers do not suffer \nadverse consequences for their cooperative actions. \n \nV.    TRAINING  \n \nDuring our site visit, we found that SCPD needs to provide its officers additional training \nbeyond the basic training they receive when they first join the department.  We recognize that \nSCPD has upgraded its ongoing training programs and will continue to develop new programs \n18 \n \n\n \nfor officers and supervisors.8  Adequate training is a critical element in the creation and \nsustainment of effective and appropriate policing.  For training to be successful, the department \nshould set priorities and evaluate the success of training.  The recommendations below outline a \nstrategy for SCPD to adopt best policing practices. \n \nPolicies and procedures are the primary means by which police departments \ncommunicate their standards and expectations to their officers.  Accordingly, it is essential that \nSCPD’s policies be comprehensive, up-to-date, comprehensible, and consistent with relevant \nlegal standards and contemporary police practices.9  Several of SCPD’s policies and procedures \nare inconsistent with generally accepted police practices and are insufficiently detailed to provide \nthe appropriate guidance for officer conduct. \n \nSCPD should improve the means by which police personnel are informed of new \npolicies.  Currently, SCPD primarily uses roll-calls to inform officers of policy changes.  From \nour review of this practice, by itself, it is not the most effective way to ensure that personnel are \nfully informed of the new policies.  Accordingly, we recommend that SCPD distribute written \ncopies of all new policies to each officer.  For policies discussing major changes, including the \nprocedure to inquire about immigration status, the handling of citizen complaints, or the process \nfor complaint reporting, all incoming and current SCPD officers should receive a substantive \ntraining session.  Upon completing this training, each officer should provide a written \nacknowledgment of their receipt, review, and understanding of the policy.  This written \nacknowledgment should be maintained as part of SCPD officer’s personnel file.   \n \nIn addition, we suggest that SCPD designate an individual who will be responsible for \nreviewing any revisions to new policies and, where necessary, promptly notifying command staff \nregarding changes in substantive law and ensuring that SCPD policies are consistent (e.g., the \ncitizen complaint process should treat immigration status in a manner consistent with other \npolicies of the department).10  This official would also be responsible for ensuring that all \nofficers receive complete copies of policy manuals and policy revisions, and for maintaining \ncopies of officers’ signed acknowledgments.  We also recommend that when SCPD revises \npolicies or procedures it provides officers copies that highlight in some fashion11 the changes \nthat have been made.  This will assist officers, who already have busy schedules, to quickly and \n                                                 \n8   We recommend that SCPD make its training materials available to all officers and \nsupervisors through the Internet.   \n9   We understand that SCPD has been revising its policies and practices based on the \ntechnical assistance we provided during our tours.  This letter reflects our recommendations \nbased on the policies and practices we received prior to, during and following our tour.  We have \nendeavored to review the most recent version of the policies and procedures discussed in this \nletter.  Please note that Suffolk County should not interpret our discussion of certain policies and \nprocedures as an approval of all or any other SCPD policies or procedures not reviewed. \n10   Any substantive legal updates or changes should be made in consultation with the County \nAttorney or her designee. \n11   For example, a “redline” copy of a document created in Microsoft Word displays new \nlanguage with an underscore and language that was deleted with a strikethrough.  The \nDepartment does not endorse any one particular word processing program over another and only \nuses Microsoft Word as an example. \n19 \n \n\n \naccurately see what provisions have been changed, added, or deleted.  First-line supervisors \nshould conduct periodic assessments of officers’ policy manuals to ensure that those manuals are \nup-to-date and complete.   \n \nWe recommend that SCPD post policies, procedures and general orders of public \nimportance (e.g. those regarding citizen complaints, hate crimes, use of force) on the official \nSCPD website, rather than distributing them to members of the department only in paper form.  \nAn electronic version should be searchable (manual-wide, not just within each policy) and \ninclude both a comprehensive index and a table of contents.  This will make them more \naccessible to SCPD personnel.  Additionally, having the SCPD policy and procedure manual \nonline will make this vital information available to the community.   \n \nSCPD can identify training needs by seeking recommendations from internal SCPD \ncommittees, IAB, focus groups, or from command staff.  Externally, the need to train or re-train \nofficers can be generated by changes in the law, court interpretations of police procedures, world \nevents, and best practices as defined by similarly situated police agencies or police organizations.  \n \nGeneral Order 18, Section 2.C.2 (Training) discusses the procedures of the training \ncommittee.  That subsection requires members to conduct research, review reports and field \nobservations, and make recommendations or modifications in training, with the understanding \nthat the Police Training Academy Bureau can adopt final modifications.  SCPD should revise \nthis policy to include clear requirements.  At a minimum, it should mandate:  (a) assessment of \ntraining needs; (b) development, delivery, and evaluation of training; (c) evaluating the field \nimplementation of the training; (d) creating a document archival system for all training provided \nand (e) a training record for each officer to track in-service training.   \n \nBy creating these specific outcome measures, SCPD will be better able to measure \nwhether training has been successful.  SCPD must ensure an evaluative component both in the \ntraining and its implementation.  The content of the instruction, the instructors, and the delivery \nshould be evaluated by students.  Similarly, training without successful field implementation \nmay be inadequate.  Feedback from officers, IAB, and commanders can determine if SCPD’s \never-changing needs are met.  \n \nVI.  COMMUNITY OUTREACH \n \n   Effective policies and practices regarding community relations enhance and reinforce \npolice/community relationships and play a significant role in ensuring that a police department \nmaintains the trust of its residents.  Trust begins, but does not end, with responding to residents’ \nneeds.  Effective policing requires that police departments provide other services, such as \ncommunity policing.  The benefits of outreach programs include greater willingness by residents \nto cooperate with police investigations, increased reporting of issues within the community, \nincreased community trust in the police department, and enhanced public safety.  We encourage \nSCPD to enhance its community relations and outreach programs, particularly to cultivate \nrelationships with Latino communities in Suffolk County.  SCPD has increased its initiatives, but \nthey are nevertheless still limited. \n  \n \n20 \n \n\n \nA)  SCPD Should Enhance the COPE Program \n   \n  One of the most important techniques to cultivate better community relations is \ncommunity policing.12  SCPD’s community oriented policing program is called Community \nOriented Police Enforcement (“COPE”).  SCPD officials have stated that COPE officers \nproactively address problems and issues before they become the subject of traditional policing \n(e.g. criminal apprehension), and that COPE officers are assigned to specific beats to develop \nrelationships with residents and business owners in the area and for community members to \ninteract with SCPD outside of emergent circumstances such as arrests.   \n \n  Although there are a substantial number of COPE officers in SCPD, our investigation \nrevealed that COPE officers do not, with only a few exceptions, engage in genuine community \npolicing.  COPE officers function in traditional patrol units, interacting with community \nmembers largely only in response to calls, complaints, and arrests.  In discussing the day-to-day \noperations of COPE officers with SCPD staff, we were routinely informed that COPE is viewed \nby officers primarily as a promotional stepping stone to becoming a detective, and that \ncommunity outreach is not the primary thrust of the program. \n \n  There were notable exceptions to this general rule.  A small group of COPE officers we \nencountered had worked to become familiar with the community they patrolled.  They regularly \ninteracted with shop owners, and one of these officers made regular visits to schools in the area \nto speak to students and develop relationships with school officials.  This conduct is laudable and \nshould be the norm for COPE officers, rather than the exception. \n \nThe COPE program can be enhanced by collecting data from field reports and memo \nbooks maintained by officers.  We understand that field reports and notes made in officers’ \nmemo books are not entered into a database or recorded in any organized fashion.  These records \ncan help track trends in conduct which, while not rising to the level of an arrestable offense, \ncould identify patterns of behavior which if unaddressed could escalate to criminal activity.  \nTherefore, we recommend that officers memorialize all such incidents (i.e. those incidents that \ndo not rise to the level of an arrestable offense), and then require that the reports of these \nincidents be sent to a centralized database that is capable of processing and possibly mapping \ntrends.  In this way, SCPD can pursue additional surveillance and other preemptive crime-control \nmeasures in areas that may be likely to experience a hate crime.  We are pleased that the SCPD \nhas established a position of Community Liaison Officer within each precinct’s COPE unit.  \nAccordingly, we suggest that Section 1 of Chapter 28 of the policy manual be expanded to \ninclude reference to this new position in the COPE unit and the unit’s re-invigorated mission.  \nWith effective deployment, community liaison officers will link the community with the various \nprecincts.  Over time, Latino residents may consider SCPD officers as more approachable, \nthereby bridging the distrust that currently exists. \n                                                 \n12    Community policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies, which \nsupport the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively \naddress the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social \ndisorder, and fear of crime.  See www.cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=36 (Last visited May 9, \n2011). \n \n21 \n \n\n \n \nB)  SCPD Should Expand Its Community Outreach and Liaison Programs   \n  In addition to an effective COPE program, a well-developed community outreach \nprogram is essential to better community relations.  Though there are few efforts made to reach \nout to the Latino community, a notable exception is the laudable work of the Special Advisor to \nthe Commissioner for Minority Affairs.  She is assigned as a full-time community relations \nofficer to the Latino community.  The officer is well-regarded and trusted in the Latino \ncommunity.  Her presence at community meetings and the direct assistance that she has offered \nto individuals has had an invaluable impact on the perception of the department within the Latino \ncommunities.  She is but one individual, however.  Community residents told us that SCPD’s \nassignment of only one person to be a liaison with the Latino community highlighted the lack of \neffort by SCPD rather than remedied the perception that SCPD is uninvolved in the Latino \ncommunity.  We recommend that the outreach program be expanded and that additional Spanish \nspeaking outreach officers be assigned to work as special advisors with the Latino communities.  \nAlthough County Attorney Malafi’s May 11, 2011 letter states that SCPD has appointed police \nofficials of Latino descent to key positions within the police department, such appointments, \nwhile symbolic, do not necessarily improves the department’s relationship with the Latino \ncommunity because these officials may not interact with individuals within the Latino \ncommunity on a regular basis. \n \n  Since December 2008, SCPD appears to have worked towards creating a better \nrelationship with the Latino community.  County Attorney Malafi’s May 11, 2011 letter \nmentioned outreach efforts such as the PoliceSmart Educational Program and ESL classes.  We \nencourage SCPD to continue to consider other cultural and language programs or activities.  \nOutreach methods include providing information to the public and to LEP communities \nregarding the language assistance services available free of charge, or including this information \non signage, websites, translated documents, telephone tree options, kiosks, and non-English or \nethnic media.13  Additionally, we encourage SCPD to increase the number of “outreach” \nactivities that occur outside of the precinct.  Requiring community members to visit the precincts \nmay deter some individuals from participating in such activities.  SCPD also has pointed to its \nPolice Athletic League (PAL) as a significant example of its community outreach.  However, \nthat program has not made an effort to recruit officers from the Latino community, and the level \nof participation by Latino youth is unclear.  While Police Athletic League programs have value, \nthey are not a substitute for community relations and outreach programs.  The department should \nensure that Latinos have full access to the PAL program, including providing forms in both \nEnglish and Spanish, and should ensure that bilingual officers who speak Spanish are involved in \nthe program.   \n \nSCPD should also continue working with community advocates to develop Spanish \nlanguage training and training on cultural norms in various Latino communities.  These programs \nshould be designed so that they are useful to officers when they interact with residents.  \nAdditionally, as mentioned in County Attorney Malafi’s May 22, 2011 letter, SCPD is providing \n                                                 \n13   See U.S. Department of Justice, Language Access Assessment and Planning Tool for \nFederally Conducted and Federally Assisted Programs, at 6.  \nhttp://www.lep.gov/resources/2011_Language_Access_Assessment_and_Planning_Tool.pdf.  \n22 \n \n\n \nsome Spanish language learning opportunities for officers as well as sensitivity and diversity \ntraining, including seminars administered by organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League.  \nSCPD should expand such opportunities.  When working with community based organizations, \nSCPD should provide information, translated into appropriate non-English languages, describing \nhow it provides language assistance services at no cost for LEP individuals.  SCPD will derive \ntwo mutually-reinforcing benefits from establishing such programs:  First, SCPD engages and \ncooperates with community advocates who will then convey the message to the community that \nSCPD is actively seeking to employ the most effective ways to communicate with and protect \nLatino residents.  Second, SCPD benefits through receiving language and cultural assistance, \nwhich in turn will help SCPD fight crime and protect residents more effectively.  \n \nDuring our interviews, community members and advocacy groups told us that they did \nnot know of or understand many SCPD policies and expressed a desire to be able to obtain \naccess through means other than filing a freedom of information request.  Though the SCPD \nwebsite currently provides access to some policies, the department should include updates of all \npolicies and procedures and post some form of notice on the website that a change, revision or \naddition has been made.  Because SCPD receives federal financial assistance, Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) also requires SCPD to translate any vital14written documents \nand ensure that limited English proficient (LEP) individuals in the community have meaningful \naccess to important written information.15  While SCPD’s website is available in Spanish, it \nseems that some online documents are translated using Google Translate, which is of limited \nvalue and accuracy.  An expert speaker of that language should review all translations for \naccuracy.  Further, when DOJ visited the SCPD website in late May 2011, the policy and \nprocedure translations in Spanish had formatting issues.  To be clear, “meaningful access” \nshould be interpreted to mean that LEP individuals should be provided versions of the same \ndocuments that are as legible and easy to decipher as those provided for English speaking \nindividuals.  \n \nWe believe greater access to the community and appropriate translations of SCPD \npolicies and procedures will assist in removing the appearance that SCPD’s actions are unclear \nor being concealed.  We understand that SCPD is in the process of publishing more information \non its website, and we commend that effort.   \n \n  SCPD’s dissemination of General Order 09-54 is a good, concrete example of how \naccessible policies assist SCPD in its community relations and outreach efforts.  General Order \n                                                 \n14  Whether or not a document is considered “vital” depends upon:  “the importance of the \nprogram, information, encounter, or service involved, and the consequence to the LEP person if \nthe information in question is not provided accurately or in a timely manner.”  67 Fed. Reg. \n41,455, 41,463 (June 18, 2002).   Examples of such written materials could include:  “Consent \nand complaint forms; intake forms with the potential for important consequences; written notices \nof rights, denial, loss, or decreases in benefits or services, parole, and other hearings; notices \nadvising LEP persons of free language assistance; prison rule books; written tests that do not \nassess English language competency, but test competency for a particular license, job, or skill for \nwhich knowing English is not required; and applications to participate in a recipient’s program or \nactivity or to receive recipient benefits or services.”  Id. at 41463 \n15   See 28 C.F.R.§ 42.405(d). \n23 \n \n\n \n09-54 provides that SCPD officers shall not ask victims of crime about their immigration status.  \nSCPD maintains that this has been its policy since 2005.  However, it was not until October 15, \n2009, almost one year following the death of Marcelo Lucero,16 that this policy was \ndisseminated to the public.  It also appears that even in 2005, the policy was not formally placed \ninto SCPD’s policies and procedures manual.  Thus, the Latino community in Suffolk County \nunderstandably perceived that this policy was issued only after, and in response to, the Lucero \nkilling and that SCPD had been authorized to request victims’ immigration status previously.  It \nis possible that had General Order 09-54 been available to the public when first issued, this \nperception could have been substantially mitigated and would have encouraged greater reporting \nof hate crimes. \n \nC)  SCPD Should Enhance Its Community Contacts to Address Gang Activity \n \n  Data suggests that gang activity is a serious problem in Suffolk County and that it \nparticularly adversely affects the Latino community.  SCPD is engaged in vigorous efforts to \nreduce and eliminate this serious concern.  However, to be most effective, gang prevention units \nshould have substantial community contacts to develop sources of information and, where \npossible, learn of potential gang activity before it occurs.  It is our understanding that SCPD has \neliminated local precinct gang units and replaced them with a department-wide Gang Team \nSection.  Having a centralized gang unit can severely limit SCPD’s ability to develop \nrelationships with the community or to create preventative interventions.  The lack of a regular \nanti-gang presence in the community alienates adults when gang prevention activity is conducted \nand exposes children, who are the primary targets of gang recruitment efforts, to gang influences.  \nWe recommend that SCPD focus its anti-gang activities on the local level, using re-established \nlocal precinct anti-gang units and street crime sections.  These units will be perceived by the \nLatino community as more interested in serving the community and addressing real community \nconcerns.  In addition, the community policing discussed above may assist in the anti-gang \ninitiatives of the SCPD. \n \nD)  SCPD Should Revise the Use of Roadblocks in Latino Communities \n \n  We understand that SCPD has used a vigorous program of roadblocks and police sobriety \ncheckpoints.  As law enforcement tools, these are established methods of addressing drunk \ndriving and other potential criminal activity.  We have received reports, however, that SCPD’s \ncheckpoints have been used primarily to request documentation of citizenship.  While we \n                                                 \n16   In November 2008, Mr. Lucero, an Ecuadorean man living in Patchogue, was fatally \nstabbed by a group of teenagers.  The same teenagers later admitted that, in the weeks before the \nLucero killing, they had regularly sought out and attacked Latino men in the community.  \nFollowing Mr. Lucero’s death numerous Latino men came forward and described incidents of \nharassment and/or attacks and their belief that they were attacked because of their heritage.  The \nattacks described were reported to have occurred over a period of years.  SCPD and the County \ngovernment stated that they were unaware that Latino men were targeted due to their ethnicity or \nnational origin.  Some Latinos who came forward in the aftermath of the Lucero killing \nexplained they had not reported hate crime incidents to SCPD because they had been previously \ndiscouraged by SCPD from reporting crimes, were afraid that they would be asked about their \nimmigration status, or because prior complaints of harassment went unheard.  \n24 \n \n\n \ncontinue to investigate these claims, if true, this is not an acceptable practice.  We recommend \nthat SCPD ensure that officers at checkpoints inspect only for sobriety or other specific illegal \nconduct and do not conduct identity checks or otherwise ask for documentation without a basis \nfor believing that a crime or violation has been committed.  \n \nE)  SCPD Should Develop Additional Mechanisms to Promote Cultural Competence In Its \nPolice Training, Policies and Procedures  \n \n  Vital for good community relations are policies and procedures that are culturally aware \nand take into consideration the cultural differences between different ethnic groups.  Officers \nwho are trained and guided by policies and procedures that recognize the cultural differences in \nthe various communities will be more effective in serving all communities. \n \n  One of the policies that SCPD should revise is Chapter 10, Section 1 of the Department \nManual, which states that a police officer should: \n \nGive particular attention to peddlers and solicitors to determine that they are \nproperly licensed and are not using that occupation as a cloak for some illegal \npurpose. \n \nStreet vendors are common in many immigrant communities, including immigrant communities \nwith high Latino populations.  Training, policies and practices that question the validity of \nlegitimate activity, such as peddling or soliciting, could be viewed as culturally insensitive and \nthus exacerbate police-community tensions.  This kind of language can also create a bias in the \nmind of officers against Latinos in general.   We recommend that this policy be reconsidered \nand/or revised, and we further suggest re-wording or revising the language in this section from \n“peddlers and solicitors” to language that simply states that individuals who appear to be \nengaged in illegitimate activity on the street may warrant particular attention.  Such a focus \nwould serve to spotlight attention on suspicious conduct, rather than individuals engaged in \nlegitimate activity.  \n \n  Police officer training programs should explicitly teach officers about cultural \ndifferences.  For example, in some communities a married woman’s religious practice dictates \nthat she not speak directly or make eye contact with a police officer.  That conduct could be \ninterpreted by an officer to be evasive and reflective of a refusal to cooperate.  With proper \ntraining, an officer would be aware of the cultural basis and respond appropriately.  Overall, \ngiven the diversity in Suffolk County, and the growing population of recent immigrants, training \nin cultural diversity will improve community relations.  We understand that SCPD has begun \ncultural awareness and language training as part of its Hate Crimes curriculum; and according to \nCounty Attorney Malafi’s May 11, 2011 letter, recruits now receive 45 hours of cultural \nawareness, sensitivity, diversity, and foreign language training.  Your letter also stated that \nSCPD members receive supplemental cultural awareness and similar training that includes \nseminars administered by the Anti Defamation League and other organizations.  We commend \nSCPD for these efforts and encourage SCPD to continue to expand sensitivity training.  This \ntraining should be mandatory for all officers.  This will improve communication and reduce \ntensions that can arise from cultural misunderstandings.  \n \n25 \n \n\n \n  One way to identify the need for greater cultural sensitivity is to obtain assistance in the \ndevelopment of policies, procedures and training programs from members of the various \ncommunities in Suffolk County.  Section 18.2 of the Department Manual establishes a Training \nCommittee made up of representatives from various sections of the department.  We recommend \nestablishing a community advisory committee, reflecting the diversity of cultures in the County, \nto work with that committee, to advise the Police Commissioner regarding cultural sensitivity \ntraining, and to ensure that policies and procedures reflect an understanding of the differences \nthat exist in different communities.  \n \n  Similarly, regular interaction between community members and precinct commanders \nwould increase officer sensitivity and positive interactions.  In certain precincts, SCPD holds \n“First Tuesday” meetings, which all residents of the precinct can attend and voice their concerns.  \nThese meetings are commendable, and SCPD should consider expanding this program or \nappropriate offshoots to all precincts.   \n \nWe also recommend that SCPD consider creating Community Precinct Councils, a \nprogram which has achieved great success in other jurisdictions, including the City of New York.  \nTypically, councils consist of members of various constituencies and communities in each \nprecinct.  The councils meet regularly, help inform the precinct command structure of issues \naffecting each community, and act as a forum for discussion between various groups, identifying \ncommon interests and breaking down cultural barriers.   \n   \nF)  SCPD Should Engage the Latino Community On An Informal Basis  \n \nSCPD should endeavor to “take the pulse of the community” on a routine and informal \nbasis.  Interviewing community members in a nontraditional police environment, in a capacity \nthat does not involve law enforcement action or procedure, may lessen trepidation in the \ncommunity and increase the likelihood of open dialogue.  The topic of hate crimes and \ncommunity sentiment toward the police on the issue may therefore become an ongoing dialogue, \nnot merely one that arises due to unfortunate circumstances.  \n \nAs we recommended during our tours, SCPD should consider conducting its own \nresearch to determine citizen satisfaction with the police.  We understand that the SCPD has \nbegun surveying residents by Internet, U.S. mail, and telephone and compiling the results.  \nSurveys have been made available in both English and Spanish.  We encourage SCPD to \ncontinue to make surveys available, in both English and non-English languages relevant to the \ncommunity, in places of worship, supermarkets, schools, and other areas where people \ncongregate.   \n \n  According to SCPD’s online citizen satisfaction survey, which tallied responses from \n2007 through 2011, residents’ views of SCPD seemed to improve overall, with the percentage of \nrespondents rating SCPD as “excellent” increasing in five categories measured (“helpfulness,” \n“knew how to handle my problem,” “treated me fairly,” “professional conduct,” and “response \ntime”).  The percentage of respondents rating SCPD as “improvement needed” also fell in the \nfive categories.  However, the numbers were not divided by ethnicity, so it is unclear whether \nLatinos, for instance, collectively experienced an improvement in SCPD services.   \n \n26 \n \n\n \n  And in a series of IAB quality service audits that involves surveys of citizens who \ntelephoned SCPD for assistance, IAB only managed to survey one LEP individual between April \nand May in 2011.  The previous year, IAB surveyed 15 LEP individuals during the same time \nperiod.   Another survey compiled on May 18, 2011, which asked respondents a variety of \nquestions about SCPD service and broke the results down by precinct, seems to indicate positive \nresults – at least according to the limited survey results with which we were provided.  Between \n74 and 92 percent of respondents said they were “overall … satisfied with my entire interaction” \nwith SCPD.  However, the survey results SCPD provided to DOJ only included responses to \nquestion numbers 4, 13, 18, and 19.  Answers to other questions, such as number 5 (“The 911 \nOperator/Desk Officer who received my initial call communicated with me in the language I \nspoke, or connected me with someone who did”) were not provided.  SCPD did not provide us \nwith the survey results to 16 of the 20 questions.  In addition, it is again unclear how many \nrespondents are Latino and non-Latino, so it is unclear how much progress, if any, is being made \nbuilding a relationship with the Latino community.   \n \nSCPD should take steps to ensure that surveys correctly reflect its relationship with the \nLatino community in particular and not just its relationship with the county as a whole.  In \naddition to knowing the race or ethnicity of respondents, it would also be helpful to know the \ntotal number of surveys provided (i.e., how many surveys were not returned). \n \nIn addition, SCPD may wish to review research conducted by the Rand Corporation as \npart of a collaborative agreement with the City of Cincinnati, Ohio.17  Such research can assist \nthe department in learning the cause, nature, and extent of community disengagement.  Another \nconsideration would be to transform the new “research section” of SCPD as part of a dedicated \naudit function and inspection section.  Specifically, all data that are currently entered into all \ndatabases (all enforcement actions and procedures, investigation, complaints, incident reports, \netc.) should have dedicated software to articulate trend analysis by each individual variable.  This \nform of predictive policing enables departments to anticipate trends and better serve the \ncommunity.18   \n \n* * * * * \n   \n                                                 \n17  See Ridgeway, et al., “Police-Community Relations in Cincinnati,” prepared by the Rand \nCorporation, available at http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG853 (last visited  July 12, \n2011). \n18  SCPD may wish to work with local universities to examine police empirical data and \noutside independent analysis. \n27 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \nAlthough the SCPD has made some advances in revising its practices to enhance its \npolicing techniques and relationship with the Latino community, we strongly urge the SCPD to \nadopt these technical assistance recommendations.
