    "summary": "<p>On June 13, 2000, thirty-one minor children in the legal custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families (\"DCAF\") filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The named plaintiffs were represented by the advocacy organization Children's Rights and by private counsel. Plaintiffs sought certification of a class of all children who are or will be in the legal custody of DCAF as an alleged or adjudicated dependent child; plaintiffs also sought certification of a subclass of all children who are black or perceived by DCAF as black. They asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that systemic deficiencies in the operation of DCAF subjected children in the state's care to harm or an unreasonable risk of harm.</p><p>The alleged problems included: overuse of shelters; failing to comply with permanency plans; keeping siblings apart; overcrowding of residential facilities; overworking of caseworkers; denying children safe and permanent homes; overmedicating children; using non-least restrictive placements; failure to provide for foster children's education; operating a foster care system for \"financial benefit\"; and discriminating on the basis of race and ethnicity, particularly against black children.</p><p>On August 30, 2000, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding new claims, including challenges brought under the Adoption and Safe Families Act; Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment; and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.</p><p>On September 11, 2000, plaintiffs moved to certify the class. On October 27, 2000, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Both motions were referred to Magistrate Judge Robert L. Dube.</p><p>On April 20, 2001, Magistrate Judge Dube issued a Report and Recommendation largely denying the defendants' motion to dismiss. The Magistrate denied defendants' motion with respect to all counts, except for the EPSDT claims, for which the Magistrate dismissed certain of the named plaintiffs. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, No. 00-2116-CIV-Moreno Dube, 2001 WL 1840843 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 20, 2001). Defendants subsequently filed objections to the R&R.</p><p>On May 10, 2001, Magistrate Judge Dube issued a Report and Recommendation largely granting plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The Magistrate certified plaintiffs' proposed class and subclass, but excluded certain groups because they had been members of prior classes. Specifically, the Magistrate excluded the following from the class and subclass: (a) children who reside in Broward/District 10; (b) children who were in the custody of DCAF prior to July 24, 1995, but only for claims which arose prior to that date; and (c) any claims for the failure to provide mental health and/or developmental services. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, No. 00-2116-CIV, 2001 WL 1400051 (S.D. Fla. May 10, 2001). Defendants filed objections to this R&R.</p><p>In the meantime, on March 23, 2001, plaintiff Leslie F. moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin defendants from terminating her foster care services. Leslie F. had turned eighteen but was still enrolled in high school.  On April 30, 2001, the Court (District Judge Federico A. Moreno) denied the requested preliminary injunction. The Court held that, inter alia, Leslie F. lacked standing because she had not yet had her benefits terminated (and thus had not suffered an injury in fact), and that her claims were not yet ripe. Plaintiff appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, while also seeking a temporary injunction from the District Court pending appeal. The Court (Judge Moreno) again denied plaintiff's request, noting that defendants had agreed to continue to provide services for 45 days or until the Eleventh Circuit ruled. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, No. 00-2116-CIV-MORENO, 2001 WL 1840845 (S.D. Fla. June 8, 2001). Plaintiff subsequently appealed this ruling as well. The two appeals were consolidated by the Eleventh Circuit.</p><p>On October 15, 2001, the defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss. The defendants argued that the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and that the Court must abstain under the Younger v. Harris doctrine. At this time, the defendants' objections to the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation denying defendants' motion to dismiss was still under consideration by the Court.</p><p>On December 4, 2001, the District Court (Judge Moreno) granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court held that plaintiffs' claims under the ASFA were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), and that certain of plaintiffs' Title VI claims were barred by Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001) and Harris v. James, 127 F.3d 993 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that, by reading Sandoval in pari materia with Harris, the disparate impact regulations do not contain a substantive private right under disparate impact regulations). The Court also abstained under Younger from considering plaintiffs' substantive and procedural due process claims, as well as plaintiffs' claims under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments for plaintiffs not in extended foster care. And while the Court did not dismiss all claims with respect to those plaintiffs, the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice due to plaintiffs' failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The Court also set a deadline within which plaintiffs could file a second amended complaint. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, 180 F. Supp. 2d 1321 (S.D. Fla. 2001). Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Eleventh Circuit.</p><p>On February 14, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit dismissed plaintiffs' appeal regarding the preliminary injunction because the parties had reached a partial settlement agreement. Per the terms of the settlement agreement, certain of the named plaintiffs released defendants from all claims, while others released defendants only from their EPSDT and Title VI claims. Those plaintiffs continued to press their constitutional and ASFA claims by appealing the District Court's December 4 dismissal to the Eleventh Circuit.</p><p>On May 8, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and vacated in part the District Court's order granting defendants' motion to dismiss. The Eleventh Circuit (Judge Carnes) held that (1) certain named plaintiffs' claims had become moot; (2) the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs' statutory claims, as those statutes do not give rise to enforceable rights; and (3) the district court did not abuse its discretion in abstaining under Younger. The Eleventh Circuit only vacated the district court's opinion and remanded with instructions regarding certain named plaintiffs, whose claims were moot or who lacked standing. Thus, this appeal affirmed the district court in all substantive respects and ended the case. 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 984. </p>",

INTRODUCTORY  STATEMENT \n1.  This  is  an  action  for  declaratory  and  injunctive \nrelief pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act  including  42  U.S.C.  §12133. \n2.  This  suit  addresses  the  failure  of  the  Defendants  to \nfollow  the  law  relating  to  the  children  in  Florida  foster \ncare,  and  the  harm  caused by  the  resulting  abuse  and  neglect \nof  the  children  by  the  Defendants. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n3.  Because  this  is  an  action  in  which  the  matter  in \ncontroversy  arises  under  the  constitution  and  the  laws  of  the \nUnited  States,  this  Court  has  jurisdiction over  this \ncontroversy  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§1331  and  1343. \n4.  This  action  arises  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983  and  the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act  to  redress  the  Defendants' \ndeprivation  under  color  of  state  law  of  the  rights,  privileges \nand  immunities  secured  to  Florida's  foster  children by  the \nConstitution  and  laws  of  the  United  States  and  Florida.  The \nfederal  rights  sought  to  be  redressed  are  guaranteed  by  the \nFourteenth Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution. \n5.  This  Court  also  has  jurisdiction pursuant  to  28 \nu.s.c. \n§  2201  and  2202,  as  Plaintiffs  also  seek  a  judgment \n2 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 3 of 60\ndeclaring  Plaintiffs'  rights  and  injunctive  and  other \nequitable  relief. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS \n6.  Approximately  14,000  children  are  presently  in \nfoster  care  in  Florida;  the  children's  lengths  of  stay  and \nexcess  lengths  of  stay  are  set  forth  on  the  attached  schedule \n[Exhibit  A]. \n7.  The  named  plaintiffs  are  acting  on  behalf  of \nthemselves  and  of  the  children  abused,  neglected,  and \nfinancially  exploited by  Florida's  foster  care  system, \nincluding  the  14,000  foster  children  currently  in  the \nDefendants'  custody. \n8.  Plaintiff Ashleigh  Abbott  is  in  foster  care  in \nBroward  County  DCAF/District  10.  Now  5  years  old,  she  has \nbeen  illegally held  in  \"emergency  shelteru  since  March  1998, \nmore  than  2  years,  without  having  been  adjudicated  dependent \nas  to  her  custodial  parent,  who  has  denied  any  abuse  or \nneglect  of  her.  Although  she  has  significantly deteriorated \nin  DCAF's  custody  and  is  now  functioning  at  only  50%  of  her \ncapacity,  the  defendants  continue  to  use  her  as  a  pawn  in \nbattling with  her  custodial  parent  and  have  stated  they  will \nkeep  her  in  foster  care,  in  an  unsuitable  detrimental \ninstitutional  setting  condemned  by  her  dependency  court \n3 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 4 of 60\nguardian  ad  litem,  until  her  parent  \"gives  up,  gives  out  or \ngives  in\".  She  brings  this  action  through  her  next  friend \nBrenda  B.  Shapiro. \n9.  Plaintiffs  Two  Forgotten  Children  are  two  Dade \nCounty  DCAF/District  11  sisters  held  by  the  State  of  Florida \nin  foster  care  since  1986,  when  they  were  4  and  2  years  of \nage.  They  have  never  been  placed  for  adoption.  In  fact, \ndespite  adoption  being  recommended  several  times,  they  are \nstill not  even  available  for  adoption  because  the  Defendants', \ncontrary  to  law,  have  made  no  efforts  to  terminate  the \nparental  rights  of  their non-present  father. \nDuring  their  14  years  in  Florida's  foster  care \nsystem,  the  girls  have  been  subjected  to  rapes,  beatings  and \nneglect.  The  older  girl  was  given  syphilis  when  she  was  nine \nyears  old.  They  have  been  wrongly  separated  from  each  other. \nTheir  minds  have  been  damaged  by  years  of  psychotropic \nmedications  administered with  the  State's  approval  for  the \nconvenience  of  their  caretakers.  They  have  been  locked  up  for \nyears  needlessly  in  restricted,  locked  facilities  and  held \nthere  as  virtual  captives,  to  the  financial  gain  of  the \nfacilities  and  DCAF. \nThe  older  girl,  now  18,  has  a  permanent  mental \ndisability  severe  enough  that  in  approximately  1994  DCAF \n4 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 5 of 60\napplied  for  and  obtained  federal  disability benefits  for  her, \nthen  intercepted  the  resulting  federal  funds  as  representative \npayee;  thereafter  DCAF  then  wrongly  denied  her  access  to  the \nindependent  living  program  because  of  State-caused \ndisabilities  and  the  fact  she  had  no  savings  due  to  DCAF's \ntaking  her  federal  SSI  funds.  Although  of mixed  Hispanic \ndescent,  the  girls  were  labeled  and  treated  as  Black  children, \nand  discriminated  against  in  their multiple  placements  and \nDCAF's  denial  of  timely  access  to  real  permanency.  The  girls \nare  acting  through  their  guardian  ad  litem Brenda  B.  Shapiro. \n10.  Foster  Child  #93-15027  is  an  11-year-old  Dade  County \nchild who  has  languished  in  foster  care  for  years.  Separated \nfrom  her  siblings  for  no  reason,  she  finally  had  parental \nrights  terminated,  and  was  then  placed  for  adoption  with  a \nlicensed  foster  family,  the  father  of  which  already  had  a \ncriminal  record  for  sexually  abusing  children.  The  child \nlived nearly  12  months  in  that  house,  subjected  to  unspeakable \nabuse  before  criminal  charges  were  instituted against  the \nfoster  father.  A  suitable  adoptive  parent  has  now  been  found, \nbut  the  Defendants  are  capriciously  and  arbitrarily refusing \nto  let  the  child have  a  real  family.  The  child  is  separated \nfrom  her  siblings,  is  devastated  and  is  suffering  greatly. \n5 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 6 of 60\nShe  brings  this  action  through  her  guardian  ad  litem Kristi \nKassebaum. \n11.  Plaintiff  14-year  old Ashley  Rhodes-Courter  spent \nnine  years  in  Florida's  foster  system,  being moved  14 \ndifferent  times.  She  was  periodically separated  from  her \nbrother,  Plaintiff  J.J.  No  proper  diligent  search  was  timely \ndone  for  a  suitable  relative  placement,  although  it was \ndiscovered  years  after  the  fact  that  an  appropriate  aunt  was \nwilling  to  care  for  Plaintiff Ashley.  Conversely,  one  of \nAshley's  placements  was  with  an  unsuitable  relative  who  had \npreviously  had  his  own  children  taken  from  him. \nDCAF  District  6/Hillsborough  County  DCAF  kept  Ashley \nfor  nearly  a  year  at  an  over-crowded  foster  home  where  the \nfoster  children were  subjected  to  beatings  and  horrible \nsadistic  abuse,  including  hot  sauce  applied  to  the  tongue, \nfaces  dunked  in  the  toilet bowl  and  kept  there  until  the  child \ngasped  for  breath,  and  to  beatings  and  ridicule.  Plaintiff \nJ.J.  spent  even  longer  at  the  same  overcrowded  abusive  house. \nWhen  the  child  abuse  \"Hotline\"  was  called,  DCAF  ignored  the \nabuses,  exonerated  the  foster  parents  and  kept  the  home  open, \nallowing  the  foster  parents  to  keep  custody  of  children who \nhad  been  removed  from  their  own  families  for  neglect  or  for \nmuch  less  serious  abuse  than  that  being  inflected  in  the \n6 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 7 of 60\nfoster  homes.  Ashley  brings  this  action  through  her  adoptive \nparents  and  next  friends  Gay  and  Philip  Courter;  J.J.  brings \nthis  action  through  his  next  friend Mary Miller. \n12.  Plaintiffs  Two  Sisters  from  Manatee  County  have  been \ninvolved  with  Florida's  foster  care  system  since  1986,  when \nthey  were  4  and  2.  Their  father's  parental  rights  were \nterminated  in  1987;  their mother  was  having  trouble  maki11g \nends  meet  as  a  recently  divorced  single  parent  with  few  job \nskills.  Instead of  providing  services,  DCAF  convinced  her  to \ninstead  surrender  the  girls  so  they  could  be  adopted  and  have \na  better  life. \nThe  adoptive  parents  handpicked  by  DCAF  were  abusive \nbeyond  imagination.  The  girls  were  subjected  to  innumerable \nbeatings  and  other  bizarre  torture,  including  being  tied  to \nthe  bed  by  wrists  and  ankles,  being  made  to  sleep  on  concrete \nsurrounded  by  a  brick  cage  at  night,  and  punished  if  the  two \ngirls  spoke  to  each  other  or  any  one  else.  DCAF's  Hotline \nreceived  several  calls  reporting  the  abuse,  including  calls  in \n1990,  1993,  1994  and  1997  before  finally  taking  the  girls  back \ninto  foster  care  in March  1997  after  a  total  of  10  years  of \nwhat  DCAF  itself  called  egregious  abuse.  Since  then,  DCAF \nchose  not  to  even  attempt  to  seek  a  permanent  family  for  the \ngirls,  moving  them  from  one  unsuitable  placement  to  another. \n7 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 8 of 60\nIn  1999,  a  guardian  ad  litem  located  the  girls'  natural \nmother  who  asked  to  adopt  the  girls.  Although  DCAF  had  no \nother  options  [and  was  not  even  looking  for  an  adoptive \nplacement  for  the  girls],  DCAF  initially objected  to  either  of \nthe  girls  even  having  contact.  When  the  girls  asked  to  be \nadopted  by  their  mom  and  step-dad,  DCAF  fought  strenuously \nagainst  the  adoption  for  months  but  provided  not  even  a  single \nwritten  reason  to  support  its  objection. \nThe  official  DCAF  permanency  goal  for  the  younger  girl \ncontinued  for  more  than  three  years  to  be  the  oxymoronic  \"long \nterm  foster  care\",  clearly  contrary  to  law.  Also  contrary  to \nlaw,  there  was  no  case  plan  in  effect  for  the  younger  girl  for \nseveral  months,  even  though  DCAF  was  obligated  to  provide \nproper  case  management  services  and  received  federal  and  state \nfunds  for  case  management  services  it was  not  providing.  In \nDecember  1999,  DCAF  said  a  case  plan  would  be  done  after  the \nDecember  judicial  review;  it was  not  submitted  until  June  1, \n2000,  a  clear  violation  of  state  and  federal  law. \nFor  several  months  DCAF  also  failed  to  provide  the \nchildren  and  their  counsel  with  copies  of  court  papers, \nfurther  violating  the  girls'  due  process  rights.  It  is  not \nknown  at  this  time  what  has  happened  to  the  room  and  board \nfunds  the  federal  government  is  paying  DCAF  to  keep  the \n8 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 9 of 60\nyounger  child  in  long  term  foster  care  - the  natural  mom  and \nstep-dad  are  taking  no  money.  The  girls bring  this  action \nthrough  their  next  friend  Donald  Hadsock. \n13.  Natalie  and  Nathan  are  two  young  Monroe  County \nchildren  taken by  the  defendants  into  foster  custody  and  held \nthere more  than  six months  [200  days]  without  any  adjudication \nof  dependency  ever  being  entered.  During  their  stay  as  foster \nchildren,  the  caretakers  provided  by  defendants  neglected  the \nchildren  and  failed  to  provide  proper  care.  The  defendants \nheld  the  children  in  foster  placements  with  persons  unknown  to \nthem  although  perfectly suitable  relatives  were  available  and \nwilling  to  care  for  the  children  during  any  time  out  of  home \ncare  was  necessary.  This  is  another  case  where  the  defendants \nand  their  department  used  the  children  as  leverage  to  try  to \nmake  parents  admit  to  abuse  or  neglect  which  did  not  happen, \nignoring  the  illegality of  such  conduct  and  the  unfair \nviolation  of  the  children's  rights  resulting  from  such \ntyrannical  conduct.  The  children  bring  this  action  through \ntheir parents  Carrie  and  Nick  Nowatney. \n14.  Plaintiff Omar  D.  is  an  Orange  County/District  7 \nyoungster  who  was  taken  from  his  mother  years  ago,  due  to \nalleged neglect,  and  placed with  an  unsuitable  adoptive  parent \nwho  routinely  neglected  the  child  and  his  siblings.  A  flight \n9 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 10 of 60\nattendant,  the  adoptive  mother  frequently  left  the  children \nalone  with  no  adult  supervision.  When  home,  she  often  abused \nthe  child  and  his  siblings.  DCAF  failed  to  properly \ninvestigate multiple  Hotline  calls  about  the  abuse  before \nfinally  removing  the  child  and  his  siblings  from  the  home. \nIn  the  next  foster  home,  the  child was  again \nsubjected  to  multiple  incidents  of  abuse  and  neglect.  When \nDCAF  finally  decided  to  do  a  proper  investigation,  they  found \nthat  the  foster  father  had  a  criminal  background  involving \nchild  abuse  and  had  had  that  background  before  being  licensed \nas  a  foster  parent.  DCAF  also  found  DCAF  District  10  licensed \nthe  foster  father  anyway  and  neglected  to  advise  DCAF  District \n7  of  the  foster  father's  criminal  child  abuse  background  when \nthe  family  had  relocated  from  Broward  County  to  Orlando.  DCAF \nDistrict  7  had  placed  the  already  abused  and  traumatized  child \nin  the  foster  home  without  any  background  check  or  risk \nassessment  of  it.  The  child brings  this  action  through  his \nnext  friend  Betty  J. \n15.  Plaintiff  P.D.B.  is  a  16-year-old  Palm  Beach  County \nfoster  child under  DCAF  supervision  from  10  days  of  age  until \nage  10,  then  in  foster  care  since  age  10.  Since  age  10,  he \nwas  moved  more  than  18  times,  and  has  been  denied  a  good \n10 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 11 of 60\npermanent  family.  He  brings  this  action  through  his  guardian \nad  litem Kathleen  Fayette. \n16.  Plaintiff R.C.  is  a  13-year-old  Palm  Beach  County \nchild  kept  by  DCAF  in  a  temporary  shelter  for  more  than  12 \nmonths.  She  brings  this  action  through  her  mother. \n17.  Plaintiffs  T.C.  and  C.C.  are  Palm  Beach  County \nDCAF/District  9  children  placed by  DCAF  in  a  abusive  foster \nhome  in  Belle  Glade,  where  they  were  beaten  and  kept  in  a \ncloset;  additionally plaintiff C.  C.  was  sexually  abused. \nDCAF  \"investigated\"  its  foster  parents,  covered  up  the  wrong \ndoing  and  kept  the  foster  home  open.  The  children  bring  this \naction  through  their mother  V.J. \n18.  Plaintiff  foster  child M.I.  is  two  years  old.  He \nwas  neglected  in  a  foster  home  in  Palm  Beach  County,  and  had \nto  be  taken  to  the  hospital  before  receiving  treatment  or \ncare.  He  brings  this  action  through  his  mother  B.C. \n19.  District  9  Plaintiff S.M.  is  a  16-year-old who  has \nspent  virtually her  entire  life  in  foster  care.  The  child  and \nher  brother  had  been  placed  in  one  foster  home  for  two  years, \nand  had  bonded  to  the  good,  loving  foster  parents.  When  the \nnatural  parents'  rights  were  terminated  and  the  children \nbecame  available  for  adoption,  DCAF  illegally denied  the \nfoster  parents'  request  to  adopt  the  children.  DCAF  then \n11 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 12 of 60\nseparated  the  child  from  her  brother,  and  both  children \ncontinued  to  be  held  in  foster  care  limbo.  DCAF  ignored \nrecommendations  of  the  child's  guardian  ad  litem  and  instead \nrequired  her  to  be  adopted  by  an  unfit,  inappropriate mother \nwhom  DCAF  no  longer  licenses  as  a  foster  parent.  The  child \nhas  continued  to  be  placed  in  an  ever  increasing  number  of \nplacements  and  was  held  unlawfully  for  12  months  [rather  than \n72  hours]  at  the  crisis  unit  of  a  residential  treatment  center \nbefore  being  officially placed  in  a  residential  treatment \ncenter  in  June  1999,  where  she  remains  to  this  day,  generating \nstill more  fees  for  the  facility.  She  brings  this  action \nthrough  her  guardian  ad  litem. \n20.  Plaintiff  C.W.  is  a  12-year-old child  who  has  been \nheld  in  a  temporary  shelter  in  District  9  since  May  1999,  even \nthough  the  Defendants  know  the  placement  is  inappropriate  for \nher  and  for  the  other  children  there.  She  brings  this  action \nthrough  her  mother. \n21.  Plaintiff  T.M.  is  a  14-year-old  foster  child wrongly \nseparated  from  her  siblings.  District  9  DCAF  has  placed her \nin  several  different  unsuitable  placement  including  places \nwhere  she  has  been  neglected  and  places  where  she  was  not \nwanted.  In  one  foster  home  she  was  one  of  8  children  DCAF \nplaced  in  the  house,  violating  the  S-child maximum.  Her \n12 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 13 of 60\nattempts  to  be  properly placed were  ignored,  and  DCAF  took  her \nto  a  home  where  the  foster  mother  had  already  told  DCAF  the \nchild was  not  wanted,  and  left her  there  after  dark,  only  to \nbe  told  to  leave  by  the  foster  mother,  even  though  the \nneighborhood  was  not  a  safe  one.  She  brings  this  action \nthrough  her  mother  L.M. \n22.  Plaintiffs  L.S.  and  L.S.  are  two  fostPr  children  in \nthe  Defendants'  custody  in  Palm  Beach  County.  Born  in  1991 \nand  1993  respectively,  the  girls  have  been  in  foster  care \nsince March  1995.  DCAF  did  not  perform  a  proper  diligent \nsearch  to  locate  suitable  caretakers  and  incorrectly  told  an \nuncle  that  relatives  are  not  allowed  to  adopt.  DCAF  placed \nthe  girls  in  an  inappropriate  place.  DCAF  ignored  complaints \nabout  the  placement  and  kept  the  children  there  for  years  even \nthough  it was  known  to  be  a  more  appropriate  placement  for \nteenage  girls  rather  than  young  children.  The  girls  were \ntraumatized  by  DCAF's  inappropriate  handling  of  their  case, \nand  by  the  several  years  delay  in  being  moved  to  a  good \npermanent  family.  They  bring  this  action  through  their \nguardian  ad  litem Barbara  Wilt. \n23.  Plaintiff H.S.  is  a  16-year-old  Palm  Beach  County \nfoster  child.  In  1996,  when  he  was  12  years  old,  his  mother \npassed  away  and  his  father  turned  him  in  to  DCAF,  claiming  he \n13 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 14 of 60\nwas  not  the  child's  biological  father.  DCAF  has  neither \nlocated  any  natural  father  nor  any  good  permanent  substitute \nfather.  He  has  been  moved  from  place  to  place,  missed  more \nthan  one  month  of  school,  having  spent  many  days  in  DCAF's \noffice  rather  than  in  school.  He  has  inadequate  clothing,  and \nhas  been  completely  neglected  by  Defendants.  Contrary  to  law, \nDCAF  has  not  provided  him  with  a  guardian  ad  litem.  Ire  brings \nthis  action  through  his  personal  attorneys,  Michelle  Hankey, \nBarbara  Burch,  John  Walsh  and  James  Walsh. \n24.  Plaintiff  foster  child  L.G.  was  taken  into  Palm \nBeach  County  foster  care  as  a  young  infant.  The  child was \nneglected  and  failed  to  thrive  in  an  inappropriate  foster \nhouse.  By  age  13  months,  the  child was  still not  on  solid  food \nand  was  kept  in  her  crib  the  majority  of  her  time.  The \npediatrician  could  not  effectively  treat  the  child because  the \nDCAF  workers  who  took  the  child  to  the  doctor's  office \nprovided  no  information  about  the  child.  Although  an  adoptive \nhome  was  located,  DCAF  has  not  yet  provided  the  child with \npermanency.  She  brings  this  action  through  her  guardian  ad \nlitem Al  Mann. \n25.  Plaintiff  T.G.  is  a  9  year  old  District  9  foster \nchild.  She  has  been  in  four  different  foster  houses  in  the \npast  three  years.  She  has  seen  her  four  siblings  only  once \n14 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 15 of 60\nduring  the  past  year.  In  her  current  DCAF  selected placement, \nthe  children  sleep  in  a  room  attached  to  a  converted  garage. \nThere  is  no  air  conditioning  in  the  children's  room,  although \nthe  foster  parent  sleeps  in  the  main  house  which  does  have  air \nconditioning.  The  child  is  not  being  fed  properly.  In  a \nprior  placement,  she  was  subjected  to  physical  abuse  by  the \nfoster  mother,  including  having  her  arm  twisted behind  her \nback  and  her  nose  twisted.  She  brings  this  action  through  her \nguardian  ad  litem Al  Mann. \n26.  Plaintiff  J.G.  is  a  14  year  old  Ocala  boy  who  spent \nseveral  years  in  Hillsborough  foster  care.  He  and  his  sister \nPlaintiff H.B.  were  taken  into  foster  care  when  DCAF  claimed \nthey  were  being  neglected  because  their  parents'  house  was \nmessy.  Their  parents  would  not  capitulate  to  DCAF's  charges \nand  were  ultimately  exonerated.  Meanwhile,  the  children were \nheld  for  years  in  abusive,  neglected  foster  houses. \nPlaintiff  J.G.  was  sexually  abused;  both  Plaintiffs \nwere  subjected  to  bizarre punishments.  DCAF  either  ignored \nHotline  calls  reporting  the  abuse  or  conducted  an \ninvestigation  designed  to  exonerate  the  foster  parents  and \nkeep  the  overcrowded  abusive  house  open.  Because  the  house  was \nkept  open,  even  more  children  suffered  even  more  abuse,  all \n15 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 16 of 60\nbecause  of  the  Defendants'  tolerance  of  foster  system  abuse. \nThese  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  through  their parents. \n27.  Plaintiff Lauren  C.  will  be  two  years  old  in  July \n2000.  While  in  foster  care,  she  was  placed  in  an  abusive, \nneglected  foster  placement  in  Flagler  County  where  she  was \nsubjected  to  repeated  abuses.  The  traumatic  brain  injuries \ninflicted upon  this  child by  DCAF's  designated  foster  parents \nhave  left her  partly paralyzed  and  with  impaired  vision  and \nspeech.  She  brings  this  action  through  her  attorney  ad  litem \nRhoda  Goodson. \n28.  Plaintiff  DCAF/District  1  Walton  County  sisters \nJennifer  and  Beronica  are  two  foster  children  now  17  and  15 \nyears  of  age  held  in  foster  care  for  more  than  3  years  and \nharmed  and  abused  in  at  least  three  placements.  When  they \nreported  the  abuse,  they  were  not  listened  to.  When  they  ran \nfrom  the  still abusive  foster  homes,  pick  up  orders  were \nissued because  DCAF  had  put  these  children  in  a  situation \nwhere  they  had  to  choose  between  being  abused  or  violating  a \ncourt  order  that  required  them  to  stay where  DCAF  put  them. \nThey  bring  this  action  through  their  next  friend  Brenda  B. \nShapiro. \n29.  Plaintiffs  R.B.  and  R.B.  are  13  year  old  District  9 \nTwins.  They  have  been  stuck  in  foster  care  since  1997. \n16 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 17 of 60\nSuitable  relative  caretakers  in  other  states  were  never \ncontacted.  One  of  the  children  has  a  cleft palate  and  other \nmedical  needs  which  the  Defendants  have  neglected  to  do \nanything  about.  They  bring  this  action  through  their \nattorney/guardian  ad  litem  John  Walsh. \nIV.  DEFENDANTS \n30.  Defendant  Jeb  Bush  is  the  Governor  of  the  State  u£ \nFlorida,  the  head  of  the  Executive  Branch  of  government  and \nthe  person  responsible  proper  operation  of  the  foster  system \nand  for  the  hiring  and  continued  employment  of  Kathleen \nKearney,  Secretary  of  the  State  of  Florida  Children  and \nFamilies  Services  [''DCAF\"],  Defendant  Bush  is  sued  in  his \nofficial  capacity.  By  law,  Defendant  Bush  is  responsible  for \nsupervising  Defendant  Kearney.  He  is  also  responsible  for  the \nproper  administration  of  DCAF,  proposing  a  proper  budget  for \nDCAF  to  the  legislature  and  assuring  that  DCAF  operates  in \nconformity  with  the  law  and  State  plans  submitted  to  the \nfederal  government  allowing  state  qualification  for  funding \nunder  Title  IV  of  the  Social  Security Act,  under  the  Child \nAbuse  Prevention  and  Treatment  and  Adoption  Reform  Act,  and \nthe  Adoption  and  Safe  Families  Act. \nDefendant  Bush  is  also  responsible  under  State  law  for \nseeing  that  DCAF  complies  with  the  mandatory  provisions  of \n17 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 18 of 60\nChapter  39,  Florida  Statutes  and  Chapter  65c  of  the  Florida \nAdministrative  Code  relating  to  dependency  cases,  foster  care \nand  termination  of  parental  rights,  and  is  responsible  for \nensuring  that  DCAF  protects  the  federally  protected  civil \nrights  of  the  foster  children  in  state  care.  Additionally, \nsince  his  inauguration  in  January  1999,  Defendant  Bush  has \npersonally directed  the  operation  of  Florida's  foster  Cdre \nsystem  and  dictated  the  actions  to  be  taken  by  the  other \ndefendants  in  the  operation  of  Florida's  foster  care  system  in \na  manner  contrary  to  law  and  proper,  competent  professional \nstandards. \n31.

Under  Florida  law,  Defendant \nKearney  is  responsible  for  supervising,  directing,  organizing, \nplanning,  administering  and  executing  the  functions  of  DCAF \nand  for  seeing  that  DCAF  performance  is  in  compliance  with \nfederal  law  to  qualify  for  appropriate  funding  under  Title  IV, \nand  for  operating  the  foster  care  system  in  such  a  way  as  to \nprotect  the  lives,  safety,  health  and  rights  of  the  children \nheld by  Florida  in  foster  care.  In  this  role,  she  serves  at \nthe  pleasure  of  and  subject  to  the  direction  of  Defendant \nBush. \n18 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 19 of 60\n32.  Defendants  Bates,  Awad,  Tibbs,  Johnson,  Richard, \nDixon,  Morin,  Gibbons,  Brown,  Scott,  Auslander,  Davenport, \nHoward,  Gray  and  Cline  are  the  District Administrators  of \nDCAF's  districts  1  through  15,  respectively.  They  are  sued  in \ntheir official  capacities  and  under  color  of  state  law.  They \nserve  at  the  pleasure  and  direction  of  Defendants  Kearney  and \nBush;  each  servPs  as  the  local  official  in  charge  in  each  of \nthe  15  DCAF  districts  to  see  that  the  children  in  Florida \nfoster  care  are  free  from  harm  and  properly  cared  for  while  in \nstate  foster  custody.  They  also  have  the  legal  duty  to  see \nthat  the  foster  care  system  is  operated  in  accordance  with \nfederal  and  Florida  law.  They  are  each  also  obligated  to  see \nthat  proper  professional  standards  and  judgment  are  exercised \nin  determining  and  providing  for  the  protection,  familial  and \npermanency  needs  of  the  children  in  the  temporary  custody \nknown  as  foster  care,  and  to  see  that  the  system  is  not \noperated  recklessly or  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nneeds,  safety,  lives  and  rights  of  Florida's  foster  children. \n33.  At  all  times  and  in  all  respects  relevant  to  the \nclaims  herein,  Defendants  Bush,  Kearney  and  District \nAdministrators  were  acting  in  their  official  capacities  and \nunder  color  of  state  law. \n19 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 20 of 60\nV.  CLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n34.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  on  behalf  of  themselves \nand  all  others  similarly  situated pursuant  to  Rule  23(a)  and \n23  (b) (2)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  The  class \nconsists  of  all  children  currently  in  the  custody  of  the \nFlorida  foster  care  system. \n35.  Every  child  in  foster  care  is  directly  impacted  by \nthe  Defendants'  deficient  operation  of  Florida's  foster  care \nsystem.  Florida's  foster  care  system  has  been  described  as \nthe  worst  for  children  in America  by  the  National  Coalition \nfor  Child  Protection  Reform.  As  operated,  the  Florida  foster \ncare  system  is  the  single  biggest  abuser,  neglecter  and \nexploiter  of  children  in  Florida.  Children  who  have  the \nmisfortune  of  being  taken  into  Florida's  foster  care  system \nroutinely  have  their  rights  trampled  upon  and  are  likely  to  be \nharmed  by  the  experience. \n36.  This  action  qualifies  as  a  class  action  pursuant  to \nRule  23(b)  in  that: \na.  There  are  presently  approximately  14,000  children \ncurrently  in  Florida  foster  care,  including more  than \n6,300  Black  children.  Many  of  these  children have  been \nin  foster  care  longer  than  the  legally established  limit. \nMany  of  these  children  are  being  held  in  emergency \n20 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 21 of 60\nshelter  status  for  longer  than  30  days  without  having \nbeing  adjudicated  dependant.  The  named  plaintiffs  are \nrepresentative  of  all  foster  children  who  have  been \nabused,  neglected  or  financially  exploited  in  foster  care \nand  all  children  currently  in  foster  care,  regardless  of \nwhether  they  have  been  adjudicated  dependent. \nb.  The  Plaintiff  class  of  children  in  Florida  foster \ncare  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all members  is \nimpracticable.  Even  joinder  of  the  more  than  6,300  Black \nchildren  is  impracticable.  Further,  throughout  the  state, \nthere  are  hundreds  of  cases  where  parental  rights  should \nhave  been  terminated but  termination  proceedings  have  not \nbeen  timely  begun  by  DCAF.  Additionally,  thousands  of \nchildren  have  been  improperly  assigned  a  permanency  goal \nof  long  term  foster  care,  which  damages  the  children by \ndenying  them  good  permanent  families  and  allowing  the \nchildren  to  be  further  financially  exploited by  the \nDefendants  and  their providers,  and  increases  the  risk  of \nfurther  abuse  and  neglect. \nc.  With  each  passing  day,  the  number  of  children who \nhave  been  too  long  in  foster  care  increases. \nd.  Each  of  the  class  members  is  in  the  physical \ncustody  and  legal  custody  of  DCAF  and  is  and  has  been \n21 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 22 of 60\nadversely  affected by  the  overcrowding  in  foster  care  and \nby  DCAF's  failure  to  comply  with  the  foster  care  time \nlimits,  and  its obligation  to  provide  proper  services  to \nthose  it keeps  in  care. \ne.  The  questions  of  law  and  fact  involved  in  this \ncase  are  common  to  the  class  and  the  claims  of  the \nplaintiffs  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  other  class \nmembers. \nf.  The  representative  parties  will  fairly  and \nadequately  protect  the  interest  of  the  class.  They  bring \nthis  action  through  their well-qualified  representatives, \nincluding  guardians  ad  litem,  parents  and  next  friends. \nThey  are  represented by  geographically  diverse,  competent \ncounsel  including  board  certified civil  trial  lawyers \nwith  experience  in  class  action  litigation  as  well  as \nchild  advocacy. \ng.  The  Defendants  have  acted  and  refused  to  act  on \ngrounds  generally  applicable  to  all members  of  the  class, \nmaking  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  and \ncorresponding  declaratory  relief with  respect  to  the \nclass  as  a  whole. \nh.  The  questions  of  law  or  fact  common  to  members  of \nthe  class  will  predominate  over  any  other  questions \n22 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 23 of 60\naffecting  only  individual  members.  A  class  action  is \nsuperior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and \nefficient  adjudication  of  the  controversy.  There  are \nquestions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the  class  which \ninclude: \n1.  All  members  of  the  class  are  in  Defendants' \nlegal  and  physical  custody; \n2.  All  members  of  the  class  are  currently being \ndenied  or  are  at  risk  of  being  denied  their \nconstitutional  right  to  safety,  receipt  of  care \nconsistent  with  competent  professional  judgment  and \nthe  protections  afforded  to  them  under  Florida  law \nand  the  Florida Administrative  Code  as  a  result  of \nDefendants'  placement  of  them  in  overcrowded, \nunsupervised  foster  homes,  shelters,  and  other \nresidential  facilities  with  other  unscreened,  foster \nchildren; \n3.  Defendants  have  subjected  all members  of  the \nclass  to  imminent  and  substantial  risk  of  harm  due \nto  the  neglectful,  abusive,  violent,  and/or \ndangerous  conditions  in  Florida's  foster  care \nsystem; \n4.  Defendants  have  failed  to  monitor  the  care  of \n23 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 24 of 60\nall members  of  the  class  and  to  ensure  by  proper \ncaseworker  visitation  that  their placements  are \nsafe; \n5.  Defendants  have  subjected  all  class  members  to \nthe  substantial  risk  of  truancy  and  its  associated \nharms; \n6.  Defendants  have  subjected  all members  of  the \nclass  to  the  risk  of  being  allowed  to  remain  on  the \nstreet  after  they  have  left  their  placements  and \ntheir  location  is  known  to  Defendants  thereby \nexposing  them  to  the  dangers  of  homelessness  and  a \nlack  of  supervision; \n7.  Defendants  have  acted  or  refused  to  act  on \ngrounds  generally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby \nmaking  injunctive  relief with  respect  to  the  class \nas  a  whole  an  appropriate  remedy;  and \n8.  Defendants  have  treated  and  continue  to  treat \nchildren  of  color  differently,  with  resulting  harm. \ni.  To  the  extent  Defendants  are  the  legal  custodian \nof  these  children,  they  have  an  inescapable  inherent \nconflict  of  interest  and  are  not  in  a  position  to  bring \nthis  action  against  the  Defendants  or  the  Department \nitself on  behalf  of  these  children. \n24 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 25 of 60\nj.  All  members  of  the  class  seek  to  vindicate \n[through  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and,  to  the  extent  pertinent, \nthe  Americans  with  Disabilities Act]  rights,  privileges \nand  immunities  that  are  secured  to  them  by  Title  IV  of \nthe  Social  Security Act,  the  Child Abuse  Prevention  and \nTreatment  and  Adoption  Reform  Act,  and  the  related \nFlorida  foster  care  program,  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act,  The  Adoptions  and  Safe  Families  Act  and \nthe  Eighth  and  Fourteenth Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \nVI.  STATEMENT  OF  FACTS \n37.  Under  federal  law,  Florida's  foster  care  system must \nprovide  services  to  effectuate  the  child's  return  to  the \nnatural  parents  in  not  more  than  12  months,  if such \nreunification  can  be  done  safely  and  consistent  with  the \nchild's  best  interests.  If  reunification  cannot  be \naccomplished,  the  foster  care  system  is  obligated  to  petition \nfor  termination  of  parental  rights  and,  simultaneously, \nconcurrently  locate  and  approve  a  qualified  adoptive  family. \n25 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 26 of 60\n38.  As  of  January  13,  2000,  dependent  children  stay  in \nFlorida  foster  care  for  an  average  of  34.1  months  nearly  three \ntimes  the  legal  limit  established  in  federal  and  state  law. \n39.  Children  in  Florida  foster  care  generate  funds  for \nthe  Florida  foster  care  system  and  for  outside  contract \nproviders  to  whom  the  Defendants,  inappropriately,  give  total \ncontrol  and  deference  over  a  child's  length  of  stay with  a \nparticular provider. \n40.  The  Defendants  are  not  operating  Florida's  foster \ncare  system  properly,  for  the  appropriate  purpose  of  providing \nchildren  with  the  requisite  good  permanent  homes  as  quickly  as \npossible.  The  Defendants  routinely  hold  children  in  emergency \nshelter  care  longer  than  the  maximum  of  2  months  allowed  by \nlaw  and  excessively overuses  an  oxymoronic  \"permanency\"  goal \nof  long  term  foster  custody,  which  keeps  the  children  in  the \nsystem  rather  than  finding  adoptive  families.  This  overuse  of \nlong  term  foster  custody maximizes  federal  revenue  for  DCAF \nand  its  allies,  job  security  for  DCAF  workers  and  rewards \ncontract  providers  with  payments  for  the  foster  children who  -\ncontrary  to  law  - are  not  moved  toward  real  permanency  and  who \nsuffer  harm  while  being  held  as  virtual  hostages  by  the \nDefendants. \n26 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 27 of 60\n41.  Defendants  operate  the  foster  care  system  with  a \nmuch  greater  tolerance  for  child  abuse  committed  by  their  own \nfoster  parents,  group  home  parents  and  institutional  personnel \nwho  benefit  financially  from  the  children's  stay  in  foster \ncare  than  they  show  toward  children  neglected  or  abused \noutside  the  system by  their  own  parents. \n42.  The  Defendants  know  Florida's  foster  care  syslem \noperationally discriminates  against  Black  children  in  several \nways.  The  Defendants  know  Florida's  foster  care  system  treats \nBlack  children  differently  in  taking  them  into  foster  care, \nmoving  them  to  permanency  and  keeping  them  in  the  system. \nThere  is  a  disproportionate  number  of  Black  children  taken \ninto  foster  custody,  a  disproportionately  longer  time  before \nBlack  children  become  available  for  adoption,  and  longer \nlengths  of  stay  in  foster  care  for  Black  children.  The \nDefendants  know  and  have  known  for  years  that  Florida's  foster \ncare  system  treats  children  believed  to  be  Black  differently \nthan  other  children. \n43.  The  Defendants  know  that  the  longer  children  are  in \nfoster  care,  the  more  likely  they  are  to  be  abused  by  their \nDCAF-approved  custodians  or  others  in  the  DCAF-selected \nplacements. \n27 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 28 of 60\n44.  The  Defendants  know  the  longer  a  child  is  in  foster \ncare,  the  more  placements  and  schools  the  child will  be  moved \nto,  and  the  more  harm  the  child  is  likely to  suffer. \n45.  The  Defendants  also  routinely  violate  the  due \nprocess  rights  of  foster  children  not  providing  them  a \nguardian  ad  litem or  attorney  and  by  engaging  in  ex  parte \nproceedings  with  the  dependency  court,  by  not  serving  court \npapers  on  the  child  or  the  child's  attorneys,  by  excluding  the \nchild  [and  the  child's  attorney,  if there  is  one]  from \npermanency  staffings,  by  not  moving  the  children  to  permanency \ntimely,  and  by  subjecting  foster  children  to  abuse,  neglect, \nbizarre punishments,  over-crowded,  dangerous  placements, \nseparation  from  their  siblings,  excessive  placement  and  school \nchanges,  and  an  unacceptable  high  risk  of  harm  arising  from \nthe  Defendants'  unlawful  manner  of  operating  the  Florida \nfoster  care  system. \n46.  The  Defendants  have  acknowledged  the  Adoptions  and \nSafe  Families  Act  requirement  that  children  are  not  to  remain \nin  foster  care  longer  than  12  months,  yet  have  admitted  that \nthe  vast  majority  [72.3%]  of  children  in  Florida's  foster  care \nsystem  have  been  there  longer  than  12  months  and  have \nindicated  they  are  not  complying  and  will  not  comply  with  the \n12  month  legal  limit.  Exhibit  A  sets  forth  the  percentage  of \n28 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 29 of 60\nfoster  children who  have  already been  in  care  longer  than  12 \nmonths.  Nearly  80%  of  the  more  than  6,000  Black  children  in \nfoster  care  have  been  held  by  the  Defendants  for  more  than  the \nlegally permissible  limit  of  12  months;  68%  of  the  more  than \n6,000  White  children  stuck  in  foster  care  limbo  have  been \nthere  longer  than  the  12  months  limit. \n47.  As  a  result  of  being  kept  longer  in  the  system  Lhan \nthey  should  be,  the  children  overflow  the  Defendants'  foster \nfacilities,  causing  further  overcrowding  and  greater  risk  of \nharm  and  increasing  the  likelihood of  the  abuse,  neglect  and \nfinancial  exploitation of  these  children. \n48.  As  the  result  of  their  illegally excessive  foster \ncare  confinement  with  its  associated  harm  and  devastating  lack \nof  permanence,  the  plaintiff children  have  been  harmed \nphysically  and  mentally,  are  not  developing  properly  and  are \nbeing  subjected  to  other  cruel  yet  foreseeable  abuses \ninflicted  upon  them  by  others  in  the  foster  care  system. \n49.  The  problems  of  foster  care  programs  in  Dade  County \nare  neither  new  nor  surprising.  In  1978  a  Grand  Jury  in  Dade \nCounty  looked  into  the  unacceptable  dysfunction  of  the \nDistrict  11  foster  care  system.  [Final  Report  of  the  Grand \nJury,  \"1978  Report\",  p.  29]. \n29 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 30 of 60\n50.  The  1978  Grand  Jury  found  that  36%  of  the  children \nstudied had  been  in  foster  care  for  more  than  five  years.  The \nGrand  Jury  noted  DCAF's  contention  that  large  numbers  of \nfoster  children  were  unadoptable  but  found  that  the  large \nnumber  of  children  denied  permanency  was  more  likely due  to \nthe  fact  that  DCAF's  perception  functioned  as  a  self-\nnon-aggressive  efforts  to  return  foster  children  to  their \nnatural  parents  or  place  them  in  adoptive  homes. \n51.  As  a  1989  Grand  Jury  Report  reflected  11  years \nlater,  the  situation  in  1989  [11  years  ago]  showed  no \nnoteworthy  improvement  from  the  1978  situation. \n52.  The  1978  Grand  Jury  was  troubled  by  the  apparent \ndrift  of  many  foster  children  from  home  to  home,  particularly \nthose  in  long  term  placement,  and  the  State  was  - in  1978! \ndirected  to  increase  its  efforts  to  promote  stability and \nplacement.  It did  not. \n53.  The  1989  Grand  Jury  again  deplored  the  fact  that  the \nlack  of  stability and  delay  in  termination  of  parental  rights \ncontinued.  The  1989  Grand  Jury  also  noted  the  continuing  lack \nof  good  residential  and  group  foster  homes  in  the  community, \nfinding  the  same  problems  as  the  1978  Grand  Jury. \n30 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 31 of 60\n54.  In  January  1995,  a  grand  jury  in  Palm  Beach  County \nreleased  its  report,  finding  that \nChildren  alleged  to  be  abused,  neglected  or  abandoned \nin  Palm  Beach  County  are  at  significant  risk  for \nfurther  abuse  if they  are  taken  into  the  custody  of \nthe  Department  of  Health  and  Rehabilitative  Services. \nJanuary  13,  1995  Grand  Jury  Report,  p.  1.  The  Grand  Jury  also \nre-recommended  areas  of  changes  first  urged  in  the  December \n14,  1993  report  of  the  Fifteenth  Circuit  Grand  Jury,  and  asked \nfor  a  statewide  Grand  Jury,  which  has  still not  been  convened \nby  Defendants.  Indeed,  the  only  known  statewide  quality \nassurance  review  was  conducted  in  1994,  finalized  in  1995; \nDefendants  have  provided  no  quality  control  assessment  since. \n55.  The  State  of  Florida  has  consistently  disregarded \nits  obligations  toward  the  innocent  abused  and  neglected \nvictims  who  languish,  almost  invisibly,  in  DCAF  placements. \nThe  invisibility  is  due,  at  least  in part,  to  DCAF's \nsubversion  and  misuse  of  the  confidentiality protecting \ncertain  court  records  to  protect  itself  from  scrutiny. \n56.  In  the  late  1980's,  DCAF  received  an  additional \nnearly  $2  billion  annually,  raising  the  budget  by  nearly  50% \nfrom  $4.1  billion  to  nearly  $6  billion.  In  the  early  1990's \nthe  legislature  provided more  than  another  $100  million  in \nadditional  funding  for  the  specific  purpose  of  addressing  the \ndeficiencies  in  the  foster  care  system  acknowledged  in  January \n31 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 32 of 60\n1992.  Although  the  then-Secretary  claimed  that  the  funds \nimproved  the  system by  reducing  the  foster  care  population by \n10%  since  1991,  increasing  the  number  of  case  workers  56%  and \nincreasing  the  number  of  children  successfully placed  for \nadoption,  as  of  January  1995,  there  remained  at  least  5,782 \nchildren  in  DCAF's  care  too  long,  some  50%  of  the  children  in \n''.i.nventory\"  as  of  that  time. \nToday,  although  even  more  additional  funds  have  been \nbudgeted,  9,366  children  [more  than  70%  of  all  children  in \ncare  as  of  January  2000]  have  been  held  there  too  long, \nbenefiting  only  DCAF  and  its providers.  Of  greater  concern  is \nthe  increase  in  length  of  stay numbers  despite  the  larger \nnumbers  of  children  just  coming  into  the  system,  which  influx \nhas  brought  the  average  lower  than  it would  otherwise  have \nbeen. \n57.  The  problems  faced  by  children  in  foster  care  are \nboth  epidemic  and  long-standing.  The  Defendants  have  failed \nto  discharge  their  legal  responsibilities  to  these  children. \n58.  Defendants  for  years  have  attempted  to  excuse  or \njustify the  failure  to  comply  with  the  maximum  time  limits  by \nclaiming  to  not  be  able  to  find  adequate  adoptive  homes  and \nfoster  homes.  For  thousand  of  children  Defendants  do  not  even \nlook  for  families.  This  lack  of  real  permanency  has  resulted, \n32 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 33 of 60\ninter  alia,  in  foster  children  being  deprived  of  their  rights \nto  the  opportunity  to  seek  a  healthy parent  substitute  through \nthe  adoption  process  and  to  finally  enjoy  a  healthy permanent \nhome.  Further,  if the  system  had  functioned  properly  since \nthis  administration  took  office  in  January  1998,  the  9,673 \npresent  long-termers  would  no  longer  be  DCAF  children,  but \nfamilies. \n59.  Continued  overcrowding  and  inadequately  supervised \nfoster  homes  expose  foster  children  to  the  very  real  risk  of \nsexual  and  other  abuse  and  neglect  while  they  remain  wards  of \nDCAF. \n60.  The  deficient  foster  care  conditions  and  the \nexcessive  time  spent  in  foster  care  are  known  to  the \nDefendants  but  have  not  been  addressed  properly by  the \nDefendants.  In  fact,  DCAF  has  deliberately used  a  provider-\nfocused  system,  concentrating  on  the  department,  its workers \nand  its outside  providers,  and  ignoring  state  and  federal  law \nas  to  its  obligations  to  the  children.  DCAF  and  the \nDefendants  have  also  intentionally misused  the  long  term \nfoster  care  permanency  goal  and  have  ignored  the  right  of \nchildren  to  permanent  families  outside  of  State  custody, \nkeeping  the  children  in  the  system  and  exploiting  the \n33 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 34 of 60\nchildren's  presence  to  provide  revenue  maximization  for  the \ndepartment  and  its providers. \n61.  The  Defendants  know  that  Florida's  foster  care \nsystem  discriminates  against  Black  children,  but  have  taken  no \naction  to  remedy  the  shameful  situation. \n62.  The  Defendants  know  that  the  confidentiality \nprovisions  in  state  and  federal  law  are  intended  to  protect \nthe  child  and  family,  yet  warp  and  twist  the  confidentiality \nprovision  to  protect  DCAF  and  its providers,  and  to  cover  up \nDCAF's  chronic  disregard  of  the  abuse  of  foster  children  in \nDCAF-approved  placements,  as  well  as  DCAF's  flagrant  chronic \nviolation  of  the  length  of  stay  laws  and  the  rights  of \nchildren  and  their  attorneys  to  their  own  records. \n63.  The  Defendants  know  that  their  revenue  maximization \nincreases  if a  child  is  abused  and  broken  by  the  foster  care \nsystem  to  the  point  the  child  is  eligible  for  federal \ndisability benefits,  because  the  Defendants  know  DCAF \nintercepts  such  federal  funds  and  uses  them  for  itself. \n64.  The  Defendants  know  that  Florida's  independent \nliving  system  violates  the  rights  of  disabled  children  because \nDCAF's  interception  of  a  disabled  child's  funds  precludes \ndisabled  foster  children  from  meeting  the  savings  criteria \n34 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 35 of 60\ncapriciously,  irrationally and  unfairly  insisted upon  by  DCAF \nas  a  precondition  to  being  considered  for  independent  living. \n65.  The  Defendants  know  that  the  longer  they  subject  a \nfoster  child  to  the  inhumane  conditions  that  comprise \nFlorida's  foster  care  system,  the  more  likely the  child  is  to \nbecome  a  truant  child,  then  a  delinquent  child. \nNotwithstanding  this  knowledge,  the  Defendar1t~ cunlinue  to \nexploit  Florida's  foster  children,  exposing  them  to \nunspeakable  horrors  with  no  real  families  to  provide  needed \nmoral  or  emotional  support. \n66.  To  the  extent  the  Defendants  have  wrongly  delayed  in \nproviding  services  and/or  giving  the  children  good  permanent \nhomes  because  of  any  disability or  unlawful  racial \ndiscrimination,  the  failure  constitutes  illegal  and \nimpermissible  discrimination  violative  of  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  and \n42  u.s.c.  §  12132. \n67.  Defendants'  failure  to  comply  with  the  mandatory \ntermination  requirements  of  the  controlling plan  constitutes \ngross  neglect  and  deliberate  indifference  to  their  obligations \nto  the  children whose  custody  has  been  entrusted  to  them. \n68.  The  Defendants  have  knowingly: \na)  Allowed  children  in  foster  care  to  be  placed  in \novercrowded,  inadequate  or  otherwise  unsuitable  foster \n35 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 36 of 60\nhomes; \nb)  Failed  to  properly monitor  and  supervise  the \nfoster  children  entrusted  to  them; \nc)  Intentionally  chosen  to  keep  foster  children  in \nState  custody  for  longer  than  legally allowable; \nd)  Created  excessive  caseloads  for  the  foster \ncaseworkers  by  ignoring  legal  +L-..L.: l-l-lt-::  ., L...L: .l...l...l. ...L.: L+-L->  U..... -ll  +L-l.l-.l.t :...:.   .1L t...:...:...l...1..

The  Defendants'  acts  are  such  improper  deprivations \nof  proper  shelter  and  environment  as  to  constitute  child abuse \nand  neglect.  Such  grossly  uegligent  treatment  of  the  foster \nchildren  in  question  constitutes  child  abuse  and  neglect  and \nviolates  the  Eighth  Amendment's  prohibition  of  cruel  and \nunusual  punishment  and  the  childrens'  basic  due  process  rights \nto  be  free  from  governmental  harm  under  the  Federal  and  State \nConstitutions. \n70.  By  their  culpable  negligence  and  their  failure  to \ncomply  with  Florida  law,  the  Florida  Administrative  Code  and \ntheir  failure  to  operate  the  system  consistent  with  competent \nprofessional  judgment,  the  Defendants  have  caused  Plaintiff \nclass  members  to  be  denied  their  due  process  rights  and  to  be \ndeprived  of  necessary  safe  shelter  and  have  permitted  the \ninfliction of  physical,  mental  and  psychological  injuries  to \nbe  inflicted on  members  of  the  Plaintiff  class,  contrary  to \nthe  provisions  of  section  827.04,  Florida  Statutes  and  the \nchildren's  federal  and  State  rights. \n71.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  Defendants \n37 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 38 of 60\nconduct,  Plaintiffs  have  been  deprived  by  State  action,  under \ncolor  of  State  law,  and  without  any  due  process  of  their  right \nto  be  free  from  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  and  of  their \nrights  to  the  benefits  guaranteed  to  them  under  Federal  and \nFlorida  law  and  the  Fourteenth Amendment. \n72.  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  children  in  their \ncustody with  reasonably  safe  placements,  care  that  is \nconsistent  with  competent  professional  judgment,  and  the \nprotections  afforded  to  them  by  Florida  Statutes  and  the \nFlorida Administrative  Code  have  caused  these  children  to \nsuffer  harm  which  is  often more  severe  than  that  which  caused \nthem  to  be  removed  from  the  custody  of  their  parents  and  or \ncustodians  and  which  will  leave  them  with  long-lasting \nphysical  and  emotional  wounds  more  serious  than  any  injuries \ncaused  by  their  families. \nVII.  FIRST  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF:  SUBSTANTIVE  DUE  PROCESS \nPlaintiffs  reallege  the  allegations  of  paragraph  1 \nthrough  72,  and  further  allege: \n73.  Defendants  have  denied  Plaintiffs'  right  to \nsubstantive  due  process  by,  inter  alia: \na. Detaining  non-adjudicated  children  for \nexcessive  lengths  of  time  in  emergency  shelter  status \n38 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 39 of 60\nin  an  attempt  to  convince  non-abusive,  non-neglectful \nparents  to  falsely  stipulate  to  a  dependency \nadjudication. \nb. Providing  a  foster  care  environment  not \nconsistent  with  competent  professional  judgment; \nc. Failing  to  comply  with  the  State  plan  for \npermanency  following  12  months  of  foster  care; \nd. Unreasonably  restraining  Plaintiffs  liberty by \nkeeping  them  isolated  from  their  siblings  and  a \npermanent  environment; \ne. Causing  their  emotional  conditions  to  worsen  by \nignoring  the  maximum  12  months  time  limit  on  the  amount \nof  time  a  child  can  be  kept  in  foster  care,  thereby \nfurther  overcrowding  facilities  and  overloading  the \ncase  workers  assigned; \nf. Denying  the  children  the  permanence  of  safe \nnatural  or  adoptive  families  in  violation  of  the \nchildren's  right  to  be  properly  and  safely parented; \ng. Subjecting  the  children  to  excessive  medication \nand  placements  other  than  the  least  restrictive \nplacement,  constituting  inappropriate  invasive  control \ntactics  violative  of  the  children's  rights; \nh. By  holding  non-dependent  children  in  emergency \n39 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Do)c ument 1   Entered on FLSD Docket )0 6/14/2000   Page 40 of 60\nshelters  for  more  than  30  days,  causing  harm  and \ndeterioration. \ni. By  ignoring  the  clear  intent  of  Congress  and \nFlorida's  legislature  that  no  child  spend more  than  12 \nmonths  in  foster  care  and  by  not  aggressively  and \ndiligently pursuing  proper  reunification  efforts  with \nthose  parents  with  whom  the  children  could be  bctfely \nreunified,  and  not  promptly  pursuing  good  adoptive \nplacements,  the  Defendants'  gross  neglect  has \npredictably  resulted  in  these  children  failing  to \nthrive  and  has  subjected  them  to  unacceptable  and \nimproper  psychological  pressure  and,  in  far  too  many \ninstances,  physical  abuse. \nj. The  Defendants  have  wrongly  interfered with  the \nchildren's  guaranteed  access  to  education  and  fail  to \nprovide  for  the  proper  education  of  the  children \nretained  in  foster  care,  acting  in  gross  disregard  of \nthe  children's  rights  under  federal  and  state  law  to  a \nproper. \nk. Retaining  Plaintiffs  in  foster  care  under  the \ncircumstances  existing  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment  contrary  to  the  provision  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution. \n40 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 41 of 60\n)  ) \n1. By  ignoring  the  12  month  time  limit  imposed  by \nfederal  and  Florida  law,  the  Defendants  have \nessentially  imprisoned  the  Plaintiffs  and  kept  them \nfrom  having  the  liberty necessary  to  enjoy  a  normal \nchildhood,  with  a  permanent,  stable  healthy \nenvironment. \nm.  By  illegally discriminating  on  the  basis  of \nethnic  and  racial  background. \nn. By  operating  the  foster  care  system  for  the \nfinancial  benefit  of  DCAF  and  its providers  while \nabusing  and  neglecting  the  children,  contributing  to \ntheir  dependency  and,  in  some  cases,  to  their \ndelinquency. \n74.  Defendants'  policies,  practices,  acts  and \nomissions  in  operating  Florida's  foster  care  program \nconstitute  a  failure  to  provide  Plaintiffs  with  reasonably \nsafe  placements  and  protection  from  harm  while  in  state \ncustody  in  violation  of  the  due  process  clause  of  the \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States. \n75.  Defendants'  policies,  practices,  acts  and  omissions \nin  operating  Florida's  foster  care  program  constitute  failure \nto  provide  Plaintiffs  with  care  that  is  consistent  with \ncompetent  professional.judgment  in  violation  of  the  due \n41 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 42 of 60\nprocess  clause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  Constitution \nof  the  United  States. \nWHEREFORE  Plaintiffs  seek  the  relief  set  forth  herein. \nVIII.  SECOND  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF:  PROCEDURAL  DUE  PROCESS \nPlaintiffs  reallege  the  allegations  of  paragraphs  1 \nthrough  72  and  further  allege: \n76.  Defendants'  policies,  practices,  acts  and \nomissions  in  operating  Florida's  shelter  and  foster  care \nprograms,  in  contravention  of  the  Florida  statutory  and \nregulatory  scheme  which  mandates  that  officials  follow \nguidelines  and  take  affirmative  actions  to  ensure  the  welfare \nand  well-being  of  children  in  foster  care,  deprives  Plaintiffs \nof  their  liberty  interest  in  personal  safety  in  violation  of \nthe  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the \nConstitution  of  the  United  States. \nWHEREFORE  Plaintiffs  seek  the  relief  requested  herein. \nVIIII.  THIRD  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF:  EQUAL  PROTECTION \nPlaintiffs  reallege  paragraphs  numbered  1  through  72 \nand  further  allege: \n42 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 43 of 60\n)  ) \n77.  As  clearly  reflected  in  Exhibit  A,  the  Defendants \ntreat  Black  children  differently  than  other  children  in  every \naspect  of  Florida's  foster  care  system. \n78.  As  a  result  of  the  Defendants'  actions  in  not \nproperly  operating  the  foster  care  system,  the  Defendants  are \nillegally treating  children  of  color  as  second  class  citizens \nand  denying  these  children  the  protection of  the  laws  to  which \nthey  are  entitled. \nWHEREFORE  Plaintiffs  seek  the  relief  requested  herein. \nREMEDY  AT  LAW  INADEQUATE \n79.  Each  day  that  the  Defendants  delay  their  compliance \nwith  the  controlling  law,  foster  children  are  damaged.  There \nis  no  plain,  adequate  or  complete  remedy  at  law.  Plaintiffs \nwill  continue  to  be  irreparably  injured by  the  Defendants' \npolicies,  practices,  acts  and  omissions  until  and  unless  this \nCourt  grants  the  injunctive  relief  requested. \n80.  With  each  day  that  Defendants  delay  their  compliance \nwith  the  law,  continue  their  unlawful  custody  of  members  of \nthe  Plaintiff  class,  and  continue  confining  Plaintiffs  in \ninadequate,  temporary,  unstable  foster  homes,  Plaintiffs  are \nbeing  harmed  and  losing  valuable  rights  for  which  there  is  no \nadequate  remedy  at  law  for  damages  and  can  only  request  this \n43 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2000   Page 44 of 60\n)  ) \nCourt  to  immediately  order  the  Defendants  to  stop  their \nunlawful  activity  and  to  immediately begin  complying  with  the \nprovisions  of  federal  and  Florida  laws. \nRELIEF  REQUESTED \nPlaintiffs  request  that  the  Court  order  that  this \naction be  maintained  as  a  class  action  pursuant  to  Rule  23, \nFederal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. \nPlaintiffs  request  the  Court  to  declare  unlawful  the \nDefendants'  policies  and  practices  of  ignoring  federal  and \nFlorida  laws  and  the  Florida  foster  care  plan  with  the  result \nof  denying  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff  class  the  benefits  to \nwhich  they  are  entitled under  the  plan. \nPlaintiffs  further  request  the  Court  to  provide \ntemporary  injunctive  relief  and  a  permanent  injunction \nrequiring  the  Defendants  to  operate  the  foster  care  system  in \naccordance  with  the  laws  in  effect,  and  the  procedural  and \nsubstantive  due  process  and  equal  protection  rights  of  the \nchildren.  The  injunction  should: \nA.

Require  the  Defendants  to  immediately  cease \nthe  excessive  medication  of  children  being  held by \nthem  in  foster  care  and  to  reevaluate  the \nappropriateness  of  forcing  children  to  take  mind-or \nbehavior-altering  drugs  rather  than  providing  them \nwith  the  permanent,  nurturing  families  the  children \nare  entitled  to. \nD.  Whenever  possible,  require  the  Defendants  to \nstop  changing  the  children's  house  placements  from \none  school's  boundary  area  to  another  when  the  child \nhas  adjusted  to  the  school  and  is  learning. \nE.

INTRODUCTORY  STATEMENT \n1. Plaintiffs,  Foster  Children,  on  behalf  of  themselves \nand  all  other  children  in  Florida  foster  care,  sue  Defendants \nJeb  Bush,  as  Governor  of  the  State  of  Florida;  Kathleen \nKearney,  as  Secretary of  the  Florida  Department  of  Children \nand  Families  [DCAF];  and  Chuck  Bates,  John  Awad,  Ester  Tibbs, \nLee  Johnson,  Lynn  Richard,  Don  Dixon,  Robert  Morin,  Fran \nGibbons,  Paul  Brown,  Charles  Auslander,  Christine  Davenport, \nPatrick  Howard,  Sue  Gray  and  Vern  Martin,  each  as  a  DCAF \nDistrict Administrator.  [In  this  paragraph  and  hereafter,  the \nterms  childn  and  \"foster  care\"  are  used  to  include \n~foster \nchildren  in  Defendants'  custody  based  on  either  an  allegation \nor  an  adjudication  that  the  child  is  abused,  neglected, \nabandoned,  surrendered  or  voluntarily placed with  Defendants, \nand  specifically  includes  foster  care,  shelter  care, \nindependent  living  and  pre-adoptive  and  adoptive  placements]. \nPlaintiffs  allege: \n2. This  is  an  action  for  declaratory  and  injunctive \nrelief,  brought  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  for  redress  from \nDefendants'  acts  and  omissions  in  violation  of  the  Due  Process \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution;  the  First  and  Ninth Amendments  to  the  United \nStates  Constitution;  provisions  of  the  Adoption  and  Safe \nFamilies  Act;  the  Early,  Periodic  Screening,  Diagnosis  and \nTreatment  (\"EPSDT\")  provisions  of  the  Medicaid  Title  of  the \n2 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 3 of 116\nfederal  Social  Security Act;  and  Title VI  of  the  1964  Civil \nRights  Act. \n3. This  suit  challenges  Defendants'  pattern  and \npractice  of  failing  to  fulfill  the  federal  constitutional  and \nstatutory  obligations  they  owe  to  the  children  in  Florida \nfoster  care  as  well  as  the  children's  need  for  a  safe,  stable \nand  appropriate  placement.  This  suit  also  challenges \nDefendants'  deliberate  indifference  to  the  existence  of  such \npattern  and  practice;  to  the  children's  need  for  safe,  stable \nand  appropriate  placements;  to  the  children's  health  and  well \nbeing;  and  to  the  harm  Defendants  thereby  cause  these \nexceptionally vulnerable  children.  Plaintiffs,  on  behalf  of \nthemselves  and  all  other  similarly  situated  children,  seek \ninjunctive  and  declaratory  relief  from  such  unconstitutional \nand  otherwise  illegal  practices. \nB.  JURISDICTION \n4. Because  this  is  an  action  in which  the  matter  in \ncontroversy  arises  under  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the \nUnited  States,  this  Court  has  jurisdiction over  this  matter \npursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§  1331  and  1343(3). \nC.  PLAINTIFFS \n1.  Bonnie \n5. Plaintiff Bonnie  L.  has  been  involved with  Florida's \nfoster  care  system  since  1986,  when  she  was  two  years  of  age. \nHer  father's  parental  rights  were  terminated  in  1987;  her \n3 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 4 of 116\nmother  was  having  trouble  making  ends  meet  as  a  recently \ndivorced  single  parent  with  few  job  skills.  Instead  of \nproviding  services  to  the  child's mother,  DCAF  convinced  the \nmother  to  surrender  the  Plaintiff and  her  older  sister  J.L.  so \nthey  could  be  adopted  and  have  a  ~better life.\"  [Plaintiffs' \nsister  J.L.  has  reached  her  majority  and  has  left  Defendants' \ncustody] . \n6. Bonnie's  adoptive  parents,  who  also  cared  for  her \nsister and  whom  DCAF  handpicked  to  care  for  these  children, \nwere  abusive  beyond  imagination.  The  girls  were  subjected  to \ninnumerable  beatings  and  other  torture,  including being  tied \nto  the  bed  by  their wrists  and  ankles,  being  made  to  sleep  on \nconcrete  surrounded by  a  brick  cage  at  night,  and  punished  if \nthe  two  girls  spoke  to  each  other  or  anyone  else.  DCAF's \nreceived  several  calls  reporting  the  abuses, \n~Hotline\" \nincluding  calls  in  1990,  1993,  1994  and  1997,  before \nDefendants  finally  took  the  girls  back  into  foster  care  in \nMarch  1997  after  a  total  of  ten  years  of  what  DCAF  itself \ncalled  egregious  abuse.  Since  then,  DCAF  chose  not  even  to \nattempt  to  seek  a  permanent  family  for  the  girls,  moving  them \nfrom  one  unsuitable  placement  to  another. \n7. In  1999,  a  guardian  ad  litem  located  the  girls' \nnatural  mother  who  asked  to  adopt  her  biological  daughters, \nBonnie  and  her  sister.  Although  DCAF  had  no  other  options  (and \nwas  not  even  looking  for  an  adoptive  placement  for  the  girls), \n4 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 5 of 116\nDCAF  initially objected  to  either  of  the  girls  even  having \ncontact  with  their biological mother. \n8. For  more  than  three  years,  Defendants  effectively \nhad  given  up  on  achieving  permanency  for  these  girls  and \nexpected  them  to  remain  in  foster  care  until  they  reached \ntheir majority.  Recently,  Defendants  finally  acquiesced  to \nthe  biological  mother's  adoption  of  Bonnie,  but  the  adoption \nis  not  final.  Until  it is  final,  this  child  remains  in  foster \ncare. \n9. Plaintiff Bonnie  L.  has  suffered  and  continues  to \nsuffer  irreparable  harm  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to \nprotect  her  from  harm  and  to  provide  her  expeditiously with  a \npermanent,  legally  stable  family.  Both  the  adoption  and  the \nchild's placement  with  her  biological  mother  could  easily \ndisrupt,  which  would  require  Defendants  to  select  another \nplacement  for  Bonnie.  Defendants'  continuing  custody  of  and \ncontrol  over  Bonnie,  together  with  their  pattern  and  practice \nof  operating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional  and  otherwise  illegal manner,  create  a  real \nand  substantial  threat  that  this  child will  be  subjected  to \nfurther  harm  in  addition  to  that  which  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  her.  Plaintiff  Bonnie  L.  brings  this  action \nthrough  her  next  friend  Donald  Hadsock. \n5 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 6 of 116\n2.  Rebecca  and  Reggie  B. \n10.  Plaintiffs  Reggie  B.  and  Rebecca  B.  are  13-year-old \ntwins  who  reside  in  District  9.  They  entered  Defendants' \ncustody  and  were  placed  in  a  shelter  on  May  4,  1997  and  were \nadjudicated  dependent  on  June  1,  1998.  Suitable  relative \ncaretakers  in  other  states were  not  contacted  until  very \nrecently. \n11.  Reggie  and  Rebecca  were  separated  for  a  while  in \nfoster  care.  For  one  month,  Reggie  was  sent  to  a  group  home  to \ndevelop  \"social  skills.\"  His  therapist,  teachers,  former \nfoster  mother  and  DCAF  caseworker  all  agree  that  something \nmajor  happened  at  the  group  home  that  caused  the  child  to \ndeteriorate  drastically.  He  was  returned  to  his  previous \novercrowded  foster  home  but  continued  to  deteriorate \nemotionally,  eventually  killing  a  puppy.  After  he  was  asked  to \nleave  this  foster  home,  he  spent  weeks  moving  from  one  shelter \nto  another,  from  one  foster  home  to  another,  usually  a \ndifferent  place  each  night.  He  left one  home  and  hitchhiked \nback  to  the  DCAF  offices  after  dark.  He  has  developed  such \nsignificant  emotional  problems  while  in  care  that  he  is  now  in \n' \na  therapeutic  group  home. \n12.  Defendants  have  only  recently  approached  an  aunt  of \nReggie  and  Rebecca,  who  lives  out  of  state,  to  be  a  placement \nresource  for  them.  Although,  on  information  and  belief,  she \nhelped  rear  the  children while  their mother  was  alive  and \n6 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 7 of 116\nbefore  they  entered  Defendants'  custody,  no  prior  request  was \nmade  for  her  to  care  for  these  children.  A  horne  study  of  this \naunt  is  now  under  way  pursuant  to  the  interstate  compact  for \nchild placement,  but  only  for  Rebecca.  If  Defendants  had \npreviously  identified  this  relative  and  placed  Reggie  and \nRebecca  with  her,  Reggie  would  have  been  spared  the \ndevastating  harm  he  suffered  in  the  group  horne.  This,  in  turn, \nwould  have  eliminated  even  the  possibility  that  he  would \nsuffer  the  debilitating number  of  replacements  he  has  endured \nor  that  he  would  be  subjected  to  the  night-to-night  circuit. \nIt would  also  have  expedited  the  placement  of  Rebecca  - and \nmade  it possible  for  Reggie  to  be  placed  - with  a  permanent \nfamily. \n13.  Following  his  experience  in  Defendants'  custody, \nReggie  now  has  such  severe  emotional  problems  that  the  aunt  is \nunable  to  care  for  him.  The  twins  are  currently separated  and \nare  likely  to  remain  so.  This  separation  would  not  have  been \nnecessary  had  the  children  been  provided  adequate  and  safe \ncare  from  the  outset  of  their placement  with  Defendants. \n14.  Reggie  also  has  a  cleft  palate  and  other  medical \nneeds  which  Defendants  have  failed  to  address.  The  Children's \nMedical  Services  reports  several  missed  appointments,  which \nhave  caused  him  to  \"fall  through  the  cracks\"  at  the  cllnic. \n15.  Reggie  and  Rebecca  continue  to  be  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  Thus,  Defendants  continue  to  control  where  the  twins \n7 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 8 of 116\nare  placed or  if they  are  to  be  moved.  The  planned  relative \nplacement  for  Rebecca  could  easily disrupt  prior  to  or \npossibly  even  after  the  child  is  moved,  and  Reggie's  current \nplacement  in  a  therapeutic  setting  could  end  at  any  time. \nEither  circumstance  would  require  Defendants  to  place  the \nchildren  in  a  new  foster  home  or  facility. \n16.  Reggie  and  Rebecca  have  suffered  and  continue  to \nsuffer  serious  and  irreparable  harm  as  a  result  of  Defendants' \nfailure  to  protect  them  from  harm,  to  ensure  that  Reggie  has \nthe  medical  care  he  needs,  to  provide  a  stable  living \nenvironment  that  is  adequate  to  both  children's  needs,  and  to \nachieve  permanency  expeditiously  for  these  children,  which \ncould  have  been  accomplished  by  Defendants'  earlier \nidentification  of  the  aunt  as  a  placement  resource.  As  a \nresult  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  operating  the \nFlorida  foster  care  system  in  an  unconstitutional  and \notherwise  illegal manner,  Reggie  and  Rebecca  will  continue  to \nbe  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being  subjected  to  the \ntypes  of  harm  Defendants  have  already  inflicted on  them  as \nlong  as  they  remain  in  Defendants'  custody.  They  bring  this \naction  through  their  next  friend  Danielle  Roussel. \n3.  Laurie  and  Lillie S. \n17.  Plaintiffs  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.  are  two  Black \nfoster  children who  are  sisters  and  are  in  the  Defendants' \ncustody  in  Palm  Beach  County.  Born  in  1991  and  1993 \n8 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 9 of 116\nrespectively,  the  girls  entered  Defendants'  custody  on \nDecember  19,  1994  and  remain  in  foster  care  today. \n18.  Laurie  and  Lillie  have  several  siblings  in  foster \ncare  with  whom  they  were  not  placed,  and  they  were  not \nprovided  with  sibling  visitation.  It was  not  necessary  for \nDefendants  to  separate  Laurie  and  Lillie  from  their  siblings, \nor  to  deny  them  sibling visitation,  in  order  to  protect  the \nhealth,  safety or  welfare  of  any  of  the  children,  and  a \nprofessional  competent  to  make  such  a  judgment  has  never \ndetermined  that  placement  together  or  regular  and  frequent \nvisitation would  be  detrimental  to  any  of  them.  Instead,  these \nsiblings  were  separated  from  each  other  because  Defendants \nfailed  to  recruit  a  sufficient  number  of  foster  homes  for \nlarge  siblings  groups,  and  failed  to  arrange  for  visits \nbetween  the  separately placed  children.  This  racially  neutral \nmethod  of  administration  has  a  disparate  impact  on  Black \n' \nsiblings  in  foster  care,  making  sibling  separation more  likely \nfor  Black  foster  children  than  for  White  foster  children;  has \nhad  the  effect  of  discriminating  against  Laurie  and  Lillie  and \nother  Black  foster  children  on  the  basis  of  their  race  or \ncolor;  and  has  had  the  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \nimpairing  the  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  Defendants' \nprovision  of  foster  care  to  Laurie,  Lillie,  and  other  Black \nchildren  in  Defendants'  custody. \n9 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 10 of 116\n19.  The  parental  rights  of  the  children's  mother  were \nterminated  in March  of  1997.  The  father's  rights  were  not \nterminated  until  May  1999. \n20.  DCAF  did  not  perform  a  proper,  diligent  search  to \nlocate  suitable  caretakers  for  Laurie  and  Lillie.  Instead, \nDCAF  placed  the  girls  in  an  inappropriate  foster  home  that  has \nbeen  the  subject  of  numerous  investigations  and  is  known  for \nhousing  teenage  girls who  engage  in  casual  and  frequent  sexual \nconduct.  DCAF  ignored  complaints  about  the  placement  and  kept \nLaurie  and  Lillie  there  for  years. \n21.  The  foster  mother  initially wished  to  adopt  Laurie \nand  Lillie,  and,  despite  the  problems  with  the  foster  home, \nthe  children  bonded  to  her  and  called her  \"grandma\".  However, \nLillie began  acting  out  sexually  at  school  when  she  was  six \nyears  old.  When  the  DCAF  adoption  worker  requested  that  the \nfoster  mother  work  on  issues  involving  her  home  and  parenting, \nthe  foster  mother  requested  and  obtained  the  immediate  removal \nof  the  children. \n22.  The  sudden move  from  the  home  where  they  had  lived \nfor  the  previous  five  years  was  traumatic  for  Laurie  and \nLillie.  Their  mental  and  emotional  health  began  to  deteriorate \nseverely,  and  Lillie,  at  only  seven  years  of  age,  expressed \nthe  wish  to  die.  She  was  involuntarily  committed  to  a  mental \nhealth  crisis  unit. \n10 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 11 of 116\n23.  DCAF  has  now  located  an  uncle  of  Laurie  and  Lillie, \nwho  lives  out  of  state  and  wishes  to  adopt  the  girls.  This \nsame  uncle  informed  Defendants  he  was  willing  to  adopt  the \ngirls when  they  were  initially removed  in  1994,  but  was  told \nby  DCAF  that  relatives  could  not  adopt.  Placement  with  this \nuncle  in  1994  would  have  significantly  increased  Laurie's  and \nLillie's  opportunity  for  permanency  and  concomitantly \ndecreased  the  chance  they would  have  been  exposed  either  to  a \ndamaging  environment  such  as  that  provided  by  their  pre \nadoptive  horne  or  the  trauma  of  being  uprooted. \n24.  Defendants'  failure  to  achieve  a  permanent  family \nfor  Laurie  and  Lillie more  expeditiously  resulted  from \nDefendants'  practice  of  treating  Black  and  White  foster \nchildren  differently based  on  their  race  or  color  and  is  also \ndue  to  Defendants'  practice  of  making  even  less  effort  to \nprovide  services  and  develop  and  obtain  appropriate  foster  and \nadoptive  placements  for  Black  foster  children  than  for  White \nchildren  in  Defendants'  custody. \n25.  Defendants'  failure  to  develop  and  maintain  a \nsufficient  number  of  appropriate  and  safe  foster  homes  and  to \ntimely  identify  relatives  who  are  able  and  willing  to  care  for \nchildren  in  foster  care  decreases  the  children's  chance  to \nhave  a  permanent,  loving  horne.  These  racially neutral \npractices  have  a  disparate  impact  on  Black  foster  children, \nhave  had  the  effect  of  discriminating  against  Laurie,  Lillie \n11 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 12 of 116\nand  other  Black  foster  children  on  the  basis  of  their  race  or \ncolor,  and  have  had  the  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \nimpairing  the  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  Defendants' \nprovision  of  foster  care  for  these  children. \n26.  Laurie  and  Lillie  have  been  and  continue  to  be \nirreparably  and  seriously  traumatized  and  harmed  by \nDefendants'  inappropriate  handling  of  their  case,  their \nfailure  to  protect  these  children  from  harm,  and  the  several \nyears'  delay  in  being  moved  to  a  good  permanent  family.  As  a \nresult  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  operating  the \nFlorida  foster  care  system  in  an  unconstitutional,  racially \ndiscriminatory  and  otherwise  illegal manner,  Laurie  and  Lillie \nwill  continue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being \nsubjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  them  as  long  as  they  remain  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie S.  bring  this  action  through \ntheir  next  friend  Danielle  Roussel. \n4.  Leslie  F. \n27.  Plaintiff  Leslie  F.  is  in  Defendants'  custody  as  a \nfoster  child.  She  is  currently  17  years  of  age.  Leslie  is \nBlack  and  of  Haitian  descent.  She  was  freed  for  adoption  when \nshe  was  nine  years  old,  but  has  never  been  adopted  or \notherwise  provided  with  a  permanent  home.  Leslie's  former \nfoster  mother  adopted  Leslie's  biological  brother,  but  refused \n12 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 13 of 116\nto  adopt  Leslie.  She  then  cut  off  all  contact  between  Leslie \nand  her  biological  brother. \n28.  Leslie  has  endured  over  30  different  foster  care \nplacements,  and  possibly  as  many  as  50  placements.  The  child \nwas  told by  her  DCAF  foster  care  caseworker  that  DCAF  could \nnot  find  a  stable  placement  for  her  because  no  one  wants  her. \n29.  The  grossly  inappropriate  number  of  placements  to \nwhich  Defendants  subjected  Leslie  and  their  failure  to  provide \nher  with  the  services  she  needed  to  achieve  permanency, \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  placing  her  in  an  adoptive  home \nthat  would  accept  her  and  providing  supportive  services  to  her \nand  her  adoptive  family,  resulted  from  Defendants'  practice  of \ntreating Black  and  White  foster  children  differently based  on \ntheir  race  or  color.  The  remarkable  instability of  Leslie's \nplacements  and  the  failure  to  achieve  permanency  for  her  are \nalso  due  to  Defendants'  practice  of making  even  less  effort  to \nprovide  services  and  develop  and  obtain  appropriate  foster  and \nadoptive  placements  for  Black  foster  children  than  for  White \nchildren  in  Defendants'  custody.  The  system's  discrimination \nagainst  Black  children  is  long-standing;  the  Defendants  are \naware  of  a  1978  Dade  County  grand  jury  report  condemning  the \ndiscrimination  and  demanding  an  end  to  it. \n30.  Defendants'  failure  to  develop  and  maintain  a \nsufficient  number  of  appropriate  foster  and  adoptive \nplacements  increases  the  likelihood  children will  be  placed \n13 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 14 of 116\nwith  foster  parents  incapable  of  caring  for  them,  which,  in \nturn,  leads  to  disruption  and  multiple  placements.  The  lack  of \nplacements  also  decreases  the  chance  children  will  achieve \npermanency  expeditiously.  These  racially neutral  methods  of \nadministration  have  a  disparate  impact  on  Black  children,  have \nhad  the  effect  of  discriminating  against  Leslie  and  other \nBlack  foster  children  on  the  basis  of  their  race  or  color,  and \nhave  had  the  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing \nthe  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  Defendants'  provision \nof  foster  care  to  Leslie  and  other  similarly  situated \nchildren. \n31.  From  late  1998  through  early  1999,  Leslie  was  in  a \nshelter,  even  though  there  was  nothing  temporary  about \nDefendants'  custody  of  her  and  she  was  entitled to  a  stable \nplacement  where  she  would  not  suffer  further  damage  or  injury. \n32.  Eventually  in  1999,  DCAF  finally  found  a  foster \nhome  for  Leslie,  but  when  the  DCAF  foster  care  supervisor \nvisited  the  home  after  Leslie  complained  about  the  conditions \nthere,  the  supervisor  reported  the  home  for  investigation \nbecause  there  was  insufficient  food  for  the  children  placed  in \nthe  foster  home,  as  well  as  other  exhibited problems.  These \nconcerns  were  raised  with  a  DCAF  licensing  supervisor  who  is \nresponsible  for  determining  whether  foster  homes  will  be \nlicensed  and  retain  their  license  to  care  for  children  in \nDefendants'  custody.  This  DCAF  supervisor  was  asked  to  talk  to \n14 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 15 of 116\nother  children  in  the  home  to  verify  the  conditions  there,  but \nshe  refused  to  do  so,  stating  she  talks  to  the  foster  parents, \nnot  to  the  children.  This  DCAF  supervisor  also  refused  to  call \nthe  child  abuse  to  report  the  concerns  about  the \n~Hotlinen \nchildren  not  being  fed  in  the  foster  home  which,  if  true, \nwould  constitute  neglect.  Her  response  was  that  she  is  an \nadvocate  for  foster  parents  and  does  not  call  the  Hotline  to \nreport  them. \n33.  Since  leaving  the  neglectful  foster  home  in  1999, \nLeslie  has  endured  several  additional  moves  to  other  foster \ncare  placements.  She  and  other  foster  children  were  removed \nfrom  her  most  recent  foster  home  in  connection  with \nallegations  they  were  in  grave  danger  in  the  home,  and  Leslie \nwas  placed  in  a  shelter,  a  totally  inappropriate  placement  for \nher.  She  was  then  placed  in  yet  another  temporary  placement, \nfrom  which  she  ran,  but  she  intends  to  return  to  Defendants' \nphysical  custody,  and  remain  in  their  legal  custody. \n34.  As  a  result  of  her  many  moves,  Leslie's  education \nhas  been  seriously disrupted.  Although  DCAF  has  not  made \nreasonable  efforts  to  find  placements  that  would  allow  Leslie \nto  continue  to  attend  the  same  school,  she  herself  has  made \nHerculean  efforts  to  maintain  continuity  in  her  education, \noften having  to  travel  unacceptably  long  distances  to  remain \nin  the  same  school  after  Defendants  transferred  to  her  a  new \nfoster  care  placement. \n15 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 16 of 116\n35.  Leslie  has  sought  an  opportunity  to  participate  in \nthe  subsidized  Independent  Living  foster  care  program,  a \nbenefit  provided  by  the  State.  There  is  no  application  process \nfor  this  program,  and  Defendants  do  not  provide  children who \nare  excluded  from  it with  notice  of  the  decision  or  an \nopportunity  to  have  DCAF's  decision  reviewed,  and  their \ndecisions  concerning  which  children  will  participate  in  the \nprogram  are  arbitrary  and  capricious.  Thus  far,  Leslie  has  not \nbeen  included  in  the  subsidized  Independent  Living  program. \n36.  Leslie  will  turn  18  years  of  age  in  October  2000. \nShe  has  mental  health problems  and  will  not  be  prepared  to \nleave  Defendants'  custody when  she  reaches  her  majority. \nIndividuals  in  foster  care  are  permitted  to  remain  in  care \npast  their  18th  birthday  if  they meet  specified  criteria,  but \nDefendants  do  not  provide  youngsters  in  their  custody  who \nreach  their  18th  birthday with  notice  that  they  have  this \noption  or provide  such  individuals  who  are  discharged  from \ncare  with  an  opportunity  to  have  the  discharge  decision \nreviewed  before  or  after  discharge.  Defendants'  decisions \nconcerning  which  individuals  will  be  permitted  to  remain  in \ncare  after  reaching  18  years  of  age  are  arbitrary  and \ncapricious.  If  Leslie  is  discharged  from  Defendants'  custody \nwhen  she  reaches  18  years  of  age,  she  will  be  exposed  to \nimmediate  and  grave  danger  because  she  is  not  prepared  to  care \nfor  herself. \n16 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 17 of 116\n37.  Until  the  Florida  Dependency  Court  took  the  unusual \nstep  of  appointing  an  attorney  for  Leslie,  [something  which \ndoes  not  occur  for  most  children  in  dependency  proceedings], \nDefendants  had  consistently deprived  her  of  an  opportunity  to \nattend  and  participate  in  judicial  and  administrative  reviews \nthat  addressed  her  legal,  custodial  and  permanency  status. \nDefendants  have  failed  to  notify Leslie  of  the  judicial  and \nadministrative  reviews,  although  they  routinely provide  notice \nto  other  parties  concerning  these  types  of  proceedings,  the \ncourt  had  not  determined  her  attendance  at  judicial  review \nhearings  was  not  in  her  best  interests,  and  Defendants  had  not \ndetermined  she  had  insufficient  maturity  to  attend \nadministrative  reviews  of  her  case.  Defendants  have  also \nfailed  to  provide  the  services,  such  as  transportation,  that \nLeslie  needed  in  order  to  be  able  to  attend  and  participate  in \nthese  proceedings,  and  she  had  no  other  source  from  which  to \nobtain  these  services.  Additionally,  Defendants  have \narbitrarily and  capriciously prevented  Leslie  from \nparticipating  in  DCAF's  process  for  developing  a  case  plan  for \nher,  although  it would  have  been  appropriate  for  her  to \nparticipate  in  this  process.  Leslie's  case  plan  addresses, \namong  other  things,  the  appropriateness  of  retaining  her  in \nDefendants'  custody,  her  current  placement,  the  services \nprovided  to  her,  her  participation  in  an  Independent  Living \n17 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 18 of 116\nProgram,  and  other  issues  that  are  critical  to  her  well  being \nand  development. \n38.  Leslie  has  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer \nirreparable  and  very  serious  injury  as  a  result  of  Defendant's \nfailure  to  protect  her  from  harm,  to  provide  her  with  a  stable \nfoster  care  placement,  to  provide  her  with  permanency,  to \nprevent  her  separation  from  her  brother,  to  provide  her  with \nan  opportunity  to  participate  in  all  court  hearings \nadministrative  reviews  and  the  development  of  case  plans  that \naffect  her,  and  to  desist  from  their  racially discriminatory \npractices.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \noperating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional,  racially  discriminatory  and  otherwise \nillegal manner,  Leslie  will  continue  to  be  at  substantial  and \nimminent  risk  of  being  subjected  to  the  types  of  harm \nDefendants  have  already  inflicted on  her  as  long  as  she \nremains  in  Defendants'  custody.  Leslie  is  also  at  imminent  and \nvery  real  risk of  being  denied  participation  in  the  subsidized \nIndependent  Living  Program  and  discharged  from  Defendants' \ncustody,  without  notice  or  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing  to \ncontest  either decision.  Leslie  F.  brings  this  action  through \nher  next  friend  Brenda  Shapiro. \n5.  Sandra  M. \n39.  District  9  Plaintiff Sandra  M.  is  a  16-year-old who \nwas  sexually  abused  and  neglected while  living  at  home  and, \n18 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 19 of 116\nafter  six  reports  of  suspected maltreatment,  was  removed  from \nher  mother  and  placed  in  foster  care  in  1989.  Sandra  and  her \nbrother  were  placed  in  one  foster  home  for  two  years,  where \nthey  bonded  to  their  good,  loving  foster  parents.  When  the \nnatural  parents'  rights  were  terminated  and  the  children \nbecame  available  for  adoption,  Defendants,  for  no  legitimate \nreason,  denied  the  children's  foster  parents'  request  to  adopt \nthe  children. \n40.  DCAF  instead separated Sandra  from  her  brother,  and \nboth  children  continued  to  be  held  in  foster  care  limbo. \nSandra  was  placed  in  several  different  foster  homes  over  the \nnext  two  years,  while  she  was  separated  from  her  brother.  She \nwas  eventually placed with  a  foster  parent  (foster  parent  \"A\") \nwho  offered  Sandra  stability. \n41.  Against  the  advice  of  Sandra's  guardian  ad  litem, \nDefendants  then  moved  Sandra  from  A's  foster  home  to  an \nadoptive  home  with  her  brother  and  an  older  sister.  By  this \ntime,  Sandra  and  her  siblings  were  displaying  such  disturbed \nbehavior  that  this  adoptive  placement  lasted  only  six  months, \nand  Sandra  was  moved  back  to  foster  parent  A,  being  separated \nfrom  her  siblings  for  the  last  time.  At  this  time  Sandra  was \neight  years  old  and  foster  parent  A  decided  to  adopt  her. \nThere  were  obvious  problems  with  this  mother's  parenting \nskills,  which  were  well  known  to  DCAF,  and  Sandra  did  not \nappear  to  be  happy  during  her  foster  placement  in  the  home, \n19 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 20 of 116\nwhich  boded  ill  for  a  successful  adoption.  DCAF  pursued  this \nadoption,  which  was  finalized,  but  subsequently  failed. \n42.  The  adoptive  mother  could  not  handle  Sandra,  who \ncontinued  to  exhibit  disturbed  behavior.  The  adoptive  mother \nplaced  her  at  the  Nelle  Smith  Group  Home,  and  on  July  2,  1997, \nDefendants  retook  custody  of  Sandra.  In  the  same  month,  the \nNelle  Smith  Group  Home  closed,  and  Defendants  placed  Sandra  at \nthe  White  Foundation  shelter,  where  she  was  attacked  and \nbeaten  by  two  female  residents  on  July  15,  1997.  Due  to \nDefendants'  failure  to  care  for  her  and  to  provide  her  with  a \nsafe  placement,  Sandra  returned  to  her  adoptive  mother.  But \nher  adoptive  mother  was  still unable  to  maintain  Sandra  due  to \nthe  child's  behavior,  and  she  placed  her  back  in  foster  care \nas  of  October  8,  1997. \n43.  After  Sandra  returned  to  foster  care  in  Fall  1997, \nDefendants  placed  her  in  several  foster  homes  until  1998,  when \nshe  was  placed  at  the  South  County  Mental  Health  Center's \nGroup  Home,  where  she  did well.  But  that  facility,  like  the \nNelle  Smith  Group  Home,  closed,  and,  because  Defendants  said \nthey  had  nowhere  else  to  place  her,  they  placed  Sandra  at  the \ncrisis  unit  at  South  County  Mental  Health  Center  in April \n1998.  She  remained  there  for  one  year,  rather  than  the  short \n(normally  72-hour)  period  for  which  placement  there  is \ndesigned.  Finally,  in May  1999,  she  was  placed  at  the \nAdolescent  Residential  Learning  Center  at  the  45th  Street \n20 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 21 of 116\nMental  Health  Center,  a  residential  psychiatric  setting.  She \nwas  then  \"stepped  down\"  to  daniel  memorial  therapeutic  group \nhome  in  December  1999,  where  she  remains. \n44.  Defendants  have  never  moved  to  terminate  the \nparental  rights  of  Sandra's  adoptive  parent;  Sandra  remains  in \nDefendants'  custody  as  a  foster  child;  and  Defendants' \nintention  is  for  her  to  remain  in  foster  care  until  she \nreaches  her  majority.  Effectively,  Defendants  have  abandoned \nany  attempt  to  find  a  permanent  home  for  Sandra. \n45.  Sandra  has  been  and  continues  to  be  seriously  and \nirreparably harmed  by  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  her  with \na  safe  and  stable  foster  care  placement  or  an  appropriate  and \nstable  permanent  family.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern \nand  practice  of  operating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional  and  otherwise  illegal manner,  Sandra  will \ncontinue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being \nsubjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  her  as  long  as  she  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  She  brings  this  action  through  her  guardian  ad  litem \nDanielle  Roussel. \n6.  Tanya  M. \n46.  Plaintiff  Tanya  M.  is  a  14-year-old  foster  child \nwho  was  first  placed  in  foster  care  on  August  31,  1998. \nDistrict  9  DCAF  has  placed  her  in  several  different  unsuitable \nplacements  including  foster  homes  where  she  has  been  neglected \n21 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 22 of 116\nand  subjected  to  cruel  and  dangerous  treatment.  In  one  home, \nshe  was  not  adequately  fed  and  lost  a  significant  amount  of \nweight  within  one  month.  Tanya  was  thin  to  start with,  and \nthis  weight  loss  was  unnecessary  and  harmful.  Her  complaints \nto  her  DCAF  worker  about  this  foster  home  were  ignored.  In  her \nnext  foster  home,  she  was  one  of  eight  children.  All  eight \nchildren  slept  in  one  bedroom  and  shared  one  dresser. \n47.  Tanya's  need  to  be  placed  in  an  appropriate  foster \nhome  was  ignored,  and  DCAF  left her  at  another  overcrowded \nhome  where  she  had  previously been  placed,  even  though  the \nfoster  mother  had  already  warned  DCAF  the  child was  not \nacceptable  for  placement  there.  Despite  this  warning,  the  DCAF \nworker  left Tanya  at  this  foster  home  after  the  DCAF  office \nhad  closed.  The  foster  mother  made  it clear  she  did  not  want \nTanya  there,  and  as  a  result,  Tanya  left  the  foster  home, \nalthough  she  had  no  place  to  go.  Later  that  night,  a  Pahokee \nPolice  Department  officer who  was  concerned  that  it was  unsafe \nfor  her  to  be  walking  alone  in  the  area  after  dark  picked  up \nTanya.  At  the  time,  she  was  carrying  all  of  her  possessions  in \nbags  and  a  backpack. \n48.  Subsequently,  an  appropriate  home  was  located  and \nTanya  began  to  thrive  in  her  new  environment;  she  began  to  do \nwell  in  school,  also.  She  was  subsequently  returned  to  her \nbiological  parents  on  October  18,  1999,  after  more  than  12 \nmonths  in  the  foster  care  system. \n22 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 23 of 116\n49.  The  reunification with  her  parents  failed.  After \nless  than  two  months,  on  December  5,  1999,  Tanya  was  assaulted \nby  her  father  and  sustained  a  broken  arm.  Tanya  was  placed  in \na  DCAF  shelter  and  then  returned  to  foster  care  on  May  1, \n2000. \n50.  Both  times  Tanya  was  removed  from  her  biological \nfamily's  horne  (in  1998  and  2000),  her  three  younger  siblings \nwere  removed  simultaneously.  Tanya,  however,  has  never  been \nplaced with  her  siblings,  although  placement  together  would \nnot  be  contrary  to  the  health,  safety or  welfare  of  any  of  the \nchildren.  No  professional  qualified by  the  training, \ncredentials  and  experience  needed  to  make  a  sibling-separation \ndecision  has  ever  found  that  a  joint  placement  would  be \ndetrimental  to  any  of  the  children. \n51.  Tanya  was  placed  in  an  overcrowded  girls'  group \nshelter.  DCAF  has  stated  that  it wants  to  place  Tanya  at  a \nwilderness  camp,  which  is primarily  used  as  a  moderate  risk \ndelinquency  commitment  program,  even  though  Tanya  is  not  a \ndelinquent  and  has  not  committed  any  violations  of  the  law. \nTanya  remains  in  Defendants'  legal  custody  as  a  foster  child. \nAs  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  minimally \nadequate  care  and  supervision  of  Tanya,  she  has  run  away  from \nthe  shelter,  and  her  whereabouts  are  not  known,  subjecting  her \nto  grave  danger. \n23 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 24 of 116\n52.  Tanya  has  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer \nirreparable  and  very  serious  injury  as  a  result  of  Defendants' \nfailure  to  protect  her  from  harm  and  provide  her  with  a \nsecure,  safe  and  appropriate  placement.  As  a  result  of \nDefendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  operating  the  Florida \nfoster  care  system  in  an  unconstitutional  and  otherwise \nillegal manner,  Tanya  will  continue  to  be  at  substantial  and \nimminent  risk  of  being  subjected  to  the  types  of  harm \nDefendants  have  already  inflicted on  her  as  long  as  she \nremains  in  Defendants'  custody.  She  brings  this  action  through \nDanielle  Roussel. \n7.  Jay  and  Candice  D. \n53.  Plaintiffs  Jay  D.  and  Candice  D.  are  brother  and \nsister,  born  on  August  28,  1992  and  May  6,  1991,  respectively. \nThey  were  placed  in  foster  care  on  February  15,  1996,  and  have \nlived  continuously  in  foster  care  since  that  date.  They  remain \nin  Defendants'  custody.  Parental  rights  were  terminated  with \nrespect  to  these  children  on  June  17,  1998. \n54.  Jay  and  Candice  have  resided  in  a  stable  home-like \nenvironment  at  the  Real  Life  Children's  Ranch  since  April  30, \n1997.  Candice  has  lived with  the  same  group-home  parents  for \nher  entire  placement  at  the  Real  Life  Ranch,  and  Jay  has  lived \nwith  his  same  group-home  parents  since  September  1998.  The \nchildren  are  bonded  to  their  house  parents,  attend  community \nschools,  and  are  part  of  their  group-home  families;  both \n24 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 25 of 116\nfamilies  want  to  adopt  the  D.  children  who  currently  resides \nwith  them  and  have  placed  adoption  bids  for  the  children. \n55.  For  some  time  Jay's  and  Candice's  older  brother  was \nalso  placed  at  the  Real  Life  Ranch.  The  younger  children  had \nbeen  separated  from  him  earlier because  of  his  aggressive \nbehavior,  and  he  was  subsequently  discharged  from  the  Real \nLife  Ranch  on  July  22,  1999,  because  of  allegations  of \ninappropriate  sexual  behavior  toward  his  siblings.  The  elder \nbrother  was  subsequently  rejected  by  a  prospective  foster  horne \nbased  on  the  perceived  danger  he  posed  to  the  family's \nbiological  son,  and  he  was  eventually placed  in  a  facility \nwith  his  own  alarmed  room.  This  placement  also  failed  because \nof  his  aggression  toward  the  younger  children  also  in  the \nfacility. \n56.  Jay  and  Candice,  who  had  exhibited  problematic \nbehaviors  while  their  elder  sibling was  at  the  Real  Life \nRanch,  have  achieved  far  more  stable  and  acceptable  behavior \npatterns  since  his  removal  and  they  are  doing  remarkably  well \nin  their  placement.  The  children's  therapist,  as  well  as  the \nstaff  at  the  Real  Life  Ranch,  have  indicated  their  belief  that \nJay's  and  Candice's  behavior  has  stabilized because  their \nelder  brother  was  removed  from  their  living  environment,  which \nresulted  in  the  children  developing  an  increased  sense  of \nsecurity. \n25 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 26 of 116\n57.  Between  April  1997  and  February  2000,  Jay  and \nCandice  had  only  three  visits  from  a  DCAF  caseworker.  The \ndecision  to  deny  them  caseworker  oversight  and  protection  was \nnot  subject  to  a  meaningful  professional,  administrative  or \njudicial  review. \n58.  Despite  Defendants'  almost  complete  lack  of \nmeaningful  contact  with  Jay  and  Candice  for  almost  three \nyears,  on  March  20,  2000,  Defendants  announced  their  intention \nto  remove  Jay  and  Candice  from  the  Real  Life  Ranch  almost \nimmediately,  place  them  in  an  interim  foster  placement  and \nthen  replace  them  in  yet  another  foster  home  to  which  their \nelder  brother would  also  be  moved.  This  plan  is  currently on \nhold,  but  since  Defendants  announced  their  intention  to  remove \nJay  and  Candice  from  the  Real  Life  Ranch,  they  have  excluded \nthe  personnel  of  the  Real  Life  Ranch  from  any  case  planning, \nstaffings  or  meetings  concerning  Jay  and  Candice.  Defendants \ncannot  make  competent  professional  judgments  about  how  these \nchildren  are  functioning,  what  their  needs  are,  and  what  plans \nare  appropriate  for  them  in  the  absence  of  information  from \nthe  responsible  adults  who  care  for  and  observe  Jay  and \nCandice  on  a  daily basis. \n59.  As  long  as  Jay  and  Candice  remain  in  foster  care, \nthey  are  at  substantial  and  very  real  risk  that  Defendants \nwill  return  to  their  long-standing  policy  and  practice  of \n26 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 27 of 116\ndenying  these  children  the  protection  of  monthly  caseworker \nvisits,  to  which  they  are  entitled. \n60.  Jay  and  Candice  are  at  imminent  risk  of  further \nserious  and  irreparable  injury because  Defendants  fail  to \nexercise  competent  professional  judgment  in  making  decisions \nconcerning  these  children's  care  and  safety  and  intentionally \nexclude  critically  important  and  readily  available  information \nfrom  that  decision-making  process.  Plaintiffs  Jay  D.  and \nCandice  D.  appear  by  their  next  friend  Lori  A.  Haythorn. \n8.  Matthew  I. \n61.  Plaintiff  foster  child Matthew  I.  is  two  years  old. \nHe  entered  foster  care  in  October  1999.  Matthew  was  neglected \nin  a  grossly  overcrowded  foster  home  in  Palm  Beach  County  that \nhoused  a  total  of  seven  children,  including  a  child with \nDown's  Syndrome,  whose  special  needs  placed  a  further  drain  on \nthe  foster  parents.  Defendants  were  fully  aware  of  the  number \nof  children  in  this  horne  when  they  placed  and  retained Matthew \nand  the  other  foster  children  there. \n62.  On  October  15,  1999,  a  worker  from  an  agency  that \ncontracts  with  Defendants  observed Matthew  to  be  very  sick,  to \nhave  difficulty breathing,  and  to  have  a  bite mark  on  his  arm. \nThe  foster  mother  reported  that  another  two-year-old  in  the \nfoster  horne  had  bitten Matthew. \n63.  On  November  6,  1999,  a  worker  from  the  same \ncontract-agency observed Matthew  to  be  very  dirty,  with  dirty \n27 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 28 of 116\nears,  dirty hair,  scaly  skin  on  his  scalp,  a  bruise  on  his \nchin,  a  dirty  diaper  with  red  sores  and  scabs  on  his  buttocks \nand  inner  thighs,  and  long,  dirty  finger  and  toe  nails. \nMatthew  was  again  very  sick  and  wheezing.  The  foster  home  was \nobserved  as  emitting  a  strong,  offensive  odor;  the  sink  was \noverflowing  with  dirty dishes;  old  food  was  on  the  floor;  and \nweeks'  worth  of  dirt  was  encrusted  on  the  floor.  The  contract \nagency  worker  took  Matthew  to  a  hospital  emergency  room.  He \nhad  a  fever  of  104  degrees  and  was  diagnosed  with  bacterial \npneumonia;  he  was  treated  and  released.  The  foster  home  was \nreported  to  Defendants'  child  abuse  ''Hotline\". \n64.  On  November  19,  1999,  a  DCAF  worker  observed \nMatthew  to  be  very  sick,  dirty  and  with  a  black  eye.  The \nfoster  mother  reported  that Matthew  and  another  child  fell  off \nthe  couch  while  fighting.  The  DCAF  worker  did  not  report  the \ncondition  of  the  foster  horne  or  of Matthew  to  the  \"Hotline\".  I \nDespite  repeated  observations  that  this  was  an  unfit  foster \nhome,  Defendants  did  not  remove  Matthew  from  this  home  until \nJanuary  17,  2000.  Matthew's  new  foster  mother  observed  him  to \nbe  very  sick  and  to  have  difficulty breathing  when  she \nreceived  him.  A  nebulizer  machine  was  provided  to  the  new \nfoster  horne  for  Matthew's  use,  but  the  new  foster  mother  did \nnot  know,  and  was  not  instructed,  how  to  use  it.  After  five \ndays  in  this  new  foster  home,  Matthew  was  observed  as  looking \nbetter  than  he  ever  had.  Instead  of  being  left  there,  he  was \n28 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 29 of 116\nreturned  to  the  previous  foster  home  on  January  24,  2000.  On \nat  least  three  subsequent  occasions,  Matthew  was  observed  as \nextremely dirty,  and  he  was  consistently  sick  at  his  day  care \ncenter.  Matthew  was  finally  removed  from  this  inadequate  and, \nfor  him,  dangerous  home  on  February  9,  2000. \n65.  Matthew  has  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer \nserious  and  irreparable  harm  as  a  result  of  Defendants' \nfailure  to  ensure  he  has  the  medical  care  and  living \nenvironment  that  meet  his  needs  and  do  not  subject  him  to \nharm.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \noperating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional  and  otherwise  illegal  manner,  Matthew  will \ncontinue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being \nsubjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  him  as  long  as  he  remains  in  Defendants'  custody. \nMatthew  I.  brings  this  action  through  Danielle  Roussel. \n9.  Hugh  S. \n66.  Plaintiff Hugh  S.  is  a  16-year-old  Palm  Beach \nCounty  foster  child.  In  1996,  when  he  was  twelve  years  old, \nhis  mother  died  and  his  father  turned  him  in  to  DCAF,  claiming \nhe  was  not  the  child's biological  father.  The  parental  rights \nof  the  father  were  never  terminated,  and  DCAF  has  neither \nlocated Hugh's  natural  father  nor  made  an  attempt  to  locate  a \ngood,  permanent  substitute  family  for  this  child. \n29 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 30 of 116\n67.  Hugh  has  been  moved  from  place  to  place  because  of \na  lack  of  placements  for  teenagers,  and  he  has  missed  a \nsignificant  amount  of  school,  having  spent  many  days  in  DCAF's \noffice  rather  than  in  school.  He  has  spent  weeks  not  knowing \nwhere  he  would  be  spending  the  night  from  one  night  to  the \nnext.  He  would  wait  in  the  DCAF  office  during  the  day  and  then \nbe  taken  to  a  place  in  the  evening  where  he  could  only  spend \none  night.  Night-to-night  placements  are  not  uncommon  for \nchildren  in  Defendants'  custody;  the  DCAF  pattern  and  practice \nof  not  timely moving  children  to  permanency  contribute  to \novercrowding  in  foster  placements  and  a  lack  of  sufficient, \nsafe,  suitable  foster  placements. \n68.  Hugh  has  had  inadequate  clothing,  and  often  had  no \njacket;  his  foster  home  did  not  have  the  funds  to  purchase  a \njacket  for  him.  This  situation prompted  complaints  to  DCAF \nfrom  his  school  that  he  would  come  to  school  with  inadequate \nand  dirty  clothes. \n69.  During  the  summer  of  2000,  Hugh  resided with  his \nfather  (who  originally placed him  into  foster  care),  but \nremained  in  Defendants'  custody  as  a  foster  child.  His  father \nthen  returned  Hugh  to  Defendants'  physical  custody,  and  he  was \nagain  on  the  night-to-night  circuit.  During  July  2000,  he \nresided  at  a  runaway  shelter,  although  he  is  not  a  runaway, \nand  had  only  one  change  of  clothing.  The  shelter  insisted Hugh \nattend  summer  school  because  all  of  the  youngsters  at  the \n30 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 31 of 116\nshelter  did  so,  although  he  had  inadequate  clothing  and  had \nnot  previously  been  in  summer  school.  Even  if Hugh  eventually \nreturns  to  his  father,  this  arrangement  could  easily disrupt, \nas  it has  in  the  past,  and  Hugh  could  remain  in  or  return  to \nfoster  care. \n70.  Hugh  has  been  and  continues  to  be  seriously  and \nirreparably  harmed  by  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  him  with \na  stable,  appropriate  placement,  to  achieve  permanency  for \nhim,  and  to  provide  for  his  basic  needs.  As  a  result  of \nDefendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  operating  the  Florida \nfoster  care  system  in  an  unconstitutional  and  otherwise \nillegal manner,  Hugh  will  continue  to  be  at  substantial  and \nimminent  risk  of  being  subjected  to  the  types  of  harm \nDefendants  have  already  inflicted on  him  as  long  as  he  remains \nin  Defendants'  custody.  He  brings  this  action  through  his  next \nfriend  Danielle  Roussel. \n10.  Leanne  and  Tammy  G. \n71.  Plaintiff  foster  child  Leanne  G.  is  a  two-and-one \nhalf-year-old Black  girl  who  was  taken  into  Defendants' \ncustody  and  placed  in  a  shelter  at  birth  and  entered  formal \nfoster  care  (after  dependency  adjudication)  as  a  young  infant \non  March  11,  1999.  Leanne  was  then  placed  in  a  neglectful  and \ninadequate  foster  home,  where  she  failed  to  thrive.  By  age  13 \nmonths,  Leanne  was  still not  on  solid  food  and  was  kept  in  her \ncrib  or  playpen  the  majority of  the  time. \n31 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 32 of 116\n72.  Leanne's  foster  mother  refused  to  take  the  child  to \nthe  pediatrician  between  March  17,  1999  and  September  10, \n1999.  When  the  DCAF  worker  finally  took  Leanne  to  the \npediatrician,  the  pediatrician  could  not  effectively  treat  the \nchild because  the  DCAF  worker  provided  no  information  about \nthe  child  and  the  foster  mother  refused  to  attend \nappointments.  The  pediatrician,  who  threatened  not  to  treat \nLeanne  any  further  unless  he  was  provided  with  necessary \ninformation,  also  noted  that  the  \"baby's  muscles  [were]  very \ntight ...  but  does  [sic]  not  bear  weight\"  and  that  the  \"baby \n[was]  not  receiving  therapies.\" \n73.  Leanne  has  five  siblings  in  foster  care,  including \nPlaintiff  Tammy  G.  Leanne  did  not  see  her  siblings  for  one \nyear.  There  is  no  legitimate  reason  for  Leanne's  and  Tammy's \nseparation  from  their  siblings  or  the  denial  of  sibling \nI \nvisitation.  The  decision  to  separate  these  children  and  deny \nthem  visitation with  each  other  was  not  reviewed  by  a \nprofessional  qualified by  training,  experience  and  credentials \nto  determine  whether  separating  the  children was  necessary  to \nprotect  their  health,  safety  and  welfare. \n74.  Defendants  have  separated  these  children  only \nbecause  they  do  not  have  a  sufficient  number  of  foster  homes \nthat  will  care  for  large  family  groups.  The  effects  of \nseparating  siblings  in  their placements  are  compounded  by  the \nDefendants'  unjustified  failure  to  arrange  for  visitations \n32 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 33 of 116\nbetween  siblings  at  least  once  monthly,  as  required  by  law. \nDefendants'  racially neutral  failure  to  recruit  a  sufficient \nnumber  of  foster  families  suitable  for  sibling  groups  and \ntheir  failure  to  provide  at  least monthly  visitations  between \nsiblings  has  a  disparate  impact  on  Black  siblings  in  foster \ncare,  making  sibling  separation more  likely  for  Black  foster \nchildren  than  for  White  foster  children;  has  had  the  effect  of \ndiscriminating  against  Tammy,  Leanne  and  other  Black  foster \nchildren  on  the  basis  of  their  race  or  color,  and  has  had  the \neffect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing  the \naccomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  defendants'  provision  of \nfoster  care  to  Tammy,  Leanne  and  other  Black  children  in \nDefendants'  custody. \n75.  Although  Leanne  has  been  placed  in  a  pre-adoptive \nhome,  DCAF  has  effectively put  the  adoption  on  hold  and  the \nprospective  adoption  and  the  placement  could  easily  disrupt  at \nany  time.  Defendants  do  not  have  an  alternative  strategy  for \nachieving  permanency  for  Leanne. \n76.  Defendants'  failure  to  achieve  permanency  for \nLeanne  has  resulted  from  Defendants'  practice  of  making  even \nless  effort  to  provide  services  and  develop  and  obtain \nappropriate  adoptive  placements  for  Black  foster  children  than \nfor  White  children  in  Defendants'  custody. \n77.  Defendants'  failure  to  develop  and  maintain  a \nsufficient  number  of  adoptive  homes  decrease  the  likelihood \n33 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 34 of 116\nchildren  will  achieve  permanency  expeditiously.  This  racially \nneutral  method  of  administration  has  a  disparate  impact  on \nBlack  children,  has  had  the  effect  of  discriminating  against \nLeanne  and  other  Black  foster  children who  are  appropriate  for \nadoption  on  the  basis  of  their  race  or  color,  and  has  had  the \neffect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing  the \naccomplishment  for  Leanne  and  similarly  situated Black  foster \nchildren  of  the  objectives  of  Defendants'  foster  care  and \nadoption  program. \n78.  Leanne  has  been  and  continues  to  be  irreparably and \nseriously  injured by  Defendants'  failure  to  protect  her  from \nharm,  to  meet  her  basic  needs,  to  achieve  permanency  for  her, \nand  to  place  her  with  her  siblings  or,  if that  would  be \nharmful  to  one  of  the  children,  as  determined  by  professional \ncompetent  to  make  such  a  determination,  to  provide  her  with \nregular  and  frequent  sibling visitation.  (Such  a  professional \nl \nmight,  but  would  not  necessarily,  find  that  a  delay  in \nachieving  permanency  for  one  of  the  children  would  pose  an \nunacceptable  risk  of  harm  to  the  child,  justifying \nseparation).  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice \nof  operating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional,  racially discriminatory  and  otherwise \nillegal  manner,  Leanne  will  continue  to  be  at  substantial  and \nimminent  risk  of  being  subjected  to  the  types  of  harm \nDefendants  have  already  inflicted on  her  as  long  as  she \n34 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 35 of 116\nremains  in  Defendants'  custody.  She  brings  this  action  through \nher  next  friend  Danielle  Roussel. \n79.  Plaintiff Tammy  G.  is  a  nine-year-old  Black  foster \nchild  from  District  9  who  was  placed  in  foster  care  on  October \n21,  1997,  at  the  same  time  as  four  of  her  siblings.  She  has \nseen  her  siblings  only  once  during  the  past  year.  Her  younger \nsister,  Plaintiff Leanne,  came  into  care  in  1999,  and  the  six \nsiblings  are  in  six  different  homes. \n80.  Tammy  has  been  in  four  separate  homes  in  the  past \nthree  years.  In  one  home,  the  foster  parent  punished  Tammy  by \nforcing  her  to  stand  with  one  leg  in  the  air,  for  considerable \nperiods  of  time.  In  another  placement,  the  foster  mother \nabusively  punished  her  by  twisting  her  arm  behind  her  back  and \nby  twisting  her  nose.  The  abuse  was  not  adequately \ninvestigated  by  DCAF,  consistent  with  its pattern  and  practice \nof  greater  toleration of  child  abuse  committed  by  DCAF  agents \nand  contract  providers  than  that  allegedly  committed  by \nparents. \n81.  In  her  current  DCAF-selected  placement,  Tammy \nsleeps  with  three  other  children  in  a  room  attached  to  a \nconverted  garage.  This  room  has  central  air  conditioning,  but \nthe  air  conditioning  is  not  used.  Tammy  is  not  being  fed \nproperly  in  this  foster  home. \n82.  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  Tammy  with  the \nservices  she  needed  to  achieve  permanency,  including  but  not \n35 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 36 of 116\nlimited  to  taking  the  reasonable,  necessary  steps  to  seek  and \nsecure  an  appropriate  adoptive  home  for  her,  resulted  from \nDefendants'  practice  of  treating  Black  and  White  foster \nchildren  differently based  on  their  race  or  color. \nDefendants'  failure  to  achieve  permanency  for  Tammy  is  also \ndue  to  Defendants'  practice  of  making  even  less  effort  to \nprovide  services  and  develop  and  obtain  appropriate  adoptive \nplacements  for  Black  foster  children  than  for  White  children \nin  Defendants'  custody. \n83.  Defendants'  failure  to  develop  and  maintain  a \nsufficient  number  of  adoptive  homes  decrease  the  likelihood \nchildren will  achieve  permanency  expeditiously.  This  racially \nneutral  practice  has  a  disparate  impact  on  Black  children,  has \nhad  the  effect  of  discriminating  against  Tammy  and  other  Black \nfoster  children  appropriate  for  adoption  on  the  basis  of  their \nrace  or  color;  and  has  had  the  effect  of  defeating  or \nsubstantially  impairing  the  accomplishment  of  the  objectives \nof  Defendants'  foster  care  and  adoption  program  for  Tammy  and \nother  similarly  situated Black  foster  children. \n84.  Tammy  has  been  and  continues  to  be  irreparably  and \nvery  seriously  injured  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to \nprotect  her  from  harm  and  to  provide  her  with  both  a  stable \nplacement  and  permanency,  as  well  as  by  Defendants'  separation \nof  Tammy  from  her  siblings  and  denial  of  regular  and  frequent \nvisitation.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \n36 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 37 of 116\noperating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional,  racially  discriminatory  and  otherwise \nillegal manner,  Tammy  will  continue  to  be  at  substantial  and \nimminent  risk  of  being  subjected  to  the  types  of  harm \nDefendants  have  already  inflicted on  her  as  long  as  she \nremains  in  Defendants'  custody.  She  brings  this  action  through \nher  next  friend  Danielle  Roussel. \n11.  Elaine  R. \n85.  Plaintiff Elaine  R.  is  an  eleven-year-old  Dade \nCounty  child who  was  taken  into  Defendants'  custody  in  1993 \nand  has  languished  in  foster  care  since  then.  Separated  for  no \nreason  from  her  siblings,  who  are  also  in  foster  care,  she \nfinally  had  parental  rights  terminated  in  or  before  August \n1997  and  was  then  placed  for  adoption  with  a  licensed  foster \nfamily.  At  the  time  of  this  placement,  the  father  of  this \nfoster  family  already  had  a  criminal  record  for  sexually \nabusing  children.  Elaine  lived  nearly  twelve  months  in  that \npre-adoptive  home,  subjected  to  multiple  sexual  assaults  and \nabuse  before  she  was  removed  from  this  foster  home  and \ncriminal  charges  were  instituted against  the  foster  father. \n86.  A  suitable  adoptive  parent  has  now  been  found  for \nElaine,  but  Defendants  are  delaying  this  adoption,  thereby \ndenying  Elaine  the  opportunity  to  have  a  real,  permanent \nfamily.  Defendants  have  no  alternative  strategy by  which \nElaine  will  achieve  permanency. \n37 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 38 of 116\n87.  Elaine  has  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer  serious \nand  irreparable  injury  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to \nprotect  her  from  harm,  to  protect  her  interest  in  living  and \nmaintaining  contact  with  her  siblings,  and  to  provide  her  with \na  permanent,  legally  stable  family.  As  a  result  of  Defendants' \npattern and  practice  of  operating  the  Florida  foster  care \nsystem  in  an  unconstitutional  and  otherwise  illegal  manner, \nElaine  will  continue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of \nbeing  subjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  her  as  long  as  she  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  She  brings  this  action  through  her  guardian  ad  litem \nKristi  Kassebaum. \n12.  Paul  B. \n88.  Plaintiff  Paul  B.  is  a  16-year-old Black  foster \nchild  from  Palm  Beach  County.  While  living with  his  biological \nfamily,  he  was  placed  under  DCAF  supervision  in April  1983  at \nthe  age  of  two  weeks  and  remained  under  DCAF  supervision  until \nhe  entered  foster  care  in  September  of  1993,  at  the  age  of  ten \nyears.  Paul  has  had  at  least  33  placements,  including  a  period \nat  a  DCAF  shelter  (although  he  had  already  been  adjudicated \ndependent),  where  he  was  placed  due  to  a  claimed  lack  of \nfoster  homes.  This  shelter  facility was  used  to  house  juvenile \ndelinquents,  some  of  whom  were  violent  offenders. \n89.  Paul's  multiple moves,  as  well  as  his  having  to \nattend  school  at  such  shelter  facilities,  have  caused  him  to \n38 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 39 of 116\nfall  behind  in  his  education.  The  Palm  Beach  County  Board  of \nEducation  has  no  record  that  Paul  attended  school  during  an \nentire  academic  year  Paul  spent  in  a  DCAF  facility. \n90.  Paul  has,  moreover,  been  denied  a  good  permanent \nfamily.  Paul's  parents'  rights  were  terminated,  but  he  was \nnever  placed  for  adoption. \n91.  The  outrageous  number  of  times  Defendants  moved \nPaul  and  their  failure  to  provide  him  with  the  services  he \nneeded  to  achieve  permanency,  including  but  not  limited  to  the \nplacement  of  Paul  in  an  adoptive  home,  resulted  from \nDefendants'  practice  of  treating  Black  and  White  foster \nchildren  differently based  on  their  race  or  color.  The \nshocking  instability of  Paul's  placements  and  the  failure  to \nachieve  permanency  for  him  are  also  due  to  Defendants' \npractice  of  making  even  less  effort  to  provide  services  to  and \ndevelop  and  obtain  appropriate  foster  and  permanent  placements \nfor  Black  foster  children  than  for  White  children  in \nDefendants'  custody. \n92.  Defendants'  failure  to  develop  and  maintain  a \nsufficient  number  of  appropriate  foster  and  adoptive \nplacements  increases  the  likelihood  children will  be  placed \nwith  foster  parents  incapable  of  caring  for  them,  which,  in \nturn,  leads  to  disrupted  and  multiple  placements.  The  lack  of \nplacements  also  decreases  the  chance  children will  achieve \npermanency  expeditiously.  This  racially neutral  method  of \n39 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 40 of 116\nadministration  (the  failure  to  maintain  a  sufficient  number  of \nfoster  placements)  has  had  a  disparate  impact  on  Black  foster \nchildren,  has  had  the  effect  of  discriminating  against  Paul \nand  other  Black  foster  children  on  the  basis  of  their  race  or \ncolor,  and  has  had  the  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \nimpairing  the  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  Defendants' \nplacement  of  Paul  and  other  similarly  situated Black  children, \nout  of  their  own  home  and  into  foster  care. \n93.  Paul  has  and  continues  to  suffer  serious  and \nirreparable  harm  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to  provide \nhim  with  a  safe,  stable  and  secure  placement,  to  ensure  he \nreceived  an  adequate  education,  and  to  provide  him  with  a \npermanent,  legally  stable  family.  Paul's  injuries  also \nresulted  from  Defendants'  racial  discrimination.  Paul  is \ncurrently  in  Defendants'  legal  custody.  As  a  result  of \nDefendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  operating  the  Florida \nfoster  care  system  in  an  unconstitutional,  racially \ndiscriminatory  and  otherwise  illegal  manner,  Paul  will \ncontinue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being \nsubjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  him  as  long  as  he  remains  in  Defendants'  custody. \nHe  brings  this  action  through  his  next  friend  Danielle \nRoussel. \n13.  Rachel  c. \n40 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 41 of 116\n94.  Plaintiff Rachel  C.  is  a  13-year-old  Palm  Beach \nCounty  child  kept  by  DCAF  in  a  temporary  shelter  for  more  than \n12  months,  from  approximately  October  5,  1998  through \napproximately April  3,  2000.  At  this  shelter,  Rachel  was \nhoused  with  girls  with  significant mental  health  and \ndelinquency  histories,  rendering  this  facility  entirely \ninappropriate  for  her.  While  Rachel  resided  there,  she  was \ncharged  as  a  delinquent.  Rachel  left  Defendants'  care  in April \n2000  to  reside  with  an  uncle,  but  returned  to  Defendants' \ncustody  on  June  13,  2000.  Rachel  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody  as  a  foster  child,  and  is  in  a  shelter. \n95.  Rachel  has  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer \nirreparable  and  very  serious  harm  as  a  result  of  Defendants' \nfailure  to  provide  her  with  a  safe,  stable  and  secure \nplacement.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \noperating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional  and  otherwise  illegal  manner,  Rachel  will \ncontinue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being \nsubjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  her  as  long  as  she  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  Rachel  C.  brings  this  action  through  her  next  friend \nDanielle  Roussel. \n14.  Cathy  W. \n96.  Plaintiff Cathy  W.  is  a  twelve-year-old  child who \nwas  held  in  a  temporary  shelter  in  District  9  beginning  in May \n41 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 42 of 116\n1999,  even  though  the  Defendants  knew  the  placement  exposed \nher  to  significant  danger  and  provided  her  with  inadequate \nsupervision.  Cathy  was  involved  in  several  sexual  incidents  at \nthe  shelter,  which  were  clearly and  obviously  foreseeable, \ngiven  the  past  behavior  of  the  youngsters  involved,  the \ninappropriateness  and  danger  created  by  having  these  children \nin  the  same  facility,  and  the  absence  of minimally  competent \nsupervision of  these  children.  Cathy  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody  as  a  foster  child. \n97.  While  in  this  chaotic  and  inadequately  supervised \nenvironment,  Cathy  was  charged  as  a  delinquent.  She  remains \nin  Defendants'  custody  as  a  foster  child  and  has  since  been \nplaced  in  a  residential  treatment  facility.  As  a  result  of \nthese  incidents  and  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  Cathy  with \na  safe,  stable  placement,  Cathy  has  been  seriously  and \nirreparably harmed  and  her  health  has  been  placed  at  grave \nrisk.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \noperating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional  and  otherwise  illegal manner,  Cathy  will \ncontinue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being \nsubjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  her  as  long  as  she  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  Cathy  W.  brings  this  action  through  Danielle  Roussel. \n15.  Larissa  c. \n42 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 43 of 116\n98.  Plaintiff  Larissa  C.  was  two  years  old  in  July \n2000.  While  in  foster  care,  she  was  placed  in  an  abusive  and \nneglectful  foster  placement  in  Flagler  County  where  she  was \nsubjected  to  repeated  abuse.  Defendants  failed  both  to  screen \nthis  foster  home  adequately  before  placing  Larissa  there  and \nto  supervise  the  foster  home  while  she  lived  there.  The \ntraumatic  brain  injuries  inflicted upon  this  child by  the \nfoster  parents  DCAF  selected  and  then  failed  to  supervise  have \nleft  her  partially paralyzed  with  impaired  vision  and  speech. \nLarissa  remains  in  Defendants'  custody  as  a  foster  child. \n99.  Larissa  has  been  and  continues  to  be  irreparably \nand  very  seriously  injured  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure \nto  protect  her  from  harm.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern \nand  practice  of  operating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional  and  otherwise  illegal  manner,  Larissa  will \ncontinue  to  be  at  substantial  and  imminent  risk  of  being \nsubjected  to  the  types  of  harm  Defendants  have  already \ninflicted on  her  as  long  as  she  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  She  brings  this  action  through  her  attorney  ad  litem \nand  next  friend  Rhoda  Goodson. \n16.  John  J. \n100.  Plaintiff  John  J.  (twelve  years  of  age)  entered \nDefendants'  custody  as  a  foster  child  in  approximately  1989 \nand  is  still  in  foster  care.  John  has  been  in multiple \ndifferent  foster  placements.  Until  recently,  Defendants  failed \n43 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 44 of 116\nto  search  for  a  suitable  relative  placement,  although  it was \ndiscovered  years  after  he  entered  Defendants'  custody  that  an \nappropriate  aunt  was  willing  to  care  for  John. \n101.  During  his  stay  in  foster  custody,  DCAF  District \n6/Hi1lsborough  County  DCAF  kept  John  for  more  than  12  months \nat  an  over-crowded  foster  home  where  he  was  subjected  to \nbeatings  and  horrible,  sadistic  abuse,  including  hot  sauce \napplied  to  his  tongue,  his  face  dunked  in  the  toilet bowl  and \nkept  there  until  he  gasped  for  breath,  and  ridicule,  all \nprohibited by  the  Defendants'  rules.  Although  DCAF's  rules \nprohibit  more  than  five  children  in  a  house,  this  house  was \nlicensed  for  seven  children  during  the  pertinent  time. \nFollowing  DCAF's  express  rejection,  in  1993,  of  a  request  to \nincrease  the  licensed  number  to  ten  children,  there  were  in \nfact  ten  or more  children  there  during  the  material  times. \nWhen  the  child  abuse  \"Hotline\"  was  called,  DCAF  ignored  the \n' \nabuses,  exonerated  the  foster  parents  and  kept  the  home  open. \n102.  John  has  suffered  and  continues  to  suffer  serious \nand  irreparable  injury  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to \nprotect  him  from  harm  and  Defendants'  delay  in  providing  him \nwith  an  opportunity  for  a  permanent,  legally  stable  family.  As \na  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  operating  the \nFlorida  foster  care  system  in  an  unconstitutional  and \notherwise  illegal  manner,  John  will  continue  to  be  at \nsubstantial  and  imminent  risk of  being  subjected  to  the  types \n44 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 45 of 116\nof  harm  Defendants  have  already  inflicted on  him  as  long  as  he \nremains  in  Defendants'  custody.  John  J.  brings  this  action \nthrough  his  next  friend Mary  Miller. \n18.  Melinda  and  Karina \n103.  Plaintiff Karina  (17  years  of  age)  is  one  of  two \nDade  County  DCAF/District  11  sisters  held  by  the  State  of \nFlorida  in  foster  care  since  1986;  they  were  four  and  two \nyears  of  age  when  they  entered  Defendants'  custody.  Now  18, \nMelinda  should  still be  in  foster  care,  participating  in  the \nsubsized  independent  living  program.  DCAF  conferred  with  her \nwithout  her  guardian  ad  litem or  her  attorneys  present  and \ncoerced  and  misled  her  to  allegedly  sign  a  form  purportedly \nending  foster  care  efforts  for  her.  Defendants  have  not \nprovided Melinda's  guardian  ad  litem or  court-appointed \ncounsel  with  a  copy  of  the  alleged  form;  Plaintiffs  believe \nany  such  form  to  be  invalid,  under  the  circumstances  existing, \nand  efforts  for  Melinda  to  re-access  services  to  which  she  may \nbe  entitled are  ongoing.  Plaintiff Karina  remains  in  foster \ncare.  Neither  was  ever  placed  for  adoption,  and  Defendants \nnever  pursued  an  alternative  form  of  permanency  for  either \nchild.  In  fact,  despite  adoption  being  recommended  several \ntimes  by  some  DCAF  caseworkers  and  DCAF  retained  therapists, \nthese  girls  were  never  even  available  for  adoption  because \nDefendants,  contrary  to  law,  made  absolutely  no  efforts  to \nterminate  the  parental  rights  of  their  absent  father  and  give \n45 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 46 of 116\nthem  an  opportunity  for  permanency,  even  though  DCAF  knew  the \nlack  of  a  permanent  family  was  seriously harming  the  girls. \n104.  During  their  14  years  in  Florida's  foster  care \nsystem,  Melinda  and  Karina  have  been  subjected  to  rapes, \nbeatings  and  neglect.  Melinda  contracted  syphilis  when  she  was \nnine  years  old.  The  girls  have  been  wrongly  separated  from \neach  other.  Their  minds  have  been  damaged  by  years  of \npsychotropic  medications  administered  for  non-therapeutic \nreasons  with  Defendants'  approval  for  the  convenience  of  their \ncaretakers.  They  have  been  confined  for  years  needlessly  in \nrestricted,  locked  facilities  and  held  there  as  virtual \ncaptives.  Melinda  and  Karina  now  have  permanent  mental \ndisabilities. \n105.  Although  of mixed  Hispanic  descent,  Melinda  and \nKarina  were  labeled  and  treated  as  African-American  children. \nThe  number  of  placements  to  which  Defendants  subjected Melinda \nand  Karina  and  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  them  with  the \nservices  they  needed  to  achieve  permanency,  including but  not \nlimited  to  the  prosecution  of  a  proceeding  to  terminate \nparental  rights  of  their  father  and  placement  of  these  girls \nin  an  adoptive  home,  resulted  from  Defendants'  practice  of \ntreating  Black  and  White  foster  children  differently based  on \ntheir  race  or  color.  Melinda's  and  Karina's  lack  of  a  stable \nplacement  and  a  permanent  family  are  also  due  to  Defendants' \npractice  of  making  even  less  effort  to  provide  services  and \n46 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 47 of 116\ndevelop  and  obtain  appropriate  foster  and  adoptive  placements \nfor  Black  foster  children  than  for  White  children  in \nDefendants'  custody. \n106.  Defendants'  failure  to  develop  and  maintain  a \nsufficient  number  of  appropriate  foster  and  adoptive \nplacements  increases  the  likelihood  children  will  be  placed \nwith  foster  parents  incapable  of  caring  for  them  which  in  turn \nleads  to  disrupted  and  multiple  placements.  The  lack  of \nplacements  also  decreases  the  chance  children  will  achieve \npermanency  expeditiously.  These  racially  neutral  practices \nhave  a  disparate  impact  on  children  of  color  and  have  had  the \neffect of  discriminating  against Melinda  and  Karina  and  other \nsimilarly  situated  foster  children  on  the  basis  of  their  color \nor  their  race  or  perceived  race,  and  have  had  the  effect  of \ndefeating  or  substantially  impairing  the  accomplishment  of  the \nobjectives  of  Defendants'  provision  of  foster  care  for  Melinda \nand  Karina  and  other  children  of  color. \n107.  Karina,  the  younger  sister,  remains  in  Defendants' \ncustody  as  a  foster  child  and  does  not  have  a  permanent \nfamily,  and  is  currently absent  from  her  placement  without \npermission.  Defendants  have  done  little or  nothing  to  recover \nKarina,  although,  while  absent  from  her  placement,  she  has \nbeen  seriously  injured and  continues  to  be  at  grave  and \nimminent  risk  of  further  harm. \n47 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 48 of 116\n108.  Melinda  is  now  18  years  of  age,  and  she  is  either \nstill  in  Defendants'  legal  custody  or  was  misled  or  coerced  by \nDefendants  into  leaving  their  custody.  Melinda  meets  the \neligibility criteria  for  remaining  in  foster  care  beyond  her \n18th  birthday,  but  Defendants  have  effectively  denied  her  this \noption without  the  opportunity  for  a  hearing  to  determine  her \neligibility and  entitlement  to  remain  in  foster  care. \n109.  Until  the  Florida  Dependency  Court  took  the  unusual \nstep  of  appointing  an  attorney  for  Melinda,  [something  which \ndoes  not  occur  for  most  children  in  dependency  proceedings], \nDefendants  had  consistently deprived  her  of  an  opportunity  to \nattend  and  participate  in  judicial  and  administrative  reviews \nthat  addressed  her  legal,  custodial  and  permanency  status. \nDefendants  have  failed  to  notify Melinda  of  the  judicial  and \nadministrative  reviews,  although  they  routinely  provide  notice \nto  the  other  parties  concerning  these  types  of  proceedings, \nthe  court  had  not  determined  her  attendance  at  judicial  review \nhearings  was  not  in her  best  interests,  and  Defendants  had  not \ndetermined  she  had  insufficient maturity  to  attend \nadministrative  reviews  of  her  case.  Defendants  have  also \nfailed  to  provide  the  services,  such  as  transportation,  that \nMelinda  needed  in  order  to  be  able  to  attend  and  participate \nin  these  proceedings,  and  she  had  no  other  source  from  which \nto  obtain  these  services.  Additionally,  Defendants  arbitrarily \nand  capriciously prevented Melinda  from  participating  in \n48 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 49 of 116\nDCAF's  process  for  developing  a  case  plan  for  her,  although  it \nwould  have  been  appropriate  for  her  to  participate  in  this \nprocess.  Melinda's  case  plan  addresses,  among  other  things, \nthe  appropriateness  of  retaining  her  in  Defendants'  custody, \nher  current  placement,  the  services  provided  to  her,  her \nparticipation  in  an  Independent  Living  Program,  and  other \nissues  that  are  critical  to  her  well  being  and  development. \n110.  Melinda  and  Karina  have  suffered  and  continue  to \nsuffer  irreparable  and  very  serious  injury  as  a  result  of \nDefendants'  failure  to  protect  them  from  harm,  to  provide  them \nwith  the  opportunity  to  have  a  permanent,  legally  stable \nfamily,  and  to  provide  them  with  appropriate  care.  Melinda  has \nfurther  been  seriously  and  irreparably harmed  by  being \ndeprived  of  continuing  foster  care  services  through \nDefendants'  arbitrary  and  capricious  actions  and  be  being \ndenied  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  all  court  hearings, \nadministrative  reviews  and  the  development  of  case  plans  that \naffect  her.  As  a  result  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \noperating  the  Florida  foster  care  system  in  an \nunconstitutional,  racially discriminatory  and  otherwise \nillegal  manner,  Melinda  and  Karina  will  continue  to  be  at \nsubstantial  and  imminent  risk of  being  subjected  to  the  types \nof  harm  Defendants  have  already  inflicted on  them  as  long  as \nthey  remain  in  Defendants'  custody.  The  girls  are  acting \nthrough  their  guardian  ad  litem Brenda  B.  Shapiro. \n49 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 50 of 116\nD.  DEFENDANTS \n111.  Defendant  Jeb  Bush  is  the  Governor  of  the  State  of \nFlorida,  the  head  of  the  Executive  Branch  of  government  and \nthe  person  responsible  for  the  proper  operation  of  the  foster \ncare  and  adoption  systems  and  for  the  hiring  and  continued \nemployment  of  Kathleen  Kearney,  Secretary  of  DCAF.  Defendant \nBush  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity.  By  law,  Defendant  Bush \nis  responsible  for  supervising  Defendant  Kearney.  He  is  also \nresponsible  for  the  proper  administration  of  DCAF,  proposing  a \nproper  budget  for  DCAF  to  the  legislature  and  assuring  that \nDCAF  operates  in  conformity  with  the  federal  law  and  State \nplans  submitted  to  the  federal  government,  which  allow  Florida \nto  qualify  for  funding  under  Title  IV  and  Title  XIX  of  the \nSocial  Security Act,  including  the  Adoption  and  Safe  Families \nAct  and  the  EPSDT  provisions  of  the Medicaid  Title  of  the \nfederal  Social  Security Act. \n112.  Defendant  Bush  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  DCAF \nis  operated  in  accordance  with  federal  law  and  protects  the \nfederally  ensured  civil  rights  of  the  children  in  Florida \nfoster  care,  to  ensure  that  the  system  is  not  operated \nrecklessly or  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the  needs, \nsafety,  lives  and  rights  of  Florida's  foster  children. \nAdditionally,  since  his  inauguration  in  January  1999, \nDefendant  Bush  has  directed  the  operation  of  Florida's  foster \ncare  system  and  dictated  the  actions  to  be  taken  by  the  other \n50 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 51 of 116\nDefendants  in  the  operation of  Florida's  foster  care  system  in \na  manner  that  is  contrary  to  law  and  proper,  competent \nprofessional  standards. \n113.  Defendant  Kathleen  Kearney  is  Secretary  of  the \nDepartment  of  Children  and  Families  of  the  State  of  Florida. \nShe  is  sued  in  her  official  capacity.  Under  Florida  law, \nDefendant  Kearney  is  responsible  for  supervising,  directing, \norganizing,  planning,  administering  and  executing  the \nfunctions  of  DCAF,  for  ensuring  that  DCAF  performance  is  in \ncompliance  with  federal  law,  for  operating  the  foster  care \nsystem  in  such  a  way  as  to  protect  the  lives,  safety,  health \nand  rights  of  the  children  in  Florida  foster  care  and  for \nensuring  it  is  operated  in  such  a  manner  that  competent \nprofessional  judgment  is  exercised  in  caring  for  the  children. \nAdditionally,  she  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  DCAF  agents \nand  employees  exercise  proper  professional  judgment  consistent \nwith  professional  standards  in  caring  for  the  children  subject \nto  their  jurisdiction  and  in  their  care.  Defendant  Kearney  is \nalso  responsible  to  ensure  that  the  system  is  not  operated \nrecklessly  or  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the  needs, \nsafety,  lives  and  rights  of  Florida's  foster  children.  In  this \nrole,  she  serves  at  the  pleasure  of  and  subject  to  the \ndirection  of  Defendant  Bush. \n114.  Defendants  Bates,  Awad,  Tibbs,  Johnson,  Richard, \nDixon,  Morin,  Gibbons,  Brown,  Auslander,  Davenport,  Howard, \n51 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 52 of 116\nGray  and  Martin  are  the  District Administrators  of  DCAF's \nDistricts  One  through  Nine  and  Eleven  through  Fifteen, \nrespectively  [collectively referred  to  as  \"District \nAdministrators\"].  They  are  sued  in  their  official  capacity. \nEach  District Administrator  serves  at  the  pleasure  and \ndirection  of  Defendants  Kearney  and  Bush;  each  serves  as  the \nlocal  official  in  charge  in  their  respective  DCAF  districts, \nto  ensure  that  the  children  in  Defendants'  custody  are  free \nfrom  harm  and  receive  proper  care  while  in  state  foster  care. \nThey  also  have  the  legal  duty  to  ensure  that  the  foster  care \nsystem  is  operated  in  accordance  with  federal  law  and  protects \nthe  civil  rights  of  the  children  in  Florida  foster  care.  Each \nDistrict Administrator  is  further  obligated  to  ensure  that \nproper  professional  standards  and  judgment  are  exercised  in \ndetermining  and  providing  for  the  protection,  familial  and \npermanency  needs  of  the  children  in  foster  care,  and  to  ensure \nthat  the  system  is  not  operated  recklessly or  with  deliberate \nindifference  to  the  needs,  safety,  lives  and  rights  of \nFlorida's  foster  children. \n115.  Defendants  are  aware  of  the  rampant  deficiencies  in \nthe  operation  of  the  Florida  foster  care/adoption  system  and \nhave  failed  to  take  the  steps  needed  to  cause  it to  operate  in \na  manner  that  does  not  violate  the  federally  protected  rights \nof  the  children  in  Defendants'  care,  but  instead  is  operated \nin  conformity  with  accepted  professional  standards. \n52 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 53 of 116\n116.  At  all  times  and  in  all  respects  relevant  to  the \nclaims  herein,  Defendants  Bush,  Kearney  and  the  District \nAdministrators  were  acting  in  their  official  capacities  and \nunder  color  of  state  law. \nE.  CLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n1.  The  System-Wide  Class \n117.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  on  behalf  of  themselves \nand  all  others  similarly  situated pursuant  to  Rule  23{a)  and \n23{b) {2)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  The  class \nconsists  of  all  children  who  are  currently  or  who  will  be  in \nthe  custody  of  Defendants  as  an  alleged  or  adjudicated \ndependent  child. \n118.  Every  child  in  foster  care  is  directly  and  adversely \naffected by  the  Defendants'  deficient  operation  of  Florida's \nfoster  care  system  and  specifically by  Defendants'  acts  and \ndecisions  that  impair  the  children's  federally  protected \nrights  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to  comply  with \naccepted  professional  standards  and  to  exercise  competent \nprofessional  judgment.  Children  who  have  the  misfortune  of \nbeing  taken  into  Florida's  foster  care  system  routinely  have \ntheir  rights  deliberately disregarded  by  Defendants  and  are \nlikely  to  be  harmed  by  the  experience. \n119.  Plaintiffs  are  members  of  the  class  they  seek  to \nrepresent;  each  Plaintiff  and  each  putative  class  member  is \ncurrently  in  Defendants'  custody,  with  the  possible  exception \n53 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 54 of 116\nof Melinda  who,  if she  is  not  in  Defendants'  custody,  was \nimproperly  coerced  or  misled by  Defendants  into  leaving  foster \ncare. \n120.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  class \nmembers  is  impracticable.  There  are  presently  approximately \n15,000  children  in  Florida  foster  care,  including  foster  home \ncare,  emergency  shelter  care  and  residential  group  care,  and \nDefendants  expect  this  population  to  increase  to  over  18,000 \nby  June  2001.  by  Issue  and  Appropriation \n~Expenditures \nCategory,  Detail  of  Expenditures,  Exhibit  D-3A\"  September  10, \n1999,  at  145-46;  hereinafter  Document.\") \n~Budget \n121.  There  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  that  are  common \nto  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class  they  seek  to \nrepresent,  and  the  claims  of  the  Plaintiffs  are  typical  of  the \nclaims  of  the  other  class  members.  Each  Plaintiff  and  each \nputative  class  member  is  in  need  of  safe  and  adequate  foster \ncare,  must  rely on  Defendants  for  the  provision  of  all  care, \ntreatment  and  services  they  need,  and  is  harmed  by  the \nDefendants'  systemic  failures  to  fulfill  their  legal \nobligations  in  the  provision  of  such  care,  treatment  and \nservices. \n122.  The  common  questions  of  fact  shared  by  Plaintiffs \nand  the  members  of  the  class  they  seek  to  represent  include: \na.  Whether  Defendants  fail  to  provide  children  in \ntheir  custody  with  safe,  stable  and  secure  foster  care \n54 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 55 of 116\nplacements,  as  required by  law  and  accepted  professional \nstandards; \nb.  Whether  Defendants  fail  to  provide  foster \nchildren  with  legally  required  services,  consistent  with \naccepted professional  standards,  that  are  necessary  to \nprevent  the  children  from  deteriorating while  in \nDefendants'  custody,  including  appropriate  medical  and \neducational  services;  and \nc.  Whether  Defendants  fail  expeditiously  to  take \nreasonable  steps  to  seek  and  secure  for  the  children  in \ntheir  custody  a  permanent,  legally stable  family,  as \nrequired by  federal  law  and  accepted  professional \nstandards. \n123.  Questions  of  law  common  to  Plaintiffs  and  their \nputative  class  members  include: \na.  Whether  Defendants'  actions  and  inactions  violate \nrights  secured  to  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class \nthey  seek  to  represent  by  the  First,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution;  and \nb.  Whether  Defendants'  actions  and  inactions  violate \nrights  secured  to  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  class \nthey  seek  to  represent  by  the  Adoption  Assistance  and \nSafe  Families  Act  and  the  EPSDT  provisions  of  the  Social \nSecurity Act. \n55 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 56 of 116\n124.  The  legal  claims  alleged by  the  Plaintiffs  are \ntypical  and  representative  of  those  of  the  members  of  the \nputative  class.  The  injuries  Plaintiffs  have  and  continue  to \nsuffer  are  typical  of  the  injuries  the  proposed  class  members \nhave  suffered  and  continue  to  suffer.  Declaratory  and \nequitable  relief  addressed  to  the  putative  class  members' \nclaims  and  injuries  will  address  equally  the  claims  and \ninjuries  of  the  individual  named  Plaintiffs. \n125.  The  representative  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and \nadequately  protect  the  interests  of  the  class.  They  bring  this \naction  through  their  well-qualified  representatives,  including \nguardians  ad  litem and  next  friends.  They  are  represented by \ngeographically  diverse,  competent  counsel  including  board \ncertified civil  trial  and  appellate  lawyers  and  attorneys  with \nexperience  in  class  action  litigation  and  child  advocacy. \n126.  The  Defendants  have  acted  and  refused  to  act  on \ngrounds  generally  applicable  to  all members  of  the  class, \nmaking  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  and  corresponding \ndeclaratory  relief with  respect  to  the  class  as  a  whole. \n127.  Although  they  are  the  legal  custodians  of  the \nPlaintiffs  and  all  members  of  the  putative  class,  Defendants \nhave  an  inescapable  and  inherent  conflict  of  interest  with \nthese  children  and  cannot  bring  this  action  against  themselves \non  behalf  of  these  children. \n56 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 57 of 116\n2.  The  Subclass  of  Black  Foster  Children \n128.  Plaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie \nS.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and  Karina  bring  this  action \non  behalf  of  themselves  and  all  others  similarly situated \npursuant  to  Rule  23(a)  and  23(b) (2)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of \nCivil  Procedure.  The  subclass  consists  of  all  children who  are \nBlack  or  are  perceived by  Defendants  as  being  Black  and  are  or \nwill  be  in  the  custody  of  Defendants  as  an  alleged  or \ndependent  child.  All  putative  subclass  members  are  also \nmembers  of  the  system-wide  class  of  foster  children  that  all \nPlaintiffs  seek  to  represent,  and  the  allegations  concerning \nthe  class  as  a  whole  are  incorporated here  by  reference. \n129.  Every  Black  child  in  foster  care  is  directly  and \nadversely  affected by  the  Defendants'  racially discriminatory \noperation  of  Florida's  foster  care  system. \n130.  Plaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie \nS.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and  Karina  are  members  of  the \nsubclass  they  seek  to  represent;  each  such  Plaintiff  and  each \nputative  class  member  is  in  Defendants'  custody,  with  the \npossible  exception  of Melinda,  who,  if she  is  not  in \nDefendants'  custody,  was  coerced  or  misled  by  Defendants  into \nleaving  foster  care. \n131.  The  subclass  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all \nsubclass  members  is  impracticable.  There  are  presently at \nleast  6,000  Black  children  in  Florida  foster  care,  including \n57 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 58 of 116\nfoster  horne  care,  residential  group  care  and  emergency  shelter \ncare,  and  this  number  is  increasing. \n132.  There  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  that  are  common \nto  Plaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S., \nTammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and  Karina,  and  the  members  of \nthe  subclass  they  seek  to  represent,  and  the  claims  of  these \nPlaintiffs  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  other  subclass \nmembers. \n133.  The  common  questions  of  fact  shared  by  Plaintiffs \nPaul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne \nG.,  Melinda  and  Karina  and  the  members  of  the  subclass  they \nseek  to  represent  include: \na.  Whether  Defendants  treat  Black  foster  children \ndifferently  from  White  children  in  Defendants'  custody \nbecause  of  their  race  or  color,  in  the  provision  of \nfoster  care  or  adoption  services  to  them,  such  as \nproviding  safe,  secure,  stable  foster  care  placements; \nprosecuting  termination  of  parental  rights  proceedings; \nand  placing  children  in  adoptive  or  other  permanent \nhomes;  and \nb.  Whether  Defendants  utilize  racially neutral \ncriteria or  methods  of  administering  foster  care  and \nadoption  services  that  have  a  disparate  impact  on  Black \nfoster  children  or  have  the  effect  of  defeating  or \nsubstantially  impairing  the  accomplishment  of  the \n58 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 59 of 116\nobjectives  of  such  foster  care  and  adoption  services  for \nBlack  foster  children. \n134.  Questions  of  law  common  to  Plaintiffs  and  their \nputative  subclass  members  include: \na.  Whether  Defendants'  treatment  of  Black  foster \nchildren with  respect  to  the  provision  of  foster  care  or \nadoption  services  constitutes  illegal  discrimination  on \nthe  basis  of  race  or  color  in  violation  of  Tile  VI  of  the \n1964  Civil  Rights  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§  2000d,  et  seq.  and \nthe  regulations  promulgated  under  the  Act;  and \nb.  Whether  the  racially neutral  criteria or  methods \nof  administering  foster  care  and  adoption  services  used \nby  Defendants  have  the  effect  of  illegally discriminating \nagainst  Black  foster  children  on  the  basis  of  race  or \ncolor  in  violation  of  Tile  VI  of  the  1964  Civil  Rights \nAct,  42  U.S.C.  §§  2000d,  et  seq.  and  the  regulations \npromulgated  under  the  Act. \n135.  The  legal  claims  asserted by  Plaintiffs  Paul  B., \nLeslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G., \nMelinda  and  Karina  are  typical  and  representative  of  those  of \nthe  members  of  the  putative  subclass.  The  injuries  these \nPlaintiffs  have  and  continue  to  suffer  are  typical  of  the \ninjuries  the  proposed  subclass  members  have  suffered  and \ncontinue  to  suffer.  Declaratory  and  equitable  relief  addressed \nto  the  putative  subclass  members'  claims  and  injuries  will \n59 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 60 of 116\naddress  equally  the  claims  and  injuries  of  Plaintiffs  Paul  B., \nLeslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G., \nMelinda  and  Karina. \n136.  Plaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie \nS.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and  Karina  will  fairly  and \nadequately  protect  the  interests  of  the  subclass.  They  bring \nthis  action  through  their  well-qualified  representatives, \nincluding  guardians  ad  litem and  next  friends.  They  are \nrepresented  by  geographically  diverse,  competent  counsel \nincluding  board-certified civil  trial  and  appellate  lawyers \nand  attorneys  with  experience  in  class  action  litigation, \nchild  advocacy  and  claims  of  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \nrace  or  color. \n137.  The  Defendants  have  acted  and  refused  to  act  on \ngrounds  generally applicable  to  all  members  of  the  subclass, \nmaking  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  and  corresponding \ndeclaratory  relief  with  respect  to  the  subclass  as  a  whole. \nF.

Violations  of  Foster  Children's \nSubstantive  Due  Process  Rights \n139.  Because  plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members \nare  in  government  custody  and  wholly  dependent  on  the \ngovernment  for  protection  of  all  aspects  of  their  health  and \n60 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 61 of 116\nwell-being,  Defendants  are  obligated  under  the  Due  Process \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution:  to  meet  these  children's  basic  needs  for  food, \nclothing,  shelter,  and  medical,  educational  and  other \nservices,  either by  providing  the  needed  service  or  ensuring \nthe  service  is provided;  to  provide  safe  care  and  a  placement \nthat  protects  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  from \nunnecessary  harm,  injury or  deterioration  and  neither \ncontravenes  accepted  professional  standards  of  social  work \npractice  nor  undermines,  impairs  or  adversely  affects  their \nwell-being,  health,  development  or  education;  to  provide  or \nensure  the  provision  of  the  services  these  children  need  to \nprevent  harm,  injury or  deterioration  from  occurring;  to \nprovide  or  ensure  the  provision  of  the  services,  help  and \nprotection  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  need  to \nameliorate  any  harm,  injury  or  deterioration  caused  or \nexacerbated  by  the  actions  or  inactions  of  Defendants;  to \nprovide  care  to  Plaintiffs  and  their  putative  class  members \nthat,  in  terms  of  their  nature,  conditions  and  duration,  are \nconsistent  with  the  purposes  for  which  Defendants  assumed \ncustody  of  these  children.  In  each  category,  the  required \nservices  and  care  must  be  sufficient  to  provide  a  safe \nenvironment  in which  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members \ndo  not  deteriorate. \n61 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 62 of 116\n140.  Defendants  have  engaged  in  a  pattern  and  practice  of \nfailing  to  fulfill  these  obligations  to  Plaintiffs  and  the \nputative  class  members  in  a  variety  of  ways,  as  described \nbelow.  In  all  such  manifestations,  Defendants  have  acted  to \nthe  detriment  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  as \na  consequence  of  Defendants'  failure  to  exercise  competent \nprofessional  judgment  in  the  decisions  they  make  and  the \nactions  they  take  and  fail  to  take  concerning  these  children. \n141.  The  problems  faced  by  children  in  Defendants' \ncustody  are  both  epidemic  and  long-standing.  The  Defendants \nhave  failed  to  discharge  their  legal  responsibilities  to \nPlaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members.  Indeed,  continued \novercrowding  and  inadequately  supervised  foster  homes  and \nother  out-of-home  care  facilities,  resulting  from  Defendants' \npattern  and  practice  of  not  timely  and  properly moving \nchildren  to  permanency,  expose  children  in  Defendants'  custody \nto  the  imminent  risk  of  sexual  and  other  abuse,  neglect  and \nother  dangers  while  they  remain  in  Defendants'  care. \n142.  Defendants  routinely  fail  to  screen,  oversee, \nmonitor  and  visit  the  foster  and  pre-adoptive  homes  and  foster \nand  shelter  facilities  in  which  they  place  Plaintiffs  and \nmembers  of  the  putative  class.  Defendants,  in  fact,  operate \nthe  foster  care  system  with  a  much  greater  tolerance  for  child \nabuse  committed  by  their own  foster  parents,  group  home \nparents  and  institutional  personnel  than  by  children's \n62 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 63 of 116\nbiological  families.  Defendants  have,  as  part  of  a  pattern  and \npractice,  knowingly  placed  and  retained  Plaintiffs  Tanya  M., \nHugh  S.,  Sandra  M.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Elaine  R.,  Paul \nB.,  Matthew  I.,  Rachel,  Reggie  B.,  John  J.,  Leanne  G.,  Tammy \nG.,  Cathy  W.,  Melinda  and  Karina,  Sandra  M.,  Leslie  F., \nLarissa,  and  other members  of  Plaintiffs'  putative  class,  in \nfoster  care  placements  that  were  dangerous,  abusive, \nneglectful,  overcrowded,  or  wholly  inappropriate  to  and \nincapable  of meeting  the  children's  individual  needs. \n143.  Defendants  have  a  pattern and  practice  of  ignoring \nor  inappropriately  responding  to  complaints  and  other \ninformation  identifying  individual  foster,  shelter  and  pre \nadoptive  placements  as  dangerous,  abusive,  neglectful, \novercrowded  or  inappropriate  for  specific  children  in \nDefendants'  custody,  including  complaints  concerning  the \nplacements  of  Plaintiffs  Tanya  M.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S., \nMatthew  I.,  Tammy  G.,  John  J.,  and  Leslie  F.,  and  other \nmembers  of  the  putative  class. \n144.  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  placing  children \nin  their  custody  into  dangerous  and  overcrowded  foster  care \nsettings  and  failing  to  respond  adequately  to  complaints  about \nsuch  placements  violate  accepted  professional  standards,  do \nnot  represent  the  exercise  of  competent  professional  judgment, \nare  inconsistent  with  the  purpose  for  which  the  children were \ntaken  into  Defendants'  custody,  have  caused  and  continue  to \n63 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 64 of 116\ncause  Plaintiffs  and  their  putative  class  members  serious \ninjury,  and  are  known  to  Defendants,  who  through  their \ndeliberate  indifference  have  failed  to  remedy  them. \n145.  In  January  1995,  a  Grand  Jury  in  Palm  Beach  County \nreleased  a  report,  finding  that:  ~children alleged  to  be \nabused,  neglected  or  abandoned  in  Palm  Beach  County  are  at \nsignificant  risk  for  further  abuse  if they  are  taken  into  the \ncustody  of  the  Department  of  Health  and  Rehabilitative \nServices.\"  (January  13,  1995  Grand  Jury  Report,  p.  1.) [The \nDepartment  of  Health  and  Rehabilitative  Services  is  DCAF's \npredecessor  agency] . \n146.  A  major  contributing  factor  to  the  placement  and \nretention  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  in \ndangerous,  abusive,  neglectful,  overcrowded  and  inappropriate \nplacements  is  the  large  workload  of  Defendants'  caseworkers, \ntheir  high  level  of  turnover,  and  the  lack  of  adequate  and \nmeaningful  supervision,  training  and management  of  the \ncaseworkers,  all  of  which  lead  to  inadequate  supervision  and \noversight  of  children  in  Defendants'  custody. \n147.  In  a  budget  document  Defendants  prepared  for  FY2000-\n0l,  they  project  that  they  need  an  additional  833  DCAF  out-of \nhome  counselors  to  meet  the  professionally  accepted  workload \nstandard  for  this  type  of  caseworker.  DCAF  out-of-home \ncounselors  supervise  and  provide  services  to  children  and \ntheir  families  while  the  children  are  in  foster  care  or \n64 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 65 of 116\nrelative placements  and  during  the  first  six  months  following \na  child's  reunification  with  the  biological  family. \nDefendants,  however,  have  requested  funding  for  only  104  out \nof-home  counselors  (12.5%  of  the  need  as  calculated by \nDefendants).  Similarly,  they  are  seeking  only  half  the  needed \nincrease  in both  non-supervisory  support  personnel,  whose \nfunctions  are  essential  to  the  efficient  use  of  the  out-of \nhorne  counselors,  and  family  support  workers,  who  are  intended \nto  free  the  out-of-home  counselors  to  concentrate  on  their \nprimary mission  of  working  with  the  child,  parents  and  foster \nparents  to  achieve  permanency  for  the  child.  (Budget  Document, \nat  152-156.) \n148.  As  a  result  of  excessive  workloads,  Defendants'  out \nof-home  counselors  do  not  visit  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative \nclass  members  in  their placements  with  sufficient  frequency  or \nin  a  manner  that  is  adequate  to  ensure  such  children's  safety. \n' \nSuch  failure  contravenes  accepted  professional  standards,  does \nnot  represent  the  exercise  of  competent  professional  judgment, \nhas  harmed  and  continues  to  harm  Plaintiffs  Jay  D.  and  Candice \nD.  and  other  putative  class  members.  Defendants  permit  this \npractice  of  failing  to  visit  and  supervise  children  in  out-of \nhome  placement  to  continue  as  a  result  of  their  deliberate \nindifference  to  the  children's  need  for  safety. \n149.  Also  significantly contributing  to  the  placements \nand  retention of  Plaintiffs  and  their putative  class  members \n65 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 66 of 116\nin  dangerous,  abusive,  overcrowded,  neglectful  or \ninappropriate  placements  is  Defendants'  failure  to  develop, \nand  the  resulting  lack  of  a  sufficient  number  and  array of \nplacements,  to  facilitate  Defendants'  selection  of  a  safe  and \nappropriate  placement  for  each  child  in  their  custody. \nDefendants  are  fully  aware  of  the  lack  of  an  adequate  number \nand  array  of  appropriate  placement  and  have  acted  with \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  plaintiffs'  and  class members' \nneed  for  safe  and  appropriate  placements. \n150.  Defendants  have  knowingly  engaged  in  a  pattern  and \npractice  of  placing  some  foster  children,  including  Plaintiffs \nLeslie  F.,  Sandra  M.,  Rachel  C.,  Paul  B.,  Hugh  S.  and  Tammy \nG.,  on  a  long-term  basis  in  a  temporary  shelter  or  in  a  group \nplacement  because  of  the  unavailability  of  a  foster  home  that \nwill  accept  the  child.  These  placements  are  inappropriate, \ncontravene  competent  professional  judgment,  and  have  harmed \nand  continue  to  harm  these  Plaintiffs  and  other  class  members. \n151.  While  Defendants  have  failed  to  develop  an  array  of \nfoster  care  settings  in  sufficient  numbers  to  ensure  a  safe  and \nsecure  placement  for  each  foster  child,  this  deficiency  is \nparticularly glaring  with  respect  to  certain  types  of \nplacements.  Among  these  are  foster  homes  for  large  sibling \ngroups  and  teenagers.  DCAF  has  recognized  the  need  to  focus  its \nrecruitment  efforts  on  these  types  of  placements  [Defendants' \n66 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 67 of 116\nweb  site,  www.state.fl.us/cfweb/fs/fostercare/issues.html],  but  has  failed  to  take \nadequate  and  reasonable  steps  to  address  this  acknowledged  need. \n152.  As  a  result  of  the  lack  of  foster  homes  for  large \nsibling  groups,  Defendants  unnecessarily  separated  Plaintiffs \nTanya  M.,  Reggie  B.  and  Rebecca  B.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S., \nTammy  G  and  Leanne  G.,  Leslie  F.,  Elaine  R.,  and  Melinda  and \nKarina  and  other  class  members  from  their  siblings.  As  a \nresult  of  a  lack  of  foster  homes  and  other  placements  for \nteens,  Plaintiff  HughS.  Paul  B.,  Rachel  C.,  Sandra  M.,  Tanya \nM.,  Leslie  F.,  Melinda  and  Karina  and  other  class  members  have \nbeen  placed  in  dangerous  and  wholly  inappropriate  placements. \nDefendants'  failure  to  recruit,  develop  and  maintain  a \nsufficient  number  of  foster  homes  for  large  sibling  groups, \nteenagers,  and  other  groups  of  foster  children who  have  a \nforeseeable  need  for  earmarked  foster  homes  violates  accepted \nprofessional  standards,  has  harmed  and  continues  to  harm \nPlaintiffs  Tanya  M.,  Reggie  B.  and  Rebecca  B.,  Laurie  S.  and \nLillie S.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Leslie  F.,  Elaine  R.,  Melinda \nand  Karina  and  Hugh  S.  and  other  class  and  members. \n153.  Defendants  know  Plaintiffs  and  their  putative  class \nmembers  have  been  and  continue  to  be  placed  and  retained  in \ndangerous,  abusive,  overcrowded,  neglectful  or  inappropriate \nplacements  but  have  failed  to  address  or  remedy  that  practice \nor  the  underlying  actions  and  inactions  that  cause  or \nsignificantly contribute  to  it. \n67 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 68 of 116\n154.  In  Defendants'  budget  document,  they  state: \nThere  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the  need \nfor  out  of  home  care  placement  options  for \nchildren who  have  been  identified as  victims  of \nchild  abuse  or  neglect.  Over  the  next  two  years \nthe  department  is  expecting  continued  increases \nin  the  number  of  children  requiring  out  of  home \ncare  placements.  There  has  not  been  a  parallel \nincrease  in  the  number  of  available  foster  homes \nor  specialized  group  homes  for  children  who  need \nto  be  placed  out  of  their  homes.  This  has \nresulted  in  over-crowded  conditions  in  current \nfoster  homes  and  other  related  facilities.  This \nhas  caused  some  districts  to  pay  for  children  and \nstaff  to  be  housed  in motels.  The  overcrowding  of \nfoster  homes  places  children  at  serious  risk  of \nbeing  harmed  by  other  children;  places \nunrealistic  expectations  for  care  and  supervision \non  foster  parents;  and  ultimately  leads  to  their \nrapid  turnover. \nFoster  homes  are  also  overcrowded  because  the  population \nneeding  placement  continues  to  rise,  in  part,  because \nDefendants  fail  to  achieve  adoption  or  other  type  of  discharge \nexpeditiously  for  the  children  already  in  foster  care. \n155.  Even  if Defendants  are  able  to  develop  the  needed \nout-of-home  placements,  they will  not  have  an  adequate  number \nof  out-of-horne  counselors  and  supervisors  to  supervise  and \nserve  the  children  in  these  placements.  Defendants  will, \ntherefore,  continue  to  fail  to  fulfill  their  obligation  to \nprotect  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  putative  class. \nGiven  the  out-of-home  counselors'  workload,  it will  simply  be \nimpossible  to  supervise  these  children's  placements \nadequately. \n68 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 69 of 116\n156.  Children  require  stability and  to  grow  and \nse~urity \ndevelop.  It  is  contrary  to  sound  professional  judgment  to  move \na  child  from  foster  care  placement  to  foster  care  placement \nexcept  in  extraordinary  circumstances  when  the  movement  is \nneeded  to  protect  the  child  from  harm  or  to  provide  a \nspecialized placement  that  is  designed  to meet  the  child's \nspecific  needs.  Multiple moves,  including  night-to-night \nplacements,  and  sleeping  in motels  instead of  houses  are \nneedlessly,  inescapably  traumatic  to  a  child,  undermining  the \nchild's  stability and  security,  and  causing  the  child  to \nsuffer  an  injury. \n157.  Defendants  have  a  pattern and  practice  of  moving \nchildren  in  their  custody  repeatedly  in  contravention  of \ncompetent  professional  judgment  and  have  knowingly  permitted \nthis  practice  to  continue  as  a  result  of  their  deliberate \nindifference  to  the  children's  need  for  a  safe,  stable  and \nappropriate  placement.  In  some  cases,  these  moves  have  been \ncaused by  Defendants'  initial  failure  to  exercise  professional \njudgment  that  resulted  in  the  child's  placement  in  a \ndangerous,  abusive,  neglectful,  overcrowded  or  inappropriate \nfoster  home  or  facility,  from  which  the  child  then  had  to  be \nremoved.  This  pattern  and  practice  of  subjecting  children  in \nDefendants'  custody  to  multiple,  unwarranted  placements  has \ninjured  Plaintiffs  Tanya  M.,  HughS.,  Sandra  M.,  Laurie  S.  and \nLillie  S.,  Reggie  B.  Tammy  G.,  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Jay  D.  and \n69 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 70 of 116\nCandice  D.,  Melinda  and  Karina,  and  Bonnie  L.,  and  other \nmembers  of  the  putative  class. \n158.  A  factor  that  contributes  to  Defendants'  repeated \nreplacement  of  foster  children  into  new  settings  is \nDefendants'  lack  of  an  efficient  and  competent  mechanism  or \nprocedure  for  locating  vacant  foster  care  beds,  identifying \nthe  characteristics  of  the  children  for  whom  the  foster  homes \nand  facilities  with  vacancies  would  be  appropriate,  matching \nthe  children  in  need  of  a  placement  with  appropriate \nvacancies,  and  expeditiously placing  each  child  in  an \nappropriate  placement.  Defendants  are  fully  aware  of  the  lack \nof  such  a  process,  but  have  not  remedied  this  deficiency  as  a \nresult  of  their  deliberate  indifference  to  the  children's  need \nfor  a  safe,  stable  and  appropriate  placement.  The  absence  of  a \nmechanism  for  identifying  settings  that  are  appropriate  for \neach  child  in  need  of  a  placement  contravenes  professional \nstandards  and  precludes  Defendants  from  exercising  competent \nprofessional  judgment  in  selecting placements  for  children  in \ntheir  custody.  Plaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Tanya  M.,  Cathy  W.,  Sandra \nM.,  Rachel  C.  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Hughs.,  Reggie  B.  and \nLeslie  F.  and  other  putative  class  members  have  been  or  will \nbe  placed  in  inappropriate placements,  requiring  subsequent \nreplacement,  and  have  been  or  will  be  harmed  as  a  result. \n159.  Defendants  often move  children  to  a  new  placement \nbecause  the  foster  parent  has  demanded  the  child's  removal, \n70 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 71 of 116\nfrequently  because  of  the  child's  allegedly disruptive \nbehavior.  Children  who  have  undergone  abuse  or  neglect  that  is \nsufficiently serious  to  require  their  removal  from  their \nbiological  families  have  suffered  such  great  trauma  that \ndisruptive  behavior  can  be  expected  from  them.  Indeed, \nDefendants  recognized  this  in  their  Budget  Document: \nMany  children  placed  in  foster  care  display \nserious,  chronic  and  disruptive  behaviors  as  a \nresult  of  the  trauma  and  loss  they  have \nexperienced.  Foster  parents  need  techniques  and \ntools  to  help  them manage  these  extremely \ndifficult  behaviors.  Foster  parents  frequently \nrequest  that  children be  removed  from  their  homes \nbecause  of  the  children's  disruptive  behaviors. \n(Budget  Document,  at  156) . \n160.  Defendants  violate  accepted  professional  standards \nby  failing  to  prepare  foster  parents  to  deal  with  the \npredictable  behavior  of  the  children  placed  in  their  homes, \nalthough  Defendants  have  foreseen  both  this  type  of  behavior \nI \nand  how  it undermines  the  stability of  placements,  and  by \nfailing  to  support  the  foster  parents  with  services  and  other \ntypes  of  help  to  make  it possible  for  the  child  to  be \nmaintained  in  the  foster  home.  Defendants  have  thus  acted with \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  children's  need  for  safe, \nstable  and  appropriate  placements.  This  deficiency  has  harmed \nand  continues  to  harm  Plaintiffs  Sandra  M.,  Tanya  M.,  Reggie \nB.,  and  Leslie  F.,  and  other members  of  the  putative  class. \n71 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 72 of 116\n161.  Defendants  also  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of \nfailing  to  identify  relatives  who  are  competent  and  willing  to \nprovide  safe  and  appropriate  care  for  children  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  If  Defendants  assessed  and  utilized  these  capable \nfamily  members  as  placement  resources,  instead of  ignoring  or \nactively discouraging  relatives  (which  is  currently  the  case), \nDefendants  would:  partially  relieve  the  overcrowding  in \nexisting  out-of-home  placements;  avoid  placing  children  in \ndangerous,  abusive,  neglectful  or  inappropriate  placements; \nprovide  the  children placed with  relatives  with  the  most \nappropriate  care  available;  and  facilitate  the  placement  of \nsiblings  together  and  foster  children's  visitation with  their \nseparated  siblings.  It would  also  increase  the  likelihood  that \nthe  children would  expeditiously  achieve  permanent  placements \nand  be  provided  with  permanent  families. \n162.  Defendants  have  injured  Plaintiffs  Laurie  S.  and \nLillie  S.,  Reggie  B.  and  Rebecca  B.,  John  J.,  Bonnie  L.,  and \nother  members  of  the  putative  class  by  ignoring  or  actively \ndiscouraging  possible  relative placements  and,  instead, \nplacing  these  children  into  dangerous,  abusive,  neglectful  or \novercrowded  stranger-placements  that  were  not  appropriate  and \ncould  not  meet  these  children's  individual  needs.  This \npractice  violates  accepted  professional  standards  and  does  not \nreflect  the  exercise  of  competent  professional  judgment. \nDefendants,  moreover,  know  of  both  the  insufficiency of  the \n72 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 73 of 116\nnumber  and  array  of  out-of-home  placements  available  to  care \nfor  the  children  in  their  custody  and  the  policy  and  practice \nof  failing  to  use  relatives  or  discouraging  them  from  being \nfoster  or  adoptive  resources.  Defendants  have  acted  with \ndeliberate  indifference  to  Plaintiffs'  and  the  putative  class \nmembers'  need  for  appropriate  and  safe  placements. \n163.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  excluding \nfrom  the  decision-making  process  concerning  individual  foster \nchildren,  the  foster  children  themselves  and  some  responsible \nadults  who  are  deeply  involved  with  the  children  and  possess \ncritically important  information  about  them.  This  practice \nviolates  accepted  professional  standards,  is  outside  the  scope \nof  professional  judgment  and  defies  logic.  It has  injured \nPlaintiffs  Jay  D.  and  Candice  D.,  Melinda,  and  Bonnie  L.  and \nother  putative  class  members  by  depriving  them  of  even  the \npossibility  that  Defendants  will  engage  in  fully  informed  and \ncompetent  decision-making  concerning  matters  that  are  critical \nto  the  children's  well-being  and  development.  Defendants  know \nof  this  pattern  and  practice  and  its detrimental  effect  on  the \nlife-altering  decisions  made  concerning  children  in  their \ncustody,  but  have  been  deliberately  indifferent  to  its \nexistence  and  effect  on  children  and  have  failed  to  stop  it \nfrom  occurring. \n164.  Defendants  routinely  fail  to  provide  children  in \ntheir  custody  with  needed  medical  care  for  acute,  chronic  and \n73 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 74 of 116\ncongenital  conditions  or  with  treatment  prescribed by  a \nphysician.  This  pattern  and  practice,  which  is  known  to \nDefendants,  contravenes  accepted  professional  standards  and \nreflects  both  a  failure  to  exercise  professional  judgment  and \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  medical  needs  of  Plaintiffs  and \nthe  putative  class  members.  Defendants  have  thereby  injured \nand  continue  to  injure  Plaintiffs Matthew  I.,  Reggie  B.  and \nLeanne  G.  and  other members  of  the  putative  class. \n165.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  allowing \nchildren  in  their  custody  and  care  to  be  subjected  to  the \nadministration  of  psychotropic  medications  for  the  purpose  of \nmaking  it more  convenient  and  easier  to  care  for  these \nchildren  in  an  out-of-home  setting,  rather  than  for  the \nimprovement  of  the  child's mental  or  emotional  health.  The \nadministration  of  such mind-altering  drugs  for  a  non \ntherapeutic  purpose  unreasonably  and  unnecessarily  restrains \nthese  children's  liberty and  contravenes  accepted  professional \npractice.  Defendants  have  undertaken  this  practice  without  the \nexercise  of  professional  judgment  and  with  deliberate \nindifference  to  the  health  and  well  being  of  the  affected \nchildren.  Plaintiffs Melinda  and  Karina  and  other  members  of \nthe  putative  class  have  been  subjected  to  this  practice,  which \nis  known  to  Defendants  and  these  children,  have  suffered \nserious  injuries  as  a  result. \n74 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 75 of 116\n166.  Defendants  systematically deprive  children  in  their \ncustody  of  access  to  an  education.  As  a  consequence  of  moving \nchildren  from  one  placement  to  another,  children's  education \nis  interrupted  and  impaired.  Defendants  do  not  monitor  the \neducational  performance  of  children  in  their  custody  to \ndetermine  whether  the  child's  educational  performance  is \ndeteriorating or  the  child  requires  assistance  in  meeting \neducational  goals.  Defendants  also  routinely  fail  to  provide \neducational  assistance  when  a  child  in  their  custody  needs  it. \nDefendants  do  not  ensure  that  children  in  foster  care  who  have \nspecial  educational  needs  have  those  educational  needs  met. \nThe  denial  and  interruption  of  the  education  of  Plaintiffs \nHughS.,  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Melinda,  Karina  and  other  members \nof  the  putative  class  have  resulted  from  Defendants'  failure \nto  exercise  competent  professional  judgment.  Defendants  are \naware  of  these  systemic  failings,  but  have  acted  with \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  children's  educational  needs, \nthereby  seriously  injuring  these  children. \n167.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  failing  to \nprovide  children  in  their  custody  with  adequate  clothing  or  a \ntimely  paid  clothing  allowance,  and  as  a  result  children  in \nDefendants'  custody  are  deprived  of  adequate  and  season \nappropriate  clothing.  Defendants'  Budget  Document  states: \nannual  inflation,  the  clothing  allowance  has  not  been \n~Despite \nchanged  in  six  years.  The  current  clothing  allowance  is \n75 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 76 of 116\ncritically insufficient.\"  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \nfailing  to  provide  Plaintiff Hugh  S.  and  other  members  of  the \nputative  class  with  adequate  clothing  injures  these  children, \ndeprives  them  of  a  basic  need,  violates  accepted  professional \nstandards.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  foster  children with \nadequate  clothing because  they  do  not  exercise  professional \njudgment  in  determining  how  to  meet  foster  children's  basic \nneeds  and  they  are  deliberately  indifferent  to  those  needs. \n168.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  attempting \nto  reunify  foster  children  with  their  biological  families  when \ndoing  so  remains  obviously  dangerous  to  the  child.  Defendants' \nobligation  to  prevent  children  in  their  custody  from  being \nharmed  encompasses  the  decision  whether  it  is  safe  to  return  a \nchild  to  the  biological  family,  as  well  as  the  decision  to \nplace  a  child  in  a  particular  foster,  shelter  or  pre-adoptive \nplacement. \n169.  Based  on  Defendants'  own  data,  during  the  period \ncovering  the  fourth  quarter  of  FY98-99  through  the  second \nquarter  of  FY99-00,  only  23.9%  of  the  children  in  a  licensed \nhome  or  group  care  facility who  exited  foster  care  did  not  re \nenter  foster  care  within  twelve  months.  Thus,  76.1%  of  these \nchildren  did  re-enter  government  custody within  twelve  months, \nindicating  their biological  families  pose  an  immediate  danger \nto  their  safety,  health  or  well  being.  Defendants'  performance \n(23.9%)  fell  far  short  of  Florida's  own  standard  that  over  95% \n76 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 77 of 116\nof  the  children  should  not  reenter  foster  care  within  twelve \nmonths,  as  well  as  the  State's  interim  goal  that  70%  of  the \nchildren  should  not  reenter  care.  Every  DCAF  district  was \nidentified as  \"Attention Needed\"  on  this  performance \nindicator.  (Florida  Department  of  Children  and  Families, \n\"April  2000  Situation  Report,\"  Table  FSP-026). \n170.  Defendants'  decision  that  these  putative  class \nmembers  should be  discharged  from  foster  care  created  a  known \nand  imminent  danger  to  them,  was  contrary  to  competent \nprofessional  judgment,  was  undertaken  with  deliberate \nindifference  to  the  children's  safety,  and  caused  these \nchildren  serious  injury.  Moreover,  every  Plaintiff,  with  the \npossible  exception  of  Melinda,  and  every  putative  class  member \ncurrently  in  Defendants'  custody  are  at  immediate  risk  that \nDefendants  will  decide  they  should  be  discharged  home  without \n' \nan  adequate  assessment  of  the  safety  of  the  parental  home. \n171.  Children  are  placed  into  Defendants'  custody  in \norder  to  provide  them  with  temporary  care  that  is  safe  and \nappropriate  because  their biological  families  are  unable  or \nunwilling  to  do  so.  Except  in  extremely  rare  situations, \nretaining  children  in  government  custody  for  long  periods  of \ntheir  childhood  is  not  reasonably  related  to  the  reason  the \nchildren  were  taken  into  government  custody  and  is  contrary  to \ncompetent  professional  judgment. \n77 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 78 of 116\n172.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  retaining \nchildren  in  foster  care  for  longer  periods  than  is  necessary \nor  appropriate.  Plaintiffs  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Sandra  M., \nHughs.  Reggie  B.  and  Rebecca  B.,  Melinda  and  Karina,  Bonnie \nL.,  Jay  D.  and  Candice  D.,  Leslie  F.  and  other members  of  the \nputative  class  have  been  held  in  foster  care  for  an \nunnecessarily  long  period of  time,  have  thereby  been  deprived \nof  an  opportunity  for  a  permanent  family,  and  have  been \nseriously and  permanently  injured.  Defendants  have  retained \nthese  children  in  foster  care  for  excessive  amounts  of  time \nbecause  they  have  failed  to  exercise  professional  judgment  in \nidentifying  and  implementing  the  reasonable  steps  needed  to \ndischarge  these  children  to  an  appropriate  permanent  living \narrangement  with  their biological  family,  through  adoption  or \notherwise. \n173.  Not  only  does  an  extended  stay  in  \"temporary\"  foster \ncare  harm  a  child by  depriving  him  or  her  of  the  stability and \nsupport  of  a  permanent  family,  but,  as  Defendants  know,  the \nlonger  children  are  in  foster  care:  the  less  likely  they  are \nto  be  adopted;  the  more  likely  they  are  to  be  abused  by  their \nDCAF-approved  custodians  or  others  in  the  DCAF-selected \nplacements;  the  more  likely  they  are  to  be  moved  into  new \nplacements  and  consequently  into  new  schools,  disrupting  both \ntheir  development  and  education;  and  the  more  likely  they  are \nto  become  truant,  delinquent,  or  both.  Each  of  these \n78 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 79 of 116\nconsequences  has  caused  or  will  cause  additional  injury  to \nPlaintiffs  Hugh  S.,  Paul  B.,  Rachel  C.,  Cathy  W.,  Melinda, \nKarina  and  other  putative  class  members.  Additionally \nDefendants'  practice  of  keeping  children  in  foster  care  for \nunreasonably  long  and  harmful  periods  of  time  causes  the \nfoster  care  population  to  increase,  resulting  in  even  further \novercrowding  and  greater  risk  of  harm. \n174.  According  to  Defendants'  own  data,  dependent \nchildren  in  licensed  homes  and  group  homes  as  of  May  2000 \nremained  in  Florida  foster  care  for  an  average  of  33.8  months. \nIn  Miami-Dade  County,  the  average  length  of  stay was  55 \nmonths.  For  Florida's  foster  children,  the  average  length  of \nstay  exceeds  the  12  month  standard  recognized  by  the  state, \nand  the  longer  18-month  federal  standard.  As  of  May  2000,  only \n28.7%  of  the  dependent  children  in  licensed  foster  homes  and \ngroup  care  left  Defendants'  custody  within  the  twelve  month \ntime  frame  adopted  by  the  State  of  Florida.  In  Miami-Dade \nCounty,  only  11.4%  of  the  foster  children  exited  care  within \ntwelve  months.  Conversely,  Defendants  have  recognized  that \nhaving  72%  of  the  children  exit  care  within  twelve  months  is \nthe  federal  target  and  80%  constitutes  \"good\"  performance.  The \nabysmal  result  of  the  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \nneedlessly  keeping  foster  children  in  custody  for  longer  than \nthe  pertinent  federal  and  state  time  limits  is  evident  from \nthe  Defendants  labeling  all  the  districts  as \n~Attention \n79 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 80 of 116\nNeeded\"  on  this  indicator.  (Florida  Department  of  Children \nand  Families,  \"April  2000  Situation  Report,\"  Tables  FSP-003, \nFSP-027) . \n175.  When  a  child  is  first  removed  from  the  biological \nfamily,  accepted  professional  judgment  requires  in most  cases \nthat  Defendants  provide  necessary  services  to  the  biological \nfamily  to  attempt  to  facilitate  reunification,  assuming  the \nparents  are  alive  and  their whereabouts  are  known.  In  most \ncases,  this  requires  the  assessment  of  the  biological  family's \nneeds  and  provision  of  services  designed  to  ameliorate  the \nproblems  that  necessitated  the  child's  placement.  Unless \nDefendants  make  some  attempt  to  facilitate  reunification, \ntheir  efforts  to  move  the  child  to  permanency  through  adoption \nmay  be  precluded  or  significantly delayed,  even  when  adoption \nappears  to  be  the  only  avenue  to  permanency  open  to  the  child. \nDefendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  failing  to  provide \nthe  services  needed  by  the  biological  families  of  children  in \nout-of-home  care,  delaying  reunification  even  where  it is \nappropriate. \n176.  If  reunification with  the  child's  biological  family \ncannot  be  safely accomplished  within  a  reasonable  amount  of \ntime,  accepted  professional  standards  require  the  government \nfoster  care  agency  to  secure  an  alternative  permanent  family \nfor  the  child,  either with  a  relative  or  through  adoption. \nWhen  adoption  is  the  appropriate  approach  to  achieving \n80 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 81 of 116\npermanency,  Defendants  must  petition  for  termination  of \nparental  rights  and,  concurrently  locate  and  approve  a \nqualified  and  appropriate  adoptive  family.  Failing  to  take \nthese  steps  when  adoption  is  appropriate  does  not  represent \ncompetent  professional  judgment,  deprives  the  child of  a  real \nfamily  and  causes  a  permanent  and  serious  injury  to  the  child. \n177.  Defendants'  most  recent  available  data  show  that  for \nFY1998-99,  only  68.2%  of  the  children  eligible  for  adoption \nwere  actually  adopted,  although  the  State's  own  standard was \n90%.  [Defendants  asserted  that  \"about  88%  is  an  upper  limit  on \nthis  measure  in  Floridau].  As  poor  as  Defendants'  performance \nis  on  this  measure,  it deceptively  does  not  take  into  account \nthe  thousands  of  children who  should be  available  for  adoption \nbut  for  whom  Defendants  have  as  yet  failed  to  take  the  steps \nneeded  first  to  change  their permanency  goal  and  then  to  free \nthem  for  adoption.  Defendants  further  stated  that  the \nI \nfor  this  measure  includes  many  children who  have \n~denominator \nnot  yet  been  placed  and  some  who  will  never  be  placed.u \n(Florida  Department  of  Children  and  Families,  'Summary  Report \nof  FY1998-1999  Performance  Based  on  Exhibit  D-2A,u  (August  31, \n1999),  at  10.  (Emphasis  supplied). \n178.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  too \nquickly  giving  up  on  finding  adoptive  families  for  children \nwho  cannot  be  returned  to  their  biological  families  or  placed \npermanently  with  a  relative.  Plaintiffs  Bonnie  L.  and  Sandra \n81 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 82 of 116\nM.  and  other  members  of  the  putative  class  have  been  and \ncontinue  to  be  seriously harmed  by  this  practice,  which  is \nwell  known  to  Defendants. \n179.  For  years,  Defendants  have  attempted  to  excuse  or \njustify their  failure  to  comply  with  accepted  professional \nstandards  concerning  the  inappropriateness  of  keeping  children \nin  government  custody  for  extended  periods  of  time  by  claiming \nnot  to  be  able  to  find  adequate  adoptive  homes,  or  sufficient \nfoster  homes  for  that  matter.  For  thousands  of  children, \nDefendants  do  not  even  look  for  families.  Defendants, \nmoreover,  wait  such  an  unacceptably  long  time  to  begin  to \nconsider  and  work  toward  adoption  that  the  children  have  been \nseriously  damaged  by  their  foster  care  experience,  making  it \nincreasingly  difficult  to  find  adoptive  homes  willing  and  able \nto  care  for  them. \nThis  pattern  and  practice  has  been  identified  and \ncondemned  by  many  over  the  years,  including  the  1978  Dade \nCounty  Grand  Jury,  yet  still shamefully  continues  without \ninterruption.  Defendants'  perception  that  it is  impossible  to \nrecruit  a  sufficient  number  of  adoptive  homes  has  resulted  in \nfoster  children being  deprived  of  their  right  to  Defendants' \nprofessionally  competent  efforts  to  seek  and  obtain  a \npermanent,  legally  secure  family  for  them.  Further,  if the \nsystem  had  functioned  properly  since  Defendant  Bush's \nAdministration  took  office  in  January  1999,  the  thousands  of \n82 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 83 of 116\nchildren  who  have  remained  in  foster  care  too  long  would  no \nlonger  be  in  Defendants'  custody,  but  would  be  children  living \nwith  loving,  stable,  permanent  families.  Instead,  a \nsignificant  number  of  children  in  Defendants'  custody  today \n[the majority]  were  already  in  custody  in  January  1999;  most \nappear  no  closer  to  permanency  than  they  were  in  January  1999. \n180.  In  order  to  achieve  permanency  for  foster  children \nmore  expeditiously,  Defendants  have  identified  their  need  for \nadditional  DCAF  lawyers  and  legal  support  staff.  Defendants \nexpect  this  additional  legal  staff  to  increase  the  initiation \nand  prosecution  of  termination  of  parental  rights  proceedings \nand  generally  to  speed  children's  transit  through  the  foster \ncare  system.  The  end  product  of  achieving  these  goals  would  be \nto  improve  the  children's  lives  and  decrease  the  foster  care \npopulation,  thus  relieving  some  of  the  overcrowding  in \nplacements.  To  accomplish  these  purposes,  Defendants  found \nthey  need  to  add  497  attorneys,  248  paralegals,  and  124 \nsecretaries.  Defendants,  however,  only  asked  for  funding  for \n25%  of  the  unmet  needs:  60  attorneys,  28  paralegals  and  16 \nsecretaries.  [Budget  Document,  at  148].  Similarly,  in \nconnection  with  the  request  for  additional  out-of-home \ncounselors,  Defendants  stated,  ~the fact  that  there  is  a \nsevere  shortage  of  staff  limits  the  Defendants'  ability  to  be \ntotally successful\"  in  ~find[ing]  alternatives  to  placing \nchildren  in  out  of  home  care  and  to  reducing  the  length  of \n83 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 84 of 116\ntime  children  remain  in  care.\"  [Id.,  at  152].  Yet,  Defendants \nasked  for  only  12.5%  (104  of  833)  of  the  unmet  need  for  these \ncritically important  workers.  [Id]. \n181.  Defendants  clearly  know  children  are  languishing  in \nDefendants'  custody  rather  than  being  moved  toward  having \npermanent,  legally stable  families  of  their  own,  despite \nestablished professional  standards  that  such  childhood-long \ngovernment  custody  is  harmful  to  children  and  must  be \nprevented  except  in  the  rarest  of  cases.  They  have,  however, \nfailed  to  take  meaningful  steps  to  ameliorate  this  long \nstanding  pattern  and  practice  that  violates  the  rights  of \nPlaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members.  Defendants  have \nacted  with  deliberate  indifference  to  the  need  of  each  child \nfor  a  safe,  legally  stable  permanent  home. \n182.  A  young  person  between  the  ages  of  18  and  21  years \nmay,  in  some  cases,  be  allowed  to  remain  in  Defendants' \ncustody.  Defendants'  decisions  concerning  which  individuals \nwill  be  permitted  to  remain  in  foster  care  past  their  18th \nbirthday  are  arbitrary,  capricious  and  fundamentally  unfair. \nDefendants,  in  fact,  simply  decide  that  some  youngsters  will \nbe  able  to  extend  their  stay  in  foster  care  while  others  will \nnot. \n183.  Defendants'  decision  not  to  permit  an  individual  to \nremain  in  foster  care  after  reaching  17  years  of  age  can  and, \nfor  many  young  people  does,  create  an  immediate,  known  and \n84 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 85 of 116\nunnecessary  danger  to  the  individual  because  of  the  young \nperson's  inability  to  live  independently  without  the \nprotection  and  support  of  the  government  custodian.  Many  of \nthese  youngsters,  including  Plaintiffs  Leslie  F.  and  Melinda, \nhave  been  in  foster  care  for  much  of  their  childhood  because \nDefendants  never  arranged  a  permanent  family  placement  for \nthem,  and  consequently,  they  have  no  family  or  other  adults  on \nwhom  they  can  rely  for  financial  and  other  support  once  they \nleave  foster  care.  Also  like  Plaintiffs  Leslie  F.  and  Melinda, \nmany  of  these  young  people  have  educational  and  other \ndeficiencies  and  problems  that  were  caused  or  exacerbated by \nDefendants'  actions  and  omissions,  which  have  rendered  these \nyoungsters  unable  to  live  independently  upon  reaching  their \nmajority. \n184.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of making \narbitrary  and  capricious  decisions  concerning  which  foster \nchildren  will  be  allowed  to  remain  in  Defendants'  custody \nafter  their  18th  birthday.  These  decisions  have  deprived  or \nimminently  threaten  to  deprive  Plaintiffs  Leslie  F.  and \nMelinda  and  other  putative  class  members  of  an  important \ngovernment  benefit  and  to  place  them  in  unnecessary,  immediate \nand  foreseeable  danger  created by  Defendants'  decision  to \ndischarge  them  from  care,  causing  them  serious  and  irreparable \ninjury. \n85 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 86 of 116\n185.  Defendants  operate  a  subsidized  Independent  Living \nProgram  that  pays  directly  to  a  child  16  years  of  age  or  older \nthe  foster  care  maintenance  payment  usually paid  to  a  foster \ncare  provider  (foster  parent  or  agency)  to  allow  the  youngster \nto  live  in  an  unlicensed  setting  independent  of  daily \nsupervision of  a  responsible  adult  but  under  the  on-going \nsupervision of  a  DCAF  caseworker  or  other  adult  approved  by \nDCAF.  These  benefits  can  continue  past  the  youngster's  18th \nbirthday.  Defendants'  decisions  concerning  which  individuals \nwill  be  permitted  to  participate  in  the  subsidized  Independent \nLiving  Program  are  made  without  full  information  from  the \nchild as  well  as  persons  with  knowledge  of  the  child  and  are \narbitrary,  capricious  and  fundamentally  unfair.  Again, \nDefendants  simply  decide  that  some  youngsters  will  receive \nthis  substantial  government  benefit  and  others  will  not. \n186.  Neither  Plaintiff Melinda  nor  Plaintiff  Leslie  F. \nwas  selected  to  participate  in  Defendants'  subsidized \nIndependent  Living  Program.  For  these  young  people,  as  well  as \nmany  other  putative  class members,  exclusion  from  this  program \ndeprives  them  of  the  opportunity  to  prepare  adequately  to  live \nindependently  once  they  are  discharged  from  foster  care.  The \ndenial  of  the  associated  Independent  Living  cash  benefit \nfurther  precludes  them  from  sustaining  themselves  financially \nand  exposes  them  to  brutal  and  overwhelming  need  for  the \nmonetary  support. \n86 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 87 of 116\n187.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  making \narbitrary  and  capricious  decisions  concerning  which  foster \nchildren  will  be  allowed  to  participate  in  the  subsidized \nIndependent  Living  Program  and  receive  the  cash  payment \nassociated with  it.  Defendants'  decision  to  exclude  Plaintiffs \nLeslie  F.  and Melinda  and  other  members  of  the  putative  class \nfrom  the  subsidized  Independent  Living  Program  has  arbitrarily \nand  capriciously  deprived  them  of  an  important  government \nbenefit,  causing  them  serious  and  irreparable  injury. \n188.  Defendants  have  consistently disregarded  their \nobligations  toward  the  innocent  abused  and  neglected  victims \nwho  languish,  almost  invisibly,  in  DCAF  foster  placements.  The \ninvisibility is  due,  at  least  in part,  to  Defendants' \nsubversion  and  misuse  of  the  confidentiality  that  protects \ncertain  records;  they misuse  the  confidentiality  to  shield \nthemselves  and  the  deficient  operation  of  Florida's  foster \ncare  system  - not  the  affected  children  or  families  - from \nscrutiny. \n189.  The  1995  Palm  Beach  County  Grand  Jury  Report \nre-recommended  areas  of  change  first  urged  in  the  December  14, \n1993  report  of  the  Fifteenth Circuit  Grand  Jury,  and  asked  for \na  statewide  Grand  Jury.  Defendant  Bush  and  his  predecessors  in \noffice  have  still not  petitioned  the  Florida  Supreme  Court  to \nimpanel  such  a  statewide  Grand  Jury.  Indeed,  the  only  known \nstatewide  quality  assurance  review  was  conducted  in  1994  and \n87 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 88 of 116\nfinalized  in  1995;  Defendants  have  intentionally provided  no \nquality control  assessment  since.  It  is  impossible  for \nDefendants  to  operate  the  Florida  foster  care  and  adoption \nprograms  appropriately  and  with  adequate  protection  for \nchildren  in  the  absence  of  meaningful  programmatic  compliance \nand  performance  evaluations. \n190.  Defendants'  deliberate  indifference  to  the  rights \nand  serious  needs  of  the  children  in  their  custody  and  their \npattern  and  practice  of  failing  to  exercise  competent \nprofessional  judgment  in  the  operation  of  the  Florida  foster \ncare  system  have  directly  and  proximately  caused  Plaintiffs \nand  the  putative  class members  to  be  deprived  of  safe \nplacements  that  meet  their basic  needs,  as  well  as  permanent, \nlegally  stable  families.  All  of  these  violations  of  the  rights \nof  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  have  resulted  in \nserious  physical,  mental  and  psychological  injuries  to  these \nalready  damaged  and  vulnerable  children  and  the  irretrievable \nloss  of  the  opportunity  to  develop  in  accordance  with  their \ninherent  abilities. \n2.  Violations  of  Plaintiffs' \nProcedural  Due  Process  Rights \n191.  When  state  law  creates  an  entitlement  to  a  benefit, \nDefendants  cannot  deny  the  benefit  to  an  individual  without \nproviding  that  person  with  notice  and  a  fair  and  adequate \nprocedure  for  challenging  the  denial  or,  in  some  limited \n88 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 89 of 116\ncircumstances,  without  requiring  a  professional  qualified by \nappropriate  training,  credentials  and  experience  to  determine, \nthrough  the  exercise  of  independent  professional  judgment, \nwhether  a  course  of  action  is  appropriate  for  the  individual. \n192.  The  State  of  Florida  has  created  entitlements  on \nbehalf  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  that \nDefendants  cannot  deny  to  such  children without  adequate \nprocedural  protections  or  in  an  arbitrary  and  capricious \nmanner.  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  any  procedures  for  a \nmeaningful  administrative  hearing  or  professional  review  of \nthe  deprivation  of  these  benefits.  Among  these  entitlements \nare: \na.  Caseworker  supervision  of  children  in  foster \ncare:  at  least monthly,  the  DCAF  out-of-home  counselor \nwill  visit  the  foster  child  and  foster  parents  in  the \nfoster  home,  Florida Administrative  Code,  §  65C-\n13.010(5) (g); \nb.  Caseworker  supervision  of  children  in  shelter \ncare:  while  a  child  in  Defendants'  custody  is  in  shelter \ncare,  the  DCAF  protective  investigator  or  service \ncounselor  will  make  at  least  two  contacts  with  the  child \nper  week,  at  least  one  of  which  must  be  face-to-face  with \nthe  child  and  shelter parent  or  provider;  and  during  the \nvisitation,  the  DCAF  worker  must  evaluate  the  condition \nof  the  shelter  home  or  facility,  whether  the  licensed \n89 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 90 of 116\ncapacity  of  the  shelter  has  been  exceeded,  the  treatment \nreceived  by  the  child  and  other  children  in  the  shelter, \nand  other  factors  that  affect  the  child,  Florida \nAdministrative  Code,  §  65C-12.008(3); \nc.  Medical  care:  when  there  are  indications  a  foster \nchild  has  sustained  a  physical  injury or  is  suffering \nfrom  an  illness,  a  licensed  health  care  professional \nshall  be  immediately  called or  the  child shall  be  taken \nto  the  nearest  available  hospital  for  emergency  care, \nFla.  Stat.  §  984.19(5). \nd.  Remaining  in  foster  care  after  reaching  majority: \nan  individual  may  remain  in  Defendants'  custody  following \nthe  person's  18th  birthday  (subject  to  limitations  on  the \nduration  of  the  in-care  period)  if:  the  individual  is \nenrolled  in  high  school,  a  program  leading  to  a  high \nschool  equivalency diploma,  or  a  full-time  career \neducation  program,  or  is  enrolled  full-time  or  accepted \nfor  admittance  in  a  postsecondary  vocational-technical \neducation  program,  a  community  college  program  leading \ntoward  a  vocational  or  an  associate  degree,  or  a \nuniversity or  college;  the  person  was  committed  to  the \nlegal  custody  of  DCAF  for  placement  in  foster  care  as  a \ndependent  child;  and  all other  resources  have  been \nthoroughly  explored  and  it can  be  clearly established \n90 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 91 of 116\nthat  there  are  no  alternative  resources  for  placement, \nFla.  Stat.  §  409.145(3};  and \ne.  Participation  in  the  subsidized  Independent \nLiving  Program:  a  cash  benefit  and  opportunity  to  live \nindependently  under  the  supervision  of  a  DCAF  caseworker \nor  other  responsible  adult  approved  by  DCAF;  Fla.  Stat.  § \n409.165(4} (b). \n193.  Defendants,  moreover,  have  not  established,  nor  have \nthey  provided  to  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members,  a \nprocedure  by  which  they  can  apply  to  Defendants  either  to \nremain  in  foster  care  beyond  their  18th  birthday  or  to \nparticipate  in  the  subsidized  Independent  Living  Program.  In \nthe  alternative,  if a  procedure  exists  either  to  apply  for  or \nto  challenge  the  denial  of  either  of  these  benefits, \nDefendants  do  not  give  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class \nmembers  notice  of  such  procedures  or  as  in  the  case  of Melinda \nand  some  putative  class  members,  coerce  and  mislead  the  child \ninto  signing  documents  relinquishing  these  benefits,  expressly \nignoring  and  precluding  input  from  the  children's  court \nappointed  attorneys  or  guardians  ad  litem. \n194.  Defendants'  failure  to  establish  a  process  for  an \nadministrative  hearing  or  professional  review  of  decisions  to \ndeny  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  the  benefits  to \nwhich  they  are  entitled,  or  to  have  an  application procedure \nor  give  notice  of  such  procedure  for  benefits  for  which \n91 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 92 of 116\neligibility criteria exist,  constitutes  a  pattern,  practice \nand  policy  of  depriving  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class \nmembers  due  process  of  law.  Plaintiffs  Jay  D.,  Candice  D., \nMatthew  I.,  Reggie  B.  Leanne  G.,  Leslie  F.  and  Melinda  and \nother  putative  class members  have  been  and  continue  to  be \nseriously  and  irreparably  injured  as  a  result  of  this  pattern \nand  practice. \n195.  Defendants'  failure  to  provide  Plaintiffs  and  the \nclass  members  with  the  process  that  is  due  when  they  deny  the \nabove-described  entitlements  to  such  children  constitutes \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  legal  rights  of  these  children. \n196.  The  Florida  Dependency  Court  conducts  periodic \nreviews  of  the  legal,  custodial  and  permanency  status  of  each \nchild  in  Defendants'  custody  as  an  abused  or  neglected  child. \nThese  review  hearings  continue  at  least  until  a  child who  is \nfree  for  adoption  has  been  placed  for  adoption.  The  child  is  a \nparty  to  the  proceeding  and  has  a  right  to  be  present  at  any \nhearing  unless  the  Dependency  Court  specifically  finds  the \nchild's mental  or  physical  condition  or  age  would  render  a \ncourt  appearance  contrary  to  the  child's  best  interest. \nSection  39.01(52),  Florida  Statutes;  Florida  Rules  of  Juvenile \nProcedure,  Rules  8.210,  8.255,  8.415.  The  Department  routinely \ngives  notice  to  the  parties,  other  than  children,  of  such \njudicial  reviews.  Some  periodic  reviews  for  some  children  over \n13  years  of  age  are  administrative,  rather  than  judicial.  They \n92 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 93 of 116\nalso  address  the  custodial  and  permanency  status  of  the  child. \nChildren  with  sufficient maturity  are  entitled  to  participate \nin  the  administrative  review.  Florida  Administrative  Code,  § \n65C-13.019.  Defendants  are  also  required  to  include  children, \nappropriaten,  in  DCAF's  development  of  a  case  plan  for \n~when \nthe  child.  Florida  Rules  of  Juvenile  Procedure,  Rule  8.400. \nThe  case  plan  is  the  basic  operating  document  for  each  child \nin  Defendants'  custody,  describing  the  on-going \nappropriateness  of  government  custody  and  the  child's  current \nplacement,  the  services  to  be  provided  by  DCAF  to  the  child \nand  the  child's  biological  and  foster  parents  need,  the \nchild's  permanency  goal,  and  other  critical planning \ninformation.  Planning  is  to  include  Independent  Living  and  the \nextension  of  foster  care  services  beyond  the  age  of  18. \n197.  To  a  significant  degree,  the  judicial  and \nadministrative  periodic  reviews  and  case  plans  determine  what \na  foster  child's  present  and  future  life will  be  like  and \nwhether  the  child will  achieve  permanency.  These  proceedings \nand  plans  are  of  the  utmost  importance  to  the  child's  long  and \nshort-term well  being,  and  the  child has  the  greatest  stake  of \nany  party  in  their  outcome.  No  other  party  or  participant  in \nthese  proceedings  or  in  developing  the  case  plan,  other  than \nthe  child's  attorney  or  guardian  ad  litem,  if one  is \nappointed,  has  an  interest  that  never  conflicts  with  that  of \nthe  child. \n93 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 94 of 116\n198.  As  the  child's  custodian,  Defendants  have  complete \ncontrol  over  whether  a  child will  be  able  to  attend  a  judicial \nreview  hearing,  administrative  review  conference  or  a  case \nplanning  conference.  A  child  can  attend  such  a  hearing  or \nconference  only  if informed  of  it.  Children  in  Defendants' \ncustody  are  dependent  on  DCAF  to  provide  transportation  to  a \njudicial hearing  or  an  administrative  case-planning \nconference. \n199.  Statistically,  less  than  50%  of  children  in  the \nfoster  care  system have  a  guardian  ad  litem.  At  this  time, \nthere  is  no  state  program  of  attorneys  for  these  children.  So \nfew  children  are  represented by  legal  counsel  that  this  is \nstatistically  irrelevant.  Unless  an  attorney  or  guardian  ad \nlitem has  been  appointed  for  a  child,  Defendants  have  a \npattern  and  practice  of  failing  to  notify  children  of  judicial \nreview  hearings  and  administrative  review  and  case  planning \nconferences  and  of  failing  to  provide  transportation  and  other \nservices  the  children  need  to  be  able  to  attend  and \nparticipate  in  such  hearings  and  conferences. \n200.  Defendants  also  do  not  have  standards  for \ndetermining  when  a  child would  be  an  appropriate  participant \nin  a  case  planning  conference  or  has  sufficient maturity  to \nparticipate  in  an  administrative  review  conference.  In  fact, \nDefendants  rarely,  if ever,  provide  children  in  their  custody \nwith  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  such  conferences,  and \n94 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 95 of 116\nDefendants'  decision-making  on  this  matter,  or  lack  of  it,  is \narbitrary and  capricious.  As  in Melinda's  case,  even  when  an \nattorney or  guardian  is  appointed,  Defendants  have  a  pattern \nand  practice  of  ignoring  said appointees  and  denying  them \ninput,  further  interfering with  and  denying  foster  children \ntheir  due  process  rights. \n201.  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of  denying  foster \nchildren  an  opportunity  to  attend  and  participate  in  judicial \nreview  hearings  and  administrative  review  and  case  planning \nconferences  deprives  them  of  due  process  of  law  and \nconstitutes  deliberate  indifference  to  the  children's  legal \nrights.  Plaintiffs  Leslie  F.  and  Melinda  and  other  members  of \nthe  putative  class  have  been  and  continue  to  be  seriously  and \nirreparably harmed  as  a  result  of  this  pattern  and  practice. \n3.  Violations  of  Plaintiffs'  First, \nNinth  And  Fourteenth Amendment  Rights \n202.  Children  have  substantial  associational  and  familial \ninterests  in  continuing  to  reside  with  their  siblings  when \nthey  are  taken  into,  and  while  they  remain  in,  government \ncustody,  absent  a  compelling  reason  for  their  separation. \nAdditionally,  except  when  the  separation  of  siblings  is \nnecessary  to  protect  the  health,  safety or  welfare  of  one  of \nthe  children,  it contravenes  competent  professional  judgment \nto  separate  siblings  who  are  in  government  custody.  Only  a \nprofessional  qualified  by  training,  credentials  and \n95 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 96 of 116\nexperience,  who  exercises  independent  professional  judgment, \nis  capable  of  making  the  required  determination  that  placing \nsiblings  together  would  be  contrary  to  the  health,  safety or \nwelfare  of  one  of  the  children.  The  separation  of  siblings \nwithout  such  a  professional's  determination,  and  periodic \nreappraisal,  deprives  the  children  of  rights  secured  to  them \nby  the  First,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United \nStates  Constitution. \n203.  In  the  event  a  professional  determines  placing \nsiblings  together  in  an  out-of-home  placement  would  be \ncontrary  to  the  health,  safety  or  welfare  of  one  of  the \nchildren,  such  children  have  an  associational  and  familial \ninterest  in  frequent  and  regular  visitation with  each  other. \nIt would,  moreover,  be  contrary  to  competent  professional \njudgment  to  fail  to  provide  such  regular  and  frequent  sibling \nvisitation,  absent  a  finding  by  a  professional,  qualified by \ntraining,  credentials  and  experience  and  exercising \nindependent  professional  judgment,  that  such  visitation would \nbe  contrary  to  the  health,  safety or  welfare  of  one  of  the \nchildren.  The  denial  of  regular  and  frequent  sibling \nvisitation  in  the  absence  of  such  a  professional's \ndetermination,  and  periodic  reappraisal  of  the  decision, \ndeprives  the  children of  rights  secured  to  them  by  the  First, \nNinth  and  Fourteenth Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n96 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 97 of 116\n204.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  separating \nsiblings  who  are  in  their  custody  and  depriving  them  of \nregular  and  frequent  visitation with  each  other,  although \nplacement  together  or  visitation would  not  be  contrary  to  the \nhealth,  safety or  welfare  of  any  of  the  children  and  despite \nthe  absence  of  a  qualified professional's  independent \ndetermination  that  the  joint placement  or  visitation would  be \ndetrimental  to  any  of  the  children.  Plaintiffs  Tanya  M., \nTammy  G.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Leanne  G.,  John  J.,  Melinda \nand  Karina,  Elaine  R.,  Leslie  F.,  and  other  putative  class \nmembers  have  been  unnecessarily  separated  from  their  siblings \nwho  are  also  in  Defendants'  custody,  have  been  deprived  of \nregular  and  frequent  visitation with  their  siblings,  and  have \nsuffered  a  serious  injury  as  a  result.  Defendants  know  of  this \npractice  and  are  deliberately  indifferent  to  its effect  on \nthese  children. \n4.  Violation  of  Plaintiffs'  Rights  Under \nthe  Adoption  and  Safe  Families  Act \n205.  The  Adoption  and  Safe  Families Act  ( \"ASFA\"),  which \namended  Title  IV-E  of  the  Social  Security Act,  enacted  as  the \nAdoption  Assistance  and  Child Welfare  Act  of  1980,  42  U.S.C. \n§§  670  et  seq.,  imposed  new  obligations  on  Defendants,  which \nthey  owe  to  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  putative  class \nas  children  in  government-supported  foster  care. \n97 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 98 of 116\n206.  Under  ASFA,  Defendants  are  required  to  initiate  a \nproceeding  to  terminate  the  parental  rights  to  any  child who \nhas  been  in  their  custody  for  15  of  the  most  recent  22  months \nunless,  at  the  option  of  the  State,  the  child  is  in  the  care \nof  a  relative  or  unless  (a)  Defendants  have  documented  in  the \ncase  plan  a  compelling  reason  for  determining  that  filing  such \na  petition would  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  child or \n(b)  Defendants  have  not  provided  to  the  child's  family  such \nservices  as  Defendants  deem  necessary  for  the  safe  return  of \nthe  child  to  the  child's  home,  if such  provision  is  required \nunder  the  Act.  42  U.S.  C.  §  675(5) (E). \n207.  Defendants  routinely  fail  to  initiate  termination  of \nparental  rights  proceedings  on  behalf  of  children  in  foster \ncare  for  15  of  the  most  recent  22  months,  although  none  of  the \nexceptions  are  applicable.  Defendants  also  routinely, \nknowingly  and  intentionally  fail  to  provide  or  choose  not  to \nprovide  the  services  they  have  determined  to  be  necessary  for \nthe  safe  return  of  children  in  their  care,  thereby  depriving \nthose  children of  the  right  to  permanency  conferred by  ASFA. \nThese  acts  are  part  of  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  needs  and  rights  of  the \nchildren  in  their  custody.  Plaintiffs  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie \nS.,  Sandra  M.,  Hugh  S.,  Reggie  B.  and  Rebecca  B.,  Melinda  and \nKarina,  Bonnie  L.,  and  members  of  the  putative  class  have  been \ninjured by  these  practices  of  Defendants. \n98 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 99 of 116\n208.  ASFA  also  requires  Defendants  to  have,  review, \nupdate  and  provide  to  each  foster  parent  or  foster  care \nprovider  a  health  and  education  record  for  each  child placed \nin  such  home  or  facility.  42  U.S.C.  §  675(5) (D).  Defendants \nroutinely  fail  to  obtain  the  required  education  and  health \ninformation,  review  and  update  it,  or  provide  a  record \ncontaining  the  specified  information  to  each  foster  home  or \nfacility  in which  a  child  in Defendants'  custody  is  placed.  On \ninformation  and  belief,  Defendants  failed  to  fulfill  these \nobligations  with  respect  to  Plaintiffs Matthew  I.,  Reggie  B., \nLeanne  G.,  Melinda,  Karina,  other  Plaintiffs,  and  other \nmembers  of  the  putative  class,  and  as  a  result,  such  children \nhave  been  injured  and  have  not  received  needed  attention  to \ntheir  health  and  educational  needs. \n5.  Violations  of  Plaintiffs'  Rights  Under  the \nEarly  and  Periodic  Screening,  Diagnosis  and \nTreatment  (EPSDT)  Provisions  of  the  Medicaid  Title \n209.  Under  the  EPSDT  provisions  of  the Medicaid  Title  of \nthe  federal  Social  Security Act,  Defendants  are  required  to \nensure  that  all  Florida Medicaid-eligible  children  up  to  the \nage  of  twenty-one  years,  including  Plaintiffs  and  the  members \nof  the  putative  class,  receive  comprehensive  physical, \ndevelopmental  and  mental  health  care.  Among  the  services \nDefendants  are  required  to  ensure  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative \nclass  members  receive  are: \n99 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 100 of 116\na.  Periodic  comprehensive  health  screens,  at  the \nage-appropriate  intervals  deemed  proper  by  a  board  of \nmedical  professionals,  including  general  physical \nexaminations,  eye  examinations,  dental  examinations, \nhearing  examinations,  lead  blood  tests,  and  vaccinations \nor  boosters,  all  performed  by  competent  medical \nprofessionals;  and \nb.  Any  and  all  follow-up  physical  health  services  or \ntreatment  deemed  necessary  to  treat  or  address  any \ncondition  diagnosed  at  any  periodic  screening,  performed \nin  a  timely manner,  regardless  of  whether  any  such \ntreatment  or  service  is  otherwise  covered  by  the  Florida \nMedicaid  plan. \n210.  Defendants  routinely  fail  to  ensure  that  Plaintiffs \nand  the  putative  class members  are  given  general  physical \nexaminations,  eye  examinations,  dental  examinations,  hearing \nexaminations,  lead  blood  tests,  and  vaccinations  or  boosters, \nat  the  specified  times  and  that  these  children  receive  timely \nand  needed  follow-up  physical  health  services  and  treatment. \nDefendants  are  fully  aware  of  their EPSDT  obligations  and  the \npattern  and  practice  of  failing  to  meet  these  requirements.  As \na  result  of  Defendants'  failure  to  fulfill  their  EPSDT \nobligations,  Plaintiffs Matthew  I.,  Reggie  B.  and  Leanne  G. \nand  other  members  of  the  putative  class  have  been  injured. \n100 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 101 of 116\n6.  Violations  of  the  Rights  of  Plaintiffs \nPaul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S., \nTammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and  Karina  and  the  Putative \nSubclass  Under  Title VI  of  the  1964  Civil  Rights  Act \n211.  The  State  of  Florida,  DCAF  and  Defendants  are \nrecipients  of  federal  financial  assistance  through  the  United \nStates  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  [\"DHHS\"]  for \nthe  Florida  foster  care  and  adoption  program  and  the  child \nwelfare  services  program. \n212.  Title VI  of  the  1964  Civil  Rights  Act  prohibits  any \nstate program  or  activity  that  receives  federal  financial \nassistance  from  excluding  from  participation,  denying  benefits \nto  or  subjecting  to  discrimination,  any  person  on  the  basis  of \nrace,  color  or  national  origin.  42  U.S.C.  §§  2000d  et ~.; 45 \nC.F.R.  §  80.3. \n213.  DHHS  has  promulgated  regulations,  pursuant  to  Title \nVI,  that  prohibit  any  state  programs  or  activities  that \nreceive  federal  financial  assistance  that  are  subject  to  the \nregulations  from  utilizing  criteria or  methods  of \nadministration  which  have  the  effect  of  subjecting  individuals \nto  discrimination because  of  their  race,  color,  or  national \norigin,  or  have  the  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \nimpairing  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  the  program  with \nrespect  to  individuals  of  a  particular  race,  color,  or \nnational  origin.  42  U.S.C.  §  2000d-1;  45  C.F.R.  §  80.3.  These \n101 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 102 of 116\nregulations  apply  to  the  operation  of  the  Florida  foster  care \nand  adoption  program  under  Defendants'  direction  and  control. \n214.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  treating \nBlack  foster  children  differently  and  less  advantageously  than \nWhite  foster  children,  because  of  their  race  or  color,  with \nrespect  to  access  to,  receipt  of  and  the  quality  and  value  of \nservices  and  benefits.  Such  difference  in  treatment \nconstitutes  illegal  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race  or \ncolor  under  Title  VI  and  affects,  among  other  aspects  of \nDefendants'  foster  care  and  adoption  programs,  the  number  of \ntimes  foster  children  are  moved  from  one  placement  to  another, \nthe  timing  and  tenacity with  which  Defendants  pursue  permanent \nfamilies  for  foster  children,  and  the  identification of  and \nplacement  of  the  child with  an  appropriate  permanent  family. \nPlaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Tammy \nG.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and  Karina  and  the  members  of  the \nputative  subclass  have  suffered  and  continue  to  suffer  serious \nand  irreparable  harm  as  a  result  of  Defendants'  actions  that \nare  discriminatory  on  the  basis  of  race  or  color. \n215.  Defendants  have  a  pattern  and  practice  of  utilizing \nracially neutral  criteria or  methods  of  administration  that \nhave  the  effect  of  subjecting  Black  foster  children  to \ndiscrimination  because  of  their  race  or  color  or  have  the \neffect of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing  accomplishment \nof  the  objectives  of  the  foster  care  and  adoption  program  for \n102 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 103 of 116\nBlack  foster  children because  of  their  race  or  color. \nDefendants'  inadequate  operation  of  the  Florida  foster  care \nand  adoption  system  injures  all  children  in  Defendants' \ncustody,  but  has  an  even  more  deleterious  effect  on  Black \nfoster  children  than  on  White  foster  children.  When  such \nracially neutral  criteria or  methods  of  administration  have  an \nillegal  disparate  impact  by  race  or  color,  they  constitute \ndiscrimination  on  the  basis  of  race  or  color  proscribed  by \nTitle VI. \n216.  Among  the  racially neutral  criteria and  methods  of \nadministration  Defendants  employ  that  discriminate  against \nBlack  foster  children  on  the  basis  of  their  race  or  color  are \nthe  efforts  Defendants  make  to  recruit  foster  and  adoptive \nfamilies,  the  efforts  Defendants  make  to  move  foster  children \nexpeditiously  to  permanency,  the  types,  quantity  and  quality \nof  services  and  benefits  provided  to  the  biological  parents  or \nrelatives  of  children  in  Defendants'  custody  for  the  purpose \nof  moving  the  children  to  permanency,  the  process  of  selecting \na  foster  family  or  facility  that  is  appropriate  for  an \nindividual  child,  and  the  recruitment  and  training  of  DCAF \nstaff who  work  with  foster  children. \n217.  These  racially neutral  criteria  and  methods  of \nadministration  have  the  effect  of  subjecting Black  foster \nchildren  to  discrimination  because  of  their  race  or  color  and \nhave  the  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially  impairing \n103 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 104 of 116\naccomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  the  foster  care  and \nadoption  program  for  them.  Plaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F., \nLaurie  S.  and  Lillie  S.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and \nKarina  and  the  members  of  the  putative  subclass  have  suffered \nand  continue  to  suffer  serious  and  irreparable  harm  as  a \nresult  of  Defendants'  practices  that  have  a  disparate  impact \non  and  disadvantage  Black  foster  children. \nG.  PLAINTIFFS  HAVE  NO  ADEQUATE  REMEDY  AT  LAW \n218.  Paragraphs  1  through  137  and  139  through  217  are \nincorporated  herein  by  reference. \n219.  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  have  and \ncontinue  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  by  Defendants'  above \ndescribed  acts  and  omissions  and  do  not  have  an  adequate \nremedy  at  law,  thereby making  appropriate  declaratory  and \ninjunctive  relief. \nH.  CAUSES  OF  ACTION \n220.  Paragraphs  1  through  137  and  139  through  217  are \nincorporated  into  each  Cause  of  Action  (First  through  Sixth) \nset  forth  below. \n1.  First  Cause  of Action  - Substantive  Due  Process \n221.  The  foregoing  actions  and  inactions  of  Defendants \nare  inconsistent  with  the  exercise  of  competent  professional \njudgment;  deprive  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  of \nbasic  needs  while  in  government  custody;  create  conditions  of \ncare,  treatment  and  duration  of  custody  that  are  inconsistent \n104 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 105 of 116\nwith  the  purpose  for  which  Defendants  took  Plaintiffs  and  the \nputative  class  members  into  custody;  comprise  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  decision-making;  and  amount  to  a  pattern,  practice \nand  custom  of  deliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  and \nconstitutionally protected  rights  and  needs  of  Plaintiffs  and \nthe  putative  class  members.  As  a  result,  Plaintiffs  and  the \nmembers  of  the  putative  class  have  been  deprived  of  the \nsubstantive  due  process  rights  conferred  on  them  by  the \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  These \nrights  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  the  right  to  have \ntheir basic  need  for  food,  clothing,  safe  care,  shelter, \nmedical  care  and  education met;  the  right  to  protection  from \nunnecessary  harm,  injury or  deterioration;  the  right  not  to  be \nharmed  while  in  state  custody;  the  right  not  to  be \nunnecessarily  deprived  of  their  liberty by  retention  in  state \ncustody;  the  right  not  to  have  their  liberty unnecessarily \nrestrained by  the  use  of  chemical  agents  for  non-therapeutic \npurposes;  the  right  to  treatment  and  care  that,  in  terms  of \nits  nature,  conditions  and  duration  are  consistent  with  the \npurposes  for  which  they  were  taken  into  government  custody, \nincluding  safety,  protection  from  abuse,  neglect  and \nabandonment;  the  right  not  to be  retained  in  state  custody \nlonger  than  necessary  to  accomplish  the  purposes  to  be  served \nby  state  custody;  the  right  to  receive  care,  treatment  and \nservices  consistent  with  the  exercise  of  competent \n105 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 106 of 116\nprofessional  judgment;  the  right  to  be  protected  from  state \ncreated  dangers,  including  placement  in  dangerous,  abusive, \novercrowded  or  neglectful  out-of-horne  placements  or  returned \nto  a  dangerous  condition  in  the  horne  of  the  child's  biological \nfamily;  and  the  right  to  eligibility determinations  that  are \nnot  arbitrary or  capricious. \n2.  Second  Cause  of  Action  - Procedural  Due  Process \n222.  The  foregoing  actions  and  inactions  of  Defendants \ndeprive  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members  of  state \ncreated  entitlements  without  providing  an  adequate  and  fair \nprocedure,  including:  a  professional  review  of  any  failure  to \nprovide  required  caseworker-child  contact  and  visits  or  to \nobtain  immediate  medical  consultation when  a  foster  child \nexhibits  an  indication of  injury  or  illness;  an  opportunity  to \nsubmit  an  application  to  remain  in  foster  care  after  reaching \n18  years  of  age  or  to  participate  in  the  subsidized \nIndependent  Living  Program;  an  opportunity  for  an \nadministrative  hearing  to  challenge  an  adverse  decision  on  any \nsuch  application;  and  notice  of  any  process  by  which  such  an \nadverse  decision  on  an  application  can  be  reviewed. \nDefendants  further  deprive  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class \nmembers  of  their  right  to  be  present  and  provide  meaningful \ninput  at  judicial  review  hearings  and  administrative  review \nand  case  planning  conferences.  Such  lack  of  fair  and  adequate \nprocess  with  respect  to  the  above-listed benefits,  hearings \n106 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 107 of 116\nand  conferences  deprives  such  children  of  due  process  of  law \nin  violation  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution  and  amounts  to  a  pattern,  practice  and  policy of \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  and  constitutionally \nprotected  needs  and  rights  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative \nclass  members. \n3.  Third  Cause  of  Action  - First, \nNinth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments \n223.  The  foregoing  actions  and  inactions  of  Defendants \nthat  unnecessarily  separate  siblings  in  Defendants'  custody \nand  unnecessarily  deprive  such  separated  siblings  of  frequent \nand  regular  visitation  are  inconsistent  with  the  exercise  of \ncompetent  professional  judgment  in  violation  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution;  deprive  such \nchildren  of  associational  and  familial  rights  in  violation of \nthe  First,  Ninth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United \nStates  Constitution;  deprive  such  children  of  constitutionally \n' \nprotected  liberty  interests  without  adequate  or  due  process  in \nviolation  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution;  and  amount  to  a  pattern,  practice  and  custom  of \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  and  constitutionally \nprotected needs  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative  class  members. \n4.  Fourth  Cause  of Action  -\nAdoption  and  Safe  Families  Act \n224.  As  a  result  of  the  foregoing  actions  and  inactions \nof  Defendants,  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  putative \n107 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 108 of 116\nclass  are  being  deprived  of  rights  conferred  on  them  by  the \nfederal  Adoption  and  Safe  Families  Act.  These  rights  include, \nbut  are  not  limited  to:  the  right  to  have  Defendants  initiate \na  proceeding  to  terminate  parental  rights  when  the  child has \nbeen  in  Defendants'  custody  for  15  of  the  most  recent  22 \nmonths,  unless  the  child  resides  with  a  relative  or  Defendants \nhave  documented  a  compelling  reason  not  to  terminate  parental \nrights;  the  right  to  have  Defendants  offer  the  child's \nbiological  family  the  services  Defendants  deem  necessary  for \nthe  safe  return  of  the  child  to  the  child's  home  in  order  to \ntrigger  the  child's  right  to  have  Defendants  initiate  a \ntermination  of  parental  rights  proceeding;  and  the  right  to \nhave  Defendants  obtain  required  education  and  health \ninformation,  review  it,  update  it,  and  provide  the  education \nand  health  record  to  each  foster  home  or  facility  in  which  a \nchild  is  placed.  Defendants'  failure  to  fulfill  their \nobligations  under  ASFA  amounts  to  a  pattern,  practice  and  ' \ncustom  of  deliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  needs  and \nfederally  protected  rights  of  Plaintiffs  and  the  putative \nclass  members. \n5.  Fifth Cause  of Action  -\nEarly  and  Periodic  Screening,  Diagnosis  and  Treatment \n225.  As  a  result  of  the  foregoing  actions  and  inactions \nof  Defendants,  Plaintiffs  and  the  members  of  the  putative \nclass  are  being  denied  the  rights  conferred  on  them  by  the \n108 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 109 of 116\nEarly  and  Periodic  Screening,  Diagnosis  and  Treatment  (EPSDT) \nprovision  of  the  Medicaid  Title  of  the  federal  Social  Security \nAct.  These  rights  include  but  are  not  limited  to  these \nchildren's  right  to  receive  periodic  general  physical  health \nexaminations  administered  by  competent  medical  professionals \nat  appropriate  intervals  determined  by  a  panel  of  independent \nhealth  care  experts;  their  right  to  receive  periodic  hearing \nand  eye  examinations,  dental  examinations  and  lead blood \ntests,  administered by  competent  medical  professionals  at  age \nappropriate  intervals;  their  right  to  receive  all  necessary \nchildhood  vaccinations  and  boosters  at  appropriate  times;  and \ntheir  right  to  receive  any  and  all  treatments  deemed  necessary \nby  a  qualified medical  professional  conducting  any  of  the \nabove-mentioned  periodic  health  examinations.  Defendants' \nfailure  to  fulfill  their  EPSDT  obligations  amounts  to  a \npattern,  practice  and  custom  of  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nserious  needs  and  federally  protected  rights  of  Plaintiffs  and \nthe  putative  class  members. \n6.  Sixth  Cause  of Action  - Title  VI \n226.  As  a  result  of  the  foregoing  actions  and  inactions \nof  the  defendants,  Plaintiffs  Paul  B.,  Leslie  F.,  Laurie  s. \nand  Lillie  S.,  Tammy  G.,  Leanne  G.,  Melinda  and  Karina,  and \nthe  members  of  the  putative  subclass  are  being  denied  the \nrights  conferred  on  them  by  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act \nof  1964  and  regulations  promulgated  by  the  United  States \n• \n109 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 42   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/30/2000   Page 110 of 116\nDepartment  of  Health  and  Human  Services  pursuant  to  Title VI. \nThese  rights  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  right  not  to \nbe  excluded  from  the  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits \nof,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or \nactivity  receiving  federal  financial  assistance;  and  the  right \nnot  to  have  any  state program  or  activity which  receives \nfederal  financial  assistance  utilize  criteria or  methods  of \nadministration  which  have  the  effect  of  subjecting  any  person \nto  discrimination  on  the  ground  of  their  race,  color,  or \nnational  origin,  or  which  have  the  effect  of  defeating  or \nsubstantially  impairing  the  accomplishment  of  the  objectives \nof  the  programs  with  respect  to  individuals  of  a  particular \nrace,  color,  or  national  origin.  Defendants'  failure  to \nfulfill  their  Title  IV  obligations  amounts  to  a  pattern, \npractice  and  custom  of  deliberate  indifference  to  the  serious \nneeds  and  federally  protected  rights  of  Plaintiffs  and  the \nputative  class  members. \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE  Plaintiffs,  on  behalf  of  themselves  and  the \nmembers  of  the  class  and  subclass  they  seek  to  represent, \nrequest  that  this  Court: \nA. Assume  and  retain  jurisdiction over  this  matter; \nB.  Determine  that  this  matter  may  proceed  as  a  class \naction  pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.

E. \n#93) and the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant Governor Jeb Bush (D.E. #94) pursuant to an \nOrder of Reference entered by the Honorable Federico A. Moreno, United States District Judge. \nThis Court has reviewed the motions, the file in this cause and has heard argument of counsel. \nI.  DISCUSSION \nA.  The Allegations of the Amended Complaint \nThe complex  116 page,  226 paragraph Amended Complaint filed  in  this cause seeks \ndeclaratory and injunction relief pursuant to 42 U .S.C. § 1983 based on various alleged violations of \nthe rights of the Plaintiffs who are children in the Defendants' custody.  According to the Amended \nComplaint,  the  suit  challenges  the  Defendants'  \"pattern  and  practice··  of not  meeting  the \nconstitutional and statutory obligations owed to the children and the \"deliberate indifference\" by the \nDefendants to the existence of this pattern and practice. (~3). \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 2 of 36\nThe Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for Substantive Due Process (Count I): \nProcedural Due Process (Count 2); Violations of the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments \n(Count 3); Violation ofthe Adoption and Safe Families Act (Count 4); Violation of the Early and \nPeriodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment provisions of42 U.S.C. § 1396 (Count 5) and Violation \nof Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Count 6).  The Amended Complaint seeks a declaration \nthat the acts of the Defendants are unconstitutional and unlawful; the imposition of a permanent \ninjunction: the appointment of an expert panel to develop and oversee a plan for reform: the \nappointment of a permanent ombudsman and the award of fees and costs. \n(l) The Plaintiffs \nThe Amended Complaint sets out extensive allegations concerning each of the Plaintiffs. as \nis set forth below. \nPlaintiff Bonnie L. has been in the foster care system since 1986, and has been subject to \nabuse. including beatings and other torture by her adoptive parents. The Department of Children and \nFamilies received several calls reporting the abuse in 1990. 1993, 1994 and 1997. Bonnie \\Vas then \ntaken back into foster care, with no further attempts to  seek a permanent family.  (~5-6).  The \nDepartment recently agreed to Bonnie's adoption by her biological mother. but this was not final at \nthe time of the filing of the Amended Complaint. (~8).  According to the Amended Complaint. \nBonnie has suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm. (~9). \nPlaintiffs Rebecca and Reggie B. are described in the Amended Complaint as 13 year old \ntw·ins residing in District 9.  These children were placed in a shelter in 1997. and \\Vere adjudicated \ndependent on June 1, 1998.  Reggie was sent to a group home. but suffered drastic deterioration and \nwas then returned to \"his previous overcrowded foster home'\" where further deterioration occurred. \n2 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 3 of 36\nReggie was asked to leave the home, and spent weeks moving from one shelter and foster home to \nanother. He is presently in a therapeutic group home. (~1 0-11 ).  The Amended Complaint adds that \na relative was available to be a placement resource for the children, but that no prior request was \nmade for her to care for the children.  The Plaintiffs allege that if this resource \\Vere utilized earlier \nby the Defendants, Reggie would not have suffered the several emotional problems he presently \nfaces.  Reggie also suffers from a cleft palate and other medical needs, which the Plaintiffs allege \nthe \"Defendants have failed to address.''  According to the Amended Complaint. Reggie missed \nseveral medical appointments, \"which have caused him to ··fall through the cracks'\" at the clinic.'\" \n(~12-14). \nPlaintiffs Laurie and Lillian S, two sisters  born in 1991 and 1993. entered the Defendant\" s \ncustody in 1994, and are presently in foster care.(~ 17). The girls also have several siblings in foster \ncare in different homes, and they are not provided with visitation.  According to the Amended \nComplaint, the siblings were separated \"because Defendants failed to recruit a sufficient number of \nfoster homes for large siblings groups, and failed to arrange for visits between the separately placed \nchildren.\" (~18). The Plaintiffs also allege that this method of administration. \\Vhile racially neutral. \nhas a disparate impact on Black siblings in foster care such as Laurie and Lillian. and makes sibling \nseparation more likely for Black foster children. (~ 18). \nThe Amended Complaint also alleges that the Defendants placed the girls in an inappropriate \nfoster home which has been the subject of numerous investigations. According to the PlaintitTs. the \nDepartment ignored the complaints about placement and kept the girls there for years.  However. \nafter the Department adoption worker requested that the foster mother work on issues involving her \nhome and parenting, the foster mother requested the immediate removal of the children. (',i 21 ).  The \n3 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 4 of 36\nchildren were then suddenly and traumatically  moved from the home and the girls mental and \nemotional health began to deteriorate.  Ultimately,  Lillie, at age 7, was involuntarily committed to \na mental health crisis unit. (~ 22). \nThe Amended Complaint asserts that the Department has located an uncle who wishes to \nadopt the girls, and in fact, he had informed the Department of this fact in 1994, but was told that \nrelatives could not adopt.  According to the Plaintiffs, the failure by the Department to achieve a \npermanent family more quickly was a result of the practice of treating Black and White foster \nchildren  differently  and  in  their  making  less efforts  to  provide  services  and  develop  proper \nplacements for Black children than for White children.(~ 23. 24). \nPlaintiff Leslie F. is a 17 year old foster child \\vho is Black and of Haitian descent. Leslie \nhas been freed for adoption since she was 9 years old, but has never been adopted or provided w·ith \na permanent home.  Her former foster mother adopted Leslie's biological brother. but refused to \nadopt Leslie and then cut off all contact between Leslie and her brother.  Leslie has had over 30. and \npossibly as many as 50, different foster care placements and according to the Amended Complaint. \nwas told by her caseworker that a stable placement could not be found because no one \\vanted her. \n(~ 27. 28).  According to the Plaintiffs, the large number of placements and the failure to tind a \npermanent home for Leslie was a result of the practices of the Defendants in treating children \ndifferently based on their race. (~29, 30). \nThe Department found a foster home for Leslie in 1999. but a visit by a supervisor revealed \ninsufficient food and other problems.  The concerns \\vere raised with a Department licensing \nsupervisor (the person responsible for determining whether foster homes \\viii  be  licensed and \nwhether they retain their licenses), and the licensing supervisor was asked to speak with the children \n4 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 5 of 36\nin the home to verify the conditions.  This supervisor refused to do so and also refused to call the \nchild abuse hotline to report the concerns about children not being fed. The supervisor indicated that \nshe talks to the foster parents, not the children and that she is an advocate for the foster parents and \ndoes not call the hotline to report them. (~ 32). \nThe Amended Complaint also alleges that the Defendants make arbitrary and capricious \ndecisions as to who will remain in care after reaching 18 years of age; that the Defendants have \nprevented Leslie from participating in proceedings relating to her case plan, and that she is at risk \nof being denied participation in an Independent Living Program. (~ 36-38). \nPlaintiffSandra M. is a 16 year old who was placed in foster care in 1989.  Sandra and her \nbrother were placed in a foster home together for two years, and after their natural parent's rights \nw·ere terminated, the foster parents requested to adopt the children.  However, according to the \nAmended Complaint, this request was denied by the Defendants \"for no legitimate reason.\" (,]39). \nThe siblings were then separated, with both being held in foster care.  After being placed in several \ndifferent homes, Sandra was eventually placed with a stable foster parent. \nThe Defendants then moved Sandra from  this home to an adoptive home with her brother \nand an older sister.  This placement lasted only 6 months due to disturbed behavior by the siblings, \nand Sandra was then returned to the foster home.  The foster parent decided to adopt Sandra. then \nage 8, but problems developed, and Sandra was ultimately returned to the custody ofthe Defendants. \nAfter being placed in a shelter where she was attacked and beaten, Sandra was returned for a time \nwith the adoptive mother, and then placed back in foster care. (~ 41, 42). \nSandra was placed in several foster homes and then in a group home. which subsequently \nclosed.  The Defendants then placed Sandra at a crisis unit at a Mental Health Center. where she \n5 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 6 of 36\nremained for one year.  Ultimately. she was placed in a residential psychiatric setting. and then in \na therapeutic group home.  According to the Plaintiffs. the Defendants have never moved to \nterminate the parental rights of the adoptive parent and the Defendants have the intention for Sandra \nto remain in foster care until she reaches majority, thus. efTectively abandoning any attempt to tind \nher a permanent home. (~43, 44). \nTanya M. is a 14 year old first placed in foster care in August. 1998.  She was placed in \nseveral foster homes where she was subject to neglect and dangerous treatment including inadequate \nfeeding which resulted in a harmful weight loss.  In another home she was one of 8 children \\vho \nslept in one bedroom and shared one dresser. (~ 46).  The Amended Complaint also sets out \nallegations concerning Tanya's placement at another overcrowded home. in which the foster mother \nhad advised the Department that Tanya was not acceptable for placement.  Despite this warning, \nTanya was left at the home after the Department's office had closed. and ultimately, Tanya left and \nwas found by a police officer walking alone at night carrying her possessions in bags and a backpack. \n(~ 47). \nTanya was sent to another home and was doing well. She was then returned to her biological \nparents, but the reunification failed, and less than two months after returning, she was assaulted by \nher father and suffered a broken arm. Tanya was then placed in an overcrowded group shelter. \\Vith \nplans by the Department to place Tanya at a wilderness camp used primarily as a moderate risk \ndelinquency commitment program. even though she is not delinquent and has not committed any \nviolations of law.  According to the Amended Complaint, Tanya has run away from the shelter and \nher whereabouts are not known. (~ 48, 49, 51).  The Plaintiffs also allege that she has never been \nplaced with her three younger siblings who were also removed from the biological parent's home. \n6 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 7 of 36\nand that no proper decision has been made that a joint placement would be detrimental to any of the \nchildren. (~ 50). \nJay and Candice D. are brother and sister who were born in 1992 and 1991, respectively. \nThey have been in foster care since February. 1996, with parental rights to these children terminated \nin June, 1998.  The children have resided in a stable environment since ApriL 1997. and both have \nbonded to their group home parents.  Both children had behavioral problems during the time that \ntheir older brother was placed at the group home, but were doing well since his removal.  According \nto the Amended Complaint, the children's therapist as well as the staff at the group home indicated \ntheir belief that the children's behavior stabilized because the removal of the older brother gave them \nan increased sense of security.(~ 53-56). \nThe children had only three visits from a Department caseworker between April. 1997 and \nFebruary. 2000.  However, on March 20, 2000, the Defendants announced that they intended to \nremove the children from the group home, place them in an interim placement and then put them in \nanother foster home with the older brother.  According to the Plaintiffs. this plan is presently on \nhold. but the Department has excluded the personnel of the group home from  any planning or \nmeetings concerning the children. (~ 57, 58). 1 \nPlaintiff Matthew I., is two years old, and according to the Amended Complaint was \n·'neglected in a grossly overcrowded foster home.\"(~ 61 ).  In October, 1999. Matthev.' was observed \nby a worker from an agency that contracts with the Defendants to be very sick. having difticulty \nbreathing and with a bite mark on his arm.  The next month. another worker from the agency found \n1 On March 30, 200 I, the Defendants filed a Notice of Filing Final Judgment of Adoption for Jay D. and \nCandice D., which indicated that the children had been adopted and were no longer in the physical or legal custody of \nthe Department. (D.E. #205). \n7 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 8 of 36\nMatthew to be very dirty, with a bruise on his chin, a dirty diaper and long. dirty.  finger nails and \ntoe nails.  He was also sick and wheezing. The worker took Matthew to a hospital emergency room \nwhere he was found to have a 104 degree fever and was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.  The \nfoster home was noted as emitting a strong odor, with old food on the floor. and a sink overflowing \nwith dirty dishes.(~ 61-63). \nApproximately 2 weeks later, a Department worker found Matthew to be very sick. dirty and \nwith a black eye.  The foster mother reported that Matthew and another child had fallen off a couch \nwhile fighting.  The worker did not report the condition of either the home or Matthev,: to the \nhotline. (~ 64 ). \nMatthew was removed from the home in January. 2000.  The new foster mother found him \nto be very sick and to have difficulty breathing.  The child was provided with a nebulizer. but the \nne\\V foster mother did not know how to use it. and she was not provided with any instructions. \nAlthough Matthew did well at this home, he was returned to the prior home after only one \\Veek. \nLater examinations of that  home  found  that  Matthew  was  extremely  dirty  and  that  he  was \nconsistently sick at his day care center.  He was removed from the home after approximately 2 \nweeks. The Amended Complaint alleges that Matthew has suffered and continues to suffer harm as \na result of the Defendants' failure to provide the medical care and living environment required to \nmeet his needs. (~ 64-65). \nPlaintiff HughS. is 16 years old, and has been in the custody of the Department since 1996. \nHugh was turned into the Department by  his father.  who claimed that he  was not the child's \nbiological father. According to the Plaintiffs, the parental rights of the father were never terminated, \nand the Department has not located Hugh's natural  father or attempted to  locate a permanent \n8 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 9 of 36\nsubstitute family. In fact. Hugh has been subject to multiple placements. including many \\Vhich han' \nlasted only one night and he has often had inadequate and dirty clothing. (~67-68). \nLeanne G., is a two and one-half year old Black girl placed in a shelter at birth. Leanne was \nplaced in an inadequate foster home, and by 13 months old. she was still not on solid food and was \nkept in a crib or playpen.(,) 71 ).  According to the Amended Complaint the child's foster mother \nrefused to take the child to a doctor between March and September. 1999. and when a Department \nworker took the child, the worker was unable to provide any information to assist in the treatment. \nThe foster mother refused to attend the appointment.(~ 72).  The Plaintiffs also contend that Leanne \nhas not seen her five siblings in foster care for one year.  According to the Plaintiffs. the pattern of \npractice by the Department has resulted in a disparate impact on Black siblings and decreases the \nlikelihood of permanent placement. (~ 73-78). \nLeanne's sister, PlaintiffTammy G., is a nine year old Black foster child, who only saw her \nsiblings only once during the year prior to the filing of the Amended Complaint.  (~1 79).  Tam my \nresided in four separate homes in three years, and in one home she \\vas subject to being forced to \nstand with one leg in the air for considerable periods of time.  In another home. Tammy \\\\as \npunished by having the foster mother twist her am1 behind her back and twist her nose.  According \nto the Amended Complaint, this abuse was not adequately investigated by the Department which \n\\Vas consistent with its practice of being more tolerant of child abuse committed by Department \nagents  and providers than that allegedly committed by parents. (~ 80).  Presently, Tammy sleeps \n\\Vith three other children in a room attached to a converted garage. and is not being properly fed. ((T \n81 ).  The Amended Complaint also asserts that Tammy has not achieved a permanent home due to \nthe Defendant's failure to take the necessary steps including developing a sufficient number of \n9 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 10 of 36\nadoptive homes, which is based in part on the practice of treating Black and White foster children \ndifferently.  (~ 82, 83). \nElaine R. is an II year old who has been in foster care since I 993.  Her parental rights were \nterminated in 1997, and Elaine was placed for adoption \\vith a licensed foster family.  The father of \nthis foster family had a criminal record for sexually abusing children at the time of the placement. \nand Elaine was subjected to multiple sexual assaults and abuse for the nearly 12 months she resided \nin the home. Elaine was ultimately removed. and criminal charges were instituted against the foster \nfather.  (~85).  According to the Plaintiffs, a suitable adoptive parent has been found.  but the \nDefendants are delaying the adoption, thus denying the opportunity for a permanent family. (~86 ). \nThe Amended Complaint also alleges that Elaine has been separated for no reason from her siblings \nwho are also in foster care. (~85, 87). \nPlaintiff Paul B. is a 16 year old Black child who was placed under Department supervision \nin 1983 and remained there until entering foster care in 1993 at the age of 10.  Paul has had at least \n33  placements,  including  time  spent  in  a  shelter  facility  which  was  used  to  house juvenile \ndelinquents and violent offenders.(~ 88).  The repeated placements have caused Paul to fall behind \nin his education: denied him a good permanent family. and leaves him at substantial and imminent \nrisk of being subjected to the continued harms. (~!90). \nRachel C .. is 13 years old, and was improperly kept in a temporary shelter for over a year \nwhere she was housed with girls with significant mental health and delinquency histories. She left \nthe care of the Department for 2 months, but returned to their custody as a foster child and was \nplaced in a shelter. (~ 94). \nPlaintiff Cathy W. is 12 years old, and was held in a temporary shelter from May 1999. e\\'en \n10 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 11 of 36\nthough the Defendants knew that this placement had inadequate supervision and exposed her to \ndanger.  In  fact,  Cathy  was  involved  in  several  sexual  incidents at  the  shelter.  Cathy  \\vas \nsubsequently placed in a residential treatment facility. (~ 96. 97). \nLarrisa C.  was 2 years old in July, 2000, and while in foster care she was placed in a home \nwhere she was subjected to repeated abuse including traumatic brain injuries \\Vhich left her partially \nparalyzed with impaired vision and speech.  According to the Amended Complaint the Defendants \nfailed to screen the home adequately and to supervise the home once she \\vas placed.  (4.' 98). \nJohn L  age 12, entered the Defendant's custody in  1989 and has been in multiple foster \nplacements.  At one point, John was kept for over a year in an over-crowded foster home where he \n\\Vas  subjected to beatings and sadistic abuse.  The home had as many as  I 0 children present. \nalthough the Defendant's rules prohibited more than five children.  The Amended Complaint also \nasserts that the  Defendants failed to search for a suitable relative placement. although it  was \ndiscovered years after his entry into custody that an aunt \\Vas willing to care for him. (,]I 00. I 0 I). \nThe final Plaintiffs listed in the Amended Complaint are Melinda and Karina, sisters age I 7 \nand 18 who have been held in foster care since 1986.  According to the Amended Complaint the \nDefendants misled Melinda into signing a form ending foster care efforts, rather than participating \nin the subsidized independent living program.(~ 10 3). The Defendants also deprived Melinda ofthc \nopportunity to attend judicial and administrative revie\\vs addressing her status and have failed to \nprovide necessary transportation to attend any proceedings.  (~ 10 9).  Karina remains in foster care. \nNeither child was ever placed for adoption and no alternative form of permanency for either was \never pursued.  In fact, no effort was made to terminate the parental rights of the absent father. (~ \nI 03). \n11 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 12 of 36\nThe Plaintiffs allege that both girls have been subjected to rape, beatings and neglect in foster \ncare and that Melinda contracted syphilis when she was nine years old.  Both have been damaged \nby improperly administered psychotropic medications and suffer from permanent mental disabilities. \n(~ 104 ).  The Amended Complaint also asserts that the harm suffered by the children in not having \npermanent residences derived in part from the Defendants· practice of treating Black and \\'-/bite \nfoster children differently based on race and on the disparate impact on Black children from other \npractices. (~ 105. 10 6). \n(2) The Defendants \nThe Amended Complaint also addresses the role of the various named Defendants. (~ 111-\n116).  Governor Jeb Bush is identified as \"the person responsible for the proper operation of the \nfoster care and adoption systems and for the hiring and continued employment of Kathleen Kearney. \nSecretary ofDCAF.'' (~Ill). According to the Plaintiffs. Bush has responsibility to ensure that the \nDepartment operates in accord with federal law; that it protects the civil rights of children. and that \nthe system does not operate \"recklessly or with deliberate indifference to the needs. safety. lives and \nrights of Florida's foster children.\"(~ 1 I 2).  The Amended Complaint alleges that the Defendants \nknew of the deficiencies in the foster care/adoption system and have failed to take the necessary steps \nto operate it without violating the federally protected rights of the children. (~ I I 5 ). \n(3) The Causes of Action \nAllegations relating to each of the six causes of action are set out in the Amended Complaint. \nboth as part of a section entitled \"Statement of Facts'· (~ 139-217) and in the ··causes of Action·· \nsection(~ 221-226).  The specific allegations asserted in the Amended Complaint as related to each \n12 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 13 of 36\ncause of action are as follows: \n(a)  Substantive Due Process \nThe Plaintiffs allege that the actions and inactions ofthe Defendants deprived them of their \nbasic needs while in government custody and create conditions which are inconsistent with the \npurpose for which the Plaintiffs were taken into custody.  These acts also constitute arbitrary and \ncapricious decision-making and ·'amount to a pattern, practice and custom of deliberate indifference \nto the serious and constitutionally protected rights and needs of Plaintiffs and the putative class \nmembers.'' (~ 221 ). \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs have been deprived of the substantiYe \ndue  process  rights  conferred  on  them  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution including the failure to meet the basic needs tor food, clothing. safe care. shelter. \nmedical care and education: the right to protection from unnecessary harm or injury: the depri\\'ation \nof liberty: the right to not be retained in state custody longer than necessary to accomplish the goals \nof custody, and the right to eligibility determinations that are not arbitrary or capricious. (•; 221 ). The \nAmended Complaint asserts that these violations have resulted in serious physical. mental and \npsychological injuries to the children and the loss of their opportunity to develop in line with their \ninherent abilities.(~ 190). Specifically, the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' pattern and practice \nresult in various failures in providing the necessary care to the children including the following: \n(a) failing to screen, oversee and visit foster and pre-adoptive homes and facilities resulting \nin children being placed in dangerous, abusive, overcrowded and otherwise inappropriate facilities \n(~ 142): \n(b) ignoring or inappropriately responding to complaints or other information identifying \n13 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 14 of 36\nindividual homes as abusive or inappropriate(~ 143. 144): \n(c) failing to remedy various problems associated with the caseworkers employed by the \nDefendants including their large caseload, high level of turnover. lack of adequate supervision. \ntraining and management and the  failure  to  visit children  in  their placements with  sufficient \nfrequency to ensure the childrens' safety (~ 146, 148): \n(d)  the failure to develop, and the lack of, a sufficient number and array of placements to \naiiO\\v for the selection of a safe and proper placement for each child (~ 149): \n(e) the improper placement of children in temporary shelters or group homes on a long term \nbasis due to the lack of foster homes to accept the children (~ 150): \n(f) failure to provide foster homes for large sibling groups and teens which have resulted in \nthe unnecessary separation of siblings and the placement ofchildren in dangerous and inappropriate \nplacements (~ 152); \n(g)  the pattern and practice of moving children repeatedly from one place of custody to \nanother which has resulted in needless trauma to the children and undermined the child's stability \nand security. In some cases, the need for multiple moves has been caused by the Defendant's failure \nto exercise professional judgment which resulted in the placement of a child in a dangerous. abusive \nor inappropriate home in the first instance(~ 156-157). \n(h)  the lack of an efficient and competent mechanism or procedure to locate vacant foster \ncare beds and to properly match the children with an appropriate placement which results in the need \nfor the repeated placement of children into new settings(~ 158). \n(i)  failing to prepare foster parents to deal  with the predictable disruptive behavior of \nchildren placed in their homes and failing to support the foster parents \\vith services and other \n14 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 15 of 36\nassistance to allow the child to be maintained in the foster home (~ 160); \nmf ailing to identify relatives who are competent and willing to provide proper care for \nchildren  in  the  Defendants'  custody  and  ignoring  or  actively  discouraging  possible  relative \nplacements (~ 161, 162): \n(k) improperly excluding foster children and responsible adults from the decision making \nprocess concerning  individual  children thus depriving  the  children of the  possibility  that  the \ndecisions made which are critical to their well-being \\Vill be fully informed and competent (t1 163 ): \n(I)  failing to provide needed medical care for acute, chronic and congenital conditions or \nwith physician prescribed treatment (~ 164 ); \n(m)  wrongfully subjecting children to the administration of psychotropic medications to \nmake it more convenient and easier to care for children in an out of home setting rather than to \nimprove the mental or emotional health of the children (~ 165): \n(n)  systematically depriving children of access to an education because of the continual \nmoving of the children without monitoring their educational performance and in failing to provide \nneeded educational assistance (~ 166): \n( o) failing to provide children with adequate and season appropriate clothing or a timely paid \nclothing allowance (~ 167): \n(p) improperly attempting to reunify foster children with their biological families \\Vhen doing \nso remains obviously dangerous to the safety, health or well being ofthe child(~ 168, 169): \n( q)  wrongfully  retaining  children  in  foster  care  for  longer than  is  either  necessary  or \nappropriate, thus depriving them of an opportunity for a permanent family and making it less likely \nthey will be adopted and more likely that they will be subject to repeated moves and abuse.  This also \n15 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 16 of 36\nresults in an increase in the foster care population causing further overcro\\vding and greater risk of \nharm.(~ 172, 173). \n(r)  failing to provide the services needed by the biological families of children in out-of \nhome care. thus delaying reunification even if it is appropriate (~ 175): \n(s)  failing to look for adequate adoptive homes and/or wrongfully quickly giving up on \ntinding adoptive families for children who cannot be returned to their biological families or placed \nwith a relative (~ 178, 179); \n(t)  making arbitrary, capricious and fundamentally unfair decisions concerning which \nindividuals will be permitted to remain in foster care following their eighteenth birthday and \\Vhich \nindividuals will be permitted to participate in the subsidized Independent Living Program (~]182-\n187). \n(b) Procedural Due Process \nIn this cause of action, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants' actions and inactions \ndeprive them of state-created entitlements without the provision of an adequate and fair procedure \nincluding professional review of the failure to provide required visitation or medical consultation: \nfailing to provide the opportunity to submit applications to remain in foster care atler reaching 1g  \nyears of age or to participate in a subsidized Independent Living Program: failing to allow for the \nopportunity for an administrative hearing to challenge an adverse decision and notice of process. and \nthe  denial  of  the  right  to  be  present  and  provide  meaningful  input  at  judicial  review  and \nadministrative review proceedings.  (~192-200, 222).  According to the  Plaintiffs. the lack of \nadequate process in connection with the listed benefits deprives the Plaintiffs of due process in \nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment and constitutes '\"a pattern. practice and policy of deliberate \n16 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 17 of 36\nindifference to the serious and constitutionally protected needs and rights of Plaintiffs and the \nputative class members.''(~ 222). \n(c) Violation of First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments \nAccording to the Plaintiffs, the actions and inactions by the Defendants separate siblings in \nthe Defendant's custody and deprive the children of frequent and regular visitation. This separation \nis done without the necessary determination by a professional that keeping the siblings together or \nallowing visitation would be contrary to the health, safety or welfare of one of the children and has \nresulted in serious injury to the children.(~ 202-204). The Plaintiffs allege that these actions violate \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, and also deprive the children of their associational and familial rights \nin violation of the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Amended Complaint also asserts \nthat the children were deprived of constitutionally protected liberty interests without adequate or due \nprocess which violated the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Defendants' conduct amounted to \na ·•pattern, practice and custom of deliberate indifference\" to the constitutionally protected needs of \nthe Plaintiffs and the putative class members. (~ 223 ). \n(d) Adoption and Safe Families Act \nThe Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants have deprived them of rights afforded by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act including the right to have a proceeding initiated to terminate \nparental rights after 15 months of custody of the most recent 22 months: the right to have Defendants \noffer the biological family of the child the services necessary for the safe return of the child in on.kr \nto trigger the right to have a termination of parental rights proceeding initiated and the right of the \nDefendants to obtain required education and health information. (~206-208. 224 ). \n17 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 18 of 36\n(e) Early and Periodic Screenine. Diagnosis and Treatment \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, the Defendants actions and inactions denied the \nor \nPlaintiffs their rights under the Early and Periodic Screening. Diagnosis and Treatment provision \nthe  Social  Security  Act  to  receive  periodic  general  physical  health,  dentaL  hearing  and  eye \nexaminations; to receive all necessary and appropriate childhood vaccinations and boosters. and to \nreceive all follow up services and treatment deemed necessary to treat or address any condition. (1. \n209-210. 225). \n(f) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that eight of the Plaintiffs (Paul B .. Leslie F .. Laurie S., \nLillie S., Tammy G., Leanne G., Melinda and Karina) and members of the sought subclass were \ndenied their rights under Title VI to be free from discrimination in the administration and provision \nofbenefits of a federal program due to race, color or national origin.(~ 226). \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, the \"'Defendants have a pattern and practice of \ntreating Black foster children differently and Jess advantageously than White foster children. because \nof their race or color, with respect to access to. receipt of and the quality and value of services and \nbenefits:·(~ 214).  This treatment impacts the number of times foster children are moved from one \nplacement to another; the timing and effort with which Defendants pursue permanent families for \nthe children and the identification and placement of the child \\Vith an appropriate permanent family. \n(~ 214).  Additionally, the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants employ racially neutral criteria and \nmethods of administration that discriminate against Black foster children including the efforts to \nrecruit foster and adoptive families, the efforts to move children quickly to permanency, the process \nof selecting an appropriate foster family or facility and the recruitment and training of staff.(~ 216 ). \n18 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 19 of 36\nB.  The Applicable Standard \nFor purposes of a motion to dismiss. the complaint must be construed in a light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party and the court must take the allegations contained in the complaint \nas true. See, Harris v. Procter & Gamble Cellulose Co .. 73 F .3d 321 (11th Cir.  \\996 ).  A complaint \nshould not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the pleader \ncan prove no set of facts in support of the claim which \\Votdd entitle him to relief.  See, Con\\ev v. \nGibson. 355 U.S. 4 L 45-46. 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 ( 1957L Harris. 73 F.3d at 324. \nThe analysis of a 12(b)(6) motion is limited primarily to the face of the complaint and any \nattachments thereto.  Franklin v. Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Companv, 97 F.Supp.2d 1324. \n1326 (S.D. Fla. 2000).  Dismissal of a complaint is appropriate on the basis of a dispositive issue of \nlaw if no construction of the factual allegations will support the cause of action. See. Marshall \nCountv Board of Education v. Marshall County Gas District 992 F.2d 117L 1174 (11'h Cir. 1993). \nC.  The Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (D.E. #93) \nThe Defendants raise several multiple bases for the dismissal of each count of the Amended \nComplaint, as will be addressed below. \n(l) Compliance with the Pleading Requirements \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nThe Defendants contend that the Amended Complaint constitutes a ··shotgun·· pleading based \non the numerous allegations contained in each claim which are irrelevant to the causes ofaction. The \nPlaintiffs respond that the Amended Complaint ties the specitic factual allegations concerning the \nindividual children to the claims asserted. \nThe allegations of the Amended Complaint, as set out above, assert specific acts taken by the \nDefendants which impacted on the care or custody of specific children and tie these actions to \n19 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 20 of 36\nspecific asserted violations. While there may have been alternative methods of setting out the claims \nin a more efficient manner, this Court cannot find that the Amended Complaint is so deficient so as \nto  require further amendment prior to allowing this cause to  proceed.  Accordingly,  it  is  the \nrecommendation of this Court that the Motion to Dismiss on this basis be DENIED. \n(2) Eleventh Amendment Immunity \nThe Defendants assert that Eleventh Amendment immunity applies in this cause since the \nstate dependency courts are able to address the issues raised in this case, thus making the immunity \nexceptions  contained  in  Ex  parte  Young,  209  U.S.  123,  28  S.Ct.  44L  52  L.Ed.714  (1908) \ninapplicable.  The Plaintiffs argue that there is no Eleventh Amendment bar since the relief sought \nhere is prospective and the alleged illegal practices are continuous and ongoing. \nAn exception to the Eleventh Amendment bar exists ifthe Plaintiff is seeking prospective \nrelief against a state officer for ongoing violations of federal law.  See, Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. \nat 159-160:  Sandoval v.  Hagan, 197 F.3d. 484, 492 (11th Cir.  1999): Occean v.  Kearnev. 123 \nF.Supp.2d 618,  621  (S.D.  Fla.  2000).  In  the  present case,  the  Amended  Complaint  seeks  a \ndeclaration that certain acts by the Defendants are unconstitutional and unlawful and asks the Court \nto enjoin such practices and take remedial action to ensure that the Defendants comply \\vith all such \nlaws in the future.  As such, the Ex Parte Young exception applies and there is no  basis for \ndismissal.  Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss based on the Eleventh Amendment should be \nDENIED. \n(3) Rooker-Feldman, Abstention and Comin· \nThe Defendants contend that the claims in this case are barred by the application of the \nRooker-Feldman, abstention and comity doctrines which require that the federal courts defer to state \n20 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 21 of 36\ncourt proceedings.  The Plaintiffs counter that Rooker-Feldman is inapplicable since the case does \nnot seek review of a determination by a Florida dependency court or any relief that pertains to a \nparticular child.  Additionally, the claims challenge the Defendant's generally applicable practices \nrather than a court determination in a particular case. and thus. could not be asserted as part of a \ndependency court proceeding. \nThe Plaintiffs also contend that there is no basis for abstention since there is no possibility \nthat the relief sought in this case would interfere with any aspect of a state court proceeding or in the \ndecision making process of a state courtjudge concerning any individual child.  Additionally. the \nPlaintiffs argue that there is no opportunity to raise the federal claims in the dependency court \nproceedings. \nThe Rooker-Feldman doctrine, as set forth in Rooker v. Fidelitv Trust Companv. ~63 U.S. \n413, 44 S.Ct. 149. 68 L.Ed.2d 362 (1923) and District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman. \n460  U.S.  462,  103  S.Ct.  1303,  75  L.Ed.2d  206  (1983)  precludes  lower  federal  courts  ti·om \nconducting appellate review of decisions by the state courts.  The doctrine applies to claims actually \nraised in the state court as well as claims not raised but which are ''inextricably intertwined\" with \nthe judgment ofthe state court. Powell v. PowelL 80 F.3d 464.466-467 (11th Cir. 1996). quoting. \nFeldman, 460 U.S. at482, n.16, 103 S.Ct. at 1315. n.l6. \nThe federal case and the state court judgment will be seen as intert\\vined \"if the federal claim \nsucceeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.\" Siegel \\'. \nLePore. 234 F.3d 1163. 1172 (11th Cir. 2000), quoting. Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc .. 481  U.S.  L \n25.  107  S.Ct.  1519,  1533,  95  L.Ed.2d  1 (1987)(Marshall.  L  concurring).  Thus.  a  claim  is \ninextricably intertwined if approving the claim requires a determination that the decision reached by \n21 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 22 of 36\nthe state court was erroneous. Dow Jones & Company, Inc. v. Kave, 90 F.Supp.2d 1347. 1353 (S.D. \nFla. 2000). \nUnder the abstention doctrine, federal courts should not interfere with ongoing state court \nproceedings unless the Plaintiff show·s bad faith, harassment, or some other unusual  situation. \nYounger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 55,91 S.Ct. 746,27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971 ).  The doctrine should only \nbe invoked in rare circumstances since federal courts have the obligation to exercise the jurisdiction \nwhich is conferred by Congress. See, Kaye, 90 F.Supp.2d at 1353. Additionally. the doctrine should \nonly be applied if the plaintiffs in the federal action had the opportunity to present the federal claims \nin the state proceedings. See, Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415. 425. 99 S.Ct. 2371. 2378. GO L.Ed.2d \n994 ( 1979). \nIn the present case, the relief sought by the PlaintitTs and the allegations of the Amended \nComplaint as set out above, do not involve an on-going action dealing with a specific child. but \nrather,  seek action to  be  taken  for  system-wide problems.  There is  nothing  in  the  Amended \nComplaint which seeks to interfere with the power or discretion of the state courts. Additionally. the \nrelief sought in this case is directed to the presence of department wide violations. including federal \nconstitutional violations, which could not be dealt with as part of a dependency proceeding for an \nindividual child.  Thus. the shO\\ving required for applying either the Rooker-Feldman doctrine or \nabstention/comity are not present. See, LaShawn A. v. Kellv. 990 F.2d 1319. 1322-132] (D.C. Cir. \n1993).  Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss on this basis should be DENIED. \n(4) Early and Periodic Screenin&::. Diagnosis and Treatment \nCount V of the Amended Complaint  seeks  relief based on alleged violations of the Early \nand Periodic Screening. Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions found in 42 U.S.C. ~ 1396d \n22 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 23 of 36\n(r).  These provisions must be included in a state plan for medical assistance. 42 U.S.C. ~I J%a \n(a)(l O)(A): § 1396d(a). \nSection  1396d(r) provides  for  various  items and  services to  be  provided to  Medicaid \nrecipients, such as screening services, which includes a comprehensive health and developmental \nhistory. a comprehensive unclothed physical exam, appropriate immunizations. laboratory tests and \nhealth education. 42 U .S.C. § 1396d(r)(l ).  Additionally. the provision requires vision services. \ndental services, and hearing services. § 1396d(r)(2), (3), ( 4 ).  The focus of the present Motion to \nDismiss is on § 1396d(r)(5), which provides as follows: \n(5) Such other necessary health care, diagnostic services. treatment. \nand other measures described in subsection (a) of this section to \ncorrect or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and \nconditions discovered by the screening services. whether or not such \nservices are covered under the State plan. \nThe first argument raised by the Defendants is that the Plaintiffs lack standing to sue under \nthe EPSDT since the Amended Complaint fails to allege (I) that  they are receiving Medicaid \nservices: (2) that they are eligible for these services and (3) that specific medical treatment or \nservices are medically necessary and recommended as a result ofEPSDT screening. The Plaintiffs \nrespond that the Amended Complaint clearly sets out all of the elements necessary to assert this \nclaim. \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that the Defendants are required to ensure .. that all Florida \nMedicaid -eligible children up to the age oftwenty-one years. including Plaintiffs and the members \nof the putative class, receive comprehensive physicaL developmental and mental health care.\"(~ \n209).  Additionally.  the  Plaintiffs  state  that the  Defendants  fail  to  ensure  that  the  required \nexaminations and follow up services are provided, and that as a result. injuries and irreparable harm \n23 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 24 of 36\nhave occurred.  (~ 210, 219, 225).  According to the Amended Complaint. the failures  by  the \nDefendants ''amounts to a pattern, practice and custom of deliberate indifference to the serious needs \nand federally protected rights of Plaintiffs and the putative class members.'' (~; 225 ). \nThe Amended Complaint also alleges that one child has suflered from a cleft palate and other \nmedical needs which have not been addressed by the Defendants: that needed instruction was not \nprovided for a nebulizer needed by another child, and that a third child was not properly treated \nbased on the failure to take the child for medical care and the lack of information needed  for \ntreatment after the child was taken.(~ 14, 64, 72). \nThe allegations contained in the Amended Complaint. which must be taken as true on a \nMotion to Dismiss, contain all of the elements for the claim asserted as missing by the Defendants. \nAccordingly, the Motion to Dismiss Count Von this basis should be DENIED. \nAs a second ground for dismissal, the Defendants contend that there is no private right of \naction for the claim based on the denial of services required under 42 U.S.C.  ~  1396d (r)(5). \nAccording to the Defendants. this provision, as set forth above, is non-specific and fails to  set any \nstandards to measure the state's compliance. Thus, the administration of this provision is left to the \ndiscretion of the state. \nThe PlaintitTs respond to this argument by asserting that the Amended Complaint alleges the \nroutine failure by the Defendants to comply with any of the five categories found in ~ 1396d(r). \nAdditionally. even as to the challenged provision found in subsection ( 5 ). the Plaintiffs contend that \nthe provision simply requires the state to cover all medically necessary treatment 1or eligible children \nand that it is neither vague or amorphous. \nIn order to pursue a claim for liability in a section 1983 action. the Plaintiff must assert the \n24 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 25 of 36\nviolation of a federal right, not only a violation offederallmv. Doe v. Chiles. 136 F.3d 709. 713 \n(II th Cir. 1998). quoting, Blessing v. Freestone. 520 U.S. 329. II7 S.Ct. 1353. 1359. 137 L.Ed.2d \n569 ( 1997).  The factors to be applied to determine if a federal right is present were also discussed \nin Blessing, as follows: \nFirst, Congress must have intended that the provision in question \nbenefit the plaintiff.  Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the \nright  assertedly  protected  by  the  statute  is  no  so  ··vague  and \namorphous\" that its enforcement would strain judicial competence. \nThird, the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation \non the States. In other words, the provision giving rise to the asserted \nright must be couched in mandatory rather than precatory terms. \nId . (citations omitted). \nIf these three factors are shown, a rebuttable presumption arises that the statutory right is \nenforceable under section 1983. However, dismissal \\Vould still be proper if a remedy under~ 1983 \nwas specifically foreclosed by Congress either in the statute itself or by creating a comprehensi\\·e \nenforcement procedure incompatible with enforcement by individuals under~ 1983. The burden of \nmaking such a showing is with the Defendant. Doe. 136 F.3d at 718-719. quoting. Blessing. 117 \nS.Ct. at 1360, 1362. \nIn the present case. this Court finds that ~ l396d( r)( 5) satisfies the three-part test set out \nabove.  The Amended Complaint clearly alleges that the statute is intended for the benefit of the \nPlaintiffs  in  this cause  and  the  requirement of the  states  to  provide  such  services  is  clearly \nmandatory.  See, Pittman v. Secretary of Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. \n998 F .2d 887, 891-892 (11th Cir.  1993).  Finally, the provision at issue is  not so ··vague and \namorphous\" to not allow enforcement since it clearly defines what services are to be provided. See. \nMiller v. Whitbum, 10 F.3d. 1315 (7th Cir. 1993): Frew· v. Gilbert, I 09 F.Supp.2d 579 (E. D. Tex. \n25 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 26 of 36\n2000).  Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss on this basis should be DENIED. \nThe final basis for dismissal of Count V is the Eleventh Amendment.  According to the \nDefendants, the present case is actually one against Florida as a state, and the intricate remedial \nscheme of the Medicaid Act and its underlying basis via the Spending Clause. render the Ex Parte \nYoung exception inapplicable.  The Plaintiffs reject the contention that the claim is barred and point \nto the fact that only prospective relief is requested and on the nature of the remedial scheme of the \nMedicaid Act. \nAs  noted earlier. an exception to the Eleventh Amendment immunity  bar exists if the \nPlaintiff is seeking prospective relief against a state officer for ongoing violations of federal law. \nSee,ExParteYoung,209U.S.at 159-160: Sandovalv.Hagan.197F.3d 484.492(llthCir.1999): \nOccean v. Kearney, 123 F.Supp.2d 618, 621 (S.D. Fla. 2000).  In the present case. the Amended \nComplaint seeks a declaration that certain acts by the Defendants are unconstitutional and unlawful \nand asks the Court to enjoin such practices and take remedial action to ensure that the Defendants \ncomply with all such laws in the future.  Thus, the  Ex Parte Young exception applies and there is \nno basis for dismissal.  See also, Doe v. Chiles, 136  F.3d 709. 719-720 (lith Cir. 1998): Hunter v. \nChiles, 944 F.Supp. 914,917-918 (S.D. Fla. 1996) (rejecting claim that Eleventh Amendment bars \nsuit to enforce provisions ofthe Medicaid Act). \nBased on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Motion to Dismiss as directed to Count \nV be DENIED. \n(5) Adoption and Safe Families Act \nThe Defendants contend that Count 4. which seeks relief based on the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act (ASFA), should be dismissed as to all Plaintiffs since there is no private right of action. \n26 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 27 of 36\nor in the alternative, dismissed at least as to some Plaintiffs based on lack of standing.  According \nto the Defendants, the only requirement under the Act is that the state provide periodic judicial or \nadministrative review of a foster child's status.  Thus. the obligations sought to be asserted by the \nPlaintiffs are not ''unambiguously imposed\" by the statutory provisions. and therefore. no right of \nprivate enforcement exists.  The Defendants also note that the ASF A provided for  phased in \nenforcement: that a private right of action is clearly authorized for racial discrimination. which \nshO\\vs the Congressional intent to  not provide it for length of stay clause and  that the provision \nallows  for  discretion  by  the  executive  and judicial  branches  of the  state.  Additionally.  the \nDefendants argue that since the right  to any services under the statute relate solely to the return of \nthe child to the original home, relief is not available to those children '''hose parents have had their \nparental rights terminated or to any Plaintiffv,·ho has reached the age of I 8. \nIn response, the Plaintiffs state that the applicable test for the enforcement of a right pursuant \nto Section 1983 has been met since the statutory provision and the accompanying regulations sho,,· \nan unambiguous obligation on the state to comply with the requirement that the termination of \nparental rights be initiated in a timely manner and that medical and education records be provided. \nThe  Plaintiffs  also  contend that the  presence of an  express right of private action  tor  racial \ndiscrimination is not dispositive of a finding that there must be no right here since the provisions \nwere separate acts, legislated at different times to solve different problems.  According to the \nPlaintiffs. the right to private enforcement is shown by the lack of either an express prohibition or \nthe creation of a comprehensive enforcement scheme  by Congress at the time the 15/22 provision \nwas enacted. \nThe Plaintiffs further assert that the requirement to provide all services necessary for the \n27 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 28 of 36\nreturn to the home is not a separate claim. but rather. additional relief needed to achieve the  15 \nmonth parental termination requirement.  The Plaintiffs do not contest the lack of standing fl)r the \nindividuals mentioned in the Motion to Dismiss. but argue that it is irrelevant since no challenge has \nbeen made to the standing of Plaintiffs Reggie. Rebecca. Hugh and Karina to assert the claim on \ntheir own behalf and on behalf of the proposed class. \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. §67l(a)(16), a state plan must contain a ·'case review system.\" A case \nreview system is defined by 42 U.S.C. §675(5). as a procedure which assures that various services \nare provided to foster children. including the following.  for which relief is sought in the Amended \nComplaint: \n(D) a child's health and education record (as described in paragraph \n(1 )(A) is reviewed and updated, and supplied to the foster parent or \nfoster care provider with whom the child is placed, at the time of each \nplacement of the child in foster care; \n(E) in the case of a child who has been in  foster care under the \nresponsibility of the State for I 5 of the most recent 22 months .... the \nState shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights ofthe child's \nparents (or. if such a petition has been filed by another party. seek to \nbe joined as a party to the petition) and concurrently. to  identify. \nrecruit, process and approve a qualified family for adoption. unless-\n(i) at the option ofthe State, the child is being cared for by a relative: \n(ii) a State agency has documented in the case plan (which shall be \navailable for court review) a compelling reason for determining that \nfiling such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child: or \n(iii) the State has not provided to the family of the child. \nconsistent with the time period in the State case plan. such \nservices as the State deems necessary tor the safe return of \nthe child to the child's home, ifreasonable et1orts of the type \ndescribed in section 67l(a)(l5)(B)(ii) ofthis title are required to \nbe made with respect to the child: \nThe applicable criteria for determining whether a private right of action exists was set out in \n28 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 29 of 36\nthe previous section dealing with a cause of action under the EPSDT.  In applying the factors set out \nin Doe v. Chiles, this Court finds that 42 U.S.C. §675(5)(C) and 42 U.S.C. §671(a)( 16) satist~- the \nthree-part test set out above.  The Amended Complaint clearly alleges that the provisions are \nintended for the benefit of the Plaintiffs in this cause and the requirement of the states to provide \nsuch services is clearly  mandatory.  Finally, the provisions at  issue are  not  so \"'vague  and \namorphous\" to not allow enforcement. See, Occean v. Kearnev, 123 F.Supp.2d 618. 624-625 (S.D. \nFla. 2000).  Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss on this basis should be DENIED. \nHowever. this Court agrees with the Defendants that dismissal is proper as to Plaintiffs \nBonnie L., Laurie and Lillie S. since the rights of their parents have already been terminated. and \nas to Melinda since she has reached the age of 18.  Accordingly, it is recommended that the Motion \nto Dismiss as to Count 4 be DENIED in part and GRANTED in part. \n(6) Violation of Title Vl \nThe Defendants contend that Count 6 ofthe Amended Complaint, which seeks relief based \non violations of Title VI, should be dismissed based on a lack of standing by the named Plaintiffs. \nAccording to the Defendants, the Plaintiffs have failed to allege that they have been personally \nharmed by many of the alleged bad acts in the Amended Complaint.  Additionally. the Defendants \nargue that any claims against Plaintiff Melinda should be dismissed as barred by·  the Eleventh \nAmendment, and that all the claims are subject to dismissal under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. \nIn response. the Plaintiffs contend that the Amended Complaint adequately sets out claims \nfor both intentional discrimination and for racially discriminatory disparate treatment. Additionally. \nthe Plaintiffs note that the relief sought by Melinda relates to her claim of eligibility for future. \nprospective relief. and that Rooker-Feldman is inapplicable. \n29 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 30 of 36\nThe allegations ofthe Amended Complaint, which must be taken as true at this point in the \nproceedings. are sufficient to state the racial discrimination claims asserted by the Plaintiffs.  The \nallegations also show that the relief requested is only prospective, and thus. there is no Eleventh \nAmendment bar. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not constitute \na bar to the relief sought since it does not interfere nor it is \"\"inextricably intet1\\vined·· \\vith a pending \nstate court case.  Accordingly, it is the recommendation of this Court that the Motion to Dismiss \nCount 6 be DENIED. \n(7) Violation of First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments \nThe Defendants contend that Count 3 of the Amended Complaint should be dismissed since \nthere is no basis for a constitutional claim to have siblings either remain with each other in foster \ncare or to ensure that visitation \\Vith siblings in other homes is provided. \nIn response, the Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants\" practice and action of placing siblings \n111  separate  facilities  directly  infringes on the children \"s  constitutionally  protected  interest  in \ncontinuing their relationship with each other.  The Plaintiffs also contend that this protection \nextends to visitation between siblings. \nThere is no dispute between the parties in this case that \"\"there is a zone of privacy protecting \nmatters of personal family life insulated from government interference\"\" and that \"this right arises \nvariously under the first, ninth and fourteenth amendments. depending on the court looking at the \nmatter.\"' (Motion to Dismiss at 32-33 ).  The issue before this Court is whether the allegations of the \nAmended Complaint state a claim for a violation of this right. \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that children are separated and denied visitation without \na professional determination that allowing contact would be contrary to the child's interests or \n30 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 31 of 36\nhealth.  Additionally, the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants acted with ''deliberate indit1erencc·· \nto the constitutionally protected needs of the children. (~202-204. 223 ). \nThe allegations ofthe Amended Complaint, read in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. \nstate a claim for violation of the constitutional rights ofthe Plaintiffs by interfering with the right nl' \nassociation with their family  members. without regard to  the  impact on  the children.  These \nallegations are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. See. Marisol A. v. Giuliani. 929 F.Supp. \n662, 676-677  (S.D.  N.Y.  1996): Aristotle  P.  v.  Johnson,  721  F.Supp.  1002  (N.D.  !11.  1989). \nAccordingly, it is the recommendation ofthis Court that the Motion to Dismiss as directed to Count \n3 be DENIED. \n(8) Substantive and Procedural Due Process Violations \nThe Defendants assert that dismissal is proper for Count 1 (Substantive Due Process) and \nCount 2 (Procedural Due Process) since the Amended Complaint contains insutlicient facts to sho\\\\. \nthat the  harms that occurred to the children were the  result of deliberate  indifference  by  the \nDefendants.  The Plaintiffs respond that the professional judgment standard is in fact applicable \nrather than deliberate indifference. but that in any event either standard is met by the allegations of \nthe Amended Complaint. \nAs set out above, the provisions of the Amended Complaint relating to Substantive and \nProcedural Due Process contain great detail concerning the alleged wrongs committed by  the \nDefendants and clearly alleges that the acts were done in an arbitrary and capricious manner \\\\ith \ndeliberate indifference.  The arguments raised by the Defendants for the dismissal of Counts I and \n2 are refuted by the language of the Amended Complaint itself. and there is no basis for dismissal. \nAccordingly, it is the recommendation of this Court that the Motion to Dismiss Counts I and 2 be \n31 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 32 of 36\nDENIED. \n(9) Claim Preclusion Based on Other Actions \nIn the Motion to Dismiss the Defendants contend that a number of the children named as \nPlaintiffs were part of a prior suit, Children A-F, Case No. 90-2416-CIV -KEHOE. which was settled \nin 1995.  According to the Defendants, the settlement agreement entered in that case precludes suit \nfor any allegations occurring prior to March, 1995.  The Plaintiffs refute this contention. and argue \nthat as to the Plaintiffs who were also members of the A-F class. there would be no claim preclusion \nfor actions or inactions ofthe Defendants which occurred after July 15, 1995. the date the A-F case \nwas dismissed with prejudice or for claims asserted in this litigation (the First Amendment. Ninth \nAmendment and Title VI claims) but not asserted in A-F. \nWhile the issue of overlapping claims may impact on the availability and scope of the class \naction determination. which will be addressed by a separate Report and Recommendation to be \nissued by this Court. for purposes of a motion to dismiss. this Court finds that the  Amended \nComplaint adequately sets out injuries for each claim asserted that \\Vould not be foreclosed by the \nearlier settlement either because it arose after the settlement or since it is on-going.  Furthermore. \nthere is no basis for dismissal due to the pending action in M.E. v. Chiles. 90-1 008-CIV -MOORE. \nAccordingly. it is the recommendation of this Court that the Motion to Dismiss based on claim \npreclusion be DENIED. \nD.  The Motion to Dismiss by Governor Bush (D.E. #94) \nThe  Motion  to  Dismiss  filed  by  Governor  Bush  adopts  the  arguments  made  in  the \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss and also contends that the dismissal is proper since the Governor \nmay not be held liable for any purported violation in the Amended Complaint. \n32 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 33 of 36\nThe Plaintiff is not required to show personal action by defendants individually in order to \nobtain injunctive relief against state officers in their official capacity.  Rather. the only requirement \nis that the official be responsible for the challenged action. Luckev v. Harris. 860 F.2d 1012. I 015 \n(11th Cir. 1988). In explaining this standard, the Eleventh Circuit cited to Ex parte YoutH!. 209 U.S. \n123.28 S.Ct. 441,52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), and stated: \nAs the Young court held. it is sufficient that the state officer sued \nmust, \"by virtue of his office, ha[ve]  some connection'' with the \nunconstitutional  act  or  conduct  complained  of.  [W]hether  [this \nconnection) arises out of general law, or is specially created by the act \nitself, is not material so long as it exists:· \nLuckey, 860 F.2d at 1015-1016, quoting, Young, 209 U.S. at 157.28 S.Ct. at 453. \nAs set out above. the Amended Complaint alleges that the \"Defendants .. committed \\'arious \nacts or failed to  carry out required duties resulting in harm to the Plaintiffs.  According to the \nPlaintiffs, the Governor is included in the term \"Defendants.'' Additionally. the Amended Complaint \ncontains specific allegations concerning the role and responsibility of the Governor. (tl  111-116 ). \nThese allegations, which must be taken as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss. are sufficient \nto allow for the case to  proceed at this stage as against the Governor.  Accordingly. it  is  the \nrecommendation ofthis Court that the Motion to Dismiss filed by Governor Jeb Bush ( D.E. #94) be \nDENIED. \nII.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION \nBased on the foregoing, the recommendation of this Court is as follows: \n(l) The Motion to Dismiss tiled by the Defendants (D.E. #93) should be DENIED as to \nCounts I, 2, 3, Sand 6  and DENIED in part and GRANTED in part as to Count 4, as set out \nabove. \n33 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 212   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2001   Page 34 of 36\n(2) The Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant Governor Jeb Bush (D.E. #94) should be \nDENIED. \nPursuant to Local Magistrate Rule 4(b). the parties have I 0 days from service of this Report \nand Recommendation to serve and file written objections. if any. \\vith the Honorable Federico A. \nMoreno.

OF  FLA. \net. a/., \nDefendants. \nI \n---------------------------------\nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFFS' EMERGENCY MOTION FOR \nTEMPORARY INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL \nOn May 29, 2001, Plaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion for Temporary Injunction Pending \nAppeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P 62(c). Rule 62(c) provides that the court in its discretion may grant \nan injunction during an appeal of an order denying an injunction.  Having failed to persuade this \nCourt that it should grant an injunction on the merits and prevent Defendants from terminating \nPlaintiff's benefits,  Plaintiff now seeks to  have this Court temporarily enjoin Defendants from \nterminating her benefits while her appeal is before the Eleventh Circuit. \nAs grounds,  Plaintiff directs  the  attention of the  Court to  Subparagraph  IV.B.  of an \nattachment to Defendants'  April  11,  2001  Response Regarding the  Status of Agreement for \nContinued Services.  That subparagraph states: \nThe recipient by executing this agreement does not waive or agree to waive any state \nor federal constitutional rights that she may have.  At the same time, the recipient \nunderstands and agrees that the Department is authorized to terminate the agreement \nif  the  recipient  fails  to  comply  with  any  of the  terms  of the  agreement, \nnotwithstanding a contention that the noncompliance is an exercise of a constitutional \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 259   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/11/2001   Page 2 of 4\nright. \nProposed  Agreement  for  Continued  Services  at  ~ IV.B.  Plaintiff argues  that  the  Court's \nunderstanding of Defendants' position is contradicted by the language ofthat subparagraph. \nIn its April30, 2001 Order, the Court acknowledged in its holding that Defendants' proposed \nwritten service agreement is ambiguous about whether signing the agreement would result in the \nrelinquishment  of  constitutional  rights  and  nothing  in  Plaintiff's  submission  alters  this \nunderstanding.  Plaintiffs submission makes Plaintiffs lack of standing and ripeness evident as the \nCourt was not and has not been presented with a complete and final agreement with which to rule \non the underlying constitutional issues raised by Plaintiff. \nSubparagraph IV.B. does not constitute a waiver of constitutional rights at the moment the \nindividual signs the agreement as Plaintiff contends.  Instead, it allows for the possibility that the \nDepartment will be able to terminate the benefits for the failure to comply with any of the terms of \nthe agreement.  Plaintiff must show that she is in immediate danger of sustaining a direct injury as \na result of the conduct of Defendants, and not just a conjectural or hypothetical injury. City ofL  os \nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-2, 103 S.Ct 1660, 1665 (1983). \nAfter  receiving Defendants'  response  filed  on  June  6,  200 I  to  Plaintiff's  motion for \ntemporary injunction pending appeal,  it now appears that the motion is moot in any  event as \nDefendants have agreed to continue services to Plaintiff Leslie F. for 45 days or until the Eleventh \n-2-\n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 259   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/11/2001   Page 3 of 4\nCircuit rules.

Hand, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Alabama, sitting by designation. \n \n \n1  The plaintiffs who filed the amended complaint are: Bonnie L., Reggie B., Rebecca B., Laurie S., Lillie S., Leslie F., Sandra M., \nTanya M., Candice D., Jay D., Matthew I., Hugh S., Leanne G., Tammy G., Elaine R., Paul B., Rachel C., Cathy W., Larissa C., \n \nJohn J., Melinda, and Karina. \n \n2  The class description was later modified to exclude children who were plaintiffs in a separate class action involving only children \nin foster care in Broward County. \n \n \n3  Because of that settlement, none of the plaintiffs filed an amendment to the complaint repleading those claims, even though the \ndistrict court’s dismissal of them had been without prejudice. \n \n \n4  They are: Reggie B., Rebecca B., Laurie S., Lillie S., Tanya M., Leanne G., Tammy G., Elaine R., Rachel C., Larissa C., and John \nJ. \n \n \n5  Although the disparate impact portion of the black children’s Title VI claims in Count VI was also dismissed with prejudice, the \nplaintiffs do not contest that ruling. \n \n \n6  In addition to injury in fact, plaintiffs must also allege that their injuries are “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court,” and that it is likely the injury will \n \nbe redressed if the court rules in their favor. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1163, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997). \nThese aspects of standing are not disputed in this case. According to the amended complaint, the defendants’ failures caused the \nplaintiffs’ injuries and their continued failures are likely to cause further injuries. The plaintiffs do allege that their injuries are \nrelated to the challenged conduct of the defendants. Therefore, the alleged injuries suffered by the plaintiffs are fairly traceable to \nthe conduct of the defendants. In addition, the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment and prospective injunctive relief that will \nprevent the defendants from violating their constitutional and federal statutory rights. The relief the plaintiffs seek would clearly \nremedy their claimed injuries. \n \n7  The district court did not decide this question, instead dismissing the plaintiffs’ Adoption Act claims as barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment under Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996). In view of our \n \nconclusion that the Adoption Act claims are due to be dismissed on other grounds, we need not address the Eleventh Amendment \nissue. McClendon v. Ga. Dep’t of Cmty. Health, 261 F.3d 1252, 1258–59 (11th Cir.2002). \n  15 \n \n\n31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255 (2003)   \n \n \n \n8  Part B creates a joint federal-state program that provides federal funds for child welfare services. In order to be eligible for these \nfunds, 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(10)(B)(ii) requires that each state have a plan for child welfare services that “provide[s] assurances that \n \nthe State—is operating, to the satisfaction of the Secretary—a case review system (as defined in section 675(5) of this title) for \neach child receiving foster care under the supervision of the State.” Another provision, 42 U.S.C. § 626(b)(3), requires that, in \norder for states to receive funds for projects for the development of alternate care arrangement for infants who do not need to be in \nhospital settings, the state develop “a case review system of the type described in § 675(5) of this title” for each infant. \nThe plaintiffs have not sued under either 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(10)(B)(ii) or § 626(b)(3), which are in Part B, and instead have \nrepeatedly said that their claims arise under Part E. Section 671(a)(16) is the only section in Part E that refers to a “case review \nsystem.” So, we have confined our consideration to it. However, other courts have found that § 622(b)(10)(B)(ii), at least, does \nnot confer an enforceable right. See Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F.Supp.2d 476, 485–89 (D.N.J.2000) (§ 622(b)(10)(B)(ii) is not \nso unambiguous as to confer a right enforceable under § 1983); Eric L. v. Bird, 848 F.Supp. 303, 312 (D.N.H.1994) (plaintiffs \nhave no enforceable right to compel state’s implementation of programs under predecessor to § 622(b)(10)(B)(ii)). \n \n9  The genealogy of the Luckey case is: Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir.1988) (“Luckey I ”); Luckey v. Harris, 896 F.2d \n479 (11th Cir.1989) (“Luckey II ”); Harris v. Luckey, 918 F.2d 888 (11th Cir.1990) (“Luckey III ”); Luckey v. Miller, 929 F.2d 618 \n \n(11th Cir.1991) (“Luckey IV ”); and Luckey v. Miller, 976 F.2d 673 (11th Cir.1992) (“Luckey V ”). \n \n10  Some of the provisions that the Tenth Circuit cited as “[p]articularly problematic” under Younger included provisions governing \nassessment and treatment planning conferences for children entering the Department of Human Services’ custody and periodic \n \nreview of the Department’s plans for those children. Joseph A., 275 F.3d at 1267–68. \n \n11  The plaintiffs argue that the requested relief would not interfere because it is directed solely at the Department of Children and \nFamilies and not the state courts. We previously rejected essentially that same argument in Luckey V, and we reject it again here. In \n \nthat case, the plaintiffs sued the Governor of Georgia and all state court judges who presided over prosecutions of indigent \ndefendants. 976 F.2d 673, 678. The plaintiffs contended that the relief they requested against the Governor of Georgia would not \ninterfere with state court proceedings because the onus to comply would be on the state executive and not the judiciary. Id. We \nobserved that “a case cannot be decided in a vacuum, and the potential enforcement difficulties of any order reforming such an \nintegral aspect of a state criminal justice process as the indigent defense system would be significant.” Id. at 679. This case raises \nthe same concerns that Luckey V did, and the federal court relief the plaintiffs seek would interfere with the ongoing state \ndependency hearings, even if it were directed against the Department and state officers, instead of state courts and judges. \n \n12  In LaShawn A. ex rel. Moore v. Kelly, 990 F.2d 1319, 1323–24 (D.C.Cir.1993), the Court held that the District of Columbia’s \njuvenile review proceedings did not provide the plaintiffs an adequate opportunity to raise their constitutional challenges. The \n \nplaintiffs in that case brought a class action on behalf of children who were in foster care under the supervision of the District of \nColumbia Department of Human Services, alleging widespread federal constitutional and statutory violations. The D.C. Circuit \naffirmed the district court’s decision that Younger abstention was not warranted after noting that the family court had “explicitly \nrejected the use of review hearings to adjudge claims requesting broad-based injunctive relief based on federal law” in In re Brim, \nNo. 489–80 (D.C.Super.Ct. July 20, 1984). In the Brim case the family court had denied a motion by two children for injunctive \nrelief against the Department for its alleged mishandling of Social Security disability payments it had collected on the children’s \nbehalf and noted that the appropriate forum for such issues is federal court. LaShawn A., 990 F.2d at 1323. The D.C. Circuit \ntherefore rejected Younger abstention because “there was no pending judicial proceeding in the District of Columbia which could \nhave served as an adequate forum for the class of children in this case to present its multifaceted request for broad-based injunctive \nrelief based on the Constitution and on federal and local statutory law.” Id. \nIn contrast to the D.C. Circuit, however, in this circuit’s Younger decisions, we have not determined whether the broad relief the \nplaintiffs would prefer is available but instead whether the forum itself is adequate for addressing the claims and providing a \nsufficient remedy to the individual plaintiffs. In the Luckey case, the plaintiffs sought broad-based injunctive relief to reform \nGeorgia’s indigent defense system. Luckey V, 976 F.2d at 676. Although we did not expressly address the third Middlesex factor \nin our opinion in that case, we did affirm the district court’s decision to abstain under Younger. Id. at 679. The decision turned \non the fact that the Luckey plaintiffs could have brought their challenges in their individual criminal trials, even though it is \nobvious that the broad-sweeping remedy they sought was unavailable there. “Equity need not intervene immediately in \nplaintiffs’ state trials. Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law for any ineffective assistance of counsel they may actually \nreceive. Most important, they can present objections to sixth amendment violations at their state trials and in their state appeals.” \nLuckey v. Harris, 896 F.2d 479, 482 (11th Cir.1989) (“Luckey II ”) (Edmondson, J., dissenting). \n \n \n \n \n   \n  16 \n \n\n31 Foster Children v.

Moreno, United States District Judge.  This Court has reviewed the motion. the file in \nthis cause and has heard argument of counsel. \nI.  DISCUSSION \nThe present motion seeks to have this Court certify a Plaintiff class consisting of all children \nwho are currently or who will be in the custody of the Defendants as an alleged or adjudicated \ndependent child.  Additionally, the Plaintiffs seek the certification of a sub-class consisting of all \nchildren \\Vho are Black or are perceived by Defendants as being Black who are currently or \\vho will \nbe in the custody of Defendants as an alleged or adjudicated dependent child.  0 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 2 of 11\nA.  The Allegations of the Amended Complaint \nThe Amended Complaint in this case seeks declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 based on various alleged violations of the rights of the Plaintiffs \\vho are children in \nthe Defendants' custody.  The Amended Complaint asserts causes of action for Substantive Due \nProcess (Count 1) : Procedural Due Process (Count 2): Violations of the First. Ninth and Fourteenth \nAmendments (Count 3); Violation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act (Count 4): Violation of \nthe Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment provisions of Medicaid (Count 5)and \nViolation of Title VI ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Count 6). \nThe  allegations  of the  Amended  Complaint  are  set  out  m  detail  in  the  Report  and \nRecommendation entered by this Court on the Motions to Dismiss and are incorporated herein. \nAdditionally,  the Amended Complaint contains \"Class Action Allegations·· (~117-137). which are \nset forth below. \n(1) The System-Wide Class \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that every child in the Florida foster care system is directly \naffected by the failure of the Defendants to comply with accepted professional standards and exercise \ncompetent judgment.  These children routinely have their federally protected rights deliberately \ndisregarded and are likely to be harmed.  (~ 118).  According to the Amended Complaint the \nPlaintiffs are members ofthe class they seek to represent. and each Plaintiff and each putative class \nmember (with one possible exception) is currently in the Defendants' custody.  Additionally. the \nclass  is  so  numerous  (between  15,000  to  18,000) as  to  make joinder of all  class  members \nimpracticable, and there are questions of law or fact  common to the Plaintiffs and the members of \nthe class they seek to represent. (~ 119-121 ). \n2 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 3 of 11\nSpecifically. the Amended Complaint indicates that common questions of fact include \nwhether Defendants fail to provide safe. stable and secure foster care as required by law: whether \nthe Defendants fail to provide legally required services including medical and educational services. \nand whether the Defendants fail to promptly take steps to secure a permanent. legally stable family \nfor  the  children.  (~  122).  The  issues  of lavv·  common  to  the  Plaintiffs  include  whether  the \nDefendants'  actions  and  inactions  violate  rights  secured  by  the  First.  Ninth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and whether the Defendants violate the Adoption \nAssistance and Safe Families Act and the EPSDT provisions of the Social Security Act.(~ 123 ). \nThe Amended Complaint also alleges that the claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims \nof other class members. Specifically. each Plaintiff and class member is in need of adequate and safe \nfoster care, relies on the Defendants for the provision of all care. treatment and services and are \nbanned by the failure ofthe Defendants to meet their obligations.  Additionally. the relief addressed \nto the putative class members' claims will also address the claims and injuries ofthe individually \nnamed Plaintiffs. (~ 121. 124 ). \nAccording to the Plaintiffs, they will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class \nand since the Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to all class \nmembers. final injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n(~ 125-126). \n(2) Subclass of Black Foster Children \nIn addition to the main claim. Plaintiffs Paul B .. Leslie F .. Laurie S. and Lillie S .. Tammy \nG .. Leanne G .. Melinda and Karina seek to certify a subclass \"'of all children who are Black or are \nperceived by Defendants as being Black and are or will be in the custody of Defendants as an alleged \n3 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 4 of 11\nor dependent child.\" (~ 128).  The allegations relating to the subclass incorporate the allegations \nrelated to the system wide class and also set out facts specific to the claims.  The subclass is \ndescribed as too numerous for joinder (over 6,000 children) and the Plaintiffs allege that there are \ncommon questions of Jaw and fact. (~131-132). \nThe common factual questions include whether Black foster children are treated differently \nbecause of their race or color and whether the Defendants use racially neutral criteria or methods in \nadministering foster care and adoption services which have a disparate impact on Black children or \ndefeat or impair the objectives of foster care and adoption services for Black foster children. (~1133 ). \nCommon questions of law cited by the Plaintiffs include \\Vhether the treatment of Black foster \nchildren constitutes illegal discrimination in violation of Title VI and whether the racially neutral \ncriteria or methods used by the Defendants illegally discriminate against Black foster children in \nviolation of Title VI. (~ 134 ). \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that the legal claims and injuries suffered by the Plaintitf<> \nare typical and representative of the putative subclass and the relief addressed to the subclass \nmembers claims and injuries will also address the claims and injuries of the Plaintiffs. (.-; 13 5 ). \nAdditionally, the Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests ofthe subclass and since \nthe  Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally  applicable to  all  subclass \nmembers. final injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate \\vith respect  to the subclass as a \n\\vhole. (~ 136-13 7). \nB.  The Applicable Standard \nIn order to allow for class certification, the moving party must show that the requirements \nof Rule 23(a). Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  and one of the alternative requirements of Rule \n4 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 5 of 11\n23(b) have been met. Jackson v. Motel 6 Multipurpose, Inc., 130 F.3d 999, I 005 (11th Cir. 1997). \nRule 23(a) provides as follows: \n(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action.  One or more members of a class \nmay sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (I) \nthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the \nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class, and ( 4) the representative parties \\Viii \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nUnder Rule 23(b)(2), the following additional requirement must be met to maintain a class \naction: \n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole: \nThe four prerequisites to class certification under Rule 23(a) are commonly referred to as \n\"numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy of representation.\" Prado -Steiman v. Bush. 21 I \nF.3d 1266, 1278 (11th Cir. 2000).  The requirements of commonality and typicality both focus on \nthe issue of whether there is a sufficient connection between the legal claims brought by the named \nclass  representatives  and  those  of the  individual  class members.  Id.  In  order to  satisfy  the \ncommonality requirement the class action must involve issues that are susceptible to class \\vide \nproof.  Murray  v.  Auslander,  244  F.3d 807,  811  (lith Cir.  2001 ).  The  party  seeking  class \ncertification can meet the requirement of  typicality by  show·ing '\"a  strong similarity of legal \ntheories ... despite substantial factual differences.\" Prada-Steiman, 221 F.3d at 1279.n. 14. quotinu. \nAppleyard v. Wallace, 754 F.2d 955, 958 (11th Cir. 1985). \nPrior to the certification of a class, \"the district court must determine that at least one named \nclass representative has Article III standing to raise each class subclaim.\" Prada-Steiman, 221  F.3d \n5 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 6 of 11\nat 1279. In making this determination, \"each claim must be analyzed separately·. and a claim cannot \nbe asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one named plaintiff has suffered the injury that giws \nrise to that claim.\" ld. at 1280, quoting, Griffin v. Dugger, 823 F.2d 1476. 1483 (11th Cir. 1987). \nFurthem1ore, in making the certification determination, the court should insure that it does not certifY \na class which overlaps with certified classes in other related pending litigation. ld. at 1282. \nC.  The Motion for Certification \nThe arguments raised by the Defendants in opposition to the motion for class certification \nfocus on standing and the typicality and commonality elements addressed above.  Spe<..:itically. the \nDefendants contend that the class certification sought in this case should be denied since many· of \nthe claims are barred by prior and pending  litigation and that the named Plaintiffs lack standing to \nbring many of the claims asserted. \nThe Defendants rely on the presence of three earlier filed suits to support their argument that \nthe class certification sought by the Plaintiffs should be denied. The three cases. M.E. \\'.Chiles. 90-\n1008-CIV-MOORE: A-F v. Chiles, 90-2416-CIV-KEHOE and Ward v. Kearnev. 98-7137-CIV \nMORENO. all dealt with complaints brought by children in the custody of the Department. and each \nsought specific remedies based on alleged wrongs. \nIn their supplemental filing (D.E. # 163 at p. 3), the Plaintiffs concede that the main class and \nsub-class should be certified absent the members of the Ward class (children in District I 0). thus. \nthe impact of this case does not have to be addressed. \nThe A-F case resulted in a settlement and a final order of dismissal by Judge Kehoe in .July. \n1995. The Defendants contend that the claims of any child in state custody prior to the dismissal arc \nbarred by the prior case, and note that the allegations of the Amended Complaint do not clearly shO\\\\ \n6 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 7 of 11\nthat the claims now  brought by these children arose prior to the dismissal.  The Plaintiffs counter \nthat the settlement of A-F specifically contemplated bringing future actions for new claims such as \nthe relief sought in  the Amended Complaint. which  focus  on  injuries which the  children are \nexperiencing now or under the threat of experiencing in the future. \nA review of the record before this Court shows that the settlement reached in A-F would bar \nany claim which arose prior to July.  1995. but would not preclude the certification of a class \nincluding members who were in custody prior to that date. but whose claims arose after that date. \nThe allegations of the Amended Complaint assert on-going violations. and to the extent such \nviolations occurred after July, 1995, they should be properly included in this action. \nThe Plaintiffs in M.E., have certified a class consisting of\"all children who are now or in the \nfuture will be in the legal or physical custody of the State of Florida, including children who are \ndependent or delinquent. whom the State kno\\vs or should know have a need for mental health \nservices or developmental services.\" While there are some similarities between the relief sought in \nM.E. and that sought in the present case. the relief sought here is clearly beyond the scope of mental \nhealth services.  Thus. there should be no blanket preclusion of class certification based on M.E. \nHowever. it  does appear that there may be individual cases where the relief sought \\Vould  be \navailable in the M.E. action.  Therefore, any claims for mental health and developmental services \nshould be addressed in M.E. rather than in the present case. \nThe Defendants also assert that many of the class members and many of the claims should \nbe excluded due to  lack of standing.  This argument is  based on the  Defendants'  underlying \ncontention that the claims should be looked at district by district rather than statewide.  1-lo\\vever. \nthe Amended Complaint in this case clearly alleges that the problems sought to be remedied are \n7 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 8 of 11\nsystem-wide and are the result of policies and procedures administered on a statewide level by state \nofficials.  These allegations are sufficient to allow for a state wide class, thus vitiating the standing \nargument. \nThe Defendants also raise an argument relating to the need for individualized factual proof \nfor each of the claims.  However, this Court finds that the factual distinctions do not preclude a \nfinding that the requirements for class certification has been met.  In the present case. the injuries \nare claimed to have been brought about by practices which impact all of the children and the \nrequested relief is  applicable to the named Plaintiffs and the putative class members.  This allows \nfor a finding that the requirements of commonality and typicality have been met. \nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, it is the recommendation of this Court that the \nfollowing class be certified in this cause: \nAll children who are currently or \\Vill be in the custody of the Florida \nDepartment of Children and Families as an alleged or adjudicated \ndependent child, excludine the following: (a) children who reside in \nBroward/District 10 ; (b) children who were in the custody of the \nDepartment prior to July 24, 1995. but only  for claims \\Vhich arose \nprior to that date and (c) any claims for the failure to provide mental \nhealth and/or developmental services. \nAdditionally, this Court finds that the Plaintiffs have shown the necessary elements for the \ncertification of a subclass.  The arguments raised by the Defendants directed tO\\vard the likelihood \nof success of the claim are not determinative of whether the class should be certified. See, Eisen v. \nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156,94 S.Ct. 2140,40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974); Walco Investments v. \nThenen,  168 F.R.D. 315, 329 (S.D. Fla.  1996).  Accordingly, this Court recommends that the \nfollowing subclass be certified in this cause: \nAll children who are Black or identified by the Defendants as Black. \nwho are currently, or will be in the custody of the Florida Department \n8 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02116-FAM   Document 220   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/11/2001   Page 9 of 11\nof Children and Families as an alleged or adjudicated dependent \nchild.  excludin~  the  following:  (a)  children  who  reside  in \nBroward/District I 0; (b) children who were in the custody of the \nDepartment prior to July 24. I995, but only  for claims \\Vhich arose \nprior to that date and (c) any claims for the failure to provide mental \nhealth and/or developmental services. \nII.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION \nBased  on the  foregoing,  it  is  the  recommendation of this  Court  that  the  Motion  for \nCertification of a Class and a Subclass (D.E. #50) be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as \nset out above. \nPursuant to Local Magistrate Rule 4(b), the parties have I 0 days from service of this Report \nand Recommendation to serve and file written objections. if any. \\Vith the Honorable Federico A. \nMoreno.
